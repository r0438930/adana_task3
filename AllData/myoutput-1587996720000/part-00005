It also drew attention to unlawful [[gambling]] and drug activities which authorities claim often accompany dog fighting. Subsequently, Vick and three other principals were convicted of [[federal offense]] conspiracy charges and imprisoned. Vick was suspended by the [[NFL]], was ordered to pay the Atlanta Falcons back a portion of his earnings, and lost endorsement deals worth millions more. With other creditors also attempting to collect millions of dollars in debts, in July 2008, he filed for [[Chapter 11]] (reorganization) bankruptcy protection.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Michael-Vick Jets-vs-Eagles-Sept-3-2009 Post-Game-Interview (cropped).jpg|thumb|Michael Vick]]\nThe Bad Newz dog fighting investigation began in April 2007 with a search of property in [[Surry County, Virginia|Surry County]], [[Virginia]], owned by [[Atlanta Falcons]]\u2019 football [[quarterback]] [[Michael Vick]], and the subsequent discovery of evidence of a [[Dog fighting in the United States|dog fighting]] ring in [[Newport News, Virginia]]. Over 70 dogs, mostly [[pit bull terrier]]s, with some said to be showing signs of injuries, were seized along with physical evidence during several searches of Vick's {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} property by local, state and federal authorities.\n\nIn July 2007, Vick and three other men were indicted on [[federal offense]] and state [[felony]] charges relating to a six-year-long continuing criminal enterprise of an interstate dog fighting ring known as \"Bad Newz Kennels\", based upon a local nickname for [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], Vick's hometown.{{citation needed|reason=removed dead bare-URL ref with no archived copies since 2007|date=February 2020}} Allegations included Vick's direct involvement in dog fighting, high-stakes [[gambling]], and brutal executions of dogs. Public outcry resulted from widespread news media publicity of the details which included hanging, drowning, electrocuting, \"slamming\", and shooting dogs. There were public demonstrations by both Vick supporters and animal rights activists. In consequence, many companies who had been paying for his endorsements withdrew Vick products from retail marketing when he was convicted.\n\nBy August 20, all the defendants on the initial federal charges including Vick had agreed to guilty pleas under [[plea bargain]] agreements, apparently avoiding facing the possibility of additional and more serious charges under the powerful [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]].<ref name=autogenerated15>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?id=2974225 |title=Two more plea deals spell serious trouble for Vick |website=ESPN Sports |date=2007-08-15 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}</ref><ref name=\"ESPNPlea\">{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2983121 |title=Vick faces prison time after agreeing to plead guilty|website=ESPN Sports |accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref> U.S. District Court Judge [[Henry E. Hudson]], who was not bound by sentencing recommendations in plea agreements, had previously advised two of the defendants that the aggravated circumstances involving executing the dogs warranted an upward revision of the sentencing guidelines. The single felony charges carry a maximum sentence of five years.\n\nOn November 30, Peace and Phillips were sentenced by Judge Hudson to 18 and 21 months in [[federal prison]] respectively. The punishments were higher than recommended by federal prosecutors, and included three years of supervised probation following their release from prison. During the sentencing, an attorney for Quanis Phillips argued that his client came from a culture in which [[dog fighting]] was an accepted practice. He further claimed that Phillips grew up around it and that it was a proving ground for young men to demonstrate their strength, adding \"Dogfighting was an accepted and acceptable activity in their world.\" They attended dogfights as youths. Then, after Vick signed his first NFL contract, \"suddenly there's money for these young men to get dogs&nbsp;... get involved in this world\".\n\nJudge Hudson responded that while they might have grown up seeing dogfighting as normal behavior, that did not temper guilt in this case. As he pronounced a sentence which exceeded the guidelines and plea agreement recommendations, he stated: \"You may have thought this was sporting, but it was very callous and cruel&nbsp;... I hope you understand that now.\"{{citation needed|reason=removed dead bare-URL ref with no archived copies|date=February 2020}}\n\nAt the time of the November 30 hearings for Peace and Phillips, Vick was being held at Northern Neck Regional Jail in [[Warsaw, Virginia|Warsaw]], [[Virginia]] where he had turned himself in early while awaiting sentencing on the federal convictions on December 10, 2007.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/falcons/2007-11-19-vick-surrender_N.htm |title= Michael Vick surrenders to federal authorities |accessdate = 2007-11-19 | work=USA Today | first=Gary | last=Mihoces | date=November 20, 2007}}</ref> Vick received a harsher sentence than Peace and Phillips after Hudson concluded that the suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback lied about his direct involvement in killing dogs and about his [[marijuana]] use, which was detected in a drug test, as well as his greater role in the criminal enterprise and lesser cooperation during the earlier investigation.{{citation needed|reason=removed dead bare-URL ref with no archived copies|date=February 2020}} Taylor, who is alleged to have had a greater role in the conspiracy than Peace and Phillips, was also due to be sentenced on December 10, but, like Peace and Phillips, had agreed to testify against Vick at trial before he also accepted a plea agreement.<ref name=autogenerated13>{{cite web|url=http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story%3D137917%26ran%3D7572%26tref%3Dpo |title=Two Vick co-defendants get 18 and 21 months in prison |first=Dave |last=Forster |work=PilotOnline |accessdate=2007-11-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201130332/http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=137917&ran=7572&tref=po |archivedate=2007-12-01 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to federal actions, a parallel state investigation had also been underway since April 2007.

Vick faced two [[felony]] counts under state laws and his trial in Surry County Circuit Court was initially set for April 2, 2008.

It was reported that in January 2006 he paid the $50 fee to renew the Moonlight Road kennel license which is listed in Taylor's name with Surry County. Reamon's uncle, Tommy Reamon, who coached Vick during his high school football career in Newport News, described his nephew as \"a good boy who works for Vick\".

There had already been talk that the government might seek a RICO indictment, based on the specific \"continuing criminal enterprise\" language in the original indictment and in Taylor's plea agreement. A key element of proving racketeering is the existence of a \"criminal enterprise\", and gambling is an indictable offense under RICO. RICO is relatively easy to prove in court, as it focuses on patterns of criminal behavior. If Vick had been charged under RICO, he would have faced penalties of up to 20 years in prison and pay [[treble damages]].\n\n====Other co-defendants also to plead guilty; Vick weighs options====\nBy August 13, Vick's other two co-defendants, Peace and Phillips, had also agreed to also plead guilty under their own plea agreements, they were due in judge Hudson's court in consecutive hearings on August 17.<!--<ref>[http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-03840sy0aug14,0,7380937.story?coll=hr_tab01_layout ]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}</ref> This ref has no archived copies.

Poindexter and Brown said they are continuing to cooperate with federal authorities. Both Brown and Poindexter told news media that they were taken aback by the level of detail in the indictments, especially mention of dogs allegedly being executed by hanging, drowning and electrocution. \"That's revealing to me.

Plea bargains with federal prosecutors would have no official standing in the local case. [[Double jeopardy]] concepts would not apply to state and federal overlapping cases.

Over 50 dogs were seized, in addition to carcasses recovered, and a number of the interstate fight events, all with attendant gambling activities, were allegedly hosted at Vick's Surry County estate.\n\nOn August 17, Surry County Commonwealth's Attorney Gerald Poindexter told [[WVEC-TV]] that the admissions contained in the federal plea agreements filed by Purnell Peace and Quanis Phillips were \"a road map to indictments in Surry County.\" <ref name=autogenerated8 /> The plea agreements implicate all four men, Peace, Phillips, Taylor and Vick in both dog fighting and the killing of dogs. It had been noted in earlier media reports that one of the agreements states that eight dogs were killed jointly by Peace, Phillips and Vick in April 2007 (prior to the April 25 search).\n\nPoindexter told the WVEC news reporter that he's looking at two felony counts: dogfighting and killing of a companion animal. The maximum sentence in Virginia for each charge is five years. \"We believed we had evidence and this is the first time someone's admitted to it. It's sad and outrageous. It's gruesome.\" he added.<ref name=autogenerated8 /> It was also not clear whether any state prison sentence(s) would be allowed run concurrently with any federal time, or would be served consecutively.

It also drew attention to unlawful [[gambling]] and drug activities which authorities claim often accompany dog fighting. Subsequently, Vick and three other principals were convicted of [[federal offense]] conspiracy charges and imprisoned. Vick was suspended by the [[NFL]], was ordered to pay the Atlanta Falcons back a portion of his earnings, and lost endorsement deals worth millions more.

Over 70 dogs, mostly [[pit bull terrier]]s, with some said to be showing signs of injuries, were seized along with physical evidence during several searches of Vick's {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} property by local, state and federal authorities.\n\nIn July 2007, Vick and three other men were indicted on [[federal offense]] and state [[felony]] charges relating to a six-year-long continuing criminal enterprise of an interstate dog fighting ring known as \"Bad Newz Kennels\", based upon a local nickname for [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], Vick's hometown.{{citation needed|reason=removed dead bare-URL ref with no archived copies since 2007|date=February 2020}} Allegations included Vick's direct involvement in dog fighting, high-stakes [[gambling]], and brutal executions of dogs. Public outcry resulted from widespread news media publicity of the details which included hanging, drowning, electrocuting, \"slamming\", and shooting dogs. There were public demonstrations by both Vick supporters and animal rights activists. In consequence, many companies who had been paying for his endorsements withdrew Vick products from retail marketing when he was convicted.\n\nBy August 20, all the defendants on the initial federal charges including Vick had agreed to guilty pleas under [[plea bargain]] agreements, apparently avoiding facing the possibility of additional and more serious charges under the powerful [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]].<ref name=autogenerated15>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?id=2974225 |title=Two more plea deals spell serious trouble for Vick |website=ESPN Sports |date=2007-08-15 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}</ref><ref name=\"ESPNPlea\">{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2983121 |title=Vick faces prison time after agreeing to plead guilty|website=ESPN Sports |accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref> U.S. District Court Judge [[Henry E. Hudson]], who was not bound by sentencing recommendations in plea agreements, had previously advised two of the defendants that the aggravated circumstances involving executing the dogs warranted an upward revision of the sentencing guidelines. The single felony charges carry a maximum sentence of five years.\n\nOn November 30, Peace and Phillips were sentenced by Judge Hudson to 18 and 21 months in [[federal prison]] respectively. The punishments were higher than recommended by federal prosecutors, and included three years of supervised probation following their release from prison. During the sentencing, an attorney for Quanis Phillips argued that his client came from a culture in which [[dog fighting]] was an accepted practice. He further claimed that Phillips grew up around it and that it was a proving ground for young men to demonstrate their strength, adding \"Dogfighting was an accepted and acceptable activity in their world.\" They attended dogfights as youths. Then, after Vick signed his first NFL contract, \"suddenly there's money for these young men to get dogs&nbsp;... get involved in this world\".\n\nJudge Hudson responded that while they might have grown up seeing dogfighting as normal behavior, that did not temper guilt in this case. As he pronounced a sentence which exceeded the guidelines and plea agreement recommendations, he stated: \"You may have thought this was sporting, but it was very callous and cruel&nbsp;...

There had already been talk that the government might seek a RICO indictment, based on the specific \"continuing criminal enterprise\" language in the original indictment and in Taylor's plea agreement. A key element of proving racketeering is the existence of a \"criminal enterprise\", and gambling is an indictable offense under RICO. RICO is relatively easy to prove in court, as it focuses on patterns of criminal behavior. If Vick had been charged under RICO, he would have faced penalties of up to 20 years in prison and pay [[treble damages]].\n\n====Other co-defendants also to plead guilty; Vick weighs options====\nBy August 13, Vick's other two co-defendants, Peace and Phillips, had also agreed to also plead guilty under their own plea agreements, they were due in judge Hudson's court in consecutive hearings on August 17.<!--<ref>[http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-03840sy0aug14,0,7380937.story?coll=hr_tab01_layout ]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}</ref> This ref has no archived copies.

Poindexter and Brown said they are continuing to cooperate with federal authorities. Both Brown and Poindexter told news media that they were taken aback by the level of detail in the indictments, especially mention of dogs allegedly being executed by hanging, drowning and electrocution. \"That's revealing to me.

Plea bargains with federal prosecutors would have no official standing in the local case. [[Double jeopardy]] concepts would not apply to state and federal overlapping cases.

However, no individuals have been named as target(s) to date. Until August 17, there had also been no indication of how many charges might be presented to the grand jury in Surry County. Over 50 dogs were seized, in addition to carcasses recovered, and a number of the interstate fight events, all with attendant gambling activities, were allegedly hosted at Vick's Surry County estate.\n\nOn August 17, Surry County Commonwealth's Attorney Gerald Poindexter told [[WVEC-TV]] that the admissions contained in the federal plea agreements filed by Purnell Peace and Quanis Phillips were \"a road map to indictments in Surry County.\" <ref name=autogenerated8 /> The plea agreements implicate all four men, Peace, Phillips, Taylor and Vick in both dog fighting and the killing of dogs. It had been noted in earlier media reports that one of the agreements states that eight dogs were killed jointly by Peace, Phillips and Vick in April 2007 (prior to the April 25 search).\n\nPoindexter told the WVEC news reporter that he's looking at two felony counts: dogfighting and killing of a companion animal. The maximum sentence in Virginia for each charge is five years. \"We believed we had evidence and this is the first time someone's admitted to it. It's sad and outrageous. It's gruesome.\" he added.<ref name=autogenerated8 /> It was also not clear whether any state prison sentence(s) would be allowed run concurrently with any federal time, or would be served consecutively.
