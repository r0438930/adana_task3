His lifelong friend, Chuck Bernklau, contributed the magical photographic images on the back covers of ''House in the Woods'' and ''Lantern.''  Renowned artist Peter Zokosky painted the cover of ''The Mortal Coil'' album (2014). His girlfriend at the time, Lisa Schell, painted the cover for ''Stained Glass Stories'' (1978). \n\n=== American Museum of Natural History (1992 \u2013 2016) === \nIn 1992, Doncourt became an Education Department volunteer in the early days of the ''Discovery Room'' at AMNH. He was mentored by Ann Prewitt and created puzzles, including the whale mask, and other interactive projects for the hands-on children's space. After that, he was hired to build models for the ''Structures & Culture Moveable Museum,'' and was subsequently offered a position with the Exhibition Department. He helped renovate the ''Hall of Ocean Life'' and built some exhibits for it.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxdioramas.com/american-museum-of-natural-history|title=American Museum of Natural History|website=Box Dioramas.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/students/pop/20030204snaptuesday.html|title=Rescuing the Diorama From the Fate of the Dodo|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref> Doncourt was also part of the team that built the 28-foot-long [[Quetzalcoatlus]] for the show ''Pterosaurs: Flight in the Age of Dinosaurs'' in 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Stapinski|first=Helene|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/science/behind-the-scenes-at-pterosaurs-flight-in-the-age-of-dinosaurs.html|title=Fleshing Out the Bones|date=2014-03-31|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> He was a Preparator, or Exhibitions Artist until he retired as Senior Principal Preparator in 2016.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nWhile with the AMNH, Doncourt also worked on [[diorama]]<nowiki/>s.

He became part of a team that was sent to various locations to set up shows that he had worked on. He also served as a consultant with other museums on diorama restoration, as in 2018, when he helped restore the ''Hall of Fishes'' in the [[Vanderbilt Museum]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tbrnewsmedia.com/tag/thomas-doncourt/|title=Thomas Doncourt {{!}} TBR News Media|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\n== Cover Art for the ''Kyoto Visitor\u2019s Guide''== \nBetween the years 2000 and 2017, Doncourt traveled to Japan four times. He was particularly interested in visiting Buddhist temples and gardens in [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. During his final trip to Japan shortly after his diagnosis, Doncourt visited Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d, a Buddhist temple of the Tendai sect in the Higashiyama district of Kyoto, several times. He produced a detailed drawing in the Hall of the Lotus King, where1,001 statues and their guardians stand. That drawing became the basis for his final painting, a large canvas portraying multiple rows of golden Kannon with a guardian statue in the foreground. The specific guardian Doncourt chose to focus on is named Sakara Ryu-o (literally the Sakara King of Dragons). He relied on memory alone to recreate the colors.  In September 2019, a kindred spirit, Lisa Schell, and her friend, an editor from the ''Kyoto Visitor\u2019s Guide'', expressed interest in using Doncourt\u2019s painting for the cover of an upcoming issue, with an accompanying article about 'the immortal force of compassion and mercy' that inspired him at Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d. The magazine offered Doncourt's estate an opportunity to showcase his artwork, and his lyrics about the nearby Philosopher\u2019s Path.<ref name=\":2\" /> The issue was published in February 2020.  \n \n== Discography == \n* 1978: Cathedral - ''Stained Glass Stories'', Delta Records<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/de/artist/1441714-Cathedral-3|title=Cathedral (3)|website=Discogs|language=de|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2002: Thomas Doncourt - ''Fauve,'' self released<ref>{{Citation|title=Fauve by Thomas Doncourt|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/thomas_doncourt/fauve/|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2007: Cathedral - ''The Bridge'', self released<ref name=\":8\" /> \n* 2009: FauveMuseum - ''Blacklight,'' self released<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/FauveMuseum-Blacklight/release/5544720|title=FauveMuseum - Blacklight|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2014: Tom Doncourt - ''The Mortal Coil,'' self released<ref name=\":6\" /> \n* 2015: Tom Doncourt - ''The Moon Will Rise,'' self released<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/de/artist/1441713-Tom-Doncourt|title=Tom Doncourt|website=Discogs|language=de|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2017: Tom Doncourt - ''House in the Woods,'' self released<ref name=\":7\" /> \n* 2018: Tom Doncourt & Nadia Ratsimandresy - ''Ratsimandresy & Doncourt, Volume 1'', self released<ref>{{Citation|title=\u266b Ratsimandresy & Doncourt, Vol. 1 - Tom Doncourt.

His lifelong friend, Chuck Bernklau, contributed the magical photographic images on the back covers of ''House in the Woods'' and ''Lantern.''  Renowned artist Peter Zokosky painted the cover of ''The Mortal Coil'' album (2014). His girlfriend at the time, Lisa Schell, painted the cover for ''Stained Glass Stories'' (1978). \n\n=== American Museum of Natural History (1992 \u2013 2016) === \nIn 1992, Doncourt became an Education Department volunteer in the early days of the ''Discovery Room'' at AMNH. He was mentored by Ann Prewitt and created puzzles, including the whale mask, and other interactive projects for the hands-on children's space. After that, he was hired to build models for the ''Structures & Culture Moveable Museum,'' and was subsequently offered a position with the Exhibition Department. He helped renovate the ''Hall of Ocean Life'' and built some exhibits for it.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxdioramas.com/american-museum-of-natural-history|title=American Museum of Natural History|website=Box Dioramas.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/students/pop/20030204snaptuesday.html|title=Rescuing the Diorama From the Fate of the Dodo|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref> Doncourt was also part of the team that built the 28-foot-long [[Quetzalcoatlus]] for the show ''Pterosaurs: Flight in the Age of Dinosaurs'' in 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Stapinski|first=Helene|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/science/behind-the-scenes-at-pterosaurs-flight-in-the-age-of-dinosaurs.html|title=Fleshing Out the Bones|date=2014-03-31|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> He was a Preparator, or Exhibitions Artist until he retired as Senior Principal Preparator in 2016.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nWhile with the AMNH, Doncourt also worked on [[diorama]]<nowiki/>s.

He became part of a team that was sent to various locations to set up shows that he had worked on. He also served as a consultant with other museums on diorama restoration, as in 2018, when he helped restore the ''Hall of Fishes'' in the [[Vanderbilt Museum]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tbrnewsmedia.com/tag/thomas-doncourt/|title=Thomas Doncourt {{!}} TBR News Media|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\n== Cover Art for the ''Kyoto Visitor\u2019s Guide''== \nBetween the years 2000 and 2017, Doncourt traveled to Japan four times. He was particularly interested in visiting Buddhist temples and gardens in [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. During his final trip to Japan shortly after his diagnosis, Doncourt visited Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d, a Buddhist temple of the Tendai sect in the Higashiyama district of Kyoto, several times. He produced a detailed drawing in the Hall of the Lotus King, where1,001 statues and their guardians stand. That drawing became the basis for his final painting, a large canvas portraying multiple rows of golden Kannon with a guardian statue in the foreground. The specific guardian Doncourt chose to focus on is named Sakara Ryu-o (literally the Sakara King of Dragons). He relied on memory alone to recreate the colors.  In September 2019, a kindred spirit, Lisa Schell, and her friend, an editor from the ''Kyoto Visitor\u2019s Guide'', expressed interest in using Doncourt\u2019s painting for the cover of an upcoming issue, with an accompanying article about 'the immortal force of compassion and mercy' that inspired him at Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d. The magazine offered Doncourt's estate an opportunity to showcase his artwork, and his lyrics about the nearby Philosopher\u2019s Path.<ref name=\":2\" /> The issue was published in February 2020.  \n \n== Discography == \n* 1978: Cathedral - ''Stained Glass Stories'', Delta Records<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/de/artist/1441714-Cathedral-3|title=Cathedral (3)|website=Discogs|language=de|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2002: Thomas Doncourt - ''Fauve,'' self released<ref>{{Citation|title=Fauve by Thomas Doncourt|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/thomas_doncourt/fauve/|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2007: Cathedral - ''The Bridge'', self released<ref name=\":8\" /> \n* 2009: FauveMuseum - ''Blacklight,'' self released<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/FauveMuseum-Blacklight/release/5544720|title=FauveMuseum - Blacklight|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2014: Tom Doncourt - ''The Mortal Coil,'' self released<ref name=\":6\" /> \n* 2015: Tom Doncourt - ''The Moon Will Rise,'' self released<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/de/artist/1441713-Tom-Doncourt|title=Tom Doncourt|website=Discogs|language=de|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2017: Tom Doncourt - ''House in the Woods,'' self released<ref name=\":7\" /> \n* 2018: Tom Doncourt & Nadia Ratsimandresy - ''Ratsimandresy & Doncourt, Volume 1'', self released<ref>{{Citation|title=\u266b Ratsimandresy & Doncourt, Vol. 1 - Tom Doncourt.
