{"title_page": "Music of the Bahamas", "text_new": "{{See also|Music of The Bahamas (docu-musical)}}\n{{Short description|music}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{Music of the Anglophone Caribbean}}\n\nThe '''music of the Bahamas''' is associated primarily with [[Junkanoo]], a celebration which occurs on [[Boxing Day]] and again on [[New Year's Day]]. [[Parade]]s and other celebrations mark the ceremony.  Groups like [[The Baha Men]], [[Ronnie Butler]] and [[Kirkland Bodie]] have gained massive popularity in Japan, the United States and other places. Other popular Bahamian artists include [[Stileet]] and [[Stevie S]].\n\n== Calypso ==\n[[Calypso music|Calypso]] is a style of Afro-Caribbean music which originated in [[Trinidad and Tobago]].  This form of music has spread through many parts of the Caribbean, including [[The Bahamas]].\n\n== Soca ==\n[[Soca music|Soca]] is a form of dance music which originated from many calypso music in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. It originally combined the melodic lilting sound of calypso with insistent percussion (which is often electronic in recent music) and local chutney music. Soca music has evolved in the last 20 years primarily by musicians from various Anglophone Caribbean countries including Trinidad, Guyana, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Barbados, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda, United States Virgin Islands, [[The Bahamas]], Dominica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Jamaica and Belize.\n\n== Junkanoo ==\n[[File:Junkanoo.jpg|thumb|left|Junkanoo celebration in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]]]\nThe word ''Junkanoo'' is said to be derived from a [[Ghana]]ian leader, [[John Connu]], or from the [[Qujo]] supreme deity ([[Canno]]) and ancestral spirits ([[jannanin]]).  The junkanoo was formerly practiced in [[North Carolina]] and remnants still exist in [[Belize]]. It is most well known, though, from [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] and [[Freeport, Bahamas|Freeport]]. Since the 1950s the influence of [[culture of the United States|American culture]] has increased, mainly through TV and radio broadcasts from [[Florida]] stations, and other [[Caribbean]] styles have made inroads: [[calypso music|calypso]], [[reggae]] and [[Soca music|soca]], from [[Jamaica]], [[Cuba]], [[Trinidad]], and other islands. [[Tourism]] has also had an impact, bringing in Japanese, European and North Americans with their attendant forms of cultural expression. In this milieu more traditional Bahamas performers such as [[Joseph Spence (musician)|Joseph Spence]], have still enjoyed successful careers playing junkanoo, Christian [[hymn]]s and the ''[[ant'em]]s'' of the local [[sea sponge|sponge]] fishermen, which include \"Sloop John B\", later made famous by [[The Beach Boys]].\n\nJunkane.\n\n[[File:Junkanoo2.jpg|thumb|right|Junkanoo celebration in Nassau in 2003]]\n\nIn 1973, the year the Bahamas achieved independence from the United Kingdom, black professionals of the middle and upper classes began to dominate junkanoo celebrations.  Costuming and competitions became more complex and commonplace, and soon became a tourist draw.\n\nAside from being a type of drum, [[goombay]] is also a [[percussion music]] made famous by [[Alphonso 'Blind Blake' Higgs]], who played to tourists arriving at [[Nassau International Airport]] for several years.  [[Rake-and-scrape]] music is a unique type of instrumental music made by bending a saw and scraping with a small object, most typically a [[screwdriver]]; it is used to accompany dances derived from European forms like [[polka]] and [[waltz]].  Rake-and-scrape's popularity has been declining in recent years, but performers like [[Lassie Do and the Boys]] continue to keep the tradition alive.  Christian [[rhyming spiritual]]s and the ''[[ant'em]]s'' of [[sponge fishing|sponge fishermen]] are now mostly dead traditions, decimated by the arrival of pop music, a 1930s sponge blight and other causes.\n\n[[E. Clement Bethel]]'s master's thesis on traditional Bahamian music was adapted for the stage by his daughter, [[Nicolette Bethel]] and [[Philip A. Burrows]].  ''[[Music of The Bahamas]]'' was first performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 1991, and was revived in 2002 for fresh Bahamian audiences.  A recording of that show is available for sale from [[Ringplay Productions]]. hey guys its kim kardashian West\n\n==Rake and scrape== \n{{Main|Rake-and-scrape}}\n[[Rake and scrape Music|Rake and scrape]] music is played traditionally with [[Concertinas]], [[Goombay drums]], and a [[Handsaw]]. Rake and scrape is believed to have originated on the island of Cat Island but evidence suggest that it was emerging in many places simultaneously. The earliest reference to usage of the accordion by Bahamians is in 1886 in an Article in the Nassau Guardian. The term rake and scrape became the norm in 1969 by Charles Carter although he claims the people of Cat Island were already calling it that when he visited the Island.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=bp94R0EiBn4C&pg=PA135&lpg=PA135&dq=nassau+guardian+concertinas+1886#v=onepage&q=nassau%20guardian%20concertinas%201886&f=false | title=Funky Nassau: Roots, Routes, and Representation in Bahamian Popular Music| isbn=9780520265684| last1=Rommen| first1=Timothy| date=19 May 2011}}</ref><ref>http://www.bahamasentertainers.com/Paper/rkeNscr.html</ref>\n\n==Organology of instruments==\n\nMembranophones: The [[Goombay]] drum is main rhythmic component in rake-n-scrape.
