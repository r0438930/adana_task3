As a player, he represented [[England national football team|the England national team]] and captained that side, but he is best known for his time as [[England national football team manager|England manager]] from 1963 to 1974, which included guiding them to victory in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]]. Knighted in 1967 in recognition of the World Cup win, Ramsey also managed his country to third place in the [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968 European Championship]] and the quarter-finals of the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] and the [[UEFA Euro 1972|1972 European Championship]] respectively. As a player, Ramsey was a [[defender (association football)|defender]] and a member of England's [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] squad.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-Ernest-Ramsey|title=Sir Alfred Ernest Ramsey: British soccer player and manager |website=Britannica|date=24 April 2020|access-date=28 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nRamsey was born and raised in a quiet [[Essex]] village. He showed sporting promise from an early age and, after serving in the British Army during the [[World War II|Second World War]], embarked on a football career, primarily as a [[right-back]]. He was considered a rather slow but accomplished player with a tremendous grasp of the tactical side of the game. Nicknamed \"The General\", he played for England 32 times between 1948 and 1953, he captaining the side three times, scoring three times and appearing in the 1950 World Cup. He played his club football for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and was part of the Tottenham side that won the [[List of English football champions|English League championship]] in the [[1950\u201351 Football League|1950\u201351 season]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Asif |last=Burhan|url=https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/s/modest-beginnings-sir-alf-ramsey|title=The improbable success of Alf Ramsey|website=morningstaronline|date=22 January 2020|access-date=28 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nRamsey retired from playing aged 35 to become the manager of [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], then in the [[English football league system|third tier of English football]]. Ipswich rose through the divisions over the next six years, winning the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] in [[1956\u201357 Football League|1956\u201357]] and the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in [[1960\u201361 Football League|1960\u201361]]. In the [[1961\u201362 Football League|1961\u201362 season]], Ipswich's first ever campaign in the top division, Ramsey's team defied expectations to become champions of England. Ramsey took charge of the England team a year later. In a distinct break with common practice of the day, he used a narrow formation that led to his England side being dubbed \"The Wingless Wonders\". England's World Cup victory at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] in 1966 made Ramsey a national hero, though he had his critics, both at the time and since. He lost the England job acrimoniously, following the team's failure to qualify for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]].\n\nAfter managing England, Ramsey briefly held football-related roles at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], before retiring in 1979\u201380. He led a somewhat reclusive life in [[Ipswich]] over the next two decades and died in 1999, aged 79. A statue of Ramsey was dedicated at the reconstructed [[Wembley Stadium]] in 2009, and various honours have been afforded to him in Ipswich. He is the first person to have been inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] twice: an inaugural inductee in 2002, in recognition of his achievements as a manager and admitted again in 2010 for his achievements as a player. He remains widely regarded as one of British football's all-time great managers.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Dagenham===\n[[File:Dagenham village.jpg|thumb|The village green in [[Dagenham]], Ramsey's birthplace and childhood home (2007)]]\nAlfred Ernest Ramsey was born on 22 January 1920 at 6 Parrish Cottages, Halbutt Street in [[Dagenham]], which was then an [[agriculture|agrarian]] village in Essex, about {{convert|10|mi}} east of central London.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} He was the third of five children, four boys and a girl, born to Herbert Ramsey, a manual labourer who worked a [[smallholding]], kept pigs and drove a horse-drawn [[dustcart]], and his wife Florence (''n\u00e9e'' Bixby). Parrish Cottages lacked hot running water and electricity, and the only toilet was outside. Such conditions were typical of Dagenham during this period, although Ramsey's street gradually became something of an anachronism as he grew up. From 1921, [[London County Council]] transformed the area into the [[Becontree]] estate, a vast urban community that by 1934 was home to 120,000 people and the [[Ford Dagenham]] automobile factory. Parrish Cottages remained largely untouched: electricity was not installed until the 1950s, and even then only with the reluctant approval of Ramsey's mother, who, according to a neighbour, was frightened of it.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} In the recollection of a childhood contemporary, Phil Cairns, the Ramsey house was \"little more than a wooden hut\".{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}}\n\nThe young Alf Ramsey was described by his friend Fred Tibble as \"a very quiet boy who really loved sport\".{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} In his 1952 autobiography ''Talking Football'', Ramsey described \"liv[ing] for the open air from the moment I could toddle\",{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=12}} spending hours each day in the meadow behind the family cottage, playing ball games with his brothers. He learned skills such as ball control, kicking and heading with a [[tennis ball]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} From the age of five, Ramsey attended Becontree Heath School, which had a roll of about 200 pupils aged from four to fourteen. He and his brothers had to walk two hours from their house to get there, and passed a ball between each other on the way to break the monotony. Ramsey was not especially popular socially, nor particularly diligent as a student, but he excelled in sports. In addition to football, he played [[cricket]] to a high standard and represented the school in the [[high jump]], the [[long jump]], and both the [[100-yard dash|100-yard]] and 200-yard dash. Despite his diminutive stature, he also enjoyed [[boxing]] until an incident when he was 10 years old, when a much larger opponent\u2014\"as wide as I was tall\" in Ramsey's recollection\u2014gave him a severe beating in a school tournament.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} Ramsey carried a noticeable scar above his mouth, a memento of this fight, for the rest of his life.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}}\n\n\"He was very withdrawn, almost surly\", Cairns recalled, \"but he became animated on the football field\".{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} Ramsey was selected to play for Becontree Heath School when he was only seven years old, playing at [[Inside forward|inside-left]] alongside boys as old as fourteen; his nine-year-old brother Len was at inside-right. Alf's selection for the school team prompted the purchase of his first pair of football boots. Two years later, aged nine, he became captain of the school team. By this point he had switched to playing at [[Defender (association football)|centre-half]]\u2014the key position of the [[WM formation|\"WM\" formation]] then favoured in British football, between the full-backs and the forwards.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} His main strength was generally perceived to be his extremely accurate passing; his chief shortcoming was a lack of pace, for which Ramsey compensated by learning to read the game and position himself well.{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=21\u201325}} Ramsey played for teams representing the schools of Dagenham and Essex County respectively, and trialled unsuccessfully for the London schools team while at Becontree.{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=21\u201325}} While he was at school, his brother Albert took him to see his first [[English Football League|Football League]] match, watching their favourite team, [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], play against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=14}} This was the only senior match Alf would attend before playing in them himself.{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=26\u201328}} He later wrote that his main recollection of it was the performance of one of the Arsenal forwards, the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] international [[Alex James (footballer)|Alex James]].{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=14}}\n\nOn leaving school in 1934, the 14-year-old Ramsey tried to get a job at the Ford plant, then told his family he intended to become a [[greengrocer]]. To that end he became an apprentice at a local branch of the [[Co-op Food|Co-op]], delivering groceries on a bicycle. The manual work helped to bulk up Ramsey's physique,{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=25\u201326}} but he found himself unable to play organised football because he had to work on Saturday afternoons. After a two-year hiatus, he returned to the game when he joined Five Elms, a newly formed amateur club whose matches on Thursdays fitted with his work schedule.{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=14}} About a year later, during the 1937\u201338 season, Ramsey was spotted by [[Ned Liddell]], a [[Scout (association football)|scout]] from [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]],{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=28\u201330}} then a well-established top-flight club.<ref name=\"rssf\">{{cite web|title=English Clubs Divisional Movements 1888\u20132005|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engall.html|publisher=[[RSSSF]]|accessdate=2 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805092856/http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engall.html|archive-date=5 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Liddell offered a contract as an amateur. Rather than signing on the spot, Ramsey asked to take the forms home to examine first; he signed them that night and sent them to Portsmouth by post.{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=15}} Much to Ramsey's disappointment, Portsmouth did not contact him again. He spent the next two years working at the Co-op while playing cricket in the summer and football in the winter.{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|p=27}}\n\n===Second World War===\n\n====Military service====\n[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-45 H4953A.jpg|thumb|A [[Universal Carrier]] Mk I of Ramsey's regiment, with [[Bren light machine gun|Bren gun]] mounted for [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] use (1940)|alt=An open-topped military vehicle containing soldiers, who point a mortar and a machine gun upwards.]]\nAfter the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939, Ramsey was conscripted into the [[British Army]] on 24 June 1940.{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=16}} He was assigned to the [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]] and underwent his initial training in [[Truro]], where he and other recruits were housed in a hotel commandeered by the army. Ramsey found the experience a thrilling adventure.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|p=28}} \"Until I travelled to [[Cornwall]], the longest journey I had undertaken was a trip to [[Brighton]] by train\", he recalled. \"It was the first time I had ever been into a hotel! Even with us sleeping twelve to a room, on straw mattresses, could not end for me the awe of living in a swagger hotel.\"{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=17}} \"That set the tone for Alf's war\", [[Leo McKinstry]] suggests in his 2010 biography; attached to his regiment's 6th Battalion, Ramsey spent the entire war in Britain on home defence duties.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=28\u201329}} The training was still physically demanding though, and, in Ramsey's words, made him \"a fitter young fellow than when I reported for duty as a grocery apprentice from Dagenham.\"{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=28\u201329}}\n\nWriting in 1952, Ramsey would call joining the army \"one of the greatest things which ever happened to me\", adding \"I learnt, in a few weeks, more about life in general that I had picked up in years at home.\"{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=17}} Military life taught Ramsey about discipline and leadership, and improved his social skills: \"I have never been very good at mixing with people but you have to in the army or else you are in trouble\", the journalist Nigel Clarke recalled him saying.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=28\u201329}} Ramsey rose to be a [[company quartermaster sergeant]] in an [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] unit.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n====Wartime football====\nMilitary service also allowed Ramsey to play football more regularly, and at a higher standard than before.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=30\u201331}} In late 1940 he was posted to [[St Austell]], on the south coast of Cornwall, where he manned beach defences and became captain of the battalion football team, playing at centre-half or [[centre-forward]] as circumstances dictated. After three years in various seaside postings, Ramsey was, in 1943, moved to [[Barton Stacey]] in [[Hampshire]], where he came under the command of a Colonel Fletcher, himself an accomplished footballer. Ramsey's battalion team by this time featured players from a number of Football League clubs, including the [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] forward [[Len Townsend]] and Arsenal's [[Cyril Hodges]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=30\u201331}} Ramsey played at centre-half for his battalion team as [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] defeated them 10\u20133 at [[The Dell, Southampton|the Dell]] in a pre-season [[Exhibition game|friendly]] on 21 August 1943, and a week later played again as the battalion took on Southampton's [[reserve team]]. The soldiers won the second match 4\u20131.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n[[File:Oak Road End at Kenilworth Road, 1980.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kenilworth Road]], [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]'s ground, where Ramsey first played for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the wartime [[Football League North and South|Football League South]] (1980)|alt=A football match in progress at a modest, traditional British football ground.]]\nOn 8 October 1943, Colonel Fletcher called Ramsey to his office to inform him that Southampton needed a centre-half for their [[Glossary of association football terms#F|first-team]] match [[Road (sports)|away]] to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] the next day, and had enquired about the sergeant's availability. The 23-year-old Ramsey was cautious, saying he lacked experience, but said he would \"give it a try\" when the colonel suggested that playing might set him on the way to a [[Professionalism in association football|professional football career]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=30\u201331}} The next day, while en route to [[Luton]] by train, Ramsey signed for Southampton as an amateur,{{sfn|Chalk|Holley|Bull|2013|pp=440\u2013441}} making his debut for the club at Luton's [[Kenilworth Road]] ground. Ramsey gave away a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] late in the game with Southampton 2\u20131 ahead, allowing Luton to equalise, but Southampton managed to win 3\u20132.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=33\u201334}} He played in three more matches for the team during the 1943\u201344 season before his battalion's posting to [[County Durham]] forced his absence. After his unit returned to the south coast at the start of the 1944\u201345 season, Ramsey played in a trial match at Southampton, and performed well enough that the club offered a professional contract on wages of \u00a32 per match. Ramsey was still uncertain about pursuing a football career; he signed the contract only after Southampton assured him that he could leave at the end of the season if he wished.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nRamsey was injured during the 1944\u201345 pre-season, ironically while playing against Southampton for his battalion team, so he did not make his first appearance as a professional until December. During the match, against Arsenal at [[White Hart Lane]],{{#tag:ref|Arsenal played at White Hart Lane during the war because [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] was bombed in [[the Blitz]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=34\u201335}}|group=\"n\"|name=\"highburybombed\"}} Ramsey played centre-half opposite the formidable Arsenal centre-forward [[Ted Drake]] and according to McKinstry \"had the best game of his career to date.\"{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=34\u201335}} Drake scored twice, but Ramsey still felt that he had proven his ability to play league football.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=34\u201335}} On 3 March 1945, against Luton Town at the Dell, Ramsey was switched to inside-left because of injuries elsewhere in the team; he scored four goals in a 12\u20133 Southampton win.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=34\u201335}}{{sfn|Chalk|Holley|1987|p=108}} The ''[[Southern Daily Echo]]'' reported \"he can certainly hammer a ball.\"{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=34\u201335}} Ramsey finished the season having made 11 [[Football League North and South|League South]] appearances.{{sfn|Chalk|Holley|1987|p=108}}\n\nRamsey remained in the army during [[1945\u201346 in English football|1945\u201346, the first football season after the war]]. Starting as a centre-forward, he scored two goals in each of Southampton's opening two games, then a [[Hat-trick (association football)|hat-trick]] in a 6\u20132 victory at [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] on 6 October 1945.{{sfn|Chalk|Holley|1987|p=109}} He played in 13 League South matches before military commitments again intervened\u2014in December 1945 he was deployed to [[Mandatory Palestine]], where he accepted an invitation to captain a football team representing the British garrison. This side included [[Arthur Rowley]], who later scored hundreds of goals for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]], and the future Scotland international forward [[Jimmy Mason (footballer, born 1919)|Jimmy Mason]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=35\u201336}} Ramsey returned to England in June 1946 to find himself entertaining overtures from both the new Southampton manager [[Bill Dodgin Sr.|Bill Dodgin]] and the Dagenham Co-op, the latter of which offered Ramsey his pre-war job back. Ramsey initially turned Southampton down, but accepted after the club offered better terms: \u00a36 per week during the summer, \u00a37 in winter and \u00a38 if he was selected for the league team. He was formally [[Military discharge|discharged]] from the army soon after.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=36\u201338}}\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Southampton===\n\nThe regular Football League restarted in time for the [[1946\u201347 Football League|1946\u201347 season]].

McKinstry calls this \"exactly the right place for Alf\", citing Ramsey's tactical knowledge and fine passing.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|p=38}} A close master-and-pupil relationship developed between Ramsey and Cann, who had played at full-back for [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. During training sessions, the two had long discussions about tactics and individual techniques. {{nobreak|\"[Alf]}} wanted to learn about the game from top to bottom\", Cann recalled; \"I have never known anyone with the same quickness of learning as Alf Ramsey.

As natural wingers were not always known for their defensive qualities, Ramsey started dropping them in favour of attacking midfielders who could also drop back into defensive roles. This system proved revolutionary as it often baffled opposing full-backs, who would naturally expect to see a winger coming down the flank at them once the ball was kicked off: instead, the attacking midfielders and strikers were taking the ball through the middle of the defence and scoring. This style of play proved successful at Ipswich, but really showed its worth when England travelled to Spain to play a friendly with them before the World Cup. As [[Bobby Charlton]] remarked, \"The Spanish full-backs were just looking at each other while we were going in droves through the middle\". To win in Spain, who were the reigning European Champions, was rare for an English team and was evidence that Ramsey's techniques were working.<ref name=\"Orejan2011\">{{cite book|author=Jaime Orejan|title=Football/Soccer: History and Tactics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0l2T7tLSiEC&pg=PA112|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8566-6|page=112| accessdate = 21 March 2019}}</ref>\n<!--\nA firm but fair manager, Ramsey was often regarded as difficult by the press. He ran a strict regime with his players and made sure that no-one felt that they enjoyed special status, star player or not. In May 1964, after a number of players failed to show up for a meeting in a hotel about a forthcoming tour, amongst them Bobby Moore, [[Jimmy Greaves]] and [[Bobby Charlton]], they eventually returned to their rooms to discover their passports left on their beds. His strict regime didn't suit everyone but the players with real talent and respect for the game responded well to them and had great respect for Ramsey. Very few of those who played for Ramsey spoke ill of him. In the preparations for the 1966 World Cup, Ramsey made sure that no player was confident of a place in the final 22, which resulted in players performing at their highest level. His decision to appoint a young Bobby Moore as captain also showed Ramsey's ability to see great potential in young players. Another one of his abilities was as a master tactician: a quality that he had first shown with his reading of the game as a player. When it came to tactics, Ramsey had revolutionary ideas.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}-->\n\nRamsey earned the respect of his players. He strongly supported [[Nobby Stiles]] when the FA leaned on Ramsey to drop Stiles from the 1966 World Cup quarter-final following a tackle on Frenchman [[Jacques Simon (footballer)|Jacques Simon]] in the previous game.{{sfn|Lawton|2003|pp=168\u2013170}}  After the final, at the banquet, with the players in one room and their wives forced to sit in an adjoining room, he excused his players early from the banquet to allow the players to join their wives after nearly four weeks apart.{{sfn|Lawton|2003|p=208}} In his manner with the players, he was \"usually equable\", but when his 1978 Birmingham City team produced a poor defensive display, \"he blew his top\"; the next game was a \"historic victory\".<ref name=\"BrumMail\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nRamsey was very sensitive about his personal background. He strove to mask his [[working-class]] Essex origins and to present himself as erudite and worldly, going so far as to adopt an accent that the journalist [[Brian Glanville]] called \"sergeant-major posh\".{{sfn|Dickinson|2014|p=71}} A widely held perception that Ramsey's accent had become more upper-class during his time as England manager fuelled speculation that he had received [[elocution]] lessons, and prompted constant joking from members of the England team who came from similar Essex or East London backgrounds, such as Bobby Moore and Jimmy Greaves.{{sfn|Dickinson|2014|p=71}} [[Rodney Marsh]], a forward from the East End who played in Ramsey's England team from 1971 to 1973, later said:\n<blockquote>\nAlf tended to speak in a very poncey plum-in-the-mouth way.

Knighted in 1967 in recognition of the World Cup win, Ramsey also managed his country to third place in the [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968 European Championship]] and the quarter-finals of the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] and the [[UEFA Euro 1972|1972 European Championship]] respectively.

He showed sporting promise from an early age and, after serving in the British Army during the [[World War II|Second World War]], embarked on a football career, primarily as a [[right-back]]. He was considered a rather slow but accomplished player with a tremendous grasp of the tactical side of the game. Nicknamed \"The General\", he played for England 32 times between 1948 and 1953, he captaining the side three times, scoring three times and appearing in the 1950 World Cup. He played his club football for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and was part of the Tottenham side that won the [[List of English football champions|English League championship]] in the [[1950\u201351 Football League|1950\u201351 season]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Asif |last=Burhan|url=https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/s/modest-beginnings-sir-alf-ramsey|title=The improbable success of Alf Ramsey|website=morningstaronline|date=22 January 2020|access-date=28 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nRamsey retired from playing aged 35 to become the manager of [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], then in the [[English football league system|third tier of English football]]. Ipswich rose through the divisions over the next six years, winning the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] in [[1956\u201357 Football League|1956\u201357]] and the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in [[1960\u201361 Football League|1960\u201361]]. In the [[1961\u201362 Football League|1961\u201362 season]], Ipswich's first ever campaign in the top division, Ramsey's team defied expectations to become champions of England. Ramsey took charge of the England team a year later. In a distinct break with common practice of the day, he used a narrow formation that led to his England side being dubbed \"The Wingless Wonders\". England's World Cup victory at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] in 1966 made Ramsey a national hero, though he had his critics, both at the time and since. He lost the England job acrimoniously, following the team's failure to qualify for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]].\n\nAfter managing England, Ramsey briefly held football-related roles at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], before retiring in 1979\u201380. He led a somewhat reclusive life in [[Ipswich]] over the next two decades and died in 1999, aged 79. A statue of Ramsey was dedicated at the reconstructed [[Wembley Stadium]] in 2009, and various honours have been afforded to him in Ipswich. He is the first person to have been inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] twice: an inaugural inductee in 2002, in recognition of his achievements as a manager and admitted again in 2010 for his achievements as a player. He remains widely regarded as one of British football's all-time great managers.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Dagenham===\n[[File:Dagenham village.jpg|thumb|The village green in [[Dagenham]], Ramsey's birthplace and childhood home (2007)]]\nAlfred Ernest Ramsey was born on 22 January 1920 at 6 Parrish Cottages, Halbutt Street in [[Dagenham]], which was then an [[agriculture|agrarian]] village in Essex, about {{convert|10|mi}} east of central London.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} He was the third of five children, four boys and a girl, born to Herbert Ramsey, a manual labourer who worked a [[smallholding]], kept pigs and drove a horse-drawn [[dustcart]], and his wife Florence (''n\u00e9e'' Bixby). Parrish Cottages lacked hot running water and electricity, and the only toilet was outside. Such conditions were typical of Dagenham during this period, although Ramsey's street gradually became something of an anachronism as he grew up. From 1921, [[London County Council]] transformed the area into the [[Becontree]] estate, a vast urban community that by 1934 was home to 120,000 people and the [[Ford Dagenham]] automobile factory. Parrish Cottages remained largely untouched: electricity was not installed until the 1950s, and even then only with the reluctant approval of Ramsey's mother, who, according to a neighbour, was frightened of it.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} In the recollection of a childhood contemporary, Phil Cairns, the Ramsey house was \"little more than a wooden hut\".{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}}\n\nThe young Alf Ramsey was described by his friend Fred Tibble as \"a very quiet boy who really loved sport\".{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} In his 1952 autobiography ''Talking Football'', Ramsey described \"liv[ing] for the open air from the moment I could toddle\",{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=12}} spending hours each day in the meadow behind the family cottage, playing ball games with his brothers. He learned skills such as ball control, kicking and heading with a [[tennis ball]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} From the age of five, Ramsey attended Becontree Heath School, which had a roll of about 200 pupils aged from four to fourteen. He and his brothers had to walk two hours from their house to get there, and passed a ball between each other on the way to break the monotony. Ramsey was not especially popular socially, nor particularly diligent as a student, but he excelled in sports. In addition to football, he played [[cricket]] to a high standard and represented the school in the [[high jump]], the [[long jump]], and both the [[100-yard dash|100-yard]] and 200-yard dash. Despite his diminutive stature, he also enjoyed [[boxing]] until an incident when he was 10 years old, when a much larger opponent\u2014\"as wide as I was tall\" in Ramsey's recollection\u2014gave him a severe beating in a school tournament.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} Ramsey carried a noticeable scar above his mouth, a memento of this fight, for the rest of his life.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}}\n\n\"He was very withdrawn, almost surly\", Cairns recalled, \"but he became animated on the football field\".{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} Ramsey was selected to play for Becontree Heath School when he was only seven years old, playing at [[Inside forward|inside-left]] alongside boys as old as fourteen; his nine-year-old brother Len was at inside-right. Alf's selection for the school team prompted the purchase of his first pair of football boots. Two years later, aged nine, he became captain of the school team. By this point he had switched to playing at [[Defender (association football)|centre-half]]\u2014the key position of the [[WM formation|\"WM\" formation]] then favoured in British football, between the full-backs and the forwards.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} His main strength was generally perceived to be his extremely accurate passing; his chief shortcoming was a lack of pace, for which Ramsey compensated by learning to read the game and position himself well.{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=21\u201325}} Ramsey played for teams representing the schools of Dagenham and Essex County respectively, and trialled unsuccessfully for the London schools team while at Becontree.{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=21\u201325}} While he was at school, his brother Albert took him to see his first [[English Football League|Football League]] match, watching their favourite team, [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], play against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=14}} This was the only senior match Alf would attend before playing in them himself.{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=26\u201328}} He later wrote that his main recollection of it was the performance of one of the Arsenal forwards, the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] international [[Alex James (footballer)|Alex James]].{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=14}}\n\nOn leaving school in 1934, the 14-year-old Ramsey tried to get a job at the Ford plant, then told his family he intended to become a [[greengrocer]]. To that end he became an apprentice at a local branch of the [[Co-op Food|Co-op]], delivering groceries on a bicycle. The manual work helped to bulk up Ramsey's physique,{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=25\u201326}} but he found himself unable to play organised football because he had to work on Saturday afternoons. After a two-year hiatus, he returned to the game when he joined Five Elms, a newly formed amateur club whose matches on Thursdays fitted with his work schedule.{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=14}} About a year later, during the 1937\u201338 season, Ramsey was spotted by [[Ned Liddell]], a [[Scout (association football)|scout]] from [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]],{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=28\u201330}} then a well-established top-flight club.<ref name=\"rssf\">{{cite web|title=English Clubs Divisional Movements 1888\u20132005|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engall.html|publisher=[[RSSSF]]|accessdate=2 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805092856/http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engall.html|archive-date=5 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Liddell offered a contract as an amateur. Rather than signing on the spot, Ramsey asked to take the forms home to examine first; he signed them that night and sent them to Portsmouth by post.{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=15}} Much to Ramsey's disappointment, Portsmouth did not contact him again.

Ramsey found the experience a thrilling adventure.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|p=28}} \"Until I travelled to [[Cornwall]], the longest journey I had undertaken was a trip to [[Brighton]] by train\", he recalled. \"It was the first time I had ever been into a hotel! Even with us sleeping twelve to a room, on straw mattresses, could not end for me the awe of living in a swagger hotel.\"{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=17}} \"That set the tone for Alf's war\", [[Leo McKinstry]] suggests in his 2010 biography; attached to his regiment's 6th Battalion, Ramsey spent the entire war in Britain on home defence duties.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=28\u201329}} The training was still physically demanding though, and, in Ramsey's words, made him \"a fitter young fellow than when I reported for duty as a grocery apprentice from Dagenham.\"{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=28\u201329}}\n\nWriting in 1952, Ramsey would call joining the army \"one of the greatest things which ever happened to me\", adding \"I learnt, in a few weeks, more about life in general that I had picked up in years at home.\"{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=17}} Military life taught Ramsey about discipline and leadership, and improved his social skills: \"I have never been very good at mixing with people but you have to in the army or else you are in trouble\", the journalist Nigel Clarke recalled him saying.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=28\u201329}} Ramsey rose to be a [[company quartermaster sergeant]] in an [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] unit.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n====Wartime football====\nMilitary service also allowed Ramsey to play football more regularly, and at a higher standard than before.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=30\u201331}} In late 1940 he was posted to [[St Austell]], on the south coast of Cornwall, where he manned beach defences and became captain of the battalion football team, playing at centre-half or [[centre-forward]] as circumstances dictated. After three years in various seaside postings, Ramsey was, in 1943, moved to [[Barton Stacey]] in [[Hampshire]], where he came under the command of a Colonel Fletcher, himself an accomplished footballer. Ramsey's battalion team by this time featured players from a number of Football League clubs, including the [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] forward [[Len Townsend]] and Arsenal's [[Cyril Hodges]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=30\u201331}} Ramsey played at centre-half for his battalion team as [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] defeated them 10\u20133 at [[The Dell, Southampton|the Dell]] in a pre-season [[Exhibition game|friendly]] on 21 August 1943, and a week later played again as the battalion took on Southampton's [[reserve team]].

After his unit returned to the south coast at the start of the 1944\u201345 season, Ramsey played in a trial match at Southampton, and performed well enough that the club offered a professional contract on wages of \u00a32 per match.

As natural wingers were not always known for their defensive qualities, Ramsey started dropping them in favour of attacking midfielders who could also drop back into defensive roles. This system proved revolutionary as it often baffled opposing full-backs, who would naturally expect to see a winger coming down the flank at them once the ball was kicked off: instead, the attacking midfielders and strikers were taking the ball through the middle of the defence and scoring. This style of play proved successful at Ipswich, but really showed its worth when England travelled to Spain to play a friendly with them before the World Cup. As [[Bobby Charlton]] remarked, \"The Spanish full-backs were just looking at each other while we were going in droves through the middle\". To win in Spain, who were the reigning European Champions, was rare for an English team and was evidence that Ramsey's techniques were working.<ref name=\"Orejan2011\">{{cite book|author=Jaime Orejan|title=Football/Soccer: History and Tactics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0l2T7tLSiEC&pg=PA112|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8566-6|page=112| accessdate = 21 March 2019}}</ref>\n<!--\nA firm but fair manager, Ramsey was often regarded as difficult by the press. He ran a strict regime with his players and made sure that no-one felt that they enjoyed special status, star player or not. In May 1964, after a number of players failed to show up for a meeting in a hotel about a forthcoming tour, amongst them Bobby Moore, [[Jimmy Greaves]] and [[Bobby Charlton]], they eventually returned to their rooms to discover their passports left on their beds. His strict regime didn't suit everyone but the players with real talent and respect for the game responded well to them and had great respect for Ramsey. Very few of those who played for Ramsey spoke ill of him. In the preparations for the 1966 World Cup, Ramsey made sure that no player was confident of a place in the final 22, which resulted in players performing at their highest level. His decision to appoint a young Bobby Moore as captain also showed Ramsey's ability to see great potential in young players. Another one of his abilities was as a master tactician: a quality that he had first shown with his reading of the game as a player. When it came to tactics, Ramsey had revolutionary ideas.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}-->\n\nRamsey earned the respect of his players. He strongly supported [[Nobby Stiles]] when the FA leaned on Ramsey to drop Stiles from the 1966 World Cup quarter-final following a tackle on Frenchman [[Jacques Simon (footballer)|Jacques Simon]] in the previous game.{{sfn|Lawton|2003|pp=168\u2013170}}  After the final, at the banquet, with the players in one room and their wives forced to sit in an adjoining room, he excused his players early from the banquet to allow the players to join their wives after nearly four weeks apart.{{sfn|Lawton|2003|p=208}} In his manner with the players, he was \"usually equable\", but when his 1978 Birmingham City team produced a poor defensive display, \"he blew his top\"; the next game was a \"historic victory\".<ref name=\"BrumMail\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nRamsey was very sensitive about his personal background. He strove to mask his [[working-class]] Essex origins and to present himself as erudite and worldly, going so far as to adopt an accent that the journalist [[Brian Glanville]] called \"sergeant-major posh\".{{sfn|Dickinson|2014|p=71}} A widely held perception that Ramsey's accent had become more upper-class during his time as England manager fuelled speculation that he had received [[elocution]] lessons, and prompted constant joking from members of the England team who came from similar Essex or East London backgrounds, such as Bobby Moore and Jimmy Greaves.{{sfn|Dickinson|2014|p=71}} [[Rodney Marsh]], a forward from the East End who played in Ramsey's England team from 1971 to 1973, later said:\n<blockquote>\nAlf tended to speak in a very poncey plum-in-the-mouth way.
