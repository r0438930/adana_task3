Spinoff merchandise includes dishes, wallpaper, and dolls. He appears as a character in several adaptations.\n\n==Background==\nThe rabbits in Potter's stories are [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and wear human clothes: Peter wears a blue jacket with brass buttons and shoes. Peter, his widowed mother, Mrs. Josephine Rabbit, as well as his sisters, Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail live in a rabbit hole that has a human kitchen, human furniture, as well as a shop where Josephine sells various items. Peter's relatives are Cousin [[Benjamin Bunny]] and Benjamin's father, Mr. Bouncer Bunny.\n\nPeter Rabbit was named after a pet rabbit whom [[Beatrix Potter]] had as a child, and whom she called Peter Piper. The first Peter Rabbit story, ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'', was created in 1893 initially as a letter to Noel Moore, the five-year-old son of Potter's former governess, Annie Moore. The boy was ill, and Potter wrote him a picture and story letter to help him pass the time and to cheer him up. The letter included sketches illustrating the narrative.\n\nIn June 1903, a trade edition of the tale was published by [[Frederick Warne & Co]], and by the end of the year, 28,000 copies were in print. Over the years, ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, and as of 2008, the Peter Rabbit series has sold more than 151 million copies in 35 languages.<ref>{{cite web | title=United Media Licensing \u2013 PETER RABBIT | url= http://www.unitedmedialicensing.com/b2b/html/peter_rabbit.html | work=United Media Licensing | accessdate=23 June 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060324113634/http://www.unitedmedialicensing.com/b2b/html/peter_rabbit.html |archivedate = 24 March 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cctv.com/program/cultureexpress/20080613/101158.shtml|title=Beatrix Potter goes green|publisher=CCTV International|date=13 June 2008}}</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit - initial history as a letter to Noel Moore\">\nFile:The Tale of Peter Rabbit - letter to Noel Moore part 1.jpg\nFile:The Tale of Peter Rabbit - letter to Noel Moore part 2.jpg\nFile:The Tale of Peter Rabbit - letter to Noel Moore part 3.jpg\nFile:The Tale of Peter Rabbit - letter to Noel Moore part 4.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Books==\n[[File:Peter rabbit flopsy bunnies.jpg|thumb|Grown up Peter in his nursery garden, from ''[[The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies]]'']]\n\nPeter Rabbit made his first appearance in 1902 in ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]''. Where Peter disobeys Josephine's orders and sneaks into [[Mr. McGregor]]'s garden, eating as many vegetables as he can before Mr. McGregor spots and chases him. Peter manages to escape, but not before losing his jacket and shoes, which Mr. McGregor uses to dress a [[scarecrow]]. Peter returns home weary, ill, and naked and is put to bed with a dose of [[chamomile]] tea.\n\nIn ''[[The Tale of Benjamin Bunny]]'', first published in 1904, Peter's cousin Benjamin Bunny brings him back to Mr. McGregor's garden and they retrieve the clothes Peter lost in ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit''. However, after they gather onions to give to Josephine, they are captured by Mr. McGregor's cat. Bouncer arrives and rescues them, but also reprimands Peter and Benjamin for going into the garden by whipping them with a [[Switch (corporal punishment)|switch]]. In this tale, Peter displays some trepidation about returning to the garden.\n\nIn ''[[The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies]]'', first published in 1909, Peter has a small role and appears only briefly. He is grown up and his sister Flopsy is now married to their cousin Benjamin. The two are the parents of six little Flopsy Bunnies.

Peter helps Benjamin chase after Brock, who hides out in the house of the fox, Mr. Tod. Mr. Tod finds Brock sleeping in his bed, and as the two get into a scuffle, Peter and Benjamin rescue the children.\n\nPeter makes [[cameo appearance]]s in two other tales. In ''[[The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle]]'', first published in 1905, Peter and Benjamin are customers of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, a [[hedgehog]] washerwoman.
