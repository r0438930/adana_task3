{"title_page": "Dasein", "text_new": "{{Italic title}}\n'''''Dasein''''' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8da\u02d0za\u026an}}) is a [[German language|German]] word that means \"being there\" or \"presence\" (German: ''[[wikt:da#German|da]]'' \"there\"; ''[[wikt:sein#German|sein]]'' \"being\"), and is often translated into English with the word \"existence\". It is a fundamental concept in the [[existential philosophy]] of [[Martin Heidegger]], particularly in his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' ''[[Being and Time]]''. Heidegger uses the expression ''Dasein'' to refer to the experience of [[being]] that is peculiar to human beings. Thus it is a form of being that is aware of and must confront such issues as [[person]]hood, [[Death|mortality]] and the dilemma or paradox of living in relationship with other humans while being ultimately alone with oneself.\n\n==Heidegger's re-interpretation==\nIn German, ''Dasein'' is the vernacular term for \"existence\", as in \"I am pleased with my existence\" (''Ich bin mit meinem Dasein zufrieden''). The term has been used by several philosophers before Heidegger, most notably [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], with the meaning of human \"existence\" or \"presence\". It is derived from ''da-sein'', which literally means ''being-there/there-being''<ref name=\"Cultural Criticism 1995 p. 70\">J. Childers/G.

Collins/H.

Due to the drastically different use of the term \"''Dasein''\" between the two philosophers, there is often some confusion in students who begin with either Heidegger or Jaspers and subsequently study the other.\n\nIn ''Philosophy'' (3 vols, 1932), Jaspers gave his view of the history of philosophy and introduced his major themes. Beginning with modern science and empiricism, Jaspers points out that as we question reality, we confront borders that an empirical (or scientific) method can simply not transcend. At this point, the individual faces a choice: sink into despair and resignation, or take a [[leap of faith]] toward what Jaspers calls \"Transcendence\". In making this leap, individuals confront their own limitless freedom, which Jaspers calls ''Existenz'', and can finally experience authentic existence.\n\n== Other applications ==\n[[Eero Tarasti]] considered ''Dasein'' very important in ''Existential Semiotics''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Existential Semiotics |series=Advances in Semiotics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FySwDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |first=Eero |last=Tarasti |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |year=2000 |isbn=9780253337221 |page=218}}</ref>{{rp|218}}\n\n[[Jacques Lacan]] turned in the 1950s to Heidegger's Dasein for his characterisation of the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] as being-for-death:  (''\u00eatre-pour-la-mort'').<ref>E.
