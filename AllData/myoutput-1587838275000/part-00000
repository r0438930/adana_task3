The term is also used for the area north and west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]], although the exact boundaries are not clearly defined, particularly to the east. The [[Great Glen]] divides the [[Grampian Mountains]] to the southeast from the [[Northwest Highlands]]. The [[Scottish Gaelic]] name of ''{{lang|gd|[[A' Gh\u00e0idhealtachd]]}}'' literally means \"the place of the Gaels\" and traditionally, from a Gaelic-speaking point of view, includes both the [[Western Isles]] and the Highlands.\n\nThe area is very sparsely populated, with many [[mountain range]]s dominating the region, and includes the highest mountain in the [[British Isles]], [[Ben Nevis]]. During the 18th and early 19th centuries the population of the Highlands rose to around 300,000, but from c. 1841 and for the next 160 years, the natural increase in population was exceeded by emigration (mostly to Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and migration to the industrial cities of Scotland and England.)<ref name=\"Richards 2013\">{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Eric|title=The Highland Clearances People, Landlords and Rural Turmoil|date=2000|publisher=Birlinn Limited|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-78027-165-1|edition=2013}}</ref>{{rp|xxiii, 414 and ''passim''}} The area is now one of the most sparsely populated in Europe.

However, the Highlands also includes parts of the [[subdivisions of Scotland|council areas]] of [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]], [[Argyll and Bute]], [[Moray]], [[North Ayrshire]], [[Perth and Kinross]], [[Stirling (council area)|Stirling]] and [[West Dunbartonshire]].\n\nThe Scottish highlands is the only area in the British Isles to have the [[taiga]] biome as it features concentrated populations of [[Scots pine]] forest: see [[Caledonian Forest]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Culture===\n[[File:Scottish clan map.png|thumb|Map of [[Scottish clan|Scottish Highland clans]] and lowland families]]\n[[File:John Frederick Lewis - Highland Hospitality - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Highland Hospitality'', painted by [[John Frederick Lewis]], 1832]]\n[[File:Battle of Alma Sutherland highlanders.png|thumb|[[Battle of Alma]], [[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|Sutherland Highlanders]]]]\nBetween the 15th century and the mid-20th century, the area differed from most of the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] in terms of language.

The terms are sometimes used interchangeably but have different meanings in their respective languages.

While the Highland line broadly followed the geography of the Grampians in the south, it continued in the north, cutting off the north-eastern areas, that is Eastern [[Caithness]], Orkney and [[Shetland]], from the more Gaelic Highlands and Hebrides.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ladysue.webs.com/thescotsirish.htm |title=The Highland Line |publisher=Sue & Marilyn |accessdate=8 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808033552/http://ladysue.webs.com/thescotsirish.htm |archive-date=8 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/geog/ |title=Historical Geography of the Clans of Scotland |publisher=Electricscotland.com |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the major social unit of the Highlands was the [[Scottish clan|clan]]. Scottish kings, particularly [[James VI and I|James VI]], saw clans as a challenge to their authority; the Highlands was seen by many as a lawless region. Following the [[Union of the Crowns]], James VI had the military strength to back up any attempts to impose some control. The result was, in 1609, the [[Statutes of Iona]] which started the process of integrating clan leaders into Scottish society. The gradual changes continued into the 19th century, as clan chiefs thought of themselves less as patriarchal leaders of their people and more as commercial landlords. The first effect on the clansmen who were their tenants was the change to rents being payable in money rather than in kind. Later, rents were increased as Highland landowners sought to increase their income. This was followed, mostly in the period 1760\u20131850, by [[Scottish Agricultural Revolution|agricultural improvement]] that often (particularly in the Western Highlands) involved [[Highland clearances|clearance]] of the population to make way for large scale sheep farms. Displaced tenants were set up in [[crofting]] communities in the process. The crofts were intended not to provide all the needs of their occupiers; they were expected to work in other industries such as kelping and fishing. Crofters came to rely substantially on seasonal migrant work, particularly in the Lowlands. This gave impetus to the learning of English, which was seen by many rural Gaelic speakers to be the essential \"language of work\".<ref name=\"Dodgshon\">{{cite book |last1=Dodgshon |first1=Robert A. |title=From Chiefs to Landlords: Social and Economic Change in the Western Highlands and Islands, c. 1493\u20131820 |date=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0-7486-1034-0}}</ref>{{rp|105\u201307}}<ref name=\"Devine 1994\">{{cite book|last1=Devine|first1=T M|title=Clanship to Crofters' War: The social transformation of the Scottish Highlands|date=1994|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-9076-9|edition=2013}}</ref>{{rp|1\u201317, 110\u201318}}<ref name=\"Devine 2018\">{{cite book |last1=Devine |first1=T M |title=The Scottish Clearances: A History of the Dispossessed, 1600\u20131900|date=2018 |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |isbn=978-0241304105}}</ref>{{rp|37\u201346, 65\u201373, 132}}\n\nOlder historiography attributes the collapse of the clan system to the aftermath of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] risings. This is now thought less influential by historians. Following the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]] the British government enacted a series of laws to try to suppress the [[Scottish clan|clan system]], including [[Disarming Act|bans on the bearing of arms]] and the wearing of [[tartan]], and limitations on the activities of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]]. Most of this legislation was repealed by the end of the 18th century as the Jacobite threat subsided. There was soon a rehabilitation of Highland culture. Tartan was adopted for Highland regiments in the British Army, which poor Highlanders joined in large numbers in the era of the Revolutionary and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1790\u20131815). Tartan had largely been abandoned by the ordinary people of the region, but in the 1820s, tartan and the [[kilt]] were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe.<ref name=\"Roberts2002pp193-4\">{{cite book |author=John Lenox Roberts |title=The Jacobite Wars: Scotland and the Military Campaigns of 1715 and 1745 |year=2002 |publisher=Polygon at Edinburgh |pages=193\u201395 |isbn=9781902930299 }}</ref><ref name=\"Sievers2007\">{{cite book |author=Marco Sievers |title=The Highland Myth as an Invented Tradition of 18th and 19th Century and Its Significance for the Image of Scotland |year=2007 |publisher=GRIN Verlag |pages=22\u201325 |isbn=9783638816519 }}</ref> The international craze for tartan, and for idealising a romanticised Highlands, was set off by the [[Ossian]] cycle,<ref>{{cite book |author1=Deidre Dawson |author2=Pierre Mor\u00e8re |title=Scotland and France in the Enlightenment |year=2004 |publisher=Bucknell University Press |pages=75\u201376 |isbn=978-0838755266 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=William Ferguson |title=The Identity of the Scottish Nation: An Historic Quest |year=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=227 |isbn=978-0748610716 }}</ref> and further popularised by the works of [[Walter Scott]]. His \"staging\" of the [[visit of King George IV to Scotland]] in 1822 and the king's wearing of tartan resulted in a massive upsurge in demand for kilts and tartans that could not be met by the Scottish woollen industry.

There was a critical reliance on this trade to provide sufficient food, and it is seen as an essential prerequisite for the population growth that started in the 18th century.{{r|Richards 2013|p=48\u201349}} Most of the Highlands, particularly in the North and West was short of the arable land that was essential for the mixed, [[run rig]] based, communal farming that existed before [[Scottish Agricultural Revolution|agricultural improvement]] was introduced into the region.{{efn|It has been estimated that only 9% of the land in the Highlands is suitable for cultivation.{{r|Devine 2018|p=18}}}} Between the 1760s and the 1830s there was a substantial trade in unlicensed [[Scotch whisky#History|whisky]] that had been distilled in the Highlands. Lowland distillers (who were not able to avoid the heavy taxation of this product) complained that Highland whisky made up more than half the market. The development of the cattle trade is taken as evidence that the pre-improvement Highlands was not an immutable system, but did exploit the economic opportunities that came its way.{{r|Devine 2018|p=24}} The illicit whisky trade demonstrates the entrepreneurial ability of the peasant classes.<ref name=\"Devine 1994\"/>{{rp|119\u201334}}\n\nAgricultural improvement reached the Highlands mostly over the period 1760 to 1850.

Sheep farmers could pay substantially higher rents than the run rig farmers and were much less prone to falling into arrears. Each croft was limited in size so that the tenants would have to find work elsewhere. The major alternatives were fishing and the kelp industry. Landlords took control of the kelp shores, deducting the wages earned by their tenants from the rent due and retaining the large profits that could be earned at the high prices paid for the processed product during the Napoleonic wars.{{r|Devine 1995|p=1\u201312}}\n[[File:William Allsworth - The emigrants - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Scottish Highland family migrating to [[New Zealand]] in 1844]]\nWhen the Napoleonic wars finished in 1815, the Highland industries were affected by the return to a peacetime economy. The price of black cattle fell, nearly halving between 1810 and the 1830s. Kelp prices had peaked in 1810, but reduced from \u00a39 a ton in 1823 to \u00a33 13s 4d a ton in 1828.

Then, in 1846, [[potato blight]] arrived in the Highlands, wiping out the essential subsistence crop for the overcrowded crofting communities. As the [[Highland potato famine|famine]] struck, the government made clear to landlords that it was their responsibility to provide famine relief for their tenants. The result of the economic downturn had been that a large proportion of Highland estates were sold in the first half of the 19th century. [[Tom Devine|T M Devine]] points out that in the region most affected by the potato famine, by 1846, 70 per cent of the landowners were new purchasers who had not owned Highland property before 1800. More landlords were obliged to sell due to the cost of famine relief. Those who were protected from the worst of the crisis were those with extensive rental income from sheep farms.{{r|Devine 1995|p=93\u201395}} Government loans were made available for drainage works, road building and other improvements and many crofters became temporary migrants \u2013 taking work in the Lowlands. When the potato famine ceased in 1856, this established a pattern of more extensive working away from the Highlands.{{r|Devine 1995|p=146\u201366}}\n\nThe unequal concentration of land ownership remained an emotional and controversial subject, of enormous importance to the Highland economy, and eventually became a cornerstone of liberal radicalism. The poor crofters were politically powerless, and many of them turned to religion. They embraced the popularly oriented, fervently evangelical Presbyterian revival after 1800.<ref>{{cite book |author=Thomas Martin Devine |title=The Scottish Nation |year=1999 |publisher=Penguin Books |chapter=Chapter 18 |isbn=978-0670888115 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/scottishnation170000devi }}</ref> Most joined the breakaway \"Free Church\" after 1843. This [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] movement was led by lay preachers who themselves came from the lower strata, and whose preaching was implicitly critical of the established order. The religious change energised the crofters and separated them from the landlords; it helped prepare them for their successful and violent challenge to the landlords in the 1880s through the [[Highland Land League]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=James Hunter |year=1974 |title=The Emergence of the Crofting Community: The Religious Contribution 1798\u20131843 |journal=Scottish Studies |volume=18 |pages=95\u2013116 }}</ref>\nViolence erupted, starting on the [[Isle of Skye]], when Highland landlords cleared their lands for sheep and deer parks.

In 1885 three Independent Crofter candidates were elected to Parliament, which listened to their pleas. The results included explicit security for the Scottish smallholders in the \"crofting counties\"; the legal right to bequeath tenancies to descendants; and the creation of a Crofting Commission.

(Other sources treat The Islands, except Islay, as a separate whisky producing region.) This massive area has over 30 distilleries, or 47 when the Islands sub-region is included in the count.<ref>[https://www.visitscotland.com/see-do/food-drink/whisky/distilleries/highland/ Highlands Distilleries]</ref> According to one source, the top five are The Macallan, Glenfiddich, Aberlour, Glenfarclas and Balvenie. While Speyside is geographically within the Highlands, that region is specified as distinct in terms of whisky productions.<ref name=\"manofmany.com\">[https://manofmany.com/lifestyle/drinks/guide-to-scotland-whisky-regions?amp   A Comprehensive Guide to Scotland\u2019s Whisky Regions]</ref> [[Speyside single malt]] whiskies are produced by about 50 distilleries.<ref>[https://manofmany.com/lifestyle/drinks/guide-to-scotland-whisky-regions?amp]</ref>\n\nAccording to ''Visit Scotland'', Highlands whisky is \"fruity, sweet, spicy, malty\".<ref>https://www.visitscotland.com/see-do/food-drink/whisky/distilleries/highland/ | WHISKY DISTILLERIES IN THE HIGHLANDS</ref> Another review<ref name=\"manofmany.com\"/> states that Northern Highlands single malt is \"sweet and full-bodied\", the Eastern Highlands and Southern Highlands whiskies tend to be \"lighter in texture\" while the distilleries in the Western Highlands produce single malts with a \"much peatier influence\".\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Loch Long.jpg|thumb|[[Loch Long]]]]\nThe [[Scottish Reformation]] achieved partial success in the Highlands. Roman Catholicism remained strong in some areas, owing to remote locations and the efforts of [[Franciscan]] missionaries from Ireland, who regularly came to celebrate [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. There remain significant Catholic strongholds within the Highlands and Islands such as [[Moidart]] and [[Morar]] on the mainland and [[South Uist]] and [[Barra]] in the southern Outer Hebrides.\nThe remoteness of the region and the lack of a Gaelic-speaking clergy undermined the missionary efforts of the established church. The later 18th century saw somewhat greater success, owing to the efforts of the [[Scottish SPCK|SSPCK]] missionaries and to the disruption of traditional society after the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746. In the 19th century, the evangelical Free Churches, which were more accepting of Gaelic language and culture, grew rapidly, appealing much more strongly than did the established church.<ref>{{cite journal |author=George Robb |year=1990 |title=Popular Religion and the Christianisation of the Highlands in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries |journal=Journal of Religious History |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages= 18\u201334 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9809.1990.tb00647.x}}</ref>\n\nFor the most part, however, the Highlands are considered predominantly Protestant, loyal to the [[Church of Scotland]]. In contrast to the Catholic southern islands, the northern [[Outer Hebrides]] islands (Lewis, Harris and North Uist) have an exceptionally high proportion of their population belonging to the Protestant [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] or the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland]]. The [[Outer Hebrides]] have been described as the last bastion of [[Calvinism]] in Britain<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/apr/10/religion.world |title=Fury at ferry crossing on Sabbath |date=10 April 2006 |author=Gerard Seenan |work=The Guardian |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}</ref> and the Sabbath remains widely observed. Inverness and the surrounding area has a majority Protestant population, with most locals belonging to either [[Church of Scotland|The Kirk]] or the [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]. The church maintains a noticeable presence within the area, with church attendance notably higher than in other Scottish cities. Religion continues to play an important role in Highland culture, with Sabbath observance still widely practised, particularly in the Hebrides.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-12847619 |title=Battle looms in Outer Hebrides over Sabbath opening |date=29 March 2011 |last=Cook |first=James |work=BBC News|accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Historical geography==\n[[File:Inverness Ness&Castle 15751.JPG|thumb|right|[[Inverness]], the administrative centre and traditional capital of the Highlands]]\n[[File:Allt a' Mhuilinn.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ben Nevis]] from the path to the CIC Hut alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn]]\nIn traditional Scottish [[geography]], the Highlands refers to that part of Scotland north-west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]], which crosses mainland Scotland in a near-straight line from [[Helensburgh]] to [[Stonehaven]]. However the flat coastal lands that occupy parts of the counties of [[Nairnshire]], Morayshire, [[Banffshire]] and [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]] are often excluded as they do not share the distinctive geographical and cultural features of the rest of the Highlands. The north-east of [[Caithness]], as well as [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]], are also often excluded from the Highlands, although the [[Hebrides]] are usually included. The Highland area, as so defined, differed from the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] in language and tradition, having preserved [[Gaels|Gaelic]] speech and customs centuries after the [[anglicisation]] of the latter; this led to a growing perception of a divide, with the cultural distinction between Highlander and Lowlander first noted towards the end of the 14th century. In [[Aberdeenshire]], the boundary between the Highlands and the Lowlands is not well defined. There is a stone beside the [[A93 road]] near the village of [[Dinnet]] on [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|Royal Deeside]] which states 'You are now in the Highlands', although there are areas of Highland character to the east of this point.\n\nA much wider definition of the Highlands is that used by the [[Scotch Whisky]] industry. [[Highland Single Malts]] are produced at distilleries north of an imaginary line between [[Dundee]] and [[Greenock]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/understanding-scotch/whisky-regions-tours/ |title=Whisky Regions & Tours |publisher=Scotch Whisky Association |accessdate=8 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726201832/http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/understanding-scotch/whisky-regions-tours/ |archive-date=26 July 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> thus including all of [[Aberdeenshire]] and [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]].\n\n[[Inverness]] is regarded as the Capital of the Highlands,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland-inverness.co.uk/inverness.htm |title=Inverness: Capital of the Scottish Highlands |publisher=Internet Guide to Scotland |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}</ref> although less so in the Highland parts of [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]], Perthshire and [[Stirlingshire]] which look more to [[Aberdeen]], Dundee, [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], and [[Stirling]] as their commercial centres. {{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Scotland Info Guide |url=https://www.scotlandinfo.eu/scottish-highlands/}}</ref>\n\n===Highland Council area===\nThe [[Highland Council]] area, created as one of the local government [[Subdivisions of Scotland|regions of Scotland]], has been a [[unitary authority|unitary council]] area since 1996. The council area excludes a large area of the southern and eastern Highlands, and the [[Western Isles]], but includes [[Caithness]]. ''Highlands'' is sometimes used, however, as a name for the council area, as in ''[[Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service]]''. ''[[Northern Scotland|Northern]]'', as in ''[[Northern Constabulary]]'', is also used to refer to the area covered by the fire and rescue service. This area consists of the Highland council area and the [[Island council areas of Scotland|island council areas]] of [[Orkney]], Shetland and the Western Isles.\n\nHighland Council signs in the [[Pass of Drumochter]], between [[Glen Garry]] and [[Dalwhinnie]], say \"Welcome to the Highlands\".\n\n===Highlands and Islands===\n[[File:Blue is coming in Quiraing (14942990740).jpg|thumb|[[Isle of Skye]]]]\nMuch of the Highlands area overlaps the [[Highlands and Islands]] area. An [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|electoral region]] called ''[[Highlands and Islands (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Highlands and Islands]]'' is used in elections to the [[Scottish Parliament]]: this area includes [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]], as well as the Highland Council local government area, the [[Western Isles]] and most of the [[Argyll and Bute]] and [[Moray]] local government areas. ''Highlands and Islands'' has, however, different meanings in different contexts. It means Highland (the local government area), Orkney, Shetland, and the Western Isles in ''[[Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service]]''. ''[[Northern Scotland|Northern]]'', as in ''[[Northern Constabulary]]'', refers to the same area as that covered by the fire and rescue service.\n\n===Historical crossings===\nThere have been [[trackway]]s from the Lowlands to the Highlands since [[prehistoric]] times. Many traverse the [[Mounth]], a spur of mountainous land that extends from the higher inland range to the [[North Sea]] slightly north of [[Stonehaven]]. The most well-known and historically important trackways are the [[Causey Mounth]], [[Elsick Mounth]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18037 |title=Elsick Mounth \u2013 Ancient Trackway in Scotland in Aberdeenshire |date=22 November 2007 |author=C Michael Hogan |publisher=The Megalithic Portal |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}</ref> [[Cryne Corse Mounth]] and [[Cairnamounth]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_063/63_102_138.pdf |title=The Early Castles of Mar |date=10 December 1928 |author=W.

They thus charge additional fees for delivery to the Highlands, or exclude the area entirely. Whilst the physical remoteness from the largest population centres inevitably leads to higher transit cost, there is confusion and consternation over the scale of the fees charged and the effectiveness of their communication,<ref name=\"CABcouriers\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cas.org.uk/news/3000-angry-scots-respond-cab-survey-rural-delivery-charges|title=3,000 angry Scots respond to CAB survey on rural delivery charges |date=25 January 2012 |publisher=2012 [[The Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux]] \u2013 Citizens Advice Scotland (Scottish charity SC016637) |accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref> and the use of the word Mainland in their justification. Since the charges are often based on postcode areas, many far less remote areas, including some which are traditionally considered part of the lowlands, are also subject to these charges.<ref name=\"CABcouriers\"/> [[Royal Mail]] is the only delivery network bound by a Universal Service Obligation to charge a uniform tariff across the UK.

This part of Scotland is largely composed of ancient rocks from the [[Cambrian]] and [[Precambrian]] periods which were [[Tectonic uplift|uplifted]] during the later [[Caledonian Orogeny]]. Smaller formations of [[Lewisian complex|Lewisian gneiss]] in the northwest are up to 3&nbsp;billion years old. The overlying rocks of the [[Torridonian|Torridon Sandstone]] form mountains in the [[Torridon Hills]] such as [[Liathach]] and [[Beinn Eighe]] in [[Wester Ross]].\n\nThese foundations are interspersed with many [[igneous]] intrusions of a more recent age, the remnants of which have formed mountain [[massif]]s such as the [[Cairngorms]] and the [[Cuillin]] of [[Skye]]. A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of [[Old Red Sandstone]] found principally along the [[Moray Firth]] coast and partially down the Highland Boundary Fault. The [[Jurassic]] beds found in isolated locations on [[Skye]] and [[Applecross]] reflect the complex underlying geology. They are the original source of much [[North Sea oil]]. The [[Great Glen]] is formed along a [[transform fault]] which divides the [[Grampian Mountains]] to the southeast from the [[Northwest Highlands]].<ref name=Keay>{{cite book |author=John Keay, Julia Keay |title=Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland |url=https://archive.org/details/collinsencyclopa00john |url-access=registration |year=1994 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=9780007103539 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=William Hutchison Murray |title=The islands of Western Scotland: the Inner and Outer Hebrides |year=1973 |publisher=Eyre Methuen |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nThe entire region was covered by ice sheets during the [[Pleistocene]] ice ages, save perhaps for a few [[nunatak]]s.

During the 18th and early 19th centuries the population of the Highlands rose to around 300,000, but from c. 1841 and for the next 160 years, the natural increase in population was exceeded by emigration (mostly to Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and migration to the industrial cities of Scotland and England.)<ref name=\"Richards 2013\">{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Eric|title=The Highland Clearances People, Landlords and Rural Turmoil|date=2000|publisher=Birlinn Limited|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-78027-165-1|edition=2013}}</ref>{{rp|xxiii, 414 and ''passim''}} The area is now one of the most sparsely populated in Europe.

Scottish kings, particularly [[James VI and I|James VI]], saw clans as a challenge to their authority; the Highlands was seen by many as a lawless region. Following the [[Union of the Crowns]], James VI had the military strength to back up any attempts to impose some control. The result was, in 1609, the [[Statutes of Iona]] which started the process of integrating clan leaders into Scottish society. The gradual changes continued into the 19th century, as clan chiefs thought of themselves less as patriarchal leaders of their people and more as commercial landlords. The first effect on the clansmen who were their tenants was the change to rents being payable in money rather than in kind. Later, rents were increased as Highland landowners sought to increase their income. This was followed, mostly in the period 1760\u20131850, by [[Scottish Agricultural Revolution|agricultural improvement]] that often (particularly in the Western Highlands) involved [[Highland clearances|clearance]] of the population to make way for large scale sheep farms. Displaced tenants were set up in [[crofting]] communities in the process. The crofts were intended not to provide all the needs of their occupiers; they were expected to work in other industries such as kelping and fishing. Crofters came to rely substantially on seasonal migrant work, particularly in the Lowlands. This gave impetus to the learning of English, which was seen by many rural Gaelic speakers to be the essential \"language of work\".<ref name=\"Dodgshon\">{{cite book |last1=Dodgshon |first1=Robert A. |title=From Chiefs to Landlords: Social and Economic Change in the Western Highlands and Islands, c. 1493\u20131820 |date=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0-7486-1034-0}}</ref>{{rp|105\u201307}}<ref name=\"Devine 1994\">{{cite book|last1=Devine|first1=T M|title=Clanship to Crofters' War: The social transformation of the Scottish Highlands|date=1994|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-9076-9|edition=2013}}</ref>{{rp|1\u201317, 110\u201318}}<ref name=\"Devine 2018\">{{cite book |last1=Devine |first1=T M |title=The Scottish Clearances: A History of the Dispossessed, 1600\u20131900|date=2018 |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |isbn=978-0241304105}}</ref>{{rp|37\u201346, 65\u201373, 132}}\n\nOlder historiography attributes the collapse of the clan system to the aftermath of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] risings. This is now thought less influential by historians. Following the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]] the British government enacted a series of laws to try to suppress the [[Scottish clan|clan system]], including [[Disarming Act|bans on the bearing of arms]] and the wearing of [[tartan]], and limitations on the activities of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]]. Most of this legislation was repealed by the end of the 18th century as the Jacobite threat subsided. There was soon a rehabilitation of Highland culture. Tartan was adopted for Highland regiments in the British Army, which poor Highlanders joined in large numbers in the era of the Revolutionary and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1790\u20131815). Tartan had largely been abandoned by the ordinary people of the region, but in the 1820s, tartan and the [[kilt]] were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe.<ref name=\"Roberts2002pp193-4\">{{cite book |author=John Lenox Roberts |title=The Jacobite Wars: Scotland and the Military Campaigns of 1715 and 1745 |year=2002 |publisher=Polygon at Edinburgh |pages=193\u201395 |isbn=9781902930299 }}</ref><ref name=\"Sievers2007\">{{cite book |author=Marco Sievers |title=The Highland Myth as an Invented Tradition of 18th and 19th Century and Its Significance for the Image of Scotland |year=2007 |publisher=GRIN Verlag |pages=22\u201325 |isbn=9783638816519 }}</ref> The international craze for tartan, and for idealising a romanticised Highlands, was set off by the [[Ossian]] cycle,<ref>{{cite book |author1=Deidre Dawson |author2=Pierre Mor\u00e8re |title=Scotland and France in the Enlightenment |year=2004 |publisher=Bucknell University Press |pages=75\u201376 |isbn=978-0838755266 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=William Ferguson |title=The Identity of the Scottish Nation: An Historic Quest |year=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=227 |isbn=978-0748610716 }}</ref> and further popularised by the works of [[Walter Scott]].

Sheep farmers could pay substantially higher rents than the run rig farmers and were much less prone to falling into arrears. Each croft was limited in size so that the tenants would have to find work elsewhere. The major alternatives were fishing and the kelp industry. Landlords took control of the kelp shores, deducting the wages earned by their tenants from the rent due and retaining the large profits that could be earned at the high prices paid for the processed product during the Napoleonic wars.{{r|Devine 1995|p=1\u201312}}\n[[File:William Allsworth - The emigrants - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Scottish Highland family migrating to [[New Zealand]] in 1844]]\nWhen the Napoleonic wars finished in 1815, the Highland industries were affected by the return to a peacetime economy.

Then, in 1846, [[potato blight]] arrived in the Highlands, wiping out the essential subsistence crop for the overcrowded crofting communities. As the [[Highland potato famine|famine]] struck, the government made clear to landlords that it was their responsibility to provide famine relief for their tenants. The result of the economic downturn had been that a large proportion of Highland estates were sold in the first half of the 19th century. [[Tom Devine|T M Devine]] points out that in the region most affected by the potato famine, by 1846, 70 per cent of the landowners were new purchasers who had not owned Highland property before 1800. More landlords were obliged to sell due to the cost of famine relief. Those who were protected from the worst of the crisis were those with extensive rental income from sheep farms.{{r|Devine 1995|p=93\u201395}} Government loans were made available for drainage works, road building and other improvements and many crofters became temporary migrants \u2013 taking work in the Lowlands.

This [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] movement was led by lay preachers who themselves came from the lower strata, and whose preaching was implicitly critical of the established order.

The Highland area, as so defined, differed from the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] in language and tradition, having preserved [[Gaels|Gaelic]] speech and customs centuries after the [[anglicisation]] of the latter; this led to a growing perception of a divide, with the cultural distinction between Highlander and Lowlander first noted towards the end of the 14th century. In [[Aberdeenshire]], the boundary between the Highlands and the Lowlands is not well defined. There is a stone beside the [[A93 road]] near the village of [[Dinnet]] on [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|Royal Deeside]] which states 'You are now in the Highlands', although there are areas of Highland character to the east of this point.\n\nA much wider definition of the Highlands is that used by the [[Scotch Whisky]] industry. [[Highland Single Malts]] are produced at distilleries north of an imaginary line between [[Dundee]] and [[Greenock]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/understanding-scotch/whisky-regions-tours/ |title=Whisky Regions & Tours |publisher=Scotch Whisky Association |accessdate=8 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726201832/http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/understanding-scotch/whisky-regions-tours/ |archive-date=26 July 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> thus including all of [[Aberdeenshire]] and [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]].\n\n[[Inverness]] is regarded as the Capital of the Highlands,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland-inverness.co.uk/inverness.htm |title=Inverness: Capital of the Scottish Highlands |publisher=Internet Guide to Scotland |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}</ref> although less so in the Highland parts of [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]], Perthshire and [[Stirlingshire]] which look more to [[Aberdeen]], Dundee, [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], and [[Stirling]] as their commercial centres. {{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Scotland Info Guide |url=https://www.scotlandinfo.eu/scottish-highlands/}}</ref>\n\n===Highland Council area===\nThe [[Highland Council]] area, created as one of the local government [[Subdivisions of Scotland|regions of Scotland]], has been a [[unitary authority|unitary council]] area since 1996. The council area excludes a large area of the southern and eastern Highlands, and the [[Western Isles]], but includes [[Caithness]]. ''Highlands'' is sometimes used, however, as a name for the council area, as in ''[[Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service]]''. ''[[Northern Scotland|Northern]]'', as in ''[[Northern Constabulary]]'', is also used to refer to the area covered by the fire and rescue service. This area consists of the Highland council area and the [[Island council areas of Scotland|island council areas]] of [[Orkney]], Shetland and the Western Isles.\n\nHighland Council signs in the [[Pass of Drumochter]], between [[Glen Garry]] and [[Dalwhinnie]], say \"Welcome to the Highlands\".\n\n===Highlands and Islands===\n[[File:Blue is coming in Quiraing (14942990740).jpg|thumb|[[Isle of Skye]]]]\nMuch of the Highlands area overlaps the [[Highlands and Islands]] area. An [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|electoral region]] called ''[[Highlands and Islands (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Highlands and Islands]]'' is used in elections to the [[Scottish Parliament]]: this area includes [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]], as well as the Highland Council local government area, the [[Western Isles]] and most of the [[Argyll and Bute]] and [[Moray]] local government areas. ''Highlands and Islands'' has, however, different meanings in different contexts. It means Highland (the local government area), Orkney, Shetland, and the Western Isles in ''[[Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service]]''. ''[[Northern Scotland|Northern]]'', as in ''[[Northern Constabulary]]'', refers to the same area as that covered by the fire and rescue service.\n\n===Historical crossings===\nThere have been [[trackway]]s from the Lowlands to the Highlands since [[prehistoric]] times. Many traverse the [[Mounth]], a spur of mountainous land that extends from the higher inland range to the [[North Sea]] slightly north of [[Stonehaven]]. The most well-known and historically important trackways are the [[Causey Mounth]], [[Elsick Mounth]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18037 |title=Elsick Mounth \u2013 Ancient Trackway in Scotland in Aberdeenshire |date=22 November 2007 |author=C Michael Hogan |publisher=The Megalithic Portal |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}</ref> [[Cryne Corse Mounth]] and [[Cairnamounth]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_063/63_102_138.pdf |title=The Early Castles of Mar |date=10 December 1928 |author=W.

They thus charge additional fees for delivery to the Highlands, or exclude the area entirely. Whilst the physical remoteness from the largest population centres inevitably leads to higher transit cost, there is confusion and consternation over the scale of the fees charged and the effectiveness of their communication,<ref name=\"CABcouriers\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cas.org.uk/news/3000-angry-scots-respond-cab-survey-rural-delivery-charges|title=3,000 angry Scots respond to CAB survey on rural delivery charges |date=25 January 2012 |publisher=2012 [[The Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux]] \u2013 Citizens Advice Scotland (Scottish charity SC016637) |accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref> and the use of the word Mainland in their justification. Since the charges are often based on postcode areas, many far less remote areas, including some which are traditionally considered part of the lowlands, are also subject to these charges.<ref name=\"CABcouriers\"/> [[Royal Mail]] is the only delivery network bound by a Universal Service Obligation to charge a uniform tariff across the UK. This, however, applies only to mail items and not larger packages which are dealt with by its [[Parcelforce]] division.\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Liathach from Beinn Eighe.jpg|thumb|[[Liathach]] seen from [[Beinn Eighe]].

This part of Scotland is largely composed of ancient rocks from the [[Cambrian]] and [[Precambrian]] periods which were [[Tectonic uplift|uplifted]] during the later [[Caledonian Orogeny]]. Smaller formations of [[Lewisian complex|Lewisian gneiss]] in the northwest are up to 3&nbsp;billion years old. The overlying rocks of the [[Torridonian|Torridon Sandstone]] form mountains in the [[Torridon Hills]] such as [[Liathach]] and [[Beinn Eighe]] in [[Wester Ross]].\n\nThese foundations are interspersed with many [[igneous]] intrusions of a more recent age, the remnants of which have formed mountain [[massif]]s such as the [[Cairngorms]] and the [[Cuillin]] of [[Skye]]. A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of [[Old Red Sandstone]] found principally along the [[Moray Firth]] coast and partially down the Highland Boundary Fault. The [[Jurassic]] beds found in isolated locations on [[Skye]] and [[Applecross]] reflect the complex underlying geology. They are the original source of much [[North Sea oil]]. The [[Great Glen]] is formed along a [[transform fault]] which divides the [[Grampian Mountains]] to the southeast from the [[Northwest Highlands]].<ref name=Keay>{{cite book |author=John Keay, Julia Keay |title=Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland |url=https://archive.org/details/collinsencyclopa00john |url-access=registration |year=1994 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=9780007103539 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=William Hutchison Murray |title=The islands of Western Scotland: the Inner and Outer Hebrides |year=1973 |publisher=Eyre Methuen |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nThe entire region was covered by ice sheets during the [[Pleistocene]] ice ages, save perhaps for a few [[nunatak]]s. The complex [[geomorphology]] includes incised valleys and [[loch]]s carved by the action of mountain streams and ice, and a [[topography]] of irregularly distributed mountains whose summits have similar heights above sea-level, but whose bases depend upon the amount of [[denudation]] to which the plateau has been subjected in various places.\n\n==Places of interest==\n{{div col |colwidth=18em}}\n* [[An Teallach]]\n* [[Aonach M\u00f2r]] (Nevis Range ski centre)\n* [[Arrochar Alps]]\n* [[Balmoral Castle]]\n* [[Balquhidder]]\n* [[Battlefield of Culloden]]\n* [[Beinn Alligin]]\n* [[Beinn Eighe]]\n* [[Ben Cruachan hydro-electric power station]]\n* [[Ben Lomond]]\n* [[Ben Macdui]] (second highest mountain in Scotland and UK)\n* [[Ben Nevis]] (highest mountain in Scotland and UK)\n* [[Cairngorms National Park]]\n* [[Cairngorm Mountain ski resort|Cairngorm Ski centre]] near [[Aviemore]]\n* [[Cairngorm Mountains]]\n* [[Caledonian Canal]]\n* [[Cape Wrath]]\n* [[Carrick Castle]]\n* [[Castle Stalker]]\n* [[Castle Tioram]]\n* [[Chanonry Point]]\n* [[Conic Hill]]\n* [[Culloden Moor]]\n* [[Dunadd]]\n* [[Duart Castle]]\n* [[Durness]]\n* [[Eilean Donan]]\n* [[Fingal's Cave]] ([[Staffa]])\n* [[Fort George, Scotland|Fort George]]\n* [[Glen Coe]]\n* [[Glen Etive]]\n* [[Glen Kinglas]]\n* [[Glen Lyon, Scotland|Glen Lyon]]\n* [[Glen Orchy]]\n* [[Glenshee Ski Centre]]\n* [[Glen Shiel]]\n* [[Glen Spean]]\n* [[Glenfinnan]] (and its [[Glenfinnan railway station|railway station]] and [[Glenfinnan Viaduct|viaduct]])\n* [[Grampian Mountains]]\n* [[Hebrides]]\n* [[Highland Folk Museum]] \u2013 The first open-air museum in the UK.\n* [[Highland Wildlife Park]]\n* [[Inveraray Castle]]\n* [[Inveraray Jail]]\n* [[Inverness Castle]]\n* [[Inverewe Garden]]\n* [[Iona Abbey]]\n* [[Isle of staffa]]\n* [[Kilchurn Castle]]\n* [[Kilmartin Glen]]\n* [[Liathach]]\n* [[Lecht Ski Centre]]\n* [[Loch Alsh]]\n* [[Loch Ard]]\n* [[Loch Awe]]\n* [[Loch Earn]]\n* [[Loch Etive]]\n* [[Loch Fyne]]\n* [[Loch Goil]]\n* [[Loch Katrine]]\n* [[Loch Leven (Highlands)|Loch Leven]]\n* [[Loch Linnhe]]\n* [[Loch Lochy]]\n* [[Loch Lomond]]\n* [[Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park]]\n* [[Loch Lubnaig]]\n* [[Loch Maree]]\n* [[Loch Morar]]\n* [[Loch Morlich]]\n* [[Loch Ness]]\n* [[Loch Nevis]]\n* [[Loch Rannoch]]\n* [[Loch Tay]]\n* [[Lochranza]]\n* [[Luss]]\n* [[Meall a' Bhuiridh]] (Glencoe Ski Centre)\n* Scottish [[Sea Life Centres#United Kingdom|Sea Life Sanctuary]] at [[Loch Creran]]\n* [[Rannoch Moor]]\n* [[Cuillin#The Red Hills|Red Cuillin]]\n* [[A83 road#Rest and be Thankful|Rest and Be Thankful]] stretch of A83\n* [[River Carron, Wester Ross]]\n* [[River Spey]]\n* [[River Tay]]\n* [[Ross and Cromarty]]\n* [[Smoo Cave]]\n* [[Stob Coire a' Ch\u00e0irn]]\n* [[Stac Polly]]\n* [[Strathspey Railway (preserved)|Strathspey Railway]]\n* [[Sutherland]]\n* [[Tor Castle]]\n* [[Torridon Hills]]\n* [[Urquhart Castle]]\n* [[West Highland Line]] (scenic railway)\n* [[West Highland Way]] (Long-distance footpath)\n* [[Wester Ross]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallery cleanup}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nN2 glenfinnan viaduct.jpg|The [[Glenfinnan Viaduct]] from below.\nSaddle and sgurr na sgine 06-07 086.jpg|[[The Saddle]]\nLoch Scavaig, Skye.jpg|Loch Scavaig, [[Isle of Skye]]\nInverness Ness Footbridge 15760.JPG|[[Inverness]]\nLoch Maree.jpg|The islands of [[Loch Maree]]\nSmoo Cave-Second Chamber.jpg|The interior of [[Smoo Cave]], Sutherland\nCape Wrath lighthouse.jpg|[[Cape Wrath]] Lighthouse in the far NW of the Highlands\nBlaven geograph.jpg|[[Blaven]]\nLoch Gairloch.jpg|[[Gair Loch]]\nKyle of Durness.jpg|The Kyle of [[Durness]]\n2001-ScotlandHighlands-TheQuirang2.jpg|The [[Quiraing|Quirang]], [[Isle of Skye]]\nCervus elaphus highlands.JPG|Two hinds in the Highlands\nLoch an L\u00f2in from the west.jpg|Loch an L\u00f2in\nHighland Cattle on Orms\u00f6.jpg|[[Highland Cattle]] originates from the Scottish Highlands\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Scottish Highlands}}\n* [[Fauna of Scotland]]\n* [[Highland 2007]]\n* [[James Hunter (historian)]], historian who wrote several books related to the Scottish Highlands\n* [[List of fauna of the Scottish Highlands]]\n* [[List of towns and villages in the Scottish Highlands]]\n* [[Mountains and hills of Scotland]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Baxter, Colin, and C.
