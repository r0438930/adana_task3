{"title_page": "Music of Brazil", "text_new": "{{short description|Music and musical traditions of Brazil}}\n{{Culture of Brazil}}\n\nThe '''music of Brazil''' encompasses various regional musical styles influenced by African, European and [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] forms. Brazilian music developed some unique and original styles such as [[forr\u00f3]], [[repente]], [[coco de roda]], [[ax\u00e9]], [[sertanejo music|sertanejo]], [[samba]], [[bossa nova]], [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira|MPB]], [[Brazilian gaucho music|m\u00fasica nativista]], [[pagode]], [[tropic\u00e1lia]], [[choro]], [[maracatu]], embolada (coco de repente), [[funk carioca]], [[frevo]], [[brega (music)|brega]], [[modinha]] and Brazilian versions of foreign musical styles, such as [[Rock music|rock]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[hip-hop]], [[disco music]], [[country music]], [[Ambient music|ambient]], [[Industrial music|industrial]] and [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] music, [[Rapping|rap]], [[classical music]], [[fado]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]].\n\nSamba has become the best known form of Brazilian music worldwide, especially because of the country's [[brazilian carnival|carnival]], although [[bossa nova]], which had [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]] as one of its most acclaimed composers and performers, have received much attention abroad since the 1950s, when the song \"[[Desafinado]]\", interpreted by [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]], was first released.\n\nThe first four winners of the Shell Brazilian Music prize<ref>{{cite web|title=Pr\u00eamio Shell de M\u00fasica \u2013 Shell Brasil|url=http://www.shell.com/bra/environment-society/brazil-social-investments/music-awards.html|accessdate=13 February 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224022549/http://www.shell.com/bra/environment-society/brazil-social-investments/music-awards.html|archivedate=24 February 2014}}</ref> have each left a legacy on Brazilian music and are among the representatives of Brazilian popular music: [[Pixinguinha]] (choro), [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]] (bossa nova), [[Dorival Caymmi]] (samba and samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o).\n\nInstrumental music is also largely practiced in Brazil, with styles ranging from [[Classical music|classical]] to [[Popular music|popular]] and [[jazz]] influenced forms. Among the later, [[Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos]], [[Pixinguinha]], [[Hermeto Pascoal]] and [[Egberto Gismonti]] are significant figures. Notable classical composers include [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes|Carlos Gomes]] and [[Cl\u00e1udio Santoro]]. The country also has a growing community of modern/experimental composition, including [[electroacoustic music]].\n\n== Art music ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nLittle is known of the music of Brazil before the area's first encounter with Portuguese explorers on 22 April 1500. During the colonial period, documents detail the musical activities of the major Roman Catholic cathedrals and the parlors of the upper classes, but data about musical life outside these domains are sparse. Some information is available in writings left by such travellers as [[Jean de L\u00e9ry]], who lived in Brazil from 1557 to 1558 and produced the first known transcriptions of native American music: two chants of the Tupinamb\u00e1, near Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Olsen|first1=D.A. |last2=Sheehy |first2=D.E. |date=1998 |title=Brazil:Central and Southern Areas in Garland Encyclopedia of World Music Volume 2 |trans-title= |url=https://search-alexanderstreet-com.dclibrary.idm.oclc.org/view/work/bibliographic_entity%7Creference_article%7C1000223340#page/320/mode/1/chapter/bibliographic_entity%7Creference_article%7C1000223481 |url-status=live |format=digital |language=english |location=Retrieved from Music Online: The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music database |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415994047 |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |quote=}}</ref>\n\nFurther registration of musical activity in Brazil came from the activities of two [[Jesuit]] priests in 1549. Ten years later, they had already founded settlements for indigenous people (the ''[[Jesuit reduction|Redu\u00e7\u00f5es]]''), with a musical-educational structure.\n\nOne century later, the Redu\u00e7\u00f5es of the southern Brazil, which were founded by Spaniard Jesuits, had a strong cultural development, where some music schools were founded. Some of the reports of that time show the fascination of the indigenous people for European music.<ref>apud Padre Noel Berthold, in: \"Trevisan, Armindo\", in ''A Escultura dos Sete Povos''. Bras\u00edlia: Editora Movimento / Instituto Nacional do Livro, 1978. (Portuguese)</ref> The indigenous people also took part in the music, with both the construction of musical instruments and practice of vocal and instrumental performance.\n\n=== The 18th-century school ===\n[[File:OuroPreto1-CCBYSA.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ouro Preto]], in [[Minas Gerais]]: one of the most important musical centers in Brazil during the 18th century]]\nIn the 18th century, there was intense musical activity in all the more developed regions of Brazil, with their moderately stable institutional and educational structures. The previously few private orchestras became more common and the churches presented a great variety of music.\n\nIn the first half of this century, the most outstanding works were composed by [[Lu\u00eds \u00c1lvares Pinto]], [[Caetano de Mello de Jesus]] and [[Ant\u00f4nio Jos\u00e9 da Silva]] (\"the Jew\"), who became successful in [[Lisbon]] writing [[libretto]]s for comedies, which were performed also in Brazil with music by  [[Ant\u00f3nio Teixeira]].\n\nIn the second part of the 18th century, there was a great flourishing in [[Minas Gerais]], mostly in the regions of ''Vila Rica'' (currently [[Ouro Preto]]), [[Mariana, Minas Gerais|Mariana]] and ''Arraial do Tejuco'' (currently [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]]), where the mining of gold and diamonds for the Portuguese metropolis attracted a sizable population. At this time, the first outstanding Brazilian composers were revealed, most of them [[mulatto]]es. The musical pieces were mostly sacred music. Some of the noteworthy composers of this period were [[Jos\u00e9 Joaquim Emerico Lobo de Mesquita|Lobo de Mesquita]], [[Manoel Dias de Oliveira]], [[Francisco Gomes da Rocha]], [[Marcos Coelho Neto]] and [[Marcos Coelho Neto Filho]]. All of them were very active, but in many cases few pieces have survived until the present day. Some of the most famous pieces of this period are the ''Magnificat'' by Manoel Dias de Oliveira and the ''Our Lady's Antiphon'' by Lobo de Mesquita. In the city of Arraial do Tejuco, nowadays [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]], there were ten conductors in activity. In [[Ouro Preto]] about 250 musicians were active, and in all of the territory of Minas Gerais almost a thousand musicians were active.<ref>Mariz, Vasco. ''Hist\u00f3ria da M\u00fasica no Brasil''. Rio de Janeiro: Nova Fronteira, 2005. 6\u00aa ed. (Portuguese)</ref>\n\nWith the impoverishment of the mines at the end of the century, the focus of the musical activity changed to other centers, specially [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], where [[Andr\u00e9 da Silva Gomes]], a composer of Portuguese origin, released a great number of works and dynamized the musical life of the city.\n\n=== The Classical period ===\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Nunes Garcia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Nunes Garcia]]]]\nA crucial factor for the changes in the musical life was the arrival of the Portuguese Royal family to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1808. Until then, Rio de Janeiro was musically similar to other cultural centers of Brazil but was even less important than Minas Gerais. The presence of the Portuguese Royal family, in exile, radically changed this situation, as the [[Capela Real of Rio de Janeiro]] was established.\n\nThe king [[John VI of Portugal]] brought with him to Brazil the great musical library from the [[House of Bragan\u00e7a]], one of the best of Europe at that time, and ordered the arrival of musicians from [[Lisbon]] and the ''[[castrati]]'' from [[Italy]], re-ordering the Royal Chapel. Later, John VI ordered the construction of a sumptuous theater, called the Royal Theater of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o. The secular music had the presence of [[Marcos Portugal]], who was designated as the official composer of the household, and of [[Sigismund von Neukomm]], who contributed with his own work and brought the works of the Austrian composers [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Joseph Haydn]]. The works of these composers strongly influenced the Brazilian music of this time.\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Nunes Garcia]], the first of the great Brazilian composers, emerged at this time. With a large culture for his origin \u2013 he was poor and mulatto \u2013 he was one of the founders of the [[Irmandade de Santa Cec\u00edlia]], in Rio de Janeiro, teacher and [[mestre de capela]] of the Royal Chapel during the presence of John VI in Brazil. Nunes Garcia was the most prolific Brazilian composer of this time. He also composed the first opera written in Brazil, ''Le Due Gemelle'' (''The Two Twins''), with text in Italian, but the music is now lost.\n\nOther important composers of this period are [[Gabriel Fernandes da Trindade]], who composed the only Brazilian [[chamber music]] from the 19th century which has survived to the present times,<ref>'''Castagna, Paulo.''' Encarte do CD ''Gabriel Fernandes da Trindade \u2013 Duetos Concertantes''. S\u00e3o Paulo: Paulus, 1995. (Portuguese)</ref> and [[Jo\u00e3o de Deus de Castro Lobo]], who lived in the cities of Mariana and Ouro Preto, which were decadent at this time.\n\nThis period, however, was brief. In 1821, John VI went back to Lisbon, taking with him the household, and the cultural life in Rio de Janeiro became empty. And, despite the love of [[Peter I of Brazil]] for the music \u2013 he was also author of some musical pieces like the [[Brazilian Independence Anthem]] \u2013 the difficult financial situation didn't allow many luxuries. The conflagration of the Royal Theater in 1824 was another symbol of decadence, which reached the most critical point when Peter I renounced the throne, going back to Portugal.\n\n=== The Romantic period ===\n[[File:Carlos Gomes (fototipia).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes]]]]\nThe only composer who had a relevant work in this period was [[Francisco Manuel da Silva]], disciple of Nunes Garcia, who succeeded him as kapellmeister. In spite of his few resources, he founded the Musical Conservatory of Rio de Janeiro. He was the author of the [[Brazilian National Anthem]]'s melody. His work reflected the musical transition for the [[Romanticism]], when the interest of the national composers was focused in the [[opera]]. The most outstanding Brazilian composer of this period was [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes]], who composed Italian-styled operas with national themes, such as ''[[Il Guarany]]'' (based on [[Jos\u00e9 de Alencar]]'s novel ''[[The Guarani|O Guarani]]'') and ''[[Lo Schiavo]]''. These operas were very successful in European theaters, like the [[Teatro alla Scala]], in [[Milan]]. Other important composer of this time is [[Elias \u00c1lvares Lobo]], who wrote the opera ''[[A Noite de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o]]'', the first Brazilian opera with text in Portuguese.\n\nThe opera in Brazil was very popular until the middle of the 20th century, and many opera houses were built at this time, like [[Teatro Amazonas]] in [[Manaus]], [[Teatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Municipal Theater of Rio de Janeiro]], [[Theatro Municipal (S\u00e3o Paulo)|Municipal Theater of S\u00e3o Paulo]] do Rio, and many others.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the greatest composers for the symphonic music were revealed. One of the most outstanding name of this period was [[Leopoldo Miguez]], who followed the [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] style and [[Henrique Oswald]], who incorporated elements of the French [[Impressionism]].\n\n=== Nationalism ===\n[[File:Heitor Vila-Lobos (c. 1922).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Heitor Villa-Lobos]]]]\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, there was a movement for creating an authentically Brazilian music, with less influences of the European culture. In this sense, the [[folklore]] was the major font of inspiration for the composers. Some composers like [[Bras\u00edlio Itiber\u00ea da Cunha]], [[Luciano Gallet]] and [[Alexandre Levy]], despite having a European formation, included some typically Brazilian elements in their works. This trend reached the highest point with [[Alberto Nepomuceno]], who used largely the rhythms and melodies from the Brazilian folklore.\n\nAn important event, later, was the [[Modern Art Week]], in 1922, which had a large impact on concepts of national art. In this event the composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], regarded as the most outstanding name of the Brazilian nationalism, was revealed.\n\nVilla-Lobos did researches about the musical folklore of Brazil, and mixed elements both from classical and popular music. He explored many musical genres such as [[concerto]]s, [[symphony|symphonies]], [[modinha]]s, [[Fado]]s, and other symphonic, vocal and chamber music. Some of his masterworks are the ballet ''[[Uirapuru (Villa-Lobos)|Uirapuru]]'' and the two series of ''[[Ch\u00f4ros]]'' and ''[[Bachianas Brasileiras]]''.\n\nOther composers of Brazilian national music of this era include [[Oscar Lorenzo Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Radam\u00e9s Gnattali]], [[Camargo Guarnieri]], [[Osvaldo Lacerda]], [[Francisco Mignone]], and [[Ernesto Nazareth]].\n\n=== The avant-garde movement ===\n{{see also|Tropicalia}}\nAs a reaction against the nationalist school, who was identified as \"servile\" to the centralizing politics of [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], in 1939 the ''Movimento M\u00fasica Viva'' (Living Music Movement) appeared, led by [[Hans Joachim Koellreutter]] and by [[Eg\u00eddio de Castro e Silva]], defending the adoption of an international style, derived from the [[dodecaphonism]] of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. This group was integrated by composers like [[Cl\u00e1udio Santoro]], [[C\u00e9sar Guerra-Peixe]], [[Eunice Catunda]] and [[Edino Krieger]]. Koellreutter adopted revolutionary methodes, in respect to the individuality of each student and giving to the students the freedom of creativity before the knowledge of the traditional rules for composition. The movement edited a magazine and presented a series of [[radio]] programs showing their fundaments and works of contemporary music. Later, Guerra-Peixe and Santoro followed an independent way, centered in the regional music. Other composers, who used freely the previous styles were [[Marlos Nobre]], [[Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio Rezende de Almeida Prado|Almeida Prado]], and [[Armando Albuquerque]], who created their own styles.\n\nAfter 1960, the Brazilian avant-garde movement received a new wave, focusing on [[serial music]], [[microtonal music]], [[concrete music]] and [[electronic music]], employing a completely new language. This movement was called ''M\u00fasica Nova'' (New Music) and was led by [[Gilberto Mendes]] and [[Willy Corr\u00eaa de Oliveira]].\n\n=== Brazilian Opera ===\n[[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes|Carlos Gomes]] was the first composer on non-European origin to achieve wide recognition in the classical music environment of the Golden age of Opera in Italy. [[Bossa Nova]] was created as anti-opera in a time when opera seemed to represent the art-form of the elite. [5] In recent years the style has been revived with works by [[Jorge Antunes (composer)|Jorge Antunes]], [[Flo Menezes]], and others.\n\nSince 2014 the [[International Brazilian Opera (IBOC)]] has been producing new works, most notably by its Artistic Director and resident composer [[Joao MacDowell]].\n\n=== Contemporary ===\nNowadays, Brazilian music follows the guidelines of both experimentalism and traditional music. Some of the contemporary Brazilian composers are [[Amaral Vieira]], [[S\u00edlvio Ferraz]], [[Flo Menezes]], [[Marcos Balter]], [[Alexandre Lunsqui]], [[Rodolfo Caesar]], [[Felipe Lara]], [[Edson Zampronha]], [[Marcus Siqueira]], [http://www.rodrigolimacomposer.com/ Rodrigo Lima], [[Jorge Antunes (composer)|Jorge Antunes]], [[Roberto Victorio]] and [[Jo\u00e3o MacDowell]]. From the new generation of Brazilian composers, [[Caio Fac\u00f3]] has achieved international recognition for his work.\n\nBrazil has a large number of internationally recognized orchestras and performers, despite the relatively low support of the government. The most famous Brazilian orchestra is probably the [[Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo State Symphony Orchestra]], currently under conductor [[Thierry Fischer]]. Other Brazilian orchestras worthy of note are the [[Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo University Symphony]], the [[Brazilian Symphony Orchestra|Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica Brasileira]], Orquestra Filarm\u00f4nica de Minas Gerais and the [[Petrobras Sinf\u00f4nica]], supported by the Brazilian state oil company [[Petrobras]].\n\nThere are also regular operas scheduled every year in cities such as [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The [[state of S\u00e3o Paulo]] also hosts the Winter Festival in the city of [[Campos do Jord\u00e3o]].\n\nSome of the most famous Brazilian conductors are  [[Roberto Minczuk]], [[John Neschling]] and [[Isaac Karabtchevsky]]. The instrumentalists include, among others: [[Roberto Szidon]], [[Antonio Meneses]], [[Cussy de Almeida]], [[Gilberto Tinetti]], [[Arnaldo Cohen]], [[Nelson Freire]], [[Eud\u00f3xia de Barros]], [[Guiomar Novaes]] and [[Magda Tagliaferro]]. And some of the most famous Brazilian singers were, historically, [[Zola Amaro]], [[Constantina Ara\u00fajo]] and [[Bidu Say\u00e3o]]; living singers include [[Eliane Coelho]], [[Kismara Pessatti]], [[Maria L\u00facia Godoy]], [[Sebasti\u00e3o Teixeira]], and others.\n\nIn the 1980s, a wave of Brazilian heavy metal bands gained public attention. The most commercially successful of these was [[Sepultura]], founded in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1983, preceded by [[Dorsal Atlantica]] and followed by [[Sarcofago]].\n\nThe intrusion of alien elements into Brazil's cultural system is not a destructive process. The return of a democratic government allowed for freedom of expression. The Brazilian music industry opened up to international styles and this has allowed for both foreign and local genres to co-exist and identify people. Each different style relates to the people socially, politically, and economically. \"Brazil is a regionally divided country with a rich cultural and musical diversity among states. As such, musicians in the country choose to define their local heritage differently depending on where they come from.\" This shows how globalization has not robbed Brazil of its identity but instead given it the ability to represent its people both in Brazil and the rest of the world.\n\nIn recent years Brazilian artists have become more interested in Africa, the Caribbean and their own indigenous and folk music. While there are some artists who continue to perform rock and Western pop, there are now just as many contemporaries playing a fusion of African and European influences with those from across The Americas. Some artists have even become influenced by Asian music, noticing some parallels between music from the North-East of Brazil and music from India.\n\n== Indigenous and folk music ==\nThe native peoples of the Brazilian [[rainforest]] play instruments including [[whistle]]s, [[flute]]s, [[French horn|horn]]s, [[drum (musical instrument)|drum]]s and [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s.  Much of the area's folk music imitates the sounds of the [[Amazon Rainforest]].  When the Portuguese arrived in Brazil, the first natives they met played an array of reed [[flute]]s and other [[wind instrument|wind]] and [[percussion instrument]]s.  The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[missionary|missionaries]] introduced songs which used the [[Tupi language]] with Christian lyrics, an attempt to convert the people to Christianity,<ref>[http://www.fmpsd.ab.ca/schools/df/Brazil/mmusic.htm Music]. Fmpsd.ab.ca. Retrieved on 2011-11-23. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310092423/http://www.fmpsd.ab.ca/schools/df/Brazil/mmusic.htm |date=March 10, 2005 }}</ref> and also introduced [[Gregorian chant]] and the flute, [[bow (musical instrument)|bow]], and the [[clavichord]].\n\n[[File:Ilus Abertura Religiosa.jpg|thumb|right|Drum known as Il\u00fa used in Xamb\u00e1 religion in Pernambuco]]\nThe earliest music in what is now Brazil must have been that of the native peoples of the area.  Little is known about their music, since no written records exist of this era.  With the arrival of Europeans, Brazilian culture began to take shape as a synthesis of native musical styles with Portuguese music and African music.\n[[File:Negro fandango scene.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jongo]], a dance and musical genre of African origin, c. 1822]]\n[[File:Rugendas lundu 1835.jpg|thumb|Brazilian dance-song ''[[Lundu (dance)|lundu]]'', c. 1835]]\n\n=== Capoeira music ===\n{{main|Capoeira music}}\n\n[[File:Capoeira-three-berimbau-one-pandeiro.jpg|thumb|right|Three berimbau players]]\nThe [[Afro-Brazilian]] sport of [[capoeira]] is never played without its own music, which is usually considered to be a call-and-response type of folk music. The main instruments of capoeira music include the ''[[berimbau]]'', the ''[[atabaque]]'' and the ''[[pandeiro]]''. [[Capoeira songs]] may be improvised on the spot, or they may be popular songs written by older, and ancient ''mestres'' (teachers), and often include accounts of the history of capoeira, or the doings of great mestres.\n\n=== Maracatu ===\n{{main|Maracatu}}\n\n[[File:Caboclos de lan\u00e7a.jpg|thumb|Maracatu.]]\nThis type of music is played primarily in the [[Recife]] and [[Olinda]] regions during Carnaval. It is an [[Afro-Brazilian]] tradition. The music serves as the backdrop for parade groups that evolved out of ceremonies conducted during colonial times in honour of the Kings of Congo, who were African slaves occupying symbolic leadership positions among the slave population. The music is played on large [[alfaia]] drums, large metal gongu\u00ea bells, snare drums and shakers.  An important variant is found in and around Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1 (called maracatu cearense), which is different from the Recife/Olinda tradition in many respects: triangles are used instead of gongu\u00eas, [[surdo]]s or [[zabumba]]s instead of alfaias.  Also, important female characters are performed by cross-dressed male performers, and all African and Afrobrazilian personages are performed using blackface makeup.\n\n=== Afox\u00e9 ===\n{{main|Afox\u00e9}}\n\nAfox\u00e9 is the name given to a group dedicated to playing ijex\u00e1, which is a kind of [[religious music]], part of the [[Candombl\u00e9]] tradition.  In 1949, a group called [[Filhos de Gandhi]] began playing afox\u00e9 during [[Brazilian Carnival|carnaval]] parades in Salvador; their name translates as ''Sons of Gandhi'', associating black Brazilian activism with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s Indian independence movement.  The Filhos de Gandhi's 1949 appearance was also revolutionary because, until then, the Carnaval parades in Salvador were meant only for light-skinned people.\n\n=== Repente ===\n[[File:De repente, um repentista! (165251858).jpg|thumb|Repentista.]]\n[[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]] is known for a distinctive form of literature called [[cordel literature|literatura de cordel]], which are a type of [[ballad]]s that include elements incorporated into music as \"[[repentismo]]\", an improvised lyrical contest on themes suggested by the audience.\n\nSimilar to Repentismo, appears among the [[Caipira]] culture a musical form derived from [[viola caipira]], which is called ''cururu''.\n\n== Popular music ==\n\n=== Choro ===\n{{main|Choro}}\n[[File:Violao choro.jpg|thumb|left|Choro guitar.]]\n{{Listen|filename=Pixinguinha- O Urubu e o Gaviao 1930.ogg|title=Urubu Malandro|description=\"Urubu Malandro\", recorded in 1930 by Pixinguinha in the flute}}\n{{Listen|filename=003-harmonia_selvagem_-_dante_santoro_1938.ogg|title=Harmonia Selvagem|description=Choro \"Harmonia Selvagem\" composed by Dante Santoro.

Instrumental, its origins are in 19th century Rio de Janeiro. Originally ''choro'' was played by a trio of flute, guitar and cavaquinho (a small chordophone with four strings). The young pianist [[Ernesto Nazareth]] published his first choro (''N\u00e3o Caio Noutra'') in 1878 at the age of 14.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070709135551/http://www.bn.br/fbn/musica/enzinfa.htm Childhood Secrets *]. bn.br</ref> Nazareth's choros are often listed as ''polkas'';<ref>[http://www.chiquinhagonzaga.com/nazareth/ Ernesto Nazareth \u2013 Rei do Choro].

[[Chiquinha Gonzaga]] composed her first success, the polka-choro \"Atraente\", in 1877.

The mainstream success of this style of music (By the 1930s) came from the early days of radio, when bands performed live on the air. By the 1950s and 1960s it was replaced by [[samba]] and [[Bossa Nova]] and other styles of Brazilian popular music, but was still alive in amateur circles called \"rodas de choro\" (informal choro gatherings in residences and [[botecos]]). However, in the late 1970s there was a successful effort to revitalize the genre carried out by some famous artists: [[Pixinguinha]], [[Waldir Azevedo]] and [[Jacob do Bandolim]].\n\n=== Samba ===\n{{main|Samba}}\n[[File:Carmen Miranda 1941.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Singer and actress [[Carmen Miranda]].]]\nIn 1929, prompted by the opening of the first radio station in Rio de Janeiro, the so-called ''radio era'' began spreading songs \u2013 especially the novelty Samba in its current format \u2013 to larger masses. This period was dominated by few male interpreters \u2013 notably Almirante, [[Braguinha (composer)|Braguinha]], [[M\u00e1rio Reis]], [[S\u00edlvio Caldas]], [[Francisco Alves]] and singer/composer [[Noel Rosa]] and even fewer chanteuses such as [[Aracy de Almeida]] and sisters [[Aurora Miranda]] and [[Carmen Miranda]], who eventually came to [[Hollywood]] becoming a movie star.<ref>[http://veja.abril.com.br/110407/p_120.shtml A na\u00e7\u00e3o das cantoras].

Noteworthy Samba composers at this early stage included said [[Noel Rosa]] plus [[Lamartine Babo]] and, around [[World War II]] time, [[Ary Barroso]].\n\n=== MPB (Popular Brazilian Music) ===\n{{main|M\u00fasica popular brasileira}}\n[[File:Brazil.GilbertoGil.01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gilberto Gil]]]]\n\nMPB's early stage (from World War II to the mid-1960s) was populated by male singers such as Orlando Silva, [[Nelson Gon\u00e7alves]], [[Jamel\u00e3o]], [[Agostinho dos Santos]], [[An\u00edsio Silva]], Ataulfo Alves, [[Carlos Galhardo]], [[Ciro Monteiro]], [[Ismael Silva]], [[Jo\u00e3o Dias]], [[Jorge Goulart]], [[Miltinho]], [[Jorge Veiga]] and [[Francisco Eg\u00eddio]] and female singers started to mushroom: [[Nora Ney]], [[Dolores Duran]], [[\u00c2ngela Maria]], [[Emilinha Borba]], Marlene, [[Dalva de Oliveira]], [[Maysa Matarazzo]], sisters [[Linda Batista]] and [[Dircinha Batista]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nMPB's second stage \u2013 after the split [[Bossa Nova]] (1959) / [[Jovem Guarda]] (1965) / [[Tropicalismo]] (both 1967) \u2013 refers to mainstream Brazilian pop music. Well-known MPB artists include, among many others, singers such as [[Elis Regina]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Nara Le\u00e3o]], [[Maria Beth\u00e2nia]], [[M\u00f4nica da Silva]], [[Simone Bittencourt de Oliveira|Simone]], [[Chico Buarque]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]], [[Jorge Ben Jor]], [[Milton Nascimento]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Jo\u00e3o Bosco]], [[Ivan Lins]], [[Djavan]].\n\n=== Bossa nova ===\n{{main|Bossa nova}}\nThe first [[bossa nova]] records by [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]], in the last years of the 1950s, quickly became huge hits in Brazil. [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]] and other [[composer]]s helped further develop this fusion of [[jazz]] harmonies and a smoother, often slower, samba beat, which developed at the beach neighborhoods of [[Ipanema]] and, later, the [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]] nightclubs. Bossa nova was introduced to the rest of the world by American jazz musicians in the early 1960s, and song \"[[The Girl from Ipanema]]\" remains probably the best known Brazilian musical export, eventually becoming a jazz standard.\n\n=== Brazilian gospel ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}\n[[File:Diante do Trono - Grava\u00e7\u00e3o Creio.jpg|thumb|left|[[Diante do Trono]], the main worship ministry in Latin America.]]\n[[Gospel music]] emerged in Brazil before the 1960s with hymnals that were brought and translated into Portuguese by American missionaries. From the late 1960s the first singers of Christian music groups emerged in Brazil, but the songs were not highly valued. Gospel music became popular in Brazil in the late 1990s, with the emergence of congregational singing and bands such as [[Diante do Trono]], led by [[Ana Paula Valad\u00e3o]]. Diante do Trono has become the largest [[contemporary worship music]] ministry in Latin America.\n\n=== Brazilian rock ===\n{{main|Brazilian rock|samba rock}}\n[[File:Rita Lee in Aracatuba-08, by Marco Senche.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rita Lee]]]]\nThe musical style known in Brazil as \"Brazilian [[rock n' roll]]\" dates back to a Portuguese-version cover{{which|date=June 2014}} of \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" in 1954. In the 1960s, young singers like [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]] and the [[Jovem Guarda]] movement were very popular. The 1960s also saw the rise of bands such as the \"[[Tropicalismo|tropicalistas]]\" [[Os Mutantes]] and the experimental (mixing [[progressive rock]], [[jazz]] and [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira]]) Som Imagin\u00e1rio.\n\nThe 1970s saw the emergence of many [[progressive rock]] and/or [[hard rock]] bands such as [[O Ter\u00e7o]], [[A Bolha]], [[A Barca do Sol]], [[Som Nosso de Cada Dia]], [[V\u00edmana]] and [[Bacamarte]], some of which attained some recognition internationally; [[Rita Lee]], in her solo career after [[Os Mutantes]], championed the glam-rock aesthetics in Brazil; [[Casa das M\u00e1quinas]] and [[Patrulha do Espa\u00e7o]] were more bona-fide [[hard rock]] bands, and the likes of ([[Raul Seixas]], [[Secos & Molhados|Secos e Molhados]], [[Novos Baianos]] and [[A Cor do Som]]) mixed the genre with traditional Brazilian music. In the late 1970s, the Brazilian [[punk rock]] scene kicked off mainly in S\u00e3o Paulo and in Bras\u00edlia, booming in the 1980s, with [[Inocentes]], [[C\u00f3lera]], [[Ratos de Por\u00e3o]], [[Garotos Podres]], etc.\n\nThe real commercial boom of Brazilian rock was in the 1980s, with many bands and artists like [[Blitz (Brazilian band)|Blitz]], [[Gang 90]], [[Bar\u00e3o Vermelho]], [[Legi\u00e3o Urbana]], [[Lob\u00e3o]], [[Engenheiros do Hawaii]], [[Tit\u00e3s]], [[Kid Abelha]], [[Paralamas do Sucesso]], and many others, and festivals like [[Rock in Rio]] and [[Hollywood Rock]]. The late 1980s and early 1990s also witnessed the beginnings of an electronica-inspired scene, with a lot more limited commercial potential but achieving some critical acclaim: [[Suba (musician)|Suba]], [[Loop B]], [[Harry (Brazilian musician)|Harry]], etc.\n\n[[File:FTakai.jpg|thumb|[[Fernanda Takai]], singer [[Pato Fu]]]]\nIn the 1990s, the meteoric rise of [[Mamonas Assassinas]], which sold more than 3 million copies of its only CD (a record, by Brazilian standards) came to a tragic end when the band's plane crashed, killing all five members of the band, the pilot and the co-pilot. Other commercially successful bands included [[Jota Quest]], [[Raimundos]] and [[Skank (band)|Skank]], while [[Chico Science & Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi]] and the whole [[Mangue Bit]] movement received much critical attention and accolades, but very little commercial success \u2013 success that declined after the death of one of its founders, [[Chico Science]]. It was also in the 1990s that the first seeds of what would grow into being the Brazilian indie scene were planted, with the creation of indie festivals such as [[Abril Pro Rock]] and, later in the decade, [[Por\u00e3o do Rock]]. The band [[Pato Fu]] was considered by [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine one of the ten best bands in the world outside the United States.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000784,00.html | work=Time | first=Rhett | last=Butler | title=Best Bands: And Our Winners Are | date=September 15, 2001}}</ref> It is also known to re-record hits Brazilian and international versions of toy instruments.\n\nFemale singer [[Pitty]] is also very popular. The indie scene has been growing exponentially since the early 2000s, with more and more festivals taking place all around the country. However, due to several factors including but not limited to the worldwide collapse of the music industry, all the agitation in the indie scene has so far failed in translating into international success, but in Brazil they developed a real, substantial cultural movement. That scene is still much of a ghetto, with bands capturing the attention of international critics, but many playing again in Brazil when they become popular in the exterior, due to the lack of financial and material support which would allow for careers to be developed. One notable exception is [[CSS (band)|CSS]], an alternative [[Electronic rock|electro rock]] outfit that has launched a successful international career, performing in festivals and venues in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Other unique example of success through independent music scene that made to the mainstream is the band [[M\u00f3veis Coloniais de Acaju]]. The band has its own style, somewhere between rock and folk, and is recognized as the most important independent band in Brazil. The record company Trama [https://web.archive.org/web/20090123211659/http://trama.uol.com.br/portalv2/home/index.jsp] tries to support some bands with structure and exposure, and can be credited with early support to [[CSS (band)|CSS]] and later to M\u00f3veis Coloniais de Acaju.\n\n==== Brazilian heavy metal ====\n{{see also|Brazilian thrash metal}}\n[[File:Sepultura @ Maquin\u00e1ria Festival 02.jpg|thumb|[[Sepultura]].]]\nBrazilian [[Heavy metal music|metal]] originated in the mid 1980s with three prominent scenes: Belo Horizonte, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The most famous Brazilian metal bands are [[Sepultura]], [[Angra (band)|Angra]], [[Krisiun]], [[Rebaelliun]], [[Nephasth]], [[Dr. Sin]], [[Shaaman]], [[Violator (band)|Violator]] and the singer [[Andre Matos]]. Sepultura is considered an influential [[Brazilian thrash metal|thrash metal]] band, influencing the development of [[death metal]].\n\nFamous bands of the 1980s include [[Korzus]], [[Sarc\u00f3fago]], [[Overdose (band)|Overdose]],<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r206736|pure_url=yes}}|title=Progress of Decadence > Review|last=Jeffries|first=Vincent|work=Allmusic|publisher=Macrovision|accessdate=12 April 2009 |quote=One of the best-known, if not the premier, metal bands in Brazil, Overdose had actually released several discs during the eight years prior to ''Progress of Decadence''\u2014the group's first record to receive international distribution.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r413357|pure_url=yes}}|title=Circus of Death > Review|last=Jeffries|first=Vincent|work=Allmusic|publisher=Macrovision|accessdate=12 April 2009 |quote=On 1999's ''Circus of Death'', Brazil's second most famous metal band try again to emerge from beneath the shadow of Sepultura with their neo-prog thrash.}}</ref> [[Dorsal Atl\u00e2ntica]], [[Viper (band)|Viper]], [[MX (band)|MX]], [[PUS (band)|PUS]], [[Mutilator]], [[Chakal (band)|Chakal]], [[Vulcano (band)|Vulcano]] and [[Attomica]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p884193|pure_url=yes}}|title=Attomica > Biography|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo|work=Allmusic|publisher=Macrovision|accessdate=12 April 2009 |quote=Arriving in stores in 1991, the LP's [the band's third album, ''Disturbing the Noise''] \"ultra-speed\" style cemented Attomica's standing as one of Brazil's top thrash acts; the promo clip for single \"Deathraiser\" was showcased on several TV video shows, including the Brazilian MTV affiliate.}}</ref> Bands from the 1990s include [[Andralls]], MQN, Macaco Bong, [[Black Drawing Chalks]], Superguidis, [[Mental Hor]], [[The Mist (band)|The Mist]], [[Scars (band)|Scars]], [[Distraught]], [[Torture Squad]], [[Eterna (band)|Eterna]] and [[Silent Cry (band)|Silent Cry]].

The first to break into the mainstream was internet phenomenon [[Mallu Magalh\u00e3es]], who played covers of her favourite artists in English and her own songs in both English and Portuguese (as well as other languages).  Magalh\u00e3es only released her first album in 2008, though by then she was already widely recognised as the voice of this sudden new Brazilian folk scene.  Her ex-boyfriend [[H\u00e9lio Flanders]] is the lead singer of another Brazilian folk group called [[Vanguart]].  Though Vanguart had an album released before Mallu Magalh\u00e3es, it was her emergence that consolidated them both and others as a fully recognised mainstream scene, topping charts and being featured in prime time television and advertising.  Other acts emerged after the market was opened up to folk. Writing in English is more and more common among Brazilian rock and folk artists.  This has been highly criticised by Portuguese language purists, though it has helped to promote Brazilian artists in other countries ([[CSS (band)|CSS]] is a perfect example).  The new Brazilian folk scene has just come to the public's attention and it continues to thrive.\n[[File:Os Mutantes.tif|thumb|Os Mutantes, 1969. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]\n\n==== Brazilian psychedelic rock ====\n{{main|Mangue Bit}}\nBrazil has a long tradition of psychedelic music since artists like [[Os Mutantes]], [[Ronnie Von]] and other rock bands from the late 60s. Nowadays, there exists a revival of this psychedelic/vintage inspired music represented by artists like [[Jupiter Apple]], [[Violeta de Outono]], [[Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi]], [[Mundo Livre S/A]], [[:pt:Cidad\u00e3o Instigado|Cidad\u00e3o Instigado]], [[Otto (singer)|Otto]], China, Kassin, [[:pt:Pata de Elefante|Pata de Elefante]], [[Orquestra Abstrata]], among others.\n\n=== Sertanejo ===\n{{main|M\u00fasica sertaneja}}\n[[File:Ch&xr.jpg|thumb|[[Chit\u00e3ozinho & Xoror\u00f3]].]]\nM\u00fasica sertaneja or Sertanejo is a term for Brazilian [[country music]]. It originally referred to music originating among [[Sert\u00e3o]] and musica [[caipira]]. (Caipira music appeared in the state of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], and some the regions of [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], [[Goi\u00e1s]]  [[Minas Gerais]], [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]] and [[Mato Grosso]]. Musical rhythm is very spread out in the Southeastern and southern regions of Brazil.)\n\n=== Northeastern Music ===\n[[File:Luiz-Gonzaga-Est\u00e1tua-de-bronze.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Luiz Gonzaga]]]]\nNorth eastern music is a generic term for any popular music from the large region of Northeastern Brazil, including both coastal and inland areas.  Rhythms are slow and plodding, and are derived from [[guitar]]s instead of [[percussion instrument]]s like in the rest of Brazil\u2014in this region, African rhythms and Portuguese melodies combined to form [[maracatu]].  Most influentially, however, the area around the state of [[Pernambuco]], the home of [[frevo]] and [[maracatu]].\n\n=== [[Brazilian gaucho music|Gaucho music]] (Southern music) ===\nSouthern music ({{lang-pt|'''M\u00fasica ga\u00facha'''}}) is a general term used for the music originally from the [[Rio Grande do Sul]] state, in [[Southern Brazil]]. Some of the most famous musicians of this genre are [[Renato Borghetti]], [[Yamandu Costa]], [[Jayme Caetano Braun]] and [[Luiz Marenco]], among others.\n\n=== Music of Salvador: Late 60s to mid-70s ===\nIn the latter part of the 1960s, a group of black Bahians began dressing as [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] during the Salvadoran Carnaval, identifying with their shared struggles through history.  These groups included [[Comanches do Pel\u00f4]] and [[Apaches de Toror\u00f3]] and were known for a forceful and powerful style of percussion, and frequent violent encounters with the police.  Starting in 1974, a group of black Bahians called [[Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea]] became prominent, identifying with the [[Yoruba people]] of [[West Africa]].  Along with a policy of loosening restrictions by the Brazilian government, Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea's sound and message spread to groups like [[Olodum|Grupo Cultural do Olodum]], who established community centers and other philanthropic efforts.\n\n=== Frevo ===\n{{main|Frevo}}\n\n[[Frevo]] is a style of music from [[Olinda]] and [[Recife]]. Frevo bands always play during the Carnival.\n\n=== Sambass ===\n{{main|Sambass}}\n\nSambass is a fusion of samba and [[Drum & Bass]]. The most famous sambass musicians are [[DJ Marky]] and [[DJ Patife]] whose hit ''Sambassim'' might be the most known sambass track.\n\n=== Funk Carioca ===\n{{main|Funk Carioca}}\n\nFunk Carioca is a type of dance music from Rio de Janeiro, derived from and was until the late 1990s, superficially similar to [[Miami Bass]]. In Rio it is most often simply known as Funk, although it is very different musically from what [[Funk]] means in most other places and contexts.  Funk Carioca, like other types of hip-hop lifts heavily from samples such as international rips or from previous funk music.  Many popular funk songs sampled music from the movie ''[[Rocky]]''.<ref name=\"Funk Carioca\">{{cite web|url=http://sheepish.org/itp/funk/ |title=Funk Carioca |publisher=Sheepish.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}</ref> Funk was introduced to Brazil in a systematic way in the 1980s.

Among the later, [[Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos]], [[Pixinguinha]], [[Hermeto Pascoal]] and [[Egberto Gismonti]] are significant figures. Notable classical composers include [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes|Carlos Gomes]] and [[Cl\u00e1udio Santoro]]. The country also has a growing community of modern/experimental composition, including [[electroacoustic music]].\n\n== Art music ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nLittle is known of the music of Brazil before the area's first encounter with Portuguese explorers on 22 April 1500. During the colonial period, documents detail the musical activities of the major Roman Catholic cathedrals and the parlors of the upper classes, but data about musical life outside these domains are sparse. Some information is available in writings left by such travellers as [[Jean de L\u00e9ry]], who lived in Brazil from 1557 to 1558 and produced the first known transcriptions of native American music: two chants of the Tupinamb\u00e1, near Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Olsen|first1=D.A. |last2=Sheehy |first2=D.E. |date=1998 |title=Brazil:Central and Southern Areas in Garland Encyclopedia of World Music Volume 2 |trans-title= |url=https://search-alexanderstreet-com.dclibrary.idm.oclc.org/view/work/bibliographic_entity%7Creference_article%7C1000223340#page/320/mode/1/chapter/bibliographic_entity%7Creference_article%7C1000223481 |url-status=live |format=digital |language=english |location=Retrieved from Music Online: The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music database |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415994047 |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |quote=}}</ref>\n\nFurther registration of musical activity in Brazil came from the activities of two [[Jesuit]] priests in 1549. Ten years later, they had already founded settlements for indigenous people (the ''[[Jesuit reduction|Redu\u00e7\u00f5es]]''), with a musical-educational structure.\n\nOne century later, the Redu\u00e7\u00f5es of the southern Brazil, which were founded by Spaniard Jesuits, had a strong cultural development, where some music schools were founded. Some of the reports of that time show the fascination of the indigenous people for European music.<ref>apud Padre Noel Berthold, in: \"Trevisan, Armindo\", in ''A Escultura dos Sete Povos''. Bras\u00edlia: Editora Movimento / Instituto Nacional do Livro, 1978. (Portuguese)</ref> The indigenous people also took part in the music, with both the construction of musical instruments and practice of vocal and instrumental performance.\n\n=== The 18th-century school ===\n[[File:OuroPreto1-CCBYSA.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ouro Preto]], in [[Minas Gerais]]: one of the most important musical centers in Brazil during the 18th century]]\nIn the 18th century, there was intense musical activity in all the more developed regions of Brazil, with their moderately stable institutional and educational structures. The previously few private orchestras became more common and the churches presented a great variety of music.\n\nIn the first half of this century, the most outstanding works were composed by [[Lu\u00eds \u00c1lvares Pinto]], [[Caetano de Mello de Jesus]] and [[Ant\u00f4nio Jos\u00e9 da Silva]] (\"the Jew\"), who became successful in [[Lisbon]] writing [[libretto]]s for comedies, which were performed also in Brazil with music by  [[Ant\u00f3nio Teixeira]].\n\nIn the second part of the 18th century, there was a great flourishing in [[Minas Gerais]], mostly in the regions of ''Vila Rica'' (currently [[Ouro Preto]]), [[Mariana, Minas Gerais|Mariana]] and ''Arraial do Tejuco'' (currently [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]]), where the mining of gold and diamonds for the Portuguese metropolis attracted a sizable population. At this time, the first outstanding Brazilian composers were revealed, most of them [[mulatto]]es. The musical pieces were mostly sacred music. Some of the noteworthy composers of this period were [[Jos\u00e9 Joaquim Emerico Lobo de Mesquita|Lobo de Mesquita]], [[Manoel Dias de Oliveira]], [[Francisco Gomes da Rocha]], [[Marcos Coelho Neto]] and [[Marcos Coelho Neto Filho]]. All of them were very active, but in many cases few pieces have survived until the present day. Some of the most famous pieces of this period are the ''Magnificat'' by Manoel Dias de Oliveira and the ''Our Lady's Antiphon'' by Lobo de Mesquita. In the city of Arraial do Tejuco, nowadays [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]], there were ten conductors in activity. In [[Ouro Preto]] about 250 musicians were active, and in all of the territory of Minas Gerais almost a thousand musicians were active.<ref>Mariz, Vasco. ''Hist\u00f3ria da M\u00fasica no Brasil''. Rio de Janeiro: Nova Fronteira, 2005. 6\u00aa ed. (Portuguese)</ref>\n\nWith the impoverishment of the mines at the end of the century, the focus of the musical activity changed to other centers, specially [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], where [[Andr\u00e9 da Silva Gomes]], a composer of Portuguese origin, released a great number of works and dynamized the musical life of the city.\n\n=== The Classical period ===\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Nunes Garcia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Nunes Garcia]]]]\nA crucial factor for the changes in the musical life was the arrival of the Portuguese Royal family to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1808. Until then, Rio de Janeiro was musically similar to other cultural centers of Brazil but was even less important than Minas Gerais. The presence of the Portuguese Royal family, in exile, radically changed this situation, as the [[Capela Real of Rio de Janeiro]] was established.\n\nThe king [[John VI of Portugal]] brought with him to Brazil the great musical library from the [[House of Bragan\u00e7a]], one of the best of Europe at that time, and ordered the arrival of musicians from [[Lisbon]] and the ''[[castrati]]'' from [[Italy]], re-ordering the Royal Chapel. Later, John VI ordered the construction of a sumptuous theater, called the Royal Theater of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o. The secular music had the presence of [[Marcos Portugal]], who was designated as the official composer of the household, and of [[Sigismund von Neukomm]], who contributed with his own work and brought the works of the Austrian composers [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Joseph Haydn]]. The works of these composers strongly influenced the Brazilian music of this time.\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Nunes Garcia]], the first of the great Brazilian composers, emerged at this time. With a large culture for his origin \u2013 he was poor and mulatto \u2013 he was one of the founders of the [[Irmandade de Santa Cec\u00edlia]], in Rio de Janeiro, teacher and [[mestre de capela]] of the Royal Chapel during the presence of John VI in Brazil. Nunes Garcia was the most prolific Brazilian composer of this time. He also composed the first opera written in Brazil, ''Le Due Gemelle'' (''The Two Twins''), with text in Italian, but the music is now lost.\n\nOther important composers of this period are [[Gabriel Fernandes da Trindade]], who composed the only Brazilian [[chamber music]] from the 19th century which has survived to the present times,<ref>'''Castagna, Paulo.''' Encarte do CD ''Gabriel Fernandes da Trindade \u2013 Duetos Concertantes''. S\u00e3o Paulo: Paulus, 1995. (Portuguese)</ref> and [[Jo\u00e3o de Deus de Castro Lobo]], who lived in the cities of Mariana and Ouro Preto, which were decadent at this time.\n\nThis period, however, was brief. In 1821, John VI went back to Lisbon, taking with him the household, and the cultural life in Rio de Janeiro became empty. And, despite the love of [[Peter I of Brazil]] for the music \u2013 he was also author of some musical pieces like the [[Brazilian Independence Anthem]] \u2013 the difficult financial situation didn't allow many luxuries. The conflagration of the Royal Theater in 1824 was another symbol of decadence, which reached the most critical point when Peter I renounced the throne, going back to Portugal.\n\n=== The Romantic period ===\n[[File:Carlos Gomes (fototipia).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes]]]]\nThe only composer who had a relevant work in this period was [[Francisco Manuel da Silva]], disciple of Nunes Garcia, who succeeded him as kapellmeister. In spite of his few resources, he founded the Musical Conservatory of Rio de Janeiro. He was the author of the [[Brazilian National Anthem]]'s melody. His work reflected the musical transition for the [[Romanticism]], when the interest of the national composers was focused in the [[opera]]. The most outstanding Brazilian composer of this period was [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes]], who composed Italian-styled operas with national themes, such as ''[[Il Guarany]]'' (based on [[Jos\u00e9 de Alencar]]'s novel ''[[The Guarani|O Guarani]]'') and ''[[Lo Schiavo]]''. These operas were very successful in European theaters, like the [[Teatro alla Scala]], in [[Milan]]. Other important composer of this time is [[Elias \u00c1lvares Lobo]], who wrote the opera ''[[A Noite de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o]]'', the first Brazilian opera with text in Portuguese.\n\nThe opera in Brazil was very popular until the middle of the 20th century, and many opera houses were built at this time, like [[Teatro Amazonas]] in [[Manaus]], [[Teatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Municipal Theater of Rio de Janeiro]], [[Theatro Municipal (S\u00e3o Paulo)|Municipal Theater of S\u00e3o Paulo]] do Rio, and many others.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the greatest composers for the symphonic music were revealed. One of the most outstanding name of this period was [[Leopoldo Miguez]], who followed the [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] style and [[Henrique Oswald]], who incorporated elements of the French [[Impressionism]].\n\n=== Nationalism ===\n[[File:Heitor Vila-Lobos (c. 1922).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Heitor Villa-Lobos]]]]\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, there was a movement for creating an authentically Brazilian music, with less influences of the European culture. In this sense, the [[folklore]] was the major font of inspiration for the composers. Some composers like [[Bras\u00edlio Itiber\u00ea da Cunha]], [[Luciano Gallet]] and [[Alexandre Levy]], despite having a European formation, included some typically Brazilian elements in their works. This trend reached the highest point with [[Alberto Nepomuceno]], who used largely the rhythms and melodies from the Brazilian folklore.\n\nAn important event, later, was the [[Modern Art Week]], in 1922, which had a large impact on concepts of national art. In this event the composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], regarded as the most outstanding name of the Brazilian nationalism, was revealed.\n\nVilla-Lobos did researches about the musical folklore of Brazil, and mixed elements both from classical and popular music. He explored many musical genres such as [[concerto]]s, [[symphony|symphonies]], [[modinha]]s, [[Fado]]s, and other symphonic, vocal and chamber music. Some of his masterworks are the ballet ''[[Uirapuru (Villa-Lobos)|Uirapuru]]'' and the two series of ''[[Ch\u00f4ros]]'' and ''[[Bachianas Brasileiras]]''.\n\nOther composers of Brazilian national music of this era include [[Oscar Lorenzo Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Radam\u00e9s Gnattali]], [[Camargo Guarnieri]], [[Osvaldo Lacerda]], [[Francisco Mignone]], and [[Ernesto Nazareth]].\n\n=== The avant-garde movement ===\n{{see also|Tropicalia}}\nAs a reaction against the nationalist school, who was identified as \"servile\" to the centralizing politics of [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], in 1939 the ''Movimento M\u00fasica Viva'' (Living Music Movement) appeared, led by [[Hans Joachim Koellreutter]] and by [[Eg\u00eddio de Castro e Silva]], defending the adoption of an international style, derived from the [[dodecaphonism]] of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. This group was integrated by composers like [[Cl\u00e1udio Santoro]], [[C\u00e9sar Guerra-Peixe]], [[Eunice Catunda]] and [[Edino Krieger]]. Koellreutter adopted revolutionary methodes, in respect to the individuality of each student and giving to the students the freedom of creativity before the knowledge of the traditional rules for composition. The movement edited a magazine and presented a series of [[radio]] programs showing their fundaments and works of contemporary music. Later, Guerra-Peixe and Santoro followed an independent way, centered in the regional music. Other composers, who used freely the previous styles were [[Marlos Nobre]], [[Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio Rezende de Almeida Prado|Almeida Prado]], and [[Armando Albuquerque]], who created their own styles.\n\nAfter 1960, the Brazilian avant-garde movement received a new wave, focusing on [[serial music]], [[microtonal music]], [[concrete music]] and [[electronic music]], employing a completely new language. This movement was called ''M\u00fasica Nova'' (New Music) and was led by [[Gilberto Mendes]] and [[Willy Corr\u00eaa de Oliveira]].\n\n=== Brazilian Opera ===\n[[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes|Carlos Gomes]] was the first composer on non-European origin to achieve wide recognition in the classical music environment of the Golden age of Opera in Italy. [[Bossa Nova]] was created as anti-opera in a time when opera seemed to represent the art-form of the elite. [5] In recent years the style has been revived with works by [[Jorge Antunes (composer)|Jorge Antunes]], [[Flo Menezes]], and others.\n\nSince 2014 the [[International Brazilian Opera (IBOC)]] has been producing new works, most notably by its Artistic Director and resident composer [[Joao MacDowell]].\n\n=== Contemporary ===\nNowadays, Brazilian music follows the guidelines of both experimentalism and traditional music. Some of the contemporary Brazilian composers are [[Amaral Vieira]], [[S\u00edlvio Ferraz]], [[Flo Menezes]], [[Marcos Balter]], [[Alexandre Lunsqui]], [[Rodolfo Caesar]], [[Felipe Lara]], [[Edson Zampronha]], [[Marcus Siqueira]], [http://www.rodrigolimacomposer.com/ Rodrigo Lima], [[Jorge Antunes (composer)|Jorge Antunes]], [[Roberto Victorio]] and [[Jo\u00e3o MacDowell]]. From the new generation of Brazilian composers, [[Caio Fac\u00f3]] has achieved international recognition for his work.\n\nBrazil has a large number of internationally recognized orchestras and performers, despite the relatively low support of the government. The most famous Brazilian orchestra is probably the [[Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo State Symphony Orchestra]], currently under conductor [[Thierry Fischer]]. Other Brazilian orchestras worthy of note are the [[Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo University Symphony]], the [[Brazilian Symphony Orchestra|Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica Brasileira]], Orquestra Filarm\u00f4nica de Minas Gerais and the [[Petrobras Sinf\u00f4nica]], supported by the Brazilian state oil company [[Petrobras]].\n\nThere are also regular operas scheduled every year in cities such as [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The [[state of S\u00e3o Paulo]] also hosts the Winter Festival in the city of [[Campos do Jord\u00e3o]].\n\nSome of the most famous Brazilian conductors are  [[Roberto Minczuk]], [[John Neschling]] and [[Isaac Karabtchevsky]]. The instrumentalists include, among others: [[Roberto Szidon]], [[Antonio Meneses]], [[Cussy de Almeida]], [[Gilberto Tinetti]], [[Arnaldo Cohen]], [[Nelson Freire]], [[Eud\u00f3xia de Barros]], [[Guiomar Novaes]] and [[Magda Tagliaferro]]. And some of the most famous Brazilian singers were, historically, [[Zola Amaro]], [[Constantina Ara\u00fajo]] and [[Bidu Say\u00e3o]]; living singers include [[Eliane Coelho]], [[Kismara Pessatti]], [[Maria L\u00facia Godoy]], [[Sebasti\u00e3o Teixeira]], and others.\n\nIn the 1980s, a wave of Brazilian heavy metal bands gained public attention. The most commercially successful of these was [[Sepultura]], founded in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1983, preceded by [[Dorsal Atlantica]] and followed by [[Sarcofago]].\n\nThe intrusion of alien elements into Brazil's cultural system is not a destructive process. The return of a democratic government allowed for freedom of expression. The Brazilian music industry opened up to international styles and this has allowed for both foreign and local genres to co-exist and identify people. Each different style relates to the people socially, politically, and economically. \"Brazil is a regionally divided country with a rich cultural and musical diversity among states. As such, musicians in the country choose to define their local heritage differently depending on where they come from.\" This shows how globalization has not robbed Brazil of its identity but instead given it the ability to represent its people both in Brazil and the rest of the world.\n\nIn recent years Brazilian artists have become more interested in Africa, the Caribbean and their own indigenous and folk music. While there are some artists who continue to perform rock and Western pop, there are now just as many contemporaries playing a fusion of African and European influences with those from across The Americas. Some artists have even become influenced by Asian music, noticing some parallels between music from the North-East of Brazil and music from India.\n\n== Indigenous and folk music ==\nThe native peoples of the Brazilian [[rainforest]] play instruments including [[whistle]]s, [[flute]]s, [[French horn|horn]]s, [[drum (musical instrument)|drum]]s and [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s.  Much of the area's folk music imitates the sounds of the [[Amazon Rainforest]].  When the Portuguese arrived in Brazil, the first natives they met played an array of reed [[flute]]s and other [[wind instrument|wind]] and [[percussion instrument]]s.  The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[missionary|missionaries]] introduced songs which used the [[Tupi language]] with Christian lyrics, an attempt to convert the people to Christianity,<ref>[http://www.fmpsd.ab.ca/schools/df/Brazil/mmusic.htm Music]. Fmpsd.ab.ca. Retrieved on 2011-11-23. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310092423/http://www.fmpsd.ab.ca/schools/df/Brazil/mmusic.htm |date=March 10, 2005 }}</ref> and also introduced [[Gregorian chant]] and the flute, [[bow (musical instrument)|bow]], and the [[clavichord]].\n\n[[File:Ilus Abertura Religiosa.jpg|thumb|right|Drum known as Il\u00fa used in Xamb\u00e1 religion in Pernambuco]]\nThe earliest music in what is now Brazil must have been that of the native peoples of the area.  Little is known about their music, since no written records exist of this era.  With the arrival of Europeans, Brazilian culture began to take shape as a synthesis of native musical styles with Portuguese music and African music.\n[[File:Negro fandango scene.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jongo]], a dance and musical genre of African origin, c. 1822]]\n[[File:Rugendas lundu 1835.jpg|thumb|Brazilian dance-song ''[[Lundu (dance)|lundu]]'', c. 1835]]\n\n=== Capoeira music ===\n{{main|Capoeira music}}\n\n[[File:Capoeira-three-berimbau-one-pandeiro.jpg|thumb|right|Three berimbau players]]\nThe [[Afro-Brazilian]] sport of [[capoeira]] is never played without its own music, which is usually considered to be a call-and-response type of folk music. The main instruments of capoeira music include the ''[[berimbau]]'', the ''[[atabaque]]'' and the ''[[pandeiro]]''. [[Capoeira songs]] may be improvised on the spot, or they may be popular songs written by older, and ancient ''mestres'' (teachers), and often include accounts of the history of capoeira, or the doings of great mestres.\n\n=== Maracatu ===\n{{main|Maracatu}}\n\n[[File:Caboclos de lan\u00e7a.jpg|thumb|Maracatu.]]\nThis type of music is played primarily in the [[Recife]] and [[Olinda]] regions during Carnaval. It is an [[Afro-Brazilian]] tradition. The music serves as the backdrop for parade groups that evolved out of ceremonies conducted during colonial times in honour of the Kings of Congo, who were African slaves occupying symbolic leadership positions among the slave population. The music is played on large [[alfaia]] drums, large metal gongu\u00ea bells, snare drums and shakers.  An important variant is found in and around Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1 (called maracatu cearense), which is different from the Recife/Olinda tradition in many respects: triangles are used instead of gongu\u00eas, [[surdo]]s or [[zabumba]]s instead of alfaias.  Also, important female characters are performed by cross-dressed male performers, and all African and Afrobrazilian personages are performed using blackface makeup.\n\n=== Afox\u00e9 ===\n{{main|Afox\u00e9}}\n\nAfox\u00e9 is the name given to a group dedicated to playing ijex\u00e1, which is a kind of [[religious music]], part of the [[Candombl\u00e9]] tradition.  In 1949, a group called [[Filhos de Gandhi]] began playing afox\u00e9 during [[Brazilian Carnival|carnaval]] parades in Salvador; their name translates as ''Sons of Gandhi'', associating black Brazilian activism with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s Indian independence movement.  The Filhos de Gandhi's 1949 appearance was also revolutionary because, until then, the Carnaval parades in Salvador were meant only for light-skinned people.\n\n=== Repente ===\n[[File:De repente, um repentista! (165251858).jpg|thumb|Repentista.]]\n[[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]] is known for a distinctive form of literature called [[cordel literature|literatura de cordel]], which are a type of [[ballad]]s that include elements incorporated into music as \"[[repentismo]]\", an improvised lyrical contest on themes suggested by the audience.\n\nSimilar to Repentismo, appears among the [[Caipira]] culture a musical form derived from [[viola caipira]], which is called ''cururu''.\n\n== Popular music ==\n\n=== Choro ===\n{{main|Choro}}\n[[File:Violao choro.jpg|thumb|left|Choro guitar.]]\n{{Listen|filename=Pixinguinha- O Urubu e o Gaviao 1930.ogg|title=Urubu Malandro|description=\"Urubu Malandro\", recorded in 1930 by Pixinguinha in the flute}}\n{{Listen|filename=003-harmonia_selvagem_-_dante_santoro_1938.ogg|title=Harmonia Selvagem|description=Choro \"Harmonia Selvagem\" composed by Dante Santoro.

Instrumental, its origins are in 19th century Rio de Janeiro. Originally ''choro'' was played by a trio of flute, guitar and cavaquinho (a small chordophone with four strings). The young pianist [[Ernesto Nazareth]] published his first choro (''N\u00e3o Caio Noutra'') in 1878 at the age of 14.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070709135551/http://www.bn.br/fbn/musica/enzinfa.htm Childhood Secrets *]. bn.br</ref> Nazareth's choros are often listed as ''polkas'';<ref>[http://www.chiquinhagonzaga.com/nazareth/ Ernesto Nazareth \u2013 Rei do Choro].

[[Chiquinha Gonzaga]] composed her first success, the polka-choro \"Atraente\", in 1877. In the beginning, the success of choro came from informal groups of friends which played in parties, pubs ([[boteco]]s), streets, home balls (forrobod\u00f3s), and also the musical scores published by print houses.<ref>{{cite book |last=Livingston-Isenhour |first=T. |last2=Garcia |first2=T.

The mainstream success of this style of music (By the 1930s) came from the early days of radio, when bands performed live on the air. By the 1950s and 1960s it was replaced by [[samba]] and [[Bossa Nova]] and other styles of Brazilian popular music, but was still alive in amateur circles called \"rodas de choro\" (informal choro gatherings in residences and [[botecos]]). However, in the late 1970s there was a successful effort to revitalize the genre carried out by some famous artists: [[Pixinguinha]], [[Waldir Azevedo]] and [[Jacob do Bandolim]].\n\n=== Samba ===\n{{main|Samba}}\n[[File:Carmen Miranda 1941.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Singer and actress [[Carmen Miranda]].]]\nIn 1929, prompted by the opening of the first radio station in Rio de Janeiro, the so-called ''radio era'' began spreading songs \u2013 especially the novelty Samba in its current format \u2013 to larger masses. This period was dominated by few male interpreters \u2013 notably Almirante, [[Braguinha (composer)|Braguinha]], [[M\u00e1rio Reis]], [[S\u00edlvio Caldas]], [[Francisco Alves]] and singer/composer [[Noel Rosa]] and even fewer chanteuses such as [[Aracy de Almeida]] and sisters [[Aurora Miranda]] and [[Carmen Miranda]], who eventually came to [[Hollywood]] becoming a movie star.<ref>[http://veja.abril.com.br/110407/p_120.shtml A na\u00e7\u00e3o das cantoras].

Noteworthy Samba composers at this early stage included said [[Noel Rosa]] plus [[Lamartine Babo]] and, around [[World War II]] time, [[Ary Barroso]].\n\n=== MPB (Popular Brazilian Music) ===\n{{main|M\u00fasica popular brasileira}}\n[[File:Brazil.GilbertoGil.01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gilberto Gil]]]]\n\nMPB's early stage (from World War II to the mid-1960s) was populated by male singers such as Orlando Silva, [[Nelson Gon\u00e7alves]], [[Jamel\u00e3o]], [[Agostinho dos Santos]], [[An\u00edsio Silva]], Ataulfo Alves, [[Carlos Galhardo]], [[Ciro Monteiro]], [[Ismael Silva]], [[Jo\u00e3o Dias]], [[Jorge Goulart]], [[Miltinho]], [[Jorge Veiga]] and [[Francisco Eg\u00eddio]] and female singers started to mushroom: [[Nora Ney]], [[Dolores Duran]], [[\u00c2ngela Maria]], [[Emilinha Borba]], Marlene, [[Dalva de Oliveira]], [[Maysa Matarazzo]], sisters [[Linda Batista]] and [[Dircinha Batista]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nMPB's second stage \u2013 after the split [[Bossa Nova]] (1959) / [[Jovem Guarda]] (1965) / [[Tropicalismo]] (both 1967) \u2013 refers to mainstream Brazilian pop music. Well-known MPB artists include, among many others, singers such as [[Elis Regina]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Nara Le\u00e3o]], [[Maria Beth\u00e2nia]], [[M\u00f4nica da Silva]], [[Simone Bittencourt de Oliveira|Simone]], [[Chico Buarque]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]], [[Jorge Ben Jor]], [[Milton Nascimento]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Jo\u00e3o Bosco]], [[Ivan Lins]], [[Djavan]].\n\n=== Bossa nova ===\n{{main|Bossa nova}}\nThe first [[bossa nova]] records by [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]], in the last years of the 1950s, quickly became huge hits in Brazil. [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]] and other [[composer]]s helped further develop this fusion of [[jazz]] harmonies and a smoother, often slower, samba beat, which developed at the beach neighborhoods of [[Ipanema]] and, later, the [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]] nightclubs. Bossa nova was introduced to the rest of the world by American jazz musicians in the early 1960s, and song \"[[The Girl from Ipanema]]\" remains probably the best known Brazilian musical export, eventually becoming a jazz standard.\n\n=== Brazilian gospel ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}\n[[File:Diante do Trono - Grava\u00e7\u00e3o Creio.jpg|thumb|left|[[Diante do Trono]], the main worship ministry in Latin America.]]\n[[Gospel music]] emerged in Brazil before the 1960s with hymnals that were brought and translated into Portuguese by American missionaries. From the late 1960s the first singers of Christian music groups emerged in Brazil, but the songs were not highly valued. Gospel music became popular in Brazil in the late 1990s, with the emergence of congregational singing and bands such as [[Diante do Trono]], led by [[Ana Paula Valad\u00e3o]]. Diante do Trono has become the largest [[contemporary worship music]] ministry in Latin America.\n\n=== Brazilian rock ===\n{{main|Brazilian rock|samba rock}}\n[[File:Rita Lee in Aracatuba-08, by Marco Senche.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rita Lee]]]]\nThe musical style known in Brazil as \"Brazilian [[rock n' roll]]\" dates back to a Portuguese-version cover{{which|date=June 2014}} of \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" in 1954. In the 1960s, young singers like [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]] and the [[Jovem Guarda]] movement were very popular. The 1960s also saw the rise of bands such as the \"[[Tropicalismo|tropicalistas]]\" [[Os Mutantes]] and the experimental (mixing [[progressive rock]], [[jazz]] and [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira]]) Som Imagin\u00e1rio.\n\nThe 1970s saw the emergence of many [[progressive rock]] and/or [[hard rock]] bands such as [[O Ter\u00e7o]], [[A Bolha]], [[A Barca do Sol]], [[Som Nosso de Cada Dia]], [[V\u00edmana]] and [[Bacamarte]], some of which attained some recognition internationally; [[Rita Lee]], in her solo career after [[Os Mutantes]], championed the glam-rock aesthetics in Brazil; [[Casa das M\u00e1quinas]] and [[Patrulha do Espa\u00e7o]] were more bona-fide [[hard rock]] bands, and the likes of ([[Raul Seixas]], [[Secos & Molhados|Secos e Molhados]], [[Novos Baianos]] and [[A Cor do Som]]) mixed the genre with traditional Brazilian music. In the late 1970s, the Brazilian [[punk rock]] scene kicked off mainly in S\u00e3o Paulo and in Bras\u00edlia, booming in the 1980s, with [[Inocentes]], [[C\u00f3lera]], [[Ratos de Por\u00e3o]], [[Garotos Podres]], etc.\n\nThe real commercial boom of Brazilian rock was in the 1980s, with many bands and artists like [[Blitz (Brazilian band)|Blitz]], [[Gang 90]], [[Bar\u00e3o Vermelho]], [[Legi\u00e3o Urbana]], [[Lob\u00e3o]], [[Engenheiros do Hawaii]], [[Tit\u00e3s]], [[Kid Abelha]], [[Paralamas do Sucesso]], and many others, and festivals like [[Rock in Rio]] and [[Hollywood Rock]]. The late 1980s and early 1990s also witnessed the beginnings of an electronica-inspired scene, with a lot more limited commercial potential but achieving some critical acclaim: [[Suba (musician)|Suba]], [[Loop B]], [[Harry (Brazilian musician)|Harry]], etc.\n\n[[File:FTakai.jpg|thumb|[[Fernanda Takai]], singer [[Pato Fu]]]]\nIn the 1990s, the meteoric rise of [[Mamonas Assassinas]], which sold more than 3 million copies of its only CD (a record, by Brazilian standards) came to a tragic end when the band's plane crashed, killing all five members of the band, the pilot and the co-pilot. Other commercially successful bands included [[Jota Quest]], [[Raimundos]] and [[Skank (band)|Skank]], while [[Chico Science & Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi]] and the whole [[Mangue Bit]] movement received much critical attention and accolades, but very little commercial success \u2013 success that declined after the death of one of its founders, [[Chico Science]]. It was also in the 1990s that the first seeds of what would grow into being the Brazilian indie scene were planted, with the creation of indie festivals such as [[Abril Pro Rock]] and, later in the decade, [[Por\u00e3o do Rock]]. The band [[Pato Fu]] was considered by [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine one of the ten best bands in the world outside the United States.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000784,00.html | work=Time | first=Rhett | last=Butler | title=Best Bands: And Our Winners Are | date=September 15, 2001}}</ref> It is also known to re-record hits Brazilian and international versions of toy instruments.\n\nFemale singer [[Pitty]] is also very popular. The indie scene has been growing exponentially since the early 2000s, with more and more festivals taking place all around the country. However, due to several factors including but not limited to the worldwide collapse of the music industry, all the agitation in the indie scene has so far failed in translating into international success, but in Brazil they developed a real, substantial cultural movement. That scene is still much of a ghetto, with bands capturing the attention of international critics, but many playing again in Brazil when they become popular in the exterior, due to the lack of financial and material support which would allow for careers to be developed. One notable exception is [[CSS (band)|CSS]], an alternative [[Electronic rock|electro rock]] outfit that has launched a successful international career, performing in festivals and venues in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Other unique example of success through independent music scene that made to the mainstream is the band [[M\u00f3veis Coloniais de Acaju]]. The band has its own style, somewhere between rock and folk, and is recognized as the most important independent band in Brazil. The record company Trama [https://web.archive.org/web/20090123211659/http://trama.uol.com.br/portalv2/home/index.jsp] tries to support some bands with structure and exposure, and can be credited with early support to [[CSS (band)|CSS]] and later to M\u00f3veis Coloniais de Acaju.\n\n==== Brazilian heavy metal ====\n{{see also|Brazilian thrash metal}}\n[[File:Sepultura @ Maquin\u00e1ria Festival 02.jpg|thumb|[[Sepultura]].]]\nBrazilian [[Heavy metal music|metal]] originated in the mid 1980s with three prominent scenes: Belo Horizonte, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

The first to break into the mainstream was internet phenomenon [[Mallu Magalh\u00e3es]], who played covers of her favourite artists in English and her own songs in both English and Portuguese (as well as other languages).  Magalh\u00e3es only released her first album in 2008, though by then she was already widely recognised as the voice of this sudden new Brazilian folk scene.  Her ex-boyfriend [[H\u00e9lio Flanders]] is the lead singer of another Brazilian folk group called [[Vanguart]].  Though Vanguart had an album released before Mallu Magalh\u00e3es, it was her emergence that consolidated them both and others as a fully recognised mainstream scene, topping charts and being featured in prime time television and advertising.  Other acts emerged after the market was opened up to folk. Writing in English is more and more common among Brazilian rock and folk artists.  This has been highly criticised by Portuguese language purists, though it has helped to promote Brazilian artists in other countries ([[CSS (band)|CSS]] is a perfect example).  The new Brazilian folk scene has just come to the public's attention and it continues to thrive.\n[[File:Os Mutantes.tif|thumb|Os Mutantes, 1969. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]\n\n==== Brazilian psychedelic rock ====\n{{main|Mangue Bit}}\nBrazil has a long tradition of psychedelic music since artists like [[Os Mutantes]], [[Ronnie Von]] and other rock bands from the late 60s. Nowadays, there exists a revival of this psychedelic/vintage inspired music represented by artists like [[Jupiter Apple]], [[Violeta de Outono]], [[Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi]], [[Mundo Livre S/A]], [[:pt:Cidad\u00e3o Instigado|Cidad\u00e3o Instigado]], [[Otto (singer)|Otto]], China, Kassin, [[:pt:Pata de Elefante|Pata de Elefante]], [[Orquestra Abstrata]], among others.\n\n=== Sertanejo ===\n{{main|M\u00fasica sertaneja}}\n[[File:Ch&xr.jpg|thumb|[[Chit\u00e3ozinho & Xoror\u00f3]].]]\nM\u00fasica sertaneja or Sertanejo is a term for Brazilian [[country music]]. It originally referred to music originating among [[Sert\u00e3o]] and musica [[caipira]]. (Caipira music appeared in the state of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], and some the regions of [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], [[Goi\u00e1s]]  [[Minas Gerais]], [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]] and [[Mato Grosso]].

Rhythms are slow and plodding, and are derived from [[guitar]]s instead of [[percussion instrument]]s like in the rest of Brazil\u2014in this region, African rhythms and Portuguese melodies combined to form [[maracatu]].

Some of the most famous musicians of this genre are [[Renato Borghetti]], [[Yamandu Costa]], [[Jayme Caetano Braun]] and [[Luiz Marenco]], among others.\n\n=== Music of Salvador: Late 60s to mid-70s ===\nIn the latter part of the 1960s, a group of black Bahians began dressing as [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] during the Salvadoran Carnaval, identifying with their shared struggles through history.  These groups included [[Comanches do Pel\u00f4]] and [[Apaches de Toror\u00f3]] and were known for a forceful and powerful style of percussion, and frequent violent encounters with the police.  Starting in 1974, a group of black Bahians called [[Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea]] became prominent, identifying with the [[Yoruba people]] of [[West Africa]].  Along with a policy of loosening restrictions by the Brazilian government, Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea's sound and message spread to groups like [[Olodum|Grupo Cultural do Olodum]], who established community centers and other philanthropic efforts.\n\n=== Frevo ===\n{{main|Frevo}}\n\n[[Frevo]] is a style of music from [[Olinda]] and [[Recife]].

In Rio it is most often simply known as Funk, although it is very different musically from what [[Funk]] means in most other places and contexts.  Funk Carioca, like other types of hip-hop lifts heavily from samples such as international rips or from previous funk music.
