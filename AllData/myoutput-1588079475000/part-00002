Their leadership came from the religious congregations of [[Brownist]]s, or Separatist [[Puritans]], who had fled religious persecution in England for the tolerance of 17th-century Holland in the Netherlands. They held Puritan [[Calvinist]] religious beliefs but, unlike most other Puritans, they maintained that their congregations should separate from the English state church. They eventually determined to establish a new settlement in the New World and arranged with investors to fund them. They established Plymouth Colony in 1620, which became the second successful English settlement in America, following the founding of [[Jamestown, Virginia]], in 1607. The Pilgrims' story became a central theme in the history and culture of the United States.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Davis|first1=Kenneth.

As separatists, they held that their differences with the Church of England were irreconcilable and that their worship should be independent of the trappings, traditions, and organization of a central church.<ref name=\"bradford_1_1\">{{harvnb|Bradford|(1898)|loc=Book 1, Chapter 1.|Ref=Bradford_1898}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Journey to the Mayflower|last=Tomkins|first=Stephen|publisher=|year=2020|isbn=9781473649101|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe Separatist movement was controversial. Under the [[Act of Uniformity 1559]], it was illegal not to attend official Church of England services, with a fine of one shilling (\u00a30.05; about \u00a3{{Formatprice|{{inflation|UK|0.05|1559}}|0}} today){{inflation-fn|UK}} for each missed Sunday and holy day. The penalties included imprisonment and larger fines for conducting unofficial services. The Seditious Sectaries Act of 1593 was specifically aimed at outlawing the Brownists. Under this policy, the London Underground Church from 1566, and then Robert Browne and his followers in Norfolk during the 1580s, were repeatedly imprisoned. Henry Barrow, John Greenwood, and [[John Penry]] were executed for sedition in 1593. Browne had taken his followers into exile in [[Middelburg]], and Penry urged the London Separatists to emigrate in order to escape persecution, so after his death they went to Amsterdam.\n\nDuring much of Brewster's tenure (1595\u20131606), the Archbishop was [[Matthew Hutton (Archbishop of York)|Matthew Hutton]]. He displayed some sympathy to the Puritan cause, writing to [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], Secretary of State to [[James I of England|James I]] in 1604:\n<blockquote>\nThe Puritans though they differ in Ceremonies and accidentes, yet they agree with us in substance of religion, and I thinke all or the moste parte of them love his Majestie, and the presente state, and I hope will yield to conformitie.

The same year, [[Richard Bancroft]] became Archbishop of Canterbury and launched a campaign against Puritanism. He suspended 300 ministers and fired 80, which led some of them to found Separatist churches. Robinson, Clifton, and their followers founded a Brownist church, making a covenant with God \"to walk in all his ways made known, or to be made known, unto them, according to their best endeavours, whatsoever it should cost them, the Lord assisting them\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Journey to the Mayflower|last=Tomkins|first=Stephen|publisher=Pegasus|year=2020|isbn=9781643133676|location=London and New York|pages=258}}</ref>\n\nArchbishop Hutton died in 1606 and [[Tobias Matthew]] was appointed as his replacement.

There he participated in a series of debates, particularly regarding the contentious issue of [[Calvinism]] versus [[Arminianism]] (siding with the Calvinists against the [[Remonstrants]]).<ref>See the [[Synod of Dort]].</ref>\nBrewster acquired [[typesetting]] equipment about 1616 in a venture financed by Thomas Brewer, and began publishing the debates through a local press.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffis|(1899)|pp=[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&root=%2Fmoa%2Fnewe%2Fnewe0025%2F&tif=00569.TIF&view=50 561\u2013562].|Ref=Griffis_1899}}</ref>\n\nThe Netherlands, however, was a land whose culture and language were strange and difficult for the English congregation to understand or learn. They found the Dutch morals much too libertine, and their children were becoming more and more Dutch as the years passed. The congregation came to believe that they faced eventual extinction if they remained there.<ref>Bradford writes: \"so as it was not only probably thought, but apparently seen, that within a few years more they would be in danger to scatter, by necessities pressing them, or sinke under their burdens, or both.\" (''Of Plimoth Plantation'', chapt. 4)</ref>\n\n====Decision to leave Holland====\nBy 1617, the congregation was stable and relatively secure, but there were ongoing issues which needed to be resolved. Bradford noted that many members of the congregation were showing signs of early aging, compounding the difficulties which some had in supporting themselves. A few had spent their savings and so gave up and returned to England, and the leaders feared that more would follow and that the congregation would become unsustainable. The employment issues made it unattractive for others to come to Leiden, and younger members had begun leaving to find employment and adventure elsewhere. Also compelling was the possibility of missionary work in some distant land, an opportunity that rarely arose in a Protestant stronghold.<ref name=\"bradford_1_4\">{{harvnb|Bradford|(1898)|loc=Book 1, Chapter 4.|Ref=Bradford_1898}}</ref>\n\nBradford lists some of the reasons which the Puritans had to leave, including the discouragements that they faced in the Netherlands and the hope of attracting others by finding \"a better, and easier place of living\", the children of the group being \"drawn away by evil examples into extravagance and dangerous courses\", and the \"great hope, for the propagating and advancing the gospel of the kingdom of Christ in those remote parts of the world.\"<!-- Direct quote; please do not change spelling. --><ref name=\"bradford_1_4\" /> [[Edward Winslow]]'s list was similar. In addition to the economic worries and missionary possibilities, he stressed that it was important for the people to retain their English identity, culture, and language. They also believed that the English Church in Leiden could do little to benefit the larger community there.<ref>{{harvnb|Winslow|(2003)|pp=[http://static.squarespace.com/static/50a02efce4b046b42952af27/t/50a86ec2e4b0ea694c52fade/1353215682312/HypocrisyUnmasked.pdf#page=62 62\u201363].|Ref=none}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, there were many uncertainties about moving to such a place as America, as stories had come back about failed colonies. There were fears that the native people would be violent, that there would be no source of food or water, that they might be exposed to unknown diseases, and that travel by sea was always hazardous. Balancing all this was a local political situation which was in danger of becoming unstable. The truce was faltering in the [[Eighty Years' War]], and there was fear over what the attitudes of Spain might be toward them.<ref name=\"bradford_1_4\" />\n\nPossible destinations included [[The Guianas|Guiana]] on the northeast coast of South America where the Dutch had established [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] colony, or another site near the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia|Virginia]] settlements. Virginia was an attractive destination because the presence of the older colony might offer better security and trade opportunities; however, they also felt that they should not settle too near, since that might inadvertently duplicate the political environment back in England. The [[London Company]] administered a territory of considerable size in the region, and the intended settlement location was at the mouth of the [[Hudson River]] (which instead became the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]]). This plan allayed their concerns of social, political, and religious conflicts, but still promised the military and economic benefits of being close to an established colony.<ref>Brown, John (1970).

Slade was also a spy for the English Ambassador, and the Puritans' plans were therefore known both at court and among influential investors in the Virginia Company's colony at Jamestown.<ref name=david>[http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/4627 Baeckelandt, David. \"The Flemish Influence On Henry Hudson\", ''The Brussels Journal'', January 1, 2011]</ref> Negotiations were broken off with the Dutch, however, at the encouragement of English merchant [[Thomas Weston (merchant adventurer)|Thomas Weston]], who assured them that he could resolve the London Company delays.<ref name=\"bradford_1_6\">{{harvnb|Bradford|(1898)|loc=Book 1, Chapter 6.|Ref=Bradford_1898}}</ref> The London Company intended to claim the area explored by Hudson<ref name=david/> before the Dutch could become fully established, and the first Dutch settlers did not arrive in the area until 1624.\n\nWeston did come with a substantial change, telling the Leiden group that parties in England had obtained a land grant north of the existing Virginia territory to be called [[New England]]. This was only partially true; the new grant did come to pass, but not until late in 1620 when the [[Plymouth Council for New England]] received its charter. It was expected that this area could be fished profitably, and it was not under the control of the existing Virginia government.<ref name=\"bradford_1_6\" /><ref name=\"necharter\">{{cite web\n| url         = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/mass01.asp\n| title       = The Charter of New England: 1620\n| accessdate  = November 11, 2008\n| work        = The Avalon Project\n| publisher   = Yale Law School\n| location    = New Haven\n}}</ref>\n\nA second change was known only to parties in England who did not inform the larger group. New investors had been brought into the venture who wanted the terms altered so that, at the end of the seven-year contract, half of the settled land and property would revert to the investors. Also, there had been a provision which allowed each settler to have two days per week to work on personal business, but this provision had been dropped from the agreement without the knowledge of the Puritans.<ref name=\"bradford_1_6\" />\n\nAmid these negotiations, William Brewster found himself involved with religious unrest emerging in Scotland. In 1618, King James had promulgated the [[Five Articles of Perth]] which were seen in Scotland as an attempt to encroach on their Presbyterian tradition. Brewster published several pamphlets that were critical of this law, and they were smuggled into Scotland by April 1619. These pamphlets were traced back to Leiden, and the English authorities unsuccessfully attempted to arrest Brewster. English ambassador [[Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester|Dudley Carleton]] became aware of the situation and began pressuring the Dutch government to extradite Brewster, and the Dutch responded by arresting Thomas Brewer the financier in September. Brewster's whereabouts remain unknown between then and the colonists' departure, but the Dutch authorities did seize the typesetting materials which he had used to print his pamphlets. Meanwhile, Brewer was sent to England for questioning, where he stonewalled government officials until well into 1620. He was ultimately convicted in England for his continued religious publication activities and sentenced in 1626 to a 14-year prison term.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffis|(1899)|p=[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&root=%2Fmoa%2Fnewe%2Fnewe0025%2F&tif=00583.TIF&view=50 575].|Ref=Griffis_1899}}</ref>\n\n====Preparations====\nNot all of the congregation were able to depart on the first trip. Many members were not able to settle their affairs within the time constraints, and the budget was limited for travel and supplies, and the group decided that the initial settlement should be undertaken primarily by younger and stronger members. The remainder agreed to follow if and when they could. Robinson would remain in Leiden with the larger portion of the congregation, and Brewster was to lead the American congregation. The church in America would be run independently, but it was agreed that membership would automatically be granted in either congregation to members who moved between the continents.\n\nWith personal and business matters agreed upon, the Puritans procured supplies and a small ship.  ''[[Speedwell (1577 ship)|Speedwell]]'' was to bring some passengers from the Netherlands to England, then on to America where it would be kept for the fishing business, with a crew hired for support services during the first year. The larger ship ''[[Mayflower]]'' was leased for transport and exploration services.<ref name=\"bradford_1_6\" /><ref name=\"bradford_1_7\">{{harvnb|Bradford|(1898)|loc=Book 1, Chapter 7.|Ref=Bradford_1898}}</ref>\n\n===Voyage===\n[[File:17th-century-merchantman.jpg|thumb|Model of a typical [[Cargo ship|merchantman]] of the period, showing the cramped conditions that had to be endured]]\nThe ''[[Speedwell (1577 ship)|Speedwell]]'' was originally named ''Swiftsure''.

The crew inspected ''Speedwell'' for leaks and sealed them, but their second attempt to depart got them only as far as [[Plymouth]], [[Devon]]. The crew decided that ''Speedwell'' was untrustworthy, and her owners sold her; the ship's master and some of the crew transferred to the ''Mayflower'' for the trip. [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]] observed that the ''Speedwell'' seemed \"overmasted\", thus putting a strain on the hull; and he attributed her leaking to crew members who had deliberately caused it, allowing them to abandon their year-long commitments.

Small parties, however, waded to the beach to fetch firewood and attend to long-deferred personal hygiene.\n\nExploratory parties were undertaken while awaiting the shallop, led by [[Myles Standish]] (an English soldier whom the colonists had met while in Leiden) and [[Christopher Jones (sailor)|Christopher Jones]]. They encountered an old European-built house and iron kettle, left behind by some ship's crew, and a few recently cultivated fields, showing corn stubble.<ref>Brown, John (1895). The Pilgrim Fathers of New England and their Puritan Successors. Reprinted: 1970.

Farther along, a similar mound was found, more recently made, and they discovered that some of the burial mounds also contained corn. The colonists took some of the corn, intending to use it as seed for planting, while they reburied the rest. [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]] later recorded in his book ''[[Of Plymouth Plantation]]'' that, after the shallop had been repaired,\n<blockquote>\nThey also found two of the Indian's houses covered with mats, and some of their implements in them; but the people had run away and could not be seen. Without permission they took more corn, and beans of various colours. These they brought away, intending to give them full satisfaction (payment) when they should meet with any of them, \u2013 as about six months afterwards they did.\n\nAnd it is to be noted as a special providence of God, and a great mercy to this poor people, that they thus got seed to plant corn the next year, or they might have starved; for they had none, nor any likelihood of getting any, till too late for the planting season.\n</blockquote>\n\nBy December, most of the passengers and crew had become ill, coughing violently. Many were also suffering from the effects of [[scurvy]]. There had already been ice and snowfall, hampering exploration efforts; half of them died during the first winter.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Klinkenborg|first1=Verlyn|title=Why Was Life So Hard for the Pilgrims?|journal=American History|date=December 2011|volume=46|issue=5|page=36}}</ref>\n\n====First contact====\nExplorations resumed on December 6/16. The shallop party headed south along the cape, consisting of seven colonists from Leiden, three from London, and seven crew; they chose to land at the area inhabited by the [[Nauset]] people (the area around [[Brewster, Massachusetts|Brewster]], [[Chatham, Massachusetts|Chatham]], [[Eastham, Massachusetts|Eastham]], [[Harwich, Massachusetts|Harwich]], and [[Orleans, Massachusetts|Orleans]]) where they saw some people on the shore who fled when they approached. Inland they found more mounds, one containing acorns which they exhumed, and more graves, which they decided not to dig. They remained ashore overnight and heard cries near the encampment. The following morning, they were attacked by Indians who shot at them with arrows. The colonists retrieved their firearms and shot back, then chased them into the woods but did not find them. There was no more contact with Indians for several months.<ref name=\"bradford_1_10\">{{harvnb|Bradford|(1898)|loc=Book 1, Chapter 10.|Ref=Bradford_1898}}</ref>\n\nThe local Indians were already familiar with the English, who had intermittently visited the area for fishing and trade before ''Mayflower'' arrived. In the Cape Cod area, relations were poor following a visit several years earlier by [[Thomas Hunt (slaver)|Thomas Hunt]]. Hunt kidnapped 20 people from Patuxet (the site of Plymouth Colony) and another seven from Nausett, and he attempted to sell them as slaves in Europe. One of the Patuxet abductees was [[Squanto]], who became an ally of the Plymouth Colony.\n\nThe [[Pokanoket]]s also lived nearby and had developed a particular dislike for the English after one group came in, captured numerous people, and shot them aboard their ship. By this time, there had already been reciprocal killings at [[Martha's Vineyard]] and Cape Cod. But during one of the captures by the English, Squanto escaped to England and there became a Christian. When he came back, he found that most of his tribe had died from plague.<ref name=\"bradford_2_1620\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Bradford and Winslow|(1865)|pp=[https://books.google.com/?id=xb3coQS13NYC&pg=PA90 90\u201391].|Ref=Bradford_Winslow_1865}}</ref>\n\n====Settlement====\n{{main|Plymouth Colony}}\n[[File:Port St Louis Annotated.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Samuel de Champlain]]'s 1605 map of Plymouth Harbor showing the Wampanoag village of Patuxet, with some modern place names added for reference.

They rowed for safety, encountering the harbor formed by [[Duxbury, Massachusetts|Duxbury]] and Plymouth barrier beaches and stumbling on land in the darkness. They remained at this spot for two days to recuperate and repair equipment. They named it Clark's Island for a ''Mayflower'' mate who first set foot on it.<ref>John (1895).

This land was especially suited to winter building because it had already been cleared, and the tall hills provided a good defensive position.\n\nThe cleared village was known as Patuxet to the [[Wampanoag people]] and was abandoned about three years earlier following a plague that killed all of its residents.

The patent of [[Plymouth Colony]] was surrendered by Bradford to the [[Freeman (Colonial)|freemen]] in 1640, minus a small reserve of three tracts of land. Bradford served for 11 consecutive years, and was elected to various other terms until his death in 1657.\n\nThe colony contained [[Bristol County, Massachusetts|Bristol County]], [[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth County]], and [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts]]. The [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] was reorganized and issued a new charter as the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] in 1691, and Plymouth ended its history as a separate colony.\n\n==Etymology==\n\n===Bradford's history===\nThe first use of the word ''pilgrims'' for the ''Mayflower'' passengers appeared in [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]]'s ''[[Of Plymouth Plantation]]''. As he finished recounting his group's July 1620 departure from Leiden, he used the imagery of [http://classic.studylight.org/desk/?l=en&query=Hebrews+11%3A13-16&translation=gen Hebrews 11:13\u201316] about  [[Old Testament]] \"strangers and pilgrims\" who had the opportunity to return to their old country but instead longed for a better, heavenly country. \n<blockquote>\nSo they lefte [that] goodly & pleasante citie, which had been ther resting place, nere 12 years; but they knew they were pilgrimes, & looked not much on these things; but lift up their eyes to y<sup>e</sup> heavens, their dearest cuntrie, and quieted their spirits.<!-- Direct quote; please do not change spelling. --><ref name=\"bradford_1_7\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nThere is no record of the term ''Pilgrims'' being used to describe Plymouth's founders for 150 years after Bradford wrote this passage, except when quoting him. The ''Mayflower's'' story was retold by historians [[Nathaniel Morton]] (in 1669) and [[Cotton Mather]] (in 1702), and both paraphrased Bradford's passage and used his word  ''pilgrims''. At Plymouth's [[Forefathers' Day]] observance in 1793, Rev. Chandler Robbins recited this passage.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthews|(1915)|pp=[https://books.google.com/?id=47gMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA356 356\u2013359].|Ref=Matthews_1915}}</ref>\n\n===Popular use===\n[[File:1920USstamp2centPilgrimTercentenaryLanding.jpg|thumb|right|1920 U.S. stamp celebrating the Pilgrim Tercentenary]]\nThe name ''Pilgrims'' was probably not in popular use before about 1798, even though Plymouth celebrated [[Forefathers' Day]] several times between 1769 and 1798 and used a variety of terms to honor Plymouth's founders.

Under the [[Act of Uniformity 1559]], it was illegal not to attend official Church of England services, with a fine of one shilling (\u00a30.05; about \u00a3{{Formatprice|{{inflation|UK|0.05|1559}}|0}} today){{inflation-fn|UK}} for each missed Sunday and holy day. The penalties included imprisonment and larger fines for conducting unofficial services. The Seditious Sectaries Act of 1593 was specifically aimed at outlawing the Brownists. Under this policy, the London Underground Church from 1566, and then Robert Browne and his followers in Norfolk during the 1580s, were repeatedly imprisoned. Henry Barrow, John Greenwood, and [[John Penry]] were executed for sedition in 1593. Browne had taken his followers into exile in [[Middelburg]], and Penry urged the London Separatists to emigrate in order to escape persecution, so after his death they went to Amsterdam.\n\nDuring much of Brewster's tenure (1595\u20131606), the Archbishop was [[Matthew Hutton (Archbishop of York)|Matthew Hutton]]. He displayed some sympathy to the Puritan cause, writing to [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], Secretary of State to [[James I of England|James I]] in 1604:\n<blockquote>\nThe Puritans though they differ in Ceremonies and accidentes, yet they agree with us in substance of religion, and I thinke all or the moste parte of them love his Majestie, and the presente state, and I hope will yield to conformitie.

The same year, [[Richard Bancroft]] became Archbishop of Canterbury and launched a campaign against Puritanism. He suspended 300 ministers and fired 80, which led some of them to found Separatist churches.

They found the Dutch morals much too libertine, and their children were becoming more and more Dutch as the years passed. The congregation came to believe that they faced eventual extinction if they remained there.<ref>Bradford writes: \"so as it was not only probably thought, but apparently seen, that within a few years more they would be in danger to scatter, by necessities pressing them, or sinke under their burdens, or both.\" (''Of Plimoth Plantation'', chapt. 4)</ref>\n\n====Decision to leave Holland====\nBy 1617, the congregation was stable and relatively secure, but there were ongoing issues which needed to be resolved. Bradford noted that many members of the congregation were showing signs of early aging, compounding the difficulties which some had in supporting themselves. A few had spent their savings and so gave up and returned to England, and the leaders feared that more would follow and that the congregation would become unsustainable. The employment issues made it unattractive for others to come to Leiden, and younger members had begun leaving to find employment and adventure elsewhere. Also compelling was the possibility of missionary work in some distant land, an opportunity that rarely arose in a Protestant stronghold.<ref name=\"bradford_1_4\">{{harvnb|Bradford|(1898)|loc=Book 1, Chapter 4.|Ref=Bradford_1898}}</ref>\n\nBradford lists some of the reasons which the Puritans had to leave, including the discouragements that they faced in the Netherlands and the hope of attracting others by finding \"a better, and easier place of living\", the children of the group being \"drawn away by evil examples into extravagance and dangerous courses\", and the \"great hope, for the propagating and advancing the gospel of the kingdom of Christ in those remote parts of the world.\"<!-- Direct quote; please do not change spelling. --><ref name=\"bradford_1_4\" /> [[Edward Winslow]]'s list was similar. In addition to the economic worries and missionary possibilities, he stressed that it was important for the people to retain their English identity, culture, and language. They also believed that the English Church in Leiden could do little to benefit the larger community there.<ref>{{harvnb|Winslow|(2003)|pp=[http://static.squarespace.com/static/50a02efce4b046b42952af27/t/50a86ec2e4b0ea694c52fade/1353215682312/HypocrisyUnmasked.pdf#page=62 62\u201363].|Ref=none}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, there were many uncertainties about moving to such a place as America, as stories had come back about failed colonies. There were fears that the native people would be violent, that there would be no source of food or water, that they might be exposed to unknown diseases, and that travel by sea was always hazardous. Balancing all this was a local political situation which was in danger of becoming unstable. The truce was faltering in the [[Eighty Years' War]], and there was fear over what the attitudes of Spain might be toward them.<ref name=\"bradford_1_4\" />\n\nPossible destinations included [[The Guianas|Guiana]] on the northeast coast of South America where the Dutch had established [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] colony, or another site near the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia|Virginia]] settlements. Virginia was an attractive destination because the presence of the older colony might offer better security and trade opportunities; however, they also felt that they should not settle too near, since that might inadvertently duplicate the political environment back in England. The [[London Company]] administered a territory of considerable size in the region, and the intended settlement location was at the mouth of the [[Hudson River]] (which instead became the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]]). This plan allayed their concerns of social, political, and religious conflicts, but still promised the military and economic benefits of being close to an established colony.<ref>Brown, John (1970).

This was only partially true; the new grant did come to pass, but not until late in 1620 when the [[Plymouth Council for New England]] received its charter.

New investors had been brought into the venture who wanted the terms altered so that, at the end of the seven-year contract, half of the settled land and property would revert to the investors. Also, there had been a provision which allowed each settler to have two days per week to work on personal business, but this provision had been dropped from the agreement without the knowledge of the Puritans.<ref name=\"bradford_1_6\" />\n\nAmid these negotiations, William Brewster found himself involved with religious unrest emerging in Scotland. In 1618, King James had promulgated the [[Five Articles of Perth]] which were seen in Scotland as an attempt to encroach on their Presbyterian tradition. Brewster published several pamphlets that were critical of this law, and they were smuggled into Scotland by April 1619. These pamphlets were traced back to Leiden, and the English authorities unsuccessfully attempted to arrest Brewster. English ambassador [[Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester|Dudley Carleton]] became aware of the situation and began pressuring the Dutch government to extradite Brewster, and the Dutch responded by arresting Thomas Brewer the financier in September. Brewster's whereabouts remain unknown between then and the colonists' departure, but the Dutch authorities did seize the typesetting materials which he had used to print his pamphlets. Meanwhile, Brewer was sent to England for questioning, where he stonewalled government officials until well into 1620. He was ultimately convicted in England for his continued religious publication activities and sentenced in 1626 to a 14-year prison term.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffis|(1899)|p=[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&root=%2Fmoa%2Fnewe%2Fnewe0025%2F&tif=00583.TIF&view=50 575].|Ref=Griffis_1899}}</ref>\n\n====Preparations====\nNot all of the congregation were able to depart on the first trip. Many members were not able to settle their affairs within the time constraints, and the budget was limited for travel and supplies, and the group decided that the initial settlement should be undertaken primarily by younger and stronger members. The remainder agreed to follow if and when they could. Robinson would remain in Leiden with the larger portion of the congregation, and Brewster was to lead the American congregation. The church in America would be run independently, but it was agreed that membership would automatically be granted in either congregation to members who moved between the continents.\n\nWith personal and business matters agreed upon, the Puritans procured supplies and a small ship.  ''[[Speedwell (1577 ship)|Speedwell]]'' was to bring some passengers from the Netherlands to England, then on to America where it would be kept for the fishing business, with a crew hired for support services during the first year.

The crew inspected ''Speedwell'' for leaks and sealed them, but their second attempt to depart got them only as far as [[Plymouth]], [[Devon]]. The crew decided that ''Speedwell'' was untrustworthy, and her owners sold her; the ship's master and some of the crew transferred to the ''Mayflower'' for the trip. [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]] observed that the ''Speedwell'' seemed \"overmasted\", thus putting a strain on the hull; and he attributed her leaking to crew members who had deliberately caused it, allowing them to abandon their year-long commitments.

Small parties, however, waded to the beach to fetch firewood and attend to long-deferred personal hygiene.\n\nExploratory parties were undertaken while awaiting the shallop, led by [[Myles Standish]] (an English soldier whom the colonists had met while in Leiden) and [[Christopher Jones (sailor)|Christopher Jones]]. They encountered an old European-built house and iron kettle, left behind by some ship's crew, and a few recently cultivated fields, showing corn stubble.<ref>Brown, John (1895). The Pilgrim Fathers of New England and their Puritan Successors. Reprinted: 1970. Pasadena, Texas: Pilgrim Publications. pp. 198.\n</ref>\n\nThey came upon an artificial mound near the dunes which they partially uncovered and found to be an Indian grave. Farther along, a similar mound was found, more recently made, and they discovered that some of the burial mounds also contained corn. The colonists took some of the corn, intending to use it as seed for planting, while they reburied the rest. [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]] later recorded in his book ''[[Of Plymouth Plantation]]'' that, after the shallop had been repaired,\n<blockquote>\nThey also found two of the Indian's houses covered with mats, and some of their implements in them; but the people had run away and could not be seen. Without permission they took more corn, and beans of various colours. These they brought away, intending to give them full satisfaction (payment) when they should meet with any of them, \u2013 as about six months afterwards they did.\n\nAnd it is to be noted as a special providence of God, and a great mercy to this poor people, that they thus got seed to plant corn the next year, or they might have starved; for they had none, nor any likelihood of getting any, till too late for the planting season.\n</blockquote>\n\nBy December, most of the passengers and crew had become ill, coughing violently. Many were also suffering from the effects of [[scurvy]]. There had already been ice and snowfall, hampering exploration efforts; half of them died during the first winter.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Klinkenborg|first1=Verlyn|title=Why Was Life So Hard for the Pilgrims?|journal=American History|date=December 2011|volume=46|issue=5|page=36}}</ref>\n\n====First contact====\nExplorations resumed on December 6/16. The shallop party headed south along the cape, consisting of seven colonists from Leiden, three from London, and seven crew; they chose to land at the area inhabited by the [[Nauset]] people (the area around [[Brewster, Massachusetts|Brewster]], [[Chatham, Massachusetts|Chatham]], [[Eastham, Massachusetts|Eastham]], [[Harwich, Massachusetts|Harwich]], and [[Orleans, Massachusetts|Orleans]]) where they saw some people on the shore who fled when they approached. Inland they found more mounds, one containing acorns which they exhumed, and more graves, which they decided not to dig. They remained ashore overnight and heard cries near the encampment. The following morning, they were attacked by Indians who shot at them with arrows. The colonists retrieved their firearms and shot back, then chased them into the woods but did not find them. There was no more contact with Indians for several months.<ref name=\"bradford_1_10\">{{harvnb|Bradford|(1898)|loc=Book 1, Chapter 10.|Ref=Bradford_1898}}</ref>\n\nThe local Indians were already familiar with the English, who had intermittently visited the area for fishing and trade before ''Mayflower'' arrived. In the Cape Cod area, relations were poor following a visit several years earlier by [[Thomas Hunt (slaver)|Thomas Hunt]]. Hunt kidnapped 20 people from Patuxet (the site of Plymouth Colony) and another seven from Nausett, and he attempted to sell them as slaves in Europe. One of the Patuxet abductees was [[Squanto]], who became an ally of the Plymouth Colony.\n\nThe [[Pokanoket]]s also lived nearby and had developed a particular dislike for the English after one group came in, captured numerous people, and shot them aboard their ship. By this time, there had already been reciprocal killings at [[Martha's Vineyard]] and Cape Cod. But during one of the captures by the English, Squanto escaped to England and there became a Christian. When he came back, he found that most of his tribe had died from plague.<ref name=\"bradford_2_1620\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Bradford and Winslow|(1865)|pp=[https://books.google.com/?id=xb3coQS13NYC&pg=PA90 90\u201391].|Ref=Bradford_Winslow_1865}}</ref>\n\n====Settlement====\n{{main|Plymouth Colony}}\n[[File:Port St Louis Annotated.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Samuel de Champlain]]'s 1605 map of Plymouth Harbor showing the Wampanoag village of Patuxet, with some modern place names added for reference.

They rowed for safety, encountering the harbor formed by [[Duxbury, Massachusetts|Duxbury]] and Plymouth barrier beaches and stumbling on land in the darkness. They remained at this spot for two days to recuperate and repair equipment. They named it Clark's Island for a ''Mayflower'' mate who first set foot on it.<ref>John (1895).

The anniversary of this survey is observed in Massachusetts as [[Forefathers' Day]] and is traditionally associated with the [[Plymouth Rock]] landing tradition. This land was especially suited to winter building because it had already been cleared, and the tall hills provided a good defensive position.\n\nThe cleared village was known as Patuxet to the [[Wampanoag people]] and was abandoned about three years earlier following a plague that killed all of its residents.

On March 22, 1621, the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony signed a peace treaty with [[Massasoit]] of the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoags]]. The patent of [[Plymouth Colony]] was surrendered by Bradford to the [[Freeman (Colonial)|freemen]] in 1640, minus a small reserve of three tracts of land. Bradford served for 11 consecutive years, and was elected to various other terms until his death in 1657.\n\nThe colony contained [[Bristol County, Massachusetts|Bristol County]], [[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth County]], and [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts]]. The [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] was reorganized and issued a new charter as the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] in 1691, and Plymouth ended its history as a separate colony.\n\n==Etymology==\n\n===Bradford's history===\nThe first use of the word ''pilgrims'' for the ''Mayflower'' passengers appeared in [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]]'s ''[[Of Plymouth Plantation]]''. As he finished recounting his group's July 1620 departure from Leiden, he used the imagery of [http://classic.studylight.org/desk/?l=en&query=Hebrews+11%3A13-16&translation=gen Hebrews 11:13\u201316] about  [[Old Testament]] \"strangers and pilgrims\" who had the opportunity to return to their old country but instead longed for a better, heavenly country. \n<blockquote>\nSo they lefte [that] goodly & pleasante citie, which had been ther resting place, nere 12 years; but they knew they were pilgrimes, & looked not much on these things; but lift up their eyes to y<sup>e</sup> heavens, their dearest cuntrie, and quieted their spirits.<!-- Direct quote; please do not change spelling. --><ref name=\"bradford_1_7\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nThere is no record of the term ''Pilgrims'' being used to describe Plymouth's founders for 150 years after Bradford wrote this passage, except when quoting him. The ''Mayflower's'' story was retold by historians [[Nathaniel Morton]] (in 1669) and [[Cotton Mather]] (in 1702), and both paraphrased Bradford's passage and used his word  ''pilgrims''. At Plymouth's [[Forefathers' Day]] observance in 1793, Rev. Chandler Robbins recited this passage.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthews|(1915)|pp=[https://books.google.com/?id=47gMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA356 356\u2013359].|Ref=Matthews_1915}}</ref>\n\n===Popular use===\n[[File:1920USstamp2centPilgrimTercentenaryLanding.jpg|thumb|right|1920 U.S. stamp celebrating the Pilgrim Tercentenary]]\nThe name ''Pilgrims'' was probably not in popular use before about 1798, even though Plymouth celebrated [[Forefathers' Day]] several times between 1769 and 1798 and used a variety of terms to honor Plymouth's founders.
