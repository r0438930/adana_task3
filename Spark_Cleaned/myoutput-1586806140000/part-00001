Stearns was born in [[Medford, Massachusetts]] on January 8, 1809, the eldest son and second child of Luther and Mary (Hall) Stearns. His paternal immigrant ancestor, Isaac Sterne, arrived in Salem on June 12, 1630, from [[Suffolk]], [[England]]. He had sailed to the new colony with [[John Winthrop]], a future governor, and Sir [[Richard Saltonstall]], among others. Isaac Sterne moved to Watertown, located along the [[Charles River]], where he died in 1671. What became known as the American Stearns family (note spelling variation) grew, with branches moving northward and westward. For decades men typically worked as farmers, teachers, and clergymen.\n\nStearns' father, Luther Stearns, was born on February 17, 1770, the eldest of five children born to Captain Josiah Stearns, a soldier in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He commanded a company of 50 men from [[Lunenburg, Massachusetts]]. Luther Stearns had entered Dartmouth College at age seventeen but transferred, graduating from Harvard in 1791. He worked as a tutor at Harvard and eventually studied medicine. He later became an obstetrician. He was honored in 1811 by an honorary degree from Harvard. <!-- Nice trick! Honorary degrees do not constitute certification for medical specialties -->\n\nAfter getting his practice started, Luther married Mary Hall of [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], on December 29, 1799; she was 16 years old, not an uncommon marrying age for women. They settled in  Medford, Massachusetts to be closer to her relatives. They had three children together: Elizabeth Hall, George Luther, and Henry Laurens Stearns (named after the American Ambassador of that name, a distant relative). The senior Stearns later opened a private preparatory school for boys in Medford; many students came from the American South and the West Indies.\n\nStearns died of pneumonia on April 27, 1820, when son George was eleven years old. To earn money, young George sometimes tended the locks on the Middlesex Canal in town.  At the age of 15, he entered the workforce to support his mother and sisters.\n\n===Career===\nIn early life, Stearns was engaged in the business of ship-chandlery. After a prosperous career, he began the manufacture of sheet and pipe-lead, doing business in [[Boston]] and residing in Medford.\n\nHe married Mary Elizabeth Preston on October 12, 1843. They met through acquaintances, including her father Warren Preston, a probate judge in Norridgewock, Maine; and [[Lydia Maria Child]], an American abolitionist and women's rights activist. \n\nBefore voting in the Missouri and Kansas territories about the future of slavery in each jurisdiction, Stearns was one of the chief financiers of the [[Emigrant Aid Company]]. It supported the settlement of [[Kansas]] by antislavery homesteaders. He identified with the [[Abolitionism in the United States|antislavery cause]], and became a [[Free Soil Party|Free-soiler]] in 1848. \n\nHe also established the Medford station of the [[Underground Railroad]] to help escaped refugee slaves to gain freedom (some continued to Canada, which had abolished slavery). Stearns was one of the \"[[Secret Six]]\" who aided [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] in [[Kansas]], and financially supported him for the raid on [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]]; Brown was executed for this attack. Stearns had owned the pikes and 200 [[Sharps rifle]]s taken to  Harpers Ferry by Brown and his followers. Following Brown's arrest, Stearns briefly fled to Canada but returned to Medford to face inquiry following Brown's execution.\n\nSoon after the opening of the Civil War, Stearns advocated the enlistment of African Americans in the Union Army. Massachusetts Governor [[John Albion Andrew|John Andrew]] asked Stearns to recruit the first two Northern state-sponsored black [[infantry]] [[regiment]]s. He contributed strongly to recruiting the enlistees of the [[54th Massachusetts Infantry|54th]] and [[55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|55th Massachusetts]] regiments and the 5th cavalry. \n\nStearns was commissioned as [[Major (United States)|major]] through the recommendation of [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]. Later he also enlisted  black soldiers for the [[United States Colored Troops|U.S. Colored Troops]]US Colored Troops from [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], and [[Tennessee]]. He is credited with recruiting more than 13,000 African Americans.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} He also established schools for their children and found work for their families while the men served in the army.\n\nStearns founded the ''Nation'', ''Commonwealth'', and ''Right Way'' newspapers for the dissemination of his ideas.<ref>James M. McPherson, ''The Struggle for Equality: Abolitionists and the Negro in the Civil War and Reconstruction'', Princeton University Press, 1964/new edition 2015</ref> \n\nAfter President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in January 1863, Stearns worked tirelessly for the [[civil rights]] of African Americans. Among his many admirers and friends were [[Louisa May Alcott]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Charles Sumner]], [[Frederick Douglass]], and President [[Andrew Johnson]]. He also helped to found the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], a federal organization designed to support emancipated African Americans ([[freedmen]]) in the South after the end of the war.\n\n\n==Death and legacy==\nStearns died of pneumonia in New York City, New York on April 9, 1867. [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] gave the [http://www.authorama.com/cambridge-sketches-16.html eulogy] at his funeral at the [[Unitarian Universalist Church of Medford and the Osgood House|First Parish Church in Medford]] ([[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]). \n\nWriter [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] published a poem in honor of Stearns in the May 1867 edition of the ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]]'', entitled \"G.L.S.\" It read, in part:<ref name=\"stearns\">{{cite book|last1=Stearns|first1=Frank Preston|title=The Life and Public Services of George Luther Stearns|year=1907|page=385-390|url=https://archive.org/stream/publicservices00stearich/publicservices00stearich_djvu.txt|access-date=23 July 2016}}</ref> \n\n\"No duty could overtask him;<br />\nNo need his will outrun;<br />\nOr ever our lips could ask him;<br />\nHis hands the work had done.\"\n\n\"A man who asked not to be great;<br />\nBut as he served and saved the state.\"\n\nIn 1897, a monument was erected on Boston Common to commemorate Colonel [[Robert Gould Shaw]] and the 54th Massachusetts regiment he commanded.
