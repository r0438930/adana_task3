Assam covers an area of {{convert|78438|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.

[[Shorea robusta|Sal tree]] forests are found in the state which, as a result of abundant rainfall, look green all year round.

The last of these rulers, also Naraka, was slain by [[Krishna]].  Naraka's son Bhagadatta became the king, who (it is mentioned in the Mahabharata) fought for the [[Kaurava]]s in the [[Kurukshetra War|battle of Kurukshetra]] with an army of ''[[kiratas]]'', ''[[chinas]]'' and ''dwellers of the eastern coast''.

Until the early 1500s, the Ahoms ruled a small kingdom in [[Sibsagar district]] and suddenly expanded during King Suhungmung's rule taking advantage of weakening rule of Chutia and Dimasa kingdoms. By 1681, the whole track down to the border of the modern district of Goalpara came permanently under their sway. Ahoms ruled for nearly 600 years (1228\u20131826 AD) with major expansions in the early 16th century at the cost of [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutia]] and [[Kachari kingdom|Dimasa Kachari]] kingdoms. Since c. the 13th century AD, the nerve centre of Ahom polity was upper Assam; the kingdom was gradually extended to the [[Karatoya River]] in the 17th or 18th century. It was at its zenith during the reign of [[Sukhrungphaa]] or Sworgodeu Rudra Sinha (c. 1696\u20131714 AD).\n\nThe Chutiya rulers (1187\u20131673 AD), a [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] group by origin, held the regions on both the banks of Brahmaputra with its domain in the area eastwards from [[Biswanath Chariali|Vishwanath]] (north bank) and [[Dihing River|Buridihing]] (south bank), in [[Upper Assam]] and in the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. It was partially annexed in the early 1500s by the Ahoms, finally getting absorbed in 1673 AD. The rivalry between the Chutiyas and Ahoms for the supremacy of eastern Assam led to a series of battles between them from the early 16th century until the start of the 17th century, which saw great loss of men and money.\n\nThe Koch, another [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] dynasty, established sovereignty in c. 1510 AD. The Koch kingdom in Western Assam and present-day [[North Bengal]] was at its zenith in the early reign of [[Nara Narayan]] (c. 1540\u20131587 AD). It split into two in c. 1581 CE, the western part as a [[Moghul]] vassal and the eastern as an Ahom satellite state. Later, in 1682, [[Koch Hajo]] was entirely annexed by the Ahoms.\n\nAmong other dynasties, the [[Kachari Kingdom|Dimasa]], another [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] dynasty, (13th century-1854 AD) ruled from Dikhow River to central and southern Assam and had their capital at [[Dimapur]]. With the expansion of Ahom kingdom, by the early 17th century, the Chutiya areas were annexed and since c. 1536 AD the Kacharis remained only in [[Cachar]] and [[North Cachar]], and more as an Ahom ally than a competing force.\n\nDespite numerous invasions, mostly by the Muslim rulers, no western power ruled Assam until the arrival of the British. Though the [[Mughal empire|Mughals]] made seventeen attempts to invade, they were never successful. The most successful invader [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]], a governor of [[Aurangzeb]], briefly occupied [[Garhgaon]] (c. 1662\u201363 AD), the then capital, but found it difficult to prevent [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] attacks on his forces, forcing them to leave. The decisive victory of the Assamese led by general [[Lachit Borphukan]] on the Mughals, then under command of Raja Ram Singha, in the [[Battle of Saraighat]] in 1671 almost ended Mughal ambitions in this region. The Mughals were comprehensively defeated in the [[Battle of Itakhuli]] and expelled from Lower Assam during the reign of [[Supaatphaa|Gadadhar Singha]] in 1682 AD.<ref>\"In the Battle of Itakhuli in September 1682, the Ahom forces chased the defeated Mughals nearly one hundred kilometers back to the Manas river.

Although the number of speakers is growing, the percentage of Assam's population who have it as a mother tongue has fallen slightly. The various Bengali dialects and closely related languages are spoken by around 9 million people in Assam, and the portion of the population that speaks these languages has grown slightly. Hindi is the third most-spoken language.\n\nTraditionally, Assamese was the language of the common folk in the ancient [[Kamarupa kingdom]] and in the medieval kingdoms of [[Kachari kingdom|Dimasa Kachari]], [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutiya Kachari]], Borahi Kachari, [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] and [[Koch kingdom|Koch Kachari Kingdom of Kamatapur]]. Traces of the language are found in many poems by Luipa, Sarahapa, and others, in [[Charyapada]] (c. 7th\u20138th century AD). Modern dialects such as Kamrupi and [[Goalpariya dialect|Goalpariya]] are remnants of this language. Moreover, Assamese in its traditional form was used by the ethno-cultural groups in the region as lingua-franca, which spread during the stronger kingdoms and was required for economic integration. Localised forms of the language still exist in Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nLinguistically modern Assamese traces its roots to the version developed by the American Missionaries based on the local form used near [[Sivasagar]] (Xiw\u00f4xag\u00f4r) district. Assamese (''\u00d4x\u00f4miya'') is a rich language due to its hybrid nature and unique characteristics of pronunciation and softness. The presence of [[Voiceless velar fricative]] in Assamese makes it a unique among other similar [[Indo-Aryan languages]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Das|first=Ankur|last2=Deka|first2=Tusmita|title=The Allophonic Variation of the Assamese voiceless velar fricative /x/|url=https://www.academia.edu/35777293}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Assamese.html|title=Assamese|website=www.languagesgulper.com|access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nBodo is an ancient language of Assam. Spatial distribution patterns of the ethno-cultural groups, cultural traits and the phenomenon of naming all the major rivers in the [[North-East India|North East Region]] with Bodo-Kachari words (e.g. [[Dihing]], Dibru, [[Dihong]], D/[[Teesta River|Tista]], and Dikrai) reveal that it was the most important language in ancient times. Bodo is now spoken largely in the Western Assam (BTAD). After years of neglect, now Bodo language is getting attention and its literature is developing. Other native languages of Tibeto-Burman origin and related to Bodo-Kachari are [[Deori language|Deori]], [[Mising language|Mising]], [[Karbi language|Karbi]], [[Rabha language|Rabha]], and [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThere are approximately 564,000 [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speakers spread all over the state forming about 2.12% of Assam's total population according to 2001 census.\n\nThere are speakers of [[Tai languages]] in Assam.

The Vaishanava Movement, the 15th century religio-cultural movement under the leadership of [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] (Sonkordeu) and his disciples have provided another dimension to Assamese culture. A renewed Hinduisation in local forms took place, which was initially greatly supported by the Koch and later by the Ahom Kingdoms. The resultant social institutions such as ''[[namghar]]'' and ''[[sattra]]'' (the Vaishnav Monasteries) have become part of the Assamese way of life. The movement contributed greatly towards language, literature, and performing and fine arts.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe modern culture has been influenced by events in the British and the post-British era. The language was standardised by American [[Baptist]] [[Missionary|Missionaries]] such as [[Nathan Brown (missionary)|Nathan Brown]], [[Miles Bronson and the Noctes|Dr. Miles Bronson]] and local pundits such as [[Hemchandra Barua]] with the form available in the [[Sibsagar]] (''Sivasagar'') District (the ex-nerve centre of the Ahom Kingdom).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIncreasing efforts of standardisation in the 20th century alienated the localised forms present in different areas and with the less-assimilated [[Ethnic groups|ethno-cultural groups]] (many source-cultures). However, Assamese culture in its hybrid form and nature is one of the richest, still developing and in true sense is a '[[cultural system]]' with sub-systems. Many source-cultures of the Assamese cultural-system are still surviving either as sub-systems or as sister entities, e.g. the; [[Bodo people|Bodo]] or [[Karbi people|Karbi]] or [[Mising people|Mishing]]. It is important to keep the broader system closer to its roots and at the same time focus on development of the sub-systems.\n\nSome of the common and unique cultural traits in the region are peoples' respect towards [[Betel nut|areca-nut]] and [[betel]] leaves, symbolic ([[gamosa]], arnai, etc.), [[Assam silk|traditional silk]] garments (e.g. [[mekhela chador]], traditional dress of Assamese women) and towards forefathers and elderly.

Various elements are used to represent beliefs, feelings, pride, identity, etc. ''Tamulpan'', ''[[Xorai]]'' and ''Gamosa'' are three important symbolic elements in Assamese culture. ''Tamulpan'' (the areca nut and betel leaves) or ''guapan'' (gua from ''kwa'') are considered along with the Gamosa (a typical woven cotton or silk cloth with embroidery) as the offers of devotion, respect and friendship. The Tamulpan-tradition is an ancient one and is being followed since time-immemorial with roots in the aboriginal Austric culture. ''[[Xorai]]'' is a traditionally manufactured bell-metal article of great respect and is used as a container-medium while performing respectful offers. Moreover, symbolically many ethno-cultural groups use specific clothes to portray respect and pride.\n\nThere were many other symbolic elements and designs, but are now only found in literature, art, sculpture, architecture, etc. or in use today for only religious purposes. The typical designs of ''Assamese-lion'', ''dragon'', and ''flying-lion'' were used for symbolising various purposes and occasions. The archaeological sites such as the Madan Kamdev (c. 9th\u201310th centuries AD) exhibits mass-scale use of lions, dragon-lions and many other figures of demons to show case power and prosperity. The Vaishnava monasteries and many other architectural sites of the late medieval period display the use of lions and dragons for symbolic effects.\n\n=== Festivals and traditions ===\n{{Main|List of festivals in Assam}}\n{{See also|Domahi|Bohag Bihu|Magh Bihu|Bwisagu}}\n[[File:Assamese Jaapi .jpg|thumb|upright|A beautifully adorned [[Jaapi]]]]\n[[File:Bihu dancer with a horn.jpg|thumb|upright|left|<center>A [[Bihu]] dancer blowing a ''[[pepa (musical instrument)|pepa]]'' (horn)</center>]]\n[[File:Ali-ai-ligang.jpg|thumb|''Tribal'' \u2013 Mising girls dancing during Ali Ai Ligang (Spring Festival)]]\nThere are diversified important traditional festivals in Assam.

Three Bihus, ''rongali'' or ''bohag'', celebrated with the coming of spring and the beginning of the sowing season; ''kongali'' or ''kati'', the barren bihu when the fields are lush but the barns are empty; and the ''[[Bhogali Bihu|bhogali]]'' or ''magh'', the thanksgiving when the crops have been harvested and the barns are full. Bihu songs and Bihu dance are associated to ''rongali'' bihu. The day before the each bihu is known as 'uruka'. The first day of 'rongali bihu' is called 'Goru bihu' (the bihu of the cows), when the cows are taken to the nearby rivers or ponds to be bathed with special care. In recent times the form and nature of celebration has changed with the growth of urban centres.\n\n[[Bwisagu]] is one of the popular seasonal festivals of the [[Bodo people|Bodos]]. Bwisagu start of the new year or age. Baisagu is a Boro word which originated from the word \"Baisa\" which means year or age, ang \"Agu\" that means starting or start.\n\nBeshoma is a festival of Deshi people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nenow.in/north-east-news/bihu-myriad-colours.html|title=Bihu \u2013 Its Myriad Colours|website=NORTHEAST NOW|language=en-US|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref> It is a celebration of sowing crop.

This festival is celebrated during the end of January. Officially 27 January has been declared as the day of Bushu Dima festival. The Dimasa people celebrate their festival by playing musical instruments- khram (a type of drum), muri (a kind of huge long flute). The people dances to the different tunes called \"murithai\" and each dance has got its name, the prominent being the \"Baidima\" There are three types of Bushu celebrated among the Dimasas Jidap, Surem and Hangsou.\n\nChavang Kut is a post harvesting festival of the [[Kuki people|Kuki]] people. The festival is celebrated on the first day of November every year. Hence, this particular day has been officially declared as a Restricted Holiday by the Assam government. In the past, the celebration was primarily important in the religio-cultural sense. The rhythmic movements of the dances in the festival were inspired by animals, agricultural techniques and showed their relationship with ecology. Today, the celebration witnesses the shifting of stages and is revamped to suit new contexts and interpretations. The traditional dances which form the core of the festival is now performed in out-of-village settings and are staged in a secular public sphere. In Assam, the Kukis mainly reside in the two autonomous districts of Dima Hasao and Karbi Anglong.\n\nMoreover, there are other important traditional festivals being celebrated every year on different occasions at different places. Many of these are celebrated by different ethno-cultural groups (sub and sister cultures).

Later, after weakening and disintegration (after the Kamarupa-Palas), the Kamarupa tradition was extended to c. 1255 AD by the Lunar I (c. 1120\u20131185 AD) and Lunar II (c. 1155\u20131255 AD) dynasties.<ref name=\"HKBarpujariCHOA\" />\n\n=== Medieval era ===\n{{further|Kamata kingdom|Koch dynasty|Ahom kingdom|Chutiya kingdom|Kachari kingdom|Baro-Bhuyan}}\nThe Ahoms, a [[Tai peoples|Tai]] group, ruled [[Upper Assam]]<ref>Banikanta Kakati, ''Assamese:Its formation and development''</ref> The Shans built their kingdom and consolidated their power in Eastern Assam with the modern town of [[Sibsagar]] as their capital. Until the early 1500s, the Ahoms ruled a small kingdom in [[Sibsagar district]] and suddenly expanded during King Suhungmung's rule taking advantage of weakening rule of Chutia and Dimasa kingdoms. By 1681, the whole track down to the border of the modern district of Goalpara came permanently under their sway. Ahoms ruled for nearly 600 years (1228\u20131826 AD) with major expansions in the early 16th century at the cost of [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutia]] and [[Kachari kingdom|Dimasa Kachari]] kingdoms. Since c. the 13th century AD, the nerve centre of Ahom polity was upper Assam; the kingdom was gradually extended to the [[Karatoya River]] in the 17th or 18th century. It was at its zenith during the reign of [[Sukhrungphaa]] or Sworgodeu Rudra Sinha (c. 1696\u20131714 AD).\n\nThe Chutiya rulers (1187\u20131673 AD), a [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] group by origin, held the regions on both the banks of Brahmaputra with its domain in the area eastwards from [[Biswanath Chariali|Vishwanath]] (north bank) and [[Dihing River|Buridihing]] (south bank), in [[Upper Assam]] and in the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. It was partially annexed in the early 1500s by the Ahoms, finally getting absorbed in 1673 AD. The rivalry between the Chutiyas and Ahoms for the supremacy of eastern Assam led to a series of battles between them from the early 16th century until the start of the 17th century, which saw great loss of men and money.\n\nThe Koch, another [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] dynasty, established sovereignty in c. 1510 AD. The Koch kingdom in Western Assam and present-day [[North Bengal]] was at its zenith in the early reign of [[Nara Narayan]] (c. 1540\u20131587 AD). It split into two in c. 1581 CE, the western part as a [[Moghul]] vassal and the eastern as an Ahom satellite state. Later, in 1682, [[Koch Hajo]] was entirely annexed by the Ahoms.\n\nAmong other dynasties, the [[Kachari Kingdom|Dimasa]], another [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] dynasty, (13th century-1854 AD) ruled from Dikhow River to central and southern Assam and had their capital at [[Dimapur]]. With the expansion of Ahom kingdom, by the early 17th century, the Chutiya areas were annexed and since c. 1536 AD the Kacharis remained only in [[Cachar]] and [[North Cachar]], and more as an Ahom ally than a competing force.\n\nDespite numerous invasions, mostly by the Muslim rulers, no western power ruled Assam until the arrival of the British. Though the [[Mughal empire|Mughals]] made seventeen attempts to invade, they were never successful. The most successful invader [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]], a governor of [[Aurangzeb]], briefly occupied [[Garhgaon]] (c. 1662\u201363 AD), the then capital, but found it difficult to prevent [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] attacks on his forces, forcing them to leave. The decisive victory of the Assamese led by general [[Lachit Borphukan]] on the Mughals, then under command of Raja Ram Singha, in the [[Battle of Saraighat]] in 1671 almost ended Mughal ambitions in this region. The Mughals were comprehensively defeated in the [[Battle of Itakhuli]] and expelled from Lower Assam during the reign of [[Supaatphaa|Gadadhar Singha]] in 1682 AD.<ref>\"In the Battle of Itakhuli in September 1682, the Ahom forces chased the defeated Mughals nearly one hundred kilometers back to the Manas river.

Although the number of speakers is growing, the percentage of Assam's population who have it as a mother tongue has fallen slightly. The various Bengali dialects and closely related languages are spoken by around 9 million people in Assam, and the portion of the population that speaks these languages has grown slightly. Hindi is the third most-spoken language.\n\nTraditionally, Assamese was the language of the common folk in the ancient [[Kamarupa kingdom]] and in the medieval kingdoms of [[Kachari kingdom|Dimasa Kachari]], [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutiya Kachari]], Borahi Kachari, [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] and [[Koch kingdom|Koch Kachari Kingdom of Kamatapur]]. Traces of the language are found in many poems by Luipa, Sarahapa, and others, in [[Charyapada]] (c. 7th\u20138th century AD). Modern dialects such as Kamrupi and [[Goalpariya dialect|Goalpariya]] are remnants of this language. Moreover, Assamese in its traditional form was used by the ethno-cultural groups in the region as lingua-franca, which spread during the stronger kingdoms and was required for economic integration. Localised forms of the language still exist in Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nLinguistically modern Assamese traces its roots to the version developed by the American Missionaries based on the local form used near [[Sivasagar]] (Xiw\u00f4xag\u00f4r) district. Assamese (''\u00d4x\u00f4miya'') is a rich language due to its hybrid nature and unique characteristics of pronunciation and softness. The presence of [[Voiceless velar fricative]] in Assamese makes it a unique among other similar [[Indo-Aryan languages]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Das|first=Ankur|last2=Deka|first2=Tusmita|title=The Allophonic Variation of the Assamese voiceless velar fricative /x/|url=https://www.academia.edu/35777293}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Assamese.html|title=Assamese|website=www.languagesgulper.com|access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nBodo is an ancient language of Assam. Spatial distribution patterns of the ethno-cultural groups, cultural traits and the phenomenon of naming all the major rivers in the [[North-East India|North East Region]] with Bodo-Kachari words (e.g. [[Dihing]], Dibru, [[Dihong]], D/[[Teesta River|Tista]], and Dikrai) reveal that it was the most important language in ancient times. Bodo is now spoken largely in the Western Assam (BTAD). After years of neglect, now Bodo language is getting attention and its literature is developing. Other native languages of Tibeto-Burman origin and related to Bodo-Kachari are [[Deori language|Deori]], [[Mising language|Mising]], [[Karbi language|Karbi]], [[Rabha language|Rabha]], and [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThere are approximately 564,000 [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speakers spread all over the state forming about 2.12% of Assam's total population according to 2001 census.\n\nThere are speakers of [[Tai languages]] in Assam.

The Vaishanava Movement, the 15th century religio-cultural movement under the leadership of [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] (Sonkordeu) and his disciples have provided another dimension to Assamese culture. A renewed Hinduisation in local forms took place, which was initially greatly supported by the Koch and later by the Ahom Kingdoms. The resultant social institutions such as ''[[namghar]]'' and ''[[sattra]]'' (the Vaishnav Monasteries) have become part of the Assamese way of life. The movement contributed greatly towards language, literature, and performing and fine arts.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe modern culture has been influenced by events in the British and the post-British era. The language was standardised by American [[Baptist]] [[Missionary|Missionaries]] such as [[Nathan Brown (missionary)|Nathan Brown]], [[Miles Bronson and the Noctes|Dr. Miles Bronson]] and local pundits such as [[Hemchandra Barua]] with the form available in the [[Sibsagar]] (''Sivasagar'') District (the ex-nerve centre of the Ahom Kingdom).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIncreasing efforts of standardisation in the 20th century alienated the localised forms present in different areas and with the less-assimilated [[Ethnic groups|ethno-cultural groups]] (many source-cultures). However, Assamese culture in its hybrid form and nature is one of the richest, still developing and in true sense is a '[[cultural system]]' with sub-systems. Many source-cultures of the Assamese cultural-system are still surviving either as sub-systems or as sister entities, e.g. the; [[Bodo people|Bodo]] or [[Karbi people|Karbi]] or [[Mising people|Mishing]]. It is important to keep the broader system closer to its roots and at the same time focus on development of the sub-systems.\n\nSome of the common and unique cultural traits in the region are peoples' respect towards [[Betel nut|areca-nut]] and [[betel]] leaves, symbolic ([[gamosa]], arnai, etc.), [[Assam silk|traditional silk]] garments (e.g. [[mekhela chador]], traditional dress of Assamese women) and towards forefathers and elderly. Moreover, great hospitality and bamboo culture are common.\n\n=== Symbols ===\n{{See also|List of Assam state symbols|Jaapi}}\n[[File:Bihu Assam.jpg|thumb|upright|<center>Girl in traditional [[Mekhela chador]] dress with a[[Dhol]] wrapped with Gamosa</center>]]\n[[File:Jaapi with Gamosa.jpg|thumb|upright|<center>A decorative Assamese ''[[Jaapi]]'' laid over a Gamosa</center>]]\nSymbolism is an ancient cultural practice in Assam and is still a very important part of the Assamese way of life. Various elements are used to represent beliefs, feelings, pride, identity, etc. ''Tamulpan'', ''[[Xorai]]'' and ''Gamosa'' are three important symbolic elements in Assamese culture. ''Tamulpan'' (the areca nut and betel leaves) or ''guapan'' (gua from ''kwa'') are considered along with the Gamosa (a typical woven cotton or silk cloth with embroidery) as the offers of devotion, respect and friendship. The Tamulpan-tradition is an ancient one and is being followed since time-immemorial with roots in the aboriginal Austric culture. ''[[Xorai]]'' is a traditionally manufactured bell-metal article of great respect and is used as a container-medium while performing respectful offers. Moreover, symbolically many ethno-cultural groups use specific clothes to portray respect and pride.\n\nThere were many other symbolic elements and designs, but are now only found in literature, art, sculpture, architecture, etc. or in use today for only religious purposes. The typical designs of ''Assamese-lion'', ''dragon'', and ''flying-lion'' were used for symbolising various purposes and occasions. The archaeological sites such as the Madan Kamdev (c. 9th\u201310th centuries AD) exhibits mass-scale use of lions, dragon-lions and many other figures of demons to show case power and prosperity. The Vaishnava monasteries and many other architectural sites of the late medieval period display the use of lions and dragons for symbolic effects.\n\n=== Festivals and traditions ===\n{{Main|List of festivals in Assam}}\n{{See also|Domahi|Bohag Bihu|Magh Bihu|Bwisagu}}\n[[File:Assamese Jaapi .jpg|thumb|upright|A beautifully adorned [[Jaapi]]]]\n[[File:Bihu dancer with a horn.jpg|thumb|upright|left|<center>A [[Bihu]] dancer blowing a ''[[pepa (musical instrument)|pepa]]'' (horn)</center>]]\n[[File:Ali-ai-ligang.jpg|thumb|''Tribal'' \u2013 Mising girls dancing during Ali Ai Ligang (Spring Festival)]]\nThere are diversified important traditional festivals in Assam. Bihu is the most important and common and celebrated all over Assam. It is the Assamese new year celebrated in April of the Gregorian calendar. [[Christmas]] is observed with great merriment by [[Christians]] of various denominations, including [[Catholics]] and [[Protestants]], throughout Assam. [[Durga Puja]], a festival introduced and popularised by [[Bengalis]], is widely celebrated across the state. Muslims celebrate two Eids ([[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]]) with much eagerness all over Assam.[[File:Sattriya by Dancer Meenakshi Medhi.JPG|thumb|[[Sattriya|Sattriya Dance]] ]]\n\n[[Bihu]] is a series of three prominent festivals. Primarily a non-religious festival celebrated to mark the seasons and the significant points of a cultivator's life over a yearly cycle. Three Bihus, ''rongali'' or ''bohag'', celebrated with the coming of spring and the beginning of the sowing season; ''kongali'' or ''kati'', the barren bihu when the fields are lush but the barns are empty; and the ''[[Bhogali Bihu|bhogali]]'' or ''magh'', the thanksgiving when the crops have been harvested and the barns are full. Bihu songs and Bihu dance are associated to ''rongali'' bihu. The day before the each bihu is known as 'uruka'. The first day of 'rongali bihu' is called 'Goru bihu' (the bihu of the cows), when the cows are taken to the nearby rivers or ponds to be bathed with special care. In recent times the form and nature of celebration has changed with the growth of urban centres.\n\n[[Bwisagu]] is one of the popular seasonal festivals of the [[Bodo people|Bodos]]. Bwisagu start of the new year or age. Baisagu is a Boro word which originated from the word \"Baisa\" which means year or age, ang \"Agu\" that means starting or start.\n\nBeshoma is a festival of Deshi people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nenow.in/north-east-news/bihu-myriad-colours.html|title=Bihu \u2013 Its Myriad Colours|website=NORTHEAST NOW|language=en-US|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref> It is a celebration of sowing crop.

This festival is celebrated during the end of January. Officially 27 January has been declared as the day of Bushu Dima festival. The Dimasa people celebrate their festival by playing musical instruments- khram (a type of drum), muri (a kind of huge long flute). The people dances to the different tunes called \"murithai\" and each dance has got its name, the prominent being the \"Baidima\" There are three types of Bushu celebrated among the Dimasas Jidap, Surem and Hangsou.\n\nChavang Kut is a post harvesting festival of the [[Kuki people|Kuki]] people. The festival is celebrated on the first day of November every year. Hence, this particular day has been officially declared as a Restricted Holiday by the Assam government. In the past, the celebration was primarily important in the religio-cultural sense. The rhythmic movements of the dances in the festival were inspired by animals, agricultural techniques and showed their relationship with ecology. Today, the celebration witnesses the shifting of stages and is revamped to suit new contexts and interpretations. The traditional dances which form the core of the festival is now performed in out-of-village settings and are staged in a secular public sphere. In Assam, the Kukis mainly reside in the two autonomous districts of Dima Hasao and Karbi Anglong.\n\nMoreover, there are other important traditional festivals being celebrated every year on different occasions at different places. Many of these are celebrated by different ethno-cultural groups (sub and sister cultures). Some of these are:\n{{columns | width = 180px | gap = 5px\n| col1 =\n* [[Me-Dam-Me-Phi]]\n* [[Ali Ai Ligang|Ali-Aye-Ligang]]\n* [[Rongker]]\n* Kherai\n* Garja\n* Bisu ([[Deori people|Deori]])\n| col2 =\n* Awnkham Gwrlwi Janai\n* Chojun/Swarak\n* Deusi Bhailo ( Traditional Nepalese songs that are sung during the festival of light \" Dipavali '' and also called \"Tihar\" )\n* Sokk-erroi\n* Hacha-kekan\n* Hapsa Hatarnai\n| col3 =\n* [[Porag]]\n* [[Bathow]]\n* [[Wangala]]\n* [[Bohuwa dance]]\n}}\n\nOther few yearly celebrations are Doul Utsav of Barpeta, [[Brahmaputra Beach Festival]], Guwahati, [[Kaziranga Elephant Festival]], Kaziranga and [[Dehing Patkai Festival]], Lekhapani, Karbi Youth Festival of Diphu and International Jatinga Festival, [[Jatinga]] can not be forgotten.
