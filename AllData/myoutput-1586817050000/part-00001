However between 1881 and 2001, it has clearly fluctuated throughout the decades, but yet eventually been reduced from 204 to 118, which could be judged as a significant reduction for such a small area. From the census data we know that the peak population was in 1901 where the population sat at 215 people however then started to drop in the later decades. In 2001 it reached its lowest point within the time period at 118, however it has begun to rise again, as in 2011 the population was recorded at 128, which is what it sits at now. The reason for the drop pre 2011 may be a consequence of improvements in travel allowing for more people to live in the urban areas. Despite this a growing trend for commuting has occurred in the last decade, which may be why the population is beginning to rise again.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Office For National Statistics|title=Key figures for 2011 census for Adforton: Population|url=https://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11119835&c=adforton&d=16&e=62&g=6386047&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1430046558908&enc=1|website=Neighbourhood Statistics|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Adforton population data 1881\u20131961|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10169744/cube/TOT_POP|website=www.visionofbritain.org.uk|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Occupational data from the 1881 census.==\nThe census data for 1881 shows us that agricultural work was the dominant occupation amongst males at the time, as 32 men worked on farms and with animals etc. However, there were men employed in other occupations such as Professional jobs, furniture designers and lodging. As for females, the data shows that most occupations (29) were unspecified and another six were unknown, but despite this the occupation with the most women employed in it was domestic services/ offices. Women did still work in agriculture but not as much as males. The culture at this present time was a significant influence on the structure of workforces.
