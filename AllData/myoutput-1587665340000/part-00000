The last outbreak occurred in 1551, after which the disease apparently vanished. The onset of symptoms was sudden, with death often occurring within hours. Its cause remains unknown, although it has been suggested that an unknown species of [[hantavirus pulmonary syndrome|hantavirus]] was responsible.\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n[[John Caius]] was a practising physician in Shrewsbury in 1551, when an outbreak occurred, and he described the symptoms and signs of the disease in ''A Boke or Counseill Against the Disease Commonly Called the Sweate, or Sweatyng Sicknesse'' (1552), which is the main historical source of knowledge of the disease. It began very suddenly with a sense of apprehension, followed by cold shivers (sometimes very violent), giddiness, headache, and severe pains in the neck, shoulders, and limbs, with great exhaustion. The cold stage might last from half an hour to three hours, after which the hot and sweating stage began. The characteristic sweat broke out suddenly without any obvious cause. A sense of heat, headache, [[delirium]], rapid pulse, and intense thirst accompanied the sweat. Palpitation and pain in the heart were frequent symptoms, as well. No skin eruptions were noted by observers, including Caius.  In the final stages, there was either general exhaustion and collapse, or an irresistible urge to sleep, which Caius thought was fatal if the patient were permitted to give way to it. One attack did not produce immunity, and some people suffered several bouts before dying.<ref name=Heyman2014>{{cite journal|authors=Heyman P. & Simons L. & Cochez, C. |title=Were the English Sweating Sickness and the Picardy Sweat Caused by Hantaviruses?|journal= Viruses|date= 2014|volume=6|number=1|pages=151\u2013171|doi=10.3390/v6010151|pmid=24402305 |pmc=3917436}}</ref> The disease tended to occur in summer and early autumn.\n\n== Cause ==\nThe cause is the most mysterious aspect of the disease. Commentators then and now put much blame on the sewage, generally poor sanitation, and contaminated water supplies of the time, which might have harboured the source of infection. The first confirmed outbreak was in August 1485 at the end of the [[Wars of the Roses]], which has led to speculation that it may have been brought over from France by the French mercenaries whom [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] used to gain the English throne.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Theilmann |first1=John M. |editor1-last=Byrnes |editor1-first=Joseph P. |title=Encyclopedia of pestilence, pandemics, and plagues |date=2008 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0313341014 |page=686, \"Sweating Sickness\" |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fg5hDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA686}}</ref> However, an earlier outbreak may have affected the city of York in June 1485, before Tudor's army landed, although the record of that disease's symptoms is not adequate to be certain.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Petre |first1=James |title=Richard III crown and people |date=1985 |publisher=Sutton Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-0904893113 |page=383 |quote=A 'plage of pestilence' was known in York as early as June 1485, but no symptoms were described, and we cannot tell what gave [Sir Thomas] Stanley the idea to cite the sweating sickness.}}</ref> Regardless, the ''[[Croyland Chronicle]]'' mentions that [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]] used the sweating sickness as an excuse not to join with [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]'s army prior to Tudor's victory over Richard at the [[Battle of Bosworth]].<ref name=Heyman2014/>\n\n[[Relapsing fever]] has been proposed as a possible cause. This disease is spread by ticks and lice, and it occurs most often during the summer months, as did the original sweating sickness. However, relapsing fever is marked by a prominent black scab at the site of the tick bite and a subsequent skin rash.\n\nSeveral researchers have noted that symptoms overlap with [[hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]] and have proposed an unknown [[hantavirus]] as the cause.<ref name=Heyman2014/><ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=9023099|year=1997|last1=Thwaites|first1=G|last2=Taviner|first2=M|last3=Gant|first3=V|title=The English sweating sickness, 1485 to 1551|volume=336|issue=8|pages=580\u20132|doi=10.1056/NEJM199702203360812|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmc=1043971|year=1998|last1=Taviner|first1=M|last2=Thwaites|first2=G|last3=Gant|first3=V|title=The English sweating sickness, 1485-1551: A viral pulmonary disease?|volume=42|issue=1|pages=96\u201398|journal=Medical History|doi=10.1017/S0025727300063365|pmid=9536626}}</ref> A critique of this hypothesis argued that sweating sickness was thought to be transmitted from human to human, whereas hantaviruses are rarely spread that way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3874/is_200101/ai_n8939673  |title=English 'sweate' (Sudor Anglicus) and Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, The |publisher=British Journal of Biomedical Science |year=2001 |last=Bridson |first= Eric}}</ref> However, infection via human contact has been suggested in hantavirus outbreaks in Argentina.<ref name=\"Padula\">{{cite journal|last1=Padula|first1=P|last2=Edelstein|first2=A|last3=Miguel|first3=SD|last4=L\u00f3pez|first4=NM|last5=Rossi|first5=CM|last6=Rabinovich |first6=RD|date=15 February 1998|title=Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome outbreak in Argentina: molecular evidence for person-to-person transmission of Andes virus|journal=Virology|publisher=Elsevier|location=London|volume=241|issue=2|pages=323\u2013330|doi=10.1006/viro.1997.8976|pmid=9499807}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, microbiologist Edward McSweegan suggested that the disease may have been an outbreak of [[anthrax]] poisoning.

It was regarded as being quite distinct from the [[Black Death]], the pestilential fever, or other epidemics previously known because of the sweating which gave it its name and its extremely rapid and fatal course.

The last outbreak occurred in 1551, after which the disease apparently vanished. The onset of symptoms was sudden, with death often occurring within hours. Its cause remains unknown, although it has been suggested that an unknown species of [[hantavirus pulmonary syndrome|hantavirus]] was responsible.\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n[[John Caius]] was a practising physician in Shrewsbury in 1551, when an outbreak occurred, and he described the symptoms and signs of the disease in ''A Boke or Counseill Against the Disease Commonly Called the Sweate, or Sweatyng Sicknesse'' (1552), which is the main historical source of knowledge of the disease. It began very suddenly with a sense of apprehension, followed by cold shivers (sometimes very violent), giddiness, headache, and severe pains in the neck, shoulders, and limbs, with great exhaustion. The cold stage might last from half an hour to three hours, after which the hot and sweating stage began. The characteristic sweat broke out suddenly without any obvious cause. A sense of heat, headache, [[delirium]], rapid pulse, and intense thirst accompanied the sweat. Palpitation and pain in the heart were frequent symptoms, as well. No skin eruptions were noted by observers, including Caius.  In the final stages, there was either general exhaustion and collapse, or an irresistible urge to sleep, which Caius thought was fatal if the patient were permitted to give way to it. One attack did not produce immunity, and some people suffered several bouts before dying.<ref name=Heyman2014>{{cite journal|authors=Heyman P. & Simons L. & Cochez, C. |title=Were the English Sweating Sickness and the Picardy Sweat Caused by Hantaviruses?|journal= Viruses|date= 2014|volume=6|number=1|pages=151\u2013171|doi=10.3390/v6010151|pmid=24402305 |pmc=3917436}}</ref> The disease tended to occur in summer and early autumn.\n\n== Cause ==\nThe cause is the most mysterious aspect of the disease. Commentators then and now put much blame on the sewage, generally poor sanitation, and contaminated water supplies of the time, which might have harboured the source of infection. The first confirmed outbreak was in August 1485 at the end of the [[Wars of the Roses]], which has led to speculation that it may have been brought over from France by the French mercenaries whom [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] used to gain the English throne.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Theilmann |first1=John M. |editor1-last=Byrnes |editor1-first=Joseph P. |title=Encyclopedia of pestilence, pandemics, and plagues |date=2008 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0313341014 |page=686, \"Sweating Sickness\" |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fg5hDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA686}}</ref> However, an earlier outbreak may have affected the city of York in June 1485, before Tudor's army landed, although the record of that disease's symptoms is not adequate to be certain.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Petre |first1=James |title=Richard III crown and people |date=1985 |publisher=Sutton Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-0904893113 |page=383 |quote=A 'plage of pestilence' was known in York as early as June 1485, but no symptoms were described, and we cannot tell what gave [Sir Thomas] Stanley the idea to cite the sweating sickness.}}</ref> Regardless, the ''[[Croyland Chronicle]]'' mentions that [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]] used the sweating sickness as an excuse not to join with [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]'s army prior to Tudor's victory over Richard at the [[Battle of Bosworth]].<ref name=Heyman2014/>\n\n[[Relapsing fever]] has been proposed as a possible cause. This disease is spread by ticks and lice, and it occurs most often during the summer months, as did the original sweating sickness. However, relapsing fever is marked by a prominent black scab at the site of the tick bite and a subsequent skin rash.\n\nSeveral researchers have noted that symptoms overlap with [[hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]] and have proposed an unknown [[hantavirus]] as the cause.<ref name=Heyman2014/><ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=9023099|year=1997|last1=Thwaites|first1=G|last2=Taviner|first2=M|last3=Gant|first3=V|title=The English sweating sickness, 1485 to 1551|volume=336|issue=8|pages=580\u20132|doi=10.1056/NEJM199702203360812|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmc=1043971|year=1998|last1=Taviner|first1=M|last2=Thwaites|first2=G|last3=Gant|first3=V|title=The English sweating sickness, 1485-1551: A viral pulmonary disease?|volume=42|issue=1|pages=96\u201398|journal=Medical History|doi=10.1017/S0025727300063365|pmid=9536626}}</ref> A critique of this hypothesis argued that sweating sickness was thought to be transmitted from human to human, whereas hantaviruses are rarely spread that way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3874/is_200101/ai_n8939673  |title=English 'sweate' (Sudor Anglicus) and Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, The |publisher=British Journal of Biomedical Science |year=2001 |last=Bridson |first= Eric}}</ref> However, infection via human contact has been suggested in hantavirus outbreaks in Argentina.<ref name=\"Padula\">{{cite journal|last1=Padula|first1=P|last2=Edelstein|first2=A|last3=Miguel|first3=SD|last4=L\u00f3pez|first4=NM|last5=Rossi|first5=CM|last6=Rabinovich |first6=RD|date=15 February 1998|title=Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome outbreak in Argentina: molecular evidence for person-to-person transmission of Andes virus|journal=Virology|publisher=Elsevier|location=London|volume=241|issue=2|pages=323\u2013330|doi=10.1006/viro.1997.8976|pmid=9499807}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, microbiologist Edward McSweegan suggested that the disease may have been an outbreak of [[anthrax]] poisoning.
