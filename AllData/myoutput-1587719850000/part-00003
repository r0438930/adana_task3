Furthermore, the [[monetary authority]] of a country, such as the [[central bank]], can influence the availability and cost for money through its [[monetary policy]].\n\nIn addition to theories of unemployment, a few categorisations of unemployment are used for more precisely [[Conceptual model|modelling]] the effects of unemployment within the economic system. Some of the main types of unemployment include [[structural unemployment]], [[frictional unemployment]], [[cyclical unemployment]], [[involuntary unemployment]] and [[classical unemployment]]. [[Unemployment types#Structural unemployment|Structural unemployment]] focuses on foundational problems in the economy and inefficiencies inherent in labor markets, including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skill sets. Structural arguments emphasize causes and solutions related to [[disruptive technology|disruptive technologies]] and [[globalization]]. Discussions of [[frictional unemployment]] focus on voluntary decisions to work based on individuals' valuation of their own work and how that compares to current wage rates added to the time and effort required to find a job. Causes and solutions for frictional unemployment often address job entry threshold and wage rates.\n\nGlobally, 172 million people globally or 5% of the reported workforce of the world were without a job in 2018, according to the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ilo.org/ilostat/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pagehierarchy/Page3.jspx?MBI_ID=2&locale=en&_afrLoop=1809645378580656&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null#!%40%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26locale%3Den%26_afrLoop%3D1809645378580656%26MBI_ID%3D2%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dsxm9jfbzq_21|title=International Labour Organization: Unemployment rate}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the difficulty to measure the unemployment rate by for example using surveys like in the [[United States]] or through registered unemployed citizens like in some countries in [[Europe]] countries, statistical figures such as the [[employment-to-population ratio]] could be better suited to evaluate the status of the [[workforce]] and the [[economy]] if they would be based on people who are registered as, for example, [[taxpayer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/crs-implementation-and-assistance/tax-identification-numbers/ |title=OECD TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS}}</ref>\n\n==Definitions, types, and theories==\nThe state of being without any work yet looking for work is called unemployment. Economists distinguish between various overlapping types of and theories of unemployment, including [[#Cyclical or Keynesian theory of unemployment|cyclical or Keynesian unemployment]], [[frictional unemployment]], [[structural unemployment]] and [[classical unemployment]]. Some additional types of unemployment that are occasionally mentioned are seasonal unemployment, hardcore unemployment, and hidden unemployment.\n\nThough there have been several definitions of \"voluntary\" and \"[[involuntary unemployment]]\" in the economics literature, a simple distinction is often applied. Voluntary unemployment is attributed to the individual's decisions, but involuntary unemployment exists because of the socio-economic environment (including the market structure, government intervention, and the level of aggregate demand) in which individuals operate. In these terms, much or most of [[frictional unemployment]] is voluntary since it reflects individual search behavior. Voluntary unemployment includes workers who reject low-wage jobs, but involuntary unemployment includes workers fired because of an economic crisis, [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]], company bankruptcy, or organizational restructuring.\n\nOn the other hand, cyclical unemployment, structural unemployment, and classical unemployment are largely involuntary in nature. However, the existence of structural unemployment may reflect choices made by the unemployed in the past, and classical (natural) unemployment may result from the legislative and economic choices made by labour unions or political parties.\n\nThe clearest cases of involuntary unemployment are those with fewer job vacancies than unemployed workers even when wages are allowed to adjust and so even if all vacancies were to be filled, some unemployed workers would still remain. That happens with cyclical unemployment, as macroeconomic forces cause microeconomic unemployment, which can boomerang back and exacerbate those macroeconomic forces.\n\n===Classical unemployment===\nClassical, or real-wage, unemployment, occurs when real wages for a job are set above the [[market-clearing]] level, causing the number of job-seekers to exceed the number of vacancies. On the other hand, most economists argue that as wages fall below a livable wage, many choose to drop out of the labor market and no longer seek employment. That is especially true in countries in which low-income families are supported through public welfare systems. In such cases, wages would have to be high enough to motivate people to choose employment over what they receive through public welfare. Wages below a livable wage are likely to result in lower labor market participation in the above-stated scenario. In addition, consumption of goods and services is the primary driver of increased [[demand for labor]]. Higher wages lead to workers having more income available to consume goods and services. Therefore, higher wages increase general consumption and as a result demand for labor increases and unemployment decreases.\n\nMany economists have argued that unemployment increases with increased governmental regulation. For example, [[minimum wage]] laws raise the cost of some low-skill laborers above market equilibrium, resulting in increased unemployment as people who wish to work at the going rate cannot (as the new and higher enforced wage is now greater than the value of their labour).<ref>{{cite book |first=F.

Some associate cyclical unemployment with frictional unemployment because the factors that cause the friction are partially caused by cyclical variables. For example, a surprise decrease in the money supply may suddenly inhibit aggregate demand and thus inhibit [[labor demand]].\n\n[[Keynesian]] economists, on the other hand, see the lack of supply of jobs as potentially resolvable by government intervention. One suggested intervention involves [[deficit spending]] to boost employment and goods demand. Another intervention involves an expansionary [[monetary policy]] to increase  the [[supply of money]], which should reduce [[interest rate]]s, which, in turn, should lead to an increase in non-governmental spending.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|first = Seymour E.\n|last=Harris\n|title=The New Economics: Keynes' Influence on Theory and Public Policy\n|year=2005\n|isbn=978-1-4191-4534-6\n|publisher= Kessinger Publishing}}\n</ref>\n\n===Full unemployment===\n{{Main|Full employment}}\n[[File:NAIRU-SR-and-LR.svg|thumb|right|Short-Run [[Phillips Curve]] before and after Expansionary Policy, with Long-Run Phillips Curve (NAIRU). Note, however, that the unemployment rate is an inaccurate predictor of inflation in the long term.<ref name=chang/><ref name=hossfeld/>]]\n\nIn demand-based theory, it is possible to abolish cyclical unemployment by increasing the aggregate demand for products and workers. However, the economy eventually hits an \"[[inflation]] barrier\" that is imposed by the four other kinds of unemployment to the extent that they exist. Historical experience suggests that low unemployment affects inflation in the short term but not the long term.<ref name=chang>Chang, R. (1997) [https://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/ACFC7.pdf \"Is Low Unemployment Inflationary?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113212953/https://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/ACFC7.pdf |date=13 November 2013}} ''Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Economic Review'' 1Q97:4\u201313</ref> In the long term, the [[velocity of money]] supply measures such as the MZM (\"money zero maturity\", representing cash and equivalent [[demand deposit]]s) velocity is far more predictive of inflation than low unemployment.<ref name=hossfeld>Oliver Hossfeld (2010) [https://web.archive.org/web/20131113215511/http://www.hhl.de/fileadmin/texte/publikationen/forschungspapiere/HOSSFELD_USMONEY_INFERWP_2010-4.pdf \"US Money Demand, Monetary Overhang, and Inflation Prediction\"] ''International Network for Economic Research'' working paper no. 2010.4</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MZMV |title=MZM velocity |publisher=Research.stlouisfed.org |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nSome demand theory economists see the inflation barrier as corresponding to the [[natural rate of unemployment]]. The \"natural\" rate of unemployment is defined as the rate of unemployment that exists when the labour market is in equilibrium, and there is pressure for neither rising inflation rates nor falling inflation rates. An alternative technical term for that rate is the [[NAIRU]], the ''Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment''. Whatever its name, demand theory holds that if the unemployment rate gets \"too low,\" inflation will accelerate in the absence of wage and price controls (incomes policies).\n\nOne of the major problems with the NAIRU theory is that no one knows exactly what the NAIRU is, and it clearly changes over time.<ref name=chang/> The margin of error can be quite high relative to the actual unemployment rate, making it hard to use the NAIRU in policy-making.<ref name=hossfeld/>\n\nAnother, normative, definition of full employment might be called the ''ideal'' unemployment rate. It would exclude all types of unemployment that represent forms of inefficiency. This type of \"full employment\" unemployment would correspond to only frictional unemployment (excluding that part encouraging the [[McJob]]s management strategy) and so would be very low. However, it would be impossible to attain this full-employment target using only demand-side [[Keynesian]] stimulus without getting below the NAIRU and causing accelerating inflation (absent incomes policies). Training programs aimed at fighting structural unemployment would help here.\n\nTo the extent that hidden unemployment exists, it implies that official unemployment statistics provide a poor guide to what unemployment rate coincides with \"full employment.\"<ref name=chang/>\n\n===Structural unemployment===\n{{Main|Structural unemployment}}\n[[File:Okuns law quarterly differences.svg|thumb|[[Okun's Law]] interprets unemployment as a function of the rate of growth in GDP.]]\n[[Structural unemployment]] occurs when a labour market is unable to provide jobs for everyone who wants one because there is a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed workers and the skills needed for the available jobs. Structural unemployment is hard to separate empirically from frictional unemployment except that it lasts longer. As with frictional unemployment, simple demand-side stimulus will not work to abolish this type of unemployment easily.\n\nStructural unemployment may also be encouraged to rise by persistent cyclical unemployment: if an economy suffers from longlasting low aggregate demand, it means that many of the unemployed become disheartened, and their skills (including [[job hunting|job-searching]] skills) become \"rusty\" and obsolete. Problems with debt may lead to [[homelessness]] and a fall into the vicious circle of poverty.\n\nThat means that they may not fit the job vacancies that are created when the economy recovers. The implication is that sustained ''high'' demand may ''lower'' structural unemployment. This theory of persistence in structural unemployment has been referred to as an example of [[path dependence]] or \"[[hysteresis]].\"\n\nMuch ''[[technological unemployment]]'',<ref name=\"Jerome 1934\"/> caused by the replacement of workers by machines might be counted as structural unemployment. Alternatively, technological unemployment might refer to the way in which steady increases in labour productivity mean that fewer workers are needed to produce the same level of output every year. The fact that aggregate demand can be raised to deal with the problem suggests that the problem is instead one of cyclical unemployment. As indicated by [[Okun's law]], the demand side must grow sufficiently quickly to absorb not only the growing labour force but also the workers who are made redundant by the increased labour productivity.\n\nSeasonal unemployment may be seen as a kind of structural unemployment since it is linked to certain kinds of jobs (construction and migratory farm work). The most-cited official unemployment measures erase this kind of unemployment from the statistics using \"seasonal adjustment\" techniques. That results in substantial and permanent structural unemployment.\n\n===Frictional unemployment===\n{{Main|Frictional unemployment}}\n[[File:US beveridge 2004 through fall 2010.gif|thumb|The [[Beveridge curve]] of 2004 [[vacancy (economics)|job vacancy]] and unemployment rate from the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics.]]\n\nFrictional unemployment is the time period between jobs in which a worker [[search theory|searches]] for or transitions from one job to another. It is sometimes called ''search unemployment'' and can be voluntary, based on the circumstances of the unemployed individual. Frictional unemployment exists because both jobs and workers are [[heterogeneity in economics|heterogeneous]], and a mismatch can result between the characteristics of supply and demand. Such a mismatch can be related to skills, payment, work-time, location, seasonal industries, attitude, taste, and a multitude of other factors. New entrants (such as graduating students) and re-entrants (such as former homemakers) can also suffer a spell of frictional unemployment.\n\nWorkers and employers accept a certain level of imperfection, risk or compromise, but usually not right away. They will invest some time and effort to find a better match. That is, in fact, beneficial to the economy since it results in a better allocation of resources. However, if the search takes too long and mismatches are too frequent, the economy suffers since some work will not get done. Therefore, governments will seek ways to reduce unnecessary frictional unemployment by multiple means including providing education, advice, training, and assistance such as [[daycare center]]s.\n\nThe frictions in the [[labour market]] are sometimes illustrated graphically with a [[Beveridge curve]], a downward-sloping, convex curve that shows a correlation between the unemployment rate on one axis and the vacancy rate on the other. Changes in the supply of or demand for labour cause movements along the curve. An increase or decrease in labour market frictions will shift the curve outwards or inwards.\n\n===Hidden unemployment===\nOfficial statistics often underestimate unemployment rates because of hidden, or covered, unemployment. That is the unemployment of potential workers that are not reflected in official unemployment statistics because of how the statistics are collected. In many countries, only those who have no work but are actively looking for work and/or qualifying for social security benefits are counted as unemployed. Those who have given up looking for work and sometimes those who are on government \"retraining\" programs are not officially counted among the unemployed even though they are not employed. \n\nHidden unemployment often is caused by the state's deliberate manipulations to make statistics about the country look better especially for international propaganda purposes, as wad a common practice in the Soviet Union and its satellite states under the Warsaw Pact. Especially in those countries, it is often referred to as agrarian unemployment since it often occurred in agricultural sectors, mostly in rural areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://forsal.pl/finansopedia/inne/hasla/912046,bezrobocie-ukryte.html|title=Bezrobocie ukryte - Encyklopedia Gazety Prawnej|website=forsal.pl|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref> It was commonly done in a form of early retirement because of lack of vacant jobs for those who had not reached the retirement age or often a situation in which increasing the number of employees did not increase the production (creating fake vacancies on paper for people with whom they did not know what to do, how to use their potential workforce but not admitting to that inability and paying out the diminutive wages for them to pretend to work and remain silent), thus rendering the overall productivity close to zero. It was a very common problem and one of the main reasons for the economic crisis leading to the common people's strikes that later on led to governments responding with martial law state in places like Poland, and the eventual downfall of USSR and Soviet occupation over the rest of the subjugated states under the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe statistic also does not count the \"[[underemployment|underemployed]],\" yhose working fewer hours than they would prefer or in a job that fails to make good use of their capabilities. In addition, those who are of working age but are currently in full-time education are usually not considered unemployed in government statistics. Traditional unemployed native societies who survive by gathering, hunting, herding, and farming in wilderness areas may or may not be counted in unemployment statistics.\n\n===Long-term unemployment===\n'''Long-term unemployment''' (LTU) is defined in [[European Union]] statistics as unemployment lasting for longer than one year (while unemployment lasting over two years is defined as ''very long-term unemployment''). The United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS), which reports current long-term unemployment rate at 1.9 percent, defines this as unemployment lasting 27 weeks or longer. Long-term unemployment is a component of [[structural unemployment]], which results in long-term unemployment existing in every social group, industry, occupation, and all levels of education.<ref>{{Citation |last=Bivens |first= Josh |last2=Shierholz |first2=Heidi |title=Lagging Demand, Not Unemployability, Is Why Long-term Unemployment Remains So High |publisher=Economic Policy Institute |url=http://www.epi.org/publication/lagging-demand-is-behind-high-long-term-unemployment/}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 the European Commission published recommendations on how to reduce long-term unemployment.<ref>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016H0220%2801%29&qid=1456753373365</ref> These advised governments to:\n\n* encourage long-term unemployed people to '''register''' with an [[Public employment service|employment service]];\n* provide each registered long-term unemployed person with an '''individual in-depth assessment''' to identify their needs and potential within 18 months;\n* offer a tailor-made '''job integration agreement''' (JIA) to all registered long-term unemployed within 18 months. These might include measures such as [[Mentorship|mentoring]], help with [[Job hunting|job search]], [[further education]] and training, support for housing, transport, child and care services and rehabilitation. Each person would have a single point of contact to access this support, which would be implemented in partnership with employers.\n\nIn 2017\u20132019 it implemented the Long-Term Unemployment project to research solutions implemented by EU member states and produce a toolkit<ref>https://ec.europa.eu/esf/transnationality/ltu-project</ref> to guide government action.

According to [[Karl Marx]], unemployment is inherent within the unstable capitalist system and periodic crises of mass unemployment are to be expected.

Retrieved 22 July 2007.</ref>\n* ''Labour Force Sample Surveys'' are the most preferred method of unemployment rate calculation since they give the most comprehensive results and enables calculation of unemployment by different group categories such as race and gender. This method is the most internationally comparable.\n* ''Official Estimates'' are determined by a combination of information from one or more of the other three methods. The use of this method has been declining in favor of labour surveys.\n* ''Social Insurance Statistics'', such as unemployment benefits, are computed base on the number of persons insured representing the total labour force and the number of persons who are insured that are collecting benefits. This method has been heavily criticized because if the expiration of benefits before the person finds work.\n* ''Employment Office Statistics'' are the least effective since they include only a monthly tally of unemployed persons who enter employment offices. This method also includes those who are not unemployed by the ILO definition.\n\nThe primary measure of unemployment, U3, allows for comparisons between countries. Unemployment differs from country to country and across different time periods. For example, in the 1990s and 2000s, the United States had lower unemployment levels than many countries in the [[European Union]],<ref>Schmitt, John; Rho, Hye Jin; Fremstad, Shawn.

That can impact non-industrialized economies, such as the United States and Europe in the early 19th century, since overall unemployment was approximately 3% because so many individuals were self-employed, independent farmers; however, non-agricultural unemployment was as high as 80%.<ref name=\"Lebergott1964\"/>\n\nMany economies industrialize and so experience increasing numbers of non-agricultural workers. For example, the United States' non-agricultural labour force increased from 20% in 1800 to 50% in 1850 and  97% in 2000.<ref name=\"Lebergott1964\"/> The shift away from self-employment increases the percentage of the population that is included in unemployment rates. When unemployment rates between countries or time periods are compared, it is best to consider differences in their levels of industrialization and self-employment.\n\nAdditionally, the measures of employment and unemployment may be \"too high.\" In some countries, the availability of [[unemployment benefits]] can inflate statistics by giving an incentive to register as unemployed. People who do not seek work may choose to declare themselves unemployed to get benefits; people with undeclared paid occupations may try to get unemployment benefits in addition to the money that they earn from their work.<ref name=\"Reporting benefit fraud.\">{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/BenefitsTaxCreditsAndOtherSupport/BenefitFraud/DG_10014876 |title=Reporting benefit fraud |publisher=Directgov |accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Japan, and the European Union, unemployment is measured using a sample survey (akin to a [[Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll).<ref name=\"ilo.org\"/> According to the BLS, a number of Eastern European nations have instituted labour force surveys as well. The sample survey has its own problems because the total number of workers in the economy is calculated based on a sample, rather than a census.\n\nIt is possible to be neither employed nor unemployed by ILO definitions by being outside of the \"labour force.\"<ref name=\"sfgate.com\"/> Such people have no job and are not looking for one. Many of them go to school or are retired. Family responsibilities keep others out of the labour force. Still others have a physical or mental disability that prevents them from participating in the labour force. Some people simply elect not to work and prefer to be dependent on others for sustenance.\n\nTypically, employment and the labour force include only work that is done for monetary gain. Hence, a [[homemaker]] is neither part of the labour force nor unemployed. Also, full-time students and prisoners are considered to be neither part of the labour force nor unemployed.<ref name=\"Krueger 1999\"/> The number of prisoners can be important. In 1999, economists Lawrence F. Katz and Alan B. Krueger estimated that increased incarceration lowered measured unemployment in the United States by 0.17% between 1985 and the late 1990s.<ref name=\"Krueger 1999\"/>\n\nIn particular, as of 2005, roughly 0.7% of the US population is incarcerated (1.5% of the available working population). Additionally, children, the elderly, and some individuals with disabilities are typically not counted as part of the labour force and so are not included in the unemployment statistics. However, some elderly and many disabled individuals are active in the labour market.\n\nIn the early stages of an [[boom and bust|economic boom]], unemployment often rises.<ref name=\"Keynes 2007\"/> That is because people join the labour market (give up studying, start a job hunt, etc.) as a result of the improving job market, but until they have actually found a position, they are counted as unemployed. Similarly, during a [[recession]], the increase in the unemployment rate is moderated by people leaving the labour force or being otherwise discounted from the labour force, such as with the self-employed.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2004, according to [[OECD]] ([http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/36/30/35024561.pdf Employment Outlook 2005] {{ISBN|92-64-01045-9}}), normalized unemployment for men aged 25 to 54 was 4.6% in the US and 7.4% in France.

Men are represented in light blue, women in pink, and the total in black.]]\nThe labor force participation rate is the ratio between the [[labor force]] and the overall size of their [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] (national population of the same age range). In the West, during the later half of the 20th century, the labor force participation rate increased significantly because of an increase in the number of women entering the workplace.\n\nIn the United States, there have been four significant stages of women's participation in the labour force: increases in the 20th century and decreases in the 21st century. Male labor force participation decreased from 1953 to 2013. Since October 2013, men have been increasingly joining the labour force.\n\nFrom the late 19th century to the 1920s, very few women worked outside the home. They were young single women who typically withdrew from the labor force at marriage unless family needed two incomes. Such women worked primarily in the [[textile manufacturing]] industry or as [[domestic worker]]s. That profession empowered women and allowed them to earn a living wage. At times, they were a financial help to their families.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1950, female labor force participation increased primarily because of the increased demand for office workers, women's participation in the high school movement, and [[electrification]], which reduced the time that was spent on household chores. Between the 1950s to the early 1970s, most women were secondary earners working mainly as secretaries, teachers, nurses, and librarians ([[pink-collar]] jobs).\n\nFrom the mid-1970s to the late 1990s, there was a period of revolution of women in the labor force brought on by various factors, many of which arose from the [[second-wave feminism]] movement. Women more accurately planned for their future in the work force by investing in more applicable majors in college that prepared them to enter and compete in the labor market. In the United States, the female labor force participation rate rose from approximately 33% in 1948 to a peak of 60.3% in 2000. As of April 2015, the female labor force participation is at 56.6%, the male labor force participation rate is at 69.4%, and the total is 62.8%.<ref name=\"research.stlouisfed.org\">[https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LNS11300002 Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate: Women] Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</ref>\n\nA common theory in modern economics claims that the rise of women participating in the US labor force in the 1950s to the 1990s was caused by the introduction of a new contraceptive technology, [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pills]], as well as the adjustment of [[age of majority]] laws. The use of birth control gave women the flexibility of opting to invest and to advance their career while they maintained a relationship. By having control over the timing of their fertility, they were not running a risk of thwarting their career choices. However, only 40% of the population actually used the birth control pill.\n\nThat implies that other factors may have contributed to women choosing to invest in advancing their careers. One factor may be that more and more men delayed the age of marriage, which allowef women to marry later in life without them worrying about the quality of older men. Other factors include the changing nature of work, with machines replacing physical labor, which eliminated many traditional male occupations, and the rise of the service sector in which many jobs are gender neutral.\n\nAnother factor that may have contributed to the trend was the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], which aimed at abolishing wage disparity based on sex. Such legislation diminished sexual discrimination and encouraged more women to enter the labor market by receiving fair remuneration to help raising families and children.\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, the labor force participation began to reverse its long period of increase. Reasons for the change include a rising share of older workers, an increase in school enrollment rates among young workers, and a decrease in female labor force participation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Van Zandweghe|first=Willem|title=Interpreting the Recent Decline in Labor Force Participation|journal=KC Fed Economic Review, First Quarter, 2012|pages=5\u201334|url=http://www.kc.frb.org/publicat/econrev/pdf/12q1VanZandweghe.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe labor force participation rate can decrease when the rate of growth of the population outweighs that of the employed and the unemployed together. The labor force participation rate is a key component in long-term economic growth, almost as important as [[productivity]].\n\nA historic shift began around the end of the [[Great Recession]] as women began leaving the labor force in the United States and other developed countries.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2295236/Rise-happy-housewife-How-new-wave-feminists-giving-careers-stay-home-WANT-to.html Rise of the Happy Housewife] The Daily Mail, 18 March 2013</ref> The female labor force participation rate in the United States has steadily decreased since 2009, and as of April 2015, the female labor force participation rate has gone back down to 1988 levels of 56.6%.<ref name=\"research.stlouisfed.org\"/>\n\nParticipation rates are defined as follows:\n\n{|  style=\"margin:auto; width:90%;\"\n| Pop = total population || LF = labor force = U + E\n|-\n| LFpop = labor force population <br/> (generally defined as all men and women aged 15\u201364) || p = participation rate = LF / LFpop\n|-\n| E = number employed || e = rate of employment = E / LFpop\n|-\n| U = number of unemployed || u = rate of unemployment = U / LF\n|}\n\nThe labor force participation rate explains how an increase in the unemployment rate can occur simultaneously with an increase in employment. If a large number of new workers enter the labor force but only a small fraction become employed, then the increase in the number of unemployed workers can outpace the growth in employment.<ref>Peter Barth and Dennis Heffley [https://web.archive.org/web/20070621060113/http://www.cteconomy.uconn.edu/TCE_Individual_Articles/Spring_2004/LocalLaborForceParticipationRates.pdf \"Taking Apart Taking Part: Local Labor Force Participation Rates\"] University of Connecticut, 2004.</ref>\n\n====Unemployment ratio====\nThe unemployment ratio calculates the share of unemployed for the whole population.

In a prospective study of 9,570 individuals over four years, highly-conscientious people suffered more than twice as much if they became unemployed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Boyce|first=Christopher J.|author2=Wood, Alex M. |author3=Brown, Gordon D.A. |title=The dark side of conscientiousness: Conscientious people experience greater drops in life satisfaction following unemployment|journal=Journal of Research in Personality |year=2010 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=535\u2013539 |doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2010.05.001 }}</ref> The authors suggested that may because of conscientious people making different attributions about why they became unemployed or through experiencing stronger reactions following failure.

However, since it is difficult or impossible to get unemployment insurance benefits without having worked in the past, those jobs and unemployment are more complementary than they are substitutes. (They are often held short-term, either by students or by those trying to gain experience; turnover in most low-paying jobs is high.)\n\nAnother cost for the unemployed is that the combination of unemployment, lack of financial resources, and social responsibilities may push unemployed workers to take jobs that do not fit their skills or allow them to use their talents. Unemployment can cause [[underemployment]], and fear of job loss can spur psychological anxiety. As well as anxiety, it can cause depression, lack of confidence, and huge amounts of stress, which is increased when the unemployed are faced with health issues, poverty, and lack of relational support.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Unemployment and underemployment: A narrative analysis about loss|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236855506|journal = Journal of Vocational Behavior|pages = 256\u2013265|volume = 82|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.jvb.2013.02.005|first = David L.|last = Blustein|first2 = Saliha|last2 = Kozan|first3 = Alice|last3 = Connors-Kellgren|year = 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother personal cost of unemployment is its impact on relationships.

The fall of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1933 and [[Machtergreifung|Adolf Hitler's rise to power]], which culminated in [[World War II]] and the deaths of tens of millions and the destruction of much of the physical capital of Europe, is attributed to the poor economic conditions in Germany at the time, notably a high unemployment rate<ref name=\"leopold\">[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/les-leopold/why-are-we-afraid-to-crea_b_487041.html Why are We Afraid to Create the Jobs We Need?], Les Leopold, 5 March 2010</ref> of above 20%; see [[Great Depression in Central Europe]] for details.\n\nHowever the [[hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic]] is not directly blamed for the Nazi rise. Hyperinflation occurred primarily in 1921 to 1923, the year of Hitler's [[Beer Hall Putsch]]. Although hyperinflation has been blamed for damaging the credibility of democratic institutions, the Nazis did not assume government until 1933, ten years after the hyperinflation but in the midst of high unemployment.\n\nRising unemployment has traditionally been regarded by the public and the media in any country as a key guarantor of electoral defeat for any government that oversees it. That was very much the consensus in the United Kingdom until 1983, when Thatcher's Conservative government won a [[1983 United Kingdom general election|landslide in the general election]], despite overseeing a rise in unemployment from 1.5 million to 3.2 million since the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 election]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15276765 |work=BBC News | title=Whatever happened to full employment? | date=13 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Benefits===\n{{Main|Full employment}}\nThe primary benefit of unemployment is that people are available for hire, without being [[recruiter|headhunted]] away from their existing employers.

Employers avoid shirking by preventing wages from decreasing so low that workers give up and become unproductive. The higher wages perpetuate unemployment, but the threat of unemployment reduces shirking.\n\nBefore current levels of world trade were developed, unemployment was shown to reduce inflation, following the [[Phillips curve]], or to decelerate inflation, following the NAIRU/[[natural rate of unemployment]] theory since it is relatively easy to seek a new job without losing a current job. When more jobs are available for fewer workers (lower unemployment), that may allow workers to find the jobs that better fit their tastes, talents and needs.\n\nAs in the Marxian theory of unemployment, [[special interests]] may also benefit. Some employers may expect that employees with no fear of losing their jobs will not work as hard or will demand increased wages and benefit. According to that theory, unemployment may promote general labour [[productivity]] and [[profit (economics)|profitability]] by increasing employers' rationale for their [[monopsony]]-like power (and profits).<ref name=\"Marx 1863 478 or at MEW, 26.3, 300\">{{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Theorien \u00fcber den Mehrwert (Theory of Surplus Value)|year=1863|pages=478 or at MEW, 26.3, 300|url=http://www.mlwerke.de/me/me26/me26b471.htm}}</ref>\n\nOptimal unemployment has also been defended as an environmental tool to brake the constantly-accelerated growth of the GDP to maintain levels that are sustainable in the context of resource constraints and environmental impacts.<ref>{{Cite book\n| last = O'Sullivan\n| first = Arthur\n| authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist)\n| first2 = Steven M. | last2 = Sheffrin | authorlink2 = Steven M.

The demand for labour in an economy is derived from the demand for goods and services. As such, if the demand for goods and services in the economy increases, the demand for labour will increase, increasing employment and wages.\n\nThere are many ways to stimulate demand for goods and services. Increasing wages to the working class (those more likely to spend the increased funds on goods and services, rather than various types of savings or commodity purchases) is one theory thaf is proposed. Increased wages are believed to be more effective in boosting demand for goods and services than central banking strategies, which put the increased money supply mostly into the hands of wealthy persons and institutions. Monetarists suggest that increasing money supply in general increases short-term demand. As for the long-term demand, the increased demand is negated by inflation. A rise in fiscal expenditures is another strategy for boosting aggregate demand.\n\nProviding aid to the unemployed is a strategy that is used to prevent cutbacks in consumption of goods and services, which can lead to a vicious cycle of further job losses and further decreases in consumption and demand. Many countries aid the unemployed through social [[welfare]] programs. Such unemployment benefits include [[unemployment insurance]], [[unemployment compensation]], welfare, and subsidies to aid in retraining. The main goal of such programs is to alleviate short-term hardships and, more importantly, to allow workers more time to search for a job.\n\nA direct demand-side solution to unemployment is government-funded employment of the able-bodied poor. This was notably implemented in Britain from the 17th century until 1948 in the institution of the [[workhouse]], which provided jobs for the unemployed with harsh conditions and poor wages to dissuade their use. A modern alternative is a [[job guarantee]] in which the government guarantees work at a living wage.\n\nTemporary measures can include [[public works]] programs such as the [[Works Progress Administration]]. Government-funded employment is not widely advocated as a solution to unemployment except in times of crisis. That is attributed to the public sector jobs' existence depending directly on the tax receipts from private sector employment.\n[[File:State Employment growth and Tax Changes for the Top 10%.jpg|thumb|Supply-side economics proposes that lower taxes lead to employment growth. Historical state data from the United States shows a heterogeneous result.]]\n\nIn the US, the unemployment insurance allowance is based solely on previous income (not time worked, family size, etc.) and usually compensates for one third of previous income. To qualify, people must reside in their respective state for at least a year and work. The system was established by the [[Social Security Act]] of 1935. Although 90% of citizens are covered by unemployment insurance, less than 40% apply for and receive benefits.<ref>{{cite web|last=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|title=Introduction to Unemployment Insurance|url=http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=1466#_ftn2|accessdate=21 October 2010|date=2008-12-15}}</ref> However, the number applying for and receiving benefits increases during recessions. For highly-seasonal industries, the system provides income to workers during the off-season, thus encouraging them to stay attached to the industry.\n[[File:State Employment growth and Tax Changes for the Bottom 90% v2.jpg|thumb|Tax decreases on high income earners (top 10%) are not correlated with employment growth, but tax decreases on lower-income earners (bottom 90%) are correlated with employment growth.<ref name=\"economix.blogs.nytimes.com\">{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/tax-cuts-for-job-creators/ | work=The New York Times | title=Tax Cuts for Job Creators | date=19 October 2012}}</ref>]]\n\nAccording to classical economic theory, markets reach equilibrium where supply equals demand; everyone who wants to sell at the market price can do so. Those who do not want to sell at that price do not; in the labour market, this is classical unemployment. Monetary policy and fiscal policy can both be used to increase short-term growth in the economy, increasing the demand for labour and decreasing unemployment.\n\n===Supply-side solutions===\nHowever, the labor market is not 100% efficient although it may be more efficient than the bureaucracy. Some argue that minimum wages and union activity keep wages from falling, which means that too many people want to sell their labour at the going price but cannot. That assumes [[perfect competition]] exists in the labour market, specifically that no single entity is large enough to affect wage levels and that employees are similar in ability.\n\nAdvocates of [[supply-side]] policies believe those policies can solve the problem by making the labour market more flexible. These include removing the minimum wage and reducing the power of unions. Supply-siders argue that their reforms increase long-term growth by reducing labour costs. The increased supply of goods and services requires more workers, increasing employment. It is argued that supply-side policies, which include cutting taxes on businesses and reducing regulation, create jobs, reduce unemployment, and decrease labor's share of national income. Other supply-side policies include education to make workers more attractive to employers.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone, 02-1931 - NARA - 541927.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen in [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]], 1931]]\nThere are relatively limited historical records on unemployment because it has not always been acknowledged or measured systematically. Industrialization involves [[economies of scale]], which often prevent individuals from having the capital to create their own jobs to be self-employed. An individual who cannot join an enterprise or create a job is unemployed. As individual farmers, ranchers, spinners, doctors and merchants are organized into large enterprises, those who cannot join or compete become unemployed.\n\nRecognition of unemployment occurred slowly as economies across the world industrialized and bureaucratized. Before then, traditional [[Self-sustainability|self-sufficient]] native societies have no concept of unemployment. The recognition of the concept of \"unemployment\" is best exemplified through the well documented historical records in England. For example, in 16th-century England no distinction was made between [[vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] and the jobless; both were simply categorized as \"[[sturdy beggar]]s\", who were to be punished and moved on.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Sturdy+Beggars&offset=0 |title=Sturdy Beggars |publisher=Probertencyclopaedia.com |accessdate=22 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608180220/http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Sturdy+Beggars&offset=0 |archivedate=8 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe closing of the [[monastery|monasteries]] in the 1530s increased [[poverty]], as the [[Roman Catholic Church]] had helped the poor. In addition, there was a significant rise in [[enclosures]] during the [[Tudor period]]. Also, the population was rising. Those unable to find work had a stark choice: starve or break the law. In 1535, a bill was drawn up calling for the creation of a system of [[public works]], which were to deal with the problem of unemployment and to be funded by a tax on income and capital.

Furthermore, the [[monetary authority]] of a country, such as the [[central bank]], can influence the availability and cost for money through its [[monetary policy]].\n\nIn addition to theories of unemployment, a few categorisations of unemployment are used for more precisely [[Conceptual model|modelling]] the effects of unemployment within the economic system. Some of the main types of unemployment include [[structural unemployment]], [[frictional unemployment]], [[cyclical unemployment]], [[involuntary unemployment]] and [[classical unemployment]]. [[Unemployment types#Structural unemployment|Structural unemployment]] focuses on foundational problems in the economy and inefficiencies inherent in labor markets, including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skill sets. Structural arguments emphasize causes and solutions related to [[disruptive technology|disruptive technologies]] and [[globalization]]. Discussions of [[frictional unemployment]] focus on voluntary decisions to work based on individuals' valuation of their own work and how that compares to current wage rates added to the time and effort required to find a job. Causes and solutions for frictional unemployment often address job entry threshold and wage rates.\n\nGlobally, 172 million people globally or 5% of the reported workforce of the world were without a job in 2018, according to the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ilo.org/ilostat/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pagehierarchy/Page3.jspx?MBI_ID=2&locale=en&_afrLoop=1809645378580656&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null#!%40%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26locale%3Den%26_afrLoop%3D1809645378580656%26MBI_ID%3D2%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dsxm9jfbzq_21|title=International Labour Organization: Unemployment rate}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the difficulty to measure the unemployment rate by for example using surveys like in the [[United States]] or through registered unemployed citizens like in some countries in [[Europe]] countries, statistical figures such as the [[employment-to-population ratio]] could be better suited to evaluate the status of the [[workforce]] and the [[economy]] if they would be based on people who are registered as, for example, [[taxpayer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/crs-implementation-and-assistance/tax-identification-numbers/ |title=OECD TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS}}</ref>\n\n==Definitions, types, and theories==\nThe state of being without any work yet looking for work is called unemployment. Economists distinguish between various overlapping types of and theories of unemployment, including [[#Cyclical or Keynesian theory of unemployment|cyclical or Keynesian unemployment]], [[frictional unemployment]], [[structural unemployment]] and [[classical unemployment]]. Some additional types of unemployment that are occasionally mentioned are seasonal unemployment, hardcore unemployment, and hidden unemployment.\n\nThough there have been several definitions of \"voluntary\" and \"[[involuntary unemployment]]\" in the economics literature, a simple distinction is often applied. Voluntary unemployment is attributed to the individual's decisions, but involuntary unemployment exists because of the socio-economic environment (including the market structure, government intervention, and the level of aggregate demand) in which individuals operate. In these terms, much or most of [[frictional unemployment]] is voluntary since it reflects individual search behavior. Voluntary unemployment includes workers who reject low-wage jobs, but involuntary unemployment includes workers fired because of an economic crisis, [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]], company bankruptcy, or organizational restructuring.\n\nOn the other hand, cyclical unemployment, structural unemployment, and classical unemployment are largely involuntary in nature. However, the existence of structural unemployment may reflect choices made by the unemployed in the past, and classical (natural) unemployment may result from the legislative and economic choices made by labour unions or political parties.\n\nThe clearest cases of involuntary unemployment are those with fewer job vacancies than unemployed workers even when wages are allowed to adjust and so even if all vacancies were to be filled, some unemployed workers would still remain. That happens with cyclical unemployment, as macroeconomic forces cause microeconomic unemployment, which can boomerang back and exacerbate those macroeconomic forces.\n\n===Classical unemployment===\nClassical, or real-wage, unemployment, occurs when real wages for a job are set above the [[market-clearing]] level, causing the number of job-seekers to exceed the number of vacancies. On the other hand, most economists argue that as wages fall below a livable wage, many choose to drop out of the labor market and no longer seek employment. That is especially true in countries in which low-income families are supported through public welfare systems. In such cases, wages would have to be high enough to motivate people to choose employment over what they receive through public welfare. Wages below a livable wage are likely to result in lower labor market participation in the above-stated scenario. In addition, consumption of goods and services is the primary driver of increased [[demand for labor]]. Higher wages lead to workers having more income available to consume goods and services. Therefore, higher wages increase general consumption and as a result demand for labor increases and unemployment decreases.\n\nMany economists have argued that unemployment increases with increased governmental regulation. For example, [[minimum wage]] laws raise the cost of some low-skill laborers above market equilibrium, resulting in increased unemployment as people who wish to work at the going rate cannot (as the new and higher enforced wage is now greater than the value of their labour).<ref>{{cite book |first=F.

Some associate cyclical unemployment with frictional unemployment because the factors that cause the friction are partially caused by cyclical variables. For example, a surprise decrease in the money supply may suddenly inhibit aggregate demand and thus inhibit [[labor demand]].\n\n[[Keynesian]] economists, on the other hand, see the lack of supply of jobs as potentially resolvable by government intervention. One suggested intervention involves [[deficit spending]] to boost employment and goods demand. Another intervention involves an expansionary [[monetary policy]] to increase  the [[supply of money]], which should reduce [[interest rate]]s, which, in turn, should lead to an increase in non-governmental spending.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|first = Seymour E.\n|last=Harris\n|title=The New Economics: Keynes' Influence on Theory and Public Policy\n|year=2005\n|isbn=978-1-4191-4534-6\n|publisher= Kessinger Publishing}}\n</ref>\n\n===Full unemployment===\n{{Main|Full employment}}\n[[File:NAIRU-SR-and-LR.svg|thumb|right|Short-Run [[Phillips Curve]] before and after Expansionary Policy, with Long-Run Phillips Curve (NAIRU).

However, the economy eventually hits an \"[[inflation]] barrier\" that is imposed by the four other kinds of unemployment to the extent that they exist. Historical experience suggests that low unemployment affects inflation in the short term but not the long term.<ref name=chang>Chang, R. (1997) [https://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/ACFC7.pdf \"Is Low Unemployment Inflationary?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113212953/https://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/ACFC7.pdf |date=13 November 2013}} ''Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Economic Review'' 1Q97:4\u201313</ref> In the long term, the [[velocity of money]] supply measures such as the MZM (\"money zero maturity\", representing cash and equivalent [[demand deposit]]s) velocity is far more predictive of inflation than low unemployment.<ref name=hossfeld>Oliver Hossfeld (2010) [https://web.archive.org/web/20131113215511/http://www.hhl.de/fileadmin/texte/publikationen/forschungspapiere/HOSSFELD_USMONEY_INFERWP_2010-4.pdf \"US Money Demand, Monetary Overhang, and Inflation Prediction\"] ''International Network for Economic Research'' working paper no. 2010.4</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MZMV |title=MZM velocity |publisher=Research.stlouisfed.org |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nSome demand theory economists see the inflation barrier as corresponding to the [[natural rate of unemployment]]. The \"natural\" rate of unemployment is defined as the rate of unemployment that exists when the labour market is in equilibrium, and there is pressure for neither rising inflation rates nor falling inflation rates. An alternative technical term for that rate is the [[NAIRU]], the ''Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment''. Whatever its name, demand theory holds that if the unemployment rate gets \"too low,\" inflation will accelerate in the absence of wage and price controls (incomes policies).\n\nOne of the major problems with the NAIRU theory is that no one knows exactly what the NAIRU is, and it clearly changes over time.<ref name=chang/> The margin of error can be quite high relative to the actual unemployment rate, making it hard to use the NAIRU in policy-making.<ref name=hossfeld/>\n\nAnother, normative, definition of full employment might be called the ''ideal'' unemployment rate. It would exclude all types of unemployment that represent forms of inefficiency. This type of \"full employment\" unemployment would correspond to only frictional unemployment (excluding that part encouraging the [[McJob]]s management strategy) and so would be very low. However, it would be impossible to attain this full-employment target using only demand-side [[Keynesian]] stimulus without getting below the NAIRU and causing accelerating inflation (absent incomes policies). Training programs aimed at fighting structural unemployment would help here.\n\nTo the extent that hidden unemployment exists, it implies that official unemployment statistics provide a poor guide to what unemployment rate coincides with \"full employment.\"<ref name=chang/>\n\n===Structural unemployment===\n{{Main|Structural unemployment}}\n[[File:Okuns law quarterly differences.svg|thumb|[[Okun's Law]] interprets unemployment as a function of the rate of growth in GDP.]]\n[[Structural unemployment]] occurs when a labour market is unable to provide jobs for everyone who wants one because there is a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed workers and the skills needed for the available jobs. Structural unemployment is hard to separate empirically from frictional unemployment except that it lasts longer. As with frictional unemployment, simple demand-side stimulus will not work to abolish this type of unemployment easily.\n\nStructural unemployment may also be encouraged to rise by persistent cyclical unemployment: if an economy suffers from longlasting low aggregate demand, it means that many of the unemployed become disheartened, and their skills (including [[job hunting|job-searching]] skills) become \"rusty\" and obsolete. Problems with debt may lead to [[homelessness]] and a fall into the vicious circle of poverty.\n\nThat means that they may not fit the job vacancies that are created when the economy recovers. The implication is that sustained ''high'' demand may ''lower'' structural unemployment. This theory of persistence in structural unemployment has been referred to as an example of [[path dependence]] or \"[[hysteresis]].\"\n\nMuch ''[[technological unemployment]]'',<ref name=\"Jerome 1934\"/> caused by the replacement of workers by machines might be counted as structural unemployment. Alternatively, technological unemployment might refer to the way in which steady increases in labour productivity mean that fewer workers are needed to produce the same level of output every year. The fact that aggregate demand can be raised to deal with the problem suggests that the problem is instead one of cyclical unemployment. As indicated by [[Okun's law]], the demand side must grow sufficiently quickly to absorb not only the growing labour force but also the workers who are made redundant by the increased labour productivity.\n\nSeasonal unemployment may be seen as a kind of structural unemployment since it is linked to certain kinds of jobs (construction and migratory farm work). The most-cited official unemployment measures erase this kind of unemployment from the statistics using \"seasonal adjustment\" techniques. That results in substantial and permanent structural unemployment.\n\n===Frictional unemployment===\n{{Main|Frictional unemployment}}\n[[File:US beveridge 2004 through fall 2010.gif|thumb|The [[Beveridge curve]] of 2004 [[vacancy (economics)|job vacancy]] and unemployment rate from the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics.]]\n\nFrictional unemployment is the time period between jobs in which a worker [[search theory|searches]] for or transitions from one job to another. It is sometimes called ''search unemployment'' and can be voluntary, based on the circumstances of the unemployed individual. Frictional unemployment exists because both jobs and workers are [[heterogeneity in economics|heterogeneous]], and a mismatch can result between the characteristics of supply and demand. Such a mismatch can be related to skills, payment, work-time, location, seasonal industries, attitude, taste, and a multitude of other factors. New entrants (such as graduating students) and re-entrants (such as former homemakers) can also suffer a spell of frictional unemployment.\n\nWorkers and employers accept a certain level of imperfection, risk or compromise, but usually not right away. They will invest some time and effort to find a better match. That is, in fact, beneficial to the economy since it results in a better allocation of resources. However, if the search takes too long and mismatches are too frequent, the economy suffers since some work will not get done. Therefore, governments will seek ways to reduce unnecessary frictional unemployment by multiple means including providing education, advice, training, and assistance such as [[daycare center]]s.\n\nThe frictions in the [[labour market]] are sometimes illustrated graphically with a [[Beveridge curve]], a downward-sloping, convex curve that shows a correlation between the unemployment rate on one axis and the vacancy rate on the other. Changes in the supply of or demand for labour cause movements along the curve. An increase or decrease in labour market frictions will shift the curve outwards or inwards.\n\n===Hidden unemployment===\nOfficial statistics often underestimate unemployment rates because of hidden, or covered, unemployment. That is the unemployment of potential workers that are not reflected in official unemployment statistics because of how the statistics are collected. In many countries, only those who have no work but are actively looking for work and/or qualifying for social security benefits are counted as unemployed. Those who have given up looking for work and sometimes those who are on government \"retraining\" programs are not officially counted among the unemployed even though they are not employed. \n\nHidden unemployment often is caused by the state's deliberate manipulations to make statistics about the country look better especially for international propaganda purposes, as wad a common practice in the Soviet Union and its satellite states under the Warsaw Pact. Especially in those countries, it is often referred to as agrarian unemployment since it often occurred in agricultural sectors, mostly in rural areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://forsal.pl/finansopedia/inne/hasla/912046,bezrobocie-ukryte.html|title=Bezrobocie ukryte - Encyklopedia Gazety Prawnej|website=forsal.pl|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref> It was commonly done in a form of early retirement because of lack of vacant jobs for those who had not reached the retirement age or often a situation in which increasing the number of employees did not increase the production (creating fake vacancies on paper for people with whom they did not know what to do, how to use their potential workforce but not admitting to that inability and paying out the diminutive wages for them to pretend to work and remain silent), thus rendering the overall productivity close to zero. It was a very common problem and one of the main reasons for the economic crisis leading to the common people's strikes that later on led to governments responding with martial law state in places like Poland, and the eventual downfall of USSR and Soviet occupation over the rest of the subjugated states under the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe statistic also does not count the \"[[underemployment|underemployed]],\" yhose working fewer hours than they would prefer or in a job that fails to make good use of their capabilities. In addition, those who are of working age but are currently in full-time education are usually not considered unemployed in government statistics. Traditional unemployed native societies who survive by gathering, hunting, herding, and farming in wilderness areas may or may not be counted in unemployment statistics.\n\n===Long-term unemployment===\n'''Long-term unemployment''' (LTU) is defined in [[European Union]] statistics as unemployment lasting for longer than one year (while unemployment lasting over two years is defined as ''very long-term unemployment''). The United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS), which reports current long-term unemployment rate at 1.9 percent, defines this as unemployment lasting 27 weeks or longer. Long-term unemployment is a component of [[structural unemployment]], which results in long-term unemployment existing in every social group, industry, occupation, and all levels of education.<ref>{{Citation |last=Bivens |first= Josh |last2=Shierholz |first2=Heidi |title=Lagging Demand, Not Unemployability, Is Why Long-term Unemployment Remains So High |publisher=Economic Policy Institute |url=http://www.epi.org/publication/lagging-demand-is-behind-high-long-term-unemployment/}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 the European Commission published recommendations on how to reduce long-term unemployment.<ref>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016H0220%2801%29&qid=1456753373365</ref> These advised governments to:\n\n* encourage long-term unemployed people to '''register''' with an [[Public employment service|employment service]];\n* provide each registered long-term unemployed person with an '''individual in-depth assessment''' to identify their needs and potential within 18 months;\n* offer a tailor-made '''job integration agreement''' (JIA) to all registered long-term unemployed within 18 months. These might include measures such as [[Mentorship|mentoring]], help with [[Job hunting|job search]], [[further education]] and training, support for housing, transport, child and care services and rehabilitation. Each person would have a single point of contact to access this support, which would be implemented in partnership with employers.\n\nIn 2017\u20132019 it implemented the Long-Term Unemployment project to research solutions implemented by EU member states and produce a toolkit<ref>https://ec.europa.eu/esf/transnationality/ltu-project</ref> to guide government action.

According to [[Karl Marx]], unemployment is inherent within the unstable capitalist system and periodic crises of mass unemployment are to be expected.

At first glance, unemployment seems inefficient since unemployed workers do not increase profits, but unemployment is profitable within the global capitalist system because unemployment lowers wages which are costs from the perspective of the owners. From this perspective low wages benefit the system by reducing [[economic rent]]s. Yet, it does not benefit workers; according to Karl Marx, the workers (proletariat) work to benefit the bourgeoisie through their production of capital.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm | title=Communist Manifesto (Chapter 1)}}</ref> Capitalist systems unfairly manipulate the market for labour by perpetuating unemployment which lowers laborers' demands for fair wages. Workers are pitted against one another at the service of increasing profits for owners.

The use of this method has been declining in favor of labour surveys.\n* ''Social Insurance Statistics'', such as unemployment benefits, are computed base on the number of persons insured representing the total labour force and the number of persons who are insured that are collecting benefits.

People who do not seek work may choose to declare themselves unemployed to get benefits; people with undeclared paid occupations may try to get unemployment benefits in addition to the money that they earn from their work.<ref name=\"Reporting benefit fraud.\">{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/BenefitsTaxCreditsAndOtherSupport/BenefitFraud/DG_10014876 |title=Reporting benefit fraud |publisher=Directgov |accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Japan, and the European Union, unemployment is measured using a sample survey (akin to a [[Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll).<ref name=\"ilo.org\"/> According to the BLS, a number of Eastern European nations have instituted labour force surveys as well. The sample survey has its own problems because the total number of workers in the economy is calculated based on a sample, rather than a census.\n\nIt is possible to be neither employed nor unemployed by ILO definitions by being outside of the \"labour force.\"<ref name=\"sfgate.com\"/> Such people have no job and are not looking for one. Many of them go to school or are retired. Family responsibilities keep others out of the labour force. Still others have a physical or mental disability that prevents them from participating in the labour force. Some people simply elect not to work and prefer to be dependent on others for sustenance.\n\nTypically, employment and the labour force include only work that is done for monetary gain. Hence, a [[homemaker]] is neither part of the labour force nor unemployed. Also, full-time students and prisoners are considered to be neither part of the labour force nor unemployed.<ref name=\"Krueger 1999\"/> The number of prisoners can be important. In 1999, economists Lawrence F. Katz and Alan B. Krueger estimated that increased incarceration lowered measured unemployment in the United States by 0.17% between 1985 and the late 1990s.<ref name=\"Krueger 1999\"/>\n\nIn particular, as of 2005, roughly 0.7% of the US population is incarcerated (1.5% of the available working population). Additionally, children, the elderly, and some individuals with disabilities are typically not counted as part of the labour force and so are not included in the unemployment statistics. However, some elderly and many disabled individuals are active in the labour market.\n\nIn the early stages of an [[boom and bust|economic boom]], unemployment often rises.<ref name=\"Keynes 2007\"/> That is because people join the labour market (give up studying, start a job hunt, etc.) as a result of the improving job market, but until they have actually found a position, they are counted as unemployed. Similarly, during a [[recession]], the increase in the unemployment rate is moderated by people leaving the labour force or being otherwise discounted from the labour force, such as with the self-employed.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2004, according to [[OECD]] ([http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/36/30/35024561.pdf Employment Outlook 2005] {{ISBN|92-64-01045-9}}), normalized unemployment for men aged 25 to 54 was 4.6% in the US and 7.4% in France. At the same time and for the same population, the employment rate (number of workers divided by population) was 86.3% in the US and 86.7% in France. That example shows that the unemployment rate was 60% higher in France than in the US, but more people in that demographic were working in France than in the US, which is counterintuitive if it is expected that the unemployment rate reflects the health of the labour market.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Dean|url=http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=01&year=2007&base_name=wall_street_journal_gets_germa&162#comment-1679545|title=Wall Street Journal Gets German Unemployment Wrong|work=The American Prospect|access-date=1 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033323/http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=01&year=2007&base_name=wall_street_journal_gets_germa&162#comment-1679545|archive-date=30 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Raymond Torres, OECD head of Employment Analysis, [http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-823448,36-917229@51-628862,0.html Avec 1,2 % de baisse fin avril, le taux de ch\u00f4mage continue sa d\u00e9crue]{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Le Monde'', 30 mai 2007 : ''unemployment measure is less and less meaningful to measure labour market efficiency.''</ref>\n\nThose deficiencies make many [[labour economics|labour market]] economists prefer to look at a range of economic statistics such as labour market participation rate, the percentage of people between 15 and 64 who are currently employed or searching for employment, the total number of full-time jobs in an economy, the number of people seeking work as a raw number and not a percentage, and the total number of person-hours worked in a month compared to the total number of person-hours people would like to work.

Men are represented in light blue, women in pink, and the total in black.]]\nThe labor force participation rate is the ratio between the [[labor force]] and the overall size of their [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] (national population of the same age range). In the West, during the later half of the 20th century, the labor force participation rate increased significantly because of an increase in the number of women entering the workplace.\n\nIn the United States, there have been four significant stages of women's participation in the labour force: increases in the 20th century and decreases in the 21st century. Male labor force participation decreased from 1953 to 2013. Since October 2013, men have been increasingly joining the labour force.\n\nFrom the late 19th century to the 1920s, very few women worked outside the home. They were young single women who typically withdrew from the labor force at marriage unless family needed two incomes. Such women worked primarily in the [[textile manufacturing]] industry or as [[domestic worker]]s. That profession empowered women and allowed them to earn a living wage. At times, they were a financial help to their families.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1950, female labor force participation increased primarily because of the increased demand for office workers, women's participation in the high school movement, and [[electrification]], which reduced the time that was spent on household chores. Between the 1950s to the early 1970s, most women were secondary earners working mainly as secretaries, teachers, nurses, and librarians ([[pink-collar]] jobs).\n\nFrom the mid-1970s to the late 1990s, there was a period of revolution of women in the labor force brought on by various factors, many of which arose from the [[second-wave feminism]] movement. Women more accurately planned for their future in the work force by investing in more applicable majors in college that prepared them to enter and compete in the labor market. In the United States, the female labor force participation rate rose from approximately 33% in 1948 to a peak of 60.3% in 2000. As of April 2015, the female labor force participation is at 56.6%, the male labor force participation rate is at 69.4%, and the total is 62.8%.<ref name=\"research.stlouisfed.org\">[https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LNS11300002 Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate: Women] Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</ref>\n\nA common theory in modern economics claims that the rise of women participating in the US labor force in the 1950s to the 1990s was caused by the introduction of a new contraceptive technology, [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pills]], as well as the adjustment of [[age of majority]] laws. The use of birth control gave women the flexibility of opting to invest and to advance their career while they maintained a relationship. By having control over the timing of their fertility, they were not running a risk of thwarting their career choices. However, only 40% of the population actually used the birth control pill.\n\nThat implies that other factors may have contributed to women choosing to invest in advancing their careers. One factor may be that more and more men delayed the age of marriage, which allowef women to marry later in life without them worrying about the quality of older men. Other factors include the changing nature of work, with machines replacing physical labor, which eliminated many traditional male occupations, and the rise of the service sector in which many jobs are gender neutral.\n\nAnother factor that may have contributed to the trend was the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], which aimed at abolishing wage disparity based on sex. Such legislation diminished sexual discrimination and encouraged more women to enter the labor market by receiving fair remuneration to help raising families and children.\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, the labor force participation began to reverse its long period of increase. Reasons for the change include a rising share of older workers, an increase in school enrollment rates among young workers, and a decrease in female labor force participation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Van Zandweghe|first=Willem|title=Interpreting the Recent Decline in Labor Force Participation|journal=KC Fed Economic Review, First Quarter, 2012|pages=5\u201334|url=http://www.kc.frb.org/publicat/econrev/pdf/12q1VanZandweghe.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe labor force participation rate can decrease when the rate of growth of the population outweighs that of the employed and the unemployed together. The labor force participation rate is a key component in long-term economic growth, almost as important as [[productivity]].\n\nA historic shift began around the end of the [[Great Recession]] as women began leaving the labor force in the United States and other developed countries.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2295236/Rise-happy-housewife-How-new-wave-feminists-giving-careers-stay-home-WANT-to.html Rise of the Happy Housewife] The Daily Mail, 18 March 2013</ref> The female labor force participation rate in the United States has steadily decreased since 2009, and as of April 2015, the female labor force participation rate has gone back down to 1988 levels of 56.6%.<ref name=\"research.stlouisfed.org\"/>\n\nParticipation rates are defined as follows:\n\n{|  style=\"margin:auto; width:90%;\"\n| Pop = total population || LF = labor force = U + E\n|-\n| LFpop = labor force population <br/> (generally defined as all men and women aged 15\u201364) || p = participation rate = LF / LFpop\n|-\n| E = number employed || e = rate of employment = E / LFpop\n|-\n| U = number of unemployed || u = rate of unemployment = U / LF\n|}\n\nThe labor force participation rate explains how an increase in the unemployment rate can occur simultaneously with an increase in employment. If a large number of new workers enter the labor force but only a small fraction become employed, then the increase in the number of unemployed workers can outpace the growth in employment.<ref>Peter Barth and Dennis Heffley [https://web.archive.org/web/20070621060113/http://www.cteconomy.uconn.edu/TCE_Individual_Articles/Spring_2004/LocalLaborForceParticipationRates.pdf \"Taking Apart Taking Part: Local Labor Force Participation Rates\"] University of Connecticut, 2004.</ref>\n\n====Unemployment ratio====\nThe unemployment ratio calculates the share of unemployed for the whole population.

However, since it is difficult or impossible to get unemployment insurance benefits without having worked in the past, those jobs and unemployment are more complementary than they are substitutes. (They are often held short-term, either by students or by those trying to gain experience; turnover in most low-paying jobs is high.)\n\nAnother cost for the unemployed is that the combination of unemployment, lack of financial resources, and social responsibilities may push unemployed workers to take jobs that do not fit their skills or allow them to use their talents. Unemployment can cause [[underemployment]], and fear of job loss can spur psychological anxiety. As well as anxiety, it can cause depression, lack of confidence, and huge amounts of stress, which is increased when the unemployed are faced with health issues, poverty, and lack of relational support.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Unemployment and underemployment: A narrative analysis about loss|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236855506|journal = Journal of Vocational Behavior|pages = 256\u2013265|volume = 82|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.jvb.2013.02.005|first = David L.|last = Blustein|first2 = Saliha|last2 = Kozan|first3 = Alice|last3 = Connors-Kellgren|year = 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother personal cost of unemployment is its impact on relationships.

Employers avoid shirking by preventing wages from decreasing so low that workers give up and become unproductive. The higher wages perpetuate unemployment, but the threat of unemployment reduces shirking.\n\nBefore current levels of world trade were developed, unemployment was shown to reduce inflation, following the [[Phillips curve]], or to decelerate inflation, following the NAIRU/[[natural rate of unemployment]] theory since it is relatively easy to seek a new job without losing a current job. When more jobs are available for fewer workers (lower unemployment), that may allow workers to find the jobs that better fit their tastes, talents and needs.\n\nAs in the Marxian theory of unemployment, [[special interests]] may also benefit. Some employers may expect that employees with no fear of losing their jobs will not work as hard or will demand increased wages and benefit. According to that theory, unemployment may promote general labour [[productivity]] and [[profit (economics)|profitability]] by increasing employers' rationale for their [[monopsony]]-like power (and profits).<ref name=\"Marx 1863 478 or at MEW, 26.3, 300\">{{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Theorien \u00fcber den Mehrwert (Theory of Surplus Value)|year=1863|pages=478 or at MEW, 26.3, 300|url=http://www.mlwerke.de/me/me26/me26b471.htm}}</ref>\n\nOptimal unemployment has also been defended as an environmental tool to brake the constantly-accelerated growth of the GDP to maintain levels that are sustainable in the context of resource constraints and environmental impacts.<ref>{{Cite book\n| last = O'Sullivan\n| first = Arthur\n| authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist)\n| first2 = Steven M. | last2 = Sheffrin | authorlink2 = Steven M.

The demand for labour in an economy is derived from the demand for goods and services. As such, if the demand for goods and services in the economy increases, the demand for labour will increase, increasing employment and wages.\n\nThere are many ways to stimulate demand for goods and services. Increasing wages to the working class (those more likely to spend the increased funds on goods and services, rather than various types of savings or commodity purchases) is one theory thaf is proposed. Increased wages are believed to be more effective in boosting demand for goods and services than central banking strategies, which put the increased money supply mostly into the hands of wealthy persons and institutions. Monetarists suggest that increasing money supply in general increases short-term demand. As for the long-term demand, the increased demand is negated by inflation. A rise in fiscal expenditures is another strategy for boosting aggregate demand.\n\nProviding aid to the unemployed is a strategy that is used to prevent cutbacks in consumption of goods and services, which can lead to a vicious cycle of further job losses and further decreases in consumption and demand. Many countries aid the unemployed through social [[welfare]] programs. Such unemployment benefits include [[unemployment insurance]], [[unemployment compensation]], welfare, and subsidies to aid in retraining. The main goal of such programs is to alleviate short-term hardships and, more importantly, to allow workers more time to search for a job.\n\nA direct demand-side solution to unemployment is government-funded employment of the able-bodied poor. This was notably implemented in Britain from the 17th century until 1948 in the institution of the [[workhouse]], which provided jobs for the unemployed with harsh conditions and poor wages to dissuade their use. A modern alternative is a [[job guarantee]] in which the government guarantees work at a living wage.\n\nTemporary measures can include [[public works]] programs such as the [[Works Progress Administration]]. Government-funded employment is not widely advocated as a solution to unemployment except in times of crisis. That is attributed to the public sector jobs' existence depending directly on the tax receipts from private sector employment.\n[[File:State Employment growth and Tax Changes for the Top 10%.jpg|thumb|Supply-side economics proposes that lower taxes lead to employment growth. Historical state data from the United States shows a heterogeneous result.]]\n\nIn the US, the unemployment insurance allowance is based solely on previous income (not time worked, family size, etc.) and usually compensates for one third of previous income. To qualify, people must reside in their respective state for at least a year and work. The system was established by the [[Social Security Act]] of 1935. Although 90% of citizens are covered by unemployment insurance, less than 40% apply for and receive benefits.<ref>{{cite web|last=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|title=Introduction to Unemployment Insurance|url=http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=1466#_ftn2|accessdate=21 October 2010|date=2008-12-15}}</ref> However, the number applying for and receiving benefits increases during recessions. For highly-seasonal industries, the system provides income to workers during the off-season, thus encouraging them to stay attached to the industry.\n[[File:State Employment growth and Tax Changes for the Bottom 90% v2.jpg|thumb|Tax decreases on high income earners (top 10%) are not correlated with employment growth, but tax decreases on lower-income earners (bottom 90%) are correlated with employment growth.<ref name=\"economix.blogs.nytimes.com\">{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/tax-cuts-for-job-creators/ | work=The New York Times | title=Tax Cuts for Job Creators | date=19 October 2012}}</ref>]]\n\nAccording to classical economic theory, markets reach equilibrium where supply equals demand; everyone who wants to sell at the market price can do so. Those who do not want to sell at that price do not; in the labour market, this is classical unemployment. Monetary policy and fiscal policy can both be used to increase short-term growth in the economy, increasing the demand for labour and decreasing unemployment.\n\n===Supply-side solutions===\nHowever, the labor market is not 100% efficient although it may be more efficient than the bureaucracy. Some argue that minimum wages and union activity keep wages from falling, which means that too many people want to sell their labour at the going price but cannot. That assumes [[perfect competition]] exists in the labour market, specifically that no single entity is large enough to affect wage levels and that employees are similar in ability.\n\nAdvocates of [[supply-side]] policies believe those policies can solve the problem by making the labour market more flexible. These include removing the minimum wage and reducing the power of unions. Supply-siders argue that their reforms increase long-term growth by reducing labour costs. The increased supply of goods and services requires more workers, increasing employment. It is argued that supply-side policies, which include cutting taxes on businesses and reducing regulation, create jobs, reduce unemployment, and decrease labor's share of national income. Other supply-side policies include education to make workers more attractive to employers.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone, 02-1931 - NARA - 541927.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen in [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]], 1931]]\nThere are relatively limited historical records on unemployment because it has not always been acknowledged or measured systematically. Industrialization involves [[economies of scale]], which often prevent individuals from having the capital to create their own jobs to be self-employed. An individual who cannot join an enterprise or create a job is unemployed. As individual farmers, ranchers, spinners, doctors and merchants are organized into large enterprises, those who cannot join or compete become unemployed.\n\nRecognition of unemployment occurred slowly as economies across the world industrialized and bureaucratized. Before then, traditional [[Self-sustainability|self-sufficient]] native societies have no concept of unemployment. The recognition of the concept of \"unemployment\" is best exemplified through the well documented historical records in England. For example, in 16th-century England no distinction was made between [[vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] and the jobless; both were simply categorized as \"[[sturdy beggar]]s\", who were to be punished and moved on.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Sturdy+Beggars&offset=0 |title=Sturdy Beggars |publisher=Probertencyclopaedia.com |accessdate=22 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608180220/http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Sturdy+Beggars&offset=0 |archivedate=8 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe closing of the [[monastery|monasteries]] in the 1530s increased [[poverty]], as the [[Roman Catholic Church]] had helped the poor.

[[David Ames Wells]] also noted that living conditions in England had improved near the end of the 19th century and that unemployment was low.\n\nThe scarcity and the high price of labor in the US in the 19th century was well documented by contemporary accounts, as in the following:\n\n<blockquote>\"The laboring classes are comparatively few in number, but this is counterbalanced by, and indeed, may be one of the causes of the eagerness by which they call in the use of machinery in almost every department of industry. Wherever it can be applied as a substitute for manual labor, it is universally and willingly resorted to....

Hundreds of thousands of immigrants annually came to the US and found jobs digging canals and building railroads. Almost all work during most of the 19th century was done by hand or with horses, mules, or oxen since there was very little mechanization. The workweek during most of the 19th century was 60 hours. Unemployment at times was between one and two percent.\n\nThe tight labor market was a factor in productivity gains by allowing workers to maintain or to increase their nominal wages during the secular deflation that caused real wages to rise at various times in the 19th century, especially in its final decades.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Recent Economic Changes and Their Effect on Production and Distribution of Wealth and Well-Being of Society\n|last=Wells\n|first=David A.\n|year=1891 |publisher= D.
