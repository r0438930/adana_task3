She loves to sing and dance. She tells Mehnga that she wanted to fall in love and marry, but instead married as per her family's wishes. She asks him to pretend that they are strangers so that she can fulfill her fantasy now. Mehnga agrees even though he is clueless as to how to woo a girl. They play this game and happily live their life.\n\nLaachi gets a chance to sing a song and make some money. Due to financial difficulties, she ends up singing and dancing with family's approval.  During that time, a famous singer Ajitpal Singh sees Laachi and signs her up with him. His management company gets Laachi and Mehnga to sign a document that they are single so that Laachi-Ajitpal duo can become more famous. Laachi is star-struck by Ajitpal and agrees with whatever he suggests. Ajitpal is infatuated with Laachi and tries to separate husband-wife by creating distance between them. Mehnga leaves Laachi and comes back to his village due to some misunderstandings.
