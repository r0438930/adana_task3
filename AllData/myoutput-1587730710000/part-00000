In particular, he burned almost all the Mayan manuscripts ([[Maya codices|codices]]) that would have been very useful in deciphering [[Maya script|Mayan script]], knowledge of Maya religion and civilization, and the history of the American continent.\n\n==Conversion of Maya==\nBorn in [[Cifuentes, Guadalajara|Cifuentes]], [[Guadalajara, Spain]], he became a Franciscan friar in 1541, and was sent as one of the first Franciscans to the Yucat\u00e1n, arriving in 1549. Landa was in charge of bringing the [[Roman Catholic]] faith to the [[Maya peoples]] after the [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n]]. He presided over a spiritual monopoly granted to the Catholic [[Franciscan order]] by the Spanish crown, and he worked diligently to buttress the order's power and convert the indigenous Maya. His initial appointment was to the mission of San Antonio in [[Izamal]], which served also as his primary residence while in Yucat\u00e1n.\n\nHe is the author of the ''[[Relaci\u00f3n de las cosas de Yucat\u00e1n]]'' in which he catalogues the [[Maya religion]], [[Maya language]], culture and writing system. The manuscript was written around 1566 on his return to Spain; however, the original copies have long since been lost. The account is known only as an abridgement, which in turn had undergone several iterations by various copyists. The extant version was produced around 1660, lost to scholarship for over two centuries and not rediscovered until the 19th century. In 1862, French cleric [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]] published the manuscript in a bilingual French-Spanish edition, ''Relation des choses de Yucat\u00e1n de Diego de Landa''.\n\n==Inquisition==\n\n===Suppression of Maya and destruction of Mayan texts===\nAfter hearing of [[Roman Catholic]] Maya who continued to practice [[idolatry|idol worship]], Landa ordered an [[Inquisition]] in [[Man\u00ed, Yucat\u00e1n|Mani]], ending with a ceremony called ''[[auto de f\u00e9]]''. During the ceremony on July 12, 1562, a disputed number of Maya [[codex|codices]] (according to Landa, 27 books) and approximately 5000 Maya [[cult image]]s were burned. \nOnly three pre-Columbian books of [[Maya hieroglyphics]] (also known as a [[codex]]) and, perhaps, fragments of a fourth are known to have survived. Collectively, the works are known as the [[Maya codices]].\n\nLanda's Inquisition showered a level of physical abuse upon the indigenous Maya that many viewed as excessive and was, at the very least, unusual. Scores of Maya nobles were jailed pending interrogation, and large numbers of Maya nobles and commoners were subjected to examination under \"[[Strappado|hoisting]].\"<ref>Clendinnen, Inga. ''Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatan, 1517-1570'', 2nd. ed. Cambridge: University Press, 1987</ref> During hoisting, a victim's hands were bound and looped over an extended line that was then raised until the victim's entire body was suspended in the air. Often, stone weights were added to the ankles or lashes applied to the back during interrogation.\n\nSome contemporary observers were troubled by this widespread use of torture. Crown fiat had earlier exempted indigenous peoples from the authority of the Inquisition, on the grounds that their understanding of Christianity was \"too childish\"{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} for them to be held culpable for heresies. Additionally, Landa dispensed with much of the extensive formal procedure and documentation that accompanied Spanish torture and interrogation.\n\n===Justifications===\nScholars have argued that Mexican inquisitions showed little concern to eradicate magic or convict individuals for heterodox beliefs<ref>{{Citation |last=Behar |first=Ruth |title=Sex and Sin, Witchcraft and the Devil in Late-Colonial Mexico |journal=American Ethnologist |volume=14 |year=1987 |pages=34\u201354 |doi=10.1525/ae.1987.14.1.02a00030|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/136539/1/ae.1987.14.1.02a00030.pdf }}.</ref> and that witchcraft was treated more as a religious problem capable of being resolved by confession and absolution.

In references to the books, Landa said: \n<blockquote>We found a large number of books in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen as superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which they (the Maya) regretted to an amazing degree, and which caused them much affliction.<ref name=\"Clendinnen, 70\">Clendinnen, 70</ref></blockquote>\n\nLanda's insistence of widespread cults throughout the Yucat\u00e1n is backed by ample evidence. Rituals the Spanish conquerors could not understand were labeled as idolatry, superstition, or even devil worship. One such ritual involved clay idols that were used in a strange combination of Catholicism and indigenous religion.<ref name=\"Clendinnen, 70\"/> During the ceremonies, individuals would be crucified and then have their hearts removed from their chest and their blood smeared onto the idols. Such ceremonies were practiced throughout the Yucat\u00e1n up to 45 years after the arrival of the Spaniards.\n\nLanda always believed in his inquisition.

His actions were strongly condemned before the Council of the Indies. That resulted in a \"committee of doctors\" being commissioned to investigate Landa's alleged crimes. In 1569, the committee absolved Landa of his crimes. Bishop Toral died in Mexico in 1571, allowing King [[Philip II of Spain]] to appoint Landa as the second  bishop of Yucat\u00e1n.\n\n==Landa and contemporary Mayanist studies==\n[[Image:De Landa alphabet.jpg|thumb|250px|Image of the page from ''Relaci\u00f3n de las Cosas de Yucat\u00e1n'' in which Landa describes his Maya alphabet, which was to prove instrumental in the mid-20th-century breakthrough in [[Maya hieroglyphics]] decipherment.]]Landa's ''[[Relaci\u00f3n de las cosas de Yucat\u00e1n]]'' also created a valuable record of the Mayan [[writing system]], which, despite its inaccuracies, was later to prove instrumental in the [[decipherment]] of the writing system. Landa asked his informants (his primary sources were two Maya individuals descended from a ruling Maya dynasty who were literate in the script) to write down the [[glyph]]ic symbols corresponding to each of the letters of the (Spanish) alphabet, in the belief that there ought to be a one-to-one correspondence between them. The results were faithfully reproduced by Landa in his later account, but he recognised that the set contained apparent inconsistencies and duplicates that he was unable to explain. Later researchers reviewing this material also formed the view that the \"[[de Landa alphabet]]\" was inaccurate or fanciful, and many subsequent attempts to use the transcription remained unconvincing. It was not until much later, in the mid-20th century, when it was realized and then confirmed that it was not a transcription of an ''[[alphabet]]'', as Landa and others had originally supposed, but was rather a [[syllabary]]. That was confirmed only by the work of [[Soviet]] linguist [[Yuri Knorozov]] in the 1950s and the succeeding generation of [[Mayanist]]s.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book\n| title=Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatan, 1517-1570\n| url=https://archive.org/details/ambivalentconque00inga\n| url-access=registration\n| first=Inga\n| last=Clendinnen\n| authorlink=Inga Clendinnen\n| edition=2\n| year=2003\n| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]\n| isbn=9780521527316}}\n\n* {{cite book\n| title=An interpretation of Bishop Diego de Landa's Maya alphabet.\n| first=Marshall E.\n| last=Durbin\n| year=1969\n| publisher=Middle American Research Institute, [[Tulane University]]\n| location=New Orleans\n| OCLC=1136497}}\n\n* {{cite book\n| title=Yucatan Before and After the Conquest\n| authors=Diego de Landa, William Gates\n| publisher=[[Dover Publications]]\n| url=https://www.globalgreyebooks.com/content/books/ebooks/yucatan-before-and-after-the-conquest.pdf\n| isbn=9780486236223}}\n\n* [[Relaci\u00f3n de las cosas de Yucat\u00e1n]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://users.skynet.be/fa039055/lifedeat.htm Skynet.be: A biography of Diego de Landa]\n* [http://www.mesoweb.com/bearc/cmr/19.html Mesoweb.com: Research Reports on Ancient Maya Writing] \u2014 ''Glyph Drawings from Landa's Relaci\u00f3n: A Caveat to the Investigator by George Stuart, Center for Maya Research''.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Landa Calderon, Diego de}}\n[[Category:Franciscan bishops]]\n[[Category:Historians of Mesoamerica]]\n[[Category:Mayanists]]\n[[Category:Mexican Franciscans]]\n[[Category:Novohispanic Mesoamericanists]]\n[[Category:1524 births]]\n[[Category:1579 deaths]]\n[[Category:16th-century historians]]\n[[Category:16th-century Mesoamericanists]]\n[[Category:16th-century Mexican people]]\n[[Category:16th-century Roman Catholic bishops]]\n[[Category:Colonial Mexico]]\n[[Category:Book burnings]]\n[[Category:16th century in the Maya civilization]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Christian leader\n| type        = \n| honorific-prefix = Most Reverend\n| name        = Diego de Landa\n| title       = Bishop of Yucat\u00e1n\n| image       = Diego de Landa.jpg\n| alt         = \n| caption     = \n| church      = [[Catholic Church]]\n| archdiocese = \n| diocese     = [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Yucat\u00e1n|Diocese of Yucat\u00e1n]] \n| see         = \n| term        = \n| predecessor = [[Francisco de Toral]]\n| successor   = [[Gregorio de Montalvo Olivera]]\n<!--   Orders   -->\n| ordination     = \n| ordained_by    = \n| consecration   = 1573\n| consecrated_by = [[Crist\u00f3bal Rojas Sandoval]]\n| rank           = \n<!--   Personal details   -->\n| birth_date    = November 12, 1524\n| birth_place   = [[Cifuentes, Guadalajara|Cifuentes]], [[Alcarria]], [[Spain]]\n| death_date    = April 29, 1579\n| death_place   = Yucat\u00e1n\n| previous_post = \n| nationality   = Spanish\n}}\n'''Diego de Landa Calder\u00f3n, [[Order of Friars Minor|O.F.M.]]''' (12 November 1524 &ndash; 29 April 1579) was  a Spanish [[bishop]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Yucat\u00e1n]].<ref name=CathHierDiegoLanda>{{cite web|last=Cheney |first=David M.|title=Bishop Diego de Landa, O.F.M.|website=[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bdelanda.html|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}[[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published sources|{{sup|''self-published''}}]]</ref> Many historians criticize his campaign against [[idolatry]].

His actions were strongly condemned before the Council of the Indies. That resulted in a \"committee of doctors\" being commissioned to investigate Landa's alleged crimes. In 1569, the committee absolved Landa of his crimes. Bishop Toral died in Mexico in 1571, allowing King [[Philip II of Spain]] to appoint Landa as the second  bishop of Yucat\u00e1n.\n\n==Landa and contemporary Mayanist studies==\n[[Image:De Landa alphabet.jpg|thumb|250px|Image of the page from ''Relaci\u00f3n de las Cosas de Yucat\u00e1n'' in which Landa describes his Maya alphabet, which was to prove instrumental in the mid-20th-century breakthrough in [[Maya hieroglyphics]] decipherment.]]Landa's ''[[Relaci\u00f3n de las cosas de Yucat\u00e1n]]'' also created a valuable record of the Mayan [[writing system]], which, despite its inaccuracies, was later to prove instrumental in the [[decipherment]] of the writing system. Landa asked his informants (his primary sources were two Maya individuals descended from a ruling Maya dynasty who were literate in the script) to write down the [[glyph]]ic symbols corresponding to each of the letters of the (Spanish) alphabet, in the belief that there ought to be a one-to-one correspondence between them. The results were faithfully reproduced by Landa in his later account, but he recognised that the set contained apparent inconsistencies and duplicates that he was unable to explain. Later researchers reviewing this material also formed the view that the \"[[de Landa alphabet]]\" was inaccurate or fanciful, and many subsequent attempts to use the transcription remained unconvincing. It was not until much later, in the mid-20th century, when it was realized and then confirmed that it was not a transcription of an ''[[alphabet]]'', as Landa and others had originally supposed, but was rather a [[syllabary]]. That was confirmed only by the work of [[Soviet]] linguist [[Yuri Knorozov]] in the 1950s and the succeeding generation of [[Mayanist]]s.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book\n| title=Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatan, 1517-1570\n| url=https://archive.org/details/ambivalentconque00inga\n| url-access=registration\n| first=Inga\n| last=Clendinnen\n| authorlink=Inga Clendinnen\n| edition=2\n| year=2003\n| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]\n| isbn=9780521527316}}\n\n* {{cite book\n| title=An interpretation of Bishop Diego de Landa's Maya alphabet.\n| first=Marshall E.\n| last=Durbin\n| year=1969\n| publisher=Middle American Research Institute, [[Tulane University]]\n| location=New Orleans\n| OCLC=1136497}}\n\n* {{cite book\n| title=Yucatan Before and After the Conquest\n| authors=Diego de Landa, William Gates\n| publisher=[[Dover Publications]]\n| url=https://www.globalgreyebooks.com/content/books/ebooks/yucatan-before-and-after-the-conquest.pdf\n| isbn=9780486236223}}\n\n* [[Relaci\u00f3n de las cosas de Yucat\u00e1n]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://users.skynet.be/fa039055/lifedeat.htm Skynet.be: A biography of Diego de Landa]\n* [http://www.mesoweb.com/bearc/cmr/19.html Mesoweb.com: Research Reports on Ancient Maya Writing] \u2014 ''Glyph Drawings from Landa's Relaci\u00f3n: A Caveat to the Investigator by George Stuart, Center for Maya Research''.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Landa Calderon, Diego de}}\n[[Category:Franciscan bishops]]\n[[Category:Historians of Mesoamerica]]\n[[Category:Mayanists]]\n[[Category:Mexican Franciscans]]\n[[Category:Novohispanic Mesoamericanists]]\n[[Category:1524 births]]\n[[Category:1579 deaths]]\n[[Category:16th-century historians]]\n[[Category:16th-century Mesoamericanists]]\n[[Category:16th-century Mexican people]]\n[[Category:16th-century Roman Catholic bishops]]\n[[Category:Colonial Mexico]]\n[[Category:Book burnings]]\n[[Category:16th century in the Maya civilization]]\n", "name_user": "WhinyTheYounger", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_de_Landa"}
