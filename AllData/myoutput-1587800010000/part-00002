This was the longest uprising in the history of the Gulag. According to Soviet archives, there were up to 16,378 inmates on strike at the same time. It is significant that the uprising took place before the arrest of [[Lavrentiy Beria]] and its suppression coincided with news of his arrest. The preconditions for the uprising can be seen as the following: the arrival of waves of prisoners to the Gorlag, who had participated in the uprisings of 1952, the death of Stalin on March 5, 1953 and the fact that the amnesty that followed his death only applied to (non-political) criminals and convicts with short prison terms, the percentage of which was very low in Gorlag. There were two camp systems in vicinity of [[Norilsk]]. The majority of inmates in special camp Gorlag had been convicted for political crimes. The majority of prisoners in Norillag belonged to non-political criminals, so called ''bytoviki''. The uprising was provoked by the shooting of several prisoners on the orders of the camp administration. All categories of inmates took part in the uprising, with the leading roles played by former military men and participants of national liberation movements of western [[Ukraine]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the [[Baltics]].\n\nThe inmates did not have any weapons, although initially during the inquest it was suggested by the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] to classify the uprising as \"an [[anti-Soviet]] armed [[counter-revolutionary]] uprising\". (Eventually the Soviet court used the term \"mass insubordination of the inmates to the camp administration\".) The action was not simply a strike: actions included a wide spectrum of nonviolent forms of protest within the [[Soviet law]]: meetings, letters to government,  [[hunger strike]]s. For this reason, the term \"Uprising of the Spirit\"<ref>Makarova, Alla. ''Norilsk uprising''. Volya. A  Journal of prisoners of totalitarian systems. 1993. # 1. p. 68-104.
