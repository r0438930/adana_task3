At the Kap\u0101lama campus, the process is highly selective. Acceptance rates range from approximately 6.7% to 14.7% depending on the grade for which a student applies. Acceptance rates at the Maui and Hawai{{okina}}i campuses are generally higher, ranging from approximately 9.2% to 24%, due to those islands' smaller populations and the lack of [[Boarding school|boarding]] students at those facilities.<ref name=\"admissions\" /> The current enrollment is 5,416 students.<ref name=\"aboutUs\"/>\n\nIn accordance with a century-old interpretation of the will of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, Kamehameha Schools gives preference to applicants of [[Native Hawaiian]] descent \"to the extent permitted by law.\" Orphans and indigent applicants receive special consideration as adjured in Pauahi's will.<ref name=\"admissions\">{{cite web |url= http://www.ksbe.edu/admissions/admissions.php |title= Admissions: A Brief History of Kamehameha Schools |work= official web site |publisher= Kamehameha Schools |accessdate= 2009-12-10 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090918220553/http://ksbe.edu/admissions/admissions.php |archivedate= 2009-09-18 }}</ref> Preference applicants must submit evidence verifying that at least one of their pre-1959 ancestors is Hawaiian.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ksbe.edu/datacenter/hooulu-faq.php |title= Ho'oulu Hawaiian Data Center Frequently Asked Questions |work= official web site |publisher= Kamehameha Schools |accessdate= 2009-12-10 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090831142531/http://www.ksbe.edu/datacenter/hooulu-faq.php |archivedate= 2009-08-31 }}</ref>\n\nThe schools' admissions policy has been a subject of controversy. Because far more applicants claim Hawaiian ancestry than the schools can admit, virtually all students have some Native Hawaiian ancestry. Non-Hawaiians have attended, but this is extremely rare. In 2002, Kamehameha admitted one non-Hawaiian student, Kalani Rosell, to its Maui campus, for the first time in 40&nbsp;years. Rosell was admitted after all qualified Hawaiian applicants had been admitted. This decision sparked alumni protest.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Kamehameha's admissions policy was the focus of two federal lawsuits, which contended that preferring Native Hawaiians is a race-based exclusion that violates U.S. civil rights law. Both lawsuits have since been settled and the admission policy stands today.\n\n=== Mohica-Cummings lawsuit ===\nIn August 2003, Brayden Gay Mohica-Cummings was a seventh-grader admitted to Kap\u0101lama Heights after his mother, who is the ''[[h\u0101nai]]'' (adopted) daughter of a Hawaiian family,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Viotti|first1=Vicki|last2=Gordon|first2=Mike|title=Kamehameha settlement OK'd|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2003/Dec/05/ln/ln20a.html|accessdate=17 December 2014|agency=Honolulu Advertiser|date=December 5, 2003}}</ref> said he was Hawaiian.

The dissent stated that civil rights law \"prohibits a [https://www.privateschoolreview.com/ private school] from denying admission to prospective students because of their race.\" It was very skeptical of the majority interpretation, stating, \"The fact that Congress has passed some measures promoting Native Hawaiian education says nothing about whether Congress intended to exempt Native Hawaiian schools from \u00a7 1981 [civil rights law]\".\n\nFollowing the decision, attorneys appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. However, before the Supreme Court decided whether to hear the case, ''Doe v. Kamehameha'' was also settled. Both this settlement and the Ninth Circuit's decision prompted a procession at the Kapalama High School, leading to an all-school assembly.

Because far more applicants claim Hawaiian ancestry than the schools can admit, virtually all students have some Native Hawaiian ancestry. Non-Hawaiians have attended, but this is extremely rare. In 2002, Kamehameha admitted one non-Hawaiian student, Kalani Rosell, to its Maui campus, for the first time in 40&nbsp;years. Rosell was admitted after all qualified Hawaiian applicants had been admitted. This decision sparked alumni protest.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Kamehameha's admissions policy was the focus of two federal lawsuits, which contended that preferring Native Hawaiians is a race-based exclusion that violates U.S. civil rights law.

The dissent stated that civil rights law \"prohibits a [https://www.privateschoolreview.com/ private school] from denying admission to prospective students because of their race.\" It was very skeptical of the majority interpretation, stating, \"The fact that Congress has passed some measures promoting Native Hawaiian education says nothing about whether Congress intended to exempt Native Hawaiian schools from \u00a7 1981 [civil rights law]\".\n\nFollowing the decision, attorneys appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. However, before the Supreme Court decided whether to hear the case, ''Doe v. Kamehameha'' was also settled.
