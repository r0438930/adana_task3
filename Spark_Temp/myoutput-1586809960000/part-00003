It can further be argued that before they finished taking Vietnam prior to the 1950s, the communist campaigns did not succeed in Southeast Asia.  Note the [[Malayan Emergency]], the [[Hukbalahap Rebellion]] in the [[Philippines]], and the increasing involvement with [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Communists]] by [[Sukarno]] of Indonesia from the late 1950s until he was deposed in 1967.  All of these were unsuccessful Communist attempts to take over Southeast Asian countries which stalled when communist forces were still focused in Vietnam.\n\n[[Walt Whitman Rostow]] and the then [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] have argued that the U.S. intervention in Indochina, by giving the nations of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] time to consolidate and engage in economic growth, prevented a wider domino effect.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Kuan Yew |date=2000 |title=From Third World to First: The Singapore Story - 1965-2000 |location=New York |publisher=Harper Collins |page=[https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/467 467,573] |isbn=0-06-019776-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/467 }}</ref> Meeting with President [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1975, Lee Kuan Yew argued that \"there is a tendency in the U.S. Congress not to want to export jobs. But we have to have the jobs if we are to stop Communism. We have done that, moving from simple to more complex skilled labor. If we stop this process, it will do more harm than you can every[sic] repair with aid. Don't cut off imports from Southeast Asia.\"<ref>[[:File:Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975(Gerald Ford Library)(1553067).pdf|Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975 (Gerald Ford Library)]], pg. 7</ref>\n\n[[McGeorge Bundy]] argued that the prospects for a domino effect, though high in the 1950s and early 1960s, were weakened in 1965 when the [[Indonesian killings of 1965\u201366|Indonesian Communist Party was destroyed]] via death squads in the Indonesian genocide.  However, proponents believe that the efforts during the containment (i.e., Domino Theory) period ultimately led to the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.\n\nSome supporters of the domino theory note the history of communist governments supplying aid to communist revolutionaries in neighboring countries. For instance, China supplied the [[Viet Minh]], the North Vietnamese army, with troops and supplies, and the Soviet Union supplied them with tanks and heavy weapons. The fact that the Pathet Lao and Khmer Rouge were both originally part of the Vietminh, not to mention Hanoi's support for both in conjunction with the Viet Cong, also give credence to the theory.  The Soviet Union also heavily supplied Sukarno with military supplies and advisors from the time of the [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia]], especially during and after the 1958 civil war in Sumatra.\n\nLinguist and political theorist [[Noam Chomsky]] wrote that he believes that the domino theory is roughly accurate, although he put a more positive spin on the threat, writing that communist and socialist movements became popular in poorer countries because they brought economic improvements to those countries in which they took power. For this reason, he wrote, the U.S. put so much effort into suppressing so-called \"people's movements\" in [[Chile]], Vietnam, [[Nicaragua]], Laos, [[Grenada]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], etc. \"The weaker and poorer a country is, the more dangerous it is as an example. If a tiny, poor country like Grenada can succeed in bringing about a better life for its people, some other place that has more resources will ask, 'Why not us?'\" Chomsky refers to this as the \"threat of a good example\".<ref>[http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm \"The Threat of a Good Example\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724125605/http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm# |date=2015-07-24 }}, [[Noam Chomsky]]</ref>\n\n== Significance of the domino theory ==\nThe domino theory is significant because it underlines the importance of alliances, which may vary from rogue alliances to bilateral alliances. This implies that the domino theory is useful in evaluating a country\u2019s intent and purpose of forging an alliance with others, including a cluster of other countries within a particular region. While the intent and purpose may differ for every country, [[Victor Cha]] portrays the asymmetrical bilateral alliance between the United States and countries in East Asia as a strategic approach, where the United States is in control and power to either mobilize or stabilize its allies. This is supported by how the United States created asymmetrical bilateral alliances with the Republic of Korea, Republic of China and Japan \u201cnot just to contain but also constrain potential \u2018rogue alliances\u2019 from engaging in adventurist behavior that might it into larger military contingencies in the region or that could trigger a domino effect, with Asian countries falling to communism.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Since the United States struggled with the challenge of \u201crogue alliances and the threat of falling dominoes combined to produce a dreaded entrapment scenario for the United States,\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> the domino theory further underscores the importance of bilateral alliances in international relations. This is evident in how the domino theory provided the United States with a coalition approach, where it \u201cfashioned a series of deep, tight bilateral alliances\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> with Asian countries including Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan to \u201ccontrol their ability to use force and to foster material and political dependency on the United States.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Hence, this indicates that the domino theory assists in observing the effect of forged alliances as a stepping stone or stumbling block within international relations. This underscores the correlation between domino theory and path dependency, where a retrospective collapse of one country falling to communism may not only have adverse effects to other countries but more importantly, on one\u2019s decision-making scope and competence in overcoming present and future challenges. Therefore, the domino theory is indubitably a significant theory which deals with the close relationship between micro-cause and macro-consequence, where it suggests such macro-consequences may result in long-term repercussions. \n\n==Applications to communism outside Southeast Asia==\n[[Michael Lind]] has argued that though the domino theory failed regionally, there was a global wave, as communist or [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] regimes came to power in [[People's Republic of Benin|Benin]], [[Derg|Ethiopia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar|Madagascar]], [[Cape Verde]], [[People's Republic of Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Angola]], [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|Grenada]], and [[Nicaragua]] during the 1970s. The global interpretation of the domino effect relies heavily upon the \"prestige\" interpretation of the theory, meaning that the success of Communist revolutions in some countries, though it did not provide material support to revolutionary forces in other countries, did contribute morale and rhetorical support.\n\nIn this vein, Argentine revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] wrote an essay, the \"Message to the Tricontinental\", in 1967, calling for \"two, three ... many Vietnams\" across the world.<ref>[http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm \"Rough Draft of History: 'All Right, Let's Get the  @#!*%  Out of Here'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126071737/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm |date=2005-11-26 }}, Richard Gott, August 11, 2005</ref> Historian [[Max Boot]] wrote, \"In the late 1970s, America's enemies seized power in countries from Mozambique to Iran to Nicaragua.

It can further be argued that before they finished taking Vietnam prior to the 1950s, the communist campaigns did not succeed in Southeast Asia.  Note the [[Malayan Emergency]], the [[Hukbalahap Rebellion]] in the [[Philippines]], and the increasing involvement with [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Communists]] by [[Sukarno]] of Indonesia from the late 1950s until he was deposed in 1967.  All of these were unsuccessful Communist attempts to take over Southeast Asian countries which stalled when communist forces were still focused in Vietnam.\n\n[[Walt Whitman Rostow]] and the then [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] have argued that the U.S. intervention in Indochina, by giving the nations of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] time to consolidate and engage in economic growth, prevented a wider domino effect.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Kuan Yew |date=2000 |title=From Third World to First: The Singapore Story - 1965-2000 |location=New York |publisher=Harper Collins |page=[https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/467 467,573] |isbn=0-06-019776-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/467 }}</ref> Meeting with President [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1975, Lee Kuan Yew argued that \"there is a tendency in the U.S. Congress not to want to export jobs.

If we stop this process, it will do more harm than you can every[sic] repair with aid. Don't cut off imports from Southeast Asia.\"<ref>[[:File:Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975(Gerald Ford Library)(1553067).pdf|Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975 (Gerald Ford Library)]], pg. 7</ref>\n\n[[McGeorge Bundy]] argued that the prospects for a domino effect, though high in the 1950s and early 1960s, were weakened in 1965 when the [[Indonesian killings of 1965\u201366|Indonesian Communist Party was destroyed]] via death squads in the Indonesian genocide.  However, proponents believe that the efforts during the containment (i.e., Domino Theory) period ultimately led to the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.\n\nSome supporters of the domino theory note the history of communist governments supplying aid to communist revolutionaries in neighboring countries. For instance, China supplied the [[Viet Minh]], the North Vietnamese army, with troops and supplies, and the Soviet Union supplied them with tanks and heavy weapons. The fact that the Pathet Lao and Khmer Rouge were both originally part of the Vietminh, not to mention Hanoi's support for both in conjunction with the Viet Cong, also give credence to the theory.  The Soviet Union also heavily supplied Sukarno with military supplies and advisors from the time of the [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia]], especially during and after the 1958 civil war in Sumatra.\n\nLinguist and political theorist [[Noam Chomsky]] wrote that he believes that the domino theory is roughly accurate, although he put a more positive spin on the threat, writing that communist and socialist movements became popular in poorer countries because they brought economic improvements to those countries in which they took power. For this reason, he wrote, the U.S. put so much effort into suppressing so-called \"people's movements\" in [[Chile]], Vietnam, [[Nicaragua]], Laos, [[Grenada]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], etc. \"The weaker and poorer a country is, the more dangerous it is as an example. If a tiny, poor country like Grenada can succeed in bringing about a better life for its people, some other place that has more resources will ask, 'Why not us?'\" Chomsky refers to this as the \"threat of a good example\".<ref>[http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm \"The Threat of a Good Example\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724125605/http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm# |date=2015-07-24 }}, [[Noam Chomsky]]</ref>\n\n== Significance of the domino theory ==\nThe domino theory is significant because it underlines the importance of alliances, which may vary from rogue alliances to bilateral alliances. This implies that the domino theory is useful in evaluating a country\u2019s intent and purpose of forging an alliance with others, including a cluster of other countries within a particular region. While the intent and purpose may differ for every country, [[Victor Cha]] portrays the asymmetrical bilateral alliance between the United States and countries in East Asia as a strategic approach, where the United States is in control and power to either mobilize or stabilize its allies. This is supported by how the United States created asymmetrical bilateral alliances with the Republic of Korea, Republic of China and Japan \u201cnot just to contain but also constrain potential \u2018rogue alliances\u2019 from engaging in adventurist behavior that might it into larger military contingencies in the region or that could trigger a domino effect, with Asian countries falling to communism.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Since the United States struggled with the challenge of \u201crogue alliances and the threat of falling dominoes combined to produce a dreaded entrapment scenario for the United States,\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> the domino theory further underscores the importance of bilateral alliances in international relations. This is evident in how the domino theory provided the United States with a coalition approach, where it \u201cfashioned a series of deep, tight bilateral alliances\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> with Asian countries including Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan to \u201ccontrol their ability to use force and to foster material and political dependency on the United States.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Hence, this indicates that the domino theory assists in observing the effect of forged alliances as a stepping stone or stumbling block within international relations. This underscores the correlation between domino theory and path dependency, where a retrospective collapse of one country falling to communism may not only have adverse effects to other countries but more importantly, on one\u2019s decision-making scope and competence in overcoming present and future challenges. Therefore, the domino theory is indubitably a significant theory which deals with the close relationship between micro-cause and macro-consequence, where it suggests such macro-consequences may result in long-term repercussions. \n\n==Applications to communism outside Southeast Asia==\n[[Michael Lind]] has argued that though the domino theory failed regionally, there was a global wave, as communist or [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] regimes came to power in [[People's Republic of Benin|Benin]], [[Derg|Ethiopia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar|Madagascar]], [[Cape Verde]], [[People's Republic of Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Angola]], [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|Grenada]], and [[Nicaragua]] during the 1970s. The global interpretation of the domino effect relies heavily upon the \"prestige\" interpretation of the theory, meaning that the success of Communist revolutions in some countries, though it did not provide material support to revolutionary forces in other countries, did contribute morale and rhetorical support.\n\nIn this vein, Argentine revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] wrote an essay, the \"Message to the Tricontinental\", in 1967, calling for \"two, three ... many Vietnams\" across the world.<ref>[http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm \"Rough Draft of History: 'All Right, Let's Get the  @#!*%  Out of Here'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126071737/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm |date=2005-11-26 }}, Richard Gott, August 11, 2005</ref> Historian [[Max Boot]] wrote, \"In the late 1970s, America's enemies seized power in countries from Mozambique to Iran to Nicaragua.
