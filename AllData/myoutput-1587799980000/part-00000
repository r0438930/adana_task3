At some point in the ninth- or tenth century, the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] expanded substantially southwards. As a result of this extension far beyond the valley of the [[River Clyde]], the realm became known as the [[Kingdom of Cumbria]]. By 927, the kingdom seems to have reached as far south as the [[River Eamont]].\n\nDyfnwal appears to have reigned between the 930s and the 970s. He is first attested in the 940s, when he is recorded associated with the ecclesiast [[Cathr\u00f3e of Metz|Cathr\u00f3e]] on the latter's journey to [[Continental Europe]]. At the midpoint of the decade, the Cumbrian kingdom was ravaged by the forces of [[Edmund, King of the English]]. Two of Dyfnwal's sons are said to have been blinded by the English, which could indicate that Dyfnwal had broken a pledge to his southern counterpart. One possibility is that he had harboured insular Scandinavian opponents of Edmund. The latter is recorded to have handed over control of the Cumbrian realm to [[M\u00e1el Coluim mac Domnaill, King of Alba]]. How much authority the Scots enjoyed over the Cumbrian realm is uncertain.\n\nIn 971, the reigning [[Cuil\u00e9n|Cuil\u00e9n mac Illuilb, King of Alba]] was slain by [[Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal]]. At some point after this act, Cuil\u00e9n's eventual successor, [[Cin\u00e1ed mac Ma\u00edl Choluim|Cin\u00e1ed mac Ma\u00edl Choluim, King of Alba]], is recorded to have penetrated deep into Cumbrian territory, possibly as a retaliatory act. The following year, the reigning [[Edgar, King of the English]] held a remarkable assembly at [[Chester]] which numerous northern kings seem to have attended. Both Dyfnwal and his son, [[M\u00e1el Coluim, King of Strathclyde|M\u00e1el Coluim]], appear to have attended this assembly. The latter is styled King of the Cumbrians in the context of this meeting, which might indicate that Dyfnwal had previously abdicated the throne.\n\nDyfnwal is recorded to have died in 975 whilst undertaking a pilgrimage to [[Rome]]. Quite when he gave up the throne is unknown. One possibility is that Rhydderch had succeeded him before the killing of Cuil\u00e9n. Another possibility is that the apparent retaliatory raid by Cin\u00e1ed marked the end of Dyfnwal's kingship. It is also possible that he held on to power until 973 or 975. In any event, M\u00e1el Coluim appears to have been succeeded by another son of Dyfnwal named [[Owain ap Dyfnwal (died 1015)|Owain]], who is recorded to have died in 1015. The later [[Owain Foel, King of Strathclyde]], who is attested in 1018, may well be a grandson of Dyfnwal. Dyfnwal is likely the [[eponym]] of [[Dunmail Raise]] in England, and possibly [[Cardonald]], [[Dundonald, South Ayrshire|Dundonald]]/[[Dundonald Castle]] in Scotland.\n\n==Background: the tenth century Cumbrian realm==\n\n[[File:Dyfnwal ab Owain (map).png|thumb|upright|alt=Map of northern Britain |Locations relating to the life and times of Dyfnwal.]]\n\nFor hundreds of years until the late ninth century, the power centre of the [[Kingdom of Al Clud]] was the fortress of [[Al Clud (fortress)|Al Clud]] (\"Rock of the Clyde\").<ref>[[#C10|Charles-Edwards (2013b)]] p. 8; [[#C11|Clancy (2006)]].</ref> In 870, this [[Celtic Britons|British]] stronghold was [[Siege of Dumbarton|seized]] by Irish-based [[Vikings|Scandinavians]],<ref>[[#E2|Edmonds (2015)]] p. 44; [[#C10|Charles-Edwards (2013b)]] pp. 9, 480; [[#C7|Clarkson (2012a)]] ch. 8 \u00b6 21; [[#C3|Clarkson (2010)]] ch. 8 \u00b6 20; [[#D4|Davies (2009)]] p. 73; [[#DZZ1|Downham (2007)]] pp. 66, 142, 162; [[#C11|Clancy (2006)]]; [[#E5|Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al.

At some point in the ninth- or tenth century, the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] expanded substantially southwards. As a result of this extension far beyond the valley of the [[River Clyde]], the realm became known as the [[Kingdom of Cumbria]]. By 927, the kingdom seems to have reached as far south as the [[River Eamont]].\n\nDyfnwal appears to have reigned between the 930s and the 970s. He is first attested in the 940s, when he is recorded associated with the ecclesiast [[Cathr\u00f3e of Metz|Cathr\u00f3e]] on the latter's journey to [[Continental Europe]]. At the midpoint of the decade, the Cumbrian kingdom was ravaged by the forces of [[Edmund, King of the English]]. Two of Dyfnwal's sons are said to have been blinded by the English, which could indicate that Dyfnwal had broken a pledge to his southern counterpart. One possibility is that he had harboured insular Scandinavian opponents of Edmund. The latter is recorded to have handed over control of the Cumbrian realm to [[M\u00e1el Coluim mac Domnaill, King of Alba]]. How much authority the Scots enjoyed over the Cumbrian realm is uncertain.\n\nIn 971, the reigning [[Cuil\u00e9n|Cuil\u00e9n mac Illuilb, King of Alba]] was slain by [[Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal]]. At some point after this act, Cuil\u00e9n's eventual successor, [[Cin\u00e1ed mac Ma\u00edl Choluim|Cin\u00e1ed mac Ma\u00edl Choluim, King of Alba]], is recorded to have penetrated deep into Cumbrian territory, possibly as a retaliatory act. The following year, the reigning [[Edgar, King of the English]] held a remarkable assembly at [[Chester]] which numerous northern kings seem to have attended. Both Dyfnwal and his son, [[M\u00e1el Coluim, King of Strathclyde|M\u00e1el Coluim]], appear to have attended this assembly. The latter is styled King of the Cumbrians in the context of this meeting, which might indicate that Dyfnwal had previously abdicated the throne.\n\nDyfnwal is recorded to have died in 975 whilst undertaking a pilgrimage to [[Rome]]. Quite when he gave up the throne is unknown. One possibility is that Rhydderch had succeeded him before the killing of Cuil\u00e9n. Another possibility is that the apparent retaliatory raid by Cin\u00e1ed marked the end of Dyfnwal's kingship. It is also possible that he held on to power until 973 or 975. In any event, M\u00e1el Coluim appears to have been succeeded by another son of Dyfnwal named [[Owain ap Dyfnwal (died 1015)|Owain]], who is recorded to have died in 1015. The later [[Owain Foel, King of Strathclyde]], who is attested in 1018, may well be a grandson of Dyfnwal. Dyfnwal is likely the [[eponym]] of [[Dunmail Raise]] in England, and possibly [[Cardonald]], [[Dundonald, South Ayrshire|Dundonald]]/[[Dundonald Castle]] in Scotland.\n\n==Background: the tenth century Cumbrian realm==\n\n[[File:Dyfnwal ab Owain (map).png|thumb|upright|alt=Map of northern Britain |Locations relating to the life and times of Dyfnwal.]]\n\nFor hundreds of years until the late ninth century, the power centre of the [[Kingdom of Al Clud]] was the fortress of [[Al Clud (fortress)|Al Clud]] (\"Rock of the Clyde\").<ref>[[#C10|Charles-Edwards (2013b)]] p. 8; [[#C11|Clancy (2006)]].</ref> In 870, this [[Celtic Britons|British]] stronghold was [[Siege of Dumbarton|seized]] by Irish-based [[Vikings|Scandinavians]],<ref>[[#E2|Edmonds (2015)]] p. 44; [[#C10|Charles-Edwards (2013b)]] pp. 9, 480; [[#C7|Clarkson (2012a)]] ch. 8 \u00b6 21; [[#C3|Clarkson (2010)]] ch. 8 \u00b6 20; [[#D4|Davies (2009)]] p. 73; [[#DZZ1|Downham (2007)]] pp. 66, 142, 162; [[#C11|Clancy (2006)]]; [[#E5|Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al.
