It went on to spin off a unit of fortress engineers and provided a signals training centre during [[World War I]]. Its successor units provided signal support for West Lancashire [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) formations in the early stages of [[World War II]], and for [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army HQ]] during the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]], the advance to [[Tunisian Campaign|Tunis]], invasion of [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily]] and through [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]], ending the war in [[Austria]]. Postwar successor units have continued in the TA and [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]] to the present day.\n\n==Origins==\nThe enthusiasm for the [[Volunteer movement]] following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle, Artillery and Engineer Volunteer units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular [[British Army]] in time of need.<ref>Beckett.</ref> One such unit was the '''1st Lancashire Engineer Volunteer Corps''' (EVC) formed at [[Liverpool]] on 1 October 1860. In the early part of 1864 it absorbed the 2nd Lancashire EVC, which had been formed at Liverpool on 29 December 1860 (the 3rd Lancashire EVC at [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]] became the new 2nd).<ref>Beckett, Appendix IX.</ref><ref name = Westlake>Westlake, pp. 10\u201311.</ref><ref>[http://new.lancashire.gov.uk/media/52092/Handlist72militiaandvolunteers.pdf  LRO Handlist 72.]</ref><ref name = Regts>{{Cite web |url=http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vengr/la1.htm |title=1st Lancashire Engineers at Regiments.org. |access-date=2005-11-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051116072355/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vengr/la1.htm |archive-date=2005-11-16 |url-status=live }}</ref> The unit ranked 4th (later 3rd) in the list of precedence of EVCs, and by 1866 it consisted of eight companies, with its headquarters at 44 Mason Street, [[Edge Hill, Liverpool]].<ref name = MAL>''Monthly Army List''.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1860s the 1st Lancashire EVC acted as a battalion headquarters, with several smaller EVCs attached to it: 1st Flintshire EVC (1863\u20131897); 1st Cheshire EVC (1864) and 2nd (St Helens) Lancashire EVC (1864\u20131867).
