When the studio shelved the film fearing that it would receive an NC-17 rating,<ref name=\"fangoria\">{{cite journal|work=Fangoria|issue=199|pages=20\u201325|title=Death to False Horror|author=Szulkin, David}}</ref> Zombie re-acquired the rights and were eventually sold to [[Lions Gate Entertainment]], who released the film in April 2003. Despite receiving an unfavorable response from critics, it went on to gross $16 million worldwide. Since its release, the film has achieved a [[cult following]], was developed into a haunted house attraction by Zombie for Universal Studios, and was followed by two sequels, ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'' (2005) and ''[[3 from Hell]]'' (2019).\n\n==Plot==\nOn October 30, 1977, amateur criminals Killer Karl and Richard Wick attempt an armed robbery at a gas station, but are killed by the owner, [[Captain Spaulding (Rob Zombie character)|Captain Spaulding]], and his assistant, Ravelli. Later on, Jerry Goldsmith, Bill Hudley, Mary Knowles, and Denise Willis are on the road in hopes of writing a book on offbeat [[roadside attraction]]s. When the four meet Spaulding, who is also the owner of \"The Museum of Monsters & Madmen\", they learn of the local legend of Dr. Satan. As they take off in search of the tree from which Dr. Satan was hanged, they pick up a young free-spirited [[hitchhiker]] named Baby, who claims to live only a few miles away. Shortly after, the vehicle's tire bursts (in what is later seen to be a trap) and Baby takes Bill to her family's house. Moments later, Baby's half-brother, Rufus, picks up the stranded passengers and takes them to the family home.\n\nThere they meet Baby's family: her adopted brother [[Otis Driftwood]], her deformed giant half-brother [[Tiny Firefly|Tiny]], Mother Firefly, and Grandpa Hugo. While being treated to dinner, Mother Firefly explains that her ex-husband, Earl, had previously tried to burn Tiny alive, along with the Firefly house, after he suffered a psychotic breakdown. After dinner, the family puts on a Halloween show for their guests and Baby offends Mary by flirting with Bill. After Mary threatens Baby, Rufus tells them their car is repaired. As the couples leave, Otis and Tiny, disguised as [[scarecrow]]s, attack them in the driveway and take them prisoner. The next day, Otis kills Bill and mutilates his body for art. Mary is tied up in a barn, Denise is tied to a bed while dressed up for Halloween, and Jerry is partially [[Scalping|scalped]] for failing to guess Baby's favorite movie star.\n\nWhen Denise doesn't come home, her father Don calls the police to report her missing. Two deputies, George Wydell and Steve Naish, find the couples' abandoned car in a field with a dead, mutilated cheerleader in the trunk. Don, a former policeman, is called to the scene to help the deputies search. They arrive at the Firefly house and Wydell questions Mother Firefly about the missing teens. Mother Firefly shoots Wydell in the head and kills him; Don and Steve are then killed by Otis when they find more bodies of missing cheerleaders in the barn. Later that night, the three remaining teenagers are dressed as rabbits and taken out to an abandoned well. Mary attempts to run away, but is tracked down and stabbed to death by Baby moments later.\n\nMeanwhile, Jerry and Denise are lowered into the well, where a group of Dr. Satan's failed experiments pull Jerry away, leaving Denise to find her way through an underground lair. As she wanders through the tunnels, she encounters Dr. Satan and a number of [[Intellectual disability|mental patients]]; Jerry is on Dr. Satan's operating table being [[Vivisection|vivisected]] and dies as Denise screams. Dr. Satan tells his mutated assistant, who turns out to be Mother Firefly's ex-husband Earl, to capture Denise, but Denise outwits him and escapes the chambers by crawling to the surface as he is crushed by falling debris. She makes her way to the main road, where she encounters Captain Spaulding, who gives her a ride in his car. She passes out from exhaustion in the front seat, and Otis suddenly appears in the back seat with a knife. Denise later wakes up to find herself strapped to Dr. Satan's operating table, and she screams in horror.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Rob Zombie characters}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Sid Haig]] as [[Captain Spaulding (Rob Zombie character)|Captain Spaulding]]\n* [[Bill Moseley]] as Otis\n* [[Sheri Moon Zombie]] as Baby\n* [[Karen Black]] as Mother Firefly\n* [[Chris Hardwick]] as Jerry Goldsmith\n* [[Erin Daniels]] as Denise Willis\n* [[Jennifer Jostyn]] as Mary Knowles\n* [[Rainn Wilson]] as Bill Hudley\n* [[Walton Goggins]] as Steve Naish\n* [[Tom Towles]] as Deputy George Wydell\n* [[Matthew McGrory]] as Tiny\n* [[Robert Allen Mukes]] as Rufus\n* [[Dennis Fimple]] as Grandpa Hugo\n* [[Harrison Young]] as Don Willis\n* [[William Bassett (actor)|William Bassett]] as Sheriff Frank Huston\n* [[Irwin Keyes]] as Ravelli\n* [[Michael J.

Zombie later cited home recordings from the [[Charles Manson|Manson family]] as inspiration for the Firefly family's \"bizarre\" rants. Zombie often filmed two versions of scenes, one of them less gory, in an attempt to please Universal.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nJake McKinnon could not see well when dressed as The Professor, and almost hit actress Erin Daniels with a real ax during the film's climax. Zombie later said he had simply hoped Daniels would move out of the way in time. When Denise calls her father from a telephone booth, a sign for a missing dog head can be seen hanging in the booth; this was in fact a real item found by Zombie and used for the film. In the early stages of the film, Grandpa Hugo was to have been revealed as the murderous Dr. Satan, who at the time was simply referred to as the mad doctor. The legend of the mad doctor was to be a ploy by the Firefly family to lure victims in, though this idea was later scrapped. This led to Grandpa Hugo receiving much less screen time. The character of Dr. Satan was inspired by a 1950s billboard-sized poster advertising a \"live spook show starring a magician called Dr. Satan\" that Zombie has in his house.<ref>{{Citation | last = Ulmer | first = Gary | title = Interview with the Zombie | periodical = Dark Realms Magazine | pages = 14\u201316 | volume = issue 11 | date = Summer 2003 | url = http://www.monolithgraphics.com/darkrealms.html}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n{{Main|List of Rob Zombie characters}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| footer    = Bill Moseley (left) and Sid Haig (right) were generally praised by film critics for their roles in the film.\n| image1    = Billgfdl.jpg\n| width1    = 180\n| image2    = Haig, Sid (2007).jpg\n| width2    = 200\n}}\nThe film's main cast consisted of the murderous Firefly family, the four teenagers and various police officers attempting to find the group, among others.<ref name=\"horrorhound\">{{citation|last =Newell|first =Eric|title=House of 1000 Corpses|journal=Horror Hound|volume=1|issue=36|pages=26\u201333| year= 2012}}</ref> Sid Haig was cast as Captain Spaulding, a man who dresses as a clown and owns a gas station and museum of curiosities.<ref name=\"horrorhound\"/> Haig claimed he had to \"get in touch with [his] own insanity\" for the role.<ref name=aboutfilm>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutfilm.com/features/devilsrejects/castinterviews.htm|title=Devil's Rejects - Cast Interviews|accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref> His relation to the Firefly family is not revealed in the film, though he is working with them to some extent; however, the sequel establishes that he is the father of Baby.

Despite receiving an unfavorable response from critics, it went on to gross $16 million worldwide. Since its release, the film has achieved a [[cult following]], was developed into a haunted house attraction by Zombie for Universal Studios, and was followed by two sequels, ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'' (2005) and ''[[3 from Hell]]'' (2019).\n\n==Plot==\nOn October 30, 1977, amateur criminals Killer Karl and Richard Wick attempt an armed robbery at a gas station, but are killed by the owner, [[Captain Spaulding (Rob Zombie character)|Captain Spaulding]], and his assistant, Ravelli. Later on, Jerry Goldsmith, Bill Hudley, Mary Knowles, and Denise Willis are on the road in hopes of writing a book on offbeat [[roadside attraction]]s. When the four meet Spaulding, who is also the owner of \"The Museum of Monsters & Madmen\", they learn of the local legend of Dr. Satan. As they take off in search of the tree from which Dr. Satan was hanged, they pick up a young free-spirited [[hitchhiker]] named Baby, who claims to live only a few miles away. Shortly after, the vehicle's tire bursts (in what is later seen to be a trap) and Baby takes Bill to her family's house. Moments later, Baby's half-brother, Rufus, picks up the stranded passengers and takes them to the family home.\n\nThere they meet Baby's family: her adopted brother [[Otis Driftwood]], her deformed giant half-brother [[Tiny Firefly|Tiny]], Mother Firefly, and Grandpa Hugo. While being treated to dinner, Mother Firefly explains that her ex-husband, Earl, had previously tried to burn Tiny alive, along with the Firefly house, after he suffered a psychotic breakdown. After dinner, the family puts on a Halloween show for their guests and Baby offends Mary by flirting with Bill. After Mary threatens Baby, Rufus tells them their car is repaired. As the couples leave, Otis and Tiny, disguised as [[scarecrow]]s, attack them in the driveway and take them prisoner. The next day, Otis kills Bill and mutilates his body for art. Mary is tied up in a barn, Denise is tied to a bed while dressed up for Halloween, and Jerry is partially [[Scalping|scalped]] for failing to guess Baby's favorite movie star.\n\nWhen Denise doesn't come home, her father Don calls the police to report her missing. Two deputies, George Wydell and Steve Naish, find the couples' abandoned car in a field with a dead, mutilated cheerleader in the trunk. Don, a former policeman, is called to the scene to help the deputies search. They arrive at the Firefly house and Wydell questions Mother Firefly about the missing teens. Mother Firefly shoots Wydell in the head and kills him; Don and Steve are then killed by Otis when they find more bodies of missing cheerleaders in the barn. Later that night, the three remaining teenagers are dressed as rabbits and taken out to an abandoned well. Mary attempts to run away, but is tracked down and stabbed to death by Baby moments later.\n\nMeanwhile, Jerry and Denise are lowered into the well, where a group of Dr. Satan's failed experiments pull Jerry away, leaving Denise to find her way through an underground lair. As she wanders through the tunnels, she encounters Dr. Satan and a number of [[Intellectual disability|mental patients]]; Jerry is on Dr. Satan's operating table being [[Vivisection|vivisected]] and dies as Denise screams. Dr. Satan tells his mutated assistant, who turns out to be Mother Firefly's ex-husband Earl, to capture Denise, but Denise outwits him and escapes the chambers by crawling to the surface as he is crushed by falling debris. She makes her way to the main road, where she encounters Captain Spaulding, who gives her a ride in his car. She passes out from exhaustion in the front seat, and Otis suddenly appears in the back seat with a knife.
