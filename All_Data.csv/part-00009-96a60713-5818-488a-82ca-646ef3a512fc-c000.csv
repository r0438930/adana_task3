The '''Fresno State Bulldogs football statistical leaders''' are individual statistical leaders of the [[Fresno State Bulldogs football]] program in various categories,<ref name=\"MG\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.gobulldogs.com/news/2016/7/31/2016-football-media-guide.aspx?path=football|title = 2016 Fresno State Bulldogs Media Guide|accessdate = 2016-08-20|website = GoBulldogs.com|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160920005915/http://www.gobulldogs.com/news/2016/7/31/2016-football-media-guide.aspx?path=football#|archive-date = 2016-09-20|url-status = live}}</ref> including [[forward pass|passing]], [[Rush (American football)|rushing]], [[Reception (American football)|receiving]], [[total offense]], defensive stats, and [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|kicking]]. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bulldogs represent [[California State University, Fresno]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Mountain West Conference]] (MW).

Fresno State began competing in intercollegiate football in 1921,<ref name=\"MG\" /> but these lists are dominated by more recent players for several reasons:
* Since 1979, seasons have increased from 10 games to 11 and then 12 games in length.
* The NCAA didn't allow freshmen to play varsity football until [[1972 college football season|1972]] (with the exception of the [[World War II]] years), allowing players to have four-year careers.
* [[Bowl game]]s only began counting toward single-season and career statistics in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://a.espncdn.com/ncf/news/2002/0828/1423821.html|title = NCAA changes policy on football stats|date = 2002-08-28|accessdate = 2016-08-20|website = ESPN.com|publisher = AP|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160601212457/http://a.espncdn.com/ncf/news/2002/0828/1423821.html#|archive-date = 2016-06-01|url-status = live}}</ref> The Bulldogs have played in 11 bowl games since this decision, giving many recent players an extra game to accumulate statistics.
* Similarly, the Bulldogs have appeared in the [[Mountain West Conference Football Championship Game]] twice since it began in 2013.
* Additionally, Fresno State has been grouped in the same MW football division as [[Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football|Hawaii]] since divisional play began in 2013, meaning that it plays at Hawaii every other year (currently in even-numbered years). This is relevant because the NCAA allows teams that play at Hawaii in a given season to schedule 13 regular-season games instead of the normal 12. The Bulldogs have played a 13-game regular season once since divisional play began, in 2014. 

These lists are updated through the end of the [[2020 Fresno State Bulldogs football team|2020 season]].

The '''Fresno State Bulldogs football statistical leaders''' are individual statistical leaders of the [[Fresno State Bulldogs football]] program in various categories,<ref name=\"MG\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.gobulldogs.com/news/2016/7/31/2016-football-media-guide.aspx?path=football|title = 2016 Fresno State Bulldogs Media Guide|accessdate = 2016-08-20|website = GoBulldogs.com|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160920005915/http://www.gobulldogs.com/news/2016/7/31/2016-football-media-guide.aspx?path=football#|archive-date = 2016-09-20|url-status = live}}</ref> including [[forward pass|passing]], [[Rush (American football)|rushing]], [[Reception (American football)|receiving]], [[total offense]], defensive stats, and [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|kicking]]. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bulldogs represent [[California State University, Fresno]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Mountain West Conference]] (MW).

Fresno State began competing in intercollegiate football in 1921,<ref name=\"MG\" /> but these lists are dominated by more recent players for several reasons:
* Since 1979, seasons have increased from 10 games to 11 and then 12 games in length.
* The NCAA didn't allow freshmen to play varsity football until [[1972 college football season|1972]] (with the exception of the [[World War II]] years), allowing players to have four-year careers.
* [[Bowl game]]s only began counting toward single-season and career statistics in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://a.espncdn.com/ncf/news/2002/0828/1423821.html|title = NCAA changes policy on football stats|date = 2002-08-28|accessdate = 2016-08-20|website = ESPN.com|publisher = AP|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160601212457/http://a.espncdn.com/ncf/news/2002/0828/1423821.html#|archive-date = 2016-06-01|url-status = live}}</ref> The Bulldogs have played in 11 bowl games since this decision, giving many recent players an extra game to accumulate statistics.
* Similarly, the Bulldogs have appeared in the [[Mountain West Conference Football Championship Game]] twice since it began in 2013.
* Additionally, Fresno State has been grouped in the same MW football division as [[Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football|Hawaii]] since divisional play began in 2013, meaning that it plays at Hawaii every other year (currently in even-numbered years). This is relevant because the NCAA allows teams that play at Hawaii in a given season to schedule 13 regular-season games instead of the normal 12. The Bulldogs have played a 13-game regular season once since divisional play began, in 2014. 

These lists are updated through the end of the [[2016 Fresno State Bulldogs football team|2016 season]].

The '''Vickers Valiant''' is a British high-altitude jet [[bomber]], and was part of the [[Royal Air Force]]'s \"[[V bomber]]\" nuclear weapon equipped strategic deterrent in the 1950s and 1960s. It was developed by [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] in response to [[Air Ministry specification|Specification B.35/46]] issued by the [[Air Ministry]] for a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] jet-powered bomber. The Valiant was the first of the V bombers to become operational, and was followed by the [[Handley Page Victor]] and the [[Avro Vulcan]], which were more advanced. The Valiant has the distinction of being the only V bomber to have dropped live nuclear weapons.<ref name = \"black wright 33\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 33.</ref>

The Valiant was intended as a high-altitude [[strategic bomber]]. During the late 1950s, in response to rapid advances in [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) technology, the Valiant fleet was switched to flying low-level for the strike role. Beyond the [[nuclear deterrence]] role, the Valiant was also used by the RAF for other purposes, as a number were converted to perform support roles such as [[aerial refuelling]] tankers and [[aerial reconnaissance]] aircraft. Valiants were used for conventional bombing missions over [[Egypt]] for [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956.

By late 1964 it was found that all variants of the Valiant showed premature fatigue and inter-crystalline corrosion in wing spar attachment forgings, traced to the use of a poorly understood aluminium alloy, DTD683.<ref>“Pitfalls of the substitution of sophistication for Common Sense”  D Howe, Cranfield University. IMechE Vol 212 Part G, Sec 5.1 Metals, p. 307. May 1998</ref>{{#tag:ref|The rapid development of aircraft during World War II led to a demand for very high strength aluminium alloy, especially for use in highly loaded tension and compression members. One result was a zinc /magnesium based alloy given the identification DTD 683. It was ideal for such applications as wing spar caps providing, as was the case with wartime operations, the life of the aircraft was short. Use in early post-War transport aircraft showed that DTD 683 was very crack-sensitive and hence prone to fatigue failure. In many cases it had to be replaced by steel components. DTD 683 is an example of a material developed to meet a particular need, but whose wider characteristics were not investigated until too late.
D.Howe 1998|group=N}} Rather than proceeding with an expensive rebuilding program, the Ministry of Defence retired the Valiant in 1965. Its duties were continued by the other V-bombers which remained in service until the 1980s.

==Development==
===Background and origins===
In November 1944, the Joint Technical Warfare  Committee, along with a separate committee chaired by Sir [[Henry Tizard]], examined the future potential  of \"weapons of war\" and the accompanying Tizard Report published on 3 July 1945 made specific policy directions for the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]].<ref name=\"Turpin p. 71\">Turpin 2002, p. 71.</ref> After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the policy of using heavy four-engined bombers for massed raids continued into the immediate postwar period; the [[Avro Lincoln]], an updated version of the [[Avro Lancaster]], became the RAF's standard bomber.<ref>McLelland 2013, p. 18.</ref> In 1946, the [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] issued Operational Requirements OR229 and OR230 for the development of [[jet aircraft|turbojet]]-powered heavy bombers capable of carrying [[nuclear weapon]]s at high altitude and speed, without defensive armament, to act as a deterrent to hostile powers and, if deterrence failed, to perform a nuclear strike.<ref name=\"Turpin p. 71\"/> In conjunction with this ambition, Britain set about developing its own [[nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|atomic weapons]].<ref name = \"flint 131\"/>

In January 1947, the British [[Air Ministry]] issued [[Air Ministry specification|Specification B.35/46]] for an advanced jet bomber intended to carry nuclear weapons and to fly near the speed of sound at altitudes of {{cvt|50000|ft|m}}.<ref name = 'Rose 52'/> Three firms: [[Avro|A.V. Roe]], [[Handley-Page Aircraft Company|Handley-Page]] and [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] submitted advanced designs intended to meet the stringent requirements.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p397\">Burnet and Morgan  ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1980, p. 397.</ref> While [[Short Brothers]] submitted a design, by [[Geoffrey T. R. Hill]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aerocinema.com/product/the-lost-v-bomber-2.html|title=Aerocinema-The Lost V Bomber|work=aerocinema.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141124185209/http://aerocinema.com/product/the-lost-v-bomber-2.html|archivedate=24 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> that was judged too ambitious, the Air Staff accepted another submission from the company for a separate requirement, B.14/46, as \"insurance\" in case the advanced B.35/46 effort ran into trouble. Aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist described Specification B.14/46 as \"calling for little more than a traditional aircraft fitted with jet engines\"<ref name = \"bomber 72\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 72.</ref> Short submitted a conservative design to meet B.14/46, which became the [[Short Sperrin|S.A.4 Sperrin]].<ref name = 'Rose 52'/> Two prototypes were completed, the first conducting its [[maiden flight]] in 1951, but the Sperrin was ultimately relegated to research and development purposes only.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p397\"/><ref name = \"flint 131\"/>

Vickers had emerged from the Second World War as one of the world's pre-eminent companies in the field of aeronautical manufacturing and development. Furthermore, the company operated its own secretive [[Skunk Works]]-like development organisation based at Weybridge, Surrey, which had been involved in several secret wartime development projects. It was this secretive division in which the early stages of the development of the Valiant took place, including the later assembly of the initial two prototypes.<ref name = \"bomber 72 73\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 72–73.</ref> Vickers initially produced a six-engine jet bomber design proposal to meet Specification B.35/46; as rapid progress in the development of more powerful jet engines had been made, this was re-worked to a four-engine proposal in 1948.<ref name = \"bomber 73\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 73.</ref> The proposed design submitted by Vickers was relatively straightforward, being less aerodynamically advanced in comparison to competing bids made by rival firms.<ref name = \"bomber 72\"/><ref name = \"black wright 17\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 17.</ref>

Both Handley-Page and Avro had produced advanced designs for the bomber competition. These would be produced as the [[Handley Page Victor|Victor]] and the [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan]] respectively; the Air Staff decided to award contracts to each company as a form of insurance in case one of these designs failed. The submissions became known as the [[V bomber]]s, or V-class, with the aircraft all being given names that started with the letter \"V\".<ref>Downey 1985, p. 5.</ref> Vickers' submission had initially been rejected as not being as advanced as the Victor and the Vulcan,<ref name = 'Rose 52'>Rosemeyer 2009, p. 52.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 72\"/> but Vickers' chief designer [[George Edwards (aviation)|George Edwards]] lobbied the Air Ministry on the basis that it would be available much sooner than the competition, going so far as to promise that a flight-capable prototype would be flown by the end of 1951, that subsequent production aircraft would be flown prior to the end of 1953, and that serial deliveries would commence during early 1955. Gunston and Gilchrist observe that measures offered by Edwards were a \"gigantic risk\", and that gaining the bomber contract has been deemed of crucial importance to the future of aircraft manufacturing at Vickers.<ref name = \"bomber 73\"/>

Although developing and operating three overlapping large aircraft in response to a single Operational Requirement (OR) was wasteful and very costly, events such as the [[Berlin Blockade]] had led to officials placing a sense of urgency in the necessity to provide an effective deterrent to the Soviet Union from acts of aggression in Europe.<ref>Rosemeyer 2009, pp. 52–53.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 72\"/> In April 1948, the [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] issued a specification with the designation B.9/48 written around the Vickers design, which was given the company designation of Type 660; an 'Instruction to Proceed' was received by Vickers on 16 April 1948.<ref name = \"bomber 73\"/> In February 1949, two prototypes of the aircraft were ordered. The first of these was to be fitted with four [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] [[Rolls-Royce Avon|RA.3 Avon]] [[turbojet]] engines, while the second was to be fitted with four [[Armstrong Siddeley]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire|Sapphire]] engines as the Type 667.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p438\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 438.</ref>

===Prototypes===
[[File:Vickers Valiant Farnborough 1951.jpg|thumb|First prototype performing a flight display at [[Farnborough Airshow]], 1951]]
On 18 May 1951, the first prototype, [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial number]] WB210 took to the air for its [[maiden flight]],<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p439\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 439.</ref> within the deadline that George Edwards had promised, and preceding the first [[Short Sperrin]] into the air by several months, it being only 27 months since the contract had been issued. The pilot was [[Joseph Summers|Captain Joseph \"Mutt\" Summers]], who had also been the original test pilot on the [[Supermarine Spitfire]], and wanted to add another \"first\" to his record before he retired.

On 11 January 1952, the first Valiant prototype was lost while making internal noise measurements for the V.1000 programme. Testing included engine shutdowns and re-lights,<ref>The Vickers Valiant, C F Andrews, Profile Publications Ltd., P O Box 26, Leatherhead, p.4</ref> one of which caused a fire in the starboard wing; most of the crew managed to escape the aircraft safely, except for the co-pilot, who struck the tail after ejecting.<ref name=\"Flight p13\">''Flight'' 4 July 1958, p. 13.</ref><ref>Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 11–16.</ref>  After modifications to the fuel system the second prototype, serial number WB215, the Vickers Type 667, conducted its maiden flight on 11 April 1952.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p440\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 440.</ref> It was fitted with more powerful RA.7 Avon engines with {{convert|7500|lbf|kN}} thrust each, rather than the Sapphires that had been originally planned; it also featured more rounded [[Components of jet engines#Air intakes|air inlet]]s, replacing the narrow slot-type intakes of the first prototype, in order to feed sufficient air to the more powerful engines. The short delay until the second prototype became available for testing, which was accelerated by three months, meant that loss of the initial prototype did not seriously compromise the schedule.<ref name=\"Turpin p74\">Turpin 2002, p. 74.</ref><ref name=\"Jones p34\">Jones 2007, p. 34.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 17\"/>

Of the three prototypes, two were representative of the Valiant B.1,<ref name=\"Jones p26\">Jones 2007, p. 26.</ref> while one was built as a further developed version, referred to as the Valiant B.2. The B.2 variant was intended to serve as a [[Pathfinder (RAF)|Pathfinder]] aircraft, flying at high speed at low level to mark targets for the main bomber force. To cope with the rougher ride compared with high altitude operations, the B.2 had a strengthened airframe. In particular, the wing received design alterations to strengthen it, a key change being the removal of the large cut-outs in the wing structure into which the main wheels retracted, allowing the wing torsion box structure to be uninterrupted and giving more room for internal fuel storage; instead the main landing gear, which had four wheels instead of the two large wheels of the B.1, retracted backwards into large [[Aircraft fairing|fairing]]s set into the rear of the wings.<ref name = \"bomber 77 78\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 77–78.</ref> The B.2 had a lengthened fuselage with a total length of {{convert|112|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}}, in contrast to a length of {{convert|108|ft|3|in|abbr=on}} for the Valiant B.1, with the extra length giving room for more avionics.<ref name=\"Jones p32,6\">Jones 2007, pp. 32, 36.</ref>

The prototype B.2, serial number WJ954 first flew on 4 September 1953.<ref name=\"AndrewsVickers p445\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 445.</ref> Finished in a gloss black night operations paint scheme, it became known as the \"Black Bomber\". Its performance at low level was superior to that of the B.1 (or any other V-bomber), being strong enough to fly at full power at [[sea level#Aviation|sea level]],<ref name = \"bomber 77\"/> with the aircraft being cleared for {{convert|580|mph|abbr=on}} at low level (with speeds of up to {{convert|640|mph|abbr=on}} being reached in testing). This was compared to the B.1's sea-level limit of {{convert|414|mph|abbr=on|round=5}}. The Air Ministry ordered 17 production B.2s, which were to be powered by [[Rolls-Royce Conway]] [[turbofan]]s. Although the Valiant B.2's low-level capabilities later proved to be highly desirable, the B.2 program was abandoned as the RAF considered that the Pathfinder concept, born in a time of mass raids, was obsolete in the nuclear era.<ref name = \"bomber 78\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 78.</ref> The B.2 prototype was used for tests for a few years, including testing use of rockets to boost takeoff, contributing to improvements for the Valiant B.1, before being scrapped in 1958.<ref name=\"Jones p36-7\">Jones 2007, pp. 36–37.</ref><ref name=\"Osprey p83-4\">Brookes 2012, pp. 83–84.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 20\"/>

===Production===
[[File:Vickers Valian B.1 WZ393 90 Sqn SGT 10.06.57.jpg|thumb|Valiant B(PR)K.1 WZ393 of 90 Squadron in original all-metal finish displaying at Blackpool Squires Gate airport in 1957]]
In April 1951, an initial production order for 25 Valiant B.1 (Bomber Mark 1) aircraft was placed by the Ministry of Supply on behalf of the RAF.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p400\">Burnet and Morgan ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1980, p. 400.</ref> The timing of this order was key to establishing production quickly. Due to shortages of [[steel]] and other materials while setting up an assembly line at Brooklands, substantial portions of the production [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] for the Valiant were made from [[concrete]].<ref name = \"bomber 77\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 77.</ref> The first five Valiants produced were completed to a pre-production standard, the first being WP199. On 21 December 1953, the production aircraft conducted its first flight; this had again occurred within the schedule that Edwards had promised.<ref name=\"Jones p37\">Jones 2007, p. 37.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 77\"/>

On 8 February 1955, this first production Valiant was delivered to the RAF.<ref name=\"Osprey p12\">Brookes 2012, p. 12.</ref><ref name = \"flint 131\">Flintham 2008, p. 131.</ref> Britain's \"V-bomber\" force, as it had been nicknamed in October 1952, formally entered operational service on that day. The Victor and Vulcan would soon follow the Valiant into service, for a total of three types of nuclear-armed strategic bombers in RAF service. In September 1957, the final Valiant was delivered.<ref name = \"hub and sim 26\"/> According to Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, all production aircraft had been delivered on time and below budget.<ref name = \"bomber 78\"/>

A total of 108 Valiants were manufactured, including the sole B.2 prototype. In addition to its principal role as the RAF's delivery platform for Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]], the Valiant bomber also dropped high explosive bombs. The bombers were followed into service by a strategic reconnaissance version and a multi-purpose version capable conventional bombing, [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[aerial refueling|aerial refuelling]]. One squadron operated 6 Valiants with [[electronic countermeasure]]s equipment.<ref name = \"black wright 19 20\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 19–20.</ref>  Valiants of 90 and 214 squadrons were used for air refuelling through the addition of a Hose Drum Unit (HDU) in the bomb bay, mounted on the same suspension units that were also used for bombs.  This meant that for refuelling, the bomb-bay doors had to be opened so that the refuelling hose could be streamed (unlike later tankers where the HDU was flush with the under fuselage rather than inside a bomb bay).  Several Valiants were also used for testing and development purposes, such as its use as a flying testbed during trials of the [[Blue Steel (missile)|Blue Steel]] nuclear-armed [[standoff missile]], which was later added to the arsenal of munitions the other V-bombers were equipped with.<ref name = \"black wright 24 26\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 24–26.</ref><ref name = \"flint 133\">Flintham 2008, p. 133.</ref>

Unlike its Vulcan and Victor peers, the Valiant did not see the production of a refined and more capable B.2 model.<ref name = \"flint 131\"/> Instead, the Valiant B.1 fleet was later switched to a low-level flight profile, after which [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] due to the resulting increased turbulence was discovered and ultimately led to the type's premature retirement. Vic Flintham observed that: \"There is a fine irony to the situation, for Vickers had produced the Type 673 B Mk 2 version designed as a fast, low-level pathfinder... The Air Ministry was not interested...\"<ref name = \"flint 133\"/> The Valiant was Vickers' last purpose-built military aircraft. It was followed by the [[Vickers Vanguard|Vanguard]], a passenger turboprop designed in 1959, and the [[Vickers VC10]], a jet passenger aircraft in 1962, also used as a military transport and tanker by the RAF.<ref name = \"flint 131\"/>

==Design==
[[File:Vickers Valiant (27363801724).jpg|thumb|Forward view of preserved Vickers Valiant XD818 at [[RAF Museum Cosford]] ]]
The Valiant was a conservative design of the era, having a shoulder-mounted wing and four [[Rolls-Royce Avon|Rolls-Royce Avon RA.3]] [[turbojet]] engines, each providing up to {{convert|6500|lbf|kN}} of thrust, installed in pairs in [[fireproof]] bays in each wing root.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> The design of the Valiant gave an overall impression of a plain and clean aircraft with simple aerodynamics. George Edwards described the Valiant appropriately and simply as an \"unfunny\" aircraft.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p449\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 449.</ref> The root chord thickness ratio was 12% and allowed the Avon engines to be within the wing rather than on pods as in the contemporary [[B-47 Stratojet|Boeing B-47]].<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p442\">Andrews and Morgan, p. 442.</ref> This \"buried engine\" installation contributed to the aircraft's aerodynamic cleanness, and was British practice at the time. It made engine access for maintenance and repair difficult and increased the risk that an uncontained failure of one engine would cause damage to the adjacent engine; it also increased the complexity of the design of the main spar which had to be routed around the engines.<ref name = \"bomber 73 74\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 73–74.</ref>

The wing of the Valiant used a \"compound sweep\" configuration, devised by Vickers [[aerodynamics|aerodynamicist]] Elfyn Richards.<ref name=\"Barfield p158\">Barfield ''Air International'' September 1992, p. 158.</ref> Richards found that it would be advantageous to increase the sweep on the inboard section of the wing, a discovery which he later [[patent]]ed; the Valiant's wing made use of a 37° angle of sweepback for the inner third of the wing, which reduced to an angle of about 21° at the tips.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p398\">Burnet and Morgan  ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1980, p. 398.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 74\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 74.</ref> This was because the thickness/chord ratio could be reduced closer to the tips, balancing this against the sweep reduction in postponement of supersonic airflow effects such as buffeting and increased drag.<ref name=\"Barfield p158\"/> The choice to have mild sweepback around the aerodynamic control surfaces meant that in-service speeds were limited to Mach 0.84 and a typical cruise of Mach 0.75 at heights up to {{convert|55000|ft}} when lightly loaded.<ref name=\"Profile p16\">Andrews 1966, p. 16.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 17 18\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 17–18.</ref> A [[drogue parachute]] was deemed unnecessary even operating from runways as short as {{Convert|6000|ft}}.<ref name = \"bomber 77\"/>

The wing was mounted high on the aircraft's fuselage and this created a limited fuel capacity when combined with the other necessary compromises in design such as the placement of the engines and main [[landing gear]] within the wing's internal space.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> The [[leading edge]] of the wing was fixed while the [[trailing edge]] incorporated large outboard two-section [[aileron]]s, the inner section featuring [[trim tab]]s, alongside double-slotted [[Flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s again split into inboard and outboard sections.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 75–76.</ref> Direct [[electric motor|electrical drive]]s were used to move the flaps and other, usually hydraulically-operated, equipment on the aircraft.<ref name = \"bomber 76\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 76.</ref>

[[File:Valiant 2 (3446560911).jpg|thumb|left|The wing root and air intakes]]
Production aircraft were powered by four Avon 201 turbojet engines, with {{convert|9500|lbf|kN}} thrust. In addition to providing thrust for flight, the engines also provided [[bleed air]] for the [[pressurization]], [[ice protection system|ice protection]], and [[air conditioning]] systems. The aircraft's electrical [[Electric generator|generator]]s were also driven by the engines.<ref name = \"bomber 76\"/> [[Napier & Son|Napier Spraymat]] [[electric heating|electric heaters]] were installed in the engine inlets to prevent engine damage due to ice forming on the duct surfaces and then shedding into the compressors. The shape of the engine inlets were long rectangular slots in the first prototype, while the production Valiants had oval or \"spectacle\" shaped inlets designed to pass greater airflow for the more powerful engines that were installed.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p442\"/> The jet exhausts emerged from fairings above the trailing edge of the wings.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p442\"/>

For required takeoff performance from short tropical dispersal bases,<ref>Bombers of the West, Bill Gunston 1973, {{|ISBN 684 13623 6}}, p.50</ref> a [[jettison (aviation)|jettisonable]] [[RATO|rocket booster engine]]s pack was developed for the Valiant.<ref name = \"bomber 78\"/> Trials were performed with two underwing [[de Havilland Sprite]] boosters; these were ultimately deemed unnecessary when more powerful variants of the Avon engine became available. Also, there was an increased risk of accidents if one booster rocket failed on takeoff, resulting in asymmetric thrust.<ref name = \"black wright 20\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 20.</ref> Some Valiant engines had [[water injection (engines)|water injection]], which increased takeoff thrust by about {{convert|1000|lb|kg}} per engine.<ref name = \"darling 41\">Darling 2012, p. 41.</ref>

The crew of the Valiant were contained in a pressurized compartment in the forward area of the aircraft and consisted of a pilot, co-pilot, two navigators, and air signaller (later called an air electronics officer);<ref name = \"black wright 28\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 28.</ref> the manufacturing of this pressurized section was subcontracted to [[Saunders-Roe]]. The pilot and co-pilot were located on an upper level in a side-by-side arrangement, the remaining three crewmen sat at stations set lower in the cockpit to the rear.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 74–75.</ref> A crew of five had been enabled by the discontinuation of defensive [[gun turret]]s and accompanying [[air gunner]]s, a design philosophy proved by the successful [[De Havilland Mosquito]] bomber of World War II.<ref name = \"bomber 74\"/>{{#tag:ref|Vickers had proposed the installation of a pair of 20 mm [[revolver cannon|cannon]]s in the tailcone; this concept was never explored beyond the drawing board.<ref name = \"bomber 78\"/>|group=N}} The pilot and copilot were provided with [[Martin-Baker]] [[Martin-Baker Mk.3|Mk.3]] [[ejector seat]]s, while the rear crewmen were expected to bail out of the oval main entrance door.<ref name=\"Turpin p79-0\">Turpin 2002, pp. 79–80.</ref> It has been claimed that the survivability of the rear crewmen was substantially reduced due to the ineffectiveness of this method of escape.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/>

[[File:Vickers Valiant B1 (3873562557).jpg|thumb|The crewmen's entry door on the side of the forward fuselage]]
The fuselage area behind the pressurised crew section and forward of the wing was used to house much of the Valiant's [[avionics]], [[air conditioning]], and the retractable main [[landing gear]].<ref name = \"bomber 75\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 75.</ref> The Valiant featured a [[tricycle landing gear]] arrangement, with twin-wheel nosegear and [[tandem]]-wheel main gear that retracted outwards recessed set into the wing. Each of the main gears were equipped with multipad [[anti-lock braking system|anti-skid]] [[disc brake]]s, and were [[telescoping (mechanics)|telescopic]]ally linked so that a single drive motor could pull them up into the wing recesses.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> Most of the aircraft's systems were electrically powered, including the [[Flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s and [[landing gear|undercarriage]].<ref name = \"darling 39\">Darling 2012, p. 39.</ref> The brakes and steering gear were [[hydraulics|hydraulic]]ally powered, the pumps themselves were electrically driven.<ref name=\"Flight p19\"/><ref name = \"black wright 18\"/> The lower half of the aircraft's nose contained the scanner of a powerful [[H2S (radar)|H2S]] [[radar]] in a large [[glass fiber]] [[radome]]; in addition, a visual [[bomb sight]] was set beneath the lower floor of the pressurised section.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> The avionics bay could be accessed via an entrance at the base of the rear fuselage leading to an internal [[catwalk]] above the aft of the [[bomb bay]].<ref name = \"bomber 76 77\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 76–77.</ref>

The electrics were powered by 112 volt [[direct current]] generators for functions requiring large amounts of electrical power, and a 28 V DC system provided a controlling voltage for other systems and the actuators that initiated the higher-voltage system functions. Backup batteries were a bank of 24 V units and 96 V batteries. 115 V [[alternating current]] was provided to systems such as radio and radar that required it; the [[actuator]]s for the flight surfaces, flaps, [[Air brake (aeronautics)|air brake]]s and undercarriage were also powered via this facility.<ref name=\"Flight p19\">''Flight'' 4 July 1958, p. 19.</ref><ref name=\"Turpin p78\">Turpin 2002, p. 78.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 18\"/> It was decided during development that as much of the aircraft would be electrically-driven as was possible; this design choice was due to electrical cabling being lighter than its hydraulic equivalent, and the already-present high power electrical generators to meet requirements of energy-hungry equipment such as the radar.<ref name = \"bomber 76\"/>

The [[aircraft flight control system|flight control]]s of the Valiant consisted of two channels of power control with full manual backup; flying in manual was allowed but limited, being intended to be used only in the event of complete electrical failure.<ref name=\"Flight p19\"/> The flight controls reportedly required considerable effort to manually operate.<ref name = \"black wright 18\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 18.</ref> All three axes of the flight controls featured a dynamic [[Aircraft flight control system#Artificial feel devices|artificial feel]] system, the pressure for which was provided via a [[ram-air intake|ram-air inlet]].<ref name = \"bomber 76\"/> A [[GE Aviation Systems|Smith Aerospace]] [[autopilot]] and [[instrument landing system]] (ILS) functionality was installed along with various [[navigational aid]]s, such as the [[Marconi Company]]-built [[Green Satin radar|Green Satin]] [[doppler radar]], [[Gee (navigation)|Gee]] [[radio navigation]], [[Non-directional beacon|Automatic Direction Finder]] (ADF), [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]]/[[distance measuring equipment|Distance Measuring Equipment]] (DME), and [[radar altimeter]]s.<ref name = \"bomber 77\"/> Provisions for additional equipment and sensors, such as [[side looking airborne radar]], were also made.<ref name = \"bomber 77\"/>

[[File:Handley Page K2 (10024223034).jpg|thumb|left|Landing gear and wing]]
The main centre fuselage of the Valiant was highly strengthened around a massive backbone beam to appropriately support the weight and stresses of the two widely-set [[Spar (aeronautics)|wing spar]]s and five protected [[fuel cell]]s located in the upper portions of this section, the sizable [[bomb bay]] was also in the lower half of the centre fuselage.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/><ref name=\"Flight p18\">''Flight'' 4 July 1958, p. 18.</ref> The aft fuselage used a [[monocoque|semi-monocoque]] structure, being far lighter than the centre fuselage; the [[Boulton Paul Aircraft|Boulton-Paul]]-produced electro-hydraulic power units for the ailerons, [[elevator (aeronautics)|elevator]]s, and [[rudder]] were contained within this space.<ref name = \"bomber 76\"/> The tail, which was attached to the rear fuselage was of a simple design, being [[Cone|tapered]] rather than swept back,<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> the [[horizontal stabilizer|horizontal tailplane]] was mounted well up the [[vertical stabilizer|vertical fin]] to keep it clear of the engines' exhaust.<ref name=\"Barfield p158\"/> The tailcone contained a [[tail warning radar]].<ref name = \"bomber 78\"/>

The main structural components, spars and beams of the Valiant had been constructed from a zinc/magnesium/copper aluminium alloy designated as DTD683 in the UK, which later proved problematic.<ref>''Flight'' 14 December 1951, p. 756.</ref><ref>''Flight'' 17 July 1953, p. 91.</ref> The Valiant had been designed with a '[[Safe-life design|Safe-Life]]' strategy;<ref>Brookes Valiant Units of the Cold War, pp. 83.</ref> this combination of 'Safe-Life' and DTD683 came to be viewed as a severe mistake. In 1956, a publication within the Journal of the Institute of Metals<ref>''The Journal of the Institute of Metals'' (JIM), Vol. 86, No. 1790, 1957–1958.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Structural Changes Caused by Plastic Strain and by fatigue in Aluminium-Zinc-Magnesium-Copper Alloys Corresponding to DTD.683 (Broom and Mezza)|group=N}} condemned the material DTD683 as being unstable and capable of catastrophic failure when stressing the airframe close to its design limits.  The \"Safe-Life\" design strategy was dismissed by a Lockheed engineer in a talk given to the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] in 1956, because it did not guarantee safety from catastrophic failure.<ref>''Flight'' 6 April 1956, p. 394.</ref>

The Valiant B.1 could carry a single {{convert|10,000|lb|kg}} [[nuclear weapon]] or up to 21 {{convert|1,000|lb|kg}} conventional [[bomb]]s in its bomb bay. The Valiant had been designed not only to accommodate the early [[Nuclear fission|fission]]-based nuclear weapons, but also the newer and larger [[thermonuclear]] [[hydrogen bomb]]s.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> A \"clean\" Valiant (one without underwing tanks) could climb straight to 50,000&nbsp;ft after takeoff unless it had heavy stores in the large bomb bay.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In the [[aerial reconnaissance]] role, a camera crate would be installed in the bomb bay, along with a pair of cameras set into the fuselage and larger rear fuel tanks to extend the aircraft's endurance.<ref name = \"black wright 19\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 19.</ref> Large external fuel tanks under each wing with a capacity of {{convert|1,650|Impgal|l}}, could be used to extend range; an auxiliary fuel tank could also be installed in the forward area of the bomb bay; the external wing tanks were fitted as standard on Valiants that were operated as [[aerial refueling|aerial refuelling]] tankers.<ref name = \"black wright 19\"/> For receiving fuel, a fixed [[aerial refueling#Probe-and-drogue 2|refuelling probe]] was fitted onto the aircraft's nose, this was connected to the fuel tanks via a pipe running along the outside of the canopy to avoid penetrating the pressure cabin.<ref name = \"bomber 79\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 79.</ref>

==Operational history==

===Nuclear deterrent===
[[File:YellowSunBomb2.JPG|thumb|right|Side view of a [[Yellow Sun (nuclear weapon)|Yellow Sun]] nuclear bomb under the wing of Vickers Valiant XD818 at the [[RAF Cosford]] museum]]

The first squadron to be equipped with the Valiant was [[No. 138 Squadron RAF|138 Squadron]], which formed at [[RAF Gaydon]] on 1 January 1955, with 232 Operational Conversion Unit forming at Gaydon on 21 February 1955 to convert crews to the new bomber.<ref name = \"darling 40\"/> Since the Valiant was part of an entirely new class of bombers for the RAF, the crews for the new type were selected from experienced aircrew, with first pilots requiring 1,750 flying hours as an aircraft captain, with at least one tour flying the Canberra, with second pilots needing 700 hours in command and the remaining three crewmembers had to be recommended for posting to the Valiant by their commanding officers.<ref name=\"Jones p79-2\">Jones 2007, pp. 79–82.</ref> Valiants were originally assigned to the strategic nuclear bombing role, as were the Vulcan and Victor B.1s when they became operational. At its peak, the Valiant equipped ten RAF squadrons.<ref name=\"Osprey p92\"/><ref>Wynn, pp. 564-565.</ref>

According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the Valiant had performed \"extremely well\" during bombing competition hosted by American [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC).<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/> American interest in the Valiant resulted in a visit to Vickers by USAF generals [[Hoyt Vandenberg|Vandenberg]], Johnson and [[Curtis LeMay|LeMay]]. Vickers test-pilot Brian Trubshaw believed that George Edwards was put under some pressure to build the Boeing B-47 under license. The only result from the visit was Le May's insistence that the Valiant pilot side-by-side seating be incorporated in the B-52 instead of the tandem arrangement in the B-47 and prototype B-52.<ref>Brian Trubshaw Test Pilot, Brian Trubshaw and Sally Edmondson, Sutton Publishing Limited 1999, {{ISBN|0 7509 1838 1}}, p.35</ref>

On 11 October 1956, a Valiant B.1 (WZ366) of No 49 Squadron was the first RAF aircraft to drop a British operational atomic bomb when it performed a test drop of a down-rated [[Blue Danube bomb|Blue Danube]] weapon on [[Maralinga]], [[South Australia]].<ref name=\"Mason Bomber p378\">Mason 1994, p. 378.</ref> Windscreen blinds were fitted in advance of the test to protect the crew from the intense flash of light from the nuclear detonation. Following the landing of the aircraft after deploying the weapon, WZ366 was assessed for potential damage and for [[radioactive contamination]].<ref>Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 33–36.</ref>

On 15 May 1957, a Valiant B(K).1 (XD818) dropped the first British [[hydrogen bomb]], the Short Granite, over the Pacific as part of [[Operation Grapple]].<ref name=\"RAF\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/documents/collections/1994-1352-A-Valiant-XD818.pdf|title=Individual History Vickers Valiant B (K) Mk.I XD818/7894M Museum Accession Number 1994/1352/A |publisher=Royal Air Force Museum |accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> No 49 Squadron was selected to perform the live weapon drop, and were equipped with specially-modified Valiants to conform with the scientific requirements of the tests and other precautionary measures to protect against heat and radiation.<ref>Hubbard and Simmons 2008, pp. 61, 68.</ref> The test was largely a failure, as the measured yield was less than a third of the maximum expected and while achieving the desired [[thermonuclear]] explosion the device had failed to operate as intended. The first British hydrogen bomb that detonated as planned was dropped in the Grapple X test on 8 November 1957.<ref name = \"hub and sim 157\">Hubbard and Simmons 2008, p. 157.</ref> The Grapple series of tests continued into 1958, and in April 1958 the Grapple Y bomb exploded with ten times the yield of the original \"Short Granite\".<ref name = \"hub and sim 167\">Hubbard and Simmons 2008, p. 167.</ref> Testing was finally terminated in November 1958, when the British government decided it would perform no more air-delivered nuclear tests.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/>

Originally the bombing role was to have been carried out at high altitude, but following the shooting down in 1960 of the [[Lockheed U-2]] flown by Gary Powers by an early Soviet [[SA-2]] Guideline missile, the SAM threat caused the V-force to train for low-level attack as a means of avoiding radar detection when flying within hostile airspace. They were repainted in grey/green camouflage with normal markings, replacing their [[anti-flash white]] scheme.<ref name = \"flint 133\"/> By 1963, four Valiant squadrons (49, 148, 207 and 214) had been assigned to [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SACEUR]] in the low-level tactical bombing role.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/> By this point, there had been a noticeable decline in flying rates for the type.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/>

===Conventional warfare===
[[File:vickers valiant camouflaged on ground arp.jpg|thumb|Camouflaged Valiant at [[Bristol Filton Airport|Filton]], [[England]]. Circa mid-1960s]]
Peacetime practice involved the dropping of small practice bombs on instrumented bombing ranges, and a system of predicted bombing using radio tones to mark the position of the bomb drop over non-range targets, the bomb error being calculated by a ground radar unit and passed either to the crew during flight or to a headquarters for analysis. Use of the Valiant's Navigational and Bombing System (NBS) and the high quality of assigned crews, who were typically veterans and often had been previously decorated for wartime service, meant a high level of bombing accuracy could be achieved, greater than that of aircraft during the Second World War. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, Valiant crews were able to place practice bombs from an altitude of {{convert|45,000|ft}} within a few meters of their assigned target.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/>

The Valiant was the first of the V-bombers to see combat, during the Anglo-French-Israeli Suez intervention in October and November 1956. During [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]], the British military operation in what became known as the [[Suez Crisis]], Valiants operating from the airfield at Luqa on Malta repeatedly dropped conventional bombs on targets inside Egypt. Egyptian military airfields were the principal target of these bombing raids; other targets included communications such as [[radio station]]s and transport hubs.<ref>Bowman 2016, p. 158</ref> On the first night of the operation, six Valiants were dispatched to bomb [[Cairo West Air Base]] (which was aborted in flight due to potential risk to US personnel in the vicinity) while six more attacked [[Almaza Air Base]] and a further five bombed [[Kibrit Air Base]] and Huckstep Barracks.<ref name = \"black wright 42\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 42.</ref><ref name = \"darling 42\">Darling 2012, p. 42.</ref>

Although the Egyptians did not oppose the attacks and there were no Valiant combat losses incurred, the results of the raids were reportedly disappointing. Although the Valiants dropped a total of {{convert|842|LT}} of bombs, only three of the seven airfields attacked were seriously damaged.{{#tag:ref|The Valiants had not yet been fitted with their operational Navigational and Bombing System (NBS) and were dropping using Second World War techniques.|group=N}} The Egyptian Air Force had been effectively destroyed in a wider series of multinational attacks of which the Valiant bombing missions had been a part.<ref>Bowman 2016, pp. 158, 161.</ref> It was the last time the V-bombers flew a live combat mission until Avro Vulcans bombed Port Stanley airfield in the Falkland Islands during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.<ref>McClelland, pp.175–178.</ref>

===Tanker operations===
Valiant tankers were flown by No. 214 Squadron at [[RAF Marham]], operational in 1958, and No. 90 Squadron at Honington, operational in 1959.<ref name = \"hub and sim 26\"/> The two lost their bomber role and became full-time tanker squadrons on 1 April 1962.<ref>Brookes 1982, p. 142</ref> Aircraft assigned to the tanker role were fitted with a Hose Drum Unit (HDU or \"HooDoo\") in the bomb bay. The HDU was mounted on bomb-mounting points and could be removed if necessary; this arrangement meant that the bomb bay doors had to be opened in order to give fuel to a receiver aircraft. A control panel at the radar navigator station in the cockpit was used to operate the HDU.  All of the HDU equipment was designed to be easily removable so that the aircraft could be reverted to the bomber role.<ref>Tanner 2006, pp. 113–114.</ref>

With in-flight refuelling probes fitted to Valiants, Vulcans and Victors and Valiant tankers available to give fuel and extend the range of the aircraft being refuelled, the RAF Medium Bomber Force could go beyond \"medium range\", and the RAF had a long range capability. Long-range demonstration flights were made using Valiant tankers pre-deployed along the route. In 1960, a Valiant bomber flew non-stop from Marham in the UK to Singapore and in 1961 a Vulcan flew non-stop from the UK to Australia.<ref name = \"hub and sim 26\">Hubbard and Simmons 2008, p. 26.</ref> The two tanker squadrons regularly practised long range missions, refuelled by other Valiant tankers on the way. These included non-stop flights from the UK to [[Nairobi]], [[Singapore]] and [[Sydney]].<ref>Brookes 1982, pp. 141–142</ref> In 1963 a squadron of [[Gloster Javelin]] fighters was refuelled by tankers and flew in stages from the UK to India (Exercise \"Shiksha\") to support the Indian Air Force in a dispute over their border with China.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pprune.org/aviation-history-nostalgia/525734-javelins-kalaikunda.html |title=Javelins at Kalaikunda |website=pprune.org |access-date=19 May 2018}}</ref> Other aircraft refuelled by Valiants at this time included Victor and Vulcan bombers, [[English Electric Lightning]] fighters, and [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]] and [[Supermarine Scimitar]] fighters of the Royal Navy.<ref>Wynn 1994, p. 168.</ref>

===Countermeasures and reconnaissance roles===
Valiants of [[No. 18 Squadron RAF]] at [[RAF Finningley]] were modified to the \"radio countermeasures\" (RCM) role—now called \"[[Electronic warfare support measures|electronic countermeasures]]\" (ECM). These aircraft were ultimately fitted with American APT-16A and ALT-7 jamming transmitters, Airborne Cigar and Carpet [[Radar jamming and deception|jammers]], APR-4 and APR-9 \"sniffing\" receivers, and [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]] dispensers. At least seven Valiants were configured to the RCM role.<ref>Brookes 2012, pp. 45–46.</ref><ref>[http://radionerds.com/images/a/af/JAM-EQP_HTM.txt]</ref>

Valiants of No. 543 Squadron at [[RAF Wyton]] were modified to serve in the photographic reconnaissance role. In one notable operation in 1965, Valiants of No. 543 Squadron photographed around {{convert|400000|sqmi}} of [[Rhodesia]] across an 11-week period.<ref name = \"hub and sim 26\"/>

===Fatigue failures and retirement===
In 1956, Vickers had performed a series of low level tests in WZ383 to assess the type for low level flight at high speed. Several modifications to the aircraft were made, including a metal radome, debris guards on the two inboard engines, and after six flights the aileron and elevator artificial feel was reduced by 50%. Pilots reported problems with cabin heating and condensation that would need remedying. The aircraft was fitted with data recording equipment and these data were used by Vickers to estimate the remaining safe life of the type under these flying conditions. Initially a safe life of 75 hours was recommended, which became \"the real figure might be less than 200 hours\".<ref>Morgan p. 66-68</ref> The number of hours flown by each Valiant in a year was an operational issue for the RAF.<ref>Valiant Units of the Cold War, Brookes p. 88.</ref>

[[File:15 Vickers Valiant WZ397 (15216077444).jpg|thumb|left|Vickers Valiant on display]]
Later the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]] ran a similar series of tests that more closely resembled actual operational conditions including low level and taxiing; the corresponding report published in 1958 produced data that could be used to get a better grasp on which flight conditions produced the most damage, and enable a better projection of the future life span for the type.<ref>[http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/cp/0521.pdf \"Fatigue Loadings in Flight-Loads in the Nose Undercarriage and Wing of a Valiant.\"] E.W. Wells, ARC C.P. No. 521.</ref>

In May 1957 ''Flight'' reported an \"incident at Boscombe Down, when a Valiant cracked a rear spar member after a rocket-assisted takeoff in overload conditions\"<ref>''Flight'' 17 May 1957, p. 651</ref> This aircraft was the second prototype WB 215; it was subsequently broken up for wing fatigue testing after it had flown 489 hours.<ref>Morgan p. 44 & p. 89.</ref> In July 1964, a cracked spar was found in one of the three Valiants (either WZ394 – Wynne, or WZ389 – Morgan) on Operation Pontifex.<ref>Wynn p. 469.</ref> This was followed on 6 August by a failure of the starboard wing rear spar at 30,000&nbsp;ft,<ref>Brookes, Victor Units of the Cold War, p. 67.</ref> in WP217, an OCU aircraft from Gaydon captained by Flight Lieutenant \"Taffy\" Foreman. The aircraft landed back at Gaydon but without flap deployment because damage to the starboard rear spar caused the flap rollers to come out of their guides so that the flap would not lower on that side. Later inspection of the aircraft also showed the fuselage skin below the starboard inner plane had buckled, popping the rivets; the engine door had cracked and the rivets had been pulled and the skin buckled on the top surface of the mainplane between the two engines.<ref name = \"darling 39 40\">Darling 2012, pp. 39–40.</ref> Both of these aircraft were PR variants.<ref>Morgan, App 2, Individual Valiant Histories pp. 89–94.</ref>

Inspections of the entire fleet showed that the wing spars were suffering from fatigue at between 35% and 75% of the assessed safe fatigue life, probably due to low level turbulence.<ref name = \"darling 40\">Darling 2012, p. 40.</ref> After this inspection, the aircraft were divided into three categories, Cat A aircraft continuing to fly, Cat B to fly to a repair base, and Cat C requiring repair before flying again. The tanker squadrons had the highest proportion of Cat A aircraft because their role had been mainly at high level.<ref name = \"darling 40\"/> This also caused the methods of assessing fatigue lives to be reviewed.<ref>Wynn 1996, p. 465.</ref> By the time the type was scrapped, only about 50 aircraft were still in service; the rest had been slowly accumulating at various RAF Maintenance Units designated as \"Non effective Aircraft\".<ref>Morgan App2, pp. 89–94.</ref>

Initially there was no question of retiring the type, or even a majority of affected aircraft. Repairs were actively taking place at Valiant bases such as Marham using working parties from Vickers plus RAF technicians from the base.  In January 1965, the Wilson government with [[Denis Healey]] as [[Secretary of State for Defence]] decided that the expense of the repairs could not be justified, given the short operational life left to the Valiant, and the fleet was permanently grounded as of 26 January 1965.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wGNAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nKMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5895,4007485&dq=vickers+valiant&hl=en \"Valiants to be Scrapped.\"] ''Glasgow Herald'', 27 January 1965.</ref> The QRA alert that had been in place for [[SACEUR]] was maintained until the final grounding and was then allowed to lapse.<ref>Wynn 1996, pp. 464–471, 500.</ref> When asked to make a statement regarding the Valiant's scrapping in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Denis Healey stated that it \"was not in any way connected with low-level flying\" and that the \"last Government took the decision to continue operating the Valiant force for another four years after its planned fatigue life was complete\".<ref>{{cite |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1965/feb/01/royal-air-force-valiant-aircraft#column_725|title=ROYAL AIR FORCE (VALIANT AIRCRAFT) |work=House of Commons Debates |date=1 February 1965 |volume=vol 705||at=cc723-7}}</ref>

Aviation author Barry Jones commented in his book that: \"A question has to be asked. For two years before the demise of the Valiant, Handley Page at Radlett had 100 [[Handley Page Hastings|Hastings]] go through their shops. They were completely dismantled and rebuilt, having DTD683 components removed and replaced by new alloy sections. What was so special about the Hastings and why was the Valiant not treated similarly? Perhaps we will know one day – but I doubt it.\" <ref>\"V-Bombers” Barry Jones p. 117.</ref> A ''Flight'' report about the scrapping states \"Fatigue affected all Valiants ... not only those that had been used for some low flying\".<ref>{{cite |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1965/1965%20-%200310.html|title=End of the Valiants|work=Flight International |date=4 February 1965 |page=184}}</ref>

On 9 December 1964, the last Valiant tanker sortie in XD812 of 214 Squadron was refuelling Lightning aircraft over the North Sea and was recalled to land back at Marham before the scheduled exercise was completed. On the same day, the last Valiant bomber sortie was carried out by XD818.{{#tag:ref|XD818 was also the aircraft which had dropped nuclear weapons during [[Operation Grapple]].|group=N}}

==Variants==
Including the three prototypes, a total of 107 Valiants were built.<ref>Brookes 2012, p. 45.</ref><ref name=\"Royal Air Force Museum\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalcoldwarexhibition.org/research/collections/vickers-valiant-b1/ |title=Vickers Valiant B1 |publisher=Royal Air Force Museum  |access-date=19 May 2018 }}</ref>

* '''Type 710 Valiant B(PR).1''': eleven bomber/photo-reconnaissance aircraft. Edwards and his team had considered use of the Valiant for photo-reconnaissance from the start, and this particular type of aircraft could accommodate a removable \"crate\" in the bomb-bay, carrying up to eight narrow-view/high resolution cameras and four survey cameras.<ref name=\"Thunder and Lightnings\" />
* '''Type 733 Valiant B(PR)K.1''': 14 bomber/photo-reconnaissance/tanker aircraft.<ref name=\"Thunder and Lightnings\" />
* '''Type 758 Valiant B(K).1''': 44 bomber / tanker aircraft. Both tanker variants carried a removable tanker system in the bomb bay, featuring fuel tanks and a hose-and-drogue [[aerial refuelling]] system. A further 16 Valiant B(K).1s were ordered, but cancelled.<ref name=\"Thunder and Lightnings\" />
* '''Valiant B.2''': 1 prototype.<ref name=\"Thunder and Lightnings\" />
* Vickers also considered an air transport version of the Valiant, with a low-mounted wing, wingspan increased from {{convert|114|ft|4|in}} to {{convert|140|ft}}, fuselage lengthened to {{convert|146|ft}}, and uprated engines. Work on a prototype, designated the Type 1000, began in early 1953. The prototype was to lead to a military transport version, the Type 1002, and a civilian transport version, the Type 1004 or VC.7. The Type 1000 prototype was almost complete when it, too, was cancelled.<ref name=\"Thunder and Lightnings\" />
Valiant production ended in August 1957.<ref name=\"Royal Air Force Museum\" /> An order for 17 B.2 models was cancelled.<ref name=\"Thunder and Lightnings\" />

The ''Vickers Valiant''' is a British high-altitude jet [[bomber]], and was part of the [[Royal Air Force]]'s \"[[V bomber]]\" nuclear weapon equipped strategic deterrent in the 1950s and 1960s. It was developed by [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] in response to [[Air Ministry specification|Specification B.35/46]] issued by the [[Air Ministry]] for a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] jet-powered bomber. The Valiant was the first of the V bombers to become operational, and was followed by the [[Handley Page Victor]] and the [[Avro Vulcan]], which were more advanced. The Valiant has the distinction of being the only V bomber to have dropped live nuclear weapons.<ref name = \"black wright 33\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 33.</ref>

The Valiant was intended as a high-altitude [[strategic bomber]]. During the late 1950s, in response to rapid advances in [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) technology, the Valiant fleet was switched to flying low-level for the strike role. Beyond the [[nuclear deterrence]] role, the Valiant was also used by the RAF for other purposes, as a number were converted to perform support roles such as [[aerial refuelling]] tankers and [[aerial reconnaissance]] aircraft. Valiants were used for conventional bombing missions over [[Egypt]] for [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956.

By late 1964 it was found that all variants of the Valiant showed premature fatigue and inter-crystalline corrosion in wing spar attachment forgings, traced to the use of a poorly understood aluminium alloy, DTD683.<ref>“Pitfalls of the substitution of sophistication for Common Sense”  D Howe, Cranfield University. IMechE Vol 212 Part G, Sec 5.1 Metals, p. 307. May 1998</ref>{{#tag:ref|The rapid development of aircraft during World War II led to a demand for very high strength aluminium alloy, especially for use in highly loaded tension and compression members. One result was a zinc /magnesium based alloy given the identification DTD 683. It was ideal for such applications as wing spar caps providing, as was the case with wartime operations, the life of the aircraft was short. Use in early post-War transport aircraft showed that DTD 683 was very crack-sensitive and hence prone to fatigue failure. In many cases it had to be replaced by steel components. DTD 683 is an example of a material developed to meet a particular need, but whose wider characteristics were not investigated until too late.
D.Howe 1998|group=N}} Rather than proceeding with an expensive rebuilding program, the Ministry of Defence retired the Valiant in 1965. Its duties were continued by the other V-bombers which remained in service until the 1980s.

==Development==
===Background and origins===
In November 1944, the Joint Technical Warfare  Committee, along with a separate committee chaired by Sir [[Henry Tizard]], examined the future potential  of \"weapons of war\" and the accompanying Tizard Report published on 3 July 1945 made specific policy directions for the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]].<ref name=\"Turpin p. 71\">Turpin 2002, p. 71.</ref> After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the policy of using heavy four-engined bombers for massed raids continued into the immediate postwar period; the [[Avro Lincoln]], an updated version of the [[Avro Lancaster]], became the RAF's standard bomber.<ref>McLelland 2013, p. 18.</ref> In 1946, the [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] issued Operational Requirements OR229 and OR230 for the development of [[jet aircraft|turbojet]]-powered heavy bombers capable of carrying [[nuclear weapon]]s at high altitude and speed, without defensive armament, to act as a deterrent to hostile powers and, if deterrence failed, to perform a nuclear strike.<ref name=\"Turpin p. 71\"/> In conjunction with this ambition, Britain set about developing its own [[nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|atomic weapons]].<ref name = \"flint 131\"/>

In January 1947, the British [[Air Ministry]] issued [[Air Ministry specification|Specification B.35/46]] for an advanced jet bomber intended to carry nuclear weapons and to fly near the speed of sound at altitudes of {{cvt|50000|ft|m}}.<ref name = 'Rose 52'/> Three firms: [[Avro|A.V. Roe]], [[Handley-Page Aircraft Company|Handley-Page]] and [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] submitted advanced designs intended to meet the stringent requirements.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p397\">Burnet and Morgan  ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1980, p. 397.</ref> While [[Short Brothers]] submitted a design, by [[Geoffrey T. R. Hill]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aerocinema.com/product/the-lost-v-bomber-2.html|title=Aerocinema-The Lost V Bomber|work=aerocinema.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141124185209/http://aerocinema.com/product/the-lost-v-bomber-2.html|archivedate=24 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> that was judged too ambitious, the Air Staff accepted another submission from the company for a separate requirement, B.14/46, as \"insurance\" in case the advanced B.35/46 effort ran into trouble. Aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist described Specification B.14/46 as \"calling for little more than a traditional aircraft fitted with jet engines\"<ref name = \"bomber 72\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 72.</ref> Short submitted a conservative design to meet B.14/46, which became the [[Short Sperrin|S.A.4 Sperrin]].<ref name = 'Rose 52'/> Two prototypes were completed, the first conducting its [[maiden flight]] in 1951, but the Sperrin was ultimately relegated to research and development purposes only.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p397\"/><ref name = \"flint 131\"/>

Vickers had emerged from the Second World War as one of the world's pre-eminent companies in the field of aeronautical manufacturing and development. Furthermore, the company operated its own secretive [[Skunk Works]]-like development organisation based at Weybridge, Surrey, which had been involved in several secret wartime development projects. It was this secretive division in which the early stages of the development of the Valiant took place, including the later assembly of the initial two prototypes.<ref name = \"bomber 72 73\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 72–73.</ref> Vickers initially produced a six-engine jet bomber design proposal to meet Specification B.35/46; as rapid progress in the development of more powerful jet engines had been made, this was re-worked to a four-engine proposal in 1948.<ref name = \"bomber 73\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 73.</ref> The proposed design submitted by Vickers was relatively straightforward, being less aerodynamically advanced in comparison to competing bids made by rival firms.<ref name = \"bomber 72\"/><ref name = \"black wright 17\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 17.</ref>

Both Handley-Page and Avro had produced advanced designs for the bomber competition. These would be produced as the [[Handley Page Victor|Victor]] and the [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan]] respectively; the Air Staff decided to award contracts to each company as a form of insurance in case one of these designs failed. The submissions became known as the [[V bomber]]s, or V-class, with the aircraft all being given names that started with the letter \"V\".<ref>Downey 1985, p. 5.</ref> Vickers' submission had initially been rejected as not being as advanced as the Victor and the Vulcan,<ref name = 'Rose 52'>Rosemeyer 2009, p. 52.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 72\"/> but Vickers' chief designer [[George Edwards (aviation)|George Edwards]] lobbied the Air Ministry on the basis that it would be available much sooner than the competition, going so far as to promise that a flight-capable prototype would be flown by the end of 1951, that subsequent production aircraft would be flown prior to the end of 1953, and that serial deliveries would commence during early 1955. Gunston and Gilchrist observe that measures offered by Edwards were a \"gigantic risk\", and that gaining the bomber contract has been deemed of crucial importance to the future of aircraft manufacturing at Vickers.<ref name = \"bomber 73\"/>

Although developing and operating three overlapping large aircraft in response to a single Operational Requirement (OR) was wasteful and very costly, events such as the [[Berlin Blockade]] had led to officials placing a sense of urgency in the necessity to provide an effective deterrent to the Soviet Union from acts of aggression in Europe.<ref>Rosemeyer 2009, pp. 52–53.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 72\"/> In April 1948, the [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] issued a specification with the designation B.9/48 written around the Vickers design, which was given the company designation of Type 660; an 'Instruction to Proceed' was received by Vickers on 16 April 1948.<ref name = \"bomber 73\"/> In February 1949, two prototypes of the aircraft were ordered. The first of these was to be fitted with four [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] [[Rolls-Royce Avon|RA.3 Avon]] [[turbojet]] engines, while the second was to be fitted with four [[Armstrong Siddeley]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire|Sapphire]] engines as the Type 667.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p438\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 438.</ref>

===Prototypes===
[[File:Vickers Valiant Farnborough 1951.jpg|thumb|First prototype performing a flight display at [[Farnborough Airshow]], 1951]]
On 18 May 1951, the first prototype, [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial number]] WB210 took to the air for its [[maiden flight]],<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p439\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 439.</ref> within the deadline that George Edwards had promised, and preceding the first [[Short Sperrin]] into the air by several months, it being only 27 months since the contract had been issued. The pilot was [[Joseph Summers|Captain Joseph \"Mutt\" Summers]], who had also been the original test pilot on the [[Supermarine Spitfire]], and wanted to add another \"first\" to his record before he retired. His co-pilot on the first flight was Gabe \"Jock\" Bryce, who succeeded Summers as Vickers' chief test pilot upon his retirement shortly afterwards.<ref name=\"Turpin p. 72\">Turpin 2002, p. 72.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 10\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 10.</ref><ref>McLelland 2013, p. 68.</ref> The next month, the Vickers Type 660 was given the official name of \"Valiant\", recycling the name given to the [[Vickers 131 Valiant|Vickers Type 131]] general-purpose biplane of 1931.{{#tag:ref|Traditionally, RAF bombers had been named after towns and cities, for example Lancaster, [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax]] and [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]], but the new aircraft technology seemed to suggest a break from tradition; the name also fitted in with an equally long held tradition of alliteration in aircraft names.|group=N}} The name Valiant had been selected by a survey of Vickers employees.<ref name=\"Jones p31,3\">Jones 2007, pp. 31, 33.</ref>

On 11 January 1952, the first Valiant prototype was lost while making internal noise measurements for the V.1000 programme. Testing included engine shutdowns and re-lights,<ref>The Vickers Valiant, C F Andrews, Profile Publications Ltd., P O Box 26, Leatherhead, p.4</ref> one of which caused a fire in the starboard wing; most of the crew managed to escape the aircraft safely, except for the co-pilot, who struck the tail after ejecting.<ref name=\"Flight p13\">''Flight'' 4 July 1958, p. 13.</ref><ref>Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 11–16.</ref>  After modifications to the fuel system the second prototype, serial number WB215, the Vickers Type 667, conducted its maiden flight on 11 April 1952.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p440\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 440.</ref> It was fitted with more powerful RA.7 Avon engines with {{convert|7500|lbf|kN}} thrust each, rather than the Sapphires that had been originally planned; it also featured more rounded [[Components of jet engines#Air intakes|air inlet]]s, replacing the narrow slot-type intakes of the first prototype, in order to feed sufficient air to the more powerful engines. The short delay until the second prototype became available for testing, which was accelerated by three months, meant that loss of the initial prototype did not seriously compromise the schedule.<ref name=\"Turpin p74\">Turpin 2002, p. 74.</ref><ref name=\"Jones p34\">Jones 2007, p. 34.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 17\"/>

Of the three prototypes, two were representative of the Valiant B.1,<ref name=\"Jones p26\">Jones 2007, p. 26.</ref> while one was built as a further developed version, referred to as the Valiant B.2. The B.2 variant was intended to serve as a [[Pathfinder (RAF)|Pathfinder]] aircraft, flying at high speed at low level to mark targets for the main bomber force. To cope with the rougher ride compared with high altitude operations, the B.2 had a strengthened airframe. In particular, the wing received design alterations to strengthen it, a key change being the removal of the large cut-outs in the wing structure into which the main wheels retracted, allowing the wing torsion box structure to be uninterrupted and giving more room for internal fuel storage; instead the main landing gear, which had four wheels instead of the two large wheels of the B.1, retracted backwards into large [[Aircraft fairing|fairing]]s set into the rear of the wings.<ref name = \"bomber 77 78\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 77–78.</ref> The B.2 had a lengthened fuselage with a total length of {{convert|112|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}}, in contrast to a length of {{convert|108|ft|3|in|abbr=on}} for the Valiant B.1, with the extra length giving room for more avionics.<ref name=\"Jones p32,6\">Jones 2007, pp. 32, 36.</ref>

The prototype B.2, serial number WJ954 first flew on 4 September 1953.<ref name=\"AndrewsVickers p445\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 445.</ref> Finished in a gloss black night operations paint scheme, it became known as the \"Black Bomber\". Its performance at low level was superior to that of the B.1 (or any other V-bomber), being strong enough to fly at full power at [[sea level#Aviation|sea level]],<ref name = \"bomber 77\"/> with the aircraft being cleared for {{convert|580|mph|abbr=on}} at low level (with speeds of up to {{convert|640|mph|abbr=on}} being reached in testing). This was compared to the B.1's sea-level limit of {{convert|414|mph|abbr=on|round=5}}. The Air Ministry ordered 17 production B.2s, which were to be powered by [[Rolls-Royce Conway]] [[turbofan]]s. Although the Valiant B.2's low-level capabilities later proved to be highly desirable, the B.2 program was abandoned as the RAF considered that the Pathfinder concept, born in a time of mass raids, was obsolete in the nuclear era.<ref name = \"bomber 78\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 78.</ref> The B.2 prototype was used for tests for a few years, including testing use of rockets to boost takeoff, contributing to improvements for the Valiant B.1, before being scrapped in 1958.<ref name=\"Jones p36-7\">Jones 2007, pp. 36–37.</ref><ref name=\"Osprey p83-4\">Brookes 2012, pp. 83–84.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 20\"/>

===Production===
[[File:Vickers Valian B.1 WZ393 90 Sqn SGT 10.06.57.jpg|thumb|Valiant B(PR)K.1 WZ393 of 90 Squadron in original all-metal finish displaying at Blackpool Squires Gate airport in 1957]]
In April 1951, an initial production order for 25 Valiant B.1 (Bomber Mark 1) aircraft was placed by the Ministry of Supply on behalf of the RAF.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p400\">Burnet and Morgan ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1980, p. 400.</ref> The timing of this order was key to establishing production quickly. Due to shortages of [[steel]] and other materials while setting up an assembly line at Brooklands, substantial portions of the production [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] for the Valiant were made from [[concrete]].<ref name = \"bomber 77\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 77.</ref> The first five Valiants produced were completed to a pre-production standard, the first being WP199. On 21 December 1953, the production aircraft conducted its first flight; this had again occurred within the schedule that Edwards had promised.<ref name=\"Jones p37\">Jones 2007, p. 37.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 77\"/>

On 8 February 1955, this first production Valiant was delivered to the RAF.<ref name=\"Osprey p12\">Brookes 2012, p. 12.</ref><ref name = \"flint 131\">Flintham 2008, p. 131.</ref> Britain's \"V-bomber\" force, as it had been nicknamed in October 1952, formally entered operational service on that day. The Victor and Vulcan would soon follow the Valiant into service, for a total of three types of nuclear-armed strategic bombers in RAF service. In September 1957, the final Valiant was delivered.<ref name = \"hub and sim 26\"/> According to Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, all production aircraft had been delivered on time and below budget.<ref name = \"bomber 78\"/>

A total of 108 Valiants were manufactured, including the sole B.2 prototype. In addition to its principal role as the RAF's delivery platform for Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]], the Valiant bomber also dropped high explosive bombs. The bombers were followed into service by a strategic reconnaissance version and a multi-purpose version capable conventional bombing, [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[aerial refueling|aerial refuelling]]. One squadron operated 6 Valiants with [[electronic countermeasure]]s equipment.<ref name = \"black wright 19 20\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 19–20.</ref>  Valiants of 90 and 214 squadrons were used for air refuelling through the addition of a Hose Drum Unit (HDU) in the bomb bay, mounted on the same suspension units that were also used for bombs.  This meant that for refuelling, the bomb-bay doors had to be opened so that the refuelling hose could be streamed (unlike later tankers where the HDU was flush with the under fuselage rather than inside a bomb bay).  Several Valiants were also used for testing and development purposes, such as its use as a flying testbed during trials of the [[Blue Steel (missile)|Blue Steel]] nuclear-armed [[standoff missile]], which was later added to the arsenal of munitions the other V-bombers were equipped with.<ref name = \"black wright 24 26\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 24–26.</ref><ref name = \"flint 133\">Flintham 2008, p. 133.</ref>

Unlike its Vulcan and Victor peers, the Valiant did not see the production of a refined and more capable B.2 model.<ref name = \"flint 131\"/> Instead, the Valiant B.1 fleet was later switched to a low-level flight profile, after which [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] due to the resulting increased turbulence was discovered and ultimately led to the type's premature retirement. Vic Flintham observed that: \"There is a fine irony to the situation, for Vickers had produced the Type 673 B Mk 2 version designed as a fast, low-level pathfinder... The Air Ministry was not interested...\"<ref name = \"flint 133\"/> The Valiant was Vickers' last purpose-built military aircraft. It was followed by the [[Vickers Vanguard|Vanguard]], a passenger turboprop designed in 1959, and the [[Vickers VC10]], a jet passenger aircraft in 1962, also used as a military transport and tanker by the RAF.<ref name = \"flint 131\"/>

==Design==
[[File:Vickers Valiant (27363801724).jpg|thumb|Forward view of preserved Vickers Valiant XD818 at [[RAF Museum Cosford]] ]]
The Valiant was a conservative design of the era, having a shoulder-mounted wing and four [[Rolls-Royce Avon|Rolls-Royce Avon RA.3]] [[turbojet]] engines, each providing up to {{convert|6500|lbf|kN}} of thrust, installed in pairs in [[fireproof]] bays in each wing root.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> The design of the Valiant gave an overall impression of a plain and clean aircraft with simple aerodynamics. George Edwards described the Valiant appropriately and simply as an \"unfunny\" aircraft.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p449\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 449.</ref> The root chord thickness ratio was 12% and allowed the Avon engines to be within the wing rather than on pods as in the contemporary [[B-47 Stratojet|Boeing B-47]].<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p442\">Andrews and Morgan, p. 442.</ref> This \"buried engine\" installation contributed to the aircraft's aerodynamic cleanness, and was British practice at the time. It made engine access for maintenance and repair difficult and increased the risk that an uncontained failure of one engine would cause damage to the adjacent engine; it also increased the complexity of the design of the main spar which had to be routed around the engines.<ref name = \"bomber 73 74\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 73–74.</ref>

The wing of the Valiant used a \"compound sweep\" configuration, devised by Vickers [[aerodynamics|aerodynamicist]] Elfyn Richards.<ref name=\"Barfield p158\">Barfield ''Air International'' September 1992, p. 158.</ref> Richards found that it would be advantageous to increase the sweep on the inboard section of the wing, a discovery which he later [[patent]]ed; the Valiant's wing made use of a 37° angle of sweepback for the inner third of the wing, which reduced to an angle of about 21° at the tips.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p398\">Burnet and Morgan  ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1980, p. 398.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 74\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 74.</ref> This was because the thickness/chord ratio could be reduced closer to the tips, balancing this against the sweep reduction in postponement of supersonic airflow effects such as buffeting and increased drag.<ref name=\"Barfield p158\"/> The choice to have mild sweepback around the aerodynamic control surfaces meant that in-service speeds were limited to Mach 0.84 and a typical cruise of Mach 0.75 at heights up to {{convert|55000|ft}} when lightly loaded.<ref name=\"Profile p16\">Andrews 1966, p. 16.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 17 18\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 17–18.</ref> A [[drogue parachute]] was deemed unnecessary even operating from runways as short as {{Convert|6000|ft}}.<ref name = \"bomber 77\"/>

The wing was mounted high on the aircraft's fuselage and this created a limited fuel capacity when combined with the other necessary compromises in design such as the placement of the engines and main [[landing gear]] within the wing's internal space.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> The [[leading edge]] of the wing was fixed while the [[trailing edge]] incorporated large outboard two-section [[aileron]]s, the inner section featuring [[trim tab]]s, alongside double-slotted [[Flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s again split into inboard and outboard sections.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 75–76.</ref> Direct [[electric motor|electrical drive]]s were used to move the flaps and other, usually hydraulically-operated, equipment on the aircraft.<ref name = \"bomber 76\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 76.</ref>

[[File:Valiant 2 (3446560911).jpg|thumb|left|The wing root and air intakes]]
Production aircraft were powered by four Avon 201 turbojet engines, with {{convert|9500|lbf|kN}} thrust. In addition to providing thrust for flight, the engines also provided [[bleed air]] for the [[pressurization]], [[ice protection system|ice protection]], and [[air conditioning]] systems. The aircraft's electrical [[Electric generator|generator]]s were also driven by the engines.<ref name = \"bomber 76\"/> [[Napier & Son|Napier Spraymat]] [[electric heating|electric heaters]] were installed in the engine inlets to prevent engine damage due to ice forming on the duct surfaces and then shedding into the compressors. The shape of the engine inlets were long rectangular slots in the first prototype, while the production Valiants had oval or \"spectacle\" shaped inlets designed to pass greater airflow for the more powerful engines that were installed.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p442\"/> The jet exhausts emerged from fairings above the trailing edge of the wings.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p442\"/>

For required takeoff performance from short tropical dispersal bases,<ref>Bombers of the West, Bill Gunston 1973, {{|ISBN 684 13623 6}}, p.50</ref> a [[jettison (aviation)|jettisonable]] [[RATO|rocket booster engine]]s pack was developed for the Valiant.<ref name = \"bomber 78\"/> Trials were performed with two underwing [[de Havilland Sprite]] boosters; these were ultimately deemed unnecessary when more powerful variants of the Avon engine became available. Also, there was an increased risk of accidents if one booster rocket failed on takeoff, resulting in asymmetric thrust.<ref name = \"black wright 20\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 20.</ref> Some Valiant engines had [[water injection (engines)|water injection]], which increased takeoff thrust by about {{convert|1000|lb|kg}} per engine.<ref name = \"darling 41\">Darling 2012, p. 41.</ref>

The crew of the Valiant were contained in a pressurized compartment in the forward area of the aircraft and consisted of a pilot, co-pilot, two navigators, and air signaller (later called an air electronics officer);<ref name = \"black wright 28\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 28.</ref> the manufacturing of this pressurized section was subcontracted to [[Saunders-Roe]]. The pilot and co-pilot were located on an upper level in a side-by-side arrangement, the remaining three crewmen sat at stations set lower in the cockpit to the rear.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 74–75.</ref> A crew of five had been enabled by the discontinuation of defensive [[gun turret]]s and accompanying [[air gunner]]s, a design philosophy proved by the successful [[De Havilland Mosquito]] bomber of World War II.<ref name = \"bomber 74\"/>{{#tag:ref|Vickers had proposed the installation of a pair of 20 mm [[revolver cannon|cannon]]s in the tailcone; this concept was never explored beyond the drawing board.<ref name = \"bomber 78\"/>|group=N}} The pilot and copilot were provided with [[Martin-Baker]] [[Martin-Baker Mk.3|Mk.3]] [[ejector seat]]s, while the rear crewmen were expected to bail out of the oval main entrance door.<ref name=\"Turpin p79-0\">Turpin 2002, pp. 79–80.</ref> It has been claimed that the survivability of the rear crewmen was substantially reduced due to the ineffectiveness of this method of escape.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/>

[[File:Vickers Valiant B1 (3873562557).jpg|thumb|The crewmen's entry door on the side of the forward fuselage]]
The fuselage area behind the pressurised crew section and forward of the wing was used to house much of the Valiant's [[avionics]], [[air conditioning]], and the retractable main [[landing gear]].<ref name = \"bomber 75\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 75.</ref> The Valiant featured a [[tricycle landing gear]] arrangement, with twin-wheel nosegear and [[tandem]]-wheel main gear that retracted outwards recessed set into the wing. Each of the main gears were equipped with multipad [[anti-lock braking system|anti-skid]] [[disc brake]]s, and were [[telescoping (mechanics)|telescopic]]ally linked so that a single drive motor could pull them up into the wing recesses.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> Most of the aircraft's systems were electrically powered, including the [[Flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s and [[landing gear|undercarriage]].<ref name = \"darling 39\">Darling 2012, p. 39.</ref> The brakes and steering gear were [[hydraulics|hydraulic]]ally powered, the pumps themselves were electrically driven.<ref name=\"Flight p19\"/><ref name = \"black wright 18\"/> The lower half of the aircraft's nose contained the scanner of a powerful [[H2S (radar)|H2S]] [[radar]] in a large [[glass fiber]] [[radome]]; in addition, a visual [[bomb sight]] was set beneath the lower floor of the pressurised section.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> The avionics bay could be accessed via an entrance at the base of the rear fuselage leading to an internal [[catwalk]] above the aft of the [[bomb bay]].<ref name = \"bomber 76 77\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 76–77.</ref>

The electrics were powered by 112 volt [[direct current]] generators for functions requiring large amounts of electrical power, and a 28 V DC system provided a controlling voltage for other systems and the actuators that initiated the higher-voltage system functions. Backup batteries were a bank of 24 V units and 96 V batteries. 115 V [[alternating current]] was provided to systems such as radio and radar that required it; the [[actuator]]s for the flight surfaces, flaps, [[Air brake (aeronautics)|air brake]]s and undercarriage were also powered via this facility.<ref name=\"Flight p19\">''Flight'' 4 July 1958, p. 19.</ref><ref name=\"Turpin p78\">Turpin 2002, p. 78.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 18\"/> It was decided during development that as much of the aircraft would be electrically-driven as was possible; this design choice was due to electrical cabling being lighter than its hydraulic equivalent, and the already-present high power electrical generators to meet requirements of energy-hungry equipment such as the radar.<ref name = \"bomber 76\"/>

The [[aircraft flight control system|flight control]]s of the Valiant consisted of two channels of power control with full manual backup; flying in manual was allowed but limited, being intended to be used only in the event of complete electrical failure.<ref name=\"Flight p19\"/> The flight controls reportedly required considerable effort to manually operate.<ref name = \"black wright 18\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 18.</ref> All three axes of the flight controls featured a dynamic [[Aircraft flight control system#Artificial feel devices|artificial feel]] system, the pressure for which was provided via a [[ram-air intake|ram-air inlet]].<ref name = \"bomber 76\"/> A [[GE Aviation Systems|Smith Aerospace]] [[autopilot]] and [[instrument landing system]] (ILS) functionality was installed along with various [[navigational aid]]s, such as the [[Marconi Company]]-built [[Green Satin radar|Green Satin]] [[doppler radar]], [[Gee (navigation)|Gee]] [[radio navigation]], [[Non-directional beacon|Automatic Direction Finder]] (ADF), [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]]/[[distance measuring equipment|Distance Measuring Equipment]] (DME), and [[radar altimeter]]s.<ref name = \"bomber 77\"/> Provisions for additional equipment and sensors, such as [[side looking airborne radar]], were also made.<ref name = \"bomber 77\"/>

[[File:Handley Page K2 (10024223034).jpg|thumb|left|Landing gear and wing]]
The main centre fuselage of the Valiant was highly strengthened around a massive backbone beam to appropriately support the weight and stresses of the two widely-set [[Spar (aeronautics)|wing spar]]s and five protected [[fuel cell]]s located in the upper portions of this section, the sizable [[bomb bay]] was also in the lower half of the centre fuselage.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/><ref name=\"Flight p18\">''Flight'' 4 July 1958, p. 18.</ref> The aft fuselage used a [[monocoque|semi-monocoque]] structure, being far lighter than the centre fuselage; the [[Boulton Paul Aircraft|Boulton-Paul]]-produced electro-hydraulic power units for the ailerons, [[elevator (aeronautics)|elevator]]s, and [[rudder]] were contained within this space.<ref name = \"bomber 76\"/> The tail, which was attached to the rear fuselage was of a simple design, being [[Cone|tapered]] rather than swept back,<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> the [[horizontal stabilizer|horizontal tailplane]] was mounted well up the [[vertical stabilizer|vertical fin]] to keep it clear of the engines' exhaust.<ref name=\"Barfield p158\"/> The tailcone contained a [[tail warning radar]].<ref name = \"bomber 78\"/>

The main structural components, spars and beams of the Valiant had been constructed from a zinc/magnesium/copper aluminium alloy designated as DTD683 in the UK, which later proved problematic.<ref>''Flight'' 14 December 1951, p. 756.</ref><ref>''Flight'' 17 July 1953, p. 91.</ref> The Valiant had been designed with a '[[Safe-life design|Safe-Life]]' strategy;<ref>Brookes Valiant Units of the Cold War, pp. 83.</ref> this combination of 'Safe-Life' and DTD683 came to be viewed as a severe mistake. In 1956, a publication within the Journal of the Institute of Metals<ref>''The Journal of the Institute of Metals'' (JIM), Vol. 86, No. 1790, 1957–1958.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Structural Changes Caused by Plastic Strain and by fatigue in Aluminium-Zinc-Magnesium-Copper Alloys Corresponding to DTD.683 (Broom and Mezza)|group=N}} condemned the material DTD683 as being unstable and capable of catastrophic failure when stressing the airframe close to its design limits.  The \"Safe-Life\" design strategy was dismissed by a Lockheed engineer in a talk given to the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] in 1956, because it did not guarantee safety from catastrophic failure.<ref>''Flight'' 6 April 1956, p. 394.</ref>

The Valiant B.1 could carry a single {{convert|10,000|lb|kg}} [[nuclear weapon]] or up to 21 {{convert|1,000|lb|kg}} conventional [[bomb]]s in its bomb bay. The Valiant had been designed not only to accommodate the early [[Nuclear fission|fission]]-based nuclear weapons, but also the newer and larger [[thermonuclear]] [[hydrogen bomb]]s.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> A \"clean\" Valiant (one without underwing tanks) could climb straight to 50,000&nbsp;ft after takeoff unless it had heavy stores in the large bomb bay.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In the [[aerial reconnaissance]] role, a camera crate would be installed in the bomb bay, along with a pair of cameras set into the fuselage and larger rear fuel tanks to extend the aircraft's endurance.<ref name = \"black wright 19\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 19.</ref> Large external fuel tanks under each wing with a capacity of {{convert|1,650|Impgal|l}}, could be used to extend range; an auxiliary fuel tank could also be installed in the forward area of the bomb bay; the external wing tanks were fitted as standard on Valiants that were operated as [[aerial refueling|aerial refuelling]] tankers.<ref name = \"black wright 19\"/> For receiving fuel, a fixed [[aerial refueling#Probe-and-drogue 2|refuelling probe]] was fitted onto the aircraft's nose, this was connected to the fuel tanks via a pipe running along the outside of the canopy to avoid penetrating the pressure cabin.<ref name = \"bomber 79\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 79.</ref>

==Operational history==

===Nuclear deterrent===
[[File:YellowSunBomb2.JPG|thumb|right|Side view of a [[Yellow Sun (nuclear weapon)|Yellow Sun]] nuclear bomb under the wing of Vickers Valiant XD818 at the [[RAF Cosford]] museum]]

The first squadron to be equipped with the Valiant was [[No. 138 Squadron RAF|138 Squadron]], which formed at [[RAF Gaydon]] on 1 January 1955, with 232 Operational Conversion Unit forming at Gaydon on 21 February 1955 to convert crews to the new bomber.<ref name = \"darling 40\"/> Since the Valiant was part of an entirely new class of bombers for the RAF, the crews for the new type were selected from experienced aircrew, with first pilots requiring 1,750 flying hours as an aircraft captain, with at least one tour flying the Canberra, with second pilots needing 700 hours in command and the remaining three crewmembers had to be recommended for posting to the Valiant by their commanding officers.<ref name=\"Jones p79-2\">Jones 2007, pp. 79–82.</ref> Valiants were originally assigned to the strategic nuclear bombing role, as were the Vulcan and Victor B.1s when they became operational. At its peak, the Valiant equipped ten RAF squadrons.<ref name=\"Osprey p92\"/><ref>Wynn, pp. 564-565.</ref>

According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the Valiant had performed \"extremely well\" during bombing competition hosted by American [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC).<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/> American interest in the Valiant resulted in a visit to Vickers by USAF generals [[Hoyt Vandenberg|Vandenberg]], Johnson and [[Curtis LeMay|LeMay]]. Vickers test-pilot Brian Trubshaw believed that George Edwards was put under some pressure to build the Boeing B-47 under license. The only result from the visit was Le May's insistence that the Valiant pilot side-by-side seating be incorporated in the B-52 instead of the tandem arrangement in the B-47 and prototype B-52.<ref>Brian Trubshaw Test Pilot, Brian Trubshaw and Sally Edmondson, Sutton Publishing Limited 1999, {{ISBN|0 7509 1838 1}}, p.35</ref>

On 11 October 1956, a Valiant B.1 (WZ366) of No 49 Squadron was the first RAF aircraft to drop a British operational atomic bomb when it performed a test drop of a down-rated [[Blue Danube bomb|Blue Danube]] weapon on [[Maralinga]], [[South Australia]].<ref name=\"Mason Bomber p378\">Mason 1994, p. 378.</ref> Windscreen blinds were fitted in advance of the test to protect the crew from the intense flash of light from the nuclear detonation. Following the landing of the aircraft after deploying the weapon, WZ366 was assessed for potential damage and for [[radioactive contamination]].<ref>Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 33–36.</ref>

On 15 May 1957, a Valiant B(K).1 (XD818) dropped the first British [[hydrogen bomb]], the Short Granite, over the Pacific as part of [[Operation Grapple]].<ref name=\"RAF\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/documents/collections/1994-1352-A-Valiant-XD818.pdf|title=Individual History Vickers Valiant B (K) Mk.I XD818/7894M Museum Accession Number 1994/1352/A |publisher=Royal Air Force Museum |accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> No 49 Squadron was selected to perform the live weapon drop, and were equipped with specially-modified Valiants to conform with the scientific requirements of the tests and other precautionary measures to protect against heat and radiation.<ref>Hubbard and Simmons 2008, pp. 61, 68.</ref> The test was largely a failure, as the measured yield was less than a third of the maximum expected and while achieving the desired [[thermonuclear]] explosion the device had failed to operate as intended. The first British hydrogen bomb that detonated as planned was dropped in the Grapple X test on 8 November 1957.<ref name = \"hub and sim 157\">Hubbard and Simmons 2008, p. 157.</ref> The Grapple series of tests continued into 1958, and in April 1958 the Grapple Y bomb exploded with ten times the yield of the original \"Short Granite\".<ref name = \"hub and sim 167\">Hubbard and Simmons 2008, p. 167.</ref> Testing was finally terminated in November 1958, when the British government decided it would perform no more air-delivered nuclear tests.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/>

Originally the bombing role was to have been carried out at high altitude, but following the shooting down in 1960 of the [[Lockheed U-2]] flown by Gary Powers by an early Soviet [[SA-2]] Guideline missile, the SAM threat caused the V-force to train for low-level attack as a means of avoiding radar detection when flying within hostile airspace. They were repainted in grey/green camouflage with normal markings, replacing their [[anti-flash white]] scheme.<ref name = \"flint 133\"/> By 1963, four Valiant squadrons (49, 148, 207 and 214) had been assigned to [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SACEUR]] in the low-level tactical bombing role.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/> By this point, there had been a noticeable decline in flying rates for the type.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/>

===Conventional warfare===
[[File:vickers valiant camouflaged on ground arp.jpg|thumb|Camouflaged Valiant at [[Bristol Filton Airport|Filton]], [[England]]. Circa mid-1960s]]
Peacetime practice involved the dropping of small practice bombs on instrumented bombing ranges, and a system of predicted bombing using radio tones to mark the position of the bomb drop over non-range targets, the bomb error being calculated by a ground radar unit and passed either to the crew during flight or to a headquarters for analysis. Use of the Valiant's Navigational and Bombing System (NBS) and the high quality of assigned crews, who were typically veterans and often had been previously decorated for wartime service, meant a high level of bombing accuracy could be achieved, greater than that of aircraft during the Second World War. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, Valiant crews were able to place practice bombs from an altitude of {{convert|45,000|ft}} within a few meters of their assigned target.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/>

The Valiant was the first of the V-bombers to see combat, during the Anglo-French-Israeli Suez intervention in October and November 1956. During [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]], the British military operation in what became known as the [[Suez Crisis]], Valiants operating from the airfield at Luqa on Malta repeatedly dropped conventional bombs on targets inside Egypt. Egyptian military airfields were the principal target of these bombing raids; other targets included communications such as [[radio station]]s and transport hubs.<ref>Bowman 2016, p. 158</ref> On the first night of the operation, six Valiants were dispatched to bomb [[Cairo West Air Base]] (which was aborted in flight due to potential risk to US personnel in the vicinity) while six more attacked [[Almaza Air Base]] and a further five bombed [[Kibrit Air Base]] and Huckstep Barracks.<ref name = \"black wright 42\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 42.</ref><ref name = \"darling 42\">Darling 2012, p. 42.</ref>

Although the Egyptians did not oppose the attacks and there were no Valiant combat losses incurred, the results of the raids were reportedly disappointing. Although the Valiants dropped a total of {{convert|842|LT}} of bombs, only three of the seven airfields attacked were seriously damaged.{{#tag:ref|The Valiants had not yet been fitted with their operational Navigational and Bombing System (NBS) and were dropping using Second World War techniques.|group=N}} The Egyptian Air Force had been effectively destroyed in a wider series of multinational attacks of which the Valiant bombing missions had been a part.<ref>Bowman 2016, pp. 158, 161.</ref> It was the last time the V-bombers flew a live combat mission until Avro Vulcans bombed Port Stanley airfield in the Falkland Islands during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.<ref>McClelland, pp.175–178.</ref>

===Tanker operations===
Valiant tankers were flown by No. 214 Squadron at [[RAF Marham]], operational in 1958, and No. 90 Squadron at Honington, operational in 1959.<ref name = \"hub and sim 26\"/> The two lost their bomber role and became full-time tanker squadrons on 1 April 1962.<ref>Brookes 1982, p. 142</ref> Aircraft assigned to the tanker role were fitted with a Hose Drum Unit (HDU or \"HooDoo\") in the bomb bay. The HDU was mounted on bomb-mounting points and could be removed if necessary; this arrangement meant that the bomb bay doors had to be opened in order to give fuel to a receiver aircraft. A control panel at the radar navigator station in the cockpit was used to operate the HDU.  All of the HDU equipment was designed to be easily removable so that the aircraft could be reverted to the bomber role.<ref>Tanner 2006, pp. 113–114.</ref>

With in-flight refuelling probes fitted to Valiants, Vulcans and Victors and Valiant tankers available to give fuel and extend the range of the aircraft being refuelled, the RAF Medium Bomber Force could go beyond \"medium range\", and the RAF had a long range capability. Long-range demonstration flights were made using Valiant tankers pre-deployed along the route. In 1960, a Valiant bomber flew non-stop from Marham in the UK to Singapore and in 1961 a Vulcan flew non-stop from the UK to Australia.<ref name = \"hub and sim 26\">Hubbard and Simmons 2008, p. 26.</ref> The two tanker squadrons regularly practised long range missions, refuelled by other Valiant tankers on the way. These included non-stop flights from the UK to [[Nairobi]], [[Singapore]] and [[Sydney]].<ref>Brookes 1982, pp. 141–142</ref> In 1963 a squadron of [[Gloster Javelin]] fighters was refuelled by tankers and flew in stages from the UK to India (Exercise \"Shiksha\") to support the Indian Air Force in a dispute over their border with China.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pprune.org/aviation-history-nostalgia/525734-javelins-kalaikunda.html |title=Javelins at Kalaikunda |website=pprune.org |access-date=19 May 2018}}</ref> Other aircraft refuelled by Valiants at this time included Victor and Vulcan bombers, [[English Electric Lightning]] fighters, and [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]] and [[Supermarine Scimitar]] fighters of the Royal Navy.<ref>Wynn 1994, p. 168.</ref>

===Countermeasures and reconnaissance roles===
Valiants of [[No. 18 Squadron RAF]] at [[RAF Finningley]] were modified to the \"radio countermeasures\" (RCM) role—now called \"[[Electronic warfare support measures|electronic countermeasures]]\" (ECM). These aircraft were ultimately fitted with American APT-16A and ALT-7 jamming transmitters, Airborne Cigar and Carpet [[Radar jamming and deception|jammers]], APR-4 and APR-9 \"sniffing\" receivers, and [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]] dispensers. At least seven Valiants were configured to the RCM role.<ref>Brookes 2012, pp. 45–46.</ref><ref>[http://radionerds.com/images/a/af/JAM-EQP_HTM.txt]</ref>

Valiants of No. 543 Squadron at [[RAF Wyton]] were modified to serve in the photographic reconnaissance role. In one notable operation in 1965, Valiants of No. 543 Squadron photographed around {{convert|400000|sqmi}} of [[Rhodesia]] across an 11-week period.<ref name = \"hub and sim 26\"/>

===Fatigue failures and retirement===
In 1956, Vickers had performed a series of low level tests in WZ383 to assess the type for low level flight at high speed. Several modifications to the aircraft were made, including a metal radome, debris guards on the two inboard engines, and after six flights the aileron and elevator artificial feel was reduced by 50%. Pilots reported problems with cabin heating and condensation that would need remedying. The aircraft was fitted with data recording equipment and these data were used by Vickers to estimate the remaining safe life of the type under these flying conditions. Initially a safe life of 75 hours was recommended, which became \"the real figure might be less than 200 hours\".<ref>Morgan p. 66-68</ref> The number of hours flown by each Valiant in a year was an operational issue for the RAF.<ref>Valiant Units of the Cold War, Brookes p. 88.</ref>

[[File:15 Vickers Valiant WZ397 (15216077444).jpg|thumb|left|Vickers Valiant on display]]
Later the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]] ran a similar series of tests that more closely resembled actual operational conditions including low level and taxiing; the corresponding report published in 1958 produced data that could be used to get a better grasp on which flight conditions produced the most damage, and enable a better projection of the future life span for the type.<ref>[http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/cp/0521.pdf \"Fatigue Loadings in Flight-Loads in the Nose Undercarriage and Wing of a Valiant.\"] E.W. Wells, ARC C.P. No. 521.</ref>

In May 1957 ''Flight'' reported an \"incident at Boscombe Down, when a Valiant cracked a rear spar member after a rocket-assisted takeoff in overload conditions\"<ref>''Flight'' 17 May 1957, p. 651</ref> This aircraft was the second prototype WB 215; it was subsequently broken up for wing fatigue testing after it had flown 489 hours.<ref>Morgan p. 44 & p. 89.</ref> In July 1964, a cracked spar was found in one of the three Valiants (either WZ394 – Wynne, or WZ389 – Morgan) on Operation Pontifex.<ref>Wynn p. 469.</ref> This was followed on 6 August by a failure of the starboard wing rear spar at 30,000&nbsp;ft,<ref>Brookes, Victor Units of the Cold War, p. 67.</ref> in WP217, an OCU aircraft from Gaydon captained by Flight Lieutenant \"Taffy\" Foreman. The aircraft landed back at Gaydon but without flap deployment because damage to the starboard rear spar caused the flap rollers to come out of their guides so that the flap would not lower on that side. Later inspection of the aircraft also showed the fuselage skin below the starboard inner plane had buckled, popping the rivets; the engine door had cracked and the rivets had been pulled and the skin buckled on the top surface of the mainplane between the two engines.<ref name = \"darling 39 40\">Darling 2012, pp. 39–40.</ref> Both of these aircraft were PR variants.<ref>Morgan, App 2, Individual Valiant Histories pp. 89–94.</ref>

Inspections of the entire fleet showed that the wing spars were suffering from fatigue at between 35% and 75% of the assessed safe fatigue life, probably due to low level turbulence.<ref name = \"darling 40\">Darling 2012, p. 40.</ref> After this inspection, the aircraft were divided into three categories, Cat A aircraft continuing to fly, Cat B to fly to a repair base, and Cat C requiring repair before flying again. The tanker squadrons had the highest proportion of Cat A aircraft because their role had been mainly at high level.<ref name = \"darling 40\"/> This also caused the methods of assessing fatigue lives to be reviewed.<ref>Wynn 1996, p. 465.</ref> By the time the type was scrapped, only about 50 aircraft were still in service; the rest had been slowly accumulating at various RAF Maintenance Units designated as \"Non effective Aircraft\".<ref>Morgan App2, pp. 89–94.</ref>

Initially there was no question of retiring the type, or even a majority of affected aircraft. Repairs were actively taking place at Valiant bases such as Marham using working parties from Vickers plus RAF technicians from the base.  In January 1965, the Wilson government with [[Denis Healey]] as [[Secretary of State for Defence]] decided that the expense of the repairs could not be justified, given the short operational life left to the Valiant, and the fleet was permanently grounded as of 26 January 1965.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wGNAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nKMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5895,4007485&dq=vickers+valiant&hl=en \"Valiants to be Scrapped.\"] ''Glasgow Herald'', 27 January 1965.</ref> The QRA alert that had been in place for [[SACEUR]] was maintained until the final grounding and was then allowed to lapse.<ref>Wynn 1996, pp. 464–471, 500.</ref> When asked to make a statement regarding the Valiant's scrapping in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Denis Healey stated that it \"was not in any way connected with low-level flying\" and that the \"last Government took the decision to continue operating the Valiant force for another four years after its planned fatigue life was complete\".<ref>{{cite |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1965/feb/01/royal-air-force-valiant-aircraft#column_725|title=ROYAL AIR FORCE (VALIANT AIRCRAFT) |work=House of Commons Debates |date=1 February 1965 |volume=vol 705||at=cc723-7}}</ref>

Aviation author Barry Jones commented in his book that: \"A question has to be asked. For two years before the demise of the Valiant, Handley Page at Radlett had 100 [[Handley Page Hastings|Hastings]] go through their shops. They were completely dismantled and rebuilt, having DTD683 components removed and replaced by new alloy sections. What was so special about the Hastings and why was the Valiant not treated similarly? Perhaps we will know one day – but I doubt it.\" <ref>\"V-Bombers” Barry Jones p. 117.</ref> A ''Flight'' report about the scrapping states \"Fatigue affected all Valiants ... not only those that had been used for some low flying\".<ref>{{cite |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1965/1965%20-%200310.html|title=End of the Valiants|work=Flight International |date=4 February 1965 |page=184}}</ref>

On 9 December 1964, the last Valiant tanker sortie in XD812 of 214 Squadron was refuelling Lightning aircraft over the North Sea and was recalled to land back at Marham before the scheduled exercise was completed. On the same day, the last Valiant bomber sortie was carried out by XD818.{{#tag:ref|XD818 was also the aircraft which had dropped nuclear weapons during [[Operation Grapple]].|group=N}}

==Variants==
Including the three prototypes, a total of 107 Valiants were built.<ref>Brookes 2012, p. 45.</ref><ref name=\"Royal Air Force Museum\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalcoldwarexhibition.org/research/collections/vickers-valiant-b1/ |title=Vickers Valiant B1 |publisher=Royal Air Force Museum  |access-date=19 May 2018 }}</ref> 
* '''Valiant B.1''': 37 pure bomber variants, including five pre-production '''Type 600''', '''Type 667''' and '''Type 674'''s, which were powered by Avon RA.14 engines with the same {{convert|9,500|lbf}} thrust each as the earlier Avon 201 and 34 '''Type 706''' full-production aircraft, powered by Avon RA.28, 204 or 205 engines with {{convert|10,500|lbf}} thrust each, longer tailpipes and water-methanol injection for takeoff boost power.<ref name=\"Thunder and Lightnings\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk/valiant/history.php |title=Vickers Valiant - History |website=thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk |access-date=19 May 2018 }}</ref>
* '''Type 710 Valiant B(PR).1''': eleven bomber/photo-reconnaissance aircraft. Edwards and his team had considered use of the Valiant for photo-reconnaissance from the start, and this particular type of aircraft could accommodate a removable \"crate\" in the bomb-bay, carrying up to eight narrow-view/high resolution cameras and four survey cameras.<ref name=\"Thunder and Lightnings\" />
* '''Type 733 Valiant B(PR)K.1''': 14 bomber/photo-reconnaissance/tanker aircraft.<ref name=\"Thunder and Lightnings\" />
* '''Type 758 Valiant B(K).1''': 44 bomber / tanker aircraft. Both tanker variants carried a removable tanker system in the bomb bay, featuring fuel tanks and a hose-and-drogue [[aerial refuelling]] system. A further 16 Valiant B(K).1s were ordered, but cancelled.<ref name=\"Thunder and Lightnings\" />
* '''Valiant B.2''': 1 prototype.<ref name=\"Thunder and Lightnings\" />
* Vickers also considered an air transport version of the Valiant, with a low-mounted wing, wingspan increased from {{convert|114|ft|4|in}} to {{convert|140|ft}}, fuselage lengthened to {{convert|146|ft}}, and uprated engines. Work on a prototype, designated the Type 1000, began in early 1953. The prototype was to lead to a military transport version, the Type 1002, and a civilian transport version, the Type 1004 or VC.7. The Type 1000 prototype was almost complete when it, too, was cancelled.<ref name=\"Thunder and Lightnings\" />
Valiant production ended in August 1957.<ref name=\"Royal Air Force Museum\" /> An order for 17 B.2 models was cancelled.<ref name=\"Thunder and Lightnings\" />

==Background==
[[Paramount Pictures]] has been involved in the pay television industry since the 1950s. From 1953 to 1961, Paramount owned [[Telemeter (pay television)|Telemeter]], an ambitious but expensive theater television system that transmitted using [[closed-circuit television|closed circuitry]] – as opposed to broadcast frequencies – over which customers could purchase broadcasts by inserting coins into a collection box.

In April 1980, Paramount (then owned by [[Gulf and Western|Gulf+Western]]), [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]/[[Universal Studios]], [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]] partnered with [[Getty Oil]] to jointly develop a pay cable service called Premiere. The proposed channel would have maintained exclusive first-run rights to newer feature films distributed by each of the studios (which would have aired nine months before to their initial telecasts on other premium channels), along with carrying films cherry-picked from other studios without any exclusivity. Displeased that the venture would likely give the four studios disproportionate control of the pay television marketplace, [[Time-Life]], [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment]] and [[Viacom (1952–2006)|Viacom]]/[[TelePrompTer Corporation|TelePrompTer]] (the then respective owners of [[HBO]], [[The Movie Channel]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]) proceeded to file an antitrust lawsuit against the studios with the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] later that year. After reviewing the case, the Justice Department issued an injunction blocking Premiere's planned January 1, 1981 launch, deeming the venture to be an illegal boycott of the existing pay services that would subject them to possible financial damage if its presence resulted in price fixing of film titles. Paramount, MCA, Fox and Columbia decided to scrap the venture after the ruling was handed down.<ref>{{cite book|title=Joint Ventures, Alliances, and Corporate Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JeY_afXHSnEC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Kathryn Rudie Harrigan|publisher=Beard Books|date=January 1, 1985|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hollywood in the Information Age: Beyond the Silver Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuuuBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Janet Wasko|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=167|date=June 26, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>

In August 1982, MCA/Universal and Gulf+Western reached an agreement with [[Warner Communications]] to each acquire 25% interests in The Movie Channel, a struggling pay service then-owned by Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, a cable television venture of Warner and [[American Express]] that would retain the remaining 25%. This proposal was driven by the studios wanting to increase revenue received from licensing their films to premium television services, and industry concerns that dominant premium service HBO would hold undue negotiating power for these rights through its acquisitions of film titles prior to their theatrical release. In January 1983, the proposal was amended to include Viacom International, which proposed to consolidate The Movie Channel  and Showtime (of which Viacom had acquired the 50% interest inherited by [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W Cable]] through its prior merger with TelePrompTer for $75 million in August 1982) into one unit. Four of the partners would respectively own 22.58% of both networks, with American Express owning the remaining 9.68%. As with the earlier Premiere proposal, the Justice Department subjected the proposal to regulatory scrutiny as Warner, Universal and Paramount received 50% of their respective total revenue from film releases and licensing fees from premium services; the 30% share that would be held by the Showtime-TMC combination would have also formed an oligopoly in the pay cable market with HBO and [[Cinemax]] (which, even with the presence of smaller competitors at the time like [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]] and [[Home Theater Network]], controlled the remaining 60% of the market).<ref>{{cite news|title=5 COMPANIES IN VENTURE TO RUN 2 PAY-TV UNITS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/08/business/5-companies-in-venture-to-run-2-pay-tv-units.html|author=Sally Bedell|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 8, 1983}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Joint Ventures, Alliances, and Corporate Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JeY_afXHSnEC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Kathryn Rudie Harrigan|publisher=Beard Books|page=167|date=January 1, 1985|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hollywood in the Information Age: Beyond the Silver Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuuuBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Janet Wasko|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|page=167|date=June 26, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>

The proposal was revised twice to address these issues and others cited by HBO executives in responses to a civil antitrust lawsuit against the Showtime-Movie Channel merger that was filed by the Justice Department on June 10, 1983. This culminated in Paramount and Universal being dropped from the partnership in the final revision submitted on July 28, 1983; Warner Communications, Viacom and Warner-Amex became the only partners remaining in the proposal, which a Justice Department memorandum cited would \"prevent any anti-competitive effect [against other premium services wishing to enter the market] from arising,\" currying the Department's formal approval of the proposal on August 13 (three weeks before it was finalized on September 6). Shortly afterward, Paramount signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Showtime, which had already maintained a licensing deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer that gave the service exclusive pay cable rights to MGM's films.<ref name=\"ParamountSues\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=MGM/UA, Showtime renew deal|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR116021/|author=Christian Moerk|author2=John Dempsey|periodical=Variety|publisher=[[Fairchild Publications]]|date=November 22, 1993|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref>

Both of Showtime's tenures with Paramount ended in acrimony. In the spring of 1989, Paramount struck an exclusive licensing agreement with HBO; subsequently that May, Paramount filed a lawsuit against [[Showtime Networks]], its parent Viacom, and the corporate parent of both entities, [[National Amusements]] over Showtime's alleged refusal to pay a total of $88 million in fees for five films – all of which had underperformed in their theatrical release – to reduce the minimum liability for its 75-film package from the studio.<ref name=\"ParamountSues\">{{cite news|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Paramount Sues Viacom Over Fees|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/12/business/the-media-business-paramount-sues-viacom-over-fees.html|author=Geraldine Fabrikant|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 12, 1989|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref> Showtime regained first-run pay cable rights to Paramount's films through a seven-year distribution deal signed in May 1995, in a byproduct of Viacom's merger with Paramount Pictures parent [[Paramount Communications]] the year prior; this agreement gave the services of Showtime Networks – Showtime, The Movie Channel and [[Flix (TV network)|Flix]] – exclusive rights to all films released by the studio from 1997 onward starting in January 1998, following the expiration of Paramount's contract with HBO.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Showtime Networks (SNI) and Paramount Pictures announce exclusive output deal|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Showtime+Networks+%28SNI%29+and+Paramount+Pictures+announce+exclusive...-a016877979|agency=[[Business Wire]]|via=The Free Library|date=May 18, 1995|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>

[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) signed an exclusive first-run premium cable rights agreement with Showtime in 1981, encompassing the studio's films and releases through its [[United Artists]] subsidiary; Showtime and MGM renewed this agreement in April 1985 (for ten years, initially split with HBO and [[Cinemax]]),<ref>{{cite news|title=CABLE TV NOTES; EXPERIMENTATION SHAPES 'CAST IRON TV'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/14/arts/cable-tv-notes-experimentation-shapes-cast-iron-tv.html|author=Steve Schneider|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=April 14, 1985|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> September 1993 (for six years, with an extension signed in March 1998),<ref>{{cite news|title=MGM/UA, Showtime renew deal|url=https://variety.com/1993/film/news/mgm-ua-showtime-renew-deal-116021/|author=Christian Moerk|author2=John Dempsey|periodical=Variety|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=November 22, 1993|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=MGM, Showtime re-up|url=https://variety.com/1998/biz/news/mgm-showtime-re-up-1117468574/|author=Ray Richmond|periodical=Variety|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=March 9, 1998|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> and in April 2000 (for nine years).

(MGM had already produced some original programming for Showtime at the time of that deal, most notably ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' and ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', both adaptations of MGM-owned [[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|science fiction]] [[Stargate|franchises]].)<ref>{{cite web|title=MGM extends Showtime domestic pay-TV deal to 2008|author=Mike Goodridge|url=http://www.screendaily.com/mgm-extends-showtime-domestic-pay-tv-deal-to-2008/402171.article|publisher=ScreenDaily|date=April 25, 2000|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=MGM Agrees to Showtime Production Deal|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/25/business/fi-23228|agency=[[Bloomberg, L.P.|Bloomberg News]]|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=April 25, 2000|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> By 2002, after that studio finished a long-term distribution pact with HBO and Cinemax, [[Lionsgate|Lions Gate Entertainment]] joined Paramount and MGM as Showtime's major film suppliers.

(National Amusements re-merged the successor Viacom and CBS Corporation in December 2019 to form [[ViacomCBS]], bringing Showtime and Paramount back under the same immediate corporate umbrella.)<ref>{{cite news|title=Showtime's Film Suppliers Start Up Rival TV Channel|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/showtime%E2%80%99s-film-suppliers-start-rival-tv-channel/32169|author=Robert Marich|periodical=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=April 21, 2008|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref>

The formation of Epix was announced on April 21, 2008, after individual negotiations between Paramount Pictures, MGM, and Lionsgate with Showtime to renew their existing film output deals broke down; each of the three studios disagreed with Showtime over the licensing fee rates for which they wanted Showtime to compensate them to allow future releases to air on the Showtime Networks services.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paramount set to end movie sales to Showtime|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-151760313.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106161113/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-151760313.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=Tim Arango|newspaper=[[International New York Times|International Herald Tribune]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=April 22, 2008|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> In December 2008, the three studios – which named their jointly owned [[holding company]] for the channel, Studio 3 Partners – selected the name \"Epix\" for their premium linear television and on-demand service; the partnership formally announced the launch of Epix at the [[National Association of Television Program Executives]] (NATPE) Convention on January 27, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=NATPE 2009: Studio 3’s New Net Will Be Epix|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/syndication-and-distribution/natpe-2009-studio-3%E2%80%99s-new-net-will-be-epix/50779|author=Paige Albiniak|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=January 27, 2009|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}</ref> Mark Greenberg – who previously served as a marketing executive at HBO, [[executive vice president]] of Showtime, and managing director of management and consulting firm MSCGI (whose clients included [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Entertainment]], [[Comcast]] and Lionsgate) – created the business plan and strategy, then partnered with the Lionsgate/MGM/Paramount consortium to build and launch the network.

The network would focus on both recent feature films from Paramount (specifically those released after 2008), MGM/United Artists and Lionsgate (consisting of films released by each studio from 2009 onward) as well as library content from each of the studios. Within weeks of its October 2009 launch, Epix signed an exclusive first-run film content agreements with two additional studios: one with [[Samuel Goldwyn Films]] to broadcast a package of 20 recent and forthcoming theatrical movies from the studio,<ref>{{cite web|title=Goldywn Inks With Upstart Epix|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/wires/2009/08/06/goldywn-inks-with-upstart_ws_252490.html|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|publisher=The Huffington Post Media Group|via=[[IndieWire]]|date=August 6, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"EpixGoldwyn\">{{cite news|title=Epix Pay Channel To Show Samuel Goldwyn Films|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/34498/epix-pay-channel-to-show-samuel-goldwyn-films|author=Ryan Nakashima|agency=[[Associated Press]]|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheck Media|date=August 6, 2009|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> and another to carry a package of 22 recent and forthcoming featur films from independent film studio [[Roadside Attractions]] (of which Lions Gate Entertainment had acquired a 45% minority interest in July 2007).<ref>ref name=\"Epix Roadside\">{{cite web|title=Epix drives to Roadside Attractions|url=https://variety.com/2009/scene/markets-festivals/epix-drives-to-roadside-attractions-1118007991/|author=Cynthia Littleton|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=September 2, 2009|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> Studio 3 Partners chose the Viacom subdivision MTV Networks (later renamed Viacom Media Networks in January 2011, now known as [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks]] since the 2019 Viacom-CBS merger) to provide operational support, marketing services and affiliate distribution for the channel.<ref name=mp/>

Though Epix was first announced by Studio 3 Partners as strictly a premium service, it eventually began to seek distribution as a hybrid premium/digital basic channel, although its programming would be presented without editing for airtime or objectionable content and without commercial advertising (a structure similar to the distribution method of [[Starz Encore]]). The channel also reportedly sought a monthly license fee of $1 to $1.50 per subscriber from prospective providers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sticker Shock for Startup|url=http://www.multichannel.com/|author=Linda Moss|periodical=[[Multichannel News]]|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=September 15, 2008|accessdate=February 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106161145/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-185030184.html|archivedate=November 6, 2012}}</ref> Epix reached its first carriage agreement on July 28, 2009, when it signed a deal with [[Verizon FiOS]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Epix lands first carriage deal|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/epix-lands-carriage-deal-86976|author=Georg Szalai|agency=[[Associated Press]]|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=July 28, 2009}}</ref> In contrast, that August, two months prior to the channel's launch, three major pay television providers – cable providers Comcast and [[Cablevision]], and satellite provider [[DirecTV]] – each formally announced that they would not carry Epix. DirecTV said regarding its decision not to carry the channel: \"We think there are enough [premium channels] out there already, we don't see the value of adding another movie channel.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=DirecTV Will Pass On Epix|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/cable-operators/directv-will-pass-epix/329553|author=Mike Farrell|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=August 6, 2009}}</ref>

On August 28, 2009, Epix offered a [[free preview]] to Verizon FiOS subscribers, showing select films that would be offered by the channel upon its formal debut. During this preview, Epix added between five and seven movie selections every three days from the libraries of its three major studio backers, including the premium cable premieres of the 2008 releases ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', and ''[[Cloverfield]]''. On September 25, 2009, the channel announced plans to launch an expanded online [[video on demand]] service – to be known as the \"Epix MegaPlex\" – that began offering a minimum of 3,000 film titles beginning in the summer of 2010, in comparison to the approximately 200 titles that the basic Epix online VOD service would include in its library upon its official October 2010 launch.<ref>{{cite news|title=Epix MegaPlex to offer 3,000 shows online|url=http://www.rethinkresearch.biz/articles/epix-megaplex-to-offer-3000-shows-online/|author=Peter White|website=The Online Reporter|date=September 25, 2009|accessdate=February 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106161200/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-209479349.html|archivedate=November 6, 2012}}</ref> Epix's online offering includes over 3,000 titles for [[streaming media|streaming]], available to all subscribers through the network's [[mobile app|apps]] and Epix.com; as a result, Epix offers a wider library of movies for streaming than the combined offerings by the streaming service of its premium network competitors. The network continues to expand its VOD selection through cable, satellite and telco operators; however, it does not include more than 150 to 200 titles per month due to the bandwidth constraints of these systems.

Since its inception, Epix was among the first subscription television services to institute [[TV Everywhere]] capabilities; it was the first premium network to make its films available for streaming (beginning with the network's launch in 2009, its films were available via Epix.com), and was the first premium network to make its program content available on [[Roku]] devices, [[Xbox]] consoles, and the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Vita]] gaming devices,<ref>{{cite web|title=Epix films, programming to land on PS3 in first quarter|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10797_3-57561823-235/epix-films-programming-to-land-on-ps3-in-first-quarter/|author=Don Reisinger|website=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=January 3, 2013}}</ref> and – by way of an app released on November 7, 2013, through a distribution agreement that Studio 3 reached with [[Sony Corporation]] to release apps on its precessor consoles on January 3 of that year – [[PlayStation 4]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Epix to Launch Premium TV App on PlayStation 4|url=http://press.epixhd.com/press-releases/epix-to-launch-premium-tv-app-on-playstation4/|website=Epix Press|publisher=Studio 3 Partners, LLC|date=November 7, 2013}}</ref>

On June 2, 2014, [[Bright House Networks]] – which had its carriage agreements negotiated on their behalf by Time Warner Cable, prior to its November 2016 merger with Charter Communications – added the Epix multiplex, with all four channels being offered to its subscribers in a three-month free preview upon its initial rollout.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bright House Rolls Out Epix in SD, HD|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/distribution/bright-house-rolls-out-epix-sd-hd/374905|author=Mike Reynolds|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=NewBay Media|date=June 2, 2014|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The following month on July 14, Epix signed a multi-platform distribution agreement with [[AT&T U-verse]], in which the channel's content would be made available to subscribers through the website and apps of both Epix and U-verse, as well as on AT&T on Demand ([[AT&T]] would acquire DirecTV in 2015; however, although the company plans to unify the program lineups of its two MVPDs, it remains the only major multichannel video programming distributor that does not carry Epix).<ref>{{cite web|title=Epix Rolls Out on AT&T U-verse|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/distribution/epix-rolls-out-att-u-verse/375913|author=Mike Reynolds|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=NewBay Media|date=July 14, 2014|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> On March 4, 2014, [[Time Warner Cable]], one of the cable providers that initially declined to carry the channel, announced that it had reached an agreement with Viacom to begin carrying Epix and its multiplex channels effective March 18.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time Warner Cable Deal With Epix Rolls Out March 18|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/time-warner-cable-deal-epix-685718|author=Paul Bond|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media|Guggenheim Digital Media]]|date=March 4, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Epix signs agreement with Time Warner Cable|url=https://nypost.com/2014/03/03/epix-signs-agreement-with-time-warner-cable/|author=Claire Atkinson|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corp (2013–present)|News Corp.]]|date=March 3, 2014}}</ref>

On August 31, 2015, Epix announced that it had signed a multi-year nonexclusive licensing contract in which [[Hulu]] would obtain the partial streaming rights to its feature film content.

===MGM buyout of Paramount and Lionsgate's interests===
The future of Epix was placed into question through transactions involving Paramount Pictures and Lionsgate during the latter half of 2016.

At an investor's gathering in early January 2017, Lionsgate CEO [[Jon Feltheimer]] implied that it would explore strategic options regarding its stake in Epix – including a possible sale that would allow it to focus on Starz, of which Lionsgate completed its purchase on December 8, 2016; Feltheimer stated that Epix \"is very valuable and throwing off cash,\" and that Viacom and MGM would \"realize the value[,] which ever way we all decide is best for our companies.\" Financial analysts estimated that Epix would be valued between $1 billion and $2 billion (individually, Lionsgate's interest in the channel was valued at $458 million, MGM's interest was valued at around $277.7 million, and Viacom's interest was estimated to be worth around $739 million). On January 26, confidential sources with Studio 3 Partners confirmed to [[Reuters]] that Lionsgate had entered into discussions to sell its 31% stake in Epix to MGM and Paramount/Viacom; if a deal was reached, the two remaining partners would have become 50-50 partners in Epix.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lionsgate in talks to sell Epix stake to MGM, Viacom: sources|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lions-gate-ent-epix-idUSKBN15A2X5|author=Liana B.

On March 9, Reuters reported that MGM was in discussions to buy out the interests in Epix held by Lionsgate and Viacom (the latter of which was pursuing avenues, including the sale of non-strategic assets, to pay down its $12 billion debt load, and concentrate on restructuring Paramount Pictures and the services of Viacom Media Networks).<ref>{{cite web|title=MGM In Talks To Acquire All Of Epix From Viacom & Lionsgate|url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/epix-deal-talks-mgm-1202040482/|author=Anita Busch|author2=Patrick Hipes|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=March 9, 2017|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=MGM in Talks to Buy Out Epix Partners Lionsgate, Viacom (Report)|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/mgm-epix-viacom-lionsgate-1202005853/|periodical=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=March 9, 2017|accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Exclusive: MGM in talks to acquire entirety of Epix - sources|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-viacom-epix-sale-exclusive-idUSKBN16G35Y|author=Jessica Toonkel|author2=Liana B.

==Channels==
===List of channels===
Depending on the service provider, Epix provides up to eight multiplex channels – four 24-hour multiplex channels, all of which are simulcast in both standard definition and high definition – as well as a subscription video-on-demand service (Epix on Demand).

Two of the multiplex channels – EPIX2 and EPIX Hits – maintain less extensive distribution than that of the primary Epix channel; as such, the availability of any of the two channels varies depending on the carrier (provider availability of the multiplex channels is noted within the descriptions in the table below). Epix broadcasts its primary channel on both [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone]] schedules, while its multiplex channels are programmed solely on an Eastern Time Zone schedule.

==Programming==
===Movie library===
Epix currently has exclusive deals with major and smaller independent movie studios. {{As of|January 2014}}, films featured on the channel primarily include recent releases and film library content from the network's three original corporate parents: ViacomCBS-owned [[Paramount Pictures]] (along with film content from its subsidiaries [[Paramount Vantage]], [[Insurge Pictures]], [[MTV Films]] and [[Nickelodeon Movies]]), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (along with content from subsidiary [[United Artists]]) and [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] (along with content from subsidiaries [[Summit Entertainment]], [[Mandate Pictures]] and [[Pantelion Films]]), as well as feature films from [[Samuel Goldwyn Films]]<ref name=\"EpixGoldwyn\"/> and [[Roadside Attractions]]<ref name=\"Epix Roadside\"/> (the latter of which is part-owned by Lionsgate, in conjunction with company founders Howard Cohen and Eric d'Arbeloff<ref>{{cite web|title=Lionsgate takes minority stake in Roadside Attractions|url=http://www.screendaily.com/lionsgate-takes-minority-stake-in-roadside-attractions/4033769.article|author=Jeremy Kay|website=ScreenDaily|date=July 26, 2007}}</ref>).

Although Lionsgate acquired [[Summit Entertainment]] in January 2012, that studio maintains an existing film output deal with rival HBO, which began in 2013 through an initial five-year deal covering all Summit releases through 2017; Summit renewed the HBO contract for four additional years (extending to films released through 2022) on March 1, 2016, and as such, Summit's films are also restricted from airing on the networks of Lionsgate-owned competitor Starz.<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Chief Talks HBO Now, International Expansion and Summit Output Extension|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/hbo-chief-richard-plepler-summit-entertainment-1201720758/|author=Cynthia Littleton|periodical=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> In 2020, Lionsgate's contract with Epix will expire, with that studio's first-run contract moving to [[Hulu]] and [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] for 2020-21, before moving to Starz in 2022.<ref>https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/lionsgate-hulu-fx-distribution-deal-1203240225</ref>

As of June 2019, the channel's three multiplex services – Epix 2, Epix Hits and Epix Drive-In – also offer sub-licensed movie content from the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] library (which includes films from [[Columbia Pictures]], [[TriStar Pictures]], [[Sony Pictures Classics]], [[Screen Gems]] and [[Morgan Creek Productions]], among others). (Sony also maintains a pay television licensing agreement with Starz, in effect since 2004, for the studio's recent theatrical releases.)

The window between a film's initial release in theaters and its initial airing on Epix is stated to be slightly reduced in comparison to the grace period between its theatrical release and its first pay television broadcast on either HBO/Cinemax, Showtime or Starz; as such, films will have a longer broadcast duration during their term of license agreement than is currently possible with the other major premium channels.<ref>{{cite web|title=Talking TV With Epix's Mark Greenberg|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/10/29/epix-verizon-cable-business-entertainment-greenberg.html|author=Lacey Rose|periodical=[[Forbes]]|publisher=Forbes, Inc.|date=October 30, 2009}}</ref> Epix's programming format is similar to that of the primary channel of Starz Encore, in that its schedule includes recent film releases that are interspersed with older movies released between the 1970s and the 1990s, with recently released films often scheduled alongside the older film titles during daytime and prime time slots.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Original programming===
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by Epix}}
Prior to the network's launch, Epix ordered its first original series pilot ''Tough Trade'' (to have been produced by corporate sister [[Lionsgate Television]]). The drama, created by [[Jenji Kohan]] (creator of ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'' and ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]''), was to have centered on three generations of a dysfunctional family involved in [[country music]]. The pilot was filmed in late summer 2009 in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], with the intent of being picked up to series for a 2010 debut; however, Epix declined to greenlight ''Tough Trade'' for a series order.<ref>{{cite web|title=Epix greenlights 'Tough Trade'|url=https://variety.com/2009/scene/markets-festivals/epix-greenlights-tough-trade-1117999898/|author=Cynthia Littleton|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=February 10, 2009}}</ref> The network's first original comedy special, [[Lewis Black]]'s ''Stark Raving Black'', premiered on the channel on December 5, 2009.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Laverne McKinnon (who previously served as head of drama development for [[CBS]]), resigned from her role as executive vice president of original programming and development for Epix on August 4, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Epix’s Head Of Original Programming Exits|url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/08/epixs-head-of-original-programming-exits/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=August 4, 2011}}</ref> Thereafter, Epix remained active in producing other original programming exclusively for the channel, including documentaries, sports, comedy, and music specials. On June 30, 2012, Epix launched a monthly comedy special showcase called \"EPIX Comedy Unbound\", consisting of a new special premiering on the final weekend of each month; the first special to be aired as part of the showcase was ''[[Jim Norton (American comedian)|Jim Norton]]: Please Be Offended''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Epix to Launch Monthly Comedy Showcase 'Epix Comedy Unbound'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/epix-monthly-comedy-unbound-32385|author=Georg Szalai|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Guggenheim Digital Media|date=June 28, 2012}}</ref>

In early 2015, Epix renewed its original scripted programming efforts after a four-year embargo, emphasizing development of drama series. These plans were cemented on January 12, 2015, when Epix hired Jocelyn Diaz – who, immediately prior to her appointment, had served as vice president of production at [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]], and was previously head of drama development at HBO – as its executive vice president of original programming and development.<ref>{{cite news|title=Epix movie channel to start making original dramas|url=https://nypost.com/2015/01/12/epix-movie-channel-to-make-original-dramas-under-diaz/|author=Claire Atkinson|newspaper=New York Post|publisher=News Corp.|date=January 12, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Epix Moves Into Scripted Series with HBO Alum Jocelyn Diaz|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/epix-jocelyn-diaz-executive-vice-president-original-programming-1201403877/|author=Elizabeth Wagmeister|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Guggenheim Digital Media|date=January 13, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>

On July 8 of that year, Epix announced its first original scripted project to be picked up as a series, both of which are set for a fall 2016 debut: ''[[Graves (TV series)|Graves]]'', a [[political satire]] from Lionsgate Television and creator [[Joshua Michael Stern]] (with [[Nick Nolte]] and [[Sela Ward]] toplining the show's cast), about a former American president seeking to repair the damage caused by his administration, and ''[[Berlin Station (TV series)|Berlin Station]]'', an espionage drama produced by [[Paramount Television]], about a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent's quest to uncover an information leak at the agency's [[Berlin]] office. The two series made their debuts on October 16, 2016.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|title=Epix Joining the World of Scripted TV With Two Original Series|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/21/business/media/epix-joining-the-world-of-scripted-tv-with-two-original-series.html|author=Emily Steel|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 21, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Susan Sarandon To Star In Epix Comedy ‘Graves’ Opposite Nick Nolte|url=https://deadline.com/2015/07/susan-sarandon-stars-in-epix-comedy-graves-with-nick-nolte-1201472302/|author=Erik Pedersen|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=July 8, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Susan Sarandon joins Nick Nolte in Epix series Graves|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/08/susan-sarandon-nick-nolte-graves|author=Devan Coggan|periodical=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=July 8, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref>

The network would expand its series development in May 2016, when Epix ordered a thriller comedy series based on the 1990 book and 1995 film adaptation ''[[Get Shorty]]'' – with [[Ray Romano]] tapped to headline its cast – to be produced by [[MGM Television]].<ref>{{cite web|title=‘Get Shorty’ TV Series Ordered By Epix|url=https://deadline.com/2016/05/get-shorty-tv-series-movie-epix-1201761991/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=May 26, 2016}}</ref> Subsequently, in January 2017, the network ordered the comedy pilot ''[[Picture Paris]]'' – a series adaptation of the 2011 short film written by [[Brad Hall]], who was tapped as its showrunner – straight to series; the program would mark the first major television role by [[Meg Ryan]], who was tapped as its star, since her supporting main role in the short-lived 1985 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] western series ''[[Wildside (U.S. TV series)|Wildside]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meg Ryan Books First Major TV Role in 30 Years With Epix Comedy|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/meg-ryan-epix-comedy-tv-1201951736/|author1=Oriana Schwindt|author2=Elisabeth Wagmeister|periodical=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=January 3, 2017}}</ref>

===Sports programming===
On March 19, 2011, Epix became the third premium cable channel – after HBO and Showtime – to air professional [[boxing]] events with the telecast of a heavyweight title fight between [[Vitali Klitschko]] and [[Odlanier Solis]], held in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]]. In addition to airing on the linear Epix channel, the fight was also streamed live on the channel's website.<ref>{{cite news|title=Epix joins HBO, Showtime in boxing game|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/17/AR2011031702457.html|author=Dave Skretta|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Media Group|The Washington Post Company]]|date=March 17, 2011}}</ref> The fight was the first heavyweight title event to air on American television since [[Vitali Klitschko#Klitschko vs. Arreola|Klitschko's September 2009 match]] against [[Chris Arreola]] (which aired one month prior to Epix's debut), and the first televised heavyweight championship bout since [[Vitali Klitschko#Klitschko vs. Johnson|Klitschko's December 2009 match]] against [[Kevin Johnson (boxer)|Kevin Johnson]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Klitschko-Solis A Heavyweight Fight of Epix Proportions|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/klitschko-solis-heavyweight-fight-epix-proportions--37188|author=Jake Donovan|website=Boxing Scene|date=March 19, 2011}}</ref>

Epix also serves as the broadcast rightsholder for the [[Bellator Fighting Championships]] [[mixed martial arts]] tournament, which carries its events over multiplex channel EPIX2, instead of the primary channel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bellator to simulcast fifth season in high definition on Epix|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2011/08/bellator-to-simulcast-fifth-season-in-high-definition-on-epix|website=MMAJunkie|publisher=USA Today (Gannett Company)|date=August 30, 2011}}</ref>

Beginning with the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[2014-15 NHL season|2014–15 season]] and concluding until the [[2016–17 NHL season|2016–17 season]], Epix also held the rights to broadcast [[documentary film|documentary]] series leading up to some of the league's major events, starting with the [[2015 NHL Winter Classic|2015 Winter Classic]]. This was discontinued for the [[2017–18 NHL season|2017–18 season]], when those series were moved to [[NBCSN]].

==Background==
[[Paramount Pictures]] has been involved in the pay television industry since the 1950s. From 1953 to 1961, Paramount owned [[Telemeter (pay television)|Telemeter]], an ambitious but expensive theater television system that transmitted using [[closed-circuit television|closed circuitry]] – as opposed to broadcast frequencies – over which customers could purchase broadcasts by inserting coins into a collection box.

In April 1980, Paramount (then owned by [[Gulf and Western|Gulf+Western]]), [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]/[[Universal Studios]], [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]] partnered with [[Getty Oil]] to jointly develop a pay cable service called Premiere. The proposed channel would have maintained exclusive first-run rights to newer feature films distributed by each of the studios (which would have aired nine months before to their initial telecasts on other premium channels), along with carrying films cherry-picked from other studios without any exclusivity. Displeased that the venture would likely give the four studios disproportionate control of the pay television marketplace, [[Time-Life]], [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment]] and [[Viacom (1952–2006)|Viacom]]/[[TelePrompTer Corporation|TelePrompTer]] (the then respective owners of [[HBO]], [[The Movie Channel]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]) proceeded to file an antitrust lawsuit against the studios with the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] later that year. After reviewing the case, the Justice Department issued an injunction blocking Premiere's planned January 1, 1981 launch, deeming the venture to be an illegal boycott of the existing pay services that would subject them to possible financial damage if its presence resulted in price fixing of film titles. Paramount, MCA, Fox and Columbia decided to scrap the venture after the ruling was handed down.<ref>{{cite book|title=Joint Ventures, Alliances, and Corporate Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JeY_afXHSnEC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Kathryn Rudie Harrigan|publisher=Beard Books|date=January 1, 1985|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hollywood in the Information Age: Beyond the Silver Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuuuBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Janet Wasko|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=167|date=June 26, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>

In August 1982, MCA/Universal and Gulf+Western reached an agreement with [[Warner Communications]] to each acquire 25% interests in The Movie Channel, a struggling pay service then-owned by Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, a cable television venture of Warner and [[American Express]] that would retain the remaining 25%. This proposal was driven by the studios wanting to increase revenue received from licensing their films to premium television services, and industry concerns that dominant premium service HBO would hold undue negotiating power for these rights through its acquisitions of film titles prior to their theatrical release. In January 1983, the proposal was amended to include Viacom International, which proposed to consolidate The Movie Channel  and Showtime (of which Viacom had acquired the 50% interest inherited by [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W Cable]] through its prior merger with TelePrompTer for $75 million in August 1982) into one unit. Four of the partners would respectively own 22.58% of both networks, with American Express owning the remaining 9.68%. As with the earlier Premiere proposal, the Justice Department subjected the proposal to regulatory scrutiny as Warner, Universal and Paramount received 50% of their respective total revenue from film releases and licensing fees from premium services; the 30% share that would be held by the Showtime-TMC combination would have also formed an oligopoly in the pay cable market with HBO and [[Cinemax]] (which, even with the presence of smaller competitors at the time like [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]] and [[Home Theater Network]], controlled the remaining 60% of the market).<ref>{{cite news|title=5 COMPANIES IN VENTURE TO RUN 2 PAY-TV UNITS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/08/business/5-companies-in-venture-to-run-2-pay-tv-units.html|author=Sally Bedell|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 8, 1983}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Joint Ventures, Alliances, and Corporate Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JeY_afXHSnEC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Kathryn Rudie Harrigan|publisher=Beard Books|page=167|date=January 1, 1985|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hollywood in the Information Age: Beyond the Silver Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuuuBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Janet Wasko|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|page=167|date=June 26, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>

The proposal was revised twice to address these issues and others cited by HBO executives in responses to a civil antitrust lawsuit against the Showtime-Movie Channel merger that was filed by the Justice Department on June 10, 1983. This culminated in Paramount and Universal being dropped from the partnership in the final revision submitted on July 28, 1983; Warner Communications, Viacom and Warner-Amex became the only partners remaining in the proposal, which a Justice Department memorandum cited would \"prevent any anti-competitive effect [against other premium services wishing to enter the market] from arising,\" currying the Department's formal approval of the proposal on August 13 (three weeks before it was finalized on September 6). Shortly afterward, Paramount signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Showtime, which had already maintained a licensing deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer that gave the service exclusive pay cable rights to MGM's films.<ref name=\"ParamountSues\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=MGM/UA, Showtime renew deal|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR116021/|author=Christian Moerk|author2=John Dempsey|periodical=Variety|publisher=[[Fairchild Publications]]|date=November 22, 1993|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref>

Both of Showtime's tenures with Paramount ended in acrimony. In the spring of 1989, Paramount struck an exclusive licensing agreement with HBO; subsequently that May, Paramount filed a lawsuit against [[Showtime Networks]], its parent Viacom, and the corporate parent of both entities, [[National Amusements]] over Showtime's alleged refusal to pay a total of $88 million in fees for five films – all of which had underperformed in their theatrical release – to reduce the minimum liability for its 75-film package from the studio.<ref name=\"ParamountSues\">{{cite news|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Paramount Sues Viacom Over Fees|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/12/business/the-media-business-paramount-sues-viacom-over-fees.html|author=Geraldine Fabrikant|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 12, 1989|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref> Showtime regained first-run pay cable rights to Paramount's films through a seven-year distribution deal signed in May 1995, in a byproduct of Viacom's merger with Paramount Pictures parent [[Paramount Communications]] the year prior; this agreement gave the services of Showtime Networks – Showtime, The Movie Channel and [[Flix (TV network)|Flix]] – exclusive rights to all films released by the studio from 1997 onward starting in January 1998, following the expiration of Paramount's contract with HBO.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Showtime Networks (SNI) and Paramount Pictures announce exclusive output deal|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Showtime+Networks+%28SNI%29+and+Paramount+Pictures+announce+exclusive...-a016877979|agency=[[Business Wire]]|via=The Free Library|date=May 18, 1995|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>

The formation of Epix was announced on April 21, 2008, after individual negotiations between Paramount Pictures, MGM, and Lionsgate with Showtime to renew their existing film output deals broke down; each of the three studios disagreed with Showtime over the licensing fee rates for which they wanted Showtime to compensate them to allow future releases to air on the Showtime Networks services.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paramount set to end movie sales to Showtime|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-151760313.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106161113/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-151760313.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=Tim Arango|newspaper=[[International New York Times|International Herald Tribune]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=April 22, 2008|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> In December 2008, the three studios – which named their jointly owned [[holding company]] for the channel, Studio 3 Partners – selected the name \"Epix\" for their premium linear television and on-demand service; the partnership formally announced the launch of Epix at the [[National Association of Television Program Executives]] (NATPE) Convention on January 27, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=NATPE 2009: Studio 3’s New Net Will Be Epix|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/syndication-and-distribution/natpe-2009-studio-3%E2%80%99s-new-net-will-be-epix/50779|author=Paige Albiniak|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=January 27, 2009|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}</ref> Mark Greenberg – who previously served as a marketing executive at HBO, [[executive vice president]] of Showtime, and managing director of management and consulting firm MSCGI (whose clients included [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Entertainment]], [[Comcast]] and Lionsgate) – created the business plan and strategy, then partnered with the Lionsgate/MGM/Paramount consortium to build and launch the network.

The network would focus on both recent feature films from Paramount (specifically those released after 2008), MGM/United Artists and Lionsgate (consisting of films released by each studio from 2009 onward) as well as library content from each of the studios. Within weeks of its October 2009 launch, Epix signed an exclusive first-run film content agreements with two additional studios: one with [[Samuel Goldwyn Films]] to broadcast a package of 20 recent and forthcoming theatrical movies from the studio,<ref>{{cite web|title=Goldywn Inks With Upstart Epix|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/wires/2009/08/06/goldywn-inks-with-upstart_ws_252490.html|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|publisher=The Huffington Post Media Group|via=[[IndieWire]]|date=August 6, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"EpixGoldwyn\">{{cite news|title=Epix Pay Channel To Show Samuel Goldwyn Films|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/34498/epix-pay-channel-to-show-samuel-goldwyn-films|author=Ryan Nakashima|agency=[[Associated Press]]|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheck Media|date=August 6, 2009|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> and another to carry a package of 22 recent and forthcoming featur films from independent film studio [[Roadside Attractions]] (of which Lions Gate Entertainment had acquired a 45% minority interest in July 2007).<ref>ref name=\"Epix Roadside\">{{cite web|title=Epix drives to Roadside Attractions|url=https://variety.com/2009/scene/markets-festivals/epix-drives-to-roadside-attractions-1118007991/|author=Cynthia Littleton|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=September 2, 2009|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> Studio 3 Partners chose the Viacom subdivision MTV Networks (later renamed Viacom Media Networks in January 2011, now known as [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks]] since the 2019 Viacom-CBS merger) to provide operational support, marketing services and affiliate distribution for the channel.<ref name=mp/>

Though Epix was first announced by Studio 3 Partners as strictly a premium service, it eventually began to seek distribution as a hybrid premium/digital basic channel, although its programming would be presented without editing for airtime or objectionable content and without commercial advertising (a structure similar to the distribution method of [[Starz Encore]]). The channel also reportedly sought a monthly license fee of $1 to $1.50 per subscriber from prospective providers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sticker Shock for Startup|url=http://www.multichannel.com/|author=Linda Moss|periodical=[[Multichannel News]]|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=September 15, 2008|accessdate=February 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106161145/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-185030184.html|archivedate=November 6, 2012}}</ref> Epix reached its first carriage agreement on July 28, 2009, when it signed a deal with [[Verizon FiOS]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Epix lands first carriage deal|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/epix-lands-carriage-deal-86976|author=Georg Szalai|agency=[[Associated Press]]|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=July 28, 2009}}</ref> In contrast, that August, two months prior to the channel's launch, three major pay television providers – cable providers Comcast and [[Cablevision]], and satellite provider [[DirecTV]] – each formally announced that they would not carry Epix. DirecTV said regarding its decision not to carry the channel: \"We think there are enough [premium channels] out there already, we don't see the value of adding another movie channel.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=DirecTV Will Pass On Epix|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/cable-operators/directv-will-pass-epix/329553|author=Mike Farrell|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=August 6, 2009}}</ref>

On August 28, 2009, Epix offered a [[free preview]] to Verizon FiOS subscribers, showing select films that would be offered by the channel upon its formal debut. During this preview, Epix added between five and seven movie selections every three days from the libraries of its three major studio backers, including the premium cable premieres of the 2008 releases ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', and ''[[Cloverfield]]''. On September 25, 2009, the channel announced plans to launch an expanded online [[video on demand]] service – to be known as the \"Epix MegaPlex\" – that began offering a minimum of 3,000 film titles beginning in the summer of 2010, in comparison to the approximately 200 titles that the basic Epix online VOD service would include in its library upon its official October 2010 launch.<ref>{{cite news|title=Epix MegaPlex to offer 3,000 shows online|url=http://www.rethinkresearch.biz/articles/epix-megaplex-to-offer-3000-shows-online/|author=Peter White|website=The Online Reporter|date=September 25, 2009|accessdate=February 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106161200/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-209479349.html|archivedate=November 6, 2012}}</ref> Epix's online offering includes over 3,000 titles for [[streaming media|streaming]], available to all subscribers through the network's [[mobile app|apps]] and Epix.com; as a result, Epix offers a wider library of movies for streaming than the combined offerings by the streaming service of its premium network competitors. The network continues to expand its VOD selection through cable, satellite and telco operators; however, it does not include more than 150 to 200 titles per month due to the bandwidth constraints of these systems.

Since its inception, Epix was among the first subscription television services to institute [[TV Everywhere]] capabilities; it was the first premium network to make its films available for streaming (beginning with the network's launch in 2009, its films were available via Epix.com), and was the first premium network to make its program content available on [[Roku]] devices, [[Xbox]] consoles, and the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Vita]] gaming devices,<ref>{{cite web|title=Epix films, programming to land on PS3 in first quarter|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10797_3-57561823-235/epix-films-programming-to-land-on-ps3-in-first-quarter/|author=Don Reisinger|website=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=January 3, 2013}}</ref> and – by way of an app released on November 7, 2013, through a distribution agreement that Studio 3 reached with [[Sony Corporation]] to release apps on its precessor consoles on January 3 of that year – [[PlayStation 4]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Epix to Launch Premium TV App on PlayStation 4|url=http://press.epixhd.com/press-releases/epix-to-launch-premium-tv-app-on-playstation4/|website=Epix Press|publisher=Studio 3 Partners, LLC|date=November 7, 2013}}</ref>

On June 2, 2014, [[Bright House Networks]] – which had its carriage agreements negotiated on their behalf by Time Warner Cable, prior to its November 2016 merger with Charter Communications – added the Epix multiplex, with all four channels being offered to its subscribers in a three-month free preview upon its initial rollout.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bright House Rolls Out Epix in SD, HD|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/distribution/bright-house-rolls-out-epix-sd-hd/374905|author=Mike Reynolds|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=NewBay Media|date=June 2, 2014|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The following month on July 14, Epix signed a multi-platform distribution agreement with [[AT&T U-verse]], in which the channel's content would be made available to subscribers through the website and apps of both Epix and U-verse, as well as on AT&T on Demand ([[AT&T]] would acquire DirecTV in 2015; however, although the company plans to unify the program lineups of its two MVPDs, it remains the only major multichannel video programming distributor that does not carry Epix).<ref>{{cite web|title=Epix Rolls Out on AT&T U-verse|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/distribution/epix-rolls-out-att-u-verse/375913|author=Mike Reynolds|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=NewBay Media|date=July 14, 2014|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> On March 4, 2014, [[Time Warner Cable]], one of the cable providers that initially declined to carry the channel, announced that it had reached an agreement with Viacom to begin carrying Epix and its multiplex channels effective March 18.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time Warner Cable Deal With Epix Rolls Out March 18|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/time-warner-cable-deal-epix-685718|author=Paul Bond|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media|Guggenheim Digital Media]]|date=March 4, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Epix signs agreement with Time Warner Cable|url=https://nypost.com/2014/03/03/epix-signs-agreement-with-time-warner-cable/|author=Claire Atkinson|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corp (2013–present)|News Corp.]]|date=March 3, 2014}}</ref>

On August 31, 2015, Epix announced that it had signed a multi-year nonexclusive licensing contract in which [[Hulu]] would obtain the partial streaming rights to its feature film content. As a consequence of this agreement, Netflix announced that it would not renew its licensing agreement with Epix; all films from Epix that were made available on Netflix's streaming queue through the preceding agreement were removed when the contract expired at the end of September.<ref>{{cite news|title=Epix Reaches Multiyear Hulu Deal, Ends Netflix Agreement|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/epix-reaches-multiyear-hulu-deal-ends-netflix-agreement-n418761|agency=Associated Press|website=[[NBC News]]|date=August 31, 2015}}</ref>

On May 5, 2019, Epix and AT&T announced that Epix would be added to DirecTV effective May 19, making the satellite provider the last major American pay television provider to begin offering the service. The agreement also stated that Epix would be available on companion virtual MVPD service [[AT&T TV Now|DirecTV Now]], albeit with no firm date set at the time for its addition to that platform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://press.epix.com/epix-and-att-reach-distribution-agreement/|title=EPIX AND AT&T REACH DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT|date=2019-05-08|website=EPIX Press Site|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-08}}</ref>

===MGM buyout of Paramount and Lionsgate's interests===
The future of Epix was placed into question through transactions involving Paramount Pictures and Lionsgate during the latter half of 2016.

At an investor's gathering in early January 2017, Lionsgate CEO [[Jon Feltheimer]] implied that it would explore strategic options regarding its stake in Epix – including a possible sale that would allow it to focus on Starz, of which Lionsgate completed its purchase on December 8, 2016; Feltheimer stated that Epix \"is very valuable and throwing off cash,\" and that Viacom and MGM would \"realize the value[,] which ever way we all decide is best for our companies.\" Financial analysts estimated that Epix would be valued between $1 billion and $2 billion (individually, Lionsgate's interest in the channel was valued at $458 million, MGM's interest was valued at around $277.7 million, and Viacom's interest was estimated to be worth around $739 million). On January 26, confidential sources with Studio 3 Partners confirmed to [[Reuters]] that Lionsgate had entered into discussions to sell its 31% stake in Epix to MGM and Paramount/Viacom; if a deal was reached, the two remaining partners would have become 50-50 partners in Epix.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lionsgate in talks to sell Epix stake to MGM, Viacom: sources|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lions-gate-ent-epix-idUSKBN15A2X5|author=Liana B.

On March 9, Reuters reported that MGM was in discussions to buy out the interests in Epix held by Lionsgate and Viacom (the latter of which was pursuing avenues, including the sale of non-strategic assets, to pay down its $12 billion debt load, and concentrate on restructuring Paramount Pictures and the services of Viacom Media Networks).<ref>{{cite web|title=MGM In Talks To Acquire All Of Epix From Viacom & Lionsgate|url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/epix-deal-talks-mgm-1202040482/|author=Anita Busch|author2=Patrick Hipes|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=March 9, 2017|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=MGM in Talks to Buy Out Epix Partners Lionsgate, Viacom (Report)|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/mgm-epix-viacom-lionsgate-1202005853/|periodical=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=March 9, 2017|accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Exclusive: MGM in talks to acquire entirety of Epix - sources|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-viacom-epix-sale-exclusive-idUSKBN16G35Y|author=Jessica Toonkel|author2=Liana B.

==Channels==
===List of channels===
Depending on the service provider, Epix provides up to eight multiplex channels – four 24-hour multiplex channels, all of which are simulcast in both standard definition and high definition – as well as a subscription video-on-demand service (Epix on Demand).

Two of the multiplex channels – EPIX2 and EPIX Hits – maintain less extensive distribution than that of the primary Epix channel; as such, the availability of any of the two channels varies depending on the carrier (provider availability of the multiplex channels is noted within the descriptions in the table below). Epix broadcasts its primary channel on both [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone]] schedules, while its multiplex channels are programmed solely on an Eastern Time Zone schedule.

==Programming==
===Movie library===
Epix currently has exclusive deals with major and smaller independent movie studios. {{As of|January 2014}}, films featured on the channel primarily include recent releases and film library content from the network's three original corporate parents: ViacomCBS-owned [[Paramount Pictures]] (along with film content from its subsidiaries [[Paramount Vantage]], [[Insurge Pictures]], [[MTV Films]] and [[Nickelodeon Movies]]), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (along with content from subsidiary [[United Artists]]) and [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] (along with content from subsidiaries [[Summit Entertainment]], [[Mandate Pictures]] and [[Pantelion Films]]), as well as feature films from [[Samuel Goldwyn Films]]<ref name=\"EpixGoldwyn\"/> and [[Roadside Attractions]]<ref name=\"Epix Roadside\"/> (the latter of which is part-owned by Lionsgate, in conjunction with company founders Howard Cohen and Eric d'Arbeloff<ref>{{cite web|title=Lionsgate takes minority stake in Roadside Attractions|url=http://www.screendaily.com/lionsgate-takes-minority-stake-in-roadside-attractions/4033769.article|author=Jeremy Kay|website=ScreenDaily|date=July 26, 2007}}</ref>).

Although Lionsgate acquired [[Summit Entertainment]] in January 2012, that studio maintains an existing film output deal with rival HBO, which began in 2013 through an initial five-year deal covering all Summit releases through 2017; Summit renewed the HBO contract for four additional years (extending to films released through 2022) on March 1, 2016, and as such, Summit's films are also restricted from airing on the networks of Lionsgate-owned competitor Starz.<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Chief Talks HBO Now, International Expansion and Summit Output Extension|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/hbo-chief-richard-plepler-summit-entertainment-1201720758/|author=Cynthia Littleton|periodical=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> In 2020, Lionsgate's contract with Epix will expire, with that studio's first-run contract moving to [[Hulu]] and [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] for 2020-21, before moving to Starz in 2022.<ref>https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/lionsgate-hulu-fx-distribution-deal-1203240225</ref>

As of June 2019, the channel's three multiplex services – Epix 2, Epix Hits and Epix Drive-In – also offer sub-licensed movie content from the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] library (which includes films from [[Columbia Pictures]], [[TriStar Pictures]], [[Sony Pictures Classics]], [[Screen Gems]] and [[Morgan Creek Productions]], among others). (Sony also maintains a pay television licensing agreement with Starz, in effect since 2004, for the studio's recent theatrical releases.)

The window between a film's initial release in theaters and its initial airing on Epix is stated to be slightly reduced in comparison to the grace period between its theatrical release and its first pay television broadcast on either HBO/Cinemax, Showtime or Starz; as such, films will have a longer broadcast duration during their term of license agreement than is currently possible with the other major premium channels.<ref>{{cite web|title=Talking TV With Epix's Mark Greenberg|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/10/29/epix-verizon-cable-business-entertainment-greenberg.html|author=Lacey Rose|periodical=[[Forbes]]|publisher=Forbes, Inc.|date=October 30, 2009}}</ref> Epix's programming format is similar to that of the primary channel of Starz Encore, in that its schedule includes recent film releases that are interspersed with older movies released between the 1970s and the 1990s, with recently released films often scheduled alongside the older film titles during daytime and prime time slots.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Original programming===
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by Epix}}
Prior to the network's launch, Epix ordered its first original series pilot ''Tough Trade'' (to have been produced by corporate sister [[Lionsgate Television]]). The drama, created by [[Jenji Kohan]] (creator of ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'' and ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]''), was to have centered on three generations of a dysfunctional family involved in [[country music]]. The pilot was filmed in late summer 2009 in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], with the intent of being picked up to series for a 2010 debut; however, Epix declined to greenlight ''Tough Trade'' for a series order.<ref>{{cite web|title=Epix greenlights 'Tough Trade'|url=https://variety.com/2009/scene/markets-festivals/epix-greenlights-tough-trade-1117999898/|author=Cynthia Littleton|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=February 10, 2009}}</ref> The network's first original comedy special, [[Lewis Black]]'s ''Stark Raving Black'', premiered on the channel on December 5, 2009.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Laverne McKinnon (who previously served as head of drama development for [[CBS]]), resigned from her role as executive vice president of original programming and development for Epix on August 4, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Epix’s Head Of Original Programming Exits|url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/08/epixs-head-of-original-programming-exits/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=August 4, 2011}}</ref> Thereafter, Epix remained active in producing other original programming exclusively for the channel, including documentaries, sports, comedy, and music specials. On June 30, 2012, Epix launched a monthly comedy special showcase called \"EPIX Comedy Unbound\", consisting of a new special premiering on the final weekend of each month; the first special to be aired as part of the showcase was ''[[Jim Norton (American comedian)|Jim Norton]]: Please Be Offended''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Epix to Launch Monthly Comedy Showcase 'Epix Comedy Unbound'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/epix-monthly-comedy-unbound-32385|author=Georg Szalai|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Guggenheim Digital Media|date=June 28, 2012}}</ref>

In early 2015, Epix renewed its original scripted programming efforts after a four-year embargo, emphasizing development of drama series. These plans were cemented on January 12, 2015, when Epix hired Jocelyn Diaz – who, immediately prior to her appointment, had served as vice president of production at [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]], and was previously head of drama development at HBO – as its executive vice president of original programming and development.<ref>{{cite news|title=Epix movie channel to start making original dramas|url=https://nypost.com/2015/01/12/epix-movie-channel-to-make-original-dramas-under-diaz/|author=Claire Atkinson|newspaper=New York Post|publisher=News Corp.|date=January 12, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Epix Moves Into Scripted Series with HBO Alum Jocelyn Diaz|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/epix-jocelyn-diaz-executive-vice-president-original-programming-1201403877/|author=Elizabeth Wagmeister|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Guggenheim Digital Media|date=January 13, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>

On July 8 of that year, Epix announced its first original scripted project to be picked up as a series, both of which are set for a fall 2016 debut: ''[[Graves (TV series)|Graves]]'', a [[political satire]] from Lionsgate Television and creator [[Joshua Michael Stern]] (with [[Nick Nolte]] and [[Sela Ward]] toplining the show's cast), about a former American president seeking to repair the damage caused by his administration, and ''[[Berlin Station (TV series)|Berlin Station]]'', an espionage drama produced by [[Paramount Television]], about a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent's quest to uncover an information leak at the agency's [[Berlin]] office. The two series made their debuts on October 16, 2016.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|title=Epix Joining the World of Scripted TV With Two Original Series|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/21/business/media/epix-joining-the-world-of-scripted-tv-with-two-original-series.html|author=Emily Steel|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 21, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Susan Sarandon To Star In Epix Comedy ‘Graves’ Opposite Nick Nolte|url=https://deadline.com/2015/07/susan-sarandon-stars-in-epix-comedy-graves-with-nick-nolte-1201472302/|author=Erik Pedersen|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=July 8, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Susan Sarandon joins Nick Nolte in Epix series Graves|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/08/susan-sarandon-nick-nolte-graves|author=Devan Coggan|periodical=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=July 8, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref>

The network would expand its series development in May 2016, when Epix ordered a thriller comedy series based on the 1990 book and 1995 film adaptation ''[[Get Shorty]]'' – with [[Ray Romano]] tapped to headline its cast – to be produced by [[MGM Television]].<ref>{{cite web|title=‘Get Shorty’ TV Series Ordered By Epix|url=https://deadline.com/2016/05/get-shorty-tv-series-movie-epix-1201761991/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=May 26, 2016}}</ref> Subsequently, in January 2017, the network ordered the comedy pilot ''[[Picture Paris]]'' – a series adaptation of the 2011 short film written by [[Brad Hall]], who was tapped as its showrunner – straight to series; the program would mark the first major television role by [[Meg Ryan]], who was tapped as its star, since her supporting main role in the short-lived 1985 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] western series ''[[Wildside (U.S. TV series)|Wildside]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meg Ryan Books First Major TV Role in 30 Years With Epix Comedy|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/meg-ryan-epix-comedy-tv-1201951736/|author1=Oriana Schwindt|author2=Elisabeth Wagmeister|periodical=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=January 3, 2017}}</ref>

===Sports programming===
On March 19, 2011, Epix became the third premium cable channel – after HBO and Showtime – to air professional [[boxing]] events with the telecast of a heavyweight title fight between [[Vitali Klitschko]] and [[Odlanier Solis]], held in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]]. In addition to airing on the linear Epix channel, the fight was also streamed live on the channel's website.<ref>{{cite news|title=Epix joins HBO, Showtime in boxing game|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/17/AR2011031702457.html|author=Dave Skretta|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Media Group|The Washington Post Company]]|date=March 17, 2011}}</ref> The fight was the first heavyweight title event to air on American television since [[Vitali Klitschko#Klitschko vs. Arreola|Klitschko's September 2009 match]] against [[Chris Arreola]] (which aired one month prior to Epix's debut), and the first televised heavyweight championship bout since [[Vitali Klitschko#Klitschko vs. Johnson|Klitschko's December 2009 match]] against [[Kevin Johnson (boxer)|Kevin Johnson]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Klitschko-Solis A Heavyweight Fight of Epix Proportions|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/klitschko-solis-heavyweight-fight-epix-proportions--37188|author=Jake Donovan|website=Boxing Scene|date=March 19, 2011}}</ref>

Epix also serves as the broadcast rightsholder for the [[Bellator Fighting Championships]] [[mixed martial arts]] tournament, which carries its events over multiplex channel EPIX2, instead of the primary channel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bellator to simulcast fifth season in high definition on Epix|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2011/08/bellator-to-simulcast-fifth-season-in-high-definition-on-epix|website=MMAJunkie|publisher=USA Today (Gannett Company)|date=August 30, 2011}}</ref>

Beginning with the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[2014-15 NHL season|2014–15 season]] and concluding until the [[2016–17 NHL season|2016–17 season]], Epix also held the rights to broadcast [[documentary film|documentary]] series leading up to some of the league's major events, starting with the [[2015 NHL Winter Classic|2015 Winter Classic]]. This was discontinued for the [[2017–18 NHL season|2017–18 season]], when those series were moved to [[NBCSN]].

The '''Council for Mutual Economic Assistance''' ({{Lang-rus|Сове́т Экономи́ческой Взаимопо́мощи|r=Sovét Ekonomícheskoy Vzaimopómoshchi}}, {{Lang|ru|СЭВ|r='''SEV'''}}; English abbreviation <small>'''COMECON'''</small>, <small>'''CMEA'''</small>, <small>'''CEMA'''</small>, or <small>'''CAME'''</small>) was an economic organization from 1949 to 1991 under the leadership of the [[Soviet Union]] that comprised the countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]] along with a number of [[socialist state]]s elsewhere in the world.<ref>Michael C. Kaser, ''Comecon: Integration problems of the planned economies'' (Oxford University Press, 1967).</ref>

The descriptive term was often applied to all multilateral activities involving members of the organization, rather than being restricted to the direct functions of Comecon and its organs.<ref>For example, this is the usage in the [[United States Library of Congress|Library of Congress]] [[Library of Congress Country Studies|Country Study]] that is heavily cited in the present article.</ref> This usage was sometimes extended as well to bilateral relations among members because in the system of Communist international economic relations, multilateral accords{{snd}} typically of a general nature{{snd}} tended to be implemented through a set of more detailed, bilateral agreements.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

Moscow was concerned about the [[Marshall Plan]]. Comecon was meant to prevent countries in the [[Soviet sphere of influence]] from moving towards that of the Americans and South-East Asia. Comecon was the Eastern Bloc's response to the formation in Western Europe of the Marshall Plan and the OEEC, which later became the [[OECD]].<ref name=\"loc-cs\">\"Germany (East)\", Library of Congress Country Study, [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html Appendix B: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501075842/http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html |date=2009-05-01 }}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of the Comecon}}
[[File:Ex-Comecon building, 2009-06-22.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Former Comecon headquarters in Moscow.]]

===Foundation===
The Comecon was founded in 1949 by the [[Soviet Union]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]. The primary factors in Comecon's formation appear to have been [[Joseph Stalin]]'s desire to cooperate and strengthen the international relationships at an economic level with the smaller states of Central Europe,<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /> and which were now, increasingly, cut off from their traditional markets and suppliers in the rest of Europe.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 536\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 536.</ref> Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland had remained interested in Marshall aid despite the requirements for a [[convertible currency]] and [[market economy|market economies]]. These requirements, which would inevitably have resulted in stronger economic ties to free European markets than to the Soviet Union, were unacceptable to Stalin, who in July 1947, ordered these communist-dominated governments to pull out of the Paris Conference on the European Recovery Programme. This has been described as \"the moment of truth\" in the post-[[World War II]] division of Europe.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 534–35.</ref> According to the Soviet view the \"Anglo-American bloc\" and \"American monopolists ... whose interests had nothing in common with those of the European people\" had spurned East-West collaboration within the framework agreed within the United Nations, that is, through the Economic Commission for Europe.<ref>Kaser, 1967, pp. 9–10.</ref>

As always, Stalin's precise motives are \"inscrutable\"<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 535\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 535.</ref> They may well have been \"more negative than positive\", with Stalin \"more anxious to keep other powers out of neighbouring [[buffer state]]s… than to integrate them.\"<ref>W. Wallace and R. Clarke, ''Comecon, Trade, and [[Western World|the West]]'', London: Pinter (1986), p. 1, quoted by Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 536.</ref> Furthermore, [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]]'s notion of ostensibly nondiscriminatory treatment of trade partners was thought to be incompatible with notions of [[socialism|socialist]] solidarity.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 536\"/> In any event, proposals for a [[customs union]] and economic integration of Central and Eastern Europe date back at least to the [[Revolutions of 1848]] (although many earlier proposals had been intended to stave off the Russian and/or communist \"menace\")<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 536\"/> and the state-to-state trading inherent in centrally planned economies required some sort of coordination: otherwise, a [[monopoly|monopolist]] seller would face a [[monopsony|monopsonist]] buyer, with no structure to set prices.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 536–37.</ref>

Comecon was established at a Moscow economic conference January 5–8, 1949, at which the six founding member countries were represented; its foundation was publicly announced on January 25; [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] joined a month later and [[East Germany]] in 1950.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 535\"/>

Recent research by the Romanian researcher Elena Dragomir suggests that Romania played a rather important role in the Comecon's creation in 1949. Dragomir argues that Romania was interested in the creation of a “system of cooperation” to improve its trade relations with the other people's democracies, especially with those able to export industrial equipment and machinery to Romania.<ref>Elena Dragomir, ‘The formation of the Soviet bloc’s Council for Mutual Economic Assistance: Romania’s involvement’, Journal Cold War Studies, xiv (2012), 34–47.http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/JCWS_a_00190#.VQKof9KsX65.</ref> According to Dragomir, in December 1948, the Romanian leader [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] sent a letter to Stalin, proposing the creation of the Comecon.<ref>Elena Dragomir, 'The creation of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance as seen from the Romanian Archives', in ''Historical Research'', September 2014. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2281.12083/abstract.</ref>
{{confusing|date=December 2016}}
At first, planning seemed to be moving along rapidly. After pushing aside [[Nikolai Voznesensky]]'s [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]]ic, price-based approach (see further discussion [[#How Comecon exchanges worked|below]]), the direction appeared to be toward a coordination of national economic plans, but with no coercive authority from Comecon itself. All decisions would require unanimous ratification, and even then governments would separately translate these into policy.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 539–41.</ref> Then in summer 1950, probably unhappy with the favorable implications for the effective individual and collective [[sovereignty]] of the smaller states, Stalin \"seems to have taken [Comecon's] personnel by surprise,\"{{clarify|date=December 2016}} bringing operations to a nearly complete halt, as the Soviet Union moved domestically toward [[autarky]] and internationally toward an \"embassy system of meddling in other countries' affairs directly\" rather than by \"constitutional means\"{{clarify|date=December 2016}}. Comecon's scope was officially limited in November 1950 to \"practical questions of facilitating trade.\"{{clarify|date=December 2016}}<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 541–42.</ref>

One important legacy of this brief period of activity was the [[Sofia principle]], adopted at the August 1949 Comecon council session in Bulgaria. This radically weakened [[intellectual property]] rights, making each country's technologies available to the others for a nominal charge that did little more than cover the cost of documentation. This, naturally, benefited the less industrialized Comecon countries, and especially the technologically lagging Soviet Union, at the expense of East Germany and Czechoslovakia and, to a lesser extent, Hungary and Poland. (This principle would weaken after 1968, as it became clear that it discouraged new research—and as the Soviet Union itself began to have more marketable technologies.)<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 542\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 542–43.</ref>

===Khrushchev era===
After Stalin's death in 1953, Comecon again began to find its footing. In the early 1950s, all Comecon countries had adopted relatively [[Autarky|autarkic]] policies; now they began again to discuss developing complementary specialties, and in 1956, ten permanent standing committees arose, intended to facilitate coordination in these matters. The Soviet Union began to trade [[petroleum|oil]] for Comecon manufactured goods. There was much discussion of coordinating [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plan]]s.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 542\"/>

However, once again, trouble arose. The [[Poznań 1956 protests|Polish protests]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian uprising]] led to major social and economic changes, including the 1957 abandonment of the [[Five-Year Plan (USSR)#Sixth Plan, 1956–1960|1956–60 Soviet five-year plan]], as the Comecon governments struggled to reestablish their legitimacy and popular support.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 543–34.</ref> The next few years saw a series of small steps toward increased trade and economic integration, including the introduction of the \"{{ill|convertible rouble|ru|Переводный рубль}}\", revised efforts at national specialization, and a 1959 charter modeled after the 1957 [[Treaty of Rome]].<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 544\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 544.</ref>

Once again, efforts at transnational [[economic planning|central planning]] failed. In December 1961, a council session approved the Basic Principles of the International Socialist Division of Labour, which talked of closer coordination of plans and of \"concentrating production of similar products in one or several socialist countries.\" In November 1962, Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] followed this up with a call for \"a common single planning organ.\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 559.</ref> This was resisted by Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland, but most emphatically by increasingly nationalistic Romania, which strongly rejected the notion that they should specialize in agriculture.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 560.</ref> In Central and Eastern Europe, only Bulgaria happily took on an assigned role (also agricultural, but in Bulgaria's case this had been the country's chosen direction even as an independent country in the 1930s).<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 553.</ref> Essentially, by the time the Soviet Union was calling for tight economic integration, they no longer had the power to impose it. Despite some slow headway—integration increased in petroleum, electricity, and other technical/scientific sectors—and the 1963 founding of an International Bank for Economic Co-operation, Comecon countries all increased trade with [[Western World|the West]] relatively more than with one another.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 560–61.</ref>

===Brezhnev era===
From its founding until 1967, Comecon had operated only on the basis of unanimous agreements. It had become increasingly obvious that the result was usually failure. In 1967, Comecon adopted the \"interested party principle\", under which any country could opt out of any project they chose, still allowing the other member states to use Comecon mechanisms to coordinate their activities. In principle, a country could still veto, but the hope was that they would typically choose just to step aside rather than either veto or be a reluctant participant.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 561.</ref> This aimed, at least in part, at allowing Romania to chart its own economic course without leaving Comecon entirely or bringing it to an impasse.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 566.</ref>

Also until the late 1960s, the official term for Comecon activities was ''cooperation''. The term ''integration'' was always avoided because of its connotations of monopolistic capitalist collusion. After the \"special\" council session of April 1969 and the development and adoption (in 1971) of the Comprehensive Program for the Further Extension and Improvement of Cooperation and the Further Development of Socialist Economic Integration by Comecon Member Countries, Comecon activities were officially termed ''integration'' (equalization of \"differences in relative scarcities of goods and services between states through the deliberate elimination of barriers to trade and other forms of interaction\"). Although such equalization had not been a pivotal point in the formation and implementation of Comecon's economic policies, improved economic integration had always been Comecon's goal.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /><ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 564, 566.</ref>

While such integration was to remain a goal, and while Bulgaria became yet more tightly integrated with the Soviet Union, progress in this direction was otherwise continually frustrated by the national central planning prevalent in all Comecon countries, by the increasing diversity of its members (which by this time included Mongolia and would soon include Cuba) and by the \"overwhelming asymmetry\" and resulting distrust between the many small member states and the Soviet \"superstate\" which, in 1983, \"accounted for 88 percent of Comecon's territory and 60 percent of its population.\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 564.</ref>

In this period, there were some efforts to move away from central planning, by establishing intermediate industrial associations and combines in various countries (which were often empowered to negotiate their own international deals). However, these groupings typically proved \"unwieldy, conservative, risk-averse, and bureaucratic,\" reproducing the problems they had been intended to solve.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 568\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 568–69.</ref>

One economic success of the 1970s was the development of Soviet oil fields. While doubtless \"(Central and) [[East Europeans]] resented having to defray some of the costs of developing the economy of their hated overlord and oppressor,\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 568.</ref> they benefited from low prices for fuel and other mineral products. As a result, Comecon economies generally showed strong growth in the mid-1970s. They were largely unaffected by the [[1973 oil crisis]].<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 568\"/> Another short-term economic gain in this period was that ''[[détente]]'' brought opportunities for investment and technology transfers from [[Western World|the West]]. This also led to an importation of [[Western World|Western]] cultural attitudes, especially in Central Europe. However, many undertakings based on [[Western World|Western]] technology were less than successful (for example, Poland's [[Ursus Factory|Ursus]] tractor factory did not do well with technology licensed from [[Massey Ferguson]]); other investment was wasted on luxuries for the party elite, and most Comecon countries ended up indebted to [[Western World|the West]] when capital flows died out as ''détente'' faded in the late 1970s, and from 1979 to 1983, all of Comecon experienced a recession from which (with the possible exceptions of East Germany and Bulgaria) they never recovered in the Communist era. Romania and Poland experienced major declines in the standard of living.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 571–72.</ref>

===Perestroika===
The 1985 Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Progress and the rise to power of Soviet general secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] increased Soviet influence in Comecon operations and led to attempts to give Comecon some degree of supranational authority. The Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Progress was designed to improve economic cooperation through the development of a more efficient and interconnected scientific and technical base.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /> This was the era of ''[[perestroika]]'' (\"restructuring\"), the last attempt to put the Comecon economies on a sound economic footing.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 579.</ref> Gorbachev and his economic mentor [[Abel Aganbegyan]] hoped to make \"revolutionary changes\" in the economy, foreseeing that \"science will increasingly become a 'direct productive force', as Marx foresaw… By the year 2000… the renewal of plant and machinery… will be running at 6 percent or more per year.\"<ref>Abel Aganbegyan, quoted in Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 580.</ref>

The program was not a success. \"The Gorbachev regime made too many commitments on too many fronts, thereby overstretching and overheating the Soviet economy. Bottlenecks and shortages were not relieved but exacerbated, while the (Central and) East European members of Comecon resented being asked to contribute scarce capital to projects that were chiefly of interest to the Soviet Union…\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 580.</ref> Furthermore, the liberalization that by June 25, 1988 allowed Comecon countries to negotiate trade treaties directly with the European Community (the renamed EEC), and the \"[[Sinatra doctrine]]\" under which the Soviet Union allowed that change would be the exclusive affair of each individual country marked the beginning of the end for Comecon. Although the [[Revolutions of 1989]] did not formally end Comecon, and the Soviet government itself lasted until 1991, the March 1990 meeting in Prague was little more than a formality, discussing the coordination of non-existent five-year plans. From January 1, 1991, the countries shifted their dealings with one another to a hard currency market basis. The result was a radical decrease in trade with one another, as \"(Central and) Eastern Europe… exchanged asymmetrical trade dependence on the Soviet Union for an equally asymmetrical commercial dependence on the European Community.\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 580–82; the quotation is on p. 582.</ref>

The final Comecon council session took place on June 28, 1991, in [[Budapest]], and led to an agreement to disband within 90 days.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 582.</ref> The Soviet Union itself was dismantled on December 26, 1991.

===Post-Cold War activity after Comecon===
After the fall of the Soviet Union and communist rule in Eastern Europe, [[East Germany]] (now unified with Germany) automatically joined the [[European Union]] (then the European Community) in 1990. The [[Baltic States]] ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]), [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Slovenia]] joined the EU in 2004, followed by [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] in 2007 and [[Croatia]] in 2013. To date, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany (former GDR), Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia are now members of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. All four Central European states are now members of the [[Visegrad Group]].

Russia, the successor to the Soviet Union along with [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] founded the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] which consists of the ex-Soviet republics. The country also leads the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] with [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] and the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] with [[Armenia]], Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Along with Ukraine, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Moldova]] are also part of the [[GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development|GUAM]].

[[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]] joined the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] in 1995 and 1997 respectively.

In the late 1950s, a number of communist-ruled non-member countries{{snd}} the [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]], [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]{{snd}} were invited to participate as observers in Comecon sessions. Although Mongolia and Vietnam later gained full membership, China stopped attending Comecon sessions after 1961. Yugoslavia negotiated a form of associate status in the organization, specified in its 1964 agreement with Comecon.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /> Collectively, the members of the Comecon did not display the necessary prerequisites for economic integration: their level of industrialization was low and uneven, with a single dominant member (the Soviet Union) producing 70% of the community national product.<ref>Zwass, 1989, p. 4</ref>

In the late 1980s, there were ten full members: the Soviet Union, six East European countries, and three extra-regional members. Geography, therefore, no longer united Comecon members. Wide variations in economic size and level of economic development also tended to generate divergent interests among the member countries. All these factors combined to give rise to significant differences in the member states' expectations about the benefits to be derived from membership in Comecon. Unity was provided instead by political and ideological factors. All Comecon members were \"united by a commonality of fundamental class interests and the ideology of Marxism-Leninism\" and had common approaches to economic ownership (state versus private) and management (plan versus market). In 1949 the ruling communist parties of the founding states were also linked internationally through the [[Cominform]], from which [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] [[Informbiro|had been expelled]] the previous year. Although the Cominform was disbanded in 1956, interparty links continued to be strong among Comecon members, and all participated in periodic international conferences of communist parties. Comecon provided a mechanism through which its leading member, the Soviet Union, sought to foster economic links with and among its closest political and military allies. The East European members of Comecon were also militarily allied with the Soviet Union in the [[Warsaw Pact]].<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

There were three kinds of relationships &ndash; besides the 10 full memberships &ndash; with the Comecon:

* Yugoslavia was the only country considered to have associate member status. On the basis of the 1964 agreement, Yugoslavia participated in twenty-one of the thirty-two key Comecon institutions as if it were a full member.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />
* [[Finland]], [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], [[Mexico]], and [[Nicaragua]] had a cooperant status with Comecon. Because the governments of these countries were not empowered to conclude agreements in the name of private companies, the governments did not take part in Comecon operations. They were represented in Comecon by commissions made up of members of the government and the business community. The commissions were empowered to sign various \"framework\" agreements with Comecon's Joint Commission on Cooperation.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />
* After 1956, Comecon allowed certain countries with communist or pro-Soviet governments to attend sessions as observers. In November 1986, delegations from [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[Derg|Ethiopia]], [[Laos]], and [[South Yemen]] attended the 42nd Council Session as observers.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

==Exchange==
Working with neither meaningful [[exchange rate]]s nor a market economy, Comecon countries had to look to world markets as a reference point for prices, but unlike agents acting in a market, prices tended to be stable over a period of years, rather than constantly fluctuating, which assisted central planning. Also, there was a tendency to underprice raw materials relative to the manufactured goods produced in many of the Comecon countries.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 537\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 537.</ref>

International barter helped preserve the Comecon countries' scarce [[hard currency]] reserves. In strict economic terms, barter inevitably harmed countries whose goods would have brought higher prices in the free market or whose imports could have been obtained more cheaply and benefitted those for whom it was the other way around. Still, all of the Comecon countries gained some stability, and the governments gained some legitimacy,<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 537\"/> and in many ways this stability and protection from the world market was viewed, at least in the early years of Comecon, as an advantage of the system, as was the formation of stronger ties with other socialist countries.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 538.</ref>

Within Comecon, there were occasional struggles over just how this system should work. Early on, [[Nikolai Voznesensky]] pushed for a more \"law-governed\" and [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]]ic price-based approach. However, with the August 1948 death of [[Andrei Zhdanov]], Voznesensky lost his patron and was soon accused of treason as part of the [[Leningrad Affair]]; within two years he was dead in prison. Instead, what won out was a \"physical planning\" approach that strengthened the role of central governments over technocrats.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 539\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 539.</ref> At the same time, the effort to create a single regime of planning \"common economic organization\" with the ability to set plans throughout the Comecon region also came to nought. A protocol to create such a system was signed January 18, 1949, but never ratified.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 540.</ref> While historians are not unanimous on why this was stymied, it clearly threatened the sovereignty not only of the smaller states but even of the Soviet Union itself, since an international body would have had real power; Stalin clearly preferred informal means of intervention in the other Comecon states.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 540–41.</ref> This lack of either rationality or international central planning tended to promote [[autarky]] in each Comecon country because none fully trusted the others to deliver goods and services.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 539\"/>

With few exceptions, foreign trade in the Comecon countries was a [[state monopoly]], and the state agencies and captive trading companies were often corrupt. Even at best, this tended to put several removes between a producer and any foreign customer, limiting the ability to learn to adjust to foreign customers' needs. Furthermore, there was often strong political pressure to keep the best products for domestic use in each country. From the early 1950s to Comecon's demise in the early 1990s, intra-Comecon trade, except for Soviet petroleum, was in steady decline.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 565\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 565.</ref>

===Oil transfers===
Beginning no later than the early 1970s,<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 569.</ref> Soviet petroleum and [[natural gas]] were routinely transferred within Comecon at below-market rates. Most [[Western World|Western]] commentators have viewed this as implicit, politically motivated subsidization of shaky economies to defuse discontent and reward compliance with Soviet wishes.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 570 makes the assertion about this being the dominant view, and cites several examples.</ref> Other commentators say that this may not have been deliberate policy, noting that whenever prices differ from world market prices, there will be winners and losers. They argue that this may have been simply an unforeseen consequence of two factors: the slow adjustment of Comecon prices during a time of rising oil and gas prices, and the fact that mineral resources were abundant in the Comecon sphere, relative to manufactured goods. A possible point of comparison is that there were also winners and losers under EEC agricultural policy in the same period.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 570–71.</ref> Russian and Kazakh oil kept the Comecon countries' oil prices low when the [[1973 oil crisis]] quadrupled Western oil prices.

===Ineffective production===
The organization of Comecon was officially focused on common expansion of states, more effective production and building relationships between countries within. And as in every planned economy, operations did not reflect state of market, innovations, availability of items or the specific needs of a country. One example came from former Czechoslovakia. In the 1970s, the Communist party of Czechoslovakia finally realized that there was a need for underground trains. Czechoslovak designers projected a cheap but technologically innovative underground train. The train was a state-of-the-art project, capable of moving underground or on the surface using standard rails, had a high number of passenger seats, and was lightweight. According to the designers, the train was technologically more advanced than the trains used in New York's Subway, London's Tube or the Paris Metro. However, due to the plan of Comecon, older Soviet trains were used, which guaranteed profit for the Soviet Union and work for workers in Soviet factories. That economical change lead to the cancellation of the R1 trains by A. Honzík. The Comecon plan, though more profitable for the Soviets, if less resourceful for the Czechs and Slovaks, forced the Czechoslovak government to buy trains \"Ečs (81-709)\" and \"81-71\", both of which were designed in early 1950s and were heavy, unreliable and expensive.

On the other hand, Czechoslovak trams ([[Tatra T3]]) and jet trainers ([[Aero L-29 Delfín|L-29]]) were the standard for all Comecon countries, including the USSR, and other countries could develop their own designs but only for their own needs, like Poland (respectively, [[Konstal]] trams and [[PZL TS-11 Iskra|TS-11]] jets). Poland was a manufacturer of light helicopters for Comecon countries ([[Mil Mi-2|Mi-2]] of the Soviet design). The USSR developed their own model [[Kamov Ka-26]] and Romania produced French helicopters under license for their own market. In a formal or informal way, often the countries were discouraged from developing their own designs that competed with the main Comecon design.

==Structure==

Although not formally part of the organization's hierarchy, the Conference of First Secretaries of Communist and Workers' Parties and of the Heads of Government of the Comecon Member Countries was Comecon's most important organ. These party and government leaders gathered for conference meetings regularly to discuss topics of mutual interest. Because of the rank of conference participants, their decisions had considerable influence on the actions taken by Comecon and its organs.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

The official hierarchy of Comecon consisted of the Session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the Executive Committee of the Council, the Secretariat of the Council, four council committees, twenty-four standing commissions, six interstate conferences, two scientific institutes, and several associated organizations.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

===The Session===
The Session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, officially the highest Comecon organ, examined fundamental problems of economic integration and directed the activities of the Secretariat and other subordinate organizations. Delegations from each Comecon member country attended these meetings. Prime ministers usually headed the delegations, which met during the second quarter of each year in a member country's capital (the location of the meeting was determined by a system of rotation based on [[Cyrillic script]]). All interested parties had to consider recommendations handed down by the Session. A [[treaty]] or other kind of legal agreement implemented adopted recommendations. Comecon itself might adopt decisions only on organizational and procedural matters pertaining to itself and its organs.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

Each country appointed one permanent representative to maintain relations between members and Comecon between annual meetings. An extraordinary Session, such as the one in December 1985, might be held with the consent of at least one-third of the members. Such meetings usually took place in Moscow.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

===Executive Committee===
The highest executive organ in Comecon, the Executive Committee, was entrusted with elaborating policy recommendations and supervising their implementation between sessions. In addition, it supervised work on plan coordination and scientific-technical cooperation. Composed of one representative from each member country, usually a deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers, the Executive Committee met quarterly, usually in Moscow. In 1971 and 1974, the Executive Committee acquired economic departments that ranked above the standing commissions. These economic departments considerably strengthened the authority and importance of the Executive Committee.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

===Other entities===
There were four council committees: Council Committee for Cooperation in Planning, Council Committee for Scientific and Technical Cooperation, Council Committee for Cooperation in Material and Technical Supply, and Council Committee for Cooperation in Machine Building. Their mission was \"to ensure the comprehensive examination and a multilateral settlement of the major problems of cooperation among member countries in the economy, science, and technology.\" All committees were headquartered in Moscow and usually met there. These committees advised the standing commissions, the Secretariat, the interstate conferences, and the scientific institutes in their areas of specialization. Their jurisdiction was generally wider than that of the standing commissions because they had the right to make policy recommendations to other Comecon organizations.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

The Council Committee for Cooperation in Planning was the most important of the four. It coordinated the national economic plans of Comecon members. As such, it ranked in importance only after the Session and the Executive Committee. Made up of the chairmen of Comecon members' national central planning offices, the Council Committee for Cooperation in Planning drew up draft agreements for joint projects, adopted a resolution approving these projects, and recommended approval to the concerned parties. If its decisions were not subject to approval by national governments and parties, this committee would be considered Comecon's supranational planning body.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

The international Secretariat, Comecon's only permanent body, was Comecon's primary economic research and administrative organ. The secretary, who has been a Soviet official since Comecon creation, was the official Comecon representative to Comecon member states and to other states and international organizations. Subordinate to the secretary were his deputy and the various departments of the Secretariat, which generally corresponded to the standing commissions. The Secretariat's responsibilities included preparation and organization of Comecon sessions and other meetings conducted under the auspices of Comecon; compilation of digests on Comecon activities; conduct of economic and other research for Comecon members; and preparation of recommendations on various issues concerning Comecon operations.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

In 1956, eight standing commissions were set up to help Comecon make recommendations pertaining to specific economic sectors. The commissions have been rearranged and renamed a number of times since the establishment of the first eight. In 1986 there were twenty-four standing commissions, each headquartered in the capital of a member country and headed by one of that country's leading authorities in the field addressed by the commission. The Secretariat supervised the actual operations of the commissions. The standing commissions had authority only to make recommendations, which had then to be approved by the Executive Committee, presented to the Session, and ratified by the interested member countries. Commissions usually met twice a year in Moscow.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

The six interstate conferences (on water management, internal trade, legal matters, inventions and [[patents]], pricing, and labor affairs) served as forums for discussing shared issues and experiences. They were purely consultative and generally acted in an advisory capacity to the Executive Committee or its specialized committees.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

The scientific institutes on standardization and on economic problems of the world economic system concerned themselves with theoretical problems of international cooperation. Both were headquartered in Moscow and were staffed by experts from various member countries.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

===Affiliated agencies===
[[File:Budapest, Hungary Elisabeth Bridge Medal 1974.jpg|thumb|1974 Medallion 10th Anniversary of Intermetall, that was founded in 1964 in Budapest]]

Several affiliated agencies, having a variety of relationships with Comecon, existed outside the official Comecon hierarchy. They served to develop \"direct links between appropriate bodies and organizations of Comecon member countries.\"<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

These affiliated agencies were divided into two categories: intergovernmental economic organizations (which worked on a higher level in the member countries and generally dealt with a wider range of managerial and coordinative activities) and international economic organizations (which worked closer to the operational level of research, production, or trade). A few examples of the former are the [[International Bank for Economic Cooperation]] (managed the transferable ruble system), the [[International Investment Bank]] (in charge of financing joint projects), and [[Intermetall]] (encouraged cooperation in [[ferrous metallurgy]]).<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

International economic organizations generally took the form of either joint enterprises, international economic associations or unions, or international economic partnerships. The latter included [[Interatominstrument]] (nuclear machinery producers), [[Intertekstilmash]] (textile machinery producers), and Haldex (a Hungarian-Polish joint enterprise for reprocessing coal slag).<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

==Nature of operation==

Comecon was an interstate organization through which members attempted to coordinate economic activities of mutual interest and to develop multilateral economic, scientific, and technical cooperation:<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />
* The Charter (1959) stated that \"the sovereign equality of all members\" was fundamental to the organization and procedures of Comecon.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /><ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 544\"/>
* The Comprehensive Program further emphasized that the processes of integration of members' economies were \"completely voluntary and do not involve the creation of supranational bodies.\" Hence under the provisions of the Charter, each country had the right to equal representation and one vote in all organs of Comecon, regardless of the country's economic size or the size of its contribution to Comecon's budget.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />
* From 1967, the \"interestedness\" provisions of the Charter reinforced the principle of \"sovereign equality.\" Comecon's recommendations and decisions could be adopted only upon agreement among the interested members, and each had the right to declare its \"interest\" in any matter under consideration.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /><ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\"/>
* Furthermore, in the words of the Charter (as revised in 1967), \"recommendations and decisions shall not apply to countries that have declared that they have no interest in a particular matter.\"<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /><ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\"/>
* Although Comecon recognized the principle of unanimity, from 1967 disinterested parties did not have a veto but rather the right to abstain from participation. A declaration of disinterest could not block a project unless the disinterested party's participation was vital. Otherwise, the Charter implied that the interested parties could proceed without the abstaining member, affirming that a country that had declared a lack of interest \"may subsequently adhere to the recommendations and decisions adopted by the remaining members of the Council.\"<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /> However, a member country could also declare an \"interest\" and exercise a veto.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\"/>

Over the years of its functioning, Comecon acted more as an instrument of mutual economic assistance than a means of economic integration, with multilateralism as an unachievable goal.<ref>Zwass, 1989, pp. 14–21</ref> J.F. Brown, a British historian of Eastern Europe, cited Vladimir Sobell, a Czech-born economist, for the view that Comecon was an \"international protection system\" rather than an \"international trade system\", in contrast with the EEC, which was essentially the latter.<ref name=\"Brown_1988\">{{Citation |last=Brown |first=J.F. |year=1988 |title=Eastern Europe and Communist Rule |publisher=Duke University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=vlhpAAAAMAAJ |isbn=978-0882308418}}, pp. 145–56.</ref> Whereas the latter was interested in production efficiency and in allocation via market prices, the former was interested in bilateral aid to fulfill central planning goals.<ref name=\"Brown_1988\"/> Writing in 1988, Brown stated that many people in both the West and the East had assumed that a trade and efficiency approach was what Comecon was meant to pursue, which might make it an international trade system more like the EEC, and that some economists in Hungary and Poland had advocated such an approach in the 1970s and 1980s, but that \"it would need a transformation of every [Eastern Bloc] economy along Hungarian lines [i.e., only partly centrally planned] to enable a market-guided Comecon to work. And any change along those lines has been ideologically unacceptable up to now.\"<ref name=\"Brown_1988\"/>

==Comecon versus the European Economic Community==
[[File:Europe 1988.svg|thumb|European [[trade bloc]]s as of the late 1980s. EEC member states are marked in blue, [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] &ndash; green, and Comecon &ndash; red.]]

Although Comecon was loosely referred to as the \"[[European Economic Community]] (EEC) of (Central and) Eastern Europe,\" important contrasts existed between the two organizations. Both organizations administered economic integration; however, their economic structure, size, balance, and influence differed:<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

In the 1980s, the EEC incorporated the 270 million people in Europe into economic association through intergovernmental agreements aimed at maximizing profits and economic efficiency on a national and international scale. The EEC was a supranational body that could adopt decisions (such as removing tariffs) and enforce them. Activity by members was based on initiative and enterprise from below (on the individual or enterprise level) and was strongly influenced by market forces.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

Comecon joined together 450 million people in 10 countries and on 3 continents. The level of industrialization from country to country differed greatly: the organization linked two underdeveloped countries &ndash; Mongolia, and Vietnam &ndash; with some highly industrialized states. Likewise, a large national income difference existed between European and non-European members. The physical size, military power, and political and economic resource base of the Soviet Union made it the dominant member. In trade among Comecon members, the Soviet Union usually provided raw materials, and Central and East European countries provided finished equipment and machinery. The three underdeveloped Comecon members had a special relationship with the other seven. Comecon realized disproportionately more political than economic gains from its heavy contributions to these three countries' underdeveloped economies. Economic integration or \"plan coordination\" formed the basis of Comecon's activities. In this system, which mirrored the member countries' planned economies, the decisions handed down from above ignored the influences of market forces or private initiative. Comecon had no supranational authority to make decisions or to implement them. Its recommendations could only be adopted with the full concurrence of interested parties and (from 1967<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\"/>) did not affect those members who declared themselves disinterested parties.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

As remarked above, most Comecon foreign trade was a state monopoly, placing several barriers between a producer and a foreign customer.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 565\"/> Unlike the EEC, where treaties mostly limited government activity and allowed the market to integrate economies across national lines, Comecon needed to develop agreements that called for positive government action. Furthermore, while private trade slowly limited or erased national rivalries in the EEC, state-to-state trade in Comecon reinforced national rivalries and resentments.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 567.</ref>

Soviet domination of Comecon was a function of its economic, political, and military power. The Soviet Union possessed 90 percent of Comecon members' land and energy resources, 70 percent of their population, 65 percent of their national income, and industrial and military capacities second in the world only to those of the United States .{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}The location of many Comecon committee headquarters in Moscow and the large number of Soviet nationals in positions of authority also testified to the power of the Soviet Union within the organization.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

Soviet efforts to exercise political power over its Comecon partners, however, were met with determined opposition. The \"sovereign equality\" of members, as described in the Comecon Charter, assured members that if they did not wish to participate in a Comecon project, they might abstain. Central and East European members frequently invoked this principle in fear that economic interdependence would further reduce political sovereignty. Thus, neither Comecon nor the Soviet Union as a major force within Comecon had supranational authority. Although this fact ensured some degree of freedom from Soviet economic domination of the other members, it also deprived Comecon of necessary power to achieve maximum economic efficiency.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

The '''Council for Mutual Economic Assistance''' ({{Lang-rus|Сове́т Экономи́ческой Взаимопо́мощи|r=Sovét Ekonomícheskoy Vzaimopómoshchi}}, {{Lang|ru|СЭВ|r='''SEV'''}}; English abbreviation <small>'''COMECON'''</small>, <small>'''CMEA'''</small>, <small>'''CEMA'''</small>, or <small>'''CAME'''</small>) was an economic organization from 1949 to 1991 under the leadership of the [[Soviet Union]] that comprised the countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]] along with a number of [[socialist state]]s elsewhere in the world.<ref>Michael C. Kaser, ''Comecon: Integration problems of the planned economies'' (Oxford University Press, 1967).</ref>

The descriptive term was often applied to all multilateral activities involving members of the organization, rather than being restricted to the direct functions of Comecon and its organs.<ref>For example, this is the usage in the [[United States Library of Congress|Library of Congress]] [[Library of Congress Country Studies|Country Study]] that is heavily cited in the present article.</ref> This usage was sometimes extended as well to bilateral relations among members because in the system of Communist international economic relations, multilateral accords{{snd}} typically of a general nature{{snd}} tended to be implemented through a set of more detailed, bilateral agreements.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

Moscow was concerned about the [[Marshall Plan]]. Comecon was meant to prevent countries in the [[Soviet sphere of influence]] from moving towards that of the Americans and South-East Asia. Comecon was the Eastern Bloc's response to the formation in Western Europe of the Marshall Plan and the OEEC, which later became the [[OECD]].<ref name=\"loc-cs\">\"Germany (East)\", Library of Congress Country Study, [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html Appendix B: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501075842/http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html |date=2009-05-01 }}</ref>

{{main|History of the Comecon}}
[[File:Ex-Comecon building, 2009-06-22.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Former Comecon headquarters in Moscow.]]

===Foundation===
The Comecon was founded in 1949 by the [[Soviet Union]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]. The primary factors in Comecon's formation appear to have been [[Joseph Stalin]]'s desire to cooperate and strengthen the international relationships at an economic level with the smaller states of Central Europe,<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /> and which were now, increasingly, cut off from their traditional markets and suppliers in the rest of Europe.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 536\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 536.</ref> Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland had remained interested in Marshall aid despite the requirements for a [[convertible currency]] and [[market economy|market economies]]. These requirements, which would inevitably have resulted in stronger economic ties to free European markets than to the Soviet Union, were unacceptable to Stalin, who in July 1947, ordered these communist-dominated governments to pull out of the Paris Conference on the European Recovery Programme. This has been described as \"the moment of truth\" in the post-[[World War II]] division of Europe.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 534–35.</ref> According to the Soviet view the \"Anglo-American bloc\" and \"American monopolists ... whose interests had nothing in common with those of the European people\" had spurned East-West collaboration within the framework agreed within the United Nations, that is, through the Economic Commission for Europe.<ref>Kaser, 1967, pp. 9–10.</ref>

As always, Stalin's precise motives are \"inscrutable\"<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 535\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 535.</ref> They may well have been \"more negative than positive\", with Stalin \"more anxious to keep other powers out of neighbouring [[buffer state]]s… than to integrate them.\"<ref>W. Wallace and R. Clarke, ''Comecon, Trade, and [[Western World|the West]]'', London: Pinter (1986), p. 1, quoted by Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 536.</ref> Furthermore, [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]]'s notion of ostensibly nondiscriminatory treatment of trade partners was thought to be incompatible with notions of [[socialism|socialist]] solidarity.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 536\"/> In any event, proposals for a [[customs union]] and economic integration of Central and Eastern Europe date back at least to the [[Revolutions of 1848]] (although many earlier proposals had been intended to stave off the Russian and/or communist \"menace\")<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 536\"/> and the state-to-state trading inherent in centrally planned economies required some sort of coordination: otherwise, a [[monopoly|monopolist]] seller would face a [[monopsony|monopsonist]] buyer, with no structure to set prices.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 536–37.</ref>

Comecon was established at a Moscow economic conference January 5–8, 1949, at which the six founding member countries were represented; its foundation was publicly announced on January 25; [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] joined a month later and [[East Germany]] in 1950.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 535\"/>

Recent research by the Romanian researcher Elena Dragomir suggests that Romania played a rather important role in the Comecon's creation in 1949. Dragomir argues that Romania was interested in the creation of a “system of cooperation” to improve its trade relations with the other people's democracies, especially with those able to export industrial equipment and machinery to Romania.<ref>Elena Dragomir, ‘The formation of the Soviet bloc’s Council for Mutual Economic Assistance: Romania’s involvement’, Journal Cold War Studies, xiv (2012), 34–47.http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/JCWS_a_00190#.VQKof9KsX65.</ref> According to Dragomir, in December 1948, the Romanian leader [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] sent a letter to Stalin, proposing the creation of the Comecon.<ref>Elena Dragomir, 'The creation of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance as seen from the Romanian Archives', in ''Historical Research'', September 2014. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2281.12083/abstract.</ref>
{{confusing|date=December 2016}}
At first, planning seemed to be moving along rapidly. After pushing aside [[Nikolai Voznesensky]]'s [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]]ic, price-based approach (see further discussion [[#How Comecon exchanges worked|below]]), the direction appeared to be toward a coordination of national economic plans, but with no coercive authority from Comecon itself. All decisions would require unanimous ratification, and even then governments would separately translate these into policy.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 539–41.</ref> Then in summer 1950, probably unhappy with the favorable implications for the effective individual and collective [[sovereignty]] of the smaller states, Stalin \"seems to have taken [Comecon's] personnel by surprise,\"{{clarify|date=December 2016}} bringing operations to a nearly complete halt, as the Soviet Union moved domestically toward [[autarky]] and internationally toward an \"embassy system of meddling in other countries' affairs directly\" rather than by \"constitutional means\"{{clarify|date=December 2016}}. Comecon's scope was officially limited in November 1950 to \"practical questions of facilitating trade.\"{{clarify|date=December 2016}}<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 541–42.</ref>

One important legacy of this brief period of activity was the [[Sofia principle]], adopted at the August 1949 Comecon council session in Bulgaria. This radically weakened [[intellectual property]] rights, making each country's technologies available to the others for a nominal charge that did little more than cover the cost of documentation. This, naturally, benefited the less industrialized Comecon countries, and especially the technologically lagging Soviet Union, at the expense of East Germany and Czechoslovakia and, to a lesser extent, Hungary and Poland. (This principle would weaken after 1968, as it became clear that it discouraged new research—and as the Soviet Union itself began to have more marketable technologies.)<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 542\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 542–43.</ref>

===Khrushchev era===
After Stalin's death in 1953, Comecon again began to find its footing. In the early 1950s, all Comecon countries had adopted relatively [[Autarky|autarkic]] policies; now they began again to discuss developing complementary specialties, and in 1956, ten permanent standing committees arose, intended to facilitate coordination in these matters. The Soviet Union began to trade [[petroleum|oil]] for Comecon manufactured goods. There was much discussion of coordinating [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plan]]s.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 542\"/>

However, once again, trouble arose. The [[Poznań 1956 protests|Polish protests]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian uprising]] led to major social and economic changes, including the 1957 abandonment of the [[Five-Year Plan (USSR)#Sixth Plan, 1956–1960|1956–60 Soviet five-year plan]], as the Comecon governments struggled to reestablish their legitimacy and popular support.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 543–34.</ref> The next few years saw a series of small steps toward increased trade and economic integration, including the introduction of the \"{{ill|convertible rouble|ru|Переводный рубль}}\", revised efforts at national specialization, and a 1959 charter modeled after the 1957 [[Treaty of Rome]].<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 544\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 544.</ref>

Once again, efforts at transnational [[economic planning|central planning]] failed. In December 1961, a council session approved the Basic Principles of the International Socialist Division of Labour, which talked of closer coordination of plans and of \"concentrating production of similar products in one or several socialist countries.\" In November 1962, Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] followed this up with a call for \"a common single planning organ.\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 559.</ref> This was resisted by Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland, but most emphatically by increasingly nationalistic Romania, which strongly rejected the notion that they should specialize in agriculture.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 560.</ref> In Central and Eastern Europe, only Bulgaria happily took on an assigned role (also agricultural, but in Bulgaria's case this had been the country's chosen direction even as an independent country in the 1930s).<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 553.</ref> Essentially, by the time the Soviet Union was calling for tight economic integration, they no longer had the power to impose it. Despite some slow headway—integration increased in petroleum, electricity, and other technical/scientific sectors—and the 1963 founding of an International Bank for Economic Co-operation, Comecon countries all increased trade with [[Western World|the West]] relatively more than with one another.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 560–61.</ref>

===Brezhnev era===
From its founding until 1967, Comecon had operated only on the basis of unanimous agreements. It had become increasingly obvious that the result was usually failure. In 1967, Comecon adopted the \"interested party principle\", under which any country could opt out of any project they chose, still allowing the other member states to use Comecon mechanisms to coordinate their activities. In principle, a country could still veto, but the hope was that they would typically choose just to step aside rather than either veto or be a reluctant participant.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 561.</ref> This aimed, at least in part, at allowing Romania to chart its own economic course without leaving Comecon entirely or bringing it to an impasse.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 566.</ref>

Also until the late 1960s, the official term for Comecon activities was ''cooperation''. The term ''integration'' was always avoided because of its connotations of monopolistic capitalist collusion. After the \"special\" council session of April 1969 and the development and adoption (in 1971) of the Comprehensive Program for the Further Extension and Improvement of Cooperation and the Further Development of Socialist Economic Integration by Comecon Member Countries, Comecon activities were officially termed ''integration'' (equalization of \"differences in relative scarcities of goods and services between states through the deliberate elimination of barriers to trade and other forms of interaction\"). Although such equalization had not been a pivotal point in the formation and implementation of Comecon's economic policies, improved economic integration had always been Comecon's goal.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /><ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 564, 566.</ref>

While such integration was to remain a goal, and while Bulgaria became yet more tightly integrated with the Soviet Union, progress in this direction was otherwise continually frustrated by the national central planning prevalent in all Comecon countries, by the increasing diversity of its members (which by this time included Mongolia and would soon include Cuba) and by the \"overwhelming asymmetry\" and resulting distrust between the many small member states and the Soviet \"superstate\" which, in 1983, \"accounted for 88 percent of Comecon's territory and 60 percent of its population.\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 564.</ref>

In this period, there were some efforts to move away from central planning, by establishing intermediate industrial associations and combines in various countries (which were often empowered to negotiate their own international deals). However, these groupings typically proved \"unwieldy, conservative, risk-averse, and bureaucratic,\" reproducing the problems they had been intended to solve.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 568\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 568–69.</ref>

One economic success of the 1970s was the development of Soviet oil fields. While doubtless \"(Central and) East Europeans resented having to defray some of the costs of developing the economy of their hated overlord and oppressor,\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 568.</ref> they benefited from low prices for fuel and other mineral products. As a result, Comecon economies generally showed strong growth in the mid-1970s. They were largely unaffected by the [[1973 oil crisis]].<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 568\"/> Another short-term economic gain in this period was that ''[[détente]]'' brought opportunities for investment and technology transfers from [[Western World|the West]]. This also led to an importation of [[Western World|Western]] cultural attitudes, especially in Central Europe. However, many undertakings based on [[Western World|Western]] technology were less than successful (for example, Poland's [[Ursus Factory|Ursus]] tractor factory did not do well with technology licensed from [[Massey Ferguson]]); other investment was wasted on luxuries for the party elite, and most Comecon countries ended up indebted to [[Western World|the West]] when capital flows died out as ''détente'' faded in the late 1970s, and from 1979 to 1983, all of Comecon experienced a recession from which (with the possible exceptions of East Germany and Bulgaria) they never recovered in the Communist era. Romania and Poland experienced major declines in the standard of living.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 571–72.</ref>

===Perestroika===
The 1985 Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Progress and the rise to power of Soviet general secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] increased Soviet influence in Comecon operations and led to attempts to give Comecon some degree of supranational authority. The Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Progress was designed to improve economic cooperation through the development of a more efficient and interconnected scientific and technical base.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /> This was the era of ''[[perestroika]]'' (\"restructuring\"), the last attempt to put the Comecon economies on a sound economic footing.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 579.</ref> Gorbachev and his economic mentor [[Abel Aganbegyan]] hoped to make \"revolutionary changes\" in the economy, foreseeing that \"science will increasingly become a 'direct productive force', as Marx foresaw… By the year 2000… the renewal of plant and machinery… will be running at 6 percent or more per year.\"<ref>Abel Aganbegyan, quoted in Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 580.</ref>

The program was not a success. \"The Gorbachev regime made too many commitments on too many fronts, thereby overstretching and overheating the Soviet economy. Bottlenecks and shortages were not relieved but exacerbated, while the (Central and) East European members of Comecon resented being asked to contribute scarce capital to projects that were chiefly of interest to the Soviet Union…\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 580.</ref> Furthermore, the liberalization that by June 25, 1988 allowed Comecon countries to negotiate trade treaties directly with the European Community (the renamed EEC), and the \"[[Sinatra doctrine]]\" under which the Soviet Union allowed that change would be the exclusive affair of each individual country marked the beginning of the end for Comecon. Although the [[Revolutions of 1989]] did not formally end Comecon, and the Soviet government itself lasted until 1991, the March 1990 meeting in Prague was little more than a formality, discussing the coordination of non-existent five-year plans. From January 1, 1991, the countries shifted their dealings with one another to a hard currency market basis. The result was a radical decrease in trade with one another, as \"(Central and) Eastern Europe… exchanged asymmetrical trade dependence on the Soviet Union for an equally asymmetrical commercial dependence on the European Community.\"<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 580–82; the quotation is on p. 582.</ref>

The final Comecon council session took place on June 28, 1991, in [[Budapest]], and led to an agreement to disband within 90 days.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 582.</ref> The Soviet Union itself was dismantled on December 26, 1991.

===Post-Cold War activity after Comecon===
After the fall of the Soviet Union and communist rule in Eastern Europe, [[East Germany]] (now unified with Germany) automatically joined the [[European Union]] (then the European Community) in 1990. The [[Baltic States]] ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]), [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Slovenia]] joined the EU in 2004, followed by [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] in 2007 and [[Croatia]] in 2013. To date, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany (former GDR), Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia are now members of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. All four Central European states are now members of the [[Visegrad Group]].

Russia, the successor to the Soviet Union along with [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] founded the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] which consists of the ex-Soviet republics. The country also leads the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] with [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] and the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] with [[Armenia]], Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Along with Ukraine, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Moldova]] are also part of the [[GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development|GUAM]].

[[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]] joined the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] in 1995 and 1997 respectively.

In the late 1950s, a number of communist-ruled non-member countries{{snd}} the [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]], [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]{{snd}} were invited to participate as observers in Comecon sessions. Although Mongolia and Vietnam later gained full membership, China stopped attending Comecon sessions after 1961. Yugoslavia negotiated a form of associate status in the organization, specified in its 1964 agreement with Comecon.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /> Collectively, the members of the Comecon did not display the necessary prerequisites for economic integration: their level of industrialization was low and uneven, with a single dominant member (the Soviet Union) producing 70% of the community national product.<ref>Zwass, 1989, p. 4</ref>

In the late 1980s, there were ten full members: the Soviet Union, six East European countries, and three extra-regional members. Geography, therefore, no longer united Comecon members. Wide variations in economic size and level of economic development also tended to generate divergent interests among the member countries. All these factors combined to give rise to significant differences in the member states' expectations about the benefits to be derived from membership in Comecon. Unity was provided instead by political and ideological factors. All Comecon members were \"united by a commonality of fundamental class interests and the ideology of Marxism-Leninism\" and had common approaches to economic ownership (state versus private) and management (plan versus market). In 1949 the ruling communist parties of the founding states were also linked internationally through the [[Cominform]], from which [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] [[Informbiro|had been expelled]] the previous year. Although the Cominform was disbanded in 1956, interparty links continued to be strong among Comecon members, and all participated in periodic international conferences of communist parties. Comecon provided a mechanism through which its leading member, the Soviet Union, sought to foster economic links with and among its closest political and military allies. The East European members of Comecon were also militarily allied with the Soviet Union in the [[Warsaw Pact]].<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

There were three kinds of relationships &ndash; besides the 10 full memberships &ndash; with the Comecon:

* Yugoslavia was the only country considered to have associate member status. On the basis of the 1964 agreement, Yugoslavia participated in twenty-one of the thirty-two key Comecon institutions as if it were a full member.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />
* [[Finland]], [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], [[Mexico]], and [[Nicaragua]] had a cooperant status with Comecon. Because the governments of these countries were not empowered to conclude agreements in the name of private companies, the governments did not take part in Comecon operations. They were represented in Comecon by commissions made up of members of the government and the business community. The commissions were empowered to sign various \"framework\" agreements with Comecon's Joint Commission on Cooperation.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />
* After 1956, Comecon allowed certain countries with communist or pro-Soviet governments to attend sessions as observers. In November 1986, delegations from [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[Derg|Ethiopia]], [[Laos]], and [[South Yemen]] attended the 42nd Council Session as observers.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

==Exchange==
Working with neither meaningful [[exchange rate]]s nor a market economy, Comecon countries had to look to world markets as a reference point for prices, but unlike agents acting in a market, prices tended to be stable over a period of years, rather than constantly fluctuating, which assisted central planning. Also, there was a tendency to underprice raw materials relative to the manufactured goods produced in many of the Comecon countries.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 537\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 537.</ref>

International barter helped preserve the Comecon countries' scarce [[hard currency]] reserves. In strict economic terms, barter inevitably harmed countries whose goods would have brought higher prices in the free market or whose imports could have been obtained more cheaply and benefitted those for whom it was the other way around. Still, all of the Comecon countries gained some stability, and the governments gained some legitimacy,<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 537\"/> and in many ways this stability and protection from the world market was viewed, at least in the early years of Comecon, as an advantage of the system, as was the formation of stronger ties with other socialist countries.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 538.</ref>

Within Comecon, there were occasional struggles over just how this system should work. Early on, [[Nikolai Voznesensky]] pushed for a more \"law-governed\" and [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]]ic price-based approach. However, with the August 1948 death of [[Andrei Zhdanov]], Voznesensky lost his patron and was soon accused of treason as part of the [[Leningrad Affair]]; within two years he was dead in prison. Instead, what won out was a \"physical planning\" approach that strengthened the role of central governments over technocrats.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 539\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 539.</ref> At the same time, the effort to create a single regime of planning \"common economic organization\" with the ability to set plans throughout the Comecon region also came to nought. A protocol to create such a system was signed January 18, 1949, but never ratified.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 540.</ref> While historians are not unanimous on why this was stymied, it clearly threatened the sovereignty not only of the smaller states but even of the Soviet Union itself, since an international body would have had real power; Stalin clearly preferred informal means of intervention in the other Comecon states.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 540–41.</ref> This lack of either rationality or international central planning tended to promote [[autarky]] in each Comecon country because none fully trusted the others to deliver goods and services.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 539\"/>

With few exceptions, foreign trade in the Comecon countries was a [[state monopoly]], and the state agencies and captive trading companies were often corrupt. Even at best, this tended to put several removes between a producer and any foreign customer, limiting the ability to learn to adjust to foreign customers' needs. Furthermore, there was often strong political pressure to keep the best products for domestic use in each country. From the early 1950s to Comecon's demise in the early 1990s, intra-Comecon trade, except for Soviet petroleum, was in steady decline.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 565\">Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 565.</ref>

===Oil transfers===
Beginning no later than the early 1970s,<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 569.</ref> Soviet petroleum and [[natural gas]] were routinely transferred within Comecon at below-market rates. Most [[Western World|Western]] commentators have viewed this as implicit, politically motivated subsidization of shaky economies to defuse discontent and reward compliance with Soviet wishes.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 570 makes the assertion about this being the dominant view, and cites several examples.</ref> Other commentators say that this may not have been deliberate policy, noting that whenever prices differ from world market prices, there will be winners and losers. They argue that this may have been simply an unforeseen consequence of two factors: the slow adjustment of Comecon prices during a time of rising oil and gas prices, and the fact that mineral resources were abundant in the Comecon sphere, relative to manufactured goods. A possible point of comparison is that there were also winners and losers under EEC agricultural policy in the same period.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 570–71.</ref> Russian and Kazakh oil kept the Comecon countries' oil prices low when the [[1973 oil crisis]] quadrupled Western oil prices.

===Ineffective production===
The organization of Comecon was officially focused on common expansion of states, more effective production and building relationships between countries within. And as in every planned economy, operations did not reflect state of market, innovations, availability of items or the specific needs of a country. One example came from former Czechoslovakia. In the 1970s, the Communist party of Czechoslovakia finally realized that there was a need for underground trains. Czechoslovak designers projected a cheap but technologically innovative underground train. The train was a state-of-the-art project, capable of moving underground or on the surface using standard rails, had a high number of passenger seats, and was lightweight. According to the designers, the train was technologically more advanced than the trains used in New York's Subway, London's Tube or the Paris Metro. However, due to the plan of Comecon, older Soviet trains were used, which guaranteed profit for the Soviet Union and work for workers in Soviet factories. That economical change lead to the cancellation of the R1 trains by A. Honzík. The Comecon plan, though more profitable for the Soviets, if less resourceful for the Czechs and Slovaks, forced the Czechoslovak government to buy trains \"Ečs (81-709)\" and \"81-71\", both of which were designed in early 1950s and were heavy, unreliable and expensive. (Materials available only in Czech Republic and Slovakia, video included)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/program/409235100061001.html|title=Zašlapané projekty: Pražské metro — Česká televize|website=Česká televize|accessdate=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619103116/http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/program/409235100061001.html|archivedate=19 June 2010}}</ref>

On the other hand, Czechoslovak trams ([[Tatra T3]]) and jet trainers ([[Aero L-29 Delfín|L-29]]) were the standard for all Comecon countries, including the USSR, and other countries could develop their own designs but only for their own needs, like Poland (respectively, [[Konstal]] trams and [[PZL TS-11 Iskra|TS-11]] jets). Poland was a manufacturer of light helicopters for Comecon countries ([[Mil Mi-2|Mi-2]] of the Soviet design). The USSR developed their own model [[Kamov Ka-26]] and Romania produced French helicopters under license for their own market. In a formal or informal way, often the countries were discouraged from developing their own designs that competed with the main Comecon design.

==Structure==

Although not formally part of the organization's hierarchy, the Conference of First Secretaries of Communist and Workers' Parties and of the Heads of Government of the Comecon Member Countries was Comecon's most important organ. These party and government leaders gathered for conference meetings regularly to discuss topics of mutual interest. Because of the rank of conference participants, their decisions had considerable influence on the actions taken by Comecon and its organs.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

The official hierarchy of Comecon consisted of the Session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the Executive Committee of the Council, the Secretariat of the Council, four council committees, twenty-four standing commissions, six interstate conferences, two scientific institutes, and several associated organizations.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

===The Session===
The Session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, officially the highest Comecon organ, examined fundamental problems of economic integration and directed the activities of the Secretariat and other subordinate organizations. Delegations from each Comecon member country attended these meetings. Prime ministers usually headed the delegations, which met during the second quarter of each year in a member country's capital (the location of the meeting was determined by a system of rotation based on [[Cyrillic script]]). All interested parties had to consider recommendations handed down by the Session. A [[treaty]] or other kind of legal agreement implemented adopted recommendations. Comecon itself might adopt decisions only on organizational and procedural matters pertaining to itself and its organs.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

Each country appointed one permanent representative to maintain relations between members and Comecon between annual meetings. An extraordinary Session, such as the one in December 1985, might be held with the consent of at least one-third of the members. Such meetings usually took place in Moscow.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

===Executive Committee===
The highest executive organ in Comecon, the Executive Committee, was entrusted with elaborating policy recommendations and supervising their implementation between sessions. In addition, it supervised work on plan coordination and scientific-technical cooperation. Composed of one representative from each member country, usually a deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers, the Executive Committee met quarterly, usually in Moscow. In 1971 and 1974, the Executive Committee acquired economic departments that ranked above the standing commissions. These economic departments considerably strengthened the authority and importance of the Executive Committee.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

===Other entities===
There were four council committees: Council Committee for Cooperation in Planning, Council Committee for Scientific and Technical Cooperation, Council Committee for Cooperation in Material and Technical Supply, and Council Committee for Cooperation in Machine Building. Their mission was \"to ensure the comprehensive examination and a multilateral settlement of the major problems of cooperation among member countries in the economy, science, and technology.\" All committees were headquartered in Moscow and usually met there. These committees advised the standing commissions, the Secretariat, the interstate conferences, and the scientific institutes in their areas of specialization. Their jurisdiction was generally wider than that of the standing commissions because they had the right to make policy recommendations to other Comecon organizations.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

The Council Committee for Cooperation in Planning was the most important of the four. It coordinated the national economic plans of Comecon members. As such, it ranked in importance only after the Session and the Executive Committee. Made up of the chairmen of Comecon members' national central planning offices, the Council Committee for Cooperation in Planning drew up draft agreements for joint projects, adopted a resolution approving these projects, and recommended approval to the concerned parties. If its decisions were not subject to approval by national governments and parties, this committee would be considered Comecon's supranational planning body.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

The international Secretariat, Comecon's only permanent body, was Comecon's primary economic research and administrative organ. The secretary, who has been a Soviet official since Comecon creation, was the official Comecon representative to Comecon member states and to other states and international organizations. Subordinate to the secretary were his deputy and the various departments of the Secretariat, which generally corresponded to the standing commissions. The Secretariat's responsibilities included preparation and organization of Comecon sessions and other meetings conducted under the auspices of Comecon; compilation of digests on Comecon activities; conduct of economic and other research for Comecon members; and preparation of recommendations on various issues concerning Comecon operations.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

In 1956, eight standing commissions were set up to help Comecon make recommendations pertaining to specific economic sectors. The commissions have been rearranged and renamed a number of times since the establishment of the first eight. In 1986 there were twenty-four standing commissions, each headquartered in the capital of a member country and headed by one of that country's leading authorities in the field addressed by the commission. The Secretariat supervised the actual operations of the commissions. The standing commissions had authority only to make recommendations, which had then to be approved by the Executive Committee, presented to the Session, and ratified by the interested member countries. Commissions usually met twice a year in Moscow.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

The six interstate conferences (on water management, internal trade, legal matters, inventions and [[patents]], pricing, and labor affairs) served as forums for discussing shared issues and experiences. They were purely consultative and generally acted in an advisory capacity to the Executive Committee or its specialized committees.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

The scientific institutes on standardization and on economic problems of the world economic system concerned themselves with theoretical problems of international cooperation. Both were headquartered in Moscow and were staffed by experts from various member countries.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

===Affiliated agencies===
[[File:Budapest, Hungary Elisabeth Bridge Medal 1974.jpg|thumb|1974 Medallion 10th Anniversary of Intermetall, that was founded in 1964 in Budapest]]

Several affiliated agencies, having a variety of relationships with Comecon, existed outside the official Comecon hierarchy. They served to develop \"direct links between appropriate bodies and organizations of Comecon member countries.\"<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

These affiliated agencies were divided into two categories: intergovernmental economic organizations (which worked on a higher level in the member countries and generally dealt with a wider range of managerial and coordinative activities) and international economic organizations (which worked closer to the operational level of research, production, or trade). A few examples of the former are the [[International Bank for Economic Cooperation]] (managed the transferable ruble system), the [[International Investment Bank]] (in charge of financing joint projects), and [[Intermetall]] (encouraged cooperation in [[ferrous metallurgy]]).<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

International economic organizations generally took the form of either joint enterprises, international economic associations or unions, or international economic partnerships. The latter included [[Interatominstrument]] (nuclear machinery producers), [[Intertekstilmash]] (textile machinery producers), and Haldex (a Hungarian-Polish joint enterprise for reprocessing coal slag).<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

==Nature of operation==

Comecon was an interstate organization through which members attempted to coordinate economic activities of mutual interest and to develop multilateral economic, scientific, and technical cooperation:<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />
* The Charter (1959) stated that \"the sovereign equality of all members\" was fundamental to the organization and procedures of Comecon.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /><ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 544\"/>
* The Comprehensive Program further emphasized that the processes of integration of members' economies were \"completely voluntary and do not involve the creation of supranational bodies.\" Hence under the provisions of the Charter, each country had the right to equal representation and one vote in all organs of Comecon, regardless of the country's economic size or the size of its contribution to Comecon's budget.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />
* From 1967, the \"interestedness\" provisions of the Charter reinforced the principle of \"sovereign equality.\" Comecon's recommendations and decisions could be adopted only upon agreement among the interested members, and each had the right to declare its \"interest\" in any matter under consideration.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /><ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\"/>
* Furthermore, in the words of the Charter (as revised in 1967), \"recommendations and decisions shall not apply to countries that have declared that they have no interest in a particular matter.\"<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /><ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\"/>
* Although Comecon recognized the principle of unanimity, from 1967 disinterested parties did not have a veto but rather the right to abstain from participation. A declaration of disinterest could not block a project unless the disinterested party's participation was vital. Otherwise, the Charter implied that the interested parties could proceed without the abstaining member, affirming that a country that had declared a lack of interest \"may subsequently adhere to the recommendations and decisions adopted by the remaining members of the Council.\"<ref name=\"loc-cs\" /> However, a member country could also declare an \"interest\" and exercise a veto.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\"/>

Over the years of its functioning, Comecon acted more as an instrument of mutual economic assistance than a means of economic integration, with multilateralism as an unachievable goal.<ref>Zwass, 1989, pp. 14–21</ref> J.F. Brown, a British historian of Eastern Europe, cited Vladimir Sobell, a Czech-born economist, for the view that Comecon was an \"international protection system\" rather than an \"international trade system\", in contrast with the EEC, which was essentially the latter.<ref name=\"Brown_1988\">{{Citation |last=Brown |first=J.F. |year=1988 |title=Eastern Europe and Communist Rule |publisher=Duke University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=vlhpAAAAMAAJ |isbn=978-0882308418}}, pp. 145–56.</ref> Whereas the latter was interested in production efficiency and in allocation via market prices, the former was interested in bilateral aid to fulfill central planning goals.<ref name=\"Brown_1988\"/> Writing in 1988, Brown stated that many people in both the West and the East had assumed that a trade and efficiency approach was what Comecon was meant to pursue, which might make it an international trade system more like the EEC, and that some economists in Hungary and Poland had advocated such an approach in the 1970s and 1980s, but that \"it would need a transformation of every [Eastern Bloc] economy along Hungarian lines [i.e., only partly centrally planned] to enable a market-guided Comecon to work. And any change along those lines has been ideologically unacceptable up to now.\"<ref name=\"Brown_1988\"/>

==Comecon versus the European Economic Community==
[[File:Europe 1988.svg|thumb|European [[trade bloc]]s as of the late 1980s. EEC member states are marked in blue, [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] &ndash; green, and Comecon &ndash; red.]]

Although Comecon was loosely referred to as the \"[[European Economic Community]] (EEC) of (Central and) Eastern Europe,\" important contrasts existed between the two organizations. Both organizations administered economic integration; however, their economic structure, size, balance, and influence differed:<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

In the 1980s, the EEC incorporated the 270 million people in Europe into economic association through intergovernmental agreements aimed at maximizing profits and economic efficiency on a national and international scale. The EEC was a supranational body that could adopt decisions (such as removing tariffs) and enforce them. Activity by members was based on initiative and enterprise from below (on the individual or enterprise level) and was strongly influenced by market forces.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

Comecon joined together 450 million people in 10 countries and on 3 continents. The level of industrialization from country to country differed greatly: the organization linked two underdeveloped countries &ndash; Mongolia, and Vietnam &ndash; with some highly industrialized states. Likewise, a large national income difference existed between European and non-European members. The physical size, military power, and political and economic resource base of the Soviet Union made it the dominant member. In trade among Comecon members, the Soviet Union usually provided raw materials, and Central and East European countries provided finished equipment and machinery. The three underdeveloped Comecon members had a special relationship with the other seven. Comecon realized disproportionately more political than economic gains from its heavy contributions to these three countries' underdeveloped economies. Economic integration or \"plan coordination\" formed the basis of Comecon's activities. In this system, which mirrored the member countries' planned economies, the decisions handed down from above ignored the influences of market forces or private initiative. Comecon had no supranational authority to make decisions or to implement them. Its recommendations could only be adopted with the full concurrence of interested parties and (from 1967<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 561\"/>) did not affect those members who declared themselves disinterested parties.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

As remarked above, most Comecon foreign trade was a state monopoly, placing several barriers between a producer and a foreign customer.<ref name=\"Jeffries 1998, p. 565\"/> Unlike the EEC, where treaties mostly limited government activity and allowed the market to integrate economies across national lines, Comecon needed to develop agreements that called for positive government action. Furthermore, while private trade slowly limited or erased national rivalries in the EEC, state-to-state trade in Comecon reinforced national rivalries and resentments.<ref>Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 567.</ref>

Soviet domination of Comecon was a function of its economic, political, and military power. The Soviet Union possessed 90 percent of Comecon members' land and energy resources, 70 percent of their population, 65 percent of their national income, and industrial and military capacities second in the world only to those of the United States .{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}The location of many Comecon committee headquarters in Moscow and the large number of Soviet nationals in positions of authority also testified to the power of the Soviet Union within the organization.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

Soviet efforts to exercise political power over its Comecon partners, however, were met with determined opposition. The \"sovereign equality\" of members, as described in the Comecon Charter, assured members that if they did not wish to participate in a Comecon project, they might abstain. Central and East European members frequently invoked this principle in fear that economic interdependence would further reduce political sovereignty. Thus, neither Comecon nor the Soviet Union as a major force within Comecon had supranational authority. Although this fact ensured some degree of freedom from Soviet economic domination of the other members, it also deprived Comecon of necessary power to achieve maximum economic efficiency.<ref name=\"loc-cs\" />

A '''collision avoidance system''' ('''CAS'''), also known as a '''precrash system''', '''forward collision warning system''', or '''collision mitigation system''', is an [[automobile safety]] system designed to prevent or reduce the severity of a collision.<ref name=\"mdpi\">{{cite journal |last=Lim |first=Hazel Si Min |last2=Taeihagh |first2=Araz |date=2019 |title=Algorithmic Decision-Making in AVs: Understanding Ethical and Technical Concerns for Smart Cities |journal=Sustainability |volume=11 |issue=20 |pages=5791 |doi=10.3390/su11205791}}</ref> In its basic form, a forward collision warning system monitors a vehicle's speed, the speed of a vehicle in front of it, and the distance between the vehicles, to provide a warning to the driver if the vehicles get too close so as to avoid a crash.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is a forward collision warning system? |url= https://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/Safety+Technology/fcw/ |website=www.safercar.gov |accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref> Various technologies and sensors that are used include [[radar]] (all-weather) and sometimes [[lidar|laser]] ([[Lidar|LIDAR]]) and camera (employing [[image recognition]]) to detect an imminent crash.

Collision avoidance system range from widespread systems mandatory in some countries, such as '''autonomous emergency braking''' ('''AEB''') in the EU, agreements between automakers and safety officials to make crash avoidance systems eventually standard, such as in the United States,<ref>{{cite web |title=Automakers, Safety Officials Make Crash Avoidance Systems Standard by 2022 |url= https://www.cars.com/articles/automakers-safety-officials-make-crash-avoidance-systems-standard-by-2022-1420684105016/ |website=cars.com |date=17 March 2016 |accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref> to research projects including some manufacturer specific devices.

'''Advanced emergency braking system''' ('''AEBS''') as defined by [[UN ECE]] regulation 131 is considered as: a system which can automatically detect a potential forward collision and activate the vehicle braking system to decelerate the vehicle with the purpose of avoiding or mitigating a collision.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/2015/R131r1e.pdf |title=Uniform provisions concerning the approval of motor vehicles with regard to the Advanced Emergency Braking Systems (AEBS) - Addendum: 130 - Regulation: 131 |publisher=United Nations |date=27 February 2014 |access-date=3 November 2019}}</ref>

Once an impending collision is detected, these systems provide a warning to the driver. When the collision becomes imminent, they can take action autonomously without any driver input (by braking or steering or both). Collision avoidance by braking is appropriate at low vehicle speeds (e.g. below {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}}), while collision avoidance by steering may be more appropriate at higher vehicle speeds if lanes are clear.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kanarachos |first=Stratis |title=A new method for computing optimal obstacle avoidance steering manoeuvres of vehicles |journal=International Journal of Vehicle Autonomous Systems |date=2009 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=73–95 |doi=10.1504/IJVAS.2009.027968 |url= http://www.inderscience.com/info/inarticle.php?artid=27968 |accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref> Cars with collision avoidance may also be equipped with [[adaptive cruise control|Adaptive Cruise Control]], using the same forward-looking sensors.

AEB differs from Forward Collision Warning: FCW alert the driver with a warning but does not by itself brake the vehicle.<ref name=\"thatcham.org\">{{cite web |url=https://www.thatcham.org/files/pdf/AEB_FAQ.pdf |title=Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Thatcham Research |location=UK |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501093131/https://www.thatcham.org/files/pdf/AEB_FAQ.pdf |archive-date=1 May 2018}}</ref>

According to Euro NCAP, AEB has three characteristics:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.euroncap.com/en/vehicle-safety/the-rewards-explained/autonomous-emergency-braking/ |title=Autonomous Emergency Braking |publisher=Euro NCAP |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>
* Autonomous: the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident.
* Emergency: the system will intervene only in a critical situation.
* Braking: the system tries to avoid the accident by applying the brakes.

Time-to-collision could be a way to choose which avoidance method (braking or steering) is best appropriate.<ref name=\"Hayashi2013\">{{cite conference |doi=10.3182/20130904-4-JP-2042.00104 |title=Improvement of Trajectory Tracking Performance in Autonomous Collision Avoidance by Steering |first1=Ryuzo |last1=Hayashi |first2=Puwadech |last2=Chatporntanadul |first3=Masao |last3=Nagai |conference=7th IFAC Symposium on Advances in Automotive Control |location=Tokyo |date=4 September 2013}}</ref>.

Collision avoidance system by steering is a new concept. It is considered by some research projects.<ref name=\"Hayashi2013\"/>
Collision avoidance system by steering as some limitations: over-dependence on lane markings, sensor limitations, and interaction between driver and system.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vinnova.se/en/p/improved-impact-of-collision-avoidance-by-steering-technology-on-real-life-safety/ |title=Improved Impact of Collision Avoidance by Steering Technology on Real Life Safety |website=Vinnova |location=Stockholm, Sweden |access-date=3 November 2019}}</ref>.

==History==
Early warning systems were attempted as early as the late 1950s. An example is [[Cadillac]], which developed a prototype vehicle named the [[Cadillac Cyclone]] which used the new radar technology to detect objects in front of the car with the radar sensors mounted inside \"nose cones\". It was deemed too costly to manufacture.

The first modern forward collision avoidance system was demonstrated in 1995 by a team of scientists and engineers at [[Hughes Research Laboratories]] in [[Malibu, California]]. The project was funded by [[Delco Electronics]], and was led by HRL physicist Ross D. Olney. The technology was marketed as ''Forewarn''. The system was radar based{{snd}} a technology that was readily available at [[Hughes Electronics]], but not commercially elsewhere. A small custom fabricated radar antenna was developed specifically for this automotive application at 77&nbsp;GHz.<ref>{{citation|title=Collision Warning System Technology |first=R.D. |last=Olney |work=Intelligent Transport Systems World Congress |location=Yokohama, Japan |date=November 1995|display-authors=etal}}</ref> In August 1997, the first production laser adaptive cruise control on a Toyota vehicle was introduced on the [[Celsior]] model (Japan only).

In 2008, AEB was introduced in the British market.<ref name=\"trid.trb.org\">{{cite conference |url=https://trid.trb.org/view/1483883 |title=AEB Performance in the UK; A Decade of Development |last1=Sari |first1=Zahra |last2=Brookes |first2=David |last3=Avery |first3=Matthew |conference=25th International Technical Conference on the Enhanced Safety of Vehicles |publisher=Transportation Research Board |location=US |date=5 June 2017 |access-date=8 June 2019

In the early-2000s, the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) studied whether to make frontal collision warning systems and [[lane departure warning system]]s mandatory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/DOT/NHTSA/NRD/Multimedia/PDFs/Crash%20Avoidance/2003/HS809574Report.pdf |title=Forward Collision Warning Requirements Project Final Report - Task 1 |date=January 2003 |publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration |accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref> In 2011, the European Commission investigated the stimulation of \"collision mitigation by braking\" systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2011-011477+0+NOT+XML+V0//EN|title=Written question{{snd}} Rear-end traffic collisions in the European Union - E-011477/2011|work=europa.eu|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> Mandatory fitting (extra cost option) of [[Advanced Emergency Braking System]]s in commercial vehicles was scheduled to be implemented on 1 November 2013 for new vehicle types and on 1 November 2015 for all new vehicles in the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2011-011477&language=EN |title=Answer to a written question - Rear-end traffic collisions in the European Union - E-011477/2011|work=europa.eu|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> According to the \"impact assessment\",<ref>{{cite web|work=Commission of the European Communities |date=23 May 2008 |url= http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/automotive/files/safety/sec_2008_1908_en.pdf |title=Annex to the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning type-approval requirements for the general safety of motor vehicles - Impact Assessment |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150623232541/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/automotive/files/safety/sec_2008_1908_en.pdf |archivedate=23 June 2015 |accessdate=31 March 2016}}</ref> this could prevent around 5,000 fatalities and 50,000 serious injuries per year across the EU.

In March 2016, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) and the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] announced the manufacturers of 99% of U.S. automobiles had agreed to include automatic emergency braking systems as standard on virtually all new cars sold in the U.S. by 2022.<ref name=\"NHTSA2016\">{{cite web|title=U.S. DOT and IIHS announce historic commitment of 20 automakers to make automatic emergency braking standard on new vehicles|url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/us-dot-and-iihs-announce-historic-commitment-20-automakers-make-automatic-emergency|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=17 March 2016|date=17 March 2016}}</ref> In Europe, there was a related agreement about an AEBS or AEB in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/03/19/automakers-government-auto-braking-agreement/|title=Automakers agree to make auto braking a standard by 2022|publisher=}}</ref> [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) has announced that this kind of system will become mandatory for new heavy vehicles starting in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/press/pr2011/11trans_p10e.html|title=UNECE works on new standards to increase the safety of trucks and coaches|publisher=}}</ref> AEBS is regulated by UNECE regulation 131.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/2015/R131r1e.pdf |title=Uniform provisions concerning the approval of motor vehicles with regard to the Advanced Emergency Braking Systems (AEBS) |publisher=United Nations |date=27 February 2014 |access-date=21 October 2019}}</ref>.

==Benefits==
A 2012 study<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/news/rss/pr070312.html|title=Crash avoidance features cut insurance claims |publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |location=US |access-date=4 April 2015}}</ref> by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety examined how particular features of crash-avoidance systems affected the number of claims under various forms of insurance coverage. The findings indicate that two crash-avoidance features provide the biggest benefits: (a) ''autonomous braking'' that would brake on its own, if the driver does not, to avoid a forward collision, and (b) ''adaptive headlights'' that would shift the headlights in the direction the driver steers. They found lane departure systems to be not helpful, and perhaps harmful, at the circa 2012 stage of development. A 2015 Insurance Institute for Highway Safety study found forward collision warning and automatic braking systems reduced [[Rear-end collision|rear collisions]].<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.autonews.com/article/20160128/OEM06/160129871/automatic-braking-reduces-rear-end-crashes-iihs-study-finds |title=Automatic braking reduces rear-end crashes, IIHS study finds |journal=Automotive News |first=Ryan |last=Beene |date=28 January 2016 |accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref>

A 2015 study based on European and Australasian data suggests the AEB can decrease rear-end collisions by 38%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://etsc.eu/new-study-confirms-real-world-safety-benefits-of-autonomous-emergency-braking/ |title=New study confirms real-world safety benefits of autonomous emergency braking |publisher=European Transport Safety Council |date=11 July 2015 |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>

In the [[2016 Berlin attack|2016 Berlin terror attack]], a [[car-ramming attack|truck was driven into]] the Berlin [[Christmas market]] and was brought to a stop by its automatic braking system.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.dw.com/en/automatic-brakes-stopped-berlin-truck-during-christmas-market-attack/a-36936455 | title = Automatic brakes stopped Berlin truck during Christmas market attack |work = Deutsche Welle | date=28 December 2016}}</ref> Collision avoidance features are rapidly making their way into the new vehicle fleet.

In the UK and in the US, third party damages and costs have decreased by 10% and 40% according to some insurances.<ref name=\"thatcham.org\"/>

Efficiency varies depending on analysis, according to the European Commission<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/sites/roadsafety/files/pdf/ersosynthesis2018-adas.pdf |title=Advanced driver assistance systems 2018 |publisher=European Road Safety Observatory |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>:
* 38% drop in accidents according to Fildes, 2015
* 9%-20% drop in collision according to Volvo
* 44% drop according to Ciccino

In April 2019, IIHS/HLDI considered real-world benefits of crash avoidance technologies, based on rates of police-reported crashes and insurance claims. Forward collision warning plus autobrake is associated to a 50% decrease in front to rear crashes and a 56% decrease in front to rear crashes with injuries, while forward collision warning alone is associated with only a 27% decrease in front to rear crashes and an only 20% decrease in front to rear crashes with injuries. The rear automatic braking is considered to have generate a 78% decrease on backing crashes (when combined with rear view camera and parking sensor). However, repair costs with this equipment are an average of {{USD|109}} higher due to the sensors being in areas prone to damage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.iihs.org/media/259e5bbd-f859-42a7-bd54-3888f7a2d3ef/EiyeBQ/Topics/ADVANCED%20DRIVER%20ASSISTANCE/IIHS-real-world-CA-benefits-0419.pdf |title=Real-word benefits of crash avoidance technologies |publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |location=US |date=April 2019 |access-date=15 June 2019}}</ref>

==Features==
Several features are commonly found across collision avoidance systems.

AEB systems shall detect possible collisions with the car in front.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.howsafeisyourcar.com.au/aeb/ |title=Car Safety Feature - Auto Emergency Braking (AEB) |work=Howsafeisyourcar.com.au |location=Australia |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref> It performs it with sensors to detect and classify things in front of the vehicle, a system to interpret the data from the sensors, and a braking system which can work autonomously.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/33a3/170f469edad9147fa2a70544f47e6354cf90.pdf |title=Potential Benefits of Autonomous Emergency Braking Based on In-depth Crash Reconstruction and Simulation |first1=Robert |last1=Anderson |first2=Samuel |last2=Doecke |first3=James |last3=Macken |publisher=Centre for Automotive Safety Research, The University of Adelaide |location=Australia |id=Paper Number 13-0152 |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>

Some cars may implement [[lane departure warning system]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Umar Zakir Abdul |first=Hamid |title=Current Collision Mitigation Technologies for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems–A Survey |journal=PERINTIS eJournal |date=2016 |volume=6 |issue=2 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311981545 |display-authors=etal|accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref>

===Pedestrian detection===
Since 2004, Honda has developed a [[automotive night vision|night vision]] system that highlights pedestrians in front of the vehicle by alerting the driver with an audible chime and visually displaying them via HUD. Honda's system only works in temperatures below 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit). This system first appeared on the [[Honda Legend]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ae-plus.com/key%20topics/kt-safety-news7.htm |title=Safety - Honda's Intelligent Night Vision system |work=Automotive Engineer PLUS |date=October 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808135950/http://www.ae-plus.com/key%20topics/kt-safety-news7.htm |archive-date=8 August 2008}}</ref>

To assist in pedestrian safety as well as driver safety, Volvo implemented a pedestrian [[airbag]] in the [[Volvo V40 (2012–2019)|Volvo V40]], introduced in 2012.
Many more manufacturers are developing [[Pedestrian crash avoidance mitigation]] (PCAM) systems.

===ANCAP reports===
Since 2018, the ANCAP provides AEB rating and tests AEB features.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-advice/aeb-or-auto-emergency-braking-not-all-systems-are-created-equal-71160 |title=AEB or auto emergency braking: Not all systems are created equal |work=CarsGuide |location=Australia |date=26 February 2018 |first=Tom |last=White |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref> 

The ANCAP report in its adult occupant protection section contains AEB rating taking into account AEB City from 10 to 50&nbsp;km/h.

The ANCAP report in its vulnerable user protection section contains AEB rating taking into account both AEB and FCW for pedestrian and cyclists,  with various speeds named \"Operational from\" (for instance 10 to 80&nbsp;km/h) in the reports:
* For pedestrians in day and night: adult crossing, child running, and adult walking along.
* For cyclists in day only: cyclist crossing, cyclist traveling along.

The ANCAP report in its safety assist section contains AEB rating taking into account the AEB interurban with various speeds named \"Operational from\" (for instance 10 to 180&nbsp;km/h):
* HMI performance
* FCW (stationary and slower moving car)
* AEB interurban (car braking lightly, car braking heavily, driving toward slower moving car)

===Reverse automatic braking===
In the US by 2017, 5% of cars were capable of reverse automatic braking. This feature allows autonomous braking of the vehicle while working in reverse direction, to avoid a reverse collision. Those systems are assessed by IIHS.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/iihs-reverse-automatic-braking-testing/ |title=IIHS begins testing reverse automatic braking |first=Andrew |last=Krok |work=Roadshow |publisher=CNN |location=US |date=22 February 2018|access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>

==Limitations and safety issues==

A [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] communication suggests that some vehicle collision avoidance assist systems are not able to detect damaged [[crash attenuator]]s. Therefore the vehicle may drive into the crash attenuator. The NTSB considers such a feature would be a must have for safety with partial automated vehicles to detect potential hazards and warn of potential hazards to drivers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/Documents/2020-HWY18FH011-BMG-abstract.pdf |title=Collision Between a Sport Utility Vehicle Operating With Partial Driving Automationand a Crash Attenuator |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] |location=California, US |id=HWY18FH011 |date=2018-03-23 |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

\"Pre sense plus\" works in four phases. The system first provides warning of an impending accident, activating hazard warning lights, closing windows and sunroof, and pretensioning front seat belts. The warning is followed by light braking to get the driver's attention. The third phase initiates autonomous partial braking at a rate of {{cvt|3|m/s2|ft/s2|1}}. The fourth phase increases braking to {{cvt|5|m/s2|ft/s2|1}} followed by automatic full braking power, roughly half a second before projected impact. \"Pre sense rear\", is designed to reduce the consequences of rear-end collisions. The sunroof and windows are closed and seat belts are prepared for impact. The seats are moved forward to protect the car's occupants. 2015 introduced the \"avoidance assistant\" system that intervenes in the steering to help the driver avoid an obstacle. If an accident occurs, the \"turning assistant\" monitors opposing traffic when turning left at low speeds. In critical situation, it brakes the car. \"Multicollision brake assist\" uses controlled braking maneuvers during the accident to aid the driver. Both systems were introduced on the [[Audi Q7 PHEV|Second generation Q7]].<ref>{{cite press release|url= https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/press-releases/the-new-audi-q7-sportiness-efficiency-premium-comfort-410 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190519213927/https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/press-releases/the-new-audi-q7-sportiness-efficiency-premium-comfort-410 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 19 May 2019 |title=The new Audi Q7 – Sportiness, efficiency, premium comfort |publisher=Audi Media Center |date=12 December 2014}}</ref>

===BMW===
In 2012 [[BMW]] introduced two systems on the [[BMW 7 Series (F01)#2012 update|7 Series]]. \"Active Protection\" detects imminent accidents to pretension safety belts, close windows and moonroof, bring backrest of the front passenger seat to an upright position, and activate post-crash braking. A [[driver drowsiness detection]] includes an advice to take a break from driving. An \"Active Driving Assistant\" combines [[Lane departure warning system|lane departure warning]], pedestrian protection, and city collision mitigation.<ref>{{cite press release|url= https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0126929EN/the-new-bmw-7-series?language=en|title=The new BMW 7 Series|date=25 May 2012|publisher=BMW Group}}</ref>

In 2013, \"Driving Assistant Plus\" was introduced on most models combining the front-facing camera, lane-departure warning, and in some cases front radar sensors to detect vehicles ahead. Should the driver not react to the warning of a potential collision, the system would gradually prime brake pressure and apply{{snd}} with maximum deceleration power{{snd}} if necessary. In the case of a crash, the system can bring the vehicle to a standstill. Later iterations of the system on cars equipped with Automatic Cruise Control system are improved by combining radar and camera detection during fog, rain, and other situations where normal camera operations may be compromised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwusanews.com/newsrelease.do?id=1864&mid=|title=Model Year 2014 Update Information|date=16 October 2013|first=Matthew|last=Russel|publisher=BMW USA News}}</ref>

===Ford===
[[File:Collision Warning Brake Support.jpg|thumb|Collision warning and brake support on the 2009 [[Lincoln MKS]] ]]
Beginning on the 2012 Ford Focus, Active City Stop was offered on the range topping Titanium model, under the optional Sports Executive Pack. The system used windscreen mounted cameras, radars, and lidars to monitor the road ahead. The system doesn't provide a warning, rather, it can prevent a crash occurring at speeds between {{convert|3.6|and|30|km/h|abbr=on}}. This speed was later raised to {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}}, and was available on all models, the Trend, Sport, Titanium, ST, and RS (Limited Edition only).

===General Motors===
[[General Motors]]' collision alert system was introduced in [[GMC Terrain]] SUVs in 2012. It uses a camera to provide warning when there is a vehicle ahead or there is a lane departure.<ref>{{cite press release|url= https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gmc/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Sep/0929_terrain.html |title=New Camera-Based Collision Alert Debuts on GMC Terrain |work=media.gm.com|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>

If ignored, the second stage would include the E-Pretensioner's tugging on the shoulder portion of the seat belt two to three times as an additional tactile warning to the driver to take action. The third stage, in which the CMBS predicts that a collision is unavoidable, includes full seat belt slack takeup by the E-Pretensioner for more effective seat belt protection and automatic application of the brakes to lessen the severity of the predicted crash. The E-Pretensioner would also work to reduce seat belt slack whenever the brakes are applied and the brake assist system is activated.<ref name=\"world.honda.com\" />

===Mercedes-Benz===
2002: Mercedes' \"Pre-Safe\" system was exhibited at the [[Paris Motor Show]] on the 2003 [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W220)|S-Class]]. Using [[electronic stability control]] sensors to measure steering angle, vehicle yaw, and lateral acceleration and [[brake assist]] (BAS) sensors to detect emergency braking, the system can tighten the seat belts, adjust seat positions, including rear seats (if installed), raise folded rear headrests (if installed), and close the sunroof if it detects a possible collision (including rollover).<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.mercedes-benz.ca/index.cfm?NewsID=121&id=2959 |title=MERCEDES-BENZ LAUNCHES FIRST-EVER CAR WITH \"REFLEXES\" - New Pre-Safe System Anticipates Collisions to Protect Occupants |date=15 October 2002 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071008151232/http://www.mercedes-benz.ca/index.cfm?NewsID=121&id=2959 |archive-date=8 October 2007 |access-date=14 March 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> A later version of the Pre-Safe system was supplemented by an additional function that can close any open windows if necessary.

Visual and acoustic warnings are triggered when a hazard is spotted. If the driver then reacts by braking, the braking power will be boosted as the situation requires, up to a full brake application. Should the driver fail to react, Pre-Safe Brake triggers autonomous vehicle braking. Pedestrian detection is active up to about {{convert|72|km/h|abbr=on}} , and is able to reduce collisions with pedestrians autonomously from an initial speed of up to {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/> A radar sensor in the rear bumper monitors the traffic behind the vehicle. If the risk of an impact from the rear is detected, the rear hazard warning lights are activated to alert the driver of the vehicle behind (not on vehicles with USA/Canada coding). Anticipatory occupant protection measures, such as the reversible belt tensioners, are deployed. If the vehicle is stopped and the driver indicates a wish to remain stationary{{snd}} by depressing the brake pedal, activating the hold function, or moving the selector lever to \"P\"{{snd}} the system increases the brake pressure to keep the vehicle firmly braked during a possible rear-end collision.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/> Pre-Safe Impulse works an early phase of the crash, before the resulting deceleration starts to increase, the front occupants are pulled away from the direction of impact and deeper into their seats by their seat belts. By the time the accident enters the phase when loads peak, the extra distance they are retracted by can be used while dissipating energy in a controlled fashion. Pre-acceleration and force limitation allow the occupants to be temporarily isolated from the effects of the crash, significantly reducing the risk and severity of injuries in a frontal collision.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/>

===Nissan===
Nissan's [[Infiniti]] brand offers both [[lidar|laser-based]] and [[radar|radar-based]] systems.  Brake assist with preview function anticipates the need to apply emergency braking and pre-pressurize the brake system to help improve brake response. Intelligent brake assist (IBA) with forward emergency braking (FEB) (on QX80) uses radar to monitor approaching speed to the vehicle ahead, helping detect an imminent collision. It provides a two-stage warning to alert the driver, and if the driver takes no action, the system automatically engages the brakes to mitigate the collision speed and impact. Predictive forward collision warning system warns the driver of risks that may be obscured from the driver's view. It senses the relative velocity and distance of a vehicle directly ahead, as well as a vehicle travelling in front of the preceding one. The forward emergency braking system judges that deceleration is required, it alerts the driver using both a screen display and sound, then generates a force that pushes the accelerator pedal up and applies partial braking to assist the driver in slowing the vehicle down. When the system judges that there is the possibility of a collision, it will automatically apply harder braking to help avoid one.

===Subaru===
Subaru's system, branded \"EyeSight\", was announced in May 2008 using stereo camera technology to detect pedestrians and bicyclists. As initially announced, EyeSight enabled pre-collision braking control and adaptive cruise control at all speeds.<ref name=PR-100422>{{cite press release |url=https://www.subaru.co.jp/en/news/archives/contents/pdf_en_59361.pdf |title=FHI to Introduce the \"New EyeSight\" Subaru's Unique Driving Assist System with Advanced Safety Functions |date=22 April 2010 |publisher=Subaru Corporation |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref> It was rolled out in Japan to selected models in 2010; in Australia in 2011; and in North America in 2013 model year Legacy and Outback models.<ref name=PR-120316>{{cite press release |url=https://www.media.subaru-global.com/en/news/1472 |title=FHI to Introduce the \"EyeSight\" to North America - The Second Overseas Launch of Subarufs ''[sic]'' Unique Driving Assist System |date=16 March 2012 |publisher=Subaru Corporation |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref>
An alarm is used to warn the driver of a potential collision hazard in the pre-collision system. The pre-collision braking control was upgraded in 2010 to allow the vehicle to stop automatically if the speed difference between the EyeSight-equipped vehicle and the object in front is less than {{convert|30|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and the driver takes no action to slow down or stop.

[[File:Lexus Pre-Collision System frontal.jpg|thumb|2008 LS 600h forward PCS diagram, with radar (<span style=\"background:SkyBlue\">blue</span>) and [[stereo camera]] (<span style=\"background:pink\">red</span>) coverage]]

Toyota's pre-collision system (PCS) is a [[radar|radar-based]] system that uses a forward-facing millimeter-wave radar. When the system determines that a frontal collision is unavoidable, it preemptively tightens the [[seat belt]]s, removing any slack, and pre-charges the brakes using [[brake assist]] to give the driver maximum stopping power when the driver depresses the brake pedal.

2003 February: Toyota launched PCS in the redesigned [[Japanese domestic market]] [[Toyota Harrier|Harrier]].

This system monitors the driver's face to determine where the driver is looking. If the driver's head turns away from the road and a frontal obstacle is detected, the system will alert the driver using a buzzer, and if necessary, pre-charge the brakes and tighten the safety belts.

2006: the [[Lexus LS (XF40)|Lexus LS]] introduced an advanced pre-collision system (APCS), added a twin-lens stereo camera located on the windshield and a more sensitive radar to detect smaller \"soft\" objects such as animals and pedestrians. A near-infrared projector located in the headlights allows the system to work at night. With the adaptive variable suspension (AVS) and electric power steering, the system can change the [[shock absorber]] firmness, steering gear ratios, and torque assist to aid the driver's evasive steering measures. The lane departure warning system will make automatic steering adjustments to help ensure that the vehicle maintains its lane in case the driver fails to react.

2008: Improved Driver Monitoring System added on the [[Toyota Crown Hybrid|Crown]] for detecting whether the driver's eyes are properly open.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/news/08/0122.html |title=Toyota Enhances Pre-crash Safety System with Eye Monitor |publisher=Toyota.co.jp |date=22 January 2008 |accessdate=10 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132654/http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/news/08/0122.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}</ref> It monitors the driver's eyes to detect the driver's level of wakefulness. This system is designed to work even if the driver is wearing sunglasses, and at night.

2008: PCS with [[GPS]]-[[automotive navigation system|navigation]] linked brake assist function on the [[Toyota Crown Hybrid|Crown]]. The system is designed to determine if the driver is late in decelerating at an approaching stop sign, will then sound an alert and can also pre-charge the brakes to provide braking force if deemed necessary. This system works in certain Japanese cities and requires Japan specific road markings that are detected by a camera.

2009: [[Toyota Crown Hybrid|Crown]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9090326.019/toyota-launches-redesigned-crown-majesta-in-japan|title=Toyota Launches Redesigned Crown Majesta in Japan|work=Worldcarfans|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> added a front-side millimeter-wave radar to detect potential side collisions primarily at intersections or when another vehicle crosses the center line.

2012: Higher Speed APCS on the Lexus LS enables deceleration from up to {{convert|37|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, compared to the previous of {{convert|25|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The higher speed APCS uses the same technologies as then current APCS. This system increases the braking force up to twice that applied by average drivers. It was not then available in U.S. markets.

2013: Pre-collision system with pedestrian-avoidance steer assist and steering bypass assist<ref>{{cite press release|url= http://www.toyota-global.com/innovation/safety_technology/safety_technology/technology_file/pre_crash/|title=Toyota Global Site - Technology File|work=toyota-global.com|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> can help prevent collisions in cases where automatic braking alone is not sufficient, such as when the vehicle is travelling too fast or a pedestrian suddenly steps into the vehicle’s path. An on-board sensor detects pedestrians and issues a visual alert on the dashboard immediately in front of the driver if the system determines that there is a risk of collision. If the likelihood of a collision increases, the system issues an audio and visual alarm to encourage the driver to take evasive action, and the increased pre-collision braking force and automatic braking functions are activated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Different driveway alert systems|url=https://www.drivewayalertsystems.net/collections/all|publisher=www.drivewayalertsystems.net|access-date=2017-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218063710/https://www.drivewayalertsystems.net/collections/all|archive-date=2017-02-18|url-status=dead}}</ref> If the system determines that a collision cannot be avoided by braking alone and there is sufficient room for avoidance, steer assist is activated to steer the vehicle away from the pedestrian.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Crowe|first1=Phillipe|title=oyota Develops New Pedestrian Safety Technology|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/toyota-develops-new-pedestrian-safety-technology/|website=HybridCars}}</ref>

2012: [[Volkswagen Golf Mk7]] introduced a \"Proactive Occupant Protection\" that will close the windows and retract the safety belts to remove excess slack if the potential for a forward crash is detected. Multi-collision brake system (automatic post-collision braking system) to automatically brake the car after an accident in order to avoid a second collision. City emergency braking automatically activates brakes at low speeds in urban situations.

2014: [[Volkswagen Passat (B8)]] introduces pedestrian recognition a part of the system. It uses a sensor fusion between a camera and the radar sensor. There is an \"emergency assist\" in case of a non-reacting driver, the car takes the control of the brakes and the steering until a complete stop. This is also found on the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk8]].

===Volvo===
[[File:Volvo s60 2010 camera front 4831424025 5696cdbb0f z.jpg|thumb|Volvo City Safety multiple camera]]

2006: Volvo's \"Collision Warning with Auto Brake\", developed in cooperation with [[Mobileye]], was introduced on the 2007 [[Volvo S80|S80]]. This system is powered by a radar/camera sensor fusion and provides a warning through a [[head up display]] that visually resembles brake lamps. If the driver does not react, the system pre-charges the brakes and increases the brake assist sensitivity to maximize driver braking performance. Later versions will automatically apply the brakes to minimize pedestrian impacts. In some models of Volvos, the automatic braking system can be manually turned off. The [[Volvo V40 (2012–2019)|V40]] also included the first pedestrian [[airbag]], when it was introduced in 2012.

2013: Volvo introduced the first [[cyclist detection]] system. All Volvo automobiles now come standard with a [[lidar]] laser sensor that monitors the front of the roadway, and if a potential collision is detected, the safety belts will retract to reduce excess slack. Volvo now includes this safety device as an option in FH series trucks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ridS396W2BY|title=Volvo Trucks - Emergency braking at its best!|work=YouTube|access-date=25 January 2015}}</ref>

2015: \"IntelliSafe\" with auto brake at intersection. The [[Volvo XC90]] features automatic braking, if the driver turns in front of an oncoming car. This is a common scenario at busy city crossings as well as on highways, where the speed limits are higher.

==New car assessment program==
[[EuroNCAP]] and [[C-NCAP]] and ANCAP are involved in taking into account the Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) in their respective [[New Car Assessment Program]].<ref name=\"globalncap.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.globalncap.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Market-for-Vehicle-Safety.pdf |title=Creating a Global Market for Vehicle Safety |publisher=Global New Car Assessment Programme |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>

Since 2016, EuroNCAP takes into account pedestrian in AEB rating.<ref name=\"globalncap.org\"/>

In 2018, EuroNCAP provides assessments for AEB city (since 2014), AEB interurban (since 2014), AEB pedestrian (since 2018), and AEB cyclist (since 2018). Since 2018, ANCAP also provides assessments for AEB city, AEB interurban, AEB pedestrian and cyclist.

==Cost==
Many vehicles have AEB fitted as standard. The AEB is not available for every car. When AEB is available as an option, its cost can be in the £180 (AEB city only){{snd}} £1300 (regular AEB) range.<ref name=\"thatcham.org\"/>

However, due to various reason, the cost of AEB is linked to the cost of ACC and FCW.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://circabc.europa.eu/sd/a/3ab87fdc-5715-4733-af50-c3608034ca56/report_aebs_en.pdf |title=Automated Emergency Brake Systems: Technical requirements, costs and benefits |first1=C. |last1=Grover |first2=I. |last2=Knight |first3=F. |last3=Okoro |first4=I. |last4=Simmons |first5=G. |last5=Couper |first6=P. |last6=Massie |first7=B. |last7=Smith |publisher=European Commission |date=April 2008 |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Schema_ICC.svg|thumb|right|300px|Schematic of a collision avoidance system]]

A '''collision avoidance system''' ('''CAS'''), also known as a '''precrash system''', '''forward collision warning system''', or '''collision mitigation system''', is an [[automobile safety]] system designed to prevent or reduce the severity of a collision.<ref name=\"mdpi\">{{cite journal |last=Lim |first=Hazel Si Min |last2=Taeihagh |first2=Araz |date=2019 |title=Algorithmic Decision-Making in AVs: Understanding Ethical and Technical Concerns for Smart Cities |journal=Sustainability |volume=11 |issue=20 |pages=5791 |doi=10.3390/su11205791}}</ref> In its basic form, a forward collision warning system monitors a vehicle's speed, the speed of a vehicle in front of it, and the distance between the vehicles, to provide a warning to the driver if the vehicles get too close so as to avoid a crash.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is a forward collision warning system? |url= https://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/Safety+Technology/fcw/ |website=www.safercar.gov |accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref> Various technologies and sensors that are used include [[radar]] (all-weather) and sometimes [[lidar|laser]] ([[Lidar|LIDAR]]) and camera (employing [[image recognition]]) to detect an imminent crash. [[GPS]] sensors can detect fixed dangers such as approaching stop signs through a location database.<ref name=\"mdpi\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/02/13/toyota-develops-automatic-brake-system-assisted-by-gps-technology-for-safety-driving/ |title=Toyota Develops Automatic Brake System Assisted by GPS Technology for Safety Driving |first=S.Y. |last=Wong |website=My Digital Life |date=2008-02-13 |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.volvoclub.org.uk/press/releases/2007/collision_warning.shtml |title=Volvo Collision Warning with Auto Brake |website=The Volvo Owners Club |date=2007-08-29 |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=John |last=Fuller |title=How Pre-Collision Systems Work |date=22 April 2009 |work=HowStuffWorks.com |url= https://auto.howstuffworks.com/car-driving-safety/safety-regulatory-devices/pre-collision-systems.htm |accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref>

Collision avoidance system range from widespread systems mandatory in some countries, such as '''autonomous emergency braking''' ('''AEB''') in the EU, agreements between automakers and safety officials to make crash avoidance systems eventually standard, such as in the United States,<ref>{{cite web |title=Automakers, Safety Officials Make Crash Avoidance Systems Standard by 2022 |url= https://www.cars.com/articles/automakers-safety-officials-make-crash-avoidance-systems-standard-by-2022-1420684105016/ |website=cars.com |date=17 March 2016 |accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref> to research projects including some manufacturer specific devices.

'''Advanced emergency braking system''' ('''AEBS''') as defined by [[UN ECE]] regulation 131 is considered as: a system which can automatically detect a potential forward collision and activate the vehicle braking system to decelerate the vehicle with the purpose of avoiding or mitigating a collision.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/2015/R131r1e.pdf |title=Uniform provisions concerning the approval of motor vehicles with regard to the Advanced Emergency Braking Systems (AEBS) - Addendum: 130 - Regulation: 131 |publisher=United Nations |date=27 February 2014 |access-date=3 November 2019}}</ref>

Once an impending collision is detected, these systems provide a warning to the driver. When the collision becomes imminent, they can take action autonomously without any driver input (by braking or steering or both). Collision avoidance by braking is appropriate at low vehicle speeds (e.g. below {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}}), while collision avoidance by steering may be more appropriate at higher vehicle speeds if lanes are clear.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kanarachos |first=Stratis |title=A new method for computing optimal obstacle avoidance steering manoeuvres of vehicles |journal=International Journal of Vehicle Autonomous Systems |date=2009 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=73–95 |doi=10.1504/IJVAS.2009.027968 |url= http://www.inderscience.com/info/inarticle.php?artid=27968 |accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref> Cars with collision avoidance may also be equipped with [[adaptive cruise control|Adaptive Cruise Control]], using the same forward-looking sensors.

AEB differs from Forward Collision Warning: FCW alert the driver with a warning but does not by itself brake the vehicle.<ref name=\"thatcham.org\">{{cite web |url=https://www.thatcham.org/files/pdf/AEB_FAQ.pdf |title=Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Thatcham Research |location=UK |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501093131/https://www.thatcham.org/files/pdf/AEB_FAQ.pdf |archive-date=1 May 2018}}</ref>

According to Euro NCAP, AEB has three characteristics:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.euroncap.com/en/vehicle-safety/the-rewards-explained/autonomous-emergency-braking/ |title=Autonomous Emergency Braking |publisher=Euro NCAP |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>
* Autonomous: the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident.
* Emergency: the system will intervene only in a critical situation.
* Braking: the system tries to avoid the accident by applying the brakes.

Time-to-collision could be a way to choose which avoidance method (braking or steering) is best appropriate.<ref name=\"Hayashi2013\">{{cite conference |doi=10.3182/20130904-4-JP-2042.00104 |title=Improvement of Trajectory Tracking Performance in Autonomous Collision Avoidance by Steering |first1=Ryuzo |last1=Hayashi |first2=Puwadech |last2=Chatporntanadul |first3=Masao |last3=Nagai |conference=7th IFAC Symposium on Advances in Automotive Control |location=Tokyo |date=4 September 2013}}</ref>.

Collision avoidance system by steering is a new concept. It is considered by some research projects.<ref name=\"Hayashi2013\"/>
Collision avoidance system by steering as some limitations: over-dependence on lane markings, sensor limitations, and interaction between driver and system.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vinnova.se/en/p/improved-impact-of-collision-avoidance-by-steering-technology-on-real-life-safety/ |title=Improved Impact of Collision Avoidance by Steering Technology on Real Life Safety |website=Vinnova |location=Stockholm, Sweden |access-date=3 November 2019}}</ref>.

==History==
Early warning systems were attempted as early as the late 1950s. An example is [[Cadillac]], which developed a prototype vehicle named the [[Cadillac Cyclone]] which used the new radar technology to detect objects in front of the car with the radar sensors mounted inside \"nose cones\". It was deemed too costly to manufacture.

The first modern forward collision avoidance system was demonstrated in 1995 by a team of scientists and engineers at [[Hughes Research Laboratories]] in [[Malibu, California]]. The project was funded by [[Delco Electronics]], and was led by HRL physicist Ross D. Olney. The technology was marketed as ''Forewarn''. The system was radar based{{snd}} a technology that was readily available at [[Hughes Electronics]], but not commercially elsewhere. A small custom fabricated radar antenna was developed specifically for this automotive application at 77&nbsp;GHz.<ref>{{citation|title=Collision Warning System Technology |first=R.D. |last=Olney |work=Intelligent Transport Systems World Congress |location=Yokohama, Japan |date=November 1995|display-authors=etal}}</ref> In August 1997, the first production laser adaptive cruise control on a Toyota vehicle was introduced on the [[Celsior]] model (Japan only).

In 2008, AEB was introduced in the British market.<ref name=\"trid.trb.org\">{{cite conference |url=https://trid.trb.org/view/1483883 |title=AEB Performance in the UK; A Decade of Development |last1=Sari |first1=Zahra |last2=Brookes |first2=David |last3=Avery |first3=Matthew |conference=25th International Technical Conference on the Enhanced Safety of Vehicles |publisher=Transportation Research Board |location=US |date=5 June 2017 |access-date=8 June 2019

In the early-2000s, the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) studied whether to make frontal collision warning systems and [[lane departure warning system]]s mandatory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/DOT/NHTSA/NRD/Multimedia/PDFs/Crash%20Avoidance/2003/HS809574Report.pdf |title=Forward Collision Warning Requirements Project Final Report - Task 1 |date=January 2003 |publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration |accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref> In 2011, the European Commission investigated the stimulation of \"collision mitigation by braking\" systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2011-011477+0+NOT+XML+V0//EN|title=Written question{{snd}} Rear-end traffic collisions in the European Union - E-011477/2011|work=europa.eu|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> Mandatory fitting (extra cost option) of [[Advanced Emergency Braking System]]s in commercial vehicles was scheduled to be implemented on 1 November 2013 for new vehicle types and on 1 November 2015 for all new vehicles in the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2011-011477&language=EN |title=Answer to a written question - Rear-end traffic collisions in the European Union - E-011477/2011|work=europa.eu|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> According to the \"impact assessment\",<ref>{{cite web|work=Commission of the European Communities |date=23 May 2008 |url= http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/automotive/files/safety/sec_2008_1908_en.pdf |title=Annex to the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning type-approval requirements for the general safety of motor vehicles - Impact Assessment |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150623232541/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/automotive/files/safety/sec_2008_1908_en.pdf |archivedate=23 June 2015 |accessdate=31 March 2016}}</ref> this could prevent around 5,000 fatalities and 50,000 serious injuries per year across the EU.

In March 2016, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) and the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] announced the manufacturers of 99% of U.S. automobiles had agreed to include automatic emergency braking systems as standard on virtually all new cars sold in the U.S. by 2022.<ref name=\"NHTSA2016\">{{cite web|title=U.S. DOT and IIHS announce historic commitment of 20 automakers to make automatic emergency braking standard on new vehicles|url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/us-dot-and-iihs-announce-historic-commitment-20-automakers-make-automatic-emergency|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=17 March 2016|date=17 March 2016}}</ref> In Europe, there was a related agreement about an AEBS or AEB in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/03/19/automakers-government-auto-braking-agreement/|title=Automakers agree to make auto braking a standard by 2022|publisher=}}</ref> [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) has announced that this kind of system will become mandatory for new heavy vehicles starting in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/press/pr2011/11trans_p10e.html|title=UNECE works on new standards to increase the safety of trucks and coaches|publisher=}}</ref> AEBS is regulated by UNECE regulation 131.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/2015/R131r1e.pdf |title=Uniform provisions concerning the approval of motor vehicles with regard to the Advanced Emergency Braking Systems (AEBS) |publisher=United Nations |date=27 February 2014 |access-date=21 October 2019}}</ref>.

==Benefits==
A 2012 study<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/news/rss/pr070312.html|title=Crash avoidance features cut insurance claims |publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |location=US |access-date=4 April 2015}}</ref> by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety examined how particular features of crash-avoidance systems affected the number of claims under various forms of insurance coverage. The findings indicate that two crash-avoidance features provide the biggest benefits: (a) ''autonomous braking'' that would brake on its own, if the driver does not, to avoid a forward collision, and (b) ''adaptive headlights'' that would shift the headlights in the direction the driver steers. They found lane departure systems to be not helpful, and perhaps harmful, at the circa 2012 stage of development. A 2015 Insurance Institute for Highway Safety study found forward collision warning and automatic braking systems reduced [[Rear-end collision|rear collisions]].<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.autonews.com/article/20160128/OEM06/160129871/automatic-braking-reduces-rear-end-crashes-iihs-study-finds |title=Automatic braking reduces rear-end crashes, IIHS study finds |journal=Automotive News |first=Ryan |last=Beene |date=28 January 2016 |accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref>

A 2015 study based on European and Australasian data suggests the AEB can decrease rear-end collisions by 38%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://etsc.eu/new-study-confirms-real-world-safety-benefits-of-autonomous-emergency-braking/ |title=New study confirms real-world safety benefits of autonomous emergency braking |publisher=European Transport Safety Council |date=11 July 2015 |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>

In the [[2016 Berlin attack|2016 Berlin terror attack]], a [[car-ramming attack|truck was driven into]] the Berlin [[Christmas market]] and was brought to a stop by its automatic braking system.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.dw.com/en/automatic-brakes-stopped-berlin-truck-during-christmas-market-attack/a-36936455 | title = Automatic brakes stopped Berlin truck during Christmas market attack |work = Deutsche Welle | date=28 December 2016}}</ref> Collision avoidance features are rapidly making their way into the new vehicle fleet. In a study of police-reported crashes, automatic emergency braking was found to reduce the incidence of rear-end crashes by 39 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/frontend/iihs/documents/masterfiledocs.ashx?id=2111|title=Effectiveness of Forward Collision Warning Systems with and without Autonomous Emergency Braking in Reducing Police-Reported Crash Rates|last=Cicchino|first=Jessica|date=2016|publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430034800/http://www.iihs.org/frontend/iihs/documents/masterfiledocs.ashx?id=2111|archivedate=30 April 2016}}</ref> A 2012 study suggests that if all cars feature the system, it will reduce accidents by up to 27 percent and save up to 8,000 lives per year on European roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh0YTnWp3CI|title=Euro NCAP - Autonomous Emergency Braking AEB|last=euroncapcom|date=13 June 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/08/05/eu-legislation-requires-cars-to-include-autonymous-braking/|title=New EU legislation requires cars to include autonomous braking system|publisher=}}</ref>

A 2016 US study on trucks, considering 6,000 CAS activations from over 3 million miles and 110,000 hours driving performed with year 2013 technology, find that CAS activations were the result of lead vehicle actions, such as braking, turning, switching lanes, or merging.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fleetowner.com/technology/nhtsa-study-collision-avoidance-systems-can-reduce-crashes |title=NHTSA study: Collision avoidance systems can reduce crashes |first=Sean |last=Kilcarr |website=Fleet Owner |date=2016-06-16 |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>

In the UK and in the US, third party damages and costs have decreased by 10% and 40% according to some insurances.<ref name=\"thatcham.org\"/>

Efficiency varies depending on analysis, according to the European Commission<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/sites/roadsafety/files/pdf/ersosynthesis2018-adas.pdf |title=Advanced driver assistance systems 2018 |publisher=European Road Safety Observatory |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>:
* 38% drop in accidents according to Fildes, 2015
* 9%-20% drop in collision according to Volvo
* 44% drop according to Ciccino

In April 2019, IIHS/HLDI considered real-world benefits of crash avoidance technologies, based on rates of police-reported crashes and insurance claims. Forward collision warning plus autobrake is associated to a 50% decrease in front to rear crashes and a 56% decrease in front to rear crashes with injuries, while forward collision warning alone is associated with only a 27% decrease in front to rear crashes and an only 20% decrease in front to rear crashes with injuries. The rear automatic braking is considered to have generate a 78% decrease on backing crashes (when combined with rear view camera and parking sensor). However, repair costs with this equipment are an average of {{USD|109}} higher due to the sensors being in areas prone to damage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.iihs.org/media/259e5bbd-f859-42a7-bd54-3888f7a2d3ef/EiyeBQ/Topics/ADVANCED%20DRIVER%20ASSISTANCE/IIHS-real-world-CA-benefits-0419.pdf |title=Real-word benefits of crash avoidance technologies |publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |location=US |date=April 2019 |access-date=15 June 2019}}</ref>

==Features==
Several features are commonly found across collision avoidance systems.

AEB systems shall detect possible collisions with the car in front.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.howsafeisyourcar.com.au/aeb/ |title=Car Safety Feature - Auto Emergency Braking (AEB) |work=Howsafeisyourcar.com.au |location=Australia |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref> It performs it with sensors to detect and classify things in front of the vehicle, a system to interpret the data from the sensors, and a braking system which can work autonomously.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/33a3/170f469edad9147fa2a70544f47e6354cf90.pdf |title=Potential Benefits of Autonomous Emergency Braking Based on In-depth Crash Reconstruction and Simulation |first1=Robert |last1=Anderson |first2=Samuel |last2=Doecke |first3=James |last3=Macken |publisher=Centre for Automotive Safety Research, The University of Adelaide |location=Australia |id=Paper Number 13-0152 |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>

Some cars may implement [[lane departure warning system]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Umar Zakir Abdul |first=Hamid |title=Current Collision Mitigation Technologies for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems–A Survey |journal=PERINTIS eJournal |date=2016 |volume=6 |issue=2 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311981545 |display-authors=etal|accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref>

===Pedestrian detection===
Since 2004, Honda has developed a [[automotive night vision|night vision]] system that highlights pedestrians in front of the vehicle by alerting the driver with an audible chime and visually displaying them via HUD. Honda's system only works in temperatures below 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit). This system first appeared on the [[Honda Legend]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ae-plus.com/key%20topics/kt-safety-news7.htm |title=Safety - Honda's Intelligent Night Vision system |work=Automotive Engineer PLUS |date=October 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808135950/http://www.ae-plus.com/key%20topics/kt-safety-news7.htm |archive-date=8 August 2008}}</ref>

To assist in pedestrian safety as well as driver safety, Volvo implemented a pedestrian [[airbag]] in the [[Volvo V40 (2012–2019)|Volvo V40]], introduced in 2012.
Many more manufacturers are developing [[Pedestrian crash avoidance mitigation]] (PCAM) systems.

===ANCAP reports===
Since 2018, the ANCAP provides AEB rating and tests AEB features.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-advice/aeb-or-auto-emergency-braking-not-all-systems-are-created-equal-71160 |title=AEB or auto emergency braking: Not all systems are created equal |work=CarsGuide |location=Australia |date=26 February 2018 |first=Tom |last=White |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref> 

The ANCAP report in its adult occupant protection section contains AEB rating taking into account AEB City from 10 to 50&nbsp;km/h.

The ANCAP report in its vulnerable user protection section contains AEB rating taking into account both AEB and FCW for pedestrian and cyclists,  with various speeds named \"Operational from\" (for instance 10 to 80&nbsp;km/h) in the reports:
* For pedestrians in day and night: adult crossing, child running, and adult walking along.
* For cyclists in day only: cyclist crossing, cyclist traveling along.

The ANCAP report in its safety assist section contains AEB rating taking into account the AEB interurban with various speeds named \"Operational from\" (for instance 10 to 180&nbsp;km/h):
* HMI performance
* FCW (stationary and slower moving car)
* AEB interurban (car braking lightly, car braking heavily, driving toward slower moving car)

===Reverse automatic braking===
In the US by 2017, 5% of cars were capable of reverse automatic braking. This feature allows autonomous braking of the vehicle while working in reverse direction, to avoid a reverse collision. Those systems are assessed by IIHS.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/iihs-reverse-automatic-braking-testing/ |title=IIHS begins testing reverse automatic braking |first=Andrew |last=Krok |work=Roadshow |publisher=CNN |location=US |date=22 February 2018|access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>

==Limitations and safety issues==

A [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] communication suggests that some vehicle collision avoidance assist systems are not able to detect damaged [[crash attenuator]]s. Therefore the vehicle may drive into the crash attenuator. The NTSB considers such a feature would be a must have for safety with partial automated vehicles to detect potential hazards and warn of potential hazards to drivers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/Documents/2020-HWY18FH011-BMG-abstract.pdf |title=Collision Between a Sport Utility Vehicle Operating With Partial Driving Automationand a Crash Attenuator |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] |location=California, US |id=HWY18FH011 |date=2018-03-23 |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

==Automobile manufacturers==
Various vendors provide AEB components to automakers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Francis |first=Sam |title=ADAS: Top 40 advanced driver assistance systems companies |url= https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2019/04/19/top-40-advanced-driver-assistance-systems-companies/21983/ |publisher=Robotics and Automation News |date=19 April 2019 |accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref> The global automotive AEB system market consists of a few established companies that are manufacturers or suppliers of specialized AEB components or systems.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Top 6 Vendors in the Global Automotive Advanced Emergency Braking System Market from 2016 to 2020: Technavio |url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160921005936/en/Top-6-Vendors-Global-Automotive-Advanced-Emergency |publisher=Business Wire |date=21 September 2016 |accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref> For example, the main vendors for radar systems include [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], [[Aptiv|Delphi]], [[Denso]], [[TRW Automotive|TRW]], and [[Continental AG|Continental]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Sedgwick |first=David |title=Demand skyrockets for collision-avoidance sensors |url= https://www.autonews.com/article/20141013/OEM06/310139961/demand-skyrockets-for-collision-avoidance-sensors |publisher=Automotive News |date=13 October 2014 |accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref> Automobile manufactures may describe the systems installed on their vehicles using different names to differentiate their marketing efforts.<ref name=\"thatcham.org\"/> A particular automaker may have systems and sensors sourced from a variety of suppliers.<ref name=\"Naranjo\">{{cite web |last=Naranjo |first=Michelle |title=Forward-Collision Warning Systems Are Not All Created Equal |url= https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/forward-collision-warning-systems-are-not-all-created-equal/ |publisher=Consumer Reports |date=25 February 2016 |accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref> Therefore, even a single car brand may offer various levels of technology sophistication and the: frequency of false alerts can be different from model to model and trim level to trim level, depending on the types of camera and/or laser-based systems installed.<ref name=\"Naranjo\"/>

In countries, such as the UK, one quarter of new vehicles might have some kind of AEB system; but only 1% of previously sold cars might have AEB.<ref name=\"thatcham.org\"/>

===Audi===
\"Pre sense\" autonomous emergency braking system uses twin [[radar]] and monocular camera sensors<ref>{{cite press release|url= http://www.bosch-presse.de/TBWebDB/en-US/PressText.cfm?id=4570 |title=Extensive safety in the new Audi A8 |publisher=Bosch Media Services |date=27 April 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100921045137/http://www.bosch-presse.de/TBWebDB/en-US/PressText.cfm?id=4570 |archivedate=21 September 2010 }}</ref> and was introduced in 2010 on the 2011 [[Audi A8#Third generation (D4, Typ 4H; 2009–present)|Audi A8]].<ref>{{cite press release|url= http://www.audimedia.ca/media/assets/0/110/278/a53962d1-394e-46f1-b8cf-a9f174de5019.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170803223156/http://www.audimedia.ca/media/assets/0/110/278/a53962d1-394e-46f1-b8cf-a9f174de5019.pdf |url-status= dead |archive-date=3 August 2017 |title=The new Audi A8|accessdate=17 February 2010}}</ref>
\"Pre sense plus\" works in four phases. The system first provides warning of an impending accident, activating hazard warning lights, closing windows and sunroof, and pretensioning front seat belts. The warning is followed by light braking to get the driver's attention. The third phase initiates autonomous partial braking at a rate of {{cvt|3|m/s2|ft/s2|1}}. The fourth phase increases braking to {{cvt|5|m/s2|ft/s2|1}} followed by automatic full braking power, roughly half a second before projected impact. \"Pre sense rear\", is designed to reduce the consequences of rear-end collisions. The sunroof and windows are closed and seat belts are prepared for impact. The seats are moved forward to protect the car's occupants. 2015 introduced the \"avoidance assistant\" system that intervenes in the steering to help the driver avoid an obstacle. If an accident occurs, the \"turning assistant\" monitors opposing traffic when turning left at low speeds. In critical situation, it brakes the car. \"Multicollision brake assist\" uses controlled braking maneuvers during the accident to aid the driver. Both systems were introduced on the [[Audi Q7 PHEV|Second generation Q7]].<ref>{{cite press release|url= https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/press-releases/the-new-audi-q7-sportiness-efficiency-premium-comfort-410 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190519213927/https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/press-releases/the-new-audi-q7-sportiness-efficiency-premium-comfort-410 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 19 May 2019 |title=The new Audi Q7 – Sportiness, efficiency, premium comfort |publisher=Audi Media Center |date=12 December 2014}}</ref>

===BMW===
In 2012 [[BMW]] introduced two systems on the [[BMW 7 Series (F01)#2012 update|7 Series]]. \"Active Protection\" detects imminent accidents to pretension safety belts, close windows and moonroof, bring backrest of the front passenger seat to an upright position, and activate post-crash braking. A [[driver drowsiness detection]] includes an advice to take a break from driving. An \"Active Driving Assistant\" combines [[Lane departure warning system|lane departure warning]], pedestrian protection, and city collision mitigation.<ref>{{cite press release|url= https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0126929EN/the-new-bmw-7-series?language=en|title=The new BMW 7 Series|date=25 May 2012|publisher=BMW Group}}</ref>

In 2013, \"Driving Assistant Plus\" was introduced on most models combining the front-facing camera, lane-departure warning, and in some cases front radar sensors to detect vehicles ahead. Should the driver not react to the warning of a potential collision, the system would gradually prime brake pressure and apply{{snd}} with maximum deceleration power{{snd}} if necessary. In the case of a crash, the system can bring the vehicle to a standstill. Later iterations of the system on cars equipped with Automatic Cruise Control system are improved by combining radar and camera detection during fog, rain, and other situations where normal camera operations may be compromised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwusanews.com/newsrelease.do?id=1864&mid=|title=Model Year 2014 Update Information|date=16 October 2013|first=Matthew|last=Russel|publisher=BMW USA News}}</ref>

===Ford===
[[File:Collision Warning Brake Support.jpg|thumb|Collision warning and brake support on the 2009 [[Lincoln MKS]] ]]
Beginning on the 2012 Ford Focus, Active City Stop was offered on the range topping Titanium model, under the optional Sports Executive Pack. The system used windscreen mounted cameras, radars, and lidars to monitor the road ahead. The system doesn't provide a warning, rather, it can prevent a crash occurring at speeds between {{convert|3.6|and|30|km/h|abbr=on}}. This speed was later raised to {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}}, and was available on all models, the Trend, Sport, Titanium, ST, and RS (Limited Edition only).

===General Motors===
[[General Motors]]' collision alert system was introduced in [[GMC Terrain]] SUVs in 2012. It uses a camera to provide warning when there is a vehicle ahead or there is a lane departure.<ref>{{cite press release|url= https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gmc/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Sep/0929_terrain.html |title=New Camera-Based Collision Alert Debuts on GMC Terrain |work=media.gm.com|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>
The 2014 [[Chevrolet Impala]] received the radar- and camera-based crash imminent braking (radar technology detects a possible crash threat and alerts the driver.

If ignored, the second stage would include the E-Pretensioner's tugging on the shoulder portion of the seat belt two to three times as an additional tactile warning to the driver to take action. The third stage, in which the CMBS predicts that a collision is unavoidable, includes full seat belt slack takeup by the E-Pretensioner for more effective seat belt protection and automatic application of the brakes to lessen the severity of the predicted crash. The E-Pretensioner would also work to reduce seat belt slack whenever the brakes are applied and the brake assist system is activated.<ref name=\"world.honda.com\" />

===Mercedes-Benz===
2002: Mercedes' \"Pre-Safe\" system was exhibited at the [[Paris Motor Show]] on the 2003 [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W220)|S-Class]]. Using [[electronic stability control]] sensors to measure steering angle, vehicle yaw, and lateral acceleration and [[brake assist]] (BAS) sensors to detect emergency braking, the system can tighten the seat belts, adjust seat positions, including rear seats (if installed), raise folded rear headrests (if installed), and close the sunroof if it detects a possible collision (including rollover).<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.mercedes-benz.ca/index.cfm?NewsID=121&id=2959 |title=MERCEDES-BENZ LAUNCHES FIRST-EVER CAR WITH \"REFLEXES\" - New Pre-Safe System Anticipates Collisions to Protect Occupants |date=15 October 2002 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071008151232/http://www.mercedes-benz.ca/index.cfm?NewsID=121&id=2959 |archive-date=8 October 2007 |access-date=14 March 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> A later version of the Pre-Safe system was supplemented by an additional function that can close any open windows if necessary.

Visual and acoustic warnings are triggered when a hazard is spotted. If the driver then reacts by braking, the braking power will be boosted as the situation requires, up to a full brake application. Should the driver fail to react, Pre-Safe Brake triggers autonomous vehicle braking. Pedestrian detection is active up to about {{convert|72|km/h|abbr=on}} , and is able to reduce collisions with pedestrians autonomously from an initial speed of up to {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/> A radar sensor in the rear bumper monitors the traffic behind the vehicle. If the risk of an impact from the rear is detected, the rear hazard warning lights are activated to alert the driver of the vehicle behind (not on vehicles with USA/Canada coding). Anticipatory occupant protection measures, such as the reversible belt tensioners, are deployed. If the vehicle is stopped and the driver indicates a wish to remain stationary{{snd}} by depressing the brake pedal, activating the hold function, or moving the selector lever to \"P\"{{snd}} the system increases the brake pressure to keep the vehicle firmly braked during a possible rear-end collision.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/> Pre-Safe Impulse works an early phase of the crash, before the resulting deceleration starts to increase, the front occupants are pulled away from the direction of impact and deeper into their seats by their seat belts. By the time the accident enters the phase when loads peak, the extra distance they are retracted by can be used while dissipating energy in a controlled fashion. Pre-acceleration and force limitation allow the occupants to be temporarily isolated from the effects of the crash, significantly reducing the risk and severity of injuries in a frontal collision.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/>

===Nissan===
Nissan's [[Infiniti]] brand offers both [[lidar|laser-based]] and [[radar|radar-based]] systems.  Brake assist with preview function anticipates the need to apply emergency braking and pre-pressurize the brake system to help improve brake response. Intelligent brake assist (IBA) with forward emergency braking (FEB) (on QX80) uses radar to monitor approaching speed to the vehicle ahead, helping detect an imminent collision. It provides a two-stage warning to alert the driver, and if the driver takes no action, the system automatically engages the brakes to mitigate the collision speed and impact. Predictive forward collision warning system warns the driver of risks that may be obscured from the driver's view. It senses the relative velocity and distance of a vehicle directly ahead, as well as a vehicle travelling in front of the preceding one. The forward emergency braking system judges that deceleration is required, it alerts the driver using both a screen display and sound, then generates a force that pushes the accelerator pedal up and applies partial braking to assist the driver in slowing the vehicle down. When the system judges that there is the possibility of a collision, it will automatically apply harder braking to help avoid one.

===Subaru===
Subaru's system, branded \"EyeSight\", was announced in May 2008 using stereo camera technology to detect pedestrians and bicyclists. As initially announced, EyeSight enabled pre-collision braking control and adaptive cruise control at all speeds.<ref name=PR-100422>{{cite press release |url=https://www.subaru.co.jp/en/news/archives/contents/pdf_en_59361.pdf |title=FHI to Introduce the \"New EyeSight\" Subaru's Unique Driving Assist System with Advanced Safety Functions |date=22 April 2010 |publisher=Subaru Corporation |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref> It was rolled out in Japan to selected models in 2010; in Australia in 2011; and in North America in 2013 model year Legacy and Outback models.<ref name=PR-120316>{{cite press release |url=https://www.media.subaru-global.com/en/news/1472 |title=FHI to Introduce the \"EyeSight\" to North America - The Second Overseas Launch of Subarufs ''[sic]'' Unique Driving Assist System |date=16 March 2012 |publisher=Subaru Corporation |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref>
An alarm is used to warn the driver of a potential collision hazard in the pre-collision system. The pre-collision braking control was upgraded in 2010 to allow the vehicle to stop automatically if the speed difference between the EyeSight-equipped vehicle and the object in front is less than {{convert|30|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and the driver takes no action to slow down or stop. Above {{convert|30|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, the vehicle will reduce its speed automatically.<ref name=PR-100422 /> It also allows the vehicle to engage braking assist, if there is a risk of a frontal collision and the driver suddenly applies the brakes.<ref name=PR-100422 /> The speed difference to allow an automatic stop was raised to {{convert|50|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 2013 with improved cameras.<ref name=PR-131002 />
The adaptive cruise control was also upgraded in 2010 to allow automatic emergency braking in traffic, fully stopping the EyeSight vehicle when the car in front has come to a complete stop.<ref name=PR-100422 /> In 2013, color was added to the cameras, allowing the system to recognize brake lights and red stoplights ahead.<ref name=PR-131002>{{cite press release |url=https://www.media.subaru-global.com/en/news/1755 |title=FHI Reveals the Next Generation \"EyeSight\" |date=22 April 2010 |publisher=Subaru Corporation |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref>
Subaru also added an active lane-keeping (keeping the vehicle in the middle of the lane, and applying steering force to keep the vehicle in the lane when unintentionally crossing lane markers) and throttle management (to prevent sudden unintended acceleration in forward and reverse) systems in 2013 with the improved cameras.<ref name=PR-131002 />

[[File:Lexus Pre-Collision System frontal.jpg|thumb|2008 LS 600h forward PCS diagram, with radar (<span style=\"background:SkyBlue\">blue</span>) and [[stereo camera]] (<span style=\"background:pink\">red</span>) coverage]]

Toyota's pre-collision system (PCS) is a [[radar|radar-based]] system that uses a forward-facing millimeter-wave radar. When the system determines that a frontal collision is unavoidable, it preemptively tightens the [[seat belt]]s, removing any slack, and pre-charges the brakes using [[brake assist]] to give the driver maximum stopping power when the driver depresses the brake pedal.

2003 February: Toyota launched PCS in the redesigned [[Japanese domestic market]] [[Toyota Harrier|Harrier]].

2003 August: added an automatic partial pre-crash braking system to the [[Lexus LS#Third generation (XF30)|Celsior]].<ref>{{cite news| url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3012/is_/ai_n6173980 | work=Automotive Industries | title=Safety matters: advanced crash avoidance technology finds its way into production vehicles in Japan | year=2004}}</ref>

2006: Pre-collision system with [[Driver Monitoring System]] introduced in March 2006 on the [[Lexus GS (S190)|Lexus GS 450h]]<ref name=\"toyota-global.com\"/> using a [[CCD camera]] on the steering column. This system monitors the driver's face to determine where the driver is looking. If the driver's head turns away from the road and a frontal obstacle is detected, the system will alert the driver using a buzzer, and if necessary, pre-charge the brakes and tighten the safety belts.

2006: the [[Lexus LS (XF40)|Lexus LS]] introduced an advanced pre-collision system (APCS), added a twin-lens stereo camera located on the windshield and a more sensitive radar to detect smaller \"soft\" objects such as animals and pedestrians. A near-infrared projector located in the headlights allows the system to work at night. With the adaptive variable suspension (AVS) and electric power steering, the system can change the [[shock absorber]] firmness, steering gear ratios, and torque assist to aid the driver's evasive steering measures. The lane departure warning system will make automatic steering adjustments to help ensure that the vehicle maintains its lane in case the driver fails to react. Driver Monitoring System was introduced on the Lexus LS. Rear-end pre-collision system includes a rearward-facing millimeter-wave radar mounted in the rear bumper.<ref>{{cite press release|url= http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/news/06/0825.html|title=Toyota: News Releases|work=toyota.co.jp|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> The system adjusts the active head restraints by moving them upward and forward to reduce the risk of [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] injuries if an imminent rear collision is detected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/nrd-01/esv/esv20/07-0146-O.pdf |first=Kiyoka |last=Matsubayashi |first2=Yukinori |last2=Yamada |first3=Motomi |last3=Iyoda |first4=Shin |last4=Koike |first5=Tomoya |last5=Kawasaki |first6=Masanori |last6=Tokuda |title=Development of Rear Pre-Crash Safety System For Rear-End Collisions |publisher=Toyota Motor |accessdate=10 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105536/http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/nrd-01/esv/esv20/07-0146-O.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

This system is designed to work even if the driver is wearing sunglasses, and at night.

2008: PCS with [[GPS]]-[[automotive navigation system|navigation]] linked brake assist function on the [[Toyota Crown Hybrid|Crown]]. The system is designed to determine if the driver is late in decelerating at an approaching stop sign, will then sound an alert and can also pre-charge the brakes to provide braking force if deemed necessary. This system works in certain Japanese cities and requires Japan specific road markings that are detected by a camera.

2006: Volvo's \"Collision Warning with Auto Brake\", developed in cooperation with [[Mobileye]], was introduced on the 2007 [[Volvo S80|S80]]. This system is powered by a radar/camera sensor fusion and provides a warning through a [[head up display]] that visually resembles brake lamps. If the driver does not react, the system pre-charges the brakes and increases the brake assist sensitivity to maximize driver braking performance. Later versions will automatically apply the brakes to minimize pedestrian impacts. In some models of Volvos, the automatic braking system can be manually turned off. The [[Volvo V40 (2012–2019)|V40]] also included the first pedestrian [[airbag]], when it was introduced in 2012.

2013: Volvo introduced the first [[cyclist detection]] system. All Volvo automobiles now come standard with a [[lidar]] laser sensor that monitors the front of the roadway, and if a potential collision is detected, the safety belts will retract to reduce excess slack. Volvo now includes this safety device as an option in FH series trucks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ridS396W2BY|title=Volvo Trucks - Emergency braking at its best!|work=YouTube|access-date=25 January 2015}}</ref>

==New car assessment program==
[[EuroNCAP]] and [[C-NCAP]] and ANCAP are involved in taking into account the Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) in their respective [[New Car Assessment Program]].<ref name=\"globalncap.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.globalncap.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Market-for-Vehicle-Safety.pdf |title=Creating a Global Market for Vehicle Safety |publisher=Global New Car Assessment Programme |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>

Since 2016, EuroNCAP takes into account pedestrian in AEB rating.<ref name=\"globalncap.org\"/>

In 2018, EuroNCAP provides assessments for AEB city (since 2014), AEB interurban (since 2014), AEB pedestrian (since 2018), and AEB cyclist (since 2018). Since 2018, ANCAP also provides assessments for AEB city, AEB interurban, AEB pedestrian and cyclist.

==Cost==
Many vehicles have AEB fitted as standard. The AEB is not available for every car. When AEB is available as an option, its cost can be in the £180 (AEB city only){{snd}} £1300 (regular AEB) range.<ref name=\"thatcham.org\"/>

However, due to various reason, the cost of AEB is linked to the cost of ACC and FCW.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://circabc.europa.eu/sd/a/3ab87fdc-5715-4733-af50-c3608034ca56/report_aebs_en.pdf |title=Automated Emergency Brake Systems: Technical requirements, costs and benefits |first1=C. |last1=Grover |first2=I. |last2=Knight |first3=F. |last3=Okoro |first4=I. |last4=Simmons |first5=G. |last5=Couper |first6=P. |last6=Massie |first7=B. |last7=Smith |publisher=European Commission |date=April 2008 |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>

'''Bordeaux''' ({{IPA-fr|bɔʁdo|-|Fr.Bordeaux.ogg}}; [[Gascon language|Gascon]] {{lang-oc|Bordèu}} {{IPA-oc|buɾˈðɛw|}}) is a port city on the [[Garonne]] in the [[Gironde]] [[Departments of France|department]] in Southwestern [[France]].

The municipality ([[Communes of France|commune]]) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of the [[Bordeaux Métropole]] that has a population of 783,081 (2017) and includes its [[suburb]]s and close [[satellite town]]s. With 1,195,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth-largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, and Lille. It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.

Being at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, [[Vinexpo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706075152/http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique/ |archivedate=6 July 2009}}</ref> and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5&nbsp;billion euros each year. [[Bordeaux wine]] has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/6249110.stm |title=In pictures: New World Heritage sites |work=BBC News |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref> After Paris, Bordeaux has the highest number of preserved historical buildings of any city in France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action|title=Commanderie|website=commanderie.org|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref>

[[File:Bituriges Vivisci.jpg|thumb|left|Coins of the [[Bituriges Vivisci]], 5th–1st century BC, derived from the coin designs of [[Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul]]. [[Cabinet des Médailles]].]]

Around 300 BC the region was the settlement of a [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribe]], the [[Bituriges Vivisci]], named the town '''Burdigala''', probably of [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] origin.

In 107 BC the [[Battle of Burdigala]] was fought by the Romans who were defending the [[Allobroges]], a [[Gauls|Gallic tribe]] allied to Rome, and the [[Tigurini]] led by [[Divico]]. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle. <ref> {{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |author=Sivan, H., R. Mathisen |accessdate=March 29, 2020 11:18 pm |publisher=Pleiades}} </ref>

The city came under [[ancient Rome|Roman]] rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for [[tin]] and [[lead]]. <ref>https://www.romanports.org/en/the-ports/116-burdigala.html  | title=Burdigala(France)  |accessdate=March 29, 2020 11:39 pm </ref> It continued to flourish, especially during the [[Severan dynasty]] (3rd century), and acquired the status of capital of [[Gallia Aquitania|Roman Aquitaine]]. In 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.

[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-Étienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]
In the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.

In 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.

In 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).

During the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760–768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).

In 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed. 

Although the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English. <ref> https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux </ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between. <ref>https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>
==== 12th century to the 20th century  ====
From the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|Eléonore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. André]] was built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cathédrale St-André was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. <ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref>. It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362–1372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory. 

In 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only regained its importance during the 16th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], along with its traditional wine exports.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>

Bordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.
[[File:Edouard Manet 026.jpg|thumb|[[Édouard Manet]]: ''Harbour at Bordeaux'', 1871]]
[[File:Bordeaux rue Sainte-Catherine avril 1905.jpg|thumb|right|Rue Sainte-Catherine in 1905]]

The 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux.<ref> https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action </ref> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Baron Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.

Towards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.

In 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref> This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands. However, on the last of these occasions the French capital was soon moved again to [[Vichy]]. In May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.

From 1940 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.

== Geography ==
Bordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.

=== Climate ===
Bordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.

Winters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971–2000</ref>

== Economy ==
Bordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.

{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is €32.7 Billion.

=== Wine ===
{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}

The wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>

Bordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (châteaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from Médoc and one, Château Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:

Both red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carménère]].

White Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[Sémillon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Château d'Yquem]].

Because of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.

The [[Cité du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cité du vin cernée par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>

=== Others ===
The [[Laser Mégajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.

Some 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].

Tourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelink.co.uk/articles/country-information/france/3-best-places-to-retire-in-france.html|title=3 Best Places to Retire in France|publisher=Globelink.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>

Access to the [[Port de la Lune|port]] from the Atlantic is via the [[Gironde estuary]]. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.

== Population ==
At the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. Bordeaux in its hey day had a population of 262,662 in 1968.<ref name=\"commune_pop2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&ref_id=nattef01214|title=Taille des communes les plus peuplées en 2012 |publisher=INSEE |accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref> The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of [[Italian people|Italians]], [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Germans]]. https://www.citypopulation.de/php/france-gironde.php?cityid=33063.

== Politics ==
At the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to [[Ségolène Royal]] of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], president of the UMP. Then came [[François Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then Ségolène Royal with 25.87%, followed by François Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave Ségolène Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for Ségolène Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round. This is an earthquake in Bordeaux, a city deeply rooted right traditions{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

In the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragué]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragué]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Juppé]] confronted the General Counsel PS Michèle Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Juppé was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Michèle Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Michèle Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Juppé, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, Noël Mamère was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, Noël Mamère was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.

In 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Juppé and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of Ségolène Royal and [[Michèle Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Juppé who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.

In the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology José Bové came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:

UMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front Gérard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.

There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.

Bordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont François Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009–2012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.
Another bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc – La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>

Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.

=== Rail ===
The main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express régional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[Périgueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le Médoc, Angoulême and [[Bayonne]].

Historically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.

The two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.

Since July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.

=== Air ===
Bordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[Mérignac, Gironde|Mérignac]].

[[File:Aéroport Bx Mérignac.JPG|thumb|[[Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport]]]]

=== Trams, buses and boats ===
[[File:Bordeaux-lawn-track-&-vines1.jpg|thumb|Tramway in Bordeaux]]
Bordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux Métropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:
* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])
* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)
* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)
* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre
* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river
This network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.

There had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.

The planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le tracé du tramway qui va desservir l'aéroport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>

=== Taxis ===
There are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.

===Public transportation statistics===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is {{convert|7|km|abbr=on}}, while 8% travel for over {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_France_Bordeaux-924|title=Bordeaux Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|accessdate=June 19, 2017}} [[File:CC-BY_icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].</ref>

== Sport ==
[[File:Bordeaux Stade Lescure entrée.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the Stade Chaban-Delmas]]{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}

The 41,458-capacity [[Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux]] is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].

There are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux Bègles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].
Skateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.

Bordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.

There is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], Vélodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.

The 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.

Between 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>

'''Bordeaux''' ({{IPA-fr|bɔʁdo|-|Fr.Bordeaux.ogg}}; [[Gascon language|Gascon]] {{lang-oc|Bordèu}} {{IPA-oc|buɾˈðɛw|}}) is a port city on the [[Garonne]] in the [[Gironde]] [[Departments of France|department]] in Southwestern [[France]].

The municipality ([[Communes of France|commune]]) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of the [[Bordeaux Métropole]] that has a population of 783,081 (2017) and includes its [[suburb]]s and close [[satellite town]]s. With 1,195,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth-largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, and Lille. It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.

Being at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, [[Vinexpo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706075152/http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique/ |archivedate=6 July 2009}}</ref> and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5&nbsp;billion euros each year. [[Bordeaux wine]] has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/6249110.stm |title=In pictures: New World Heritage sites |work=BBC News |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref> After Paris, Bordeaux has the highest number of preserved historical buildings of any city in France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action|title=Commanderie|website=commanderie.org|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref>
== History == 
==== 5th Century Bc to the 11th Century  ====
{{See also|Timeline of Bordeaux}}
[[File:Bituriges Vivisci.jpg|thumb|left|Coins of the [[Bituriges Vivisci]], 5th–1st century BC, derived from the coin designs of [[Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul]]. [[Cabinet des Médailles]].]]

Around 300 BC the region was the settlement of a [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribe]], the [[Bituriges Vivisci]], named the town '''Burdigala''', probably of [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] origin.

In 107 BC the [[Battle of Burdigala]] was fought by the Romans who were defending the [[Allobroges]], a [[Gauls|Gallic tribe]] allied to Rome, and the [[Tigurini]] led by [[Divico]]. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle. <ref> {{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |author=Sivan, H., R. Mathisen |accessdate=March 29, 2020 11:18 pm |publisher=Pleiades}} </ref>

The city came under [[ancient Rome|Roman]] rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for [[tin]] and [[lead]]. <ref>https://www.romanports.org/en/the-ports/116-burdigala.html  | title=Burdigala(France)  |accessdate=March 29, 2020 11:39 pm </ref> It continued to flourish, especially during the [[Severan dynasty]] (3rd century), and acquired the status of capital of [[Gallia Aquitania|Roman Aquitaine]]. In 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.

[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-Étienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]
In the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.

In 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.

In 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).

During the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760–768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).

In 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed. 

Although the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English. <ref> https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux </ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between. <ref>https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>
==== 12th century to the 20th century  ====
From the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|Eléonore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. André]] was built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cathédrale St-André was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. <ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref>. It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362–1372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory. 

In 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only regained its importance during the 16th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], along with its traditional wine exports.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>

Bordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.

[[File:Bordeaux rue Sainte-Catherine avril 1905.jpg|thumb|right|Rue Sainte-Catherine in 1905]]

The 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux.<ref> https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action </ref> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Baron Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.

Towards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.

In 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref> This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands. However, on the last of these occasions the French capital was soon moved again to [[Vichy]]. In May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.

From 1940 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.

== Geography ==
Bordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.

=== Climate ===
Bordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.

Winters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971–2000</ref>

== Economy ==
Bordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.

{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is €32.7 Billion.

=== Wine ===
{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}

The wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>

Bordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (châteaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from Médoc and one, Château Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:

Both red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carménère]].

White Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[Sémillon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Château d'Yquem]].

Because of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.

The [[Cité du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cité du vin cernée par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>

=== Others ===
The [[Laser Mégajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.

Some 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].

Tourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelink.co.uk/articles/country-information/france/3-best-places-to-retire-in-france.html|title=3 Best Places to Retire in France|publisher=Globelink.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>

Access to the [[Port de la Lune|port]] from the Atlantic is via the [[Gironde estuary]]. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.

== Population ==
At the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. Bordeaux in its hey day had a population of 262,662 in 1968.<ref name=\"commune_pop2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&ref_id=nattef01214|title=Taille des communes les plus peuplées en 2012 |publisher=INSEE |accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref> The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of [[Italian people|Italians]], [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Germans]]. https://www.citypopulation.de/php/france-gironde.php?cityid=33063.

The built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to [[urban sprawl]], so that by the January 2011 census there were 1,140,668 people living in the overall [[Metropolitan Area (France)|metropolitan area]] of Bordeaux,<ref name=\"AU10_pop\"/> only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.

== Politics ==
At the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to [[Ségolène Royal]] of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], president of the UMP. Then came [[François Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then Ségolène Royal with 25.87%, followed by François Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave Ségolène Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for Ségolène Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round. This is an earthquake in Bordeaux, a city deeply rooted right traditions{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

In the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragué]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragué]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Juppé]] confronted the General Counsel PS Michèle Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Juppé was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Michèle Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Michèle Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Juppé, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, Noël Mamère was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, Noël Mamère was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.

In 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Juppé and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of Ségolène Royal and [[Michèle Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Juppé who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.

In the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology José Bové came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:

UMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front Gérard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.

[[Virginie Calmels]] is Deputy Mayor of Bordeaux in charge of the Economy, Employment and Sustainable Growth and Vice-President of the Urban Community of Bordeaux.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.informazione.it/c/22FF78F3-5D9D-45BF-A731-AD6F19FC51C0/ASSYSTEM-Virginie-Calmels-joins-the-Assystem-Board-of-Directors|title=ASSYSTEM : Virginie Calmels joins the Assystem Board of Directors|work=Informazione - Comunicati Stampa|access-date=2017-09-19|language=it-IT}}</ref>

Bordeaux is the capital of five cantons and the Prefecture of the [[Gironde]] and [[Aquitaine]].

The town is divided into three districts, the first three of Gironde. The headquarters of Urban Community of Bordeaux Mériadeck is located in the neighbourhood and the city is at the head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry that bears his name.

The number of inhabitants of Bordeaux is greater than 199,999 and less than 250,000 and so the number of municipal councilors is 61. They are divided according to the following composition:

=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===
Europe's longest-span [[vertical-lift bridge]], the [[Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is {{convert|117|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and can be lifted vertically up to {{convert|53|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to let tall ships pass underneath. The €160 million bridge was inaugurated by President [[François Hollande]] and Mayor Alain Juppé on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.

=== Shopping ===
Bordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and cafés; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Comédie'' by the ''Grand Théâtre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Comédie'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.

== Culture ==
[[File:GrandTheatreBordeaux2.jpg|thumb|Maison de l’Économie Créative et de la Culture en Aquitaine]]
[[File:RB 20200222 Bordeaux-11.jpg|thumb|Maison de l’Économie Créative et de la Culture en Aquitaine]]
Bordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, ''[[Arc en rêve]]''.{{citation needed |date=January 2018}} Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the [[Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux|Opéra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.

== Transport ==
=== Road ===
Bordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.

Bordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont François Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009–2012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.
Another bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc – La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>

Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.

=== Rail ===
The main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express régional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[Périgueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le Médoc, Angoulême and [[Bayonne]].

Historically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.

The two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.

Since July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.

=== Air ===
Bordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[Mérignac, Gironde|Mérignac]].

[[File:Aéroport Bx Mérignac.JPG|thumb|[[Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport]]]]

=== Trams, buses and boats ===
[[File:Bordeaux-lawn-track-&-vines1.jpg|thumb|Tramway in Bordeaux]]
Bordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux Métropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:
* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])
* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)
* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)
* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre
* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river
This network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.

There had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.

The planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le tracé du tramway qui va desservir l'aéroport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>

=== Taxis ===
There are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.

===Public transportation statistics===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is {{convert|7|km|abbr=on}}, while 8% travel for over {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_France_Bordeaux-924|title=Bordeaux Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|accessdate=June 19, 2017}} [[File:CC-BY_icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].</ref>

== Sport ==
[[File:Bordeaux Stade Lescure entrée.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the Stade Chaban-Delmas]]{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}

The 41,458-capacity [[Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux]] is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].

There are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux Bègles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].
Skateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.

Bordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.

There is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], Vélodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.

The 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.

Between 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>

'''''Ramones''''' is the debut studio album by American [[punk rock]] band [[Ramones]], released on April 23, 1976 by [[Sire Records]]. After ''[[Hit Parader]]'' editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, she wrote about them in an article and contacted [[Danny Fields]], insisting that he be their manager. Fields agreed and convinced [[Craig Leon]] to produce ''Ramones'', and the band recorded a [[demo (music)|demo]] for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president [[Seymour Stein]] to listen to the band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album. They used similar sound-output techniques{{clarify|date=August 2019}} to those of [[the Beatles]] and used advanced production methods by Leon.

The album cover, photographed by [[Punk (magazine)|''Punk'']] magazine's Roberta Bayley, features the four members leaning against a brick wall in [[New York City]]. The record company paid only $125 for the front photo, which has since become one of the most imitated album covers of all time. The back cover depicts an eagle belt buckle along with the album's [[liner notes]]. After its release, ''Ramones'' was promoted with two [[single (music)|singles]], which failed to chart. The Ramones also began touring to help sell records; these tour dates were mostly based in the United States, though two were booked in Britain.

Violence, drug use, relationship issues, humor, and [[Nazism]] were prominent in the album's lyrics. The album opens with \"[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]\", which is among the band's most recognized songs. Most of the album's tracks are [[uptempo]], with many songs measuring at well over 160 beats per minute. The songs are also rather short; at two-and-a-half minutes, \"I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement\" is the album's longest track. ''Ramones'' contains a [[cover version|cover]] of the [[Chris Montez]] song \"[[Let's Dance (Chris Montez song)|Let's Dance]]\".

''Ramones'' peaked at number 111 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was unsuccessful commercially, though it received glowing reviews from critics. Many later deemed it a highly influential record, and it has since received many accolades, such as the top spot on [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'' magazine's]] list of the \"50 Most Essential Punk Records\". ''Ramones'' is considered an influential punk album in the US and UK, and had a significant impact on other genres of [[rock music]], such as [[grunge]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. The album was ranked at number 33 in ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s 2012 list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/ramones-ramones-20120524 |title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time: Ramones, 'Ramones' |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref> and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 2014.<ref name=\"RIAA\">{{cite web|title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum |url= https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Ramones&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |website= RIAA.com |publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America]]| accessdate=2014-06-07| archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6QA1g5yY2|archivedate=2014-06-07| url-status= dead}}</ref>

==Background==
The [[Ramones]] began playing gigs in mid-1974, with their first show at Performance Studios in [[New York City]].<ref name= \"HallofFame\"/> The band, performing in a style similar to the one used on their debut album, typically performed at clubs in [[Lower Manhattan|downtown Manhattan]], specifically [[CBGB]] and [[Max's Kansas City]].<ref>Melnick & Meyer 2003, p. 33.</ref> In early 1975, [[Lisa Robinson]], an editor of ''Hit Parader'' and ''Rock Scene'', saw the fledgling Ramones performing at CBGB and subsequently wrote about the band in several magazine issues. The group's vocalist [[Joey Ramone]] related that \"Lisa came down to see us, she was blown away by us. She said that we changed her life; she started writing about us in ''Rock Scene'', and then [[Lenny Kaye]] would write about us and we started getting more press like ''[[The Village Voice]]''. Word was getting out, and people starting coming down.\"<ref name=\"Rombes 65\"/> Convinced that the band needed a recording contract, Robinson contacted [[Danny Fields]], former manager of [[the Stooges]], and argued that he needed to manage the band. Fields agreed because the band \"had everything [he] ever liked,\"<ref name=\"Rombes 65\">Rombes 2005, p. 65.</ref> and became the manager in November 1975.<ref name=\"ramones 66\">Rombes 2005, p. 66.</ref>

On September 19, 1975, the Ramones recorded a [[Demo (music)|demo]] at [[914 Sound Studios]], which was produced by [[Marty Thau]]. Featuring the songs \"[[Judy Is a Punk]]\" and \"[[I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend]]\", the band used the demo to showcase their style to prospective labels.<ref name=\"True 51\"/><ref>Porter 2004, p. 43.</ref> Producer [[Craig Leon]], who had seen the Ramones perform in the summer of 1975, brought the demo to the attention of [[Sire Records]]' president [[Seymour Stein]].<ref name=\"ramones 66\"/><ref name=\"porter 37\"/><ref>True 2005, p. 50.</ref> After being persuaded by Craig Leon and his ex-wife [[Linda S. Stein|Linda Stein]], the Ramones auditioned at Sire and were offered a contract, although the label had previously signed only European [[progressive rock]] bands.<ref name=\"True 51\">True 2005, p. 51.</ref><ref name=\"l 126\">Leigh 2009, p. 126.</ref> Drummer [[Tommy Ramone]] recalled: \"Craig Leon is the one who got us signed, single handed. He brought down the vice president and all these people—he's the only hip one in the company. He risked his career to get us on the label.\"<ref name=\"ramones 66\"/><ref>Rombes 2005, p. 67.</ref> The label offered to release \"You're Gonna Kill That Girl\" as a single, but the band declined, insisting on recording an entire album. Sire accepted their request and agreed to release a [[studio album]] instead.<ref name=\"porter 37\">Porter 2004, p. 37.</ref><ref>Melnick & Meyer 2007, p. 62.</ref>

==Recording and production==
[[File:Radio City Music Hall Panorama.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A building in a city at night that reads \"RADIO CITY\" in all caps lit up in various places around the building|''Ramones'' was recorded on the eighth floor of [[Radio City Music Hall]].]]
In January 1976 the band took a break from their live performances to prepare for recording at Plaza Sound studio.<ref name=\"Leigh 131\"/> Sessions began later that month and were completed within a week for $6,400;<ref name=\"l 128\">Leigh 2009, p. 128.</ref><ref name=\"notes\"/> the instruments took three days and the vocal parts were recorded in four days.<ref name=\"Rombes 2005 p. 69\">Rombes 2005, p. 69.</ref> In 2004, Leon admitted that they recorded ''Ramones'' quickly due to budget restrictions, but also that it was all the time they needed.<ref name=\"Rombes 2005 p. 73\">Rombes 2005, p. 73.</ref>

{{quotebox|quote=\"Doing an album in a week and bringing it in for $6,400 was unheard of, especially since it was an album that really changed the world. It kicked off [[punk rock]] and started the whole thing—as well as us.\"|source=—Joey Ramone<ref>McNeil & McCain 2009, p. 229.</ref>|align=left|width=25%}}

The band applied microphone placement techniques similar to those which many orchestras used.<ref>Rombes 2005, p. 72.</ref> The recording process was a deliberate exaggeration of the techniques used by [[the Beatles]] in the early 1960s, with a four-track representation of the devices. The guitars can be heard separately on the stereo channels—electric bass on the left channel, rhythm guitar on the right—drums and vocals are mixed in the middle of the stereo mix.<ref>Savage 2002, p. 143.</ref> The mixing of the production also used more modern techniques such as [[overdubbing]], a technique used by studios to add a supplementary recorded sound to the material. The band also used a technique known as [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubling]], where the vocal line used is sung twice.<ref name=\"Rombes 2005 p. 73\"/>

Recording for the album was expanded by [[Mickey Leigh]] (Joey's brother) and Leon with percussion effects, which went unmentioned in the liner notes to the album's release.<ref name=\"Leigh 131\"/> Author Nicholas Rombes said that the production's quality sounded like \"the ultimate do-it-yourself, amateur, reckless ethic that is associated with punk,\" but concluded that they approached the recording process with a \"high degree of preparedness and professionalism.\"<ref>Rombes 2005, p. 5.</ref>

==Artwork and packaging==
[[File:Ramones back cover.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=An image that is primarily black and white ([[monochrome]]) photo which consists of small writing on the upper side and a bald eagle belt buckle on the bottom side.|The back cover to the Ramones album was designed by artist [[Arturo Vega]], who produced the photo of a belt buckle in a [[photo booth]].<ref name=\"rombes 75\">Rombes 2005, p. 75.</ref>]]
Initially, the Ramones wanted an album cover similar to ''[[Meet the Beatles!]]'' (1964) and subsequently had pictures taken in that style by Danny Fields but Sire was dissatisfied with the results. The art direction was by Toni Wadler and, according to cartoonist [[John Holmstrom]], the \"Meet The Beatles\" cover idea came out \"horribly\".<ref name=\"Leigh 138\">Leigh 2009, p. 138.</ref> Wadler later chose a photo by Roberta Bayley, a photographer for [[Punk (magazine)|''Punk'' magazine]] for the cover. The black and white photograph on the front of the album was originally in an issue of ''Punk''.

The cover photo features (from left to right) [[Johnny Ramone|Johnny]], Tommy, Joey and [[Dee Dee Ramone]], staring at the camera with blank faces. They are all wearing ripped/faded blue jeans and leather jackets, standing upright against the brick wall of a private community garden called Albert's Garden, located in the [[Bowery]] neighborhood of New York City between Bowery Street and Second Street.<ref name=\"rombes 75\"/><ref name=\"Leigh 138\"/> The stance of the group members in the photograph would influence their future cover designs as well, with the majority of their succeeding albums using a picture of the band on the front cover.<ref name=\"rombes 75\"/> Music historian [[Legs McNeil]] states that \"Tommy [is] standing on his tip-toes and Joey [is] hunched over a bit.\"<ref name=\"Leigh 138\"/> The back cover art, which depicts a belt buckle with a bald eagle and the band's logo, was designed by [[Arturo Vega]].<ref name=\"rombes 75\"/> [[Liner notes]] on the back cover fail to acknowledge [[backing vocalist]]s and additional instrument players. Leigh, who performed backing vocals on several tracks, asked guitarist Johnny why he was not mentioned on the record's credits. Johnny replied: \"We didn't want people to get confused with who's in the band or who's not. It's our first album, you know, and we didn't want people to get confused.\"<ref name=\"Leigh 138\"/>

The artwork became one of the most imitated album covers in music. The image of a band in front of a brick wall dressed in ripped jeans and leather jackets was copied by [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]] in ''[[Chipmunk Punk]]''.<ref name=\"Leigh 138\"/> ''Ramones''{{'}}s artwork was ranked number 58 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s 1991 list of 100 Greatest Album Covers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=100 Greatest Album Covers|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=1991-11-14}}</ref>

===Touring===
[[File:Ramones Toronto 1976.jpg|thumb|right|240px|alt=A black and white picture of a rock band with four members shown performing on stage.|The Ramones performing in 1976 in [[Toronto]].]]
In 1974 the band played 30 performances, nearly all at the New York-based club CBGB. All but one of the band's 1975 gigs were booked for New York City, with [[Waterbury, Connecticut]] as the exception. After the album's recording, the Ramones headlined for very few shows, usually opening for an identified [[cover band]] which played [[Aerosmith]] and [[Boston (band)|Boston]]. When they opened at [[Brockton, Massachusetts]], the audience appeared extremely uninterested in the Ramones so Johnny swore off playing as an introduction for other bands.<ref>Leigh 2009, p. 136.</ref> Following this, Fields booked several headlining shows around the [[New York metropolitan area|Tri-state area]], and they began playing frequently at gigs like CBGB and Max's Kansas City. After performing with [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] in New Jersey, they continued their tour to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] for three shows.<ref name=\"leigh 137\"/> Leigh later said of the tour:

{{Quote|Travelling was difficult. Most of the time, it was just Danny Fields, me, and the members of the band. We'd get two rooms in the hotel, three of us in each. They couldn't afford any more help at that point, so the band had to pitch in unloading the equipment. I'd play the drums during sound checks, while Tommy went out to the board and mixed the sound—and instructed the soundman not to fuck with the settings. We would enlist the aid of any fan willing to help us load out at the end of the night.<ref name=\"leigh 137\">Leigh 2009, p. 137.</ref>}}

At the time, Leigh was [[road manager]], [[Stage management|stage manager]], [[chauffeur]], and head of security. Vega, who contributed to the album's packaging, helped out with the [[road crew]] as much as possible. Tommy's friend Monte Melnick occasionally helped with the [[audio engineer|audio output]], but this was typically done by Leigh.<ref name=\"leigh 137\"/>

Following their debut album's release, the band performed at over 60 concerts for its promotion.<ref name=\"bessman\"/> While most of the gigs were booked in North America, two dates—July 4 and 5—were in London's [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse venue]] and [[Dingwalls]], respectively. Linda Stein pushed to make these events happen, setting up the band performances in the UK during the [[United States Bicentennial]]. Fields relates: \"On the two-hundredth anniversary of our freedom, we were bringing Great Britain a gift that was forever going to disrupt their sensibilities.\"<ref>Leigh 2009, p. 146.</ref> The band sold out for their first London performance, with an audience of roughly 3,000.<ref>Leigh 2009, pp. 147–149.</ref> Leigh described the Dingwalls gig as very similar to performances at CBGB.<ref>Leigh 2009, p. 150.</ref> Likewise, these venues in future were headlined by other punk bands like [[the Clash]] and [[Sex Pistols]].<ref name=\"bessman\"/><ref>Bowe 2010, p. 6.</ref> The band performed over 100 concerts the following year.<ref name=\"bessman\">Bessman 1993, pp. 31–35.</ref>

==Lyrics and composition==
The songs on ''Ramones'' addressed several lyrical themes including violence, male [[prostitute|prostitution]], drug use, and [[Nazism]]. While the moods displayed in the album were often dark,<ref>Sabin 2002, p. 164.</ref> Johnny said that when writing the lyrics they were not \"trying to be offensive.\"<ref>{{cite video | people= Jim Fields (director) Michael Gramaglia (director) | date= 2003-01-19 | title= End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones | url= http://www.endofthecentury.com/ | format= DVD | medium= Motion picture | publisher= [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]]/[[Sire Records]] | location= United States | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100722110757/http://www.endofthecentury.com/ | archivedate= 2010-07-22 | accessdate= 2010-06-04 | time= 20:25 – 20:45 | url-status= dead }}</ref> Many songs from the album have backing vocals from different guests.

The opening '''\"Blitzkrieg Bop\"''' was written by Tommy, and originally named \"Animal Hop\".<ref name=\"Leigh 120\">Leigh 2009, p. 120.</ref> Once Dee Dee reviewed the lyrics, the band changed the wording, the name, and partially the theme.<ref name=\"Leigh 121\">Leigh 2009, p. 121.</ref> According to Tommy, the song's original concept was about \"kids going to a show and having a good time\", but the theme became more Nazi-related after its revision.<ref name=\"Leigh 121\"/> The piece begins with an [[instrumental]] interval which lasts about 20 seconds.

'''\"Beat on the Brat\"''' was said by Joey to have origins relating to the [[upper class]] of New York City. Dee Dee, however, explained that the song was about how Joey saw a mother \"going after a kid with a bat in his [apartment building's] lobby and wrote a song about it.\"<ref>McNeil & McCain 2009, p. 183.</ref>

'''\"Judy Is a Punk\"''' – written around the same time as \"Beat on the Brat\" — was written by Joey after he walked by Thorny Croft, an apartment building \"where all the kids in the neighborhood hung out on the rooftop and drank.\"<ref name=\"True 60\">True 2005, p. 60.</ref> The song's lyrics are fictional and refer to two juvenile offenders in [[Berlin]] and [[San Francisco]] and their possible deaths at the conclusion of the song.<ref name=\"True 60\"/> \"Judy Is a Punk\" is the original album's shortest track at 1:39.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/ramones-the-ramones/5700009?EAN=81227430627 |title=<nowiki>Ramones [Expanded</nowiki>&#93;, The Ramones, Music CD – Barnes & Noble |publisher=Music.barnesandnoble.com |date=2001-06-19 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref>

'''\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\"''' – the album's slowest song – was solely written by Tommy and pays homage to [[love songs]] by [[pop music]] acts of the 1960s. The song used a [[12-string guitar]], [[glockenspiel]], and [[tubular bells]] in its composition,<ref name=\"icon 543\">Schinder & Schwartz 2007, p. 543.</ref> and was said by author Scott Schinder to be an \"unexpected romantic streak\".<ref name=\"icon 539\">Schinder & Schwartz 2007, p. 539.</ref>

'''\"Chain Saw\"''' opens with the sound of a running [[circular saw]] and was influenced by the 1974 [[horror film]] ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''. At nearly 180 beats per minute, \"Chain Saw\" had the fastest [[tempo]] of the album's songs and, according to Rombes, is the most \"home-made\" sounding.<ref>Rombes 2005, p. 85.</ref>

'''\"[[Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue]]\"''' contains four lines of minimalist lyrics that depict youthful boredom and [[Intoxicative inhalant|inhaling solvent vapors]] found in glue. \"I hope no one thinks we really sniff glue,\" said Dee Dee. \"I stopped when I was eight [years old].\"<ref name=\"Rombes 86\">Rombes 2005, p. 86.</ref> Dee Dee also explained that its concept came from adolescent trauma.<ref name=\"Rombes 86\"/> After several songs by the Ramones whose titles began with \"I Don't Want to&nbsp;...\", Tommy said that \"Now I Want to Sniff Some Glue\" is the first positive piece on the album.<ref name=\"True 60\"/> The song served as an inspiration for one of the first punk [[fanzine]]s, [[Mark Perry (musician)|Mark Perry]]'s ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]''.<ref name=\"True 60\"/><ref>Savage 2002, p. 182.</ref>

'''\"I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement\"''' is also minimalist, and inspired by horror movies. The entire text is composed of three lines, and the composition was based on three [[major chord]]s. With a playing time of 2:35, it is the longest piece on the album.<ref name=\"Rombes 86\"/> (Asked about the [[public toilet|bathroom]] at [[CBGB]], [[Debbie Harry]] remarked: \"I think that song from the Ramones is partially about that: 'I don't wanna go down to the basement ... ' As kids, we never wanted to go down to the basement cos it was so dark and scary. And that toilet was certainly very scary.\")<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Marcel|last=Anders|title=I was criticised for being too sexual. But it was innocent compared to today|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #197|date=June 2014|p=54}}</ref>

'''\"Loudmouth\"''' has six major chords and is harmonically complex. The song's lyrics are — depending on the reading and punctuation — a single row or four very brief lines.<ref>Rombes 2005, p. 87.</ref>

'''\"Havana Affair\"''' has a lyrical concept incorporating the comic strip ''[[Spy vs. Spy]]'' by Cuban-born illustrator [[Antonio Prohias]].<ref name=\"Rombes 88\">Rombes 2005, p. 88.</ref><ref>Dowel; Halperin; Mangus 2006, p. 55.</ref> At roughly 170 beats per minute, \"Loudmouth\" and \"Havana Affair\" proceed at about the same tempo.<ref name=\"Rombes 88\"/>

\"Havana Affair\" segues into '''\"Listen to My Heart\"''' – the first of many Ramones songs to voice an ironic and pessimistic perspective on a failing or failed relationship.<ref name=\"Rombes 88\"/>

The song \"53rd and 3rd\" is based on the street's reputation for male prostitution.]]

Written solely by Dee Dee, the lyrics of '''\"[[53rd & 3rd|53rd and 3rd]]\"''' concern a male prostitute (\"rent boy\"), waiting at the corner of [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Street]] and [[Third Avenue]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. When the prostitute gets a customer, he kills the customer with a razor to prove he is not a homosexual.<ref>McNeil & McCain 2009, p. 215.</ref> In interviews, Dee Dee described the piece as autobiographical. \"The song speaks for itself,\" Dee Dee commented in an interview. \"Everything I write is autobiographical and written in a very real way, I can't even write.\"<ref>Porter 2004, p. 50.</ref> Johnny insisted that the song is about \"Dee Dee turning tricks.\"<ref name=\"Leigh 132\">Leigh 2009, p. 134.</ref> The half-sung and half-shouted bridge in \"53rd and 3rd\" are performed by Dee Dee, whose voice is described by author Cyrus Patell as what \"breaks the deliberate aural monotony of the song and emphasizes the violence of the lyric.\"<ref>Patell 2011, pp. 132–133.</ref>

'''\"[[Let's Dance (Chris Montez song)|Let's Dance]]\"''' is a [[cover version]] of the hit song by [[Chris Montez]]<ref name=\"Leigh 135\"/>, featuring Leon playing Radio City's large [[Wurlitzer]] [[pipe organ]].<ref name=\"icon 543\"/>

'''\"I Don't Want to Walk Around with You\"''' consists of two lyric lines and three major chords. One of the group's earliest compositions, written at the beginning of 1974, it was the opener on their first [[demo (music)|demo]].<ref name=\"icon 539\"/><ref>True 2005, p. 23.</ref>

\"I Don't Wanna Walk Around with You\" [[Segue#In_music|segues]] into the closing track '''\"Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World\"''', which refers to a [[Hitler Youth]] member.<ref name=\"Leigh 131\">Leigh 2009, p. 131.</ref><ref name=\"Leigh 132\"/> [[Seymour Stein]] complained about its original lyrics — \"I'm a Nazi, baby, I'm a Nazi, yes I am. I'm a Nazi Schatze, y'know I fight for the Fatherland\" — insisting the track was offensive. When he threatened to remove the track from the album, the band put together alternate lyrics: \"I'm a shock trooper in a stupor, yes I am. I'm a Nazi Schatze, y'know I fight for the Fatherland.\" Stein accepted the revision and it was duly released.<ref name=\"Leigh 132\"/><ref>Leigh 2009, p. 133.</ref>

''Ramones'' was released on April 23, 1976, by Sire Records and received glowing reviews. In May, [[John Rockwell]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' published a rave review, saying: \"What the Ramones do is deliver a nonstop set of short, brisk, monochromatically intense songs. ... conventional considerations of pace and variety are thrown calculatedly to the winds. The ingredients are simplicity itself.\" Rockwell noted: \"the effect in the end amounts to an abstraction of rock so pure that other associations get left behind.\"<ref>{{citation |first=John |last=Rockwell |title= Ramones Sire SASD 7520 |date=21 May 1976 |page=82}}</ref> [[Nick Kent]] favourably commented in the ''[[NME]]'': \"This record poses a direct threat to any vaguely sensitive woofer and/or tweeter lodged in your hi-fi ...\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Kent |title=Ramones - ''Ramones'' (Sire records import) |work=NME |date=15 May 1976}}</ref> Reviewing that same month in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', [[Robert Christgau]] said that, while the power of the band's music draws from \"fairly ominous sources\" like Nazi imagery and brutality, he cannot deny the \"sheer pleasure\" of the music: \"For me, it blows everything else off the radio: it's clean the way [[New York Dolls|the Dolls]] never were, sprightly the way [[the Velvet Underground|the Velvets]] never were, and just plain listenable the way [[Black Sabbath (band)|Black Sabbath]] never was.\"<ref name=\"christgau\">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=1976-05-14|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv6-76.php|title=Christgau's Consumer Guide|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|accessdate=2013-05-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325152117/http://robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv6-76.php|archivedate=2014-03-25|url-status=live}}</ref> In July, [[Paul Nelson (critic)|Paul Nelson]] of ''Rolling Stone'' wrote in 1976 that the album was similar to early [[rock and roll]], and was constructed using rhythm tracks of great intensity.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">[[Paul Nelson (critic)|Nelson, Paul]] (1976-07-29).

Later reviews of ''Ramones'' tended to praise the album's influence on rock music.

Regardless of this critical acclaim, ''Ramones'' was not successful commercially. It only reached No. 111 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],<ref name=\"charts\">[http://www.allmusic.com/album/ramones-mw0000691207/awards \"Ramones {{!}} Awards {{!}} AllMusic\"].

==Legacy and influence==
''Ramones'' is considered to have established the musical genre of [[punk rock]], as well as popularizing it years afterward. Rombes wrote that it offered \"alienated future rock\", and that it \"disconnected from tradition.\"<ref name=\"Rombes 2005 p. 40\">Rombes 2005, p. 40.</ref> The album was the start of the Ramones' influence on [[popular music]], with examples being genres such as [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]],<ref>Hoye 2003, p. 124.</ref> [[thrash metal]],<ref>{{cite web| author =Young, Charles M.| title =Johnny's Last Stand| work =Rolling Stone| date =2004-09-16| url =https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theramones/articles/story/6485108/johnnys_last_stand| accessdate =2009-11-05| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100707102258/http://punkrock.tribe.net/thread/fb000a6c-0d9b-4784-ad88-1bece7fa976e| archivedate =2010-07-07| url-status =dead}}</ref> [[indie pop]],<ref>{{cite web| author =Keene, Jarret| title =Candy Man| work =Tucson Weekly| date =2007-11-29| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131226104234/http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/candy-man/Content?oid=1089751| archivedate =2013-12-26| url =http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/candy-man/Content?oid=1089751| accessdate =2009-11-05| url-status =dead}}</ref> [[grunge]],<ref>Hurwitz 2006, p. 16.</ref> [[post-punk]],<ref>Roach 2003, pp. 60–63.</ref> and most notably, punk rock.<ref name=\"gd\">Doeden 2006, p. 10.</ref> The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] said of their influence on rock in general:

{{Quote|When the [Ramones] hit the street in 1976 with their self-titled first album, the rock scene, in general, had become somewhat bloated and narcissistic. The Ramones got back to basics: simple, speedy, stripped-down rock and roll songs. Voice, guitar, bass, drums. No makeup, no egos, no light shows, no nonsense. And though the subject matter was sometimes dark, emanating from a sullen adolescent basement of the mind, the group also brought cartoonish fun and high-energy excitement back to rock and roll.<ref name=\"HallofFame\">{{cite web | url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/ramones | date=2004-09-15 | title=Ramones | publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] | accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref>}}

Despite the lack of popularity in its era, the importance of the album for the development of punk rock music was incredible, influencing many of the most well-known names in punk rock, including [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[the Clash]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]], and [[Green Day]]. [[Billie Joe Armstrong]], singer for Green Day, explained his reasoning for listening to the band: \"they had songs that just stuck in your head, just like a hammer they banged right into your brain.\"<ref name=\"gd\"/> The album also had a great impact on the English punk scene as well, with the bassist for [[Generation X (band)|Generation X]], [[Tony James (musician)|Tony James]], saying that the album caused English bands to change their style. \"When their album came out,\" commented James, \"all the English groups tripled speed overnight. Two-minute-long songs, very fast.\"<ref>Doane 2012, p. 22.</ref> In another interview, James stated that \"Everybody went up three gears the day they got that first Ramones album. Punk rock—that rama-lama super fast stuff—is totally down to the Ramones. Bands were just playing in an [[MC5]] groove until then.\"<ref name=\"strongman 111\">Strongman 2008, p. 111.</ref> In 1999, ''Classic Albums'' by [[List of Collins GEM books|Collins GEM]] recognized ''Ramones'' as the start of English punk rock and called it the fastest and hardest music that could possibly be concocted, stating: \"The songs within were a short, sharp exercise in vicious speed-thrash, driven by ferocious guitars and yet halting in an instant. It was the simple pop dream taken to its minimalist extreme.\"<ref name=\"many reviews\"/> In 2012 the album was preserved by the [[National Recording Registry]], deeming it \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Registry Choices 2012: The National Recording Preservation Board (Library of Congress)|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2012reg.html|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref>

'''''Ramones''''' is the debut studio album by American [[punk rock]] band [[Ramones]], released on April 23, 1976 by [[Sire Records]]. After ''[[Hit Parader]]'' editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, she wrote about them in an article and contacted [[Danny Fields]], insisting that he be their manager. Fields agreed and convinced [[Craig Leon]] to produce ''Ramones'', and the band recorded a [[demo (music)|demo]] for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president [[Seymour Stein]] to listen to the band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album. They used similar sound-output techniques{{clarify|date=August 2019}} to those of [[the Beatles]] and used advanced production methods by Leon.

The album cover, photographed by [[Punk (magazine)|''Punk'']] magazine's Roberta Bayley, features the four members leaning against a brick wall in [[New York City]]. The record company paid only $125 for the front photo, which has since become one of the most imitated album covers of all time. The back cover depicts an eagle belt buckle along with the album's [[liner notes]]. After its release, ''Ramones'' was promoted with two [[single (music)|singles]], which failed to chart. The Ramones also began touring to help sell records; these tour dates were mostly based in the United States, though two were booked in Britain.

Violence, drug use, relationship issues, humor, and [[Nazism]] were prominent in the album's lyrics. The album opens with \"[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]\", which is among the band's most recognized songs. Most of the album's tracks are [[uptempo]], with many songs measuring at well over 160 beats per minute. The songs are also rather short; at two-and-a-half minutes, \"I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement\" is the album's longest track. ''Ramones'' contains a [[cover version|cover]] of the [[Chris Montez]] song \"[[Let's Dance (Chris Montez song)|Let's Dance]]\".

''Ramones'' peaked at number 111 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was unsuccessful commercially, though it received glowing reviews from critics. Many later deemed it a highly influential record, and it has since received many accolades, such as the top spot on [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'' magazine's]] list of the \"50 Most Essential Punk Records\". ''Ramones'' is considered an influential punk album in the US and UK, and had a significant impact on other genres of [[rock music]], such as [[grunge]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. The album was ranked at number 33 in ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s 2012 list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/ramones-ramones-20120524 |title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time: Ramones, 'Ramones' |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref> and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 2014.<ref name=\"RIAA\">{{cite web|title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum |url= https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Ramones&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |website= RIAA.com |publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America]]| accessdate=2014-06-07| archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6QA1g5yY2|archivedate=2014-06-07| url-status= dead}}</ref>

==Background==
The [[Ramones]] began playing gigs in mid-1974, with their first show at Performance Studios in [[New York City]].<ref name= \"HallofFame\"/> The band, performing in a style similar to the one used on their debut album, typically performed at clubs in [[Lower Manhattan|downtown Manhattan]], specifically [[CBGB]] and [[Max's Kansas City]].<ref>Melnick & Meyer 2003, p. 33.</ref> In early 1975, [[Lisa Robinson]], an editor of ''Hit Parader'' and ''Rock Scene'', saw the fledgling Ramones performing at CBGB and subsequently wrote about the band in several magazine issues. The group's vocalist [[Joey Ramone]] related that \"Lisa came down to see us, she was blown away by us. She said that we changed her life; she started writing about us in ''Rock Scene'', and then [[Lenny Kaye]] would write about us and we started getting more press like ''[[The Village Voice]]''. Word was getting out, and people starting coming down.\"<ref name=\"Rombes 65\"/> Convinced that the band needed a recording contract, Robinson contacted [[Danny Fields]], former manager of [[the Stooges]], and argued that he needed to manage the band. Fields agreed because the band \"had everything [he] ever liked,\"<ref name=\"Rombes 65\">Rombes 2005, p. 65.</ref> and became the manager in November 1975.<ref name=\"ramones 66\">Rombes 2005, p. 66.</ref>

On September 19, 1975, the Ramones recorded a [[Demo (music)|demo]] at [[914 Sound Studios]], which was produced by [[Marty Thau]]. Featuring the songs \"[[Judy Is a Punk]]\" and \"[[I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend]]\", the band used the demo to showcase their style to prospective labels.<ref name=\"True 51\"/><ref>Porter 2004, p. 43.</ref> Producer [[Craig Leon]], who had seen the Ramones perform in the summer of 1975, brought the demo to the attention of [[Sire Records]]' president [[Seymour Stein]].<ref name=\"ramones 66\"/><ref name=\"porter 37\"/><ref>True 2005, p. 50.</ref> After being persuaded by Craig Leon and his ex-wife [[Linda S. Stein|Linda Stein]], the Ramones auditioned at Sire and were offered a contract, although the label had previously signed only European [[progressive rock]] bands.<ref name=\"True 51\">True 2005, p. 51.</ref><ref name=\"l 126\">Leigh 2009, p. 126.</ref> Drummer [[Tommy Ramone]] recalled: \"Craig Leon is the one who got us signed, single handed. He brought down the vice president and all these people—he's the only hip one in the company. He risked his career to get us on the label.\"<ref name=\"ramones 66\"/><ref>Rombes 2005, p. 67.</ref> The label offered to release \"You're Gonna Kill That Girl\" as a single, but the band declined, insisting on recording an entire album. Sire accepted their request and agreed to release a [[studio album]] instead.<ref name=\"porter 37\">Porter 2004, p. 37.</ref><ref>Melnick & Meyer 2007, p. 62.</ref>

==Recording and production==
[[File:Radio City Music Hall Panorama.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A building in a city at night that reads \"RADIO CITY\" in all caps lit up in various places around the building|''Ramones'' was recorded on the eighth floor of [[Radio City Music Hall]].]]
In January 1976 the band took a break from their live performances to prepare for recording at Plaza Sound studio.<ref name=\"Leigh 131\"/> Sessions began later that month and were completed within a week for $6,400;<ref name=\"l 128\">Leigh 2009, p. 128.</ref><ref name=\"notes\"/> the instruments took three days and the vocal parts were recorded in four days.<ref name=\"Rombes 2005 p. 69\">Rombes 2005, p. 69.</ref> In 2004, Leon admitted that they recorded ''Ramones'' quickly due to budget restrictions, but also that it was all the time they needed.<ref name=\"Rombes 2005 p. 73\">Rombes 2005, p. 73.</ref>

{{quotebox|quote=\"Doing an album in a week and bringing it in for $6,400 was unheard of, especially since it was an album that really changed the world. It kicked off [[punk rock]] and started the whole thing—as well as us.\"|source=—Joey Ramone<ref>McNeil & McCain 2009, p. 229.</ref>|align=left|width=25%}}

The band applied microphone placement techniques similar to those which many orchestras used.<ref>Rombes 2005, p. 72.</ref> The recording process was a deliberate exaggeration of the techniques used by [[the Beatles]] in the early 1960s, with a four-track representation of the devices. The guitars can be heard separately on the stereo channels—electric bass on the left channel, rhythm guitar on the right—drums and vocals are mixed in the middle of the stereo mix.<ref>Savage 2002, p. 143.</ref> The mixing of the production also used more modern techniques such as [[overdubbing]], a technique used by studios to add a supplementary recorded sound to the material. The band also used a technique known as [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubling]], where the vocal line used is sung twice.<ref name=\"Rombes 2005 p. 73\"/>

Recording for the album was expanded by [[Mickey Leigh]] (Joey's brother) and Leon with percussion effects, which went unmentioned in the liner notes to the album's release.<ref name=\"Leigh 131\"/> Author Nicholas Rombes said that the production's quality sounded like \"the ultimate do-it-yourself, amateur, reckless ethic that is associated with punk,\" but concluded that they approached the recording process with a \"high degree of preparedness and professionalism.\"<ref>Rombes 2005, p. 5.</ref>

==Artwork and packaging==
[[File:Ramones back cover.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=An image that is primarily black and white ([[monochrome]]) photo which consists of small writing on the upper side and a bald eagle belt buckle on the bottom side.|The back cover to the Ramones album was designed by artist [[Arturo Vega]], who produced the photo of a belt buckle in a [[photo booth]].<ref name=\"rombes 75\">Rombes 2005, p. 75.</ref>]]
Initially, the Ramones wanted an album cover similar to ''[[Meet the Beatles!]]'' (1964) and subsequently had pictures taken in that style by Danny Fields but Sire was dissatisfied with the results. The art direction was by Toni Wadler and, according to cartoonist [[John Holmstrom]], the \"Meet The Beatles\" cover idea came out \"horribly\".<ref name=\"Leigh 138\">Leigh 2009, p. 138.</ref> Wadler later chose a photo by Roberta Bayley, a photographer for [[Punk (magazine)|''Punk'' magazine]] for the cover. The black and white photograph on the front of the album was originally in an issue of ''Punk''.

The cover photo features (from left to right) [[Johnny Ramone|Johnny]], Tommy, Joey and [[Dee Dee Ramone]], staring at the camera with blank faces. They are all wearing ripped/faded blue jeans and leather jackets, standing upright against the brick wall of a private community garden called Albert's Garden, located in the [[Bowery]] neighborhood of New York City between Bowery Street and Second Street.<ref name=\"rombes 75\"/><ref name=\"Leigh 138\"/> The stance of the group members in the photograph would influence their future cover designs as well, with the majority of their succeeding albums using a picture of the band on the front cover.<ref name=\"rombes 75\"/> Music historian [[Legs McNeil]] states that \"Tommy [is] standing on his tip-toes and Joey [is] hunched over a bit.\"<ref name=\"Leigh 138\"/> The back cover art, which depicts a belt buckle with a bald eagle and the band's logo, was designed by [[Arturo Vega]].<ref name=\"rombes 75\"/> [[Liner notes]] on the back cover fail to acknowledge [[backing vocalist]]s and additional instrument players. Leigh, who performed backing vocals on several tracks, asked guitarist Johnny why he was not mentioned on the record's credits. Johnny replied: \"We didn't want people to get confused with who's in the band or who's not. It's our first album, you know, and we didn't want people to get confused.\"<ref name=\"Leigh 138\"/>

The artwork became one of the most imitated album covers in music. The image of a band in front of a brick wall dressed in ripped jeans and leather jackets was copied by [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]] in ''[[Chipmunk Punk]]''.<ref name=\"Leigh 138\"/> ''Ramones''{{'}}s artwork was ranked number 58 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s 1991 list of 100 Greatest Album Covers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=100 Greatest Album Covers|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=1991-11-14}}</ref>

===Touring===
[[File:Ramones Toronto 1976.jpg|thumb|right|240px|alt=A black and white picture of a rock band with four members shown performing on stage.|The Ramones performing in 1976 in [[Toronto]].]]
In 1974 the band played 30 performances, nearly all at the New York-based club CBGB. All but one of the band's 1975 gigs were booked for New York City, with [[Waterbury, Connecticut]] as the exception. After the album's recording, the Ramones headlined for very few shows, usually opening for an identified [[cover band]] which played [[Aerosmith]] and [[Boston (band)|Boston]]. When they opened at [[Brockton, Massachusetts]], the audience appeared extremely uninterested in the Ramones so Johnny swore off playing as an introduction for other bands.<ref>Leigh 2009, p. 136.</ref> Following this, Fields booked several headlining shows around the [[New York metropolitan area|Tri-state area]], and they began playing frequently at gigs like CBGB and Max's Kansas City. After performing with [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] in New Jersey, they continued their tour to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] for three shows.<ref name=\"leigh 137\"/> Leigh later said of the tour:

{{Quote|Travelling was difficult. Most of the time, it was just Danny Fields, me, and the members of the band. We'd get two rooms in the hotel, three of us in each. They couldn't afford any more help at that point, so the band had to pitch in unloading the equipment. I'd play the drums during sound checks, while Tommy went out to the board and mixed the sound—and instructed the soundman not to fuck with the settings. We would enlist the aid of any fan willing to help us load out at the end of the night.<ref name=\"leigh 137\">Leigh 2009, p. 137.</ref>}}

At the time, Leigh was [[road manager]], [[Stage management|stage manager]], [[chauffeur]], and head of security. Vega, who contributed to the album's packaging, helped out with the [[road crew]] as much as possible. Tommy's friend Monte Melnick occasionally helped with the [[audio engineer|audio output]], but this was typically done by Leigh.<ref name=\"leigh 137\"/>

Following their debut album's release, the band performed at over 60 concerts for its promotion.<ref name=\"bessman\"/> While most of the gigs were booked in North America, two dates—July 4 and 5—were in London's [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse venue]] and [[Dingwalls]], respectively. Linda Stein pushed to make these events happen, setting up the band performances in the UK during the [[United States Bicentennial]]. Fields relates: \"On the two-hundredth anniversary of our freedom, we were bringing Great Britain a gift that was forever going to disrupt their sensibilities.\"<ref>Leigh 2009, p. 146.</ref> The band sold out for their first London performance, with an audience of roughly 3,000.<ref>Leigh 2009, pp. 147–149.</ref> Leigh described the Dingwalls gig as very similar to performances at CBGB.<ref>Leigh 2009, p. 150.</ref> Likewise, these venues in future were headlined by other punk bands like [[the Clash]] and [[Sex Pistols]].<ref name=\"bessman\"/><ref>Bowe 2010, p. 6.</ref> The band performed over 100 concerts the following year.<ref name=\"bessman\">Bessman 1993, pp. 31–35.</ref>

==Lyrics and composition==
The songs on ''Ramones'' addressed several lyrical themes including violence, male [[prostitute|prostitution]], drug use, and [[Nazism]]. While the moods displayed in the album were often dark,<ref>Sabin 2002, p. 164.</ref> Johnny said that when writing the lyrics they were not \"trying to be offensive.\"<ref>{{cite video | people= Jim Fields (director) Michael Gramaglia (director) | date= 2003-01-19 | title= End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones | url= http://www.endofthecentury.com/ | format= DVD | medium= Motion picture | publisher= [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]]/[[Sire Records]] | location= United States | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100722110757/http://www.endofthecentury.com/ | archivedate= 2010-07-22 | accessdate= 2010-06-04 | time= 20:25 – 20:45 | url-status= dead }}</ref> Many songs from the album have backing vocals from different guests.

The opening '''\"Blitzkrieg Bop\"''' was written by Tommy, and originally named \"Animal Hop\".<ref name=\"Leigh 120\">Leigh 2009, p. 120.</ref> Once Dee Dee reviewed the lyrics, the band changed the wording, the name, and partially the theme.<ref name=\"Leigh 121\">Leigh 2009, p. 121.</ref> According to Tommy, the song's original concept was about \"kids going to a show and having a good time\", but the theme became more Nazi-related after its revision.<ref name=\"Leigh 121\"/> The piece begins with an [[instrumental]] interval which lasts about 20 seconds.

'''\"Beat on the Brat\"''' was said by Joey to have origins relating to the [[upper class]] of New York City. Dee Dee, however, explained that the song was about how Joey saw a mother \"going after a kid with a bat in his [apartment building's] lobby and wrote a song about it.\"<ref>McNeil & McCain 2009, p. 183.</ref>

'''\"Judy Is a Punk\"''' – written around the same time as \"Beat on the Brat\" — was written by Joey after he walked by Thorny Croft, an apartment building \"where all the kids in the neighborhood hung out on the rooftop and drank.\"<ref name=\"True 60\">True 2005, p. 60.</ref> The song's lyrics are fictional and refer to two juvenile offenders in [[Berlin]] and [[San Francisco]] and their possible deaths at the conclusion of the song.<ref name=\"True 60\"/> \"Judy Is a Punk\" is the original album's shortest track at 1:39.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/ramones-the-ramones/5700009?EAN=81227430627 |title=<nowiki>Ramones [Expanded</nowiki>&#93;, The Ramones, Music CD – Barnes & Noble |publisher=Music.barnesandnoble.com |date=2001-06-19 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref>

'''\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\"''' – the album's slowest song – was solely written by Tommy and pays homage to [[love songs]] by [[pop music]] acts of the 1960s. The song used a [[12-string guitar]], [[glockenspiel]], and [[tubular bells]] in its composition,<ref name=\"icon 543\">Schinder & Schwartz 2007, p. 543.</ref> and was said by author Scott Schinder to be an \"unexpected romantic streak\".<ref name=\"icon 539\">Schinder & Schwartz 2007, p. 539.</ref>

'''\"Chain Saw\"''' opens with the sound of a running [[circular saw]] and was influenced by the 1974 [[horror film]] ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''. At nearly 180 beats per minute, \"Chain Saw\" had the fastest [[tempo]] of the album's songs and, according to Rombes, is the most \"home-made\" sounding.<ref>Rombes 2005, p. 85.</ref>

'''\"[[Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue]]\"''' contains four lines of minimalist lyrics that depict youthful boredom and [[Intoxicative inhalant|inhaling solvent vapors]] found in glue. \"I hope no one thinks we really sniff glue,\" said Dee Dee. \"I stopped when I was eight [years old].\"<ref name=\"Rombes 86\">Rombes 2005, p. 86.</ref> Dee Dee also explained that its concept came from adolescent trauma.<ref name=\"Rombes 86\"/> After several songs by the Ramones whose titles began with \"I Don't Want to&nbsp;...\", Tommy said that \"Now I Want to Sniff Some Glue\" is the first positive piece on the album.<ref name=\"True 60\"/> The song served as an inspiration for one of the first punk [[fanzine]]s, [[Mark Perry (musician)|Mark Perry]]'s ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]''.<ref name=\"True 60\"/><ref>Savage 2002, p. 182.</ref>

'''\"I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement\"''' is also minimalist, and inspired by horror movies. The entire text is composed of three lines, and the composition was based on three [[major chord]]s. With a playing time of 2:35, it is the longest piece on the album.<ref name=\"Rombes 86\"/> (Asked about the [[public toilet|bathroom]] at [[CBGB]], [[Debbie Harry]] remarked: \"I think that song from the Ramones is partially about that: 'I don't wanna go down to the basement ... ' As kids, we never wanted to go down to the basement cos it was so dark and scary. And that toilet was certainly very scary.\")<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Marcel|last=Anders|title=I was criticised for being too sexual. But it was innocent compared to today|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #197|date=June 2014|p=54}}</ref>

'''\"Loudmouth\"''' has six major chords and is harmonically complex. The song's lyrics are — depending on the reading and punctuation — a single row or four very brief lines.<ref>Rombes 2005, p. 87.</ref>

'''\"Havana Affair\"''' has a lyrical concept incorporating the comic strip ''[[Spy vs. Spy]]'' by Cuban-born illustrator [[Antonio Prohias]].<ref name=\"Rombes 88\">Rombes 2005, p. 88.</ref><ref>Dowel; Halperin; Mangus 2006, p. 55.</ref> At roughly 170 beats per minute, \"Loudmouth\" and \"Havana Affair\" proceed at about the same tempo.<ref name=\"Rombes 88\"/>

\"Havana Affair\" segues into '''\"Listen to My Heart\"''' – the first of many Ramones songs to voice an ironic and pessimistic perspective on a failing or failed relationship.<ref name=\"Rombes 88\"/>

The song \"53rd and 3rd\" is based on the street's reputation for male prostitution.]]

Written solely by Dee Dee, the lyrics of '''\"[[53rd & 3rd|53rd and 3rd]]\"''' concern a male prostitute (\"rent boy\"), waiting at the corner of [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Street]] and [[Third Avenue]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. When the prostitute gets a customer, he kills the customer with a razor to prove he is not a homosexual.<ref>McNeil & McCain 2009, p. 215.</ref> In interviews, Dee Dee described the piece as autobiographical. \"The song speaks for itself,\" Dee Dee commented in an interview. \"Everything I write is autobiographical and written in a very real way, I can't even write.\"<ref>Porter 2004, p. 50.</ref> Johnny insisted that the song is about \"Dee Dee turning tricks.\"<ref name=\"Leigh 132\">Leigh 2009, p. 134.</ref> The half-sung and half-shouted bridge in \"53rd and 3rd\" are performed by Dee Dee, whose voice is described by author Cyrus Patell as what \"breaks the deliberate aural monotony of the song and emphasizes the violence of the lyric.\"<ref>Patell 2011, pp. 132–133.</ref>

'''\"[[Let's Dance (Chris Montez song)|Let's Dance]]\"''' is a [[cover version]] of the hit song by [[Chris Montez]]<ref name=\"Leigh 135\"/>, featuring Leon playing Radio City's large [[Wurlitzer]] [[pipe organ]].<ref name=\"icon 543\"/>

'''\"I Don't Want to Walk Around with You\"''' consists of two lyric lines and three major chords. One of the group's earliest compositions, written at the beginning of 1974, it was the opener on their first [[demo (music)|demo]].<ref name=\"icon 539\"/><ref>True 2005, p. 23.</ref>

\"I Don't Wanna Walk Around with You\" [[Segue#In_music|segues]] into the closing track '''\"Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World\"''', which refers to a [[Hitler Youth]] member.<ref name=\"Leigh 131\">Leigh 2009, p. 131.</ref><ref name=\"Leigh 132\"/> [[Seymour Stein]] complained about its original lyrics — \"I'm a Nazi, baby, I'm a Nazi, yes I am. I'm a Nazi Schatze, y'know I fight for the Fatherland\" — insisting the track was offensive. When he threatened to remove the track from the album, the band put together alternate lyrics: \"I'm a shock trooper in a stupor, yes I am. I'm a Nazi Schatze, y'know I fight for the Fatherland.\" Stein accepted the revision and it was duly released.<ref name=\"Leigh 132\"/><ref>Leigh 2009, p. 133.</ref>

''Ramones'' was released on April 23, 1976, by Sire Records and received glowing reviews. In May, [[John Rockwell]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' published a rave review, saying: \"What the Ramones do is deliver a nonstop set of short, brisk, monochromatically intense songs. ... conventional considerations of pace and variety are thrown calculatedly to the winds. The ingredients are simplicity itself.\" Rockwell noted: \"the effect in the end amounts to an abstraction of rock so pure that other associations get left behind.\"<ref>{{citation |first=John |last=Rockwell |title= Ramones Sire SASD 7520 |date=21 May 1976 |page=82}}</ref> [[Nick Kent]] favourably commented in the ''[[NME]]'': \"This record poses a direct threat to any vaguely sensitive woofer and/or tweeter lodged in your hi-fi ...\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Kent |title=Ramones - ''Ramones'' (Sire records import) |work=NME |date=15 May 1976}}</ref> Reviewing that same month in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', [[Robert Christgau]] said that, while the power of the band's music draws from \"fairly ominous sources\" like Nazi imagery and brutality, he cannot deny the \"sheer pleasure\" of the music: \"For me, it blows everything else off the radio: it's clean the way [[New York Dolls|the Dolls]] never were, sprightly the way [[the Velvet Underground|the Velvets]] never were, and just plain listenable the way [[Black Sabbath (band)|Black Sabbath]] never was.\"<ref name=\"christgau\">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=1976-05-14|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv6-76.php|title=Christgau's Consumer Guide|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|accessdate=2013-05-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325152117/http://robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv6-76.php|archivedate=2014-03-25|url-status=live}}</ref> In July, [[Paul Nelson (critic)|Paul Nelson]] of ''Rolling Stone'' wrote in 1976 that the album was similar to early [[rock and roll]], and was constructed using rhythm tracks of great intensity.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">[[Paul Nelson (critic)|Nelson, Paul]] (1976-07-29).

Later reviews of ''Ramones'' tended to praise the album's influence on rock music.

Regardless of this critical acclaim, ''Ramones'' was not successful commercially. It only reached No. 111 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],<ref name=\"charts\">[http://www.allmusic.com/album/ramones-mw0000691207/awards \"Ramones {{!}} Awards {{!}} AllMusic\"].

==Legacy and influence==
''Ramones'' is considered to have established the musical genre of [[punk rock]], as well as popularizing it years afterward. Rombes wrote that it offered \"alienated future rock\", and that it \"disconnected from tradition.\"<ref name=\"Rombes 2005 p. 40\">Rombes 2005, p. 40.</ref> The album was the start of the Ramones' influence on [[popular music]], with examples being genres such as [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]],<ref>Hoye 2003, p. 124.</ref> [[thrash metal]],<ref>{{cite web| author =Young, Charles M.| title =Johnny's Last Stand| work =Rolling Stone| date =2004-09-16| url =https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theramones/articles/story/6485108/johnnys_last_stand| accessdate =2009-11-05| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100707102258/http://punkrock.tribe.net/thread/fb000a6c-0d9b-4784-ad88-1bece7fa976e| archivedate =2010-07-07| url-status =dead}}</ref> [[indie pop]],<ref>{{cite web| author =Keene, Jarret| title =Candy Man| work =Tucson Weekly| date =2007-11-29| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131226104234/http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/candy-man/Content?oid=1089751| archivedate =2013-12-26| url =http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/candy-man/Content?oid=1089751| accessdate =2009-11-05| url-status =dead}}</ref> [[grunge]],<ref>Hurwitz 2006, p. 16.</ref> [[post-punk]],<ref>Roach 2003, pp. 60–63.</ref> and most notably, punk rock.<ref name=\"gd\">Doeden 2006, p. 10.</ref> The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] said of their influence on rock in general:

{{Quote|When the [Ramones] hit the street in 1976 with their self-titled first album, the rock scene, in general, had become somewhat bloated and narcissistic. The Ramones got back to basics: simple, speedy, stripped-down rock and roll songs. Voice, guitar, bass, drums. No makeup, no egos, no light shows, no nonsense. And though the subject matter was sometimes dark, emanating from a sullen adolescent basement of the mind, the group also brought cartoonish fun and high-energy excitement back to rock and roll.<ref name=\"HallofFame\">{{cite web | url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/ramones | date=2004-09-15 | title=Ramones | publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] | accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref>}}

Despite the lack of popularity in its era, the importance of the album for the development of punk rock music was incredible, influencing many of the most well-known names in punk rock, including [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[the Clash]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]], and [[Green Day]]. [[Billie Joe Armstrong]], singer for Green Day, explained his reasoning for listening to the band: \"they had songs that just stuck in your head, just like a hammer they banged right into your brain.\"<ref name=\"gd\"/> The album also had a great impact on the English punk scene as well, with the bassist for [[Generation X (band)|Generation X]], [[Tony James (musician)|Tony James]], saying that the album caused English bands to change their style. \"When their album came out,\" commented James, \"all the English groups tripled speed overnight. Two-minute-long songs, very fast.\"<ref>Doane 2012, p. 22.</ref> In another interview, James stated that \"Everybody went up three gears the day they got that first Ramones album. Punk rock—that rama-lama super fast stuff—is totally down to the Ramones. Bands were just playing in an [[MC5]] groove until then.\"<ref name=\"strongman 111\">Strongman 2008, p. 111.</ref> In 1999, ''Classic Albums'' by [[List of Collins GEM books|Collins GEM]] recognized ''Ramones'' as the start of English punk rock and called it the fastest and hardest music that could possibly be concocted, stating: \"The songs within were a short, sharp exercise in vicious speed-thrash, driven by ferocious guitars and yet halting in an instant. It was the simple pop dream taken to its minimalist extreme.\"<ref name=\"many reviews\"/> In 2012 the album was preserved by the [[National Recording Registry]], deeming it \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Registry Choices 2012: The National Recording Preservation Board (Library of Congress)|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2012reg.html|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref>

'''Bordeaux''' ({{IPA-fr|bɔʁdo|-|Fr.Bordeaux.ogg}}; [[Gascon language|Gascon]] {{lang-oc|Bordèu}} {{IPA-oc|buɾˈðɛw|}}) is a port city on the [[Garonne]] in the [[Gironde]] [[Departments of France|department]] in Southwestern [[France]].

The municipality ([[Communes of France|commune]]) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of the [[Bordeaux Métropole]] that has a population of 783,081 (2017) and includes its [[suburb]]s and close [[satellite town]]s. With 1,195,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth-largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, and Lille. It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.

Being at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, [[Vinexpo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706075152/http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique/ |archivedate=6 July 2009}}</ref> and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5&nbsp;billion euros each year. [[Bordeaux wine]] has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/6249110.stm |title=In pictures: New World Heritage sites |work=BBC News |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref> After Paris, Bordeaux has the highest number of preserved historical buildings of any city in France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action|title=Commanderie|website=commanderie.org|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref>

{{See also|Timeline of Bordeaux}}
[[File:Bituriges Vivisci.jpg|thumb|left|Coins of the [[Bituriges Vivisci]], 5th–1st century BC, derived from the coin designs of [[Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul]]. [[Cabinet des Médailles]].]]

Around 300 BC the region was the settlement of a [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribe]], the [[Bituriges Vivisci]], named the town '''Burdigala''', probably of [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] origin.

In 107 BC the [[Battle of Burdigala]] was fought by the Romans who were defending the [[Allobroges]], a [[Gauls|Gallic tribe]] allied to Rome, and the [[Tigurini]] led by [[Divico]]. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle. <ref> {{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |author=Sivan, H., R. Mathisen |accessdate=March 29, 2020 11:18 pm |publisher=Pleiades}} </ref>

The city came under [[ancient Rome|Roman]] rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for [[tin]] and [[lead]]. <ref>https://www.romanports.org/en/the-ports/116-burdigala.html  | title=Burdigala(France)  |accessdate=March 29, 2020 11:39 pm </ref> It continued to flourish, especially during the [[Severan dynasty]] (3rd century), and acquired the status of capital of [[Gallia Aquitania|Roman Aquitaine]]. In 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.

[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-Étienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]
In the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.

In 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.

In 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).

During the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760–768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).

In 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed. 

Although the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English. <ref> https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux </ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between. <ref>https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>
==== 12th century to the 20th century  ====
From the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|Eléonore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. André]] was built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cathédrale St-André was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. <ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref>. It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362–1372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory. 

In 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only regained its importance during the 16th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], along with its traditional wine exports.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>

Bordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.

The 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux.<ref> https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action </ref> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Baron Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.

Towards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.

In 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref> This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands. However, on the last of these occasions the French capital was soon moved again to [[Vichy]]. In May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.

From 1940 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.

== Geography ==
Bordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.

=== Climate ===
Bordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.

Winters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971–2000</ref>

== Economy ==
Bordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.

{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is €32.7 Billion.

=== Wine ===
{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}

The wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>

Bordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (châteaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from Médoc and one, Château Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:

Both red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carménère]].

White Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[Sémillon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Château d'Yquem]].

Because of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.

The [[Cité du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cité du vin cernée par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>

=== Others ===
The [[Laser Mégajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.

Some 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].

Tourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelink.co.uk/articles/country-information/france/3-best-places-to-retire-in-france.html|title=3 Best Places to Retire in France|publisher=Globelink.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>

Access to the [[Port de la Lune|port]] from the Atlantic is via the [[Gironde estuary]]. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.

== Population ==
At the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. Bordeaux in its hey day had a population of 262,662 in 1968.<ref name=\"commune_pop2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&ref_id=nattef01214|title=Taille des communes les plus peuplées en 2012 |publisher=INSEE |accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref> The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of [[Italian people|Italians]], [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Germans]]. https://www.citypopulation.de/php/france-gironde.php?cityid=33063.

The built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to [[urban sprawl]], so that by the January 2011 census there were 1,140,668 people living in the overall [[Metropolitan Area (France)|metropolitan area]] of Bordeaux,<ref name=\"AU10_pop\"/> only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.

== Politics ==
At the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to [[Ségolène Royal]] of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], president of the UMP. Then came [[François Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then Ségolène Royal with 25.87%, followed by François Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave Ségolène Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for Ségolène Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round. This is an earthquake in Bordeaux, a city deeply rooted right traditions{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

In the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragué]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragué]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Juppé]] confronted the General Counsel PS Michèle Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Juppé was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Michèle Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Michèle Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Juppé, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, Noël Mamère was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, Noël Mamère was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.

In 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Juppé and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of Ségolène Royal and [[Michèle Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Juppé who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.

In the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology José Bové came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:

UMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front Gérard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.

=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===
Europe's longest-span [[vertical-lift bridge]], the [[Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is {{convert|117|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and can be lifted vertically up to {{convert|53|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to let tall ships pass underneath. The €160 million bridge was inaugurated by President [[François Hollande]] and Mayor Alain Juppé on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.

=== Shopping ===
Bordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and cafés; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Comédie'' by the ''Grand Théâtre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Comédie'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.

== Culture ==

[[File:RB 20200222 Bordeaux-11.jpg|thumb|Maison de l’Économie Créative et de la Culture en Aquitaine]]
Bordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, ''[[Arc en rêve]]''.{{citation needed |date=January 2018}} Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the [[Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux|Opéra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.

== Transport ==
=== Road ===
Bordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.

Bordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont François Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009–2012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.
Another bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc – La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>

Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.

=== Rail ===
The main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express régional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[Périgueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le Médoc, Angoulême and [[Bayonne]].

Historically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.

The two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.

Since July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.

=== Air ===
Bordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[Mérignac, Gironde|Mérignac]].

[[File:Aéroport Bx Mérignac.JPG|thumb|[[Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport]]]]

=== Trams, buses and boats ===
[[File:Bordeaux-lawn-track-&-vines1.jpg|thumb|Tramway in Bordeaux]]
Bordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux Métropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:
* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])
* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)
* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)
* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre
* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river
This network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.

There had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.

The planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le tracé du tramway qui va desservir l'aéroport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>

=== Taxis ===
There are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.

===Public transportation statistics===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is {{convert|7|km|abbr=on}}, while 8% travel for over {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_France_Bordeaux-924|title=Bordeaux Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|accessdate=June 19, 2017}} [[File:CC-BY_icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].</ref>

== Sport ==
[[File:Bordeaux Stade Lescure entrée.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the Stade Chaban-Delmas]]{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}

The 41,458-capacity [[Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux]] is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].

There are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux Bègles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].
Skateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.

Bordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.

There is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], Vélodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.

The 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.

Between 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>

'''Bordeaux''' ({{IPA-fr|bɔʁdo|-|Fr.Bordeaux.ogg}}; [[Gascon language|Gascon]] {{lang-oc|Bordèu}} {{IPA-oc|buɾˈðɛw|}}) is a port city on the [[Garonne]] in the [[Gironde]] [[Departments of France|department]] in Southwestern [[France]].

The municipality ([[Communes of France|commune]]) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of the [[Bordeaux Métropole]] that has a population of 783,081 (2017) and includes its [[suburb]]s and close [[satellite town]]s. With 1,195,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth-largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, and Lille. It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.

Being at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, [[Vinexpo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706075152/http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique/ |archivedate=6 July 2009}}</ref> and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5&nbsp;billion euros each year. [[Bordeaux wine]] has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\" of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/6249110.stm |title=In pictures: New World Heritage sites |work=BBC News |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref> After Paris, Bordeaux has the highest number of preserved historical buildings of any city in France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action|title=Commanderie|website=commanderie.org|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref>
== History == 
==== 5th Century Bc to the 11th Century  ====
{{See also|Timeline of Bordeaux}}
[[File:Bituriges Vivisci.jpg|thumb|left|Coins of the [[Bituriges Vivisci]], 5th–1st century BC, derived from the coin designs of [[Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul]]. [[Cabinet des Médailles]].]]

Around 300 BC the region was the settlement of a [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribe]], the [[Bituriges Vivisci]], named the town '''Burdigala''', probably of [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] origin.

In 107 BC the [[Battle of Burdigala]] was fought by the Romans who were defending the [[Allobroges]], a [[Gauls|Gallic tribe]] allied to Rome, and the [[Tigurini]] led by [[Divico]]. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle. <ref> {{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |author=Sivan, H., R. Mathisen |accessdate=March 29, 2020 11:18 pm |publisher=Pleiades}} </ref>

The city came under [[ancient Rome|Roman]] rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for [[tin]] and [[lead]]. <ref>https://www.romanports.org/en/the-ports/116-burdigala.html  | title=Burdigala(France)  |accessdate=March 29, 2020 11:39 pm </ref> It continued to flourish, especially during the [[Severan dynasty]] (3rd century), and acquired the status of capital of [[Gallia Aquitania|Roman Aquitaine]]. In 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.

[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-Étienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]
In the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.

In 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.

In 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).

During the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760–768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).

In 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed. 

Although the port of Bordeaux was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and Norman invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry Plantagenet in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English. <ref> https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux </ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between. <ref>https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>
==== 12th century to the 20th century  ====
From the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|Eléonore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. André]] was built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cathédrale St-André was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. <ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref>. It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362–1372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory. 

In 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only regained its importance during the 16th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], along with its traditional wine exports.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>

Bordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.
[[File:Edouard Manet 026.jpg|thumb|[[Édouard Manet]]: ''Harbour at Bordeaux'', 1871]]
[[File:Bordeaux rue Sainte-Catherine avril 1905.jpg|thumb|right|Rue Sainte-Catherine in 1905]]

The 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux.<ref> https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action </ref> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Baron Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.

Towards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.

In 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref> This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands. However, on the last of these occasions the French capital was soon moved again to [[Vichy]]. In May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.

From 1940 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.

== Geography ==
Bordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.

=== Climate ===
Bordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.

Winters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971–2000</ref>

== Economy ==
Bordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.

{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is €32.7 Billion.

=== Wine ===
{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}

The wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>

Bordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (châteaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from Médoc and one, Château Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:

Both red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carménère]].

White Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[Sémillon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Château d'Yquem]].

Because of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.

The [[Cité du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cité du vin cernée par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>

=== Others ===
The [[Laser Mégajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.

Some 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].

Tourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelink.co.uk/articles/country-information/france/3-best-places-to-retire-in-france.html|title=3 Best Places to Retire in France|publisher=Globelink.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>

Access to the port from the Atlantic is via the [[Gironde estuary]]. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.

At the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. Bordeaux in its hey day had a population of 262,662 in 1968.<ref name=\"commune_pop2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&ref_id=nattef01214|title=Taille des communes les plus peuplées en 2012 |publisher=INSEE |accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref> The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of [[Italian people|Italians]], [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Germans]]. https://www.citypopulation.de/php/france-gironde.php?cityid=33063.

The built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to [[urban sprawl]], so that by the January 2011 census there were 1,140,668 people living in the overall [[Metropolitan Area (France)|metropolitan area]] of Bordeaux,<ref name=\"AU10_pop\"/> only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.

== Politics ==
At the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to [[Ségolène Royal]] of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], president of the UMP. Then came [[François Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then Ségolène Royal with 25.87%, followed by François Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave Ségolène Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for Ségolène Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round. This is an earthquake in Bordeaux, a city deeply rooted right traditions{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

In the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragué]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragué]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Juppé]] confronted the General Counsel PS Michèle Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Juppé was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Michèle Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Michèle Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Juppé, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, Noël Mamère was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, Noël Mamère was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.

In 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Juppé and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of Ségolène Royal and [[Michèle Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Juppé who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.

In the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology José Bové came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:

UMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front Gérard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.

=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===
Europe's longest-span [[vertical-lift bridge]], the [[Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is {{convert|117|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and can be lifted vertically up to {{convert|53|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to let tall ships pass underneath. The €160 million bridge was inaugurated by President [[François Hollande]] and Mayor Alain Juppé on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.

=== Shopping ===
Bordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and cafés; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Comédie'' by the ''Grand Théâtre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Comédie'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.

Bordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, ''[[Arc en rêve]]''.{{citation needed |date=January 2018}} Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the [[Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux|Opéra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.

== Transport ==
=== Road ===
Bordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.

Bordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont François Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009–2012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.
Another bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc – La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>

Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.

=== Rail ===
The main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express régional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[Périgueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le Médoc, Angoulême and [[Bayonne]].

Historically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.

The two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.

Since July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.

=== Air ===
Bordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[Mérignac, Gironde|Mérignac]].

Bordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux Métropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:
* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])
* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)
* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)
* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre
* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river
This network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.

There had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.

The planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le tracé du tramway qui va desservir l'aéroport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>

== Sport ==
[[File:Bordeaux Stade Lescure entrée.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the Stade Chaban-Delmas]]{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}

The 41,458-capacity [[Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux]] is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].

There are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux Bègles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].
Skateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.

Bordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.

There is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], Vélodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.

The 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.

Between 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:PHIL 2214.tif|thumb|upright=1.3|Rose spots on chest of a person with typhoid fever]]
Classically, the progression of untreated typhoid fever is divided into four distinct stages, each lasting about a week. Over the course of these stages, the patient becomes exhausted and emaciated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Typhoid|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/typhoid|publisher=Merriam Webster Dictionary|access-date=2013-06-24|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702140640/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/typhoid|archive-date=2013-07-02}}</ref>
* In the first week, the body temperature rises slowly, and fever fluctuations are seen with relative [[bradycardia]] ([[Faget sign]]), [[malaise]], headache, and cough. A bloody nose ([[epistaxis]]) is seen in a quarter of cases, and abdominal pain is also possible. A decrease in the number of circulating white blood cells ([[leukopenia]]) occurs with [[eosinopenia]] and relative [[lymphocytosis]]; blood cultures are positive for ''Salmonella enterica'' subsp. enterica serovar Typhi. The [[Widal test]] is usually negative in the first week.<ref name=\"pmid27796818\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar P, Kumar R | title = Enteric Fever | journal = Indian Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 84 | issue = 3 | pages = 227–230 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 27796818 | doi = 10.1007/s12098-016-2246-4 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b89df212dd3539eb6fd70910c7c60dcf1704a333 }}</ref>
* In the second week, the person is often too tired to get up, with high fever in plateau around {{convert|40|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and bradycardia (sphygmothermic dissociation or Faget sign), classically with a [[dicrotic pulse]] wave. [[Delirium]] can occur, where the patient is often calm, but sometimes becomes agitated. This delirium has led to typhoid receiving the nickname \"nervous fever\". [[Rose spots]] appear on the lower chest and abdomen in around a third of patients. [[Rhonchi]] (rattling breathing sounds) are heard in the base of the lungs. The abdomen is distended and painful in the right lower quadrant, where a rumbling sound can be heard. Diarrhea can occur in this stage, but constipation is also common. The spleen and liver are enlarged ([[hepatosplenomegaly]]) and tender, and liver [[transaminases]] are elevated. The Widal test is strongly positive, with antiO and antiH antibodies. Blood cultures are sometimes still positive at this stage. The major symptom of this fever is that it usually rises in the afternoon up to the first and second week.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}
* In the third week of typhoid fever, a number of complications can occur:
** [[Gastrointestinal bleeding|Intestinal haemorrhage]] due to bleeding in congested [[Peyer's patches]] occurs; this can be very serious, but is usually not fatal.
** Intestinal perforation in the distal [[ileum]] is a very serious complication and is frequently fatal. It may occur without alarming symptoms until [[septicaemia]] or diffuse [[peritonitis]] sets in.
** [[Encephalitis]]
** Respiratory diseases such as [[pneumonia]] and [[acute bronchitis]]
** Neuropsychiatric symptoms (described as \"muttering delirium\" or \"coma vigil\"), with picking at bedclothes or imaginary objects
** Metastatic abscesses, [[cholecystitis]], [[endocarditis]], and [[osteitis]]
** The fever is still very high and oscillates very little over 24 hours. [[Dehydration]] ensues, and the patient is delirious (typhoid state). One-third of affected individuals develop a macular rash on the trunk.
** Platelet count goes down slowly and the risk of bleeding rises.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}
* By the end of third week, the fever starts subsiding.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

=== Transmission ===
Unlike other strains of ''[[Salmonella]]'', no animal carriers of typhoid are known.<ref name=Eng2015 /> Humans are the only known carriers of the bacteria.<ref name=Eng2015 /> ''S. enterica'' subsp. enterica serovar Typhi is spread through the [[fecal-oral route]] from individuals who are currently infected and from [[asymptomatic carriers]] of the bacteria.<ref name=Eng2015>{{cite journal| vauthors = Eng SK, Pusparajah P, Ab Mutalib NS, Ser HL, Chan KG, Lee LH |title=Salmonella:A review on pathogenesis, epidemiology and antibiotic resistance|journal=Frontiers in Life Science|date= June 2015|volume=8|issue=3|pages=284–293|doi=10.1080/21553769.2015.1051243}}</ref> An asymptomatic human carrier is an individual who is still excreting typhoid bacteria in their stool a year after the acute stage of the infection.<ref name=Eng2015 />

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is made by any [[blood culture|blood]], [[bone marrow]], or [[Human feces|stool]] [[culture]]s and with the Widal test (demonstration of [[antibody|antibodies]] against ''Salmonella'' [[antigens]] [[O-somatic]] and [[H-flagellar]]). In epidemics and less wealthy countries, after excluding [[malaria]], [[dysentery]], or [[pneumonia]], a therapeutic trial time with [[chloramphenicol]] is generally undertaken while awaiting the results of the Widal test and cultures of the blood and stool.<ref name=\"Sherris\">{{cite book | veditors = Ryan KJ, Ray CG |title=Sherris Medical Microbiology |edition=4th |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8385-8529-0}}</ref>

=== Widal test ===
[[File:Widal Test Slide.jpg|thumb|widal test card]]
Widal test is used to identify specific antibodies in serum of people with typhoid by using antigen-antibody interactions.

In this test, the serum is mixed with a dead bacterial suspension of salmonella having specific antigens on it. If the patient's serum is carrying antibodies against those antigens then they get attached to them forming clumping which indicated the positivity of the test. If clumping does not occur then the test is negative. The [[Widal test]] is time-consuming and prone to significant false positive results. The test may also be falsely negative in the early course of illness. However, unlike the Typhidot test, the Widal test quantifies the specimen with [[titer|titres]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/widal-test|title=Widal Test - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>

=== Typhidot ===
The test is based on the presence of specific IgM and IgG antibodies to a specific 50[[Dissociation constant|Kd]] OMP antigen. This test is carried out on a cellulose nitrate membrane where a specific ''S. typhi'' outer membrane protein is attached as fixed test lines. It separately identifies IgM and IgG antibodies. IgM shows recent infection whereas IgG signifies remote infection.

The sample pad of this kit contains colloidal gold-anti-human IgG or gold-anti-human IgM. If the sample contains IgG and IgM antibodies against those antigens then they will react and get turned into red color. This complex will continue to move forward and the IgG and IgM antibodies will get attached to the first test line where IgG and IgM antigens are present giving a pink-purplish colored band. This complex will continue to move further and reach the control line which consists of rabbit anti-mouse antibody which bends the mouse anti-human IgG or IgM antibodies. The main purpose of the control line is to indicate a proper migration and reagent color. The typhidot test becomes positive within 2–3 days of infection.

Two colored bands indicate a positive test. Single-band of control line indicates a negative test. Single-band of first fixed line or no bands at all indicates invalid tests. The most important limitation of this test is that it is not quantitative and the result is only positive or negative.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=Pak-Leong|last2=Tam|first2=Frankie C.

Tubex test contains two types of particles brown magnetic particles coated with antigen and blue indicator particles coated with O9 antibody. During the test, if antibodies are present in the serum then they will get attached to the brown magnetic particles and settle down at the base and the blue indicator particles remain up in the solution giving a blue color that indicates positivity of the test.

If the serum does not have an antibody in it then the blue particle gets attached to the brown particles and settled down at the bottom giving no color to the solution which means the test is negative and they do not have typhoid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reszonics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Reszon-IFU-TYPHIDOT-Rapid-IgG_IgM-combo-2014-04.pdf|title=TYPHIDOT Rapid IgG/IgM (Combo)|last=|first=|date=|website=Reszon Diagnostics International|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=14 November 2019}}</ref>

Sanitation and hygiene are important to prevent typhoid. It can only spread in environments where human feces are able to come into contact with food or drinking water. Careful food preparation and washing of hands are crucial to prevent typhoid. Industrialization, and in particular, the invention of the automobile, contributed greatly to the elimination of typhoid fever, as it eliminated the public-health hazards associated with having horse manure in public streets, which led to large number of flies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/Great-Horse-Manure-Crisis-of-1894/|title=The Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525202107/http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/Great-Horse-Manure-Crisis-of-1894/|archive-date=2015-05-25}}</ref> which are known as [[vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of many pathogens, including ''Salmonella'' spp.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cirillo VJ | title = \"Winged sponges\": houseflies as carriers of typhoid fever in 19th- and early 20th-century military camps | journal = Perspectives in Biology and Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 52–63 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16489276 | doi = 10.1353/pbm.2006.0005 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/012aed0d48042de9f9c66e7b69ba66dcdac8bc14 }}</ref> According to statistics from the United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] of drinking water has led to dramatic decreases in the transmission of typhoid fever in the United States. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Vaccination===
Two [[typhoid vaccine]]s are licensed for use for the prevention of typhoid:<ref name=Mil2018/> the live, oral [[Ty21a]] vaccine (sold as Vivotif by Crucell Switzerland AG) and the injectable [[typhoid polysaccharide vaccine]] (sold as Typhim Vi by Sanofi Pasteur and Typherix by GlaxoSmithKline). Both are efficacious and recommended for travellers to areas where typhoid is endemic. Boosters are recommended every five years for the oral vaccine and every two years for the injectable form.<ref name=\"Mil2018\"/> An older, killed whole-cell vaccine is still used in countries where the newer preparations are not available, but this vaccine is no longer recommended for use because it has a higher rate of side effects (mainly pain and inflammation at the site of the injection).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marathe SA, Lahiri A, Negi VD, Chakravortty D | title = Typhoid fever & vaccine development: a partially answered question | journal = The Indian Journal of Medical Research | volume = 135 | issue = 2 | pages = 161–9 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22446857 | pmc = 3336846 }}</ref>

To help decrease rates of typhoid fever in developing nations, the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed the use of a vaccination program starting in 1999. Vaccinations have proven to be a great way at controlling outbreaks in high incidence areas. Just as important, it is also very cost-effective. Vaccination prices are normally low, less than US$1 per dose. Because the price is low, poverty-stricken communities are more willing to take advantage of the vaccinations.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Date KA, Bentsi-Enchill A, Marks F, Fox K | title = Typhoid fever vaccination strategies | journal = Vaccine | volume = 33 Suppl 3 | pages = C55-61 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25902360 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.028 }}</ref> Although vaccination programs for typhoid have proven to be effective, they alone cannot eliminate typhoid fever.<ref name=\":0\" /> Combining the use of vaccines with increasing public health efforts is the only proven way to control this disease.<ref name=\":0\" />

Since the 1990s, two typhoid fever vaccines have been recommended by the WHO. The ViPS vaccine is given via injection, while the Ty21a is taken through capsules. Only people 2 years or older are recommended to be vaccinated with the ViPS vaccine, and it requires a revaccination after 2–3 years with a 55–72% vaccine efficacy. The alternative Ty21a vaccine is recommended for people 5 years or older, and has a 5-7-year duration with a 51–67% vaccine efficacy. The two different vaccines have been proven as a safe and effective treatment for epidemic disease control in multiple regions.<ref name=\":0\"/>

Typhoid fever, when properly treated, is not fatal in most cases. Antibiotics, such as [[ampicillin]], chloramphenicol, [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]], [[amoxicillin]], and ciprofloxacin, have been commonly used to treat typhoid fever.<ref>Baron S et al.</ref> Treatment of the disease with antibiotics reduces the case-fatality rate to about 1%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index7.html |title=Diarrhoeal Diseases (Updated February 2009) |access-date=2013-04-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102190825/http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index7.html |archive-date=November 2, 2011 }}.

Without treatment, some patients develop sustained fever, bradycardia, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal symptoms, and occasionally, pneumonia. In white-skinned patients, pink spots, which fade on pressure, appear on the skin of the trunk in up to 20% of cases. In the third week, untreated cases may develop gastrointestinal and cerebral complications, which may prove fatal in up to 10–20% of cases. The highest case fatality rates are reported in children under 4 years. Around 2–5% of those who contract typhoid fever become chronic carriers, as bacteria persist in the biliary tract after symptoms have resolved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/ith/diseases/typhoidfever/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Typhoid fever|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-08-10|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727173454/http://www.who.int/ith/diseases/typhoidfever/en/|archive-date=2017-07-27}}</ref>

=== Surgery ===
Surgery is usually indicated if [[intestinal perforation]] occurs. One study found a 30-day mortality rate of 9% (8/88), and surgical site infections at 67% (59/88), with the disease burden borne predominantly by low-resource countries.<ref name=GlobalSurg2>{{cite journal | title = Management and Outcomes Following Surgery for Gastrointestinal Typhoid: An International, Prospective, Multicentre Cohort Study | journal = World Journal of Surgery | volume = 42 | issue = 10 | pages = 3179–3188 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 29725797 | pmc = 6132852 | doi = 10.1007/s00268-018-4624-8 | author1 = GlobalSurg Collaborative }}</ref>

For surgical treatment, most surgeons prefer simple closure of the perforation with drainage of the [[peritoneum]]. Small-bowel resection is indicated for patients with multiple perforations. If antibiotic treatment fails to eradicate the [[hepatobiliary]] carriage, the [[gallbladder]] should be resected. [[Cholecystectomy]] is not always successful in eradicating the carrier state because of persisting hepatic infection.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

=== Resistance ===
As resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and [[streptomycin]] is now common, these agents have not been used as first–line treatment of typhoid fever for almost 20 years.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Typhoid resistant to these agents is known as multidrug-resistant typhoid.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Ciprofloxacin resistance is an increasing problem, especially in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Many centres are shifting from using ciprofloxacin as the first line for treating suspected typhoid originating in South America, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Thailand, or Vietnam. For these people, the recommended first-line treatment is [[ceftriaxone]]. Also, [[azithromycin]] has been suggested to be better at treating resistant typhoid in  populations than both fluoroquinolone drugs and ceftriaxone.<ref name=\"pmid21975746\" /> Azithromycin can be taken by mouth and is less expensive than ceftriaxone which is given by injection.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gibani |first1=MM |last2=Britto |first2=C |last3=Pollard |first3=AJ |title=Typhoid and paratyphoid fever: a call to action. |journal=Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases |date=October 2018 |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=440–448 |doi=10.1097/QCO.0000000000000479 |pmid=30138141|pmc=6319573 }}</ref>

A separate problem exists with laboratory testing for reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin; current recommendations are that isolates should be tested simultaneously against ciprofloxacin (CIP) and against [[nalidixic acid]] (NAL), and that isolates that are sensitive to both CIP and NAL should be reported as \"sensitive to ciprofloxacin\", but that isolates testing sensitive to CIP but not to NAL should be reported as \"reduced sensitivity to ciprofloxacin\". However, an analysis of 271 isolates showed that around 18% of isolates with a reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ([[Minimum inhibitory concentration|MIC]] 0.125–1.0&nbsp;mg/l) would not be picked up by this method.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cooke FJ, Wain J, Threlfall EJ | title = Fluoroquinolone resistance in Salmonella Typhi | journal = BMJ | volume = 333 | issue = 7563 | pages = 353–4 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16902221 | pmc = 1539082 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.333.7563.353-b }}</ref> How this problem can be solved is not certain, because most laboratories around the world (including the West) are dependent on [[Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing|disk testing]] and cannot test for MICs.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

The most notorious carrier of typhoid fever, but by no means the most destructive, was [[Mary Mallon]], also known as Typhoid Mary. In 1907, she became the first carrier in the United States to be identified and traced. She was a cook in New York, who was closely associated with 53 cases and three deaths.<ref name=\"Nova\">{{cite web |title=Nova: The Most Dangerous Woman in America |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/typhoid/letter.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426042928/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/typhoid/letter.html |archive-date=2010-04-26 }}</ref>

==History==
===Spread===
During the course of treatment of a typhoid outbreak in a local village in 1838, English country doctor [[William Budd]] realised the \"poisons\" involved in [[infectious disease]]s multiplied in the intestines of the sick, were present in their excretions, and could be transmitted to the healthy through their consumption of contaminated water.<ref>Asimov, ''[[Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology]]'' 2nd Revised edition</ref> He proposed strict isolation or quarantine as a method for containing such outbreaks in the future.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Aronson SM | title = William Budd and typhoid fever | journal = Rhode Island Medicine | volume = 78 | issue = 11 | pages = 310 | date = November 1995 | pmid = 8547718 }}</ref> The medical and scientific communities did not identify the role of microorganisms in infectious disease until the work of [[Robert Koch]] and [[Louis Pasteur]].<ref>John Tyndall, \"Introduction\", in René Vallery-Radot, trans.

===Organism involved===
[[File:Almroth Wright c1900.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Almroth Edward Wright]] developed the first effective typhoid vaccine.]]
In 1880, [[Karl Joseph Eberth]] described a bacillus that he suspected was the cause of typhoid.<ref>

Today, the bacillus that causes typhoid fever goes by the scientific name ''[[Salmonella enterica enterica]]'', serovar Typhi.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

=== Vaccine ===
British bacteriologist [[Almroth Edward Wright]] first developed an effective typhoid vaccine at the Army Medical School in [[Netley]], [[Hampshire]]. It was introduced in 1896 and used successfully by the British during the [[Boer War]] in South Africa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/649457/Sir-Almroth-Edward-Wright|title=Sir Almroth Edward Wright |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111031313/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/649457/Sir-Almroth-Edward-Wright |archive-date=2013-11-11 }}</ref> At that time, typhoid often killed more soldiers at war than were lost due to enemy combat. Wright further developed his vaccine at a newly opened research department at [[St Mary's Hospital (London)|St Mary's Hospital]] Medical School in London from 1902, where he established a method for measuring protective substances ([[opsonin]]) in human blood.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Citing the example of the [[Second Boer War]], during which many soldiers died from easily preventable diseases, Wright convinced the [[British Army]] that 10 million vaccine doses should be produced for the troops being sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], thereby saving up to half a million lives during [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=5&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27wright%27%29 |title=Library and Archive Catalogue |publisher=Royal Society |access-date=1 November 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> The British Army was the only combatant at the outbreak of the war to have its troops fully immunized against the bacterium.

In 1909, [[Frederick F. Russell]], a [[U.S. Army]] physician, adopted Wright's typhoid vaccine for use with the Army, and two years later, his vaccination program became the first in which an entire army was immunized. It eliminated typhoid as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. military.<ref name=\"USAMRMC\">{{cite book|title=USAMRMC: 50 Years of Dedication to the Warfighter 1958–2008|url=http://technologytransfer.amedd.army.mil/assets/docs/marketing/USAMRMC_history.pdf|publisher=U.S. Army Medical Research & Material Command (2008)|year=2008|page=5|asin=B003WYKJNY|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214210353/http://technologytransfer.amedd.army.mil/assets/docs/marketing/USAMRMC_history.pdf|archive-date=2013-02-14|access-date=2013-03-27}}</ref>

===Chlorination of water===
[[File:LizzieVanZyl.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Lizzie van Zyl]] was a child inmate in a British-run concentration camp in South Africa who died from typhoid fever during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] (1899–1902).]]
Most developed countries had declining rates of typhoid fever throughout the first half of the 20th century due to vaccinations and advances in public sanitation and hygiene. In 1893 attempts were made to chlorinate the water supply in [[Hamburg]], Germany and in 1897 [[Maidstone]], England was the first town to have its entire water supply chlorinated.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Typhoid Epidemic at Maidstone|date=October 1897|journal=Journal of the Sanitary Institute|volume=18|pages=388}}</ref>  In 1905, following an outbreak of typhoid fever, the City of [[Lincoln, England]] instituted permanent water chlorination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2008/08/25/9150211/chlorine-cleans-water-for-millions-but-comes-under-attack-after-health.html|title=A miracle for public health?|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>  The first permanent disinfection of drinking water in the US was made in 1908 to the [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], water supply. Credit for the decision to build the chlorination system has been given to [[John L. Leal]].<ref>Leal, John L. (1909). \"The Sterilization Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company at Boonton, N.J.\" ''Proceedings American Water Works Association.'' pp. 100–9.</ref> The [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] facility was designed by [[George W. Fuller]].<ref>Fuller, George W. (1909). \"Description of the Process and Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company for the Sterilization of the Water of the Boonton Reservoir.\" ''Proceedings American Water Works Association.'' 110-34.</ref>

===Antibiotics===
In 1942, doctors introduced antibiotics in clinical practice, greatly reducing mortality.

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:PHIL 2214.tif|thumb|upright=1.3|Rose spots on chest of a person with typhoid fever]]
Classically, the progression of untreated typhoid fever is divided into four distinct stages, each lasting about a week. Over the course of these stages, the patient becomes exhausted and emaciated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Typhoid|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/typhoid|publisher=Merriam Webster Dictionary|access-date=2013-06-24|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702140640/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/typhoid|archive-date=2013-07-02}}</ref>
* In the first week, the body temperature rises slowly, and fever fluctuations are seen with relative [[bradycardia]] ([[Faget sign]]), [[malaise]], headache, and cough. A bloody nose ([[epistaxis]]) is seen in a quarter of cases, and abdominal pain is also possible. A decrease in the number of circulating white blood cells ([[leukopenia]]) occurs with [[eosinopenia]] and relative [[lymphocytosis]]; blood cultures are positive for ''Salmonella enterica'' subsp. enterica serovar Typhi. The [[Widal test]] is usually negative in the first week.<ref name=\"pmid27796818\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar P, Kumar R | title = Enteric Fever | journal = Indian Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 84 | issue = 3 | pages = 227–230 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 27796818 | doi = 10.1007/s12098-016-2246-4 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b89df212dd3539eb6fd70910c7c60dcf1704a333 }}</ref>
* In the second week, the person is often too tired to get up, with high fever in plateau around {{convert|40|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and bradycardia (sphygmothermic dissociation or Faget sign), classically with a [[dicrotic pulse]] wave. [[Delirium]] can occur, where the patient is often calm, but sometimes becomes agitated. This delirium has led to typhoid receiving the nickname \"nervous fever\". [[Rose spots]] appear on the lower chest and abdomen in around a third of patients. [[Rhonchi]] (rattling breathing sounds) are heard in the base of the lungs. The abdomen is distended and painful in the right lower quadrant, where a rumbling sound can be heard. Diarrhea can occur in this stage, but constipation is also common. The spleen and liver are enlarged ([[hepatosplenomegaly]]) and tender, and liver [[transaminases]] are elevated. The Widal test is strongly positive, with antiO and antiH antibodies. Blood cultures are sometimes still positive at this stage. The major symptom of this fever is that it usually rises in the afternoon up to the first and second week.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}
* In the third week of typhoid fever, a number of complications can occur:
** [[Gastrointestinal bleeding|Intestinal haemorrhage]] due to bleeding in congested [[Peyer's patches]] occurs; this can be very serious, but is usually not fatal.
** Intestinal perforation in the distal [[ileum]] is a very serious complication and is frequently fatal. It may occur without alarming symptoms until [[septicaemia]] or diffuse [[peritonitis]] sets in.
** [[Encephalitis]]
** Respiratory diseases such as [[pneumonia]] and [[acute bronchitis]]
** Neuropsychiatric symptoms (described as \"muttering delirium\" or \"coma vigil\"), with picking at bedclothes or imaginary objects
** Metastatic abscesses, [[cholecystitis]], [[endocarditis]], and [[osteitis]]
** The fever is still very high and oscillates very little over 24 hours. [[Dehydration]] ensues, and the patient is delirious (typhoid state). One-third of affected individuals develop a macular rash on the trunk.
** Platelet count goes down slowly and the risk of bleeding rises.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}
* By the end of third week, the fever starts subsiding.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is made by any [[blood culture|blood]], [[bone marrow]], or [[Human feces|stool]] [[culture]]s and with the Widal test (demonstration of [[antibody|antibodies]] against ''Salmonella'' [[antigens]] [[O-somatic]] and [[H-flagellar]]). In epidemics and less wealthy countries, after excluding [[malaria]], [[dysentery]], or [[pneumonia]], a therapeutic trial time with [[chloramphenicol]] is generally undertaken while awaiting the results of the Widal test and cultures of the blood and stool.<ref name=\"Sherris\">{{cite book | veditors = Ryan KJ, Ray CG |title=Sherris Medical Microbiology |edition=4th |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8385-8529-0}}</ref>

=== Widal test ===
[[File:Widal Test Slide.jpg|thumb|widal test card]]
Widal test is used to identify specific antibodies in serum of people with typhoid by using antigen-antibody interactions.

In this test, the serum is mixed with a dead bacterial suspension of salmonella having specific antigens on it. If the patient's serum is carrying antibodies against those antigens then they get attached to them forming clumping which indicated the positivity of the test. If clumping does not occur then the test is negative. The [[Widal test]] is time-consuming and prone to significant false positive results. The test may also be falsely negative in the early course of illness. However, unlike the Typhidot test, the Widal test quantifies the specimen with [[titer|titres]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/widal-test|title=Widal Test - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>

=== Typhidot ===
The test is based on the presence of specific IgM and IgG antibodies to a specific 50[[Dissociation constant|Kd]] OMP antigen. This test is carried out on a cellulose nitrate membrane where a specific ''S. typhi'' outer membrane protein is attached as fixed test lines. It separately identifies IgM and IgG antibodies. IgM shows recent infection whereas IgG signifies remote infection.

The sample pad of this kit contains colloidal gold-anti-human IgG or gold-anti-human IgM. If the sample contains IgG and IgM antibodies against those antigens then they will react and get turned into red color. This complex will continue to move forward and the IgG and IgM antibodies will get attached to the first test line where IgG and IgM antigens are present giving a pink-purplish colored band. This complex will continue to move further and reach the control line which consists of rabbit anti-mouse antibody which bends the mouse anti-human IgG or IgM antibodies. The main purpose of the control line is to indicate a proper migration and reagent color. The typhidot test becomes positive within 2–3 days of infection.

Two colored bands indicate a positive test. Single-band of control line indicates a negative test. Single-band of first fixed line or no bands at all indicates invalid tests. The most important limitation of this test is that it is not quantitative and the result is only positive or negative.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=Pak-Leong|last2=Tam|first2=Frankie C.

=== Tubex test ===
Tubex test contains two types of particles brown magnetic particles coated with antigen and blue indicator particles coated with O9 antibody. During the test, if antibodies are present in the serum then they will get attached to the brown magnetic particles and settle down at the base and the blue indicator particles remain up in the solution giving a blue color that indicates positivity of the test.

If the serum does not have an antibody in it then the blue particle gets attached to the brown particles and settled down at the bottom giving no color to the solution which means the test is negative and they do not have typhoid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reszonics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Reszon-IFU-TYPHIDOT-Rapid-IgG_IgM-combo-2014-04.pdf|title=TYPHIDOT Rapid IgG/IgM (Combo)|last=|first=|date=|website=Reszon Diagnostics International|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=14 November 2019}}</ref>

== Prevention ==
[[File:Typhoid inoculation2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Doctor administering a typhoid [[vaccination]] at a school in [[San Augustine County, Texas]], 1943]]

Sanitation and hygiene are important to prevent typhoid. It can only spread in environments where human feces are able to come into contact with food or drinking water. Careful food preparation and washing of hands are crucial to prevent typhoid. Industrialization, and in particular, the invention of the automobile, contributed greatly to the elimination of typhoid fever, as it eliminated the public-health hazards associated with having horse manure in public streets, which led to large number of flies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/Great-Horse-Manure-Crisis-of-1894/|title=The Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525202107/http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/Great-Horse-Manure-Crisis-of-1894/|archive-date=2015-05-25}}</ref> which are known as [[vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of many pathogens, including ''Salmonella'' spp.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cirillo VJ | title = \"Winged sponges\": houseflies as carriers of typhoid fever in 19th- and early 20th-century military camps | journal = Perspectives in Biology and Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 52–63 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16489276 | doi = 10.1353/pbm.2006.0005 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/012aed0d48042de9f9c66e7b69ba66dcdac8bc14 }}</ref> According to statistics from the United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] of drinking water has led to dramatic decreases in the transmission of typhoid fever in the United States. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Vaccination===
Two [[typhoid vaccine]]s are licensed for use for the prevention of typhoid:<ref name=Mil2018/> the live, oral [[Ty21a]] vaccine (sold as Vivotif by Crucell Switzerland AG) and the injectable [[typhoid polysaccharide vaccine]] (sold as Typhim Vi by Sanofi Pasteur and Typherix by GlaxoSmithKline). Both are efficacious and recommended for travellers to areas where typhoid is endemic. Boosters are recommended every five years for the oral vaccine and every two years for the injectable form.<ref name=\"Mil2018\"/> An older, killed whole-cell vaccine is still used in countries where the newer preparations are not available, but this vaccine is no longer recommended for use because it has a higher rate of side effects (mainly pain and inflammation at the site of the injection).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marathe SA, Lahiri A, Negi VD, Chakravortty D | title = Typhoid fever & vaccine development: a partially answered question | journal = The Indian Journal of Medical Research | volume = 135 | issue = 2 | pages = 161–9 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22446857 | pmc = 3336846 }}</ref>

To help decrease rates of typhoid fever in developing nations, the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed the use of a vaccination program starting in 1999. Vaccinations have proven to be a great way at controlling outbreaks in high incidence areas. Just as important, it is also very cost-effective. Vaccination prices are normally low, less than US$1 per dose. Because the price is low, poverty-stricken communities are more willing to take advantage of the vaccinations.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Date KA, Bentsi-Enchill A, Marks F, Fox K | title = Typhoid fever vaccination strategies | journal = Vaccine | volume = 33 Suppl 3 | pages = C55-61 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25902360 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.028 }}</ref> Although vaccination programs for typhoid have proven to be effective, they alone cannot eliminate typhoid fever.<ref name=\":0\" /> Combining the use of vaccines with increasing public health efforts is the only proven way to control this disease.<ref name=\":0\" />

Since the 1990s, two typhoid fever vaccines have been recommended by the WHO. The ViPS vaccine is given via injection, while the Ty21a is taken through capsules. Only people 2 years or older are recommended to be vaccinated with the ViPS vaccine, and it requires a revaccination after 2–3 years with a 55–72% vaccine efficacy. The alternative Ty21a vaccine is recommended for people 5 years or older, and has a 5-7-year duration with a 51–67% vaccine efficacy. The two different vaccines have been proven as a safe and effective treatment for epidemic disease control in multiple regions.<ref name=\":0\"/>

Typhoid fever, when properly treated, is not fatal in most cases. Antibiotics, such as [[ampicillin]], chloramphenicol, [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]], [[amoxicillin]], and ciprofloxacin, have been commonly used to treat typhoid fever.<ref>Baron S et al.</ref> Treatment of the disease with antibiotics reduces the case-fatality rate to about 1%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index7.html |title=Diarrhoeal Diseases (Updated February 2009) |access-date=2013-04-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102190825/http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index7.html |archive-date=November 2, 2011 }}.

Without treatment, some patients develop sustained fever, bradycardia, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal symptoms, and occasionally, pneumonia. In white-skinned patients, pink spots, which fade on pressure, appear on the skin of the trunk in up to 20% of cases. In the third week, untreated cases may develop gastrointestinal and cerebral complications, which may prove fatal in up to 10–20% of cases. The highest case fatality rates are reported in children under 4 years. Around 2–5% of those who contract typhoid fever become chronic carriers, as bacteria persist in the biliary tract after symptoms have resolved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/ith/diseases/typhoidfever/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Typhoid fever|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-08-10|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727173454/http://www.who.int/ith/diseases/typhoidfever/en/|archive-date=2017-07-27}}</ref>

=== Surgery ===
Surgery is usually indicated if [[intestinal perforation]] occurs. One study found a 30-day mortality rate of 9% (8/88), and surgical site infections at 67% (59/88), with the disease burden borne predominantly by low-resource countries.<ref name=GlobalSurg2>{{cite journal | title = Management and Outcomes Following Surgery for Gastrointestinal Typhoid: An International, Prospective, Multicentre Cohort Study | journal = World Journal of Surgery | volume = 42 | issue = 10 | pages = 3179–3188 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 29725797 | pmc = 6132852 | doi = 10.1007/s00268-018-4624-8 | author1 = GlobalSurg Collaborative }}</ref>

For surgical treatment, most surgeons prefer simple closure of the perforation with drainage of the [[peritoneum]]. Small-bowel resection is indicated for patients with multiple perforations. If antibiotic treatment fails to eradicate the [[hepatobiliary]] carriage, the [[gallbladder]] should be resected. [[Cholecystectomy]] is not always successful in eradicating the carrier state because of persisting hepatic infection.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

=== Resistance ===
As resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and [[streptomycin]] is now common, these agents have not been used as first–line treatment of typhoid fever for almost 20 years.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Typhoid resistant to these agents is known as multidrug-resistant typhoid.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Ciprofloxacin resistance is an increasing problem, especially in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Many centres are shifting from using ciprofloxacin as the first line for treating suspected typhoid originating in South America, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Thailand, or Vietnam. For these people, the recommended first-line treatment is [[ceftriaxone]]. Also, [[azithromycin]] has been suggested to be better at treating resistant typhoid in  populations than both fluoroquinolone drugs and ceftriaxone.<ref name=\"pmid21975746\" /> Azithromycin can be taken by mouth and is less expensive than ceftriaxone which is given by injection.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gibani |first1=MM |last2=Britto |first2=C |last3=Pollard |first3=AJ |title=Typhoid and paratyphoid fever: a call to action. |journal=Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases |date=October 2018 |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=440–448 |doi=10.1097/QCO.0000000000000479 |pmid=30138141|pmc=6319573 }}</ref>

A separate problem exists with laboratory testing for reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin; current recommendations are that isolates should be tested simultaneously against ciprofloxacin (CIP) and against [[nalidixic acid]] (NAL), and that isolates that are sensitive to both CIP and NAL should be reported as \"sensitive to ciprofloxacin\", but that isolates testing sensitive to CIP but not to NAL should be reported as \"reduced sensitivity to ciprofloxacin\". However, an analysis of 271 isolates showed that around 18% of isolates with a reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ([[Minimum inhibitory concentration|MIC]] 0.125–1.0&nbsp;mg/l) would not be picked up by this method.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cooke FJ, Wain J, Threlfall EJ | title = Fluoroquinolone resistance in Salmonella Typhi | journal = BMJ | volume = 333 | issue = 7563 | pages = 353–4 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16902221 | pmc = 1539082 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.333.7563.353-b }}</ref> How this problem can be solved is not certain, because most laboratories around the world (including the West) are dependent on [[Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing|disk testing]] and cannot test for MICs.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

During the course of treatment of a typhoid outbreak in a local village in 1838, English country doctor [[William Budd]] realised the \"poisons\" involved in [[infectious disease]]s multiplied in the intestines of the sick, were present in their excretions, and could be transmitted to the healthy through their consumption of contaminated water.<ref>Asimov, ''[[Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology]]'' 2nd Revised edition</ref> He proposed strict isolation or quarantine as a method for containing such outbreaks in the future.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Aronson SM | title = William Budd and typhoid fever | journal = Rhode Island Medicine | volume = 78 | issue = 11 | pages = 310 | date = November 1995 | pmid = 8547718 }}</ref> The medical and scientific communities did not identify the role of microorganisms in infectious disease until the work of [[Robert Koch]] and [[Louis Pasteur]].<ref>John Tyndall, \"Introduction\", in René Vallery-Radot, trans.

===Organism involved===
[[File:Almroth Wright c1900.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Almroth Edward Wright]] developed the first effective typhoid vaccine.]]
In 1880, [[Karl Joseph Eberth]] described a bacillus that he suspected was the cause of typhoid.<ref>

Eberth's findings were verified by [[Robert Koch]]:  Koch, Robert (1881) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lD1AAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Zur Untersuchung von pathogenen Organismen\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423081253/https://books.google.com/books?id=lD1AAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1 |date=2017-04-23 }} (On the investigation of pathogenic organisms), ''Mitteilungen aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte'', '''1''' :  1–49; [https://books.google.com/books?id=lD1AAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA45#v=onepage&q&f=false see p. 45.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423000405/https://books.google.com/books?id=lD1AAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA45 |date=2017-04-23 }}</ref>  In 1884, pathologist [[Georg Theodor August Gaffky]] (1850–1918) confirmed Eberth's findings,<ref>Gaffky (1884) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6lQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA372#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Zur Aetiology des Abdominaltyphus\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423042158/https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6lQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA372 |date=2017-04-23 }} (On the etiology of abdominal typhus), ''Mittheilungen aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte'', '''2''' :   372–420.</ref> and the organism was given names such as Eberth's bacillus, ''Eberthella'' Typhi, and Gaffky-Eberth bacillus. Today, the bacillus that causes typhoid fever goes by the scientific name ''[[Salmonella enterica enterica]]'', serovar Typhi.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

=== Vaccine ===
British bacteriologist [[Almroth Edward Wright]] first developed an effective typhoid vaccine at the Army Medical School in [[Netley]], [[Hampshire]]. It was introduced in 1896 and used successfully by the British during the [[Boer War]] in South Africa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/649457/Sir-Almroth-Edward-Wright|title=Sir Almroth Edward Wright |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111031313/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/649457/Sir-Almroth-Edward-Wright |archive-date=2013-11-11 }}</ref> At that time, typhoid often killed more soldiers at war than were lost due to enemy combat. Wright further developed his vaccine at a newly opened research department at [[St Mary's Hospital (London)|St Mary's Hospital]] Medical School in London from 1902, where he established a method for measuring protective substances ([[opsonin]]) in human blood.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Citing the example of the [[Second Boer War]], during which many soldiers died from easily preventable diseases, Wright convinced the [[British Army]] that 10 million vaccine doses should be produced for the troops being sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], thereby saving up to half a million lives during [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=5&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27wright%27%29 |title=Library and Archive Catalogue |publisher=Royal Society |access-date=1 November 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> The British Army was the only combatant at the outbreak of the war to have its troops fully immunized against the bacterium. For the first time, their casualties due to combat exceeded those from disease.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medical lessons from World War I underscore need to keep developing antimicrobial drugs |url=https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2014/11/medical-lessons-world-war-i-underscore-need-keep-developing-antimicrobial-dru|website=MinnPost|access-date=8 September 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130210117/https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2014/11/medical-lessons-world-war-i-underscore-need-keep-developing-antimicrobial-dru|archive-date=30 January 2016|date=2014-11-11}}</ref>

In 1909, [[Frederick F. Russell]], a [[U.S. Army]] physician, adopted Wright's typhoid vaccine for use with the Army, and two years later, his vaccination program became the first in which an entire army was immunized. It eliminated typhoid as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. military.<ref name=\"USAMRMC\">{{cite book|title=USAMRMC: 50 Years of Dedication to the Warfighter 1958–2008|url=http://technologytransfer.amedd.army.mil/assets/docs/marketing/USAMRMC_history.pdf|publisher=U.S. Army Medical Research & Material Command (2008)|year=2008|page=5|asin=B003WYKJNY|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214210353/http://technologytransfer.amedd.army.mil/assets/docs/marketing/USAMRMC_history.pdf|archive-date=2013-02-14|access-date=2013-03-27}}</ref>

===Chlorination of water===
[[File:LizzieVanZyl.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Lizzie van Zyl]] was a child inmate in a British-run concentration camp in South Africa who died from typhoid fever during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] (1899–1902).]]
Most developed countries had declining rates of typhoid fever throughout the first half of the 20th century due to vaccinations and advances in public sanitation and hygiene. In 1893 attempts were made to chlorinate the water supply in [[Hamburg]], Germany and in 1897 [[Maidstone]], England was the first town to have its entire water supply chlorinated.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Typhoid Epidemic at Maidstone|date=October 1897|journal=Journal of the Sanitary Institute|volume=18|pages=388}}</ref>  In 1905, following an outbreak of typhoid fever, the City of [[Lincoln, England]] instituted permanent water chlorination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2008/08/25/9150211/chlorine-cleans-water-for-millions-but-comes-under-attack-after-health.html|title=A miracle for public health?|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>  The first permanent disinfection of drinking water in the US was made in 1908 to the [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], water supply. Credit for the decision to build the chlorination system has been given to [[John L. Leal]].<ref>Leal, John L. (1909). \"The Sterilization Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company at Boonton, N.J.\" ''Proceedings American Water Works Association.'' pp. 100–9.</ref> The [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] facility was designed by [[George W. Fuller]].<ref>Fuller, George W. (1909). \"Description of the Process and Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company for the Sterilization of the Water of the Boonton Reservoir.\" ''Proceedings American Water Works Association.'' 110-34.</ref>

===Antibiotics===
In 1942, doctors introduced antibiotics in clinical practice, greatly reducing mortality. 

==Terminology==
The disease has been referred to by various names, often associated with symptoms, such as gastric fever, enteric fever, abdominal typhus, infantile remittant fever, slow fever, nervous fever, pythogenic fever,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cerid.uw.edu/diseases/typhoid-fever|title=Typhoid Fever {{!}} Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases {{!}} University of Washington|website=cerid.uw.edu|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref> drain fever and low fever.<ref>{{Cite news|title=TYPHOID OR DRAIN FEVER, AND HOW TO PREVENT ITS SPREADING.|newspaper=[[Warwick Daily News|The Warwick Examiner and Times]]|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/82120702|date=6 April 1878|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

'''''Saw''''' is an American [[horror film|horror]] [[media franchise|franchise]] created by [[James Wan]] and [[Leigh Whannell]]. It consists of eight [[feature film]]s and additional media.

In 2003, Wan and Whannell made a [[Saw (2003 film)|short film]] to help [[Sales presentation|pitch]] a potential [[feature film]] concept. Their pitch was ultimately successful, and in 2004, [[Saw (2004 film)|the first installment]] of what would become the feature film franchise debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film was released theatrically that October, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The sequels were directed by [[Darren Lynn Bousman]], [[David Hackl]], and [[Kevin Greutert]], and were written by Wan, Whannell, Bousman, [[Patrick Melton]], and [[Marcus Dunstan]], and were released subsequently every October, on the Friday before [[Halloween]], between 2004 and 2010. Both of the creators remained with the franchise as [[executive producer]]s.

On July 22, 2010, producer [[Mark Burg]] confirmed that the seventh film, ''[[Saw 3D]]'', is the final installment of the series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowles|first=Scott|date=July 22, 2010|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=July 22, 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61r3dlvkb|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, Lionsgate reportedly expressed interest in continuing the franchise with a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]].<ref name=\"Lionsgate Remaking Saw\">{{cite web|title=Lionsgate Remaking Saw?|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/58024/lionsgate-remaking-saw|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref> In November 2013, it was reported that they were actively developing a sequel.<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com\">{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Lionsgate Is Actively Developing Next 'Saw'|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3262916/exclusive-lionsgate-is-actively-developing-next-saw/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting}}</ref> An eighth film, ''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'', was eventually released in October 2017. In 2019, a ninth film was announced, ''[[Spiral (2020 film)|Spiral]]'', with comedian and actor [[Chris Rock]] attached to star, produce, and co-write.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3561412/saw-reimagined-chris-rock-darren-bousman-returning-direct/|title=‘SAW’ Being Reimagined by Chris Rock with Darren Bousman Returning to Direct!|first=Brad|last=Miska|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=May 16, 2019|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>

The franchise primarily revolves around [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]], also called the \"Jigsaw Killer\" or simply \"Jigsaw\". He was introduced briefly in ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' and developed in more detail in ''[[Saw II]]'' and the subsequent films. Rather than killing his [[List of Saw characters|victims]] outright, Jigsaw traps them in situations that he calls \"tests\" or \"games\" to test their will to live through physical or psychological torture and believes that if they survive, they will be \"rehabilitated\". Despite the fact that John was murdered in ''[[Saw III]]'', the films continue to focus on the posthumous influence of the Jigsaw Killer and his apprentices by exploring his character via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]].

The franchise grossed more than {{US$|1 billion|long=no|link=yes}} from [[box office]] and retail sales by 2009,<ref>{{cite web|last=Lidz|first=Franz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/movies/25lidz.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2&hpw|title=Limbs Pile Up, and Money, Too|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 21, 2009|access-date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> and the films have collectively grossed over {{US$|976 million|long=no}} at the worldwide box office as of 2018. The film series as a whole has received mostly mixed to negative reviews by critics, but has been a financial success at the box office and is one of the highest-grossing horror film franchises of all time.

==Production==
Flashbacks from ''[[Saw IV]]'' reveal the roots of the series, presenting John Kramer as a successful [[Civil engineering|civil engineer]] and devoted husband to his wife [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]], who opened a rehab clinic for drug addicts. Jill lost her unborn baby, Gideon, due to the unwitting actions of a drug addict named [[List of Saw characters#Cecil Adams|Cecil]], who fled the scene. ''[[Saw VI]]'' later showed that another drug addict, [[Amanda Young]], also had an unintentional role in the death of Gideon. John grieved over the loss of his child and distanced himself from his friends and his wife.

John and Jill eventually drifted apart and divorced. After this turn of events, John found himself trapped by his own complacency until he was diagnosed with inoperable [[cancer]]. Extremely bitter over his squandered life and the loss of his unborn son, John began observing the lives of others and became even more depressed as he saw those around him squandering the gift of life that he had just been denied. John went to a man named William Easton to get money for a cancer treatment, but was denied. Flashbacks from ''[[Saw II]]'' show that, after surviving a [[suicide]] attempt where he drove his car off a cliff, John was \"reborn\", and nurtured the idea that the only way for someone to change is for them to change themselves. Then, in ''[[Saw IV]]'' flashbacks, he designed the first trap and test for Cecil and decided to use the rest of his existence to design more of these \"tests\" or \"games\" as a form of \"instant rehabilitation\" that would change the world, \"one person at a time\". John was soon given the name \"The Jigsaw Killer\" (or \"Jigsaw\"), because he removed a puzzle-piece-shaped chunk of flesh from those who did not escape his traps. John stated that this name was given to him by the media, and that the cut piece of flesh was meant to represent that these victims were each missing something—what he called the \"survival instinct\".

Few of Jigsaw's victims can survive his brutal mechanical traps, which are often [[irony|ironically]] [[symbol]]ic representations of the problems in the victim's life and require them to undergo severe physical and psychological [[torture]] to escape.

In ''[[Saw V]]'', police lieutenant [[Mark Hoffman]]'s ties with John are revealed in a series of flashbacks during the film. Hoffman's sister is murdered by her boyfriend, [[List of Saw characters#Seth Baxter|Seth Baxter]]. Seth is arrested; however, a technicality allowed him to be released, and Hoffman, feeling Seth had not served the full capacity of his sentence, kills him in an inescapable trap designed to look like one of Jigsaw's, laying the blame on him. Jigsaw then kidnaps Hoffman and blackmails him into becoming his apprentice in his \"rehabilitation\" methods, though eventually Hoffman would become a willing apprentice, helping set up John's tests from almost the beginning, starting with [[List of Saw characters#Paul Leahy|Paul]]'s trap.

The first surviving victim, [[Amanda Young]], views Jigsaw as a hero who ultimately changed her life for the better. Amanda, upon Jigsaw's request, agrees to become his [[Mentorship|protégée]]. After Amanda survives, John shows Jill her rehabilitation, and Jill then becomes knowledgeable of John's traps and becomes somewhat of an accomplice as well.

In ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'', Jigsaw has chained the man who diagnosed his cancer, [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]], in a dilapidated industrial washroom with [[List of Saw characters#Adam Stanheight|Adam Stanheight]], a photographer who has been tailing the doctor due to belief he is cheating on his wife. Lawrence has instructions to kill Adam by six o'clock, or else his wife and daughter will be killed. Flashbacks show detectives [[David Tapp]] and [[List of Saw characters#Steven Sing|Steven Sing]], who suspect Lawrence of being Jigsaw, following a trail of clues from other Jigsaw traps. Sing's death from a shotgun trap after saving a victim named Jeff causes Tapp to obsess over catching Jigsaw. Later on, he chases [[List of Saw characters#Zep Hindle|Zep Hindle]], who monitors Adam and Lawrence's tests, and gets shot in the chest. Eventually, Lawrence saws off his own foot in order to escape, leaving Adam in the bathroom while Lawrence goes to try to save his family and get help for Adam. It is later seen in ''Saw 3D'' that Lawrence found a steaming hot pipe and cauterized his wound, stopping the bleeding and ultimately surviving the trap. John catches up with Lawrence and makes him his next apprentice, a fact which he hides from his other accomplices. Flashbacks from ''Saw III'' show that Amanda kidnapped Adam and later returned to suffocate him as an act of \"mercy killing\".

''[[Saw II]]'' begins with the police tracking a severely weakened Jigsaw to his lair. However, another test is in place, as he and Amanda have kidnapped the son of Detective [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]] and trapped him and a group of seven convicts, previously framed by Eric, in a house that is slowly being filled with [[Sarin|sarin gas]], with Amanda Young among them. He will trade [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Matthews|Daniel Matthews]]' life for Eric's time, conversing with him until the game is concluded. Eric loses his patience and assaults Jigsaw, forcing him to take him to the house, only to discover that the video feed from inside the house had been pre-recorded, the events actually taking place much earlier; Eric's son was locked in a safe in Jigsaw's warehouse, being kept alive with an oxygen tank. Eric is knocked unconscious by a masked figure and wakes up imprisoned in the bathroom from ''Saw'', which is part of the foundation of the house. Amanda reveals herself to Eric as Jigsaw's protégée before leaving him to die. In a flashback from ''Saw III'', Eric manages to escape the bathroom by breaking his foot. He confronts and beats Amanda, demanding to know where his son is. Amanda fights him off and leaves him for dead. A flashback from ''Saw IV'' shows Hoffman later dragging Eric to a prison cell, keeping him alive for a future game.

The events of ''[[Saw III]]'' and ''[[Saw IV]]'' occur concurrently. ''Saw III'' begins with Jigsaw, weakened and near death, confined to a makeshift hospital bed. Amanda has taken over his work, designing traps of her own; however, these traps are inescapable, as Amanda is convinced that Jigsaw's traps have no effect and that people don't change. A [[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|kidnapped doctor]] is forced to keep Jigsaw alive while another test is performed on [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff]], a man obsessed with vengeance against the drunk driver who killed his son. Jigsaw, unwilling to allow a murderer to continue his legacy, designs a test for Amanda as well; she ultimately fails, and it results in the deaths of both Jigsaw and Amanda. ''Saw IV'', meanwhile, revolves around tests meant for [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Officer Daniel Rigg]], which are overseen by Hoffman. Rigg fails his test, resulting in the death of Eric Matthews. Rigg is left to bleed to death by Hoffman, who later discovers the bodies of Jigsaw and Amanda. When an [[autopsy]] is performed on Jigsaw, a [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] coated in wax is found in his [[stomach]]; the tape informs Hoffman that he is wrong to think that it is all over just because Jigsaw is dead, and he should not expect to go untested.

The events of ''[[Saw V]]'' show one of Hoffman's first solo tests, five people connected by different roles in a disastrous fire that killed several others are put into four interconnected tests of teamwork, killing off one person in each trap. The two remaining test subjects realize at the final trap that each previous trap was meant to be completed by each of the five people doing a small part, rather than killing one person per trap. With this knowledge, the two work together and barely manage to escape. They are found alive by Special Agent Erikson. Meanwhile, Hoffman has set up FBI Agent [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]] to appear to be Jigsaw's accomplice, while Strahm pursues Hoffman and is eventually killed due to his inability to follow Hoffman's rules, leaving Hoffman free to continue Jigsaw's \"work\".

''[[Saw VI]]'' begins with Hoffman setting up a game as per John's instructions left in a box for Jill during ''Saw V''. This game centers on insurance executive named [[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]] who oversees a team responsible for rejecting two-thirds of all insurance claims. As William progresses through four tests, he saves as many people as he can and learns the error of his choice to reject so many policies, which inherently \"kill\" the rejected. His last test is revealed to be a test of forgiveness by the family of [[List of Saw characters#Harold Abbott|Harold Abbott]], a man to whom William rejected a policy in the past, whose son ultimately chooses to kill William using [[hydrofluoric acid]]. Meanwhile, Agent Erickson and the-previously-thought-to-be-dead agent [[List of Saw characters#Lindsey Perez|Lindsey Perez]] search for Agent Strahm with the assistance of Hoffman. Upon finding irregularities in previous murder scenes, Perez and Erickson discover Hoffman's identity, but are killed by him before they can go public with his involvement. Hoffman travels back to the site of William's tests in which Jill attacks him to obey John's final request. She leaves Hoffman in a new Reverse Beartrap left behind by John, though does not leave a key for him to free himself. He is able to manipulate the trap and escapes wounded.

''[[Saw 3D]]'' picks up with Jill and Hoffman battling for control of Jigsaw's legacy. As Jill enters protective custody and makes Hoffman's true identity public, Hoffman sets up a new game involving [[skinhead]]s to find a way to Jill. Meanwhile, Bobby Dagen, a fraud who has written a book about escaping a Jigsaw trap he never experienced, is captured and forced to confront people who knew that he lied about being in a trap. Three of Dagen's friends die and his test concludes with him being forced to reenact the trap that he claimed to have survived before. He fails, which results in the death of his wife. Meanwhile, Hoffman has posed as a corpse and killed several officers to infiltrate the police station. He finds and kills Jill using the Reverse Beartrap. Hoffman attempts to leave town but is captured by Lawrence Gordon and his accomplices, then placed in the bathroom from the first film. Jigsaw is revealed to have aided Lawrence after his game and, in return, Lawrence helped him with subsequent traps. Hoffman is then left shackled in the bathroom to die.

''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'' begins with a new game presumably being conducted 10 years after the events of John Kramer's death in ''Saw III''. Five people are forced to undergo a series of tests in an abandoned barn, led by John. In the first test, one of the subjects is seemingly killed by buzzsaws after remaining unconscious during instruction. Most of the remaining subjects are killed throughout the game, until only two, Anna and the heavily wounded Ryan, are left. The two of them are drugged and wake up chained on opposite sides of a room. John is revealed to be in the room with them, and he provides them with a shotgun, explaining it is the \"key to their freedom\", before leaving them to escape. Anna attempts to kill Ryan with the shotgun, but the weapon was rigged to backfire, killing her and leaving Ryan to die. Meanwhile, police forces led by Detective Halloran and aided by medical forensic scientists Logan Nelson and Eleanor Bonneville attempt to discover the location and participants in the game, while also struggling to understand how the deceased John could be behind it all. Logan and Eleanor find the location of the game at an abandoned barn owned by Jill Tuck, with Halloran pursuing them, believing they are behind the most recent games. Eleanor is shown escaping, and Logan and Halloran are placed in a room with collars lined with laser cutters around their neck. They are told by John that they must confess their sins to survive. Logan is presumably killed after admitting his error delayed John's diagnosis. Halloran then confesses he let various guilty convicts walk free, deactivating his collar. However, Logan rises from the ground, revealing his collar was harmless. He explains that the game in the barn was the very first game that took place ten years earlier, and that the bodies found by the team were criminals that Halloran let walk free, who Logan placed into an identical game of his own. He reveals he was the participant in the first game who was presumably killed by the buzzsaws, but that John did not believe Logan should die simply because his \"crime\" was merely an accident, and rescued him as a result. John took Logan under his wing, and Logan aided John in all the various traps throughout the series, making him John's very first apprentice. Logan reactivates Halloran's collar, slicing his head open, before slamming the door shut.

===Recurring elements===
'''Billy'''
{{Main|Billy the Puppet}}
Billy is a puppet resembling a [[Ventriloquism#Ventriloquist.27s dummy|ventriloquist's dummy]], sometimes seen riding a [[tricycle]], that has appeared throughout the films and has become a type of [[mascot]] for the series. It is used by the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]] to communicate with his victims by delivering televised messages or occasionally in person to describe details of the sadistic traps and the means by which the victims could survive. Viewers have sometimes incorrectly identified the puppet itself as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]], because of its presence and connection to the killer.

Age and use of the puppet over the course of the films necessitated its reconstruction. According to [[James Wan|Wan]], the original puppet's face for ''Saw'' involved clay, [[papier-mâché]], and black ping-pong balls with the irises painted in for the eyes, but in later films more sophisticated construction included [[Water jet cutter|waterjet-cut]] foam for the body and remote-controlled [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronics]].<ref name=\"GreggJoBlopt2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/saw-2-diary-2|title=Saw 2: Dairy #2|last=Hoffman|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Hoffman|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]|page=2|date=May 13, 2005|access-date=August 24, 2011<!--|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61AcAwHaK|archive-date=August 24, 2011-->}}</ref>

The endurance and popularity of the franchise has resulted in the production of ''Billy'' merchandise, as well as references in other media and its use in promotions for the films.

'''\"Hello Zepp\"'''
{{Main|Hello Zepp}}

\"Hello Zepp\" is a piece of instrumental music that was originally composed by [[Charlie Clouser]] for the first film in the series. In ''Saw'', the implied villain, Zep Hindle, is revealed to actually be a victim of the Jigsaw Killer. (The character's name in the script is spelled \"Zep\", whereas the music titles are spelled \"Zepp\".)<ref>[http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Saw.html ''Saw'' script] on IMSDb. Accessed 2010-07-23.</ref><ref>[http://saw.ugo.com/?cur=saw-i-soundtrack ''Saw'' track listing] on [[UGO Networks|UGO]]. Accessed 2010-07-23.</ref> As the series continued, the piece was reused in every film as a [[leitmotif]], often being renamed and remixed to accommodate the changing situations and characters. The music was used in every ''Saw'' ending, usually during the revealing of plot revelations and twists which ''Saw'' films often use and it serves as the main theme tune for the whole films.

'''Traps'''<br />
An important component of each film is the variety of (usually mechanical in form) traps Jigsaw and his apprentices use on their captives to communicate his message.

According to [[David Hackl]], all of the traps are real objects, and not [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. They were designed to look horrific but ultimately be safe for the actors in them. Writer [[Marcus Dunstan]] said: \"It's built to function there on the day\", and added: \"It works. So if there's a scalping chair—there really was a chair with working gears to grind and pull your scalp back.\" The most potentially dangerous item was a \"water box\" used in ''[[Saw V]]'', in which one of the actors ([[Scott Patterson]], as [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]]) had to keep his head submerged as long as possible. Another element of the traps is that [[David Hackl|Hackl]] desired a specific look of rust and menace, but he also wanted them to have a type of beauty about them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/103/1039913p1.html|title=The Anatomy of a Trap: Saw|date=October 29, 2009|access-date=July 22, 2010|last=Monfette|first=Christopher|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61r3t1zc2|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Video games===
[[Japan]]ese video game company [[Konami]] currently owns the rights to the ''Saw'' interactive video game property. Konami stated in mid-2009 that they wanted to make ''Saw'' a series of video games to supplement the films. They also wish to make ''Saw'' their next big survival horror franchise next to their other property, ''[[Silent Hill]]''. They stated that because ''Saw'' focuses on visual intensity and ''Silent Hill'' focuses on psychological terror, both could exist in the video game industry without directly competing against each other.<ref name= \"Will Saw Be Konami's Second Great Horror Franchise?\">{{cite news|url=http://weblogs.variety.com/the_cut_scene/2009/04/silent-hill-say-hello-to-your-new-brother-jigsawkonami-has-confirmed-an-earlier-cut-scene-report-that-it-has-bought-the-pub.html|title=Will Saw Be Konami's Second Great Horror Franchise?|work=The Cut Scene|date=2009-04-02|access-date=2009-08-04}}</ref>

===Comic books===
''Saw: Rebirth'', a [[comic book]] prequel to the original film released to promote ''Saw II''. Its [[canon (fiction)|canonicity]] was later contradicted by events in ''Saw IV''.

===Theme park attractions===
* \"[[Saw: The Ride]]\" is a [[Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter]] roller coaster themed around the franchise, which opened on March 13, 2009, at [[Thorpe Park]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

* In 2010, \"[[Halloween Fright Nights]]\" at [[Warner Bros. Movie World]] featured a maze created by [[Sudden Impact Entertainment]], featuring characters, traps and scenes from the films. The maze was simply titled \"Saw Maze\".

'''''Saw''''' is an American [[horror film|horror]] [[media franchise|franchise]] created by [[James Wan]] and [[Leigh Whannell]]. It consists of eight [[feature film]]s and additional media.

In 2003, Wan and Whannell made a [[Saw (2003 film)|short film]] to help [[Sales presentation|pitch]] a potential [[feature film]] concept. Their pitch was ultimately successful, and in 2004, [[Saw (2004 film)|the first installment]] of what would become the feature film franchise debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film was released theatrically that October, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The sequels were directed by [[Darren Lynn Bousman]], [[David Hackl]], and [[Kevin Greutert]], and were written by Wan, Whannell, Bousman, [[Patrick Melton]], and [[Marcus Dunstan]], and were released subsequently every October, on the Friday before [[Halloween]], between 2004 and 2010. Both of the creators remained with the franchise as [[executive producer]]s.

On July 22, 2010, producer [[Mark Burg]] confirmed that the seventh film, ''[[Saw 3D]]'', is the final installment of the series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowles|first=Scott|date=July 22, 2010|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=July 22, 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61r3dlvkb|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, Lionsgate reportedly expressed interest in continuing the franchise with a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]].<ref name=\"Lionsgate Remaking Saw\">{{cite web|title=Lionsgate Remaking Saw?|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/58024/lionsgate-remaking-saw|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref> In November 2013, it was reported that they were actively developing a sequel.<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com\">{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Lionsgate Is Actively Developing Next 'Saw'|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3262916/exclusive-lionsgate-is-actively-developing-next-saw/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting}}</ref> An eighth film, ''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'', was eventually released in October 2017. In 2019, a ninth film was announced, ''[[Spiral (2020 film)|Spiral]]'', with comedian and actor [[Chris Rock]] attached to star, produce, and co-write.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3561412/saw-reimagined-chris-rock-darren-bousman-returning-direct/|title=‘SAW’ Being Reimagined by Chris Rock with Darren Bousman Returning to Direct!|first=Brad|last=Miska|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=May 16, 2019|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>

The franchise primarily revolves around [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]], also called the \"Jigsaw Killer\" or simply \"Jigsaw\". He was introduced briefly in ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' and developed in more detail in ''[[Saw II]]'' and the subsequent films. Rather than killing his [[List of Saw characters|victims]] outright, Jigsaw traps them in situations that he calls \"tests\" or \"games\" to test their will to live through physical or psychological torture and believes that if they survive, they will be \"rehabilitated\". Despite the fact that John was murdered in ''[[Saw III]]'', the films continue to focus on the posthumous influence of the Jigsaw Killer and his apprentices by exploring his character via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]].

The franchise grossed more than {{US$|1 billion|long=no|link=yes}} from [[box office]] and retail sales by 2009,<ref>{{cite web|last=Lidz|first=Franz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/movies/25lidz.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2&hpw|title=Limbs Pile Up, and Money, Too|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 21, 2009|access-date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> and the films have collectively grossed over {{US$|976 million|long=no}} at the worldwide box office as of 2018. The film series as a whole has received mostly mixed to negative reviews by critics, but has been a financial success at the box office and is one of the highest-grossing horror film franchises of all time. While the films have been classified as [[Splatter film#Torture porn|torture porn]] by some critics,<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Sharrett|first=Christopher|title=The Problem of Saw: \"Torture Porn\" and the Conservatism of Contemporary Horror Films|magazine=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]|number=1|volume=35|date=December 2009|pages=32–37 |jstor= 41690851 |url=https://baixardoc.com/preview/the-problem-of-saw-torture-porn-horror-films-irony-5cf03d786626c |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191016013623/https://baixardoc.com/preview/the-problem-of-saw-torture-porn-horror-films-irony-5cf03d786626c |archivedate= 2019-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117941442 | last=Nelson|first=Rob| title=Saw VI Movie Review | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | date=October 23, 2009 | access-date=December 8, 2009| archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5n3nfI0IX | archive-date=January 25, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/saw-vi-film-review-93699|title=Saw VI – Film Review|last=Scheck|first=Frank|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=October 23, 2009|access-date=September 15, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61jQpk10a|archive-date=September 15, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> the creators of ''Saw'' disagree with that term.<ref name=\"AVClub\">{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/saw-creators-leigh-whannell-and-james-wan,46975/|title=Saw creators Leigh Whannell and James Wan|last=Tobias|first=Scott|work=[[The A.V.

==Production==
Flashbacks from ''[[Saw IV]]'' reveal the roots of the series, presenting John Kramer as a successful [[Civil engineering|civil engineer]] and devoted husband to his wife [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]], who opened a rehab clinic for drug addicts. Jill lost her unborn baby, Gideon, due to the unwitting actions of a drug addict named [[List of Saw characters#Cecil Adams|Cecil]], who fled the scene. ''[[Saw VI]]'' later showed that another drug addict, [[Amanda Young]], also had an unintentional role in the death of Gideon. John grieved over the loss of his child and distanced himself from his friends and his wife.

John and Jill eventually drifted apart and divorced. After this turn of events, John found himself trapped by his own complacency until he was diagnosed with inoperable [[cancer]]. Extremely bitter over his squandered life and the loss of his unborn son, John began observing the lives of others and became even more depressed as he saw those around him squandering the gift of life that he had just been denied. John went to a man named William Easton to get money for a cancer treatment, but was denied. Flashbacks from ''[[Saw II]]'' show that, after surviving a [[suicide]] attempt where he drove his car off a cliff, John was \"reborn\", and nurtured the idea that the only way for someone to change is for them to change themselves. Then, in ''[[Saw IV]]'' flashbacks, he designed the first trap and test for Cecil and decided to use the rest of his existence to design more of these \"tests\" or \"games\" as a form of \"instant rehabilitation\" that would change the world, \"one person at a time\". John was soon given the name \"The Jigsaw Killer\" (or \"Jigsaw\"), because he removed a puzzle-piece-shaped chunk of flesh from those who did not escape his traps. John stated that this name was given to him by the media, and that the cut piece of flesh was meant to represent that these victims were each missing something—what he called the \"survival instinct\".

Few of Jigsaw's victims can survive his brutal mechanical traps, which are often [[irony|ironically]] [[symbol]]ic representations of the problems in the victim's life and require them to undergo severe physical and psychological [[torture]] to escape.

In ''[[Saw V]]'', police lieutenant [[Mark Hoffman]]'s ties with John are revealed in a series of flashbacks during the film. Hoffman's sister is murdered by her boyfriend, [[List of Saw characters#Seth Baxter|Seth Baxter]]. Seth is arrested; however, a technicality allowed him to be released, and Hoffman, feeling Seth had not served the full capacity of his sentence, kills him in an inescapable trap designed to look like one of Jigsaw's, laying the blame on him. Jigsaw then kidnaps Hoffman and blackmails him into becoming his apprentice in his \"rehabilitation\" methods, though eventually Hoffman would become a willing apprentice, helping set up John's tests from almost the beginning, starting with [[List of Saw characters#Paul Leahy|Paul]]'s trap.

The first surviving victim, [[Amanda Young]], views Jigsaw as a hero who ultimately changed her life for the better. Amanda, upon Jigsaw's request, agrees to become his [[Mentorship|protégée]]. After Amanda survives, John shows Jill her rehabilitation, and Jill then becomes knowledgeable of John's traps and becomes somewhat of an accomplice as well.

In ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'', Jigsaw has chained the man who diagnosed his cancer, [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]], in a dilapidated industrial washroom with [[List of Saw characters#Adam Stanheight|Adam Stanheight]], a photographer who has been tailing the doctor due to belief he is cheating on his wife. Lawrence has instructions to kill Adam by six o'clock, or else his wife and daughter will be killed. Flashbacks show detectives [[David Tapp]] and [[List of Saw characters#Steven Sing|Steven Sing]], who suspect Lawrence of being Jigsaw, following a trail of clues from other Jigsaw traps. Sing's death from a shotgun trap after saving a victim named Jeff causes Tapp to obsess over catching Jigsaw. Later on, he chases [[List of Saw characters#Zep Hindle|Zep Hindle]], who monitors Adam and Lawrence's tests, and gets shot in the chest. Eventually, Lawrence saws off his own foot in order to escape, leaving Adam in the bathroom while Lawrence goes to try to save his family and get help for Adam. It is later seen in ''Saw 3D'' that Lawrence found a steaming hot pipe and cauterized his wound, stopping the bleeding and ultimately surviving the trap. John catches up with Lawrence and makes him his next apprentice, a fact which he hides from his other accomplices. Flashbacks from ''Saw III'' show that Amanda kidnapped Adam and later returned to suffocate him as an act of \"mercy killing\".

''[[Saw II]]'' begins with the police tracking a severely weakened Jigsaw to his lair. However, another test is in place, as he and Amanda have kidnapped the son of Detective [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]] and trapped him and a group of seven convicts, previously framed by Eric, in a house that is slowly being filled with [[Sarin|sarin gas]], with Amanda Young among them. He will trade [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Matthews|Daniel Matthews]]' life for Eric's time, conversing with him until the game is concluded. Eric loses his patience and assaults Jigsaw, forcing him to take him to the house, only to discover that the video feed from inside the house had been pre-recorded, the events actually taking place much earlier; Eric's son was locked in a safe in Jigsaw's warehouse, being kept alive with an oxygen tank. Eric is knocked unconscious by a masked figure and wakes up imprisoned in the bathroom from ''Saw'', which is part of the foundation of the house. Amanda reveals herself to Eric as Jigsaw's protégée before leaving him to die. In a flashback from ''Saw III'', Eric manages to escape the bathroom by breaking his foot. He confronts and beats Amanda, demanding to know where his son is. Amanda fights him off and leaves him for dead. A flashback from ''Saw IV'' shows Hoffman later dragging Eric to a prison cell, keeping him alive for a future game.

The events of ''[[Saw III]]'' and ''[[Saw IV]]'' occur concurrently. ''Saw III'' begins with Jigsaw, weakened and near death, confined to a makeshift hospital bed. Amanda has taken over his work, designing traps of her own; however, these traps are inescapable, as Amanda is convinced that Jigsaw's traps have no effect and that people don't change. A [[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|kidnapped doctor]] is forced to keep Jigsaw alive while another test is performed on [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff]], a man obsessed with vengeance against the drunk driver who killed his son. Jigsaw, unwilling to allow a murderer to continue his legacy, designs a test for Amanda as well; she ultimately fails, and it results in the deaths of both Jigsaw and Amanda. ''Saw IV'', meanwhile, revolves around tests meant for [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Officer Daniel Rigg]], which are overseen by Hoffman. Rigg fails his test, resulting in the death of Eric Matthews. Rigg is left to bleed to death by Hoffman, who later discovers the bodies of Jigsaw and Amanda. When an [[autopsy]] is performed on Jigsaw, a [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] coated in wax is found in his [[stomach]]; the tape informs Hoffman that he is wrong to think that it is all over just because Jigsaw is dead, and he should not expect to go untested.

The events of ''[[Saw V]]'' show one of Hoffman's first solo tests, five people connected by different roles in a disastrous fire that killed several others are put into four interconnected tests of teamwork, killing off one person in each trap. The two remaining test subjects realize at the final trap that each previous trap was meant to be completed by each of the five people doing a small part, rather than killing one person per trap. With this knowledge, the two work together and barely manage to escape. They are found alive by Special Agent Erikson. Meanwhile, Hoffman has set up FBI Agent [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]] to appear to be Jigsaw's accomplice, while Strahm pursues Hoffman and is eventually killed due to his inability to follow Hoffman's rules, leaving Hoffman free to continue Jigsaw's \"work\".

''[[Saw VI]]'' begins with Hoffman setting up a game as per John's instructions left in a box for Jill during ''Saw V''. This game centers on insurance executive named [[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]] who oversees a team responsible for rejecting two-thirds of all insurance claims. As William progresses through four tests, he saves as many people as he can and learns the error of his choice to reject so many policies, which inherently \"kill\" the rejected. His last test is revealed to be a test of forgiveness by the family of [[List of Saw characters#Harold Abbott|Harold Abbott]], a man to whom William rejected a policy in the past, whose son ultimately chooses to kill William using [[hydrofluoric acid]]. Meanwhile, Agent Erickson and the-previously-thought-to-be-dead agent [[List of Saw characters#Lindsey Perez|Lindsey Perez]] search for Agent Strahm with the assistance of Hoffman. Upon finding irregularities in previous murder scenes, Perez and Erickson discover Hoffman's identity, but are killed by him before they can go public with his involvement. Hoffman travels back to the site of William's tests in which Jill attacks him to obey John's final request. She leaves Hoffman in a new Reverse Beartrap left behind by John, though does not leave a key for him to free himself. He is able to manipulate the trap and escapes wounded.

''[[Saw 3D]]'' picks up with Jill and Hoffman battling for control of Jigsaw's legacy. As Jill enters protective custody and makes Hoffman's true identity public, Hoffman sets up a new game involving [[skinhead]]s to find a way to Jill. Meanwhile, Bobby Dagen, a fraud who has written a book about escaping a Jigsaw trap he never experienced, is captured and forced to confront people who knew that he lied about being in a trap. Three of Dagen's friends die and his test concludes with him being forced to reenact the trap that he claimed to have survived before. He fails, which results in the death of his wife. Meanwhile, Hoffman has posed as a corpse and killed several officers to infiltrate the police station. He finds and kills Jill using the Reverse Beartrap. Hoffman attempts to leave town but is captured by Lawrence Gordon and his accomplices, then placed in the bathroom from the first film. Jigsaw is revealed to have aided Lawrence after his game and, in return, Lawrence helped him with subsequent traps. Hoffman is then left shackled in the bathroom to die.

''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'' begins with a new game presumably being conducted 10 years after the events of John Kramer's death in ''Saw III''. Five people are forced to undergo a series of tests in an abandoned barn, led by John. In the first test, one of the subjects is seemingly killed by buzzsaws after remaining unconscious during instruction. Most of the remaining subjects are killed throughout the game, until only two, Anna and the heavily wounded Ryan, are left. The two of them are drugged and wake up chained on opposite sides of a room. John is revealed to be in the room with them, and he provides them with a shotgun, explaining it is the \"key to their freedom\", before leaving them to escape. Anna attempts to kill Ryan with the shotgun, but the weapon was rigged to backfire, killing her and leaving Ryan to die. Meanwhile, police forces led by Detective Halloran and aided by medical forensic scientists Logan Nelson and Eleanor Bonneville attempt to discover the location and participants in the game, while also struggling to understand how the deceased John could be behind it all. Logan and Eleanor find the location of the game at an abandoned barn owned by Jill Tuck, with Halloran pursuing them, believing they are behind the most recent games. Eleanor is shown escaping, and Logan and Halloran are placed in a room with collars lined with laser cutters around their neck. They are told by John that they must confess their sins to survive. Logan is presumably killed after admitting his error delayed John's diagnosis. Halloran then confesses he let various guilty convicts walk free, deactivating his collar. However, Logan rises from the ground, revealing his collar was harmless. He explains that the game in the barn was the very first game that took place ten years earlier, and that the bodies found by the team were criminals that Halloran let walk free, who Logan placed into an identical game of his own. He reveals he was the participant in the first game who was presumably killed by the buzzsaws, but that John did not believe Logan should die simply because his \"crime\" was merely an accident, and rescued him as a result. John took Logan under his wing, and Logan aided John in all the various traps throughout the series, making him John's very first apprentice. Logan reactivates Halloran's collar, slicing his head open, before slamming the door shut.

'''Billy'''
{{Main|Billy the Puppet}}
Billy is a puppet resembling a [[Ventriloquism#Ventriloquist.27s dummy|ventriloquist's dummy]], sometimes seen riding a [[tricycle]], that has appeared throughout the films and has become a type of [[mascot]] for the series. It is used by the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]] to communicate with his victims by delivering televised messages or occasionally in person to describe details of the sadistic traps and the means by which the victims could survive. Viewers have sometimes incorrectly identified the puppet itself as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]], because of its presence and connection to the killer.

Age and use of the puppet over the course of the films necessitated its reconstruction. According to [[James Wan|Wan]], the original puppet's face for ''Saw'' involved clay, [[papier-mâché]], and black ping-pong balls with the irises painted in for the eyes, but in later films more sophisticated construction included [[Water jet cutter|waterjet-cut]] foam for the body and remote-controlled [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronics]].<ref name=\"GreggJoBlopt2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/saw-2-diary-2|title=Saw 2: Dairy #2|last=Hoffman|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Hoffman|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]|page=2|date=May 13, 2005|access-date=August 24, 2011<!--|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61AcAwHaK|archive-date=August 24, 2011-->}}</ref>

The endurance and popularity of the franchise has resulted in the production of ''Billy'' merchandise, as well as references in other media and its use in promotions for the films.

'''\"Hello Zepp\"'''
{{Main|Hello Zepp}}

\"Hello Zepp\" is a piece of instrumental music that was originally composed by [[Charlie Clouser]] for the first film in the series. In ''Saw'', the implied villain, Zep Hindle, is revealed to actually be a victim of the Jigsaw Killer. (The character's name in the script is spelled \"Zep\", whereas the music titles are spelled \"Zepp\".)<ref>[http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Saw.html ''Saw'' script] on IMSDb. Accessed 2010-07-23.</ref><ref>[http://saw.ugo.com/?cur=saw-i-soundtrack ''Saw'' track listing] on [[UGO Networks|UGO]]. Accessed 2010-07-23.</ref> As the series continued, the piece was reused in every film as a [[leitmotif]], often being renamed and remixed to accommodate the changing situations and characters. The music was used in every ''Saw'' ending, usually during the revealing of plot revelations and twists which ''Saw'' films often use and it serves as the main theme tune for the whole films.

'''Traps'''<br />
An important component of each film is the variety of (usually mechanical in form) traps Jigsaw and his apprentices use on their captives to communicate his message.

According to [[David Hackl]], all of the traps are real objects, and not [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. They were designed to look horrific but ultimately be safe for the actors in them. Writer [[Marcus Dunstan]] said: \"It's built to function there on the day\", and added: \"It works. So if there's a scalping chair—there really was a chair with working gears to grind and pull your scalp back.\" The most potentially dangerous item was a \"water box\" used in ''[[Saw V]]'', in which one of the actors ([[Scott Patterson]], as [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]]) had to keep his head submerged as long as possible. Another element of the traps is that [[David Hackl|Hackl]] desired a specific look of rust and menace, but he also wanted them to have a type of beauty about them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/103/1039913p1.html|title=The Anatomy of a Trap: Saw|date=October 29, 2009|access-date=July 22, 2010|last=Monfette|first=Christopher|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61r3t1zc2|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Japan]]ese video game company [[Konami]] currently owns the rights to the ''Saw'' interactive video game property. Konami stated in mid-2009 that they wanted to make ''Saw'' a series of video games to supplement the films. They also wish to make ''Saw'' their next big survival horror franchise next to their other property, ''[[Silent Hill]]''.

In August 1993, Vikernes fatally stabbed Mayhem guitarist [[Euronymous]] during an altercation at the latter's apartment, and was arrested shortly after. In May 1994, Vikernes was convicted of [[first-degree murder]], church arson and possession of explosives, and sentenced to 21 years in prison. He said the killing was [[self-defense]] and unsuccessfully argued for the charge to be reduced to [[voluntary manslaughter]].

==Biography==
Much of the information about Vikernes comes from the 1998 book ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos]]'' ([[Feral House]]) which covers the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]]. [[Michael Jenkins Moynihan|Michael Moynihan]], one of the book's authors, was sympathetic with Vikernes and his extremist politics,<ref name=\"Coogan\">Coogan 1999</ref><ref name=ward>{{cite news |last1=Ward |first1=Eric K. |last2=Lunsford |first2=John |last3=Massa |first3=Justin |title=Black Metal Spreads Neo-Nazi Hate Message |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/1999/black-metal-spreads-neo-nazi-hate-message |accessdate=21 March 2019 |work=Intelligence Report |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |date=Fall 1999 |language=en}}</ref> although Moynihan later made statements denouncing the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] and white supremacism.<ref name=WWLORD>{{cite news|last1=Dundas|first1=Zach|title=Lord of Chaos: Activists Accuse Portland Writer and Musician Michael Moynihan of Spreading Extremist Propaganda, But They're Not Telling the Whole Story|url=http://wweek.com/html/leada081600.html|accessdate=20 March 2018|work=[[Willamette Week]]|date=26 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010301171407/http://www.wweek.com/html/leada081600.html|archivedate=1 March 2001|quote=}}</ref>

===Background and childhood===
In the interviews printed in ''Lords of Chaos'', Vikernes discusses his background and childhood. ''Lords of Chaos'' also includes an interview with his mother, Helene Bore (the book and a newspaper depicted there refer to her with the given name Lene,<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|pp=142, 316}}</ref> whereas Vikernes' own website uses the name Helene<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/gallery01.php ''Varg Vikernes in Childhood''], accessed on 28 March 2013.</ref>). In a 2004 interview, Vikernes said his mother was \"working in a large oil company\". His father is an electronics engineer, and his older brother is a civil engineer.<ref name=LoC148/><ref name=\"BZINT\">{{cite web |title=Interview with Varg Vikernes (12.08.2004), by BG |url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2004_interview_bg.shtml |website=Burzum.org |accessdate=21 March 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720084952/http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2004_interview_bg.shtml |archivedate=20 July 2018}}</ref>

In the ''Lords of Chaos'' interview, Vikernes recalls that when he was 6 years old, the family moved for about a year to [[Baghdad]], Iraq, because Vikernes' \"father was working for [[Saddam Hussein]]\" developing a computer program.<ref name=LoC147>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=147}}</ref> Since there were no places available in the English school in Baghdad, the young Vikernes went to an Iraqi elementary school during this time. According to his interview, Vikernes here became \"aware of racial matters\".<ref name=LoC148>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=148}}</ref> [[Corporal punishment]] was not uncommon in the school, and on one occasion, Vikernes had a \"quarrel\" with a teacher and called him \"a monkey\". But as Vikernes perceived it the teachers \"didn't dare to hit me because I was white\".<ref name=LoC148 /> Vikernes' mother also recalls how they \"spent a year in Iraq\" and that \"the other children in his class would get slapped by their teachers; he would not\".<ref name=LoC142>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=142}}</ref> She mentions that this created problems, but generally she \"has no good explanation\" of how Varg developed his views.<ref name=LoC144>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=144}}</ref>

When asked about his father, Vikernes states that he \"had a [[swastika]] flag at home.\"<ref name=LoC147 /> However, Vikernes feels that his father was a hypocrite because he was worried about Vikernes \"being a Nazi\", whereas he too was \"pissed about all the colored people he saw in town\".<ref name=LoC147 /> About his mother, Vikernes states that she was \"very race conscious\", in the sense that she was afraid that Vikernes \"was going to come home with a black girl!\"<ref name=LoC146>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=146}}</ref> At the time of the 1995 ''Lords of Chaos'' interview, Vikernes still had a positive relationship with his mother but \"very little contact\" with his father.<ref name=LoC147 /> He also stated that his parents are divorced; Vikernes' father is said to have \"left about 10 years ago\", which would have been 1985, when Vikernes was 11 or 12.<ref name=LoC147 />

The ''[[Encyclopedia of White Power]]''<ref name=\"XC319\"/> and historian [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]<ref name=\"GC204\">{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=204}}</ref> have both alleged that Vikernes was part of the [[White power skinhead|neo-Nazi skinhead]] culture as an adolescent.<ref name=\"GC204\"/> When asked in the ''Lords of Chaos'' interview whether he hung out with skinheads in Bergen, Vikernes said that: \"there were no skinheads in Bergen.\"<ref name=\"LoC149\"/>

A fan of classical music as a child, [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] in particular, Vikernes started listening to [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] at 12, citing [[Iron Maiden]] as his biggest inspiration.<ref name = \"Heart of Darkness\">{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2010_interview_guitar_world.shtml |title=Burzum: Heart of Darkness \"Guitar World\" Magazine (April 2010) by Brad Angle |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=18 July 2014}}</ref> Later he discovered other metal bands whose sound would be influential on his own band, such as [[Kreator]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]], [[Pestilence (band)|Pestilence]], [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]] and [[Von (band)|Von]].<ref name = \"Heart of Darkness\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://metalasfuck.net/zine/articles/2012/%E2%80%9Cyou-can-add-rotting-christ-list%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-burzum%E2%80%99s-varg-vikernes-shares-his-metal-faves-meta |title=\"You can add Rotting Christ to the list\" – Burzum's Varg Vikernes shares his metal faves with Metal as Fuck!|publisher=metalasfuck.net |accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref> Although [[Venom (band)|Venom]] are widely considered the primary influence on black metal, Vikernes has always denied to be influenced by them, as well as defining the band as \"a joke\". He once wore a T-shirt of Venom's ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' to promote the genre but stated he later regretted doing that.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noisecreep.com/burzum-varg-vikernes-does-not-care-about-black-metal/ |title=Varg Vikernes Of Burzum Talks New Album \"Fallen\" |publisher=Noisecreep.com|accessdate=18 July 2014}}</ref>

From an early age, Vikernes was also fascinated with the fictional realm of [[Middle-earth]] created by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. His stage name, Grishnackh, is taken from that of an orc in ''[[The Two Towers]]'', while the band name Burzum, meaning \"darkness,\" was taken from the [[Black Speech]] inscribed on the [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The inscription read \"Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk agh ''burzum''-ishi krimpatul,\" or in English, \"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the ''darkness'' bind them.\" Additionally, before joining the Bergen [[death metal]] band [[Old Funeral]], he was in a band called [[Uruk-hai|Uruk-Hai]], also a reference from Tolkien's text.<ref name=\"burzum origin\"/>

===Early musical career===
{{Further|Burzum}}
Vikernes started playing guitar at the age of 14.<ref name=\"LoC149\">{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=149}}</ref> When he was 17, Vikernes came into contact with members of Old Funeral. He played guitar with them during 1990–1991 and performed on their ''Devoured Carcass'' EP before he began his solo musical project, [[Burzum]], and quickly became involved with the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]].

Vikernes has stated that for the recording of these early albums he used an old Westone guitar, which he had bought in 1987 from an acquaintance.<ref name = \"burzummusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story06.shtml |title=A Burzum Story: Part VI – The Music |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=20 August 2011}}</ref> He used the cheapest bass guitar there was in his local shop and 
borrowed a drum kit from Old Funeral, the successor band [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], and \"another musician living nearby\".<ref name = \"burzummusic\"/> On ''[[Hvis lyset tar oss]]'', he also borrowed [[Hellhammer (musician)|Hellhammer]]'s drum kit, the same one Hellhammer used to record ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'' by [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Teufel |url=http://www.teufelstomb.com/interviews/mayhem-1999/ |title=Interview with Hellhammer |publisher=Teufels Tomb |accessdate=20 August 2011}}</ref> He used a Peavey amplifier, but for the recording of ''[[Filosofem]]'', he used the amplifier on his brother's stereo and some old fuzz pedals.<ref name = \"burzummusic\"/> For vocals, he would use whatever microphone the sound tech handed him, but during the recording of ''Filosofem'', he intentionally used the worst mic they had, a headset mic.<ref name = \"burzummusic\"/> On the track \"Dungeons of Darkness\", he used the large gong at [[Grieghallen]] for background noise ([[Euronymous]] assisted him by beating his fists on it).<ref name = \"burzummusic\"/>

In 1992, Vikernes joined the black metal band [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], a year after band member [[Per \"Dead\" Ohlin|Dead]] committed suicide on 8 April 1991.<ref name=\":0\" />

===Arson of churches===
On 6 June 1992, the [[Fantoft Stave Church]], dating from the 12th century and considered architecturally significant, was burned to the ground by arson. By January 1993, arson attacks had occurred on at least seven other major [[stave church]]es, including one on Christmas Eve of 1992.<ref name=\"GC204\"/> Vikernes was found guilty of several of these cases: the arson and attempted arson of [[Åsane Church]] and [[Storetveit Church]]in [[Bergen]], the arson of [[Skjold Church (Rogaland)|Skjold Church]] in [[Vindafjord]], and the arson of [[Holmenkollen Chapel]] in Oslo. He was also charged with the arson of Fantoft Stave Church, although the jurors found him not guilty. The judges called this an error but did not overthrow the whole case.<ref name=burzumstory2>{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story02.shtml |title=Varg Vikernes – A Burzum Story: Part II – Euronymous |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=20 August 2011}}</ref>

At the time, media outlets reported that Vikernes was associated with [[theistic Satanism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1993|pp=344–45}}</ref> In later interviews Vikernes, while not accepting responsibility for the arsons, said that they were not Satanic, but instead \"revenge\" for the Christian desecration of Viking graves and temples. According to Vikernes, the arsons were on the anniversary of the [[Lindisfarne#Vikings|Lindisfarne Viking raid]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=88 |ps=, quoted in: {{harvtxt|Gardell|2003|p=306}}}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gardell|2003|pp=306, 307 |ps=, translation by Gardell}}</ref> Vikernes claimed that all the burnings, except for the one at Stavanger, were done by one person.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=89}} (May have been 1998 edition).</ref>

====''Bergens Tidende'' article====
In January 1993, an article in one of Norway's biggest newspapers, ''[[Bergens Tidende]]'', brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight.<ref name=LoC95-97>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|pp=95–97}}</ref> Two friends of Vikernes interviewed him and brought the interview to the newspaper, hoping they would print it.<ref name=LoC95-97/> In the anonymous interview, \"Count Grishnackh\" (Vikernes) claimed to have burnt the churches and killed a man in Lillehammer.<ref name=LoC95-97/> ''BT'' journalist Finn Bjørn Tønder set up a meeting with Count Grishnackh with help from the friends. The journalists were summoned to an apartment and reportedly warned that they would be shot if the police were called.<ref name=LoC95-97/> There, Vikernes and his companions told the journalists that they had burnt the churches, or knew who had done it, and said that the attacks would continue. They claimed to be devil worshippers and said: \"Our intention is to spread fear and devilry [...] that is why we are telling this to ''Bergens Tidende''.\" They gave the journalists details about the arsons that hadn't been released to the press, so ''BT'' spoke with the police before publishing it, who confirmed these details.<ref name=LoC95-97/>

The article was published on 20 January as the front page of the ''BT''. It was headlined \"We Lit the Fires\" and included a photo of Vikernes, his face mostly hidden, holding two large knives. However, by the time the article was printed, Vikernes had already been arrested. The police found him by going to an address printed on a Burzum flyer.<ref name=LoC95-97/>

According to Vikernes, the anonymous interview was planned by himself and Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal, and get more customers for [[Helvete (store)|Helvete]].<ref name=\"Count Regrets Nothing\">{{cite web|accessdate=29 November 2017|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2009_interview_dagbladet.shtml|title=\"Count\" Regrets Nothing (04.07.2009), by Rune Midtskogen|location=Telemark, Norway|website=www.burzum.org|publisher=[[Dagbladet]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120729085215/http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2009_interview_dagbladet.shtml|archivedate=29 July 2012}}</ref> At the time, Burzum was about to release the ''[[Aske (EP)|Aske]]'' mini-album.<ref name=LoC95-97/> Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence.<ref name=LoC95-97/> [[Jørn Inge Tunsberg]] of [[Hades Almighty|Hades]] said that the interview had \"grave consequences\" for the rest of the scene and that they did not know he was going to talk to the press, as \"he had said nothing\". He added that they became \"bloody angry\" and he, Tunsberg, was \"pissed off\".<ref>Torstein Grude: ''[[Satan rir media]]'', 1998.</ref>

Norwegian magazine ''Rock Furore'' published an interview with Vikernes in February 1993. In it, he said of the prison system: \"It's much too nice here. It's not hell at all. In this country prisoners get a bed, toilet and shower. It's completely ridiculous. I asked the police to throw me in a real dungeon, and also encouraged them to use violence\".<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=42}}</ref> He was released in March for lack of evidence.<ref name=LoC95-97/>

===Murder of Øystein Aarseth===
{{Main|Murder of Euronymous}}

In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes.<ref name=LoC117>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=117}}</ref> After the ''Bergens Tidende'' episode, Euronymous decided to shut Helvete as it began to draw the attention of the police and media.<ref name=LoC120>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=120}}</ref>

On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death at his apartment in Oslo. The murder was initially blamed on Swedish black metallers by the media.<ref name=LoC117/> It has been speculated that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records (Euronymous owed Vikernes a large sum of [[royalty payment]]s),<ref name=LoC120/> or an attempt at \"outdoing\" a recent stabbing in Lillehammer committed by Emperor drummer Faust.<ref name=Yahoo>[http://music.yahoo.com/mayhem/biography/ Mayhem Biography on Yahoo! Music]</ref> Vikernes claims that he killed Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an [[electroshock weapon]], tie him up, and [[torture]] him to death while [[snuff film|videotaping the event]].<ref name=LoC125-128>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|pp=125–128}}</ref> Vikernes explains: \"If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn't have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me\".<ref name=untilthelight>{{cite video |people=Aaron Aites (director, producer), Audrey Ewell (director, producer) |year=2009 |title=[[Until the Light Takes Us]] |url= |medium=motion picture |language= |trans_title= |publisher=Variance Films}}</ref> He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned [[contract]] to ambush him.<ref name=untilthelight/>

On the night of the murder, Vikernes and [[Snorre Ruch|Snorre \"Blackthorn\" Ruch]] drove from Bergen to Euronymous' apartment at Tøyengata in Oslo.<ref name=purefucking>{{cite video |people=Stefan Rydehed (director) |year=2008 |title=Pure Fucking Mayhem |url= |medium=motion picture |language= |trans_title= |publisher=Index Verlag}}</ref> Blackthorn allegedly stood in the stairwell smoking while Vikernes went to Euronymous' apartment on the fourth floor.<ref name=LoC125-128/> Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door to hand him the signed contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous \"panicked\" and kicked him in the chest.<ref name=burzumstory2/><ref name=LoC125-128/> Vikernes claims Euronymous ran into the kitchen to fetch a knife.<ref name=burzumstory2/><ref name=LoC125-128/> The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. His body was found in the stairwell on the first floor with 23 stab wounds—two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back. Vikernes claims his final stab to the skull was so powerful the knife remained stuck in Euronymous’ skull, but no physical evidence or bodily injuries support his claim.<ref>Steinke, Darcey. \"Satan's Cheerleaders\". ''[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]''. February 1996.</ref> Vikernes contends that most of Euronymous' wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle.<ref name=burzumstory2/><ref name=LoC125-128/> After the murder, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes.<ref name=burzumstory2/><ref name=LoC125-128/> This claim of self-defense is doubted by [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] drummer [[Faust (musician)|Faust]],<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=123}}</ref> but Mayhem bassist [[Necrobutcher]] believes Vikernes killed Euronymous due to the aforementioned death threats he received from him.<ref>{{cite news |last=Campion |first=Chris |date=20 February 2005 |title=In the face of death |url=https://amp.theguardian.com/music/2005/feb/20/popandrock4 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=[[London]] |access-date=30 December 2018 |quote='Øystein was always sending death threats to people,' says Necro Butcher.

So when eventually he got to be unfriendly with Varg, he threatened him like he did everyone else. Øystein told him, \"I'm going to send some people to torture you. Until you die.\" But Varg Vikernes saw this as a real threat. He probably thought, \"better him than me. I'll just go down and do him\".'}}</ref>

Blackthorn claims Vikernes planned to murder Euronymous and pressured him into coming along. He claims that, in the summer of 1993, he was almost [[Involuntary commitment|committed]] to a [[psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]] but fled to Bergen and stayed with Vikernes. Blackthorn said of the murder, \"I was neither for nor against it. I didn't give a shit about Øystein\".<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=130}}</ref> Vikernes, however, claims that he had not planned the killing and that Blackthorn came along to show Euronymous some new guitar riffs.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=135}}</ref> Vikernes called Blackthorn's claims a \"defense [...] to make sure I couldn't blame ''him'' [for the murder]\".<ref name=burzumstory2/>

[[File:Blitzhuset.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blitz (movement)|The Blitz House]], which Vikernes allegedly planned to blow up in 1993.]]
Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen.<ref name=LoC120/> The police found 150&nbsp;kg of explosives and 3,000 rounds of ammunition in his home.<ref name=\"Dagbladet.no\">{{cite web |author=Midtskogen, Rune |title=\"Greven\" angrer ingenting |date=4 July 2009 |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/07/04/magasinet/innenriks/kriminalomsorg/kirkebrann/drapsdom/7051663/ |accessdate=25 August 2009 |language=Norwegian |trans-title=\"The Count\" regrets nothing}}</ref> According to the ''Encyclopedia of White Power'', Vikernes \"intended to blow up [[Blitz (movement)|Blitz House]], the radical leftist and anarchist enclave in Oslo\",<ref name=\"XC319\"/> a plan which \"was reportedly on the verge of execution.\"<ref name=\"XC319\"/> In an article originally published in 1999, [[Kevin Coogan]] also mentioned Vikernes' alleged intent to \"destroy an Oslo-based punk anti-fascist squat called Blitz House,\"<ref name=\"Coogan\"/> and stated \"Vikernes may have felt that he had no choice but to kill Euronymous before bombing Blitz House because 'the Communist' would almost certainly have opposed such an act.\"<ref name=\"Coogan\"/> Vikernes denied these claims in a 2009 interview, stating \"I was getting [the explosives and ammunition] in order to defend Norway if we were attacked any time. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union could have decided to attack us. We have no reason to trust neither the government, the royal family or the military because of [[Norwegian campaign|what happened last time we were attacked]]. We are left to ourselves.\"<ref name=\"Dagbladet.no\"/>

====Trial====
Vikernes' trial began on 2 May 1994; he was represented by the lawyer [[Stein-Erik Mattsson]].<ref>Sortland, Kjersti, & Bjørn Reese. 1997. \"Greven\" opprørt. ''VG'' (13 April): 9.</ref> Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were put on trial around the same time. Some of them confessed to their crimes and implicated others. According to ''Lords of Chaos'', \"Vikernes is disgusted by the fact that, while he held fast to a code of silence, others confessed.\"<ref name=LoC141>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}}</ref>

During the trial the media made Vikernes \"the nation's first real bogeyman in fifty years\".<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=145}}</ref> At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn, and another friend had planned the murder. The court alleged that this third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi; to make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes' credit card.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=129}}</ref>

On 16 May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150&nbsp;kg of explosives.<ref name=\"Count Regrets Nothing\"/> Though Vikernes only confessed to the theft and storage of the explosives, two churches were set on fire the day he was sentenced, \"presumably as a statement of symbolic support\".<ref name=LoC141/> Blackthorn, who hadn't taken part in the murder as he had gone down the condominium's stairs to smoke, was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice.<ref name=LoC141/>

May 1994 also saw the release of Mayhem's album ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'', which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Campion |coauthors= |title=In the Face of Death |date=20 February 2005 |publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1419364,00.html |work=[[The Observer]] |pages= | accessdate=6 October 2007}}</ref> Before the release, Euronymous' family had asked Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said \"I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts, but I never did.\"<ref name=guardian/>

===Imprisonment===
Vikernes served his sentence at the prisons in Bergen, [[Tønsberg]], [[Ringerike Prison|Ringerike]], [[Trondheim Prison|Trondheim]], and [[Tromsø]].

According to Swedish scholar [[Matthias Gardell]] in his book ''[[Gods of the Blood]]'', Vikernes launched the [[Heathen Front|Norwegian Heathen Front]] (''Norsk Hedensk Front'') during his early years in prison.<ref name=\"gardell307\">{{harvnb|Gardell|2003|p=307|ps=, quote: \"Advocating national socialism, anti-Semitism, eugenics, and racist paganism, Vikernes launched Norsk Hedensk Front in 1993, which soon evolved into a network of independent tribes called the Allgermanische Heidnische Front (AHF)\"}}</ref> Gardell says this was a [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|pagan]] [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] group which grew into the international Pan-Germanic<!--This is the correct translation: Germanisch=Germanic, referring to the historic Germanic tribes, not to inhabitants of contemporary Germany--> Heathen Front (''Allgermanische Heidnische Front'' or AHF).<ref name=\"gardell307\"/> According to Xavier Cattarinich, Vikernes was the \"self-proclaimed leader\" of the Norwegian Heathen Front<ref name=\"XC319\">{{harvnb|Cattarinich|2000|p=319}}</ref> and Goodrick-Clarke mentions that Vikernes underlined \"his role as chieftain of his Norwegian Heathen Front\" with the writing of ''Vargsmål''.<ref name=\"GC205\">{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=205}}</ref> The Heathen Front officially denied that Vikernes was in charge. According to the authors of ''Lord of Chaos'', this may have been to protect him, as Norwegian prisoners were prohibited from leading political groups. In addition, the organization's listed address was the same PO box Vikernes used in prison, which the authors state would have made it \"very hard for him [Vikernes] to do an effective job\" at leading the organization, as all letters would have been screened by the prison personnel.<ref name=\"loc\">{{cite book |last1=Moynihan |first1=Michael J. |last2=Søderlind |first2=Didrik |authorlink1=Michael Jenkins Moynihan |authorlink2=Didrik Søderlind |title=Lords of chaos : the bloody rise of the satanic metal underground |date=2003 |publisher=Feral House |isbn=9781932595529 |page=177 |edition=New |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0xjCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA177#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref> Vikernes said \"I have never formed or been a member of such organizations. The only organization I am a member of is [[Riksmål Society|Riksmålsforbundet]]\" (''The Society for the Preservation of Traditional Standard Norwegian'').<ref name=\"Dagbladet.no\"/> 

On 8 April 1997, Norwegian police arrested five neo-Nazis in [[Hemnes]]. According to police, the young men were part of a self-styled \"[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe]]\" and were plotting attacks on political and religious figures in Norway. They also had plans to break Vikernes out of prison.<ref name=LOC362>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=362}}</ref> The group \"had all the trappings of a paramilitary unit\", including guns, explosives, bulletproof vests, steel helmets and balaclavas.<ref name=LOC362/> One of its members, Tom Eiternes, had befriended Vikernes in prison before escaping while on leave.<ref name=LOC362/> Vikernes' mother, Lene Bore, was arrested for supplying the group with 100,000 [[Norwegian krone|kroner]]. She confessed, but claimed she did not know they were \"right-wing extremists\" and said her son was being attacked by fellow inmates. In late 1996, his jaw had reportedly been broken in a fight with another inmate. However, the prison director said her claims were unfounded, and police suspected that the money came from Vikernes himself.<ref name=LOC362/> ''Lords of Chaos'' says that Vikernes adopted a \"[[White power skinhead|skinhead]]\" look and wore a belt buckle with SS insignia around this time.<ref name=LOC362/> Despite her confession, Bore was not convicted,<ref name=LOC362/> and in 1998 the case against the \"Einsatzgruppe\" was dropped.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=369}}</ref>

During his time in prison, Vikernes recorded two albums made up wholly of [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[neofolk]] music. The first, ''[[Dauði Baldrs]]'', was recorded in 1994–1995 and released in October 1997. The second, ''[[Hliðskjálf (album)|Hliðskjálf]]'', was recorded in 1998 and released in April 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intro.de/kuenstler/interviews/23043719/norwegischer-black-metal-als-die-kirchen-brannten |title=Norwegischer Black Metal |language=de |publisher=Intro.de |accessdate=20 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719050131/http://www.intro.de/kuenstler/interviews/23043719/norwegischer-black-metal-als-die-kirchen-brannten |archive-date=19 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Vikernes was denied access to an electric guitar, bass guitar or drums, and instead used a synthesizer. In 2000, Vikernes decided to put Burzum on hold. He believed that his philosophy was constantly misinterpreted by an ignorant fan base that was too closely related to black metal and Satanism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/lords_of_chaos_review.shtml |title=Varg Vikernes – A review of M.

In it, he wrote that he had received death threats and another inmate had tried to strangle him shortly after the newspaper article was published.<ref name=blabberoct27/> For his actions, thirteen months were added to Vikernes' sentence and he was moved to a prison in Ringerike. In July 2004, he was moved to a maximum-security prison in Trondheim. The last three years of his sentence were spent in [[Tromsø Prison]].

[[File:Varg Vikernes-3.jpg|thumb|Vikernes serving his last year in prison, 2009.]]

When Vikernes was convicted, it was possible to be released on parole after serving 12 years of a 21-year sentence, but in 2002, before he became eligible, the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] had extended this to 14 years. In June 2006, after serving 12 years, Vikernes was denied parole by the Department of Criminal Justice for this reason.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> His lawyer, [[John Christian Elden]], has complained that the policy change is a form of [[Ex post facto law|retroactive legislation]]. Article 97 of the Norwegian constitution forbids any law being given retroactive force.

===Life after prison===
Vikernes continued with Burzum after his release. He released a further three black metal albums: ''[[Belus (album)|Belus]]'' (2010), ''[[Fallen (Burzum album)|Fallen]]'' (2011) and ''[[Umskiptar]]'' (2012) and a compilation of re-recorded songs (''[[From the Depths of Darkness]]'').

Vikernes was one of the recipients of far-right terrorist [[Anders Breivik]]'s manifesto, which Breivik sent out before launching the [[2011 Norway attacks]], killing 77 people. Although Vikernes condemned Breivik's actions, this drew the attention of the French authorities.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-norway-breivik/man-linked-to-norwegian-mass-killer-breivik-arrested-in-france-idUSBRE96F0FY20130716 \"Man linked to Norwegian mass killer Breivik arrested in France\"].

Vikernes's YouTube channel was removed from the platform in June 2019. This coincided with an announcement from YouTube that it would be more aggressive in removing extremist content and [[hate speech]] which violated its terms of service. Vikernes said he did not know exactly why his channel was removed.

In late 2019, Vikernes announced on his Twitter that he intended to release another album as Burzum.

==Writing==
[[File:Vargsmål.gif|thumb|right|''Vargsmål'', written by Vikernes in 1994]]

In late 1994, while in prison, Vikernes wrote a Norwegian-language book called ''Vargsmål'' (\"Varg's Speech\"<ref name=vargbooks/>). Vikernes has said he wrote ''Vargsmål'' to defend himself against the media. According to ''Lords of Chaos'', ''Vargsmål'' became available on the Internet for some time in 1996 but not in a printed form.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=159}}</ref> In 1997, a Norwegian publisher released a paperback edition of the book; its publication was financed by Vikernes' mother, Helene Bore.<ref name = \"hist\">{{cite book |last=Christe |first=Ian |title=Sound of the Beast: the Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Inc. |year=2003 |location=New York City |page=279 |url= |id= |isbn=}}</ref> As of 1999, ''Vargsmål'' was being sold by the neo-Nazi organization [[Heathen Front]] via its website.<ref name=ward/>

In 1998 he wrote a book called ''Germansk Mytologi og Verdensanskuelse'' (\"Teutonic Mythology and Worldview\").<ref name=vargbooks>{{cite web |last1=Vikernes |first1=Varg |title=A Comment To \"Vargsmål\" And Other Books By Varg Vikernes |url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_comment_to_vargsmal_and_other_books_by_varg_vikernes.shtml |website=Burzum.org |accessdate=22 March 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114043306/http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_comment_to_vargsmal_and_other_books_by_varg_vikernes.shtml |archivedate=14 January 2019}}</ref>

By late 2003, Vikernes had begun writing articles for Burzum.org, which became the official Burzum website.<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2010_interview_terrorizer.shtml Interview with Varg Vikernes for \"Terrorizer\" Magazine (#194, March 2010), by James Minton]. Burzum.org. Retrieved 4 April 2013.</ref> He also wrote for his personal blog, Thulean Perspective, which was set up in January 2013. The website Ancestral Cult was created by him and his wife.

Vikernes has self-published a [[tabletop role-playing game]] named ''MYFAROG''. In 2019, he announced plans to release an ambient album of Burzum music, called 'Thulean Mysteries', intended as background music for the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.deathmetal.org/news/burzum-announces-new-album-thulean-mysteries/|title=Burzum Announces New Album Thulêan Mysteries|website=www.deathmetal.org|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref>

In August 1993, Vikernes fatally stabbed Mayhem guitarist [[Euronymous]] during an altercation at the latter's apartment, and was arrested shortly after. In May 1994, Vikernes was convicted of [[first-degree murder]], church arson and possession of explosives, and sentenced to 21 years in prison. He said the killing was [[self-defense]] and unsuccessfully argued for the charge to be reduced to [[voluntary manslaughter]].

==Biography==
Much of the information about Vikernes comes from the 1998 book ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos]]'' ([[Feral House]]) which covers the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]]. [[Michael Jenkins Moynihan|Michael Moynihan]], one of the book's authors, was sympathetic with Vikernes and his extremist politics,<ref name=\"Coogan\">Coogan 1999</ref><ref name=ward>{{cite news |last1=Ward |first1=Eric K. |last2=Lunsford |first2=John |last3=Massa |first3=Justin |title=Black Metal Spreads Neo-Nazi Hate Message |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/1999/black-metal-spreads-neo-nazi-hate-message |accessdate=21 March 2019 |work=Intelligence Report |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |date=Fall 1999 |language=en}}</ref> although Moynihan later made statements denouncing the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] and white supremacism.<ref name=WWLORD>{{cite news|last1=Dundas|first1=Zach|title=Lord of Chaos: Activists Accuse Portland Writer and Musician Michael Moynihan of Spreading Extremist Propaganda, But They're Not Telling the Whole Story|url=http://wweek.com/html/leada081600.html|accessdate=20 March 2018|work=[[Willamette Week]]|date=26 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010301171407/http://www.wweek.com/html/leada081600.html|archivedate=1 March 2001|quote=}}</ref>

===Background and childhood===
In the interviews printed in ''Lords of Chaos'', Vikernes discusses his background and childhood. ''Lords of Chaos'' also includes an interview with his mother, Helene Bore (the book and a newspaper depicted there refer to her with the given name Lene,<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|pp=142, 316}}</ref> whereas Vikernes' own website uses the name Helene<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/gallery01.php ''Varg Vikernes in Childhood''], accessed on 28 March 2013.</ref>). In a 2004 interview, Vikernes said his mother was \"working in a large oil company\". His father is an electronics engineer, and his older brother is a civil engineer.<ref name=LoC148/><ref name=\"BZINT\">{{cite web |title=Interview with Varg Vikernes (12.08.2004), by BG |url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2004_interview_bg.shtml |website=Burzum.org |accessdate=21 March 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720084952/http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2004_interview_bg.shtml |archivedate=20 July 2018}}</ref>

In the ''Lords of Chaos'' interview, Vikernes recalls that when he was 6 years old, the family moved for about a year to [[Baghdad]], Iraq, because Vikernes' \"father was working for [[Saddam Hussein]]\" developing a computer program.<ref name=LoC147>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=147}}</ref> Since there were no places available in the English school in Baghdad, the young Vikernes went to an Iraqi elementary school during this time. According to his interview, Vikernes here became \"aware of racial matters\".<ref name=LoC148>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=148}}</ref> [[Corporal punishment]] was not uncommon in the school, and on one occasion, Vikernes had a \"quarrel\" with a teacher and called him \"a monkey\". But as Vikernes perceived it the teachers \"didn't dare to hit me because I was white\".<ref name=LoC148 /> Vikernes' mother also recalls how they \"spent a year in Iraq\" and that \"the other children in his class would get slapped by their teachers; he would not\".<ref name=LoC142>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=142}}</ref> She mentions that this created problems, but generally she \"has no good explanation\" of how Varg developed his views.<ref name=LoC144>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=144}}</ref>

When asked about his father, Vikernes states that he \"had a [[swastika]] flag at home.\"<ref name=LoC147 /> However, Vikernes feels that his father was a hypocrite because he was worried about Vikernes \"being a Nazi\", whereas he too was \"pissed about all the colored people he saw in town\".<ref name=LoC147 /> About his mother, Vikernes states that she was \"very race conscious\", in the sense that she was afraid that Vikernes \"was going to come home with a black girl!\"<ref name=LoC146>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=146}}</ref> At the time of the 1995 ''Lords of Chaos'' interview, Vikernes still had a positive relationship with his mother but \"very little contact\" with his father.<ref name=LoC147 /> He also stated that his parents are divorced; Vikernes' father is said to have \"left about 10 years ago\", which would have been 1985, when Vikernes was 11 or 12.<ref name=LoC147 />

The ''[[Encyclopedia of White Power]]''<ref name=\"XC319\"/> and historian [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]<ref name=\"GC204\">{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=204}}</ref> have both alleged that Vikernes was part of the [[White power skinhead|neo-Nazi skinhead]] culture as an adolescent.<ref name=\"GC204\"/> When asked in the ''Lords of Chaos'' interview whether he hung out with skinheads in Bergen, Vikernes said that: \"there were no skinheads in Bergen.\"<ref name=\"LoC149\"/>

A fan of classical music as a child, [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] in particular, Vikernes started listening to [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] at 12, citing [[Iron Maiden]] as his biggest inspiration.<ref name = \"Heart of Darkness\">{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2010_interview_guitar_world.shtml |title=Burzum: Heart of Darkness \"Guitar World\" Magazine (April 2010) by Brad Angle |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=18 July 2014}}</ref> Later he discovered other metal bands whose sound would be influential on his own band, such as [[Kreator]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]], [[Pestilence (band)|Pestilence]], [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]] and [[Von (band)|Von]].<ref name = \"Heart of Darkness\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://metalasfuck.net/zine/articles/2012/%E2%80%9Cyou-can-add-rotting-christ-list%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-burzum%E2%80%99s-varg-vikernes-shares-his-metal-faves-meta |title=\"You can add Rotting Christ to the list\" – Burzum's Varg Vikernes shares his metal faves with Metal as Fuck!|publisher=metalasfuck.net |accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref> Although [[Venom (band)|Venom]] are widely considered the primary influence on black metal, Vikernes has always denied to be influenced by them, as well as defining the band as \"a joke\". He once wore a T-shirt of Venom's ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' to promote the genre but stated he later regretted doing that.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noisecreep.com/burzum-varg-vikernes-does-not-care-about-black-metal/ |title=Varg Vikernes Of Burzum Talks New Album \"Fallen\" |publisher=Noisecreep.com|accessdate=18 July 2014}}</ref>

From an early age, Vikernes was also fascinated with the fictional realm of [[Middle-earth]] created by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. His stage name, Grishnackh, is taken from that of an orc in ''[[The Two Towers]]'', while the band name Burzum, meaning \"darkness,\" was taken from the [[Black Speech]] inscribed on the [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The inscription read \"Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk agh ''burzum''-ishi krimpatul,\" or in English, \"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the ''darkness'' bind them.\" Additionally, before joining the Bergen [[death metal]] band [[Old Funeral]], he was in a band called [[Uruk-hai|Uruk-Hai]], also a reference from Tolkien's text.<ref name=\"burzum origin\"/>

===Early musical career===
{{Further|Burzum}}
Vikernes started playing guitar at the age of 14.<ref name=\"LoC149\">{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=149}}</ref> When he was 17, Vikernes came into contact with members of Old Funeral. He played guitar with them during 1990–1991 and performed on their ''Devoured Carcass'' EP before he began his solo musical project, [[Burzum]], and quickly became involved with the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]]. During 1992–1993, he recorded four albums as Burzum.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/articles/features/a_brief_history_of_the_early_norwegian_black_metal_scene_part_1-65713|title=A Brief History Of The Early Norwegian Black Metal Scene. Part 1|access-date=29 September 2017}}</ref>

Vikernes has stated that for the recording of these early albums he used an old Westone guitar, which he had bought in 1987 from an acquaintance.<ref name = \"burzummusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story06.shtml |title=A Burzum Story: Part VI – The Music |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=20 August 2011}}</ref> He used the cheapest bass guitar there was in his local shop and 
borrowed a drum kit from Old Funeral, the successor band [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], and \"another musician living nearby\".<ref name = \"burzummusic\"/> On ''[[Hvis lyset tar oss]]'', he also borrowed [[Hellhammer (musician)|Hellhammer]]'s drum kit, the same one Hellhammer used to record ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'' by [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Teufel |url=http://www.teufelstomb.com/interviews/mayhem-1999/ |title=Interview with Hellhammer |publisher=Teufels Tomb |accessdate=20 August 2011}}</ref> He used a Peavey amplifier, but for the recording of ''[[Filosofem]]'', he used the amplifier on his brother's stereo and some old fuzz pedals.<ref name = \"burzummusic\"/> For vocals, he would use whatever microphone the sound tech handed him, but during the recording of ''Filosofem'', he intentionally used the worst mic they had, a headset mic.<ref name = \"burzummusic\"/> On the track \"Dungeons of Darkness\", he used the large gong at [[Grieghallen]] for background noise ([[Euronymous]] assisted him by beating his fists on it).<ref name = \"burzummusic\"/>

In 1992, Vikernes joined the black metal band [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], a year after band member [[Per \"Dead\" Ohlin|Dead]] committed suicide on 8 April 1991.<ref name=\":0\" />

===Arson of churches===
On 6 June 1992, the [[Fantoft Stave Church]], dating from the 12th century and considered architecturally significant, was burned to the ground by arson. By January 1993, arson attacks had occurred on at least seven other major [[stave church]]es, including one on Christmas Eve of 1992.<ref name=\"GC204\"/> Vikernes was found guilty of several of these cases: the arson and attempted arson of [[Åsane Church]] and [[Storetveit Church]]in [[Bergen]], the arson of [[Skjold Church (Rogaland)|Skjold Church]] in [[Vindafjord]], and the arson of [[Holmenkollen Chapel]] in Oslo. He was also charged with the arson of Fantoft Stave Church, although the jurors found him not guilty. The judges called this an error but did not overthrow the whole case.<ref name=burzumstory2>{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story02.shtml |title=Varg Vikernes – A Burzum Story: Part II – Euronymous |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=20 August 2011}}</ref>

At the time, media outlets reported that Vikernes was associated with [[theistic Satanism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1993|pp=344–45}}</ref> In later interviews Vikernes, while not accepting responsibility for the arsons, said that they were not Satanic, but instead \"revenge\" for the Christian desecration of Viking graves and temples. According to Vikernes, the arsons were on the anniversary of the [[Lindisfarne#Vikings|Lindisfarne Viking raid]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=88 |ps=, quoted in: {{harvtxt|Gardell|2003|p=306}}}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gardell|2003|pp=306, 307 |ps=, translation by Gardell}}</ref> Vikernes claimed that all the burnings, except for the one at Stavanger, were done by one person.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=89}} (May have been 1998 edition).</ref>

====''Bergens Tidende'' article====
In January 1993, an article in one of Norway's biggest newspapers, ''[[Bergens Tidende]]'', brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight.<ref name=LoC95-97>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|pp=95–97}}</ref> Two friends of Vikernes interviewed him and brought the interview to the newspaper, hoping they would print it.<ref name=LoC95-97/> In the anonymous interview, \"Count Grishnackh\" (Vikernes) claimed to have burnt the churches and killed a man in Lillehammer.<ref name=LoC95-97/> ''BT'' journalist Finn Bjørn Tønder set up a meeting with Count Grishnackh with help from the friends. The journalists were summoned to an apartment and reportedly warned that they would be shot if the police were called.<ref name=LoC95-97/> There, Vikernes and his companions told the journalists that they had burnt the churches, or knew who had done it, and said that the attacks would continue. They claimed to be devil worshippers and said: \"Our intention is to spread fear and devilry [...] that is why we are telling this to ''Bergens Tidende''.\" They gave the journalists details about the arsons that hadn't been released to the press, so ''BT'' spoke with the police before publishing it, who confirmed these details.<ref name=LoC95-97/>

The article was published on 20 January as the front page of the ''BT''. It was headlined \"We Lit the Fires\" and included a photo of Vikernes, his face mostly hidden, holding two large knives. However, by the time the article was printed, Vikernes had already been arrested. The police found him by going to an address printed on a Burzum flyer.<ref name=LoC95-97/>

According to Vikernes, the anonymous interview was planned by himself and Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal, and get more customers for [[Helvete (store)|Helvete]].<ref name=\"Count Regrets Nothing\">{{cite web|accessdate=29 November 2017|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2009_interview_dagbladet.shtml|title=\"Count\" Regrets Nothing (04.07.2009), by Rune Midtskogen|location=Telemark, Norway|website=www.burzum.org|publisher=[[Dagbladet]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120729085215/http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2009_interview_dagbladet.shtml|archivedate=29 July 2012}}</ref> At the time, Burzum was about to release the ''[[Aske (EP)|Aske]]'' mini-album.<ref name=LoC95-97/> Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence.<ref name=LoC95-97/> [[Jørn Inge Tunsberg]] of [[Hades Almighty|Hades]] said that the interview had \"grave consequences\" for the rest of the scene and that they did not know he was going to talk to the press, as \"he had said nothing\". He added that they became \"bloody angry\" and he, Tunsberg, was \"pissed off\".<ref>Torstein Grude: ''[[Satan rir media]]'', 1998.</ref>

Norwegian magazine ''Rock Furore'' published an interview with Vikernes in February 1993. In it, he said of the prison system: \"It's much too nice here. It's not hell at all. In this country prisoners get a bed, toilet and shower. It's completely ridiculous. I asked the police to throw me in a real dungeon, and also encouraged them to use violence\".<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=42}}</ref> He was released in March for lack of evidence.<ref name=LoC95-97/>

===Murder of Øystein Aarseth===
{{Main|Murder of Euronymous}}

In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes.<ref name=LoC117>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=117}}</ref> After the ''Bergens Tidende'' episode, Euronymous decided to shut Helvete as it began to draw the attention of the police and media.<ref name=LoC120>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=120}}</ref>

On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death at his apartment in Oslo. The murder was initially blamed on Swedish black metallers by the media.<ref name=LoC117/> It has been speculated that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records (Euronymous owed Vikernes a large sum of [[royalty payment]]s),<ref name=LoC120/> or an attempt at \"outdoing\" a recent stabbing in Lillehammer committed by Emperor drummer Faust.<ref name=Yahoo>[http://music.yahoo.com/mayhem/biography/ Mayhem Biography on Yahoo!

Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen.<ref name=LoC120/> The police found 150&nbsp;kg of explosives and 3,000 rounds of ammunition in his home.<ref name=\"Dagbladet.no\">{{cite web |author=Midtskogen, Rune |title=\"Greven\" angrer ingenting |date=4 July 2009 |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/07/04/magasinet/innenriks/kriminalomsorg/kirkebrann/drapsdom/7051663/ |accessdate=25 August 2009 |language=Norwegian |trans-title=\"The Count\" regrets nothing}}</ref> According to the ''Encyclopedia of White Power'', Vikernes \"intended to blow up [[Blitz (movement)|Blitz House]], the radical leftist and anarchist enclave in Oslo\",<ref name=\"XC319\"/> a plan which \"was reportedly on the verge of execution.\"<ref name=\"XC319\"/> In an article originally published in 1999, [[Kevin Coogan]] also mentioned Vikernes' alleged intent to \"destroy an Oslo-based punk anti-fascist squat called Blitz House,\"<ref name=\"Coogan\"/> and stated \"Vikernes may have felt that he had no choice but to kill Euronymous before bombing Blitz House because 'the Communist' would almost certainly have opposed such an act.\"<ref name=\"Coogan\"/> Vikernes denied these claims in a 2009 interview, stating \"I was getting [the explosives and ammunition] in order to defend Norway if we were attacked any time.

====Trial====
Vikernes' trial began on 2 May 1994; he was represented by the lawyer [[Stein-Erik Mattsson]].<ref>Sortland, Kjersti, & Bjørn Reese. 1997. \"Greven\" opprørt. ''VG'' (13 April): 9.</ref> Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were put on trial around the same time. Some of them confessed to their crimes and implicated others. According to ''Lords of Chaos'', \"Vikernes is disgusted by the fact that, while he held fast to a code of silence, others confessed.\"<ref name=LoC141>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}}</ref>

During the trial the media made Vikernes \"the nation's first real bogeyman in fifty years\".<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=145}}</ref> At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn, and another friend had planned the murder. The court alleged that this third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi; to make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes' credit card.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=129}}</ref>

On 16 May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150&nbsp;kg of explosives.<ref name=\"Count Regrets Nothing\"/> Though Vikernes only confessed to the theft and storage of the explosives, two churches were set on fire the day he was sentenced, \"presumably as a statement of symbolic support\".<ref name=LoC141/> Blackthorn, who hadn't taken part in the murder as he had gone down the condominium's stairs to smoke, was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice.<ref name=LoC141/>

May 1994 also saw the release of Mayhem's album ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'', which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Campion |coauthors= |title=In the Face of Death |date=20 February 2005 |publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1419364,00.html |work=[[The Observer]] |pages= | accessdate=6 October 2007}}</ref> Before the release, Euronymous' family had asked Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said \"I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts, but I never did.\"<ref name=guardian/>

===Imprisonment===
Vikernes served his sentence at the prisons in Bergen, [[Tønsberg]], [[Ringerike Prison|Ringerike]], [[Trondheim Prison|Trondheim]], and [[Tromsø]].


According to Swedish scholar [[Matthias Gardell]] in his book ''[[Gods of the Blood]]'', Vikernes launched the [[Heathen Front|Norwegian Heathen Front]] (''Norsk Hedensk Front'') during his early years in prison.<ref name=\"gardell307\">{{harvnb|Gardell|2003|p=307|ps=, quote: \"Advocating national socialism, anti-Semitism, eugenics, and racist paganism, Vikernes launched Norsk Hedensk Front in 1993, which soon evolved into a network of independent tribes called the Allgermanische Heidnische Front (AHF)\"}}</ref> Gardell says this was a [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|pagan]] [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] group which grew into the international Pan-Germanic<!--This is the correct translation: Germanisch=Germanic, referring to the historic Germanic tribes, not to inhabitants of contemporary Germany--> Heathen Front (''Allgermanische Heidnische Front'' or AHF).<ref name=\"gardell307\"/> According to Xavier Cattarinich, Vikernes was the \"self-proclaimed leader\" of the Norwegian Heathen Front<ref name=\"XC319\">{{harvnb|Cattarinich|2000|p=319}}</ref> and Goodrick-Clarke mentions that Vikernes underlined \"his role as chieftain of his Norwegian Heathen Front\" with the writing of ''Vargsmål''.<ref name=\"GC205\">{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=205}}</ref> The Heathen Front officially denied that Vikernes was in charge. According to the authors of ''Lord of Chaos'', this may have been to protect him, as Norwegian prisoners were prohibited from leading political groups. In addition, the organization's listed address was the same PO box Vikernes used in prison, which the authors state would have made it \"very hard for him [Vikernes] to do an effective job\" at leading the organization, as all letters would have been screened by the prison personnel.<ref name=\"loc\">{{cite book |last1=Moynihan |first1=Michael J. |last2=Søderlind |first2=Didrik |authorlink1=Michael Jenkins Moynihan |authorlink2=Didrik Søderlind |title=Lords of chaos : the bloody rise of the satanic metal underground |date=2003 |publisher=Feral House |isbn=9781932595529 |page=177 |edition=New |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0xjCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA177#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref> Vikernes said \"I have never formed or been a member of such organizations. The only organization I am a member of is [[Riksmål Society|Riksmålsforbundet]]\" (''The Society for the Preservation of Traditional Standard Norwegian'').<ref name=\"Dagbladet.no\"/> 

On 8 April 1997, Norwegian police arrested five neo-Nazis in [[Hemnes]]. According to police, the young men were part of a self-styled \"[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe]]\" and were plotting attacks on political and religious figures in Norway. They also had plans to break Vikernes out of prison.<ref name=LOC362>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=362}}</ref> The group \"had all the trappings of a paramilitary unit\", including guns, explosives, bulletproof vests, steel helmets and balaclavas.<ref name=LOC362/> One of its members, Tom Eiternes, had befriended Vikernes in prison before escaping while on leave.<ref name=LOC362/> Vikernes' mother, Lene Bore, was arrested for supplying the group with 100,000 [[Norwegian krone|kroner]]. She confessed, but claimed she did not know they were \"right-wing extremists\" and said her son was being attacked by fellow inmates. In late 1996, his jaw had reportedly been broken in a fight with another inmate. However, the prison director said her claims were unfounded, and police suspected that the money came from Vikernes himself.<ref name=LOC362/> ''Lords of Chaos'' says that Vikernes adopted a \"[[White power skinhead|skinhead]]\" look and wore a belt buckle with SS insignia around this time.<ref name=LOC362/> Despite her confession, Bore was not convicted,<ref name=LOC362/> and in 1998 the case against the \"Einsatzgruppe\" was dropped.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=369}}</ref>

During his time in prison, Vikernes recorded two albums made up wholly of [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[neofolk]] music. The first, ''[[Dauði Baldrs]]'', was recorded in 1994–1995 and released in October 1997. The second, ''[[Hliðskjálf (album)|Hliðskjálf]]'', was recorded in 1998 and released in April 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intro.de/kuenstler/interviews/23043719/norwegischer-black-metal-als-die-kirchen-brannten |title=Norwegischer Black Metal |language=de |publisher=Intro.de |accessdate=20 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719050131/http://www.intro.de/kuenstler/interviews/23043719/norwegischer-black-metal-als-die-kirchen-brannten |archive-date=19 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Vikernes was denied access to an electric guitar, bass guitar or drums, and instead used a synthesizer. In 2000, Vikernes decided to put Burzum on hold. He believed that his philosophy was constantly misinterpreted by an ignorant fan base that was too closely related to black metal and Satanism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/lords_of_chaos_review.shtml |title=Varg Vikernes – A review of M.

In it, he wrote that he had received death threats and another inmate had tried to strangle him shortly after the newspaper article was published.<ref name=blabberoct27/> For his actions, thirteen months were added to Vikernes' sentence and he was moved to a prison in Ringerike. In July 2004, he was moved to a maximum-security prison in Trondheim. The last three years of his sentence were spent in [[Tromsø Prison]].

[[File:Varg Vikernes-3.jpg|thumb|Vikernes serving his last year in prison, 2009.]]

When Vikernes was convicted, it was possible to be released on parole after serving 12 years of a 21-year sentence, but in 2002, before he became eligible, the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] had extended this to 14 years. In June 2006, after serving 12 years, Vikernes was denied parole by the Department of Criminal Justice for this reason.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> His lawyer, [[John Christian Elden]], has complained that the policy change is a form of [[Ex post facto law|retroactive legislation]]. Article 97 of the Norwegian constitution forbids any law being given retroactive force. Vikernes was denied parole again in June 2008, although he was allowed to leave Tromsø Prison for short periods to visit his family. His full sentence would run for another seven years.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"Too dangerous for parole\">[[Aftenposten]], English edition, 11 June 2008:[http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2477398.ece Too dangerous for parole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804235049/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2477398.ece |date=4 August 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/news.shtml |title=Burzum and Varg Vikernes news and updates |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=20 August 2011}}</ref> In March 2009, however, his parole was announced.

===Life after prison===
Vikernes continued with Burzum after his release. He released a further three black metal albums: ''[[Belus (album)|Belus]]'' (2010), ''[[Fallen (Burzum album)|Fallen]]'' (2011) and ''[[Umskiptar]]'' (2012) and a compilation of re-recorded songs (''[[From the Depths of Darkness]]'').

In late 2019, Vikernes announced on his Twitter that he intended to release another album as Burzum.

==Writing==
[[File:Vargsmål.gif|thumb|right|''Vargsmål'', written by Vikernes in 1994]]

In late 1994, while in prison, Vikernes wrote a Norwegian-language book called ''Vargsmål'' (\"Varg's Speech\"<ref name=vargbooks/>). Vikernes has said he wrote ''Vargsmål'' to defend himself against the media. According to ''Lords of Chaos'', ''Vargsmål'' became available on the Internet for some time in 1996 but not in a printed form.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=159}}</ref> In 1997, a Norwegian publisher released a paperback edition of the book; its publication was financed by Vikernes' mother, Helene Bore.<ref name = \"hist\">{{cite book |last=Christe |first=Ian |title=Sound of the Beast: the Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Inc. |year=2003 |location=New York City |page=279 |url= |id= |isbn=}}</ref> As of 1999, ''Vargsmål'' was being sold by the neo-Nazi organization [[Heathen Front]] via its website.<ref name=ward/>

In 1998 he wrote a book called ''Germansk Mytologi og Verdensanskuelse'' (\"Teutonic Mythology and Worldview\").<ref name=vargbooks>{{cite web |last1=Vikernes |first1=Varg |title=A Comment To \"Vargsmål\" And Other Books By Varg Vikernes |url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_comment_to_vargsmal_and_other_books_by_varg_vikernes.shtml |website=Burzum.org |accessdate=22 March 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114043306/http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_comment_to_vargsmal_and_other_books_by_varg_vikernes.shtml |archivedate=14 January 2019}}</ref>

In 2011, Abstract Sounds Books published Vikernes' English book entitled ''Sorcery and Religion in Ancient Scandinavia'', about the religious practices of Scandinavian peoples, particularly during the [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Vikernes| first = Varg| title = Sorcery and Religion in Ancient Scandinavia| publisher = Abstract Sounds Books Ltd| edition = 1st| date = 5 December 2012| page = 6| isbn = 978-0-9566959-3-2}}</ref> According to a review from the music blog ''[[Heathen Harvest]]'', the book rejects accepted academic theories, instead focusing on Vikernes's speculation and personalized story-telling.<ref>{{cite web| last = Pomo| first = Brian| title = \"Sorcery and Religion in Ancient Scandinavia\" by Varg Vikernes| publisher = Heathen Harvest| date = 17 May 2012| url = http://heathenharvest.org/2012/05/17/sorcery-and-religion-in-ancient-scandinavia-by-varg-vikernes-3/| accessdate = 15 June 2012| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140812071043/http://heathenharvest.org/2012/05/17/sorcery-and-religion-in-ancient-scandinavia-by-varg-vikernes-3/| archive-date = 12 August 2014| url-status = dead}}</ref>

By late 2003, Vikernes had begun writing articles for Burzum.org, which became the official Burzum website.<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2010_interview_terrorizer.shtml Interview with Varg Vikernes for \"Terrorizer\" Magazine (#194, March 2010), by James Minton]. Burzum.org. Retrieved 4 April 2013.</ref> He also writes for his personal blog, Thulean Perspective, which was set up in January 2013. The website Ancestral Cult was created by him and his wife.

Vikernes has self-published a [[tabletop role-playing game]] named ''MYFAROG''. In 2019, he announced plans to release an ambient album of Burzum music, called 'Thulean Mysteries', intended as background music for the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.deathmetal.org/news/burzum-announces-new-album-thulean-mysteries/|title=Burzum Announces New Album Thulêan Mysteries|website=www.deathmetal.org|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref>

With three children, his mother was dependent on welfare for financial support. Kharbouch eventually found himself the primary breadwinner for the family.<ref name=fader/>

==Career==

===2002–10: Cocaine City Records===
French Montana began his career as a [[battle rap]]per in his teens under the name Young French. In 2002, French and close friend Cams created a series of street DVDs called ''Cocaine City'', drawing inspiration from the ''Smack'' DVD series popular at the time.<ref name=\"ComplexWIFM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/01/who-is-french-montana2|title=Who Is French Montana? |publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=January 2, 2012|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"IndieHipHop\">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiehiphop.net/how-they-came-up-the-french-montana-story/|title=How They Came Up: The French Montana Story|date=April 9, 2012|accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref> The series featured interviews with major and upcoming rappers, personalities, and a focus on street music and hip hop beefs.<ref name=fader/><ref name=\"ComplexWIFM\"/><ref name=\"RapFixLive\"/> Initially as Young French, he used the DVDs as a means of showcasing his talent as an underground artist, including in it his own original music, freestyles, and collaborations with other artists. The first volume in the series featured [[Pee Wee Kirkland]] and [[Remy Ma]] among others.<ref name=\"ComplexWIFM\"/><ref name=\"CombatJack1\"/> What started out as a medium for developing an audience, quickly grew into one of the top-selling street DVDs.<ref name=\"IndieHipHop\"/> The series ran for eight years between 2002–2010, totaling 14 volumes, and multiple spinoff films. Based out of the Bronx, French ran the series with the help of childhood friends including Brock, Droop Pop and Cheeze, who went on to become the first rappers that formed the Coke Boys.<ref name=\"HHVibeBrock\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hip-hopvibe.com/2012/08/22/hhv-exclusive-coke-boy-brock-talks-the-blackout-2-and-history-with-the-coke-boys/ |title=Coke Boy Brock talks \"The Blackout 2\" and history with the Coke Boys |date=August 22, 2012 |accessdate=August 16, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"HypeBrock\">{{cite web|url=http://thehypemagazine.com/2014/07/the-hype-magazine-interviews-cokeboy-brock/ |title=The Hype Magazine Interviews Cokeboy Brock |date=July 15, 2014 |accessdate=August 16, 2015}}</ref>

In 2003, French suffered a gunshot to the head when he was confronted by two armed gunmen as he was leaving a recording studio in the Bronx.<ref name=\"Life+Times\"/><ref name=\"USmag\"/><ref name=\"ComplexWIFM\"/> The incident resulted in one of the gunmen dead, in what is believed to be a case of \"[[friendly fire]]\" by one assailant against the other.<ref name=\"Life+Times\"/><ref name=\"CombatJack3\"/> French was then hospitalized for several weeks.<ref name=\"ComplexWIFM\"/><ref name=\"CombatJack3\"/> Upon discharge, he discovered that he was set up by someone close to him and his circle.<ref name=\"Life+Times\"/>

In 2007, French Montana released his debut mixtape ''French Revolution Vol. 1'', which included collaborations with [[Uncle Murda]], [[Jae Millz]], [[Mazaradi Fox]] and [[Tony Yayo]]. The track \"Quarter to Eight\" was the first of many collaborations with [[Rick Ross]]. The [[J.Cardim]]-produced \"Straight Cash\" was French's first underground hit. In 2008, he released his second mixtape, ''Live From Africa''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisis50.com/profiles/blogs/784568:BlogPost:3080689 |title=French Montana – \"Live From Africa\" |publisher=ThisIs50.com |date= April 29, 2008 |accessdate=February 22, 2016}}</ref> The song \"Waavvy\" was the first collaboration with rapper [[Max B]].

French Montana and Max B released their debut collaborative mixtape ''[[Coke Wave]]'' on February 6, 2009. A few weeks later, on February 23, Max B's mixtape ''Quarantine'' was released, while French released his ''The Laundry Man'' on February 24, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.datpiff.com/French-Montana-The-Laundry-Man-mixtape.35513.html |title=''French Montana – The Laundry Man'' |website=datpiff.com |date=February 24, 2009}}</ref> The two artists resumed concentrating on their solo records, until the release of their second collaborative mixtape ''Coke Wave 2'' in November that year.

French was included in [[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'s Freshman Class of 2012. At that time he had already been signed to [[Bad Boy Records]] following the success of his single \"Shot Caller\", and had just signed a joint-venture between Bad Boy and [[Maybach Music Group]].<ref name=\"RapFixLive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1680742/french-montana-xxl-freshman-cover.jhtml |title=French Montana Wasn't Gonna Do XXL Freshman Cover |publisher=MTV.com |date=March 8, 2012 |accessdate=January 7, 2013}}</ref>

====Harry Fraud and the Chinatown raid====
In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, close friend and producer [[Harry Fraud]] revealed first meeting French Montana during a recording session at a studio in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]].<ref name=\"HarryFraudRS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-old-fashioned-values-of-producer-harry-fraud-20131218|title=The Old-Fashioned Values of Producer Harry Fraud|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=December 18, 2013|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}</ref> Fraud recalls recording a song for someone which French happened to have a guest feature on. In an unusual turn of events, the building was [[police raid|raided]] by police after a tip-off that there were counterfeit Gucci and Louis Vuitton purses being manufactured at the same building.<ref name=\"HarryFraudRS\"/> Having lost his studio spot, Fraud went on to form his own studio in Brooklyn, where the two \"met and formed a bond\".<ref name=\"HarryFraudRS\"/>

Harry Fraud, who hails from a musical family background and had interned at a [[recording studio]],<ref name=\"HarryFraudL+T\">{{cite web|url=http://lifeandtimes.com/check-the-credits-harry-fraud-speaks-on-his-sound-producing-for-french-montana-new-label|title=Harry Fraud Speaks On His Sound, Producing For French Montana & New Label|publisher=Life+Times|date=August 25, 2013|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}</ref> was still unknown professionally at the time.

Upon its release, ''Excuse My French'' was met with mixed reviews from music critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/excuse-my-french/french-montana |title=Excuse My French Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=September 2, 2013}}</ref> It fared better commercially, debuting at number 4 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, with first-week sales of 56,000 copies in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.24121/title.hip-hop-album-sales-the-week-ending-5-26-2013|title=Hip Hop Album Sales: The Week Ending 5/26/2013|publisher=[[HipHopDX]] |accessdate=May 29, 2013}}</ref> The album also featured collaborations with [[Raekwon]], [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]], [[Ne-Yo]] and [[Jeremih]] among others.

Following the album release, French announced signing [[Chicago]]-based rapper [[Lil Durk]] to his Coke Boys.

In 2014, French collaborated with Diddy on Ross' track \"[[Nobody (Rick Ross song)|Nobody]]\" released on February 19. Rick Ross' remake of the late Notorious B.I.G.'s 1997 song \"[[Life After Death|You're Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You)]]\", featured an eerie chorus by French and interludes of Diddy in a live motivational rant. The song was inspired by Ross' brush against death the year before, when his [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce]] came under repeated gunshot fire while driving through [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]], on January 28, 2013.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/5922954/rick-ross-mastermind-s-death-defying-return-video-interview-photo-shoot-behind-the-scenes |title=Rick Ross Masterminds Death-Defying Return: Video Q&A + Photo Shoot Behind-The-Scenes |work= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=February 28, 2014 |accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref> In a bizarre series of events, French Montana would experience a similar but unrelated event months later when his convoy came under fire on March 1 in [[Philadelphia]] during his \"Excuse My French\" tour after French had finished performing a show hours earlier.<ref name=\"MTVphilly2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1702907/french-montana-philadelphia-shooting-statement/| title= French Montana Says He ‘Was Not Involved’ In Philadelphia Shooting|website=MTV.com/ |date=March 1, 2013 |accessdate= July 21, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"CBSphilly\">{{cite web|url=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/03/01/shooting-outside-rappers-tour-bus-leaves-1-dead-1-wounded/|title=Shooting Outside Rapper’s Tour Bus Leaves 1 Dead, 1 Wounded| website= Philadelphia.CBSlocal.com/ |date=March 1, 2013 |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}</ref> The music video premiered on February 27, 2014.

French Montana would collaborate with fellow-Bronx native [[Jennifer Lopez]] on her comeback single \"[[I Luh Ya Papi]]\". The song premiered on LA's [[Power 106]] in March 5, and was released as a single on March 11, with the music video coming out two days later. The single was an international hit, and among the most added/played tracks on [[rhythmic contemporary]] radio in Canada. French also appeared in the music video to Fat Joe's single \"Stressin\", featuring Jennifer Lopez, which premiered in October later that year. French joined Rick Ross on [[Puff Daddy]]'s comeback single \"Big Homie\" from his upcoming album ''MMM''. With a guest verse by Ross and ad-libs by French, the single was released on March 24, with the music video premiering on March 31. French Montana joined Ross, Meek and veteran [[Jay-Z]] on [[DJ Khaled]]'s summer hit \"[[They Don't Love You No More]]\". The single was released on March 29, with the music video coming out on June 22 that year.

On July 17, teasers to the movie ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]'' were released featuring music from French's upcoming single \"[[Don't Panic (French Montana song)|Don't Panic]]\". A month earlier, Instagram photos of the two showed French with then-girlfriend [[Khloé Kardashian]] on set with matching masks on, prompting speculation whether she was in the coming video. Following weeks of promotion, the single was released on August 12. The music video, which retained the dark themes of the movie while maintaining its catchy [[DJ Mustard]] character, became a viral hit. The couple had created bit of a stir two months earlier, on June 2, when Khloé posted an IG photo of the two on set of \"They Don't Love You No More\", depicting French holding a rifle in his arms with Khloé seated next to him with a bottle of liquor to her mouth. The remix to \"Don't Panic\", featuring Jeremih and Chris Brown, was released on October 14.

French Montana would join [[Remy Ma]] on DJ Khaled's \"They Don't Love You No More (Remix)\" released on August 2. Khaled's former [[Terror Squad (group)|Terror Squad]] affiliate and Bronx-native Remy Ma had just been released from prison the day prior. The three appeared together in the music video which premiered on August 23.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhJ96yluTTISPX27tX |title= DJ Khaled Feat. Remy Ma & French Montana – They Don't Love You No More Remix | date=August 23, 2014|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}</ref> This was her first musical comeback since her incarceration six years earlier. French collaborated with [[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]] on her second single \"[[Braveheart (Ashanti album)|Early In The Morning]]\" released on October 14 off of her comeback album, ''Braveheart''. This would be Ashanti's first album in six years.

French released his second single \"[[Bad Bitch]]\", featuring Jeremih, in December 2014, with the music video premiering on February 23, 2015. In late-October, French had announced his \"Set It Off\" tour with Jeremih, running up to his expected ''Mac & Cheese: The Album'' release in December. With the album eventually pushed back to next year; in its place, French released his collaborative [[extended play|EP]] with Harry Fraud, ''Mac & Cheese: The Appetizer'' on December 12, 2014.<ref name=\"FM18\">{{cite web|url=http://www.datpiff.com/French-Montana-Mac-Cheese-4-The-Appetizer-mixtape.671908.html |title= French Montana – Mac & Cheese: The Appetizer |website=datpiff.com |date=December 12, 2014}}</ref> His eighteenth mixtape, ''The Appetizer'' marked a shift away from French's usual feature-heavy records. With Fraud's signature sample-heavy production, French blurred the lines between rap and R&B in a manner not unlike that of Max B, and with subject matter ranging from difficult life-decisions, women, addiction and memories of his bygone friendship with his now-incarcerated rap soulmate. In August 2015, French paired with pop-opera artist [[Charisse Mills]] for the single \"Champagne.\"<ref name = allhiphop>{{cite web | url = http://allhiphop.com/2015/08/14/charisse-mills-ft-french-montana-champagne/ | title = Charisse Mills Ft.

'''SS ''France''''' was a [[Compagnie Générale Transatlantique]] (CGT, or French Line) [[ocean liner]], constructed by the [[Chantiers de l'Atlantique]] shipyard at [[Saint-Nazaire]], France, and put into service in February 1962. At the time of her construction in 1960, the {{convert|316|m|0|abbr=on}} vessel was the longest [[passenger ship]] ever built, a record that remained unchallenged until the construction of the {{convert|345|m|0|abbr=on}} {{RMS|Queen Mary 2}} in 2004.

''France'' was later purchased by [[Norwegian Cruise Line]] (NCL) in 1979, renamed '''SS ''Norway''''' and underwent significant modifications that better suited her for [[Cruising (maritime)|cruising]] duties. She was renamed '''SS ''Blue Lady''''' and sold to be scrapped in 2006, and scrapping was completed in late 2008.

==Characteristics==
''France'' was the French Line [[flagship]] from 1961 to 1974, combining regular five days/nights [[transatlantic crossing]]s with occasional winter cruises, as well as two world circumnavigations. During her last years, to save fuel costs, crossings took six days/nights.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

As ''Norway'' she was the flagship of the [[Norwegian Cruise Line]] from 1980 to approximately 2001.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Some, like ship historian [[John Maxtone-Graham]], believe that ''France'' was purposely built to serve as both a liner and a cruise ship, stating: \"Once again, the company had cruise conversion in mind... for cruises, all baffle doors segregating staircases from taboo decks were opened to permit free circulation throughout the vessel.\"<ref>Maxtone-Graham, John; ''Liners to the Sun''; Pg. 71</ref> However, others, such as ship historian William Miller, have asserted that ''France'' was the \"last purposely designed year-round transatlantic supership.\"<ref>Miller, William H.; ''Famous Ocean Liners''; Patrick Stephens Ltd.; 1987; Pg. 107</ref>

==History==

===Concept and construction===
''France'' was constructed to replace the line's other ageing ships like {{SS|Ile de France}} and [[SS Europa (1930)|SS ''Liberté'']], which were outdated by the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Without these vessels the French Line had no ability to compete against their rivals,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} most notably the [[Cunard Line|Cunard]] Line, which also had plans for constructing a new modern liner. It was rumoured that this ship would be a 75,000-ton replacement for their ships {{RMS|Queen Mary}} and {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}}.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} (This ship would eventually be the 68,000-ton ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]''.) Further, the [[United States Lines]] had put into service in 1952 {{SS|United States}}, which had broken all speed records on her maiden voyage, with an average speed of {{convert|35.59|kn}}.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

At first, the idea of two 35,000-ton running mates was considered to replace ''Ile de France'' and ''Liberté''. [[Charles de Gaulle]] (the future [[President of France]]) opined that it would be better for French national pride, then flagging due to the then ongoing [[Algerian War of Independence]], to construct one grand ocean liner, in the tradition of {{SS|Normandie}}, as an ocean-going showcase for France. The idea of such a publicly funded liner was controversial, leading to raucous debates in the French parliament. The dealing lasted three and a half years, and though the letter commissioning the construction was finally signed by the Chairman of the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, Jean Marie, on 25 July 1956, debate about the form, cost and construction schedule for ''France'' lasted a further year.<ref name=\"ARC\">Offrey, Charles; ''303 Arts, recherces et créations'':SS Normandie/SS France/SS Norway: ''France'', the Last French Passenger Liner; p. 45</ref>

Beyond the luxuries, the French Line had to also face the realities that transatlantic passenger trade was forecast to decline due to increased air travel. Also, costs to operate ships were increasing, mostly due to prices of crude oil.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  Thus, the new ship would be larger than ''Ile'', but smaller and cheaper to operate than ''Normandie''. She would also only be a two-class liner, which would, like the recently built {{SS|Rotterdam}}, be able to be converted from a segregated, class restricted crossing mode to a unified, classless cruising mode, thereby allowing the ship to be more versatile in its operations.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Despite these requirements, she was still to be the longest ship ever built, as well as one of the fastest, meaning not only an advanced propulsion system, but also a hull design which would withstand the rigours of the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] at high speed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Hull G19 was built by [[Chantiers de l'Atlantique]] shipyard, in [[Saint-Nazaire]], [[France]], her keel being laid down on 7 September 1957. She was built in a pioneering manner: rather than constructing a skeleton which was then covered in steel hull plating, large parts of the ship were [[Prefabrication|prefabricated]] in other cities (such as [[Orléans]], [[Le Havre]] and [[Lyon]]). The hull was fully welded, leading to weight savings, and two sets of stabilisers were fitted.<ref name=\"Offrey; p. 52\">Offrey; p. 52</ref>

She was blessed by the Bishop of [[Nantes]], Monseigneur Villepelet, and launched on 11 May 1960, at 4:15&nbsp;pm, by Madame [[Yvonne de Gaulle]], wife of the President, and was then named ''France'', in honour both of the country, and of the two previous CGT ships to bear the name. By 4:22&nbsp;pm ''France'' was afloat and under command of tugs.<ref>Offrey; p. 54</ref> President De Gaulle was also in attendance at the launch, and gave a patriotic speech, announcing that France had been given a new ''Normandie'', they were able to compete now with Cunard's ''Queens'', and the [[Blue Riband]] was within their reach.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} In reality, however, the {{convert|35|kn}} speed of ''United States'' would prove impossible to beat.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

After the launch, the propellers were installed (the entire process taking over three weeks), the distinctive funnels affixed to the upper decks, the superstructure completed, life boats placed in their davits, and the interiors fitted out. ''France'' then undertook her sea trials on 19 November 1961, and averaged an unexpected {{convert|35.21|kn}}. With the French Line satisfied, the ship was handed over, and undertook a trial cruise to the [[Canary Islands]] with a full complement of passengers and crew. During this short trip she met, at sea, ''Liberté'' which was on her way to the shipbreakers.<ref name=\"greatoceanliners\">[http://www.greatoceanliners.net/index2.html SS France (III)/Norway]</ref>

===Service history as ''France''===
''France's'' maiden voyage to [[New York City|New York]] took place on 3 February 1962, with many of France's film stars and aristocracy aboard.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

On 14 December 1962, ''France'' carried the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' from Le Havre to New York, where the painting was to embark on an American tour.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

[[File:France-ad1.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Poster advertising ''France<nowiki>'</nowiki>s'' 1965 [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's Eve|New Year's]] cruise to the [[West Africa]]n coast.]]
She sailed the North Atlantic run between [[Le Havre]] and New York for thirteen years. By the beginning of the 1970s jet travel was by far more popular than ship travel, and the cost of fuel was ever increasing. ''France'', which had always relied on subsidies from the French government, was forced to take advantage of these subsidies more and more.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Using the ship's versatile design to its full potential, the CGT began to send ''France'' on winter cruises, which was off-season for the Atlantic trade. One design flaw was revealed when the ship reached warmer waters: her two [[swimming pool]]s, one each for first and tourist class, were both indoors; the first class pool deep within the ship's hull, and the tourist class pool on an upper deck, but covered with an immovable glass dome. The latter, perhaps, was the more aggravating in hot weather.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} She also had limited outdoor deck space, with much of what was available protected behind thick glass wind-screens, useful on the North Atlantic, but frustrating when blocking cooling breezes in the tropics.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Nonetheless, ''France's'' cruises were popular, and her first world cruise took place in 1972. Too large to traverse the [[Panama Canal|Panama]] and [[Suez Canal]]s, she was forced to sail around [[Cape Horn]] and the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. That same year, with the destruction of the ''Seawise University'' (former [[RMS Queen Elizabeth|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']]) by fire in [[Hong Kong]], ''France'' became the largest in-service passenger ship in the world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Still, as the opening years of the decade progressed, the cruise market expanded, seeing the construction of smaller, purpose-built [[cruise ship]]s which could also [[Panamax|fit through the Panama Canal]]. Worse, in 1973 the [[1973 oil crisis|Oil Crisis]] hit, and the price of oil went from US$3 to $12 per barrel. When the French government, at the end of the [[Trente Glorieuses]], realized that keeping ''France'' running would necessitate an additional ten million dollars a year, it opted instead to subsidize the then in-development [[Concorde]]. Without this government money, the French Line could not operate, and with a press release issued in 1974 it was announced that ''France'' would be withdrawn from service on 25 October that year.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

At that, the crew decided to take matters into their own hands: an eastbound crossing on 6 September, her 202nd crossing, was delayed several hours while the crew met to decide whether to strike then and there, in New York, or six days later outside [[Le Havre]].  Le Havre won, and the ship was commandeered by a group of French [[trade union]]ists who anchored ''France'' in the entrance to the port, thereby blocking all incoming and outgoing traffic. The 1200 passengers aboard had to be ferried to shore on tenders, while approximately 800 of the crew remained aboard.

The strikers demanded that the ship be allowed to continue to serve, along with a 35% wage increase for themselves. Their mission failed, and the night of the takeover proved to be the ship's last day of service for the CGT. It took over a month for the stand-off to end, and by 7 December 1974, the ship was moored at a distant quay in Le Havre, known colloquially as ''quai de l'oubli'' - the pier of the forgotten.<ref name=\"greatoceanliners\"/><ref>[http://perso.orange.fr/paquebot.france-norway/histoire/HistoireIndexQ.html SS France: Quai de l'oubli]</ref>

By that time ''France'' had completed 377 crossings and 93 cruises (including 2 world cruises), carried a total of 588,024 passengers on trans-Atlantic crossings, and 113,862 passengers on cruises, and had sailed a total of 1,860,000 nautical miles.<ref name=\"captainsvoyage\">[http://www.captainsvoyage.com/norwegian-cruise-line/ss-norway/timeline.htmlSS Norway: Timeline]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===First decommissioning===

[[File:2016 05 01 Norway ex France verläßt Lloyd Werft nach Umbau zu Kreuzliner IMG 7098.jpg|thumb|''Norway'' leaving Lloyd shipyards in Bremerhaven after conversion.]]
The mothballing of ''France'' was met with dismay by much of the French population, resulting in a song by [[Michel Sardou]], titled ''Le France''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

The ship sat in the same spot for approximately four years, with the interiors, including all furniture, still completely intact. There were no plans to scrap the ship, or to sell it. In 1977 Saudi Arabian millionaire [[Akram Ojjeh]] expressed an interest in purchasing the vessel for use as a floating museum for antique French furniture and artworks, as well as a casino and hotel off the coast of the south-east United States. Though he purchased the ship for $24&nbsp;million, this proposal was never realised, and others were rumoured to have floated, including bids from the Soviet Union to use her as a hotel ship in the [[Black Sea]], and a proposal from China to turn her into a floating industrial trade fair.<ref name=\"greatoceanliners\"/>

In the end, the ship was sold in 1979 to Knut Kloster, the owner of [[Norwegian Caribbean Line]] for $18&nbsp;million for conversion into the world's largest cruise ship. Just before ''France'' was renamed ''Norway'' one last marriage was performed aboard the ship at the quay in Le Havre. The wedding was performed by Rev. Agnar Holme, the Norwegian Seaman's chaplain. Greg Tighe, Director of Research and Corporate Development for NCL, was married to Lorraine Anne Evering (Tighe) in ''France's'' chapel. Witnesses included the ship's Captain, and several members of NCL's management team. This marked the last marriage to be performed aboard ''France'', which had hosted hundreds of weddings over her [[transatlantic crossing|transatlantic]] career.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

By August of that year ''Norway'' was moved to the Lloyd shipyards in [[Bremerhaven]], Germany, where she would undergo renovations to the cost of $80&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://www.maritimematters.com/norway.html France Norway] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615090329/http://www.maritimematters.com/norway.html |date=15 June 2006 }}</ref>

===Service history as ''Norway''===
[[File:SS Norway (2).jpg|thumb|left|''Norway'' at [[Velsen]], the [[Netherlands]]]]

''Norway'' was registered in [[Oslo]], given the call sign LITA (literally meaning \"small\"), and was re-christened on 14 April 1980. She was the first (and only) purpose-built transatlantic ocean liner that was remodeled to be employed exclusively in luxury cruise service. Her hull form, bow design, and accommodation layout had been designed specifically for the rigors of crossing the North Atlantic, year-round. In her remodeling for cruise service, she was given a more generous accommodation, as well as larger and more numerous public spaces for the cruise-type recreations. Mechanically, the four screw propulsion plant was reduced to two screws. And in a bid for economy, she was given a complete set of bow/stern thrusters to give her the flexibility she needed to bring her into harbour; and, to dock, without resort to the expensive pilot and tugboat operations that were standard procedure in the heyday of the transatlantic express liners. When her re-fit was completed; and on her maiden call to Oslo, Senior Steward Wesley Samuels of [[Jamaica]], in the presence of King [[Olav V of Norway|Olav V]], hoisted the [[United Nations]] flag as a sign of the ship's international crew.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

She began her maiden voyage to [[Miami]] that same year, amidst speculation about her future in the cruise industry. ''France'' had been built as an ocean liner: for speed; long, narrow, with a deep draft, as well as an array of cabin shapes and sizes designed in a compact manner more for purpose travel than languid cruising. But ''Norway'' proved popular, and made the notion of the ship being a destination in itself credible. Her size, passenger capacity, and amenities revolutionized the cruise industry and started a building frenzy as competitors began to order larger ships.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

As cruise competition attempted to take some of ''Norway's'' brisk business, ''Norway'' herself was upgraded several times in order to maintain her position as the \"grande dame\" of the [[Caribbean]]. In September and October 1990, there was the addition of two decks atop her [[superstructure]], adding 135 new suites and luxury cabins. While many ship aficionados believe the new decks spoiled her original clean, classic lines, the new private veranda cabins on the added decks were instrumental in keeping ''Norway'' financially afloat during the later years of her operation, as these became a common feature throughout the cruise industry. She received additional refits in 1993 and 1996 in order to comply with the new SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) regulations.<ref name=\"ssmaritime.com\">[http://www.ssmaritime.com/SS-Norway.htm Norway Photo's by Raoul Fiegbig]</ref>

Competition eventually overtook ''Norway'', and she even started taking a back seat to other, newly-built ships in NCL's lineup itself. No longer the \"Ship amongst Ships\", NCL severely cut back on her maintenance and upkeep. She experienced several mechanical breakdowns, fires, incidents of illegal waste dumping, and safety violations for which she was detained at port pending repairs. Despite the cutbacks, the ship remained extremely popular among cruise enthusiasts, some of whom questioned the owner's actions in light of the continuing successful operation of ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'', which had become a well-maintained rival still operating 5-star luxury cruises and transatlantic crossings for [[Cunard Line|Cunard]]. In spite of this, the cutbacks continued and problems mounted even as the ship continued to sail with full occupancy. A turbocharger fire erupted on ''Norway'' as she entered [[Barcelona]] in 1999, which pulled her out of service for three weeks.<ref name=\"ssmaritime.com\"/> During one of the following cruises to Norway she broke down in [[Bergen]] with leaks to one of the propeller seals delaying sailing until repaired.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

[[File:SS Norway in Norway.jpg|thumb|''Norway'' in [[Flåm]] Norway 1999]]

Slated for retirement, ''Norway'' sailed out of [[Manhattan]]'s west side piers for the last time on 5 September 2001,<ref>[http://www.classicliners.net/SSNORWAY.html SS Norway]</ref> on yet another transatlantic crossing to [[Greenock]], [[Scotland]], and then on to her home port of Le Havre, France. Her passengers would learn of the [[11 September 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks]] on [[New York City|New York]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] six days later, while in mid-ocean.  As the cruise industry reeled from the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, her owners decided to place her back into service - operating bargain-basement cruises from [[Miami]], after a brief cosmetic refit that failed to address her mounting mechanical and infrastructure problems.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

On 25 May 2003, after docking in Miami at 5:00&nbsp;a.m., ''Norway'' was seriously damaged by a boiler explosion<ref name=\"transportation1\">[http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/fulltext/MAB0703.htm Norway Accident Investigation Report], [[National Transportation Safety Board]]</ref> at 6:37&nbsp;a.m. that killed eight crew members, and injured seventeen, as superheated steam flooded the boiler room, and blasted into crew quarters above through ruptured decking. None of the passengers were injured. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that \"the probable cause of the boiler rupture on the ''Norway'' was the deficient boiler operation, maintenance, and inspection practices\".<ref name=\"transportation1\"/> On 27 June 2003, NCL/Star decided to relocate ''Norway'', and she departed Miami under tow, although at first NCL/Star refused to announce her destination. She headed towards Europe and eventually arrived in Bremerhaven on 23 September 2003. NCL announced that constructing a new boiler was not possible but boiler parts were available to make the needed repairs. In Bremerhaven she was used as accommodation for NCL crew training to take their places on board the line's new [[Pride of America]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

====Former itineraries as ''Norway''====
NCL originally planned for ''Norway'' to sail empty from Germany to Miami, but a pre-inaugural cruise was added, with only a select number of passengers allowed to sail. Starting from [[Oslo]], Norway, stopping at [[Southampton]], England, and ending in New York City. A 6-day cruise to [[Bermuda]] was planned but cancelled at the last minute in favor of fixing some problems. She set sail on her first inaugural cruise from [[Miami]], [[Florida]], on 1 June 1980, a 7-day cruise with only two stops, one in [[Little San Salvador Island|Little San Salvador]] then followed by a stop in [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], [[USVI]]. The other days of the cruise were sea days as ''Norway'' was the destination itself. This remained her main itinerary from 1980 to 1982 until NCL announced [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], [[Bahamas]] was added. By 1985 [[St. Maarten]], [[Netherlands Antilles]] was added. In 1987 her new itinerary was introduced: a 7-day cruise from Miami stopping at St. Maarten, [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. John]], USVI; St. Thomas and Great Stirrup Cay. Her Western Caribbean cruises later introduced were 7-days stopping at [[Cozumel]], Mexico; [[Grand Cayman]], [[Cayman Islands]]; [[Roatan]] and NCL's private island Great Stirup Cay. Between regular cruising in the Caribbean and dry dock periods, she sailed many cruises to Western Mediterranean, Western Europe coast, Northern Europe, the British Isles and the Norwegian fjords.<ref name=\"classicliners.net\">[http://www.classicliners.net/SSNORWAY.html S.S. Norway]</ref><ref>[http://www.sealetter.com/Jun-01/nor0401.html Sealetter Cruise Ship Review: Norwegian Cruise Line's Norway]</ref>

Her official farewell cruise was a 17-day transatlantic cruise from Miami stopping at New York; [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]]; [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]; [[Greenock]], Scotland; [[Le Havre]], France and ending in Southampton. But a decision was made to keep ''Norway'' sailing bargain-based Caribbean cruises out of Miami. This continued until her demise in May 2003.<ref name=\"classicliners.net\"/>

===Second decommissioning===
[[File:ShipNorway.JPG|thumb|''Norway'' moored in Bremerhaven, Germany, February 2004]]
\"The ''Norway'' will never sail again,\" it was announced on 23 March 2004, by NCL Chief Executive Colin Veitch.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} The ship's ownership was transferred to NCL's parent company, [[Star Cruises]].

Due to large amounts of [[asbestos]] aboard the ship (mostly in machine and bulkhead areas), ''Norway'' was not allowed to leave Germany for any scrap yards due to the [[Basel Convention]]. After assuring the German authorities that ''Norway'' would go to Asia for repairs and further operation in Australia, she was allowed to leave port under tow. It was reported that the art from her two dining rooms, children's playroom, stairtower, and library were removed and placed in storage, to possibly be utilized on board a revitalized {{SS|United States}}, or another ship in the NCL fleet.<ref>[http://www.ss-norway.com/ Some Interior Elements Removed in Bremerhaven]</ref> Later photos of ''Norway'' at the scrapyards of [[Alang]], India, would prove this statement to be untrue. ''Norway'' left [[Bremerhaven]] under tow on 23 May 2005, and reached [[Port Klang]], [[Malaysia]] on 10 August 2005.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In fact, the ship was sold to an American naval demolition dealer for scrap value in December 2005. After eventually reselling the ship to a scrap yard, the ship was to be towed to India for demolition. In light of protests from [[Greenpeace]], potentially lengthy legal battles due to environmental concerns over the ship's breakup, and amidst charges of fraudulent declarations made by the company to obtain permission to leave Bremerhaven, her owners cancelled the sale contract, refunded the purchase price, and left the ship where she was.<ref>[http://www.ssmaritime.com/norway.htm SS Norway ex France] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901133443/http://www.ssmaritime.com/norway.htm |date=1 September 2009 }}</ref>

===''Blue Lady''===
''Norway'' was sold in April 2006 to Bridgend Shipping Limited of Monrovia, Liberia, and renamed ''Blue Lady'' in preparation for scrapping. One month later she was again sold, to Haryana Ship Demolition Pvt. Ltd., and was subsequently left anchored in waters off the Malaysian coast after the government of Bangladesh refused ''Blue Lady'' entry into their waters due to the onboard asbestos. Three weeks later, the ship began its journey towards Indian waters, though it was announced that she had left Malaysian waters for the [[United Arab Emirates]] for repairs and to take on new crew and supplies.<ref>[http://www.ssmaritime.com/newsupdates7.htm Letter of Pennisular Malaysia Marine Department, 19 May 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061117164028/http://www.ssmaritime.com/newsupdates7.htm |date=17 November 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?section=theuae&xfile=data/theuae/2006/june/theuae_june941.xml Khaleej Times: Did mystery ship owners lie over fate of SS Norway?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707224434/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?section=theuae&xfile=data%2Ftheuae%2F2006%2Fjune%2Ftheuae_june941.xml |date=7 July 2006 }}</ref>

Upon learning of the ship's destination, Gopal Krishna, an environmentalist and an anti-asbestos activist, filed an application before the Supreme Court of India to ensure that the ship, reportedly containing asbestos, complied with the Court's 14 October 2003 order which sought prior decontamination of ships in the country of export before they could be allowed entry into Indian waters. On 17 May 2006, Kalraj Mishra expressed his concern to the Indian Parliament over possible hazards ''Blue Lady'' presented, and requested that the government put a halt to the ship's entry. As the [[Supreme court of India|Indian Supreme Court]] had lifted any ban on the ship's entry, ''Blue Lady'' was anchored 100&nbsp;km off the Indian coast in mid-July, coming from [[Fujairah]], UAE.<ref>[http://www.ssmaritime.com/newsupdates.htm SS France/Norway Project Dubai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622164139/http://www.ssmaritime.com/newsupdates.htm |date=22 June 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?xfile=data/theuae/2006/June/theuae_June870.xml&section=theuae&col Khaleej Times: Dubai bid to save historic cruise liner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930212127/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?xfile=data%2Ftheuae%2F2006%2FJune%2Ftheuae_June870.xml&section=theuae&col |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>

This also cleared the way for her scrapping at [[Alang]], in [[Gujarat]], pending an inspection of the on-board asbestos by experts from the [[Gujarat Pollution Control Board]] (GPCB).<ref>[http://www.maritimematters.com/shipnews.html Maritime Matters Shipnews] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219132435/http://maritimematters.com/shipnews.html |date=19 February 2009 }}</ref>
After GPCB chairman, K.Z. Bhanujan, said the Board had constituted an experts' committee for inspection, ''Blue Lady'' was docked in [[Pipavav]], Kutch District. On 2 August 2006, after a five-day inspection, the experts declared the ship safe for beaching and dismantling in [[Alang]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/2/hi/south_asia/5237334.stm BBC: 'Toxic ship' cleared for breaking]</ref> This prompted a fury of controversy over the legality of such an act, including a press release from the NGO Platform on Shipbreaking that critiqued the technical report, alleging that the Technical Committee was under undue pressure to allow the ship to be beached, and had failed to follow the Basel Convention and the Supreme Court of India's order that ships must be decontaminated of hazardous substances such as PCBs and asbestos, and, in any case, must be fully inventoried and formally notified prior to arrival in the importing country.<ref>[http://www.ban.org/ban_news/2006/060803_irregularities_alleged.html Toxic Trade News; ''Irregularities alleged in the functioning of the Technical Committee on Blue Lady''; 3 August 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.ban.org/Library/NGO_Platform_Critique_on_TC_Inspection_Report_Final.pdf NGO Platform on Shipbreaking; ''Comments on the Indian Committee Inspection Report on the Hazardous Materials Onboard the SS Blue Lady''; 31 July 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806171505/http://www.ban.org/Library/NGO_Platform_Critique_on_TC_Inspection_Report_Final.pdf |date=6 August 2006 }}</ref> No such notification was made by either [[Malaysia]] (last country of departure) nor [[Germany]] (country where the ship became waste).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

The NGO Platform on Shipbreaking also announced that it was prepared to launch a global campaign against Star Cruises and their subsidiary Norwegian Cruise Lines for corporate negligence in this case.<ref>[http://www.ban.org/ban_news/2006/060726_cruise_line.html Toxic Trade News; ''Cruise Line Called on to Take Responsibility for Toxic Cruise Ship''; 26 July 2006]</ref>

[[File:SS France in its avatar of Blue Lady awaits the ship breakers at Alang, August, 2007.jpg|thumb|left|''Blue Lady'' at Alang, India, awaiting scrapping.]]
Photos from Alang revealed that ''Blue Lady'' was still partially afloat off the coast; her bow on dry beach at low tide, and the ship fully afloat at high tide. The photos also showed that neither NCL nor Star Cruises had removed any of the ship's onboard furniture or artworks (including the murals in the Windward Dining Room and Children's Playroom, and the [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] piano in Le Bistro), as had previously been reported.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Fans of ''France'' became concerned about the future of the art pieces, both due to the ship lying at anchor in a very humid environment without power for air conditioning, and due to lack of concern for preservation on the part of the scrappers.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1895897.cms ''The Times of India''; 'Blue Lady' gets ready for shipbreaking; 15 Aug 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.ssnorway.no/images.php the Last of SS Norway Web Auctions: Images] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022222037/http://www.ssnorway.no/images.php |date=22 October 2006 }}</ref> Still, it was stated that as of early September 2006, the ship's owner had signed contracts with various buyers, including auctioneers and a French museum, to sell the artworks. Other fittings were to be sold by the ton.<ref name=\"captainsvoyage\"/>

Gopal Krishna again moved an application seeking compliance with the Basel Convention, and three days later the Indian Supreme Court decided that the scrapping was to be postponed, stipulating that the Technical Committee, which earlier approved the scrapping, were to write a new report to be submitted before the Court's final decision.<ref>[http://www.vg.no/pub/vgart.hbs?artid=126919 Ege, Rune Thomas; VG Net; ''Her ligger hun på stranden''; 17 August 2006 (Article in Norwegian)]</ref> That decision was reached on 11 September 2007 (the 33rd anniversary of ''France's'' last day on the Atlantic), when the court ruled that ''Blue Lady'' was safe to scrap, a decision that was received negatively by environmentalists.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6988763.stm BBC News: ''Indian court clears 'toxic' ship''; 11 September 2007]</ref>

By 4 December of the same year, it was confirmed that the tip of ''Blue Lady's'' bow had been cut; a ceremonial move done to most ships that end up in Alang just prior to the full-scale breaking of a ship.<ref name=\"mm2\">[http://www.maritimematters.com/norway.html Maritime Matters: France, Norway] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725072713/http://www.maritimematters.com/norway.html |date=25 July 2009 }}</ref> It was confirmed on 20 January that ''Blue Lady'' had commenced scrapping.<ref name=\"mm2\" /> Scrapping began on the forward part of the sun deck.

By 12 July 2008 the bow and the stern of the ship had been removed, with little of the ship's famous profile still recognizable.<ref>[http://www.midshipcentury.com/ MidShipCentury]</ref> By September 2008, most of what remained above the waterline had been cut away, and the ship's demolition was essentially completed by late 2008.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

[[File:France Norway nez du paquebot.jpg|thumb|The bow exhibited in Paris, after having been sold by auction]]

==Design==

===Exterior===

====''France''====
{{noref-section|date=December 2018}}
When ''France'' was commissioned in 1956 the French Line asked for a ship which was to be the longest ever built, as well as one of the fastest. But beyond the technicalities, the ship was also to be a [[Ship of state#The ship of state since Plato|Ship of State]] – an ocean-going symbol of France – and thus had to be artfully designed. Her 316-meter (1,035&nbsp;ft) [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was designed with a traditional tumble-home, but with a flared stem line at the bow, which ended in a [[bulbous bow]] beneath the waterline, evoking similar lines on {{SS|Normandie|3=2}}. Also similar to ''Normandie'', ''France'' was equipped with a whaleback on her bow.

Deckhouses on France's [[Superstructure#Engineering concept|superstructure]] were built of aluminium, to reduce the ship's weight and thereby conserve fuel in operation. Within the superstructure a full-length outdoor [[promenade deck]] was designed into both sides of the Pont Canots. Unlike on many other ships, this deck did not wrap completely around the ship, being blocked at the forward end by cabins built in behind the bridgescreen.

One of ''France''{{'}}s most distinguishable features were her funnels, designed not only to be eye-catching but functional as well. They were constructed with two wings on the sides, each to lead the exhaust fumes outwards into the ship's [[slipstream]], where they would be caught by the wind and carried away from the passenger decks below. In addition, each stack had a device that filtered solids from the outlet, returned it into the depths of the ship and then disposed of it into the ocean.

Despite the modern appearance of ''France'', she was painted in the traditional CGT colours, used since the 19th century, of a black hull with red boot-topping and white superstructure, and funnels in red with black cap-bands.

The ship's exterior remained unchanged during her thirteen years of service.

====''Norway''====
[[File:SS Norway on \"maiden\" voyage.jpg|thumb|''Norway'' arriving at Southampton]]
In the conversion of ''France'' into a ship used for cruising, many alterations were made to her exterior decks.

Most notably, vast areas of deck space were opened up, and extended at the stern. A large [[lido]] deck was created at the very aft, built so wide, to accommodate as many sunbathing passengers as possible, that it cantilevered over the hull below, which narrowed in towards the stern at that point. The terrace off the First Class Smoking Room was lost in the construction of an outdoor buffet restaurant, and the Patio Provençal on the Sun Deck was filled in with a top-side [[swimming pool]]. This last addition created an odd space on ''Norway'', where a tunnel-like space remained around the tank of the pool, into which the original exterior windows and doors of the surrounding cabins, which once looked into the Patio Provençal, still opened, all in their original 1960s colours.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

[[File:SS Norway tenders1999.jpg|thumb|left|Tenders ''Little Norway I'' and ''Little Norway II'']]
On the [[forecastle]], behind the whaleback, the two cargo kingposts were removed and giant [[davit]]s were installed to hoist two two-deck, 11-knot [[Ship's tender|tenders]], built by Holen Mekaniske Verksted in Norway, and used to transfer passengers between ''Norway'' and island docks where the harbour would not allow for the ship's 9-meter (35&nbsp;ft) draft. Based on a [[World War 2]] [[landing craft]] design,<ref>{{cite web|title=SS Norway - little Norway|url=http://www.captainsvoyage.com/norwegian-cruise-line/ss-norway/ss-norway---little-norway.html|website=Captains Voyage|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref> these tenders were named ''Little Norway I'' and ''Little Norway II'', and were each themselves registered as ships, making ''Norway'' the only passenger ship in the world to carry ships. The two tenders were removed after the ship's retirement and moved to Norwegian's private island at [[Great Stirrup Cay]] in the [[Bahamas]]. Both vessels are still in service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tender to Great Stirrup Cay|url=https://boards.cruisecritic.co.uk/showthread.php?t=2227992|website=Cruie Critic|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref>

Below the waterline, the forward engine room was dismantled and the two outboard propellers were removed to reduce fuel consumption as a high service speed was no longer required as she was now a cruise ship.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Her operation was revived three further times, in 1990, 1997, and 2001, after machinery, decks, and recreational facilities were renovated. During her 1990 refit, two further decks were added to the top of her structure that featured luxury suites with private verandas. This addition raised her overall tonnage to 76,049 (winning her back the title of largest passenger ship in the world, from the 73,000-ton [[Sovereign of the Seas (cruise ship)|''Sovereign of the Seas'']]), her passenger capacity to 2,565, and gave her a competitive edge against newer ships being built at that time which featured more and more private balcony suites for their passengers. The addition of the decks was criticised by ship fans for making ''Norway'' appear top-heavy.<ref name=\"ssmaritime.com\"/>

===Interior===

====''France''====
''France''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> interiors were where the ship displayed its purpose as a showcase of modern French art and design. However, the interior designers were burdened with the pressure of living up to France's last great Ship of State, ''Normandie'', whose interiors had been on a scale never surpassed either before or since her construction. On top of this they had to work within the more strict fire regulations laid down after the end of [[World War II]], which gave them a limited palette consisting of few woods and much aluminium, Formica, and plastic veneers. This was very much like the interiors of {{SS|United States}}, put into service nearly ten years previous, and inspired the design of the public rooms on {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth 2}} eight years later.<ref name=\"greatoceanliners\"/> Also, fire regulations would not allow ''France'' to have the grand vistas that were constructed through ''Normandie's'' main First Class rooms. ''France's'' only double-height spaces were the theatre, First Class smoking room, and both First and Tourist Class dining rooms.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

One area given an unusual amount of attention was the ship's kitchens; 1,500 square meters in area, and placed almost amidships, between the two dining rooms which the one kitchen served. It was thought by the CGT directors that ''France'' would not only display the best in French art and design, but also French [[cuisine]]. The kitchens were equipped with the most advanced machinery available, as well as many traditional cooking aides, including a stove that was 12 meters long and 2.5 meters wide.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Staffed with 180 of ''France''<nowiki/>'s best cooks, sauce and pastry chefs, rotisserie cooks, head waiters and wine stewards, this team made ''France'' one of the finest restaurants in the world,<ref name=\"ARC1\">Siriex, Françoise and Conquer, Philippe; ''303 Arts, recherces et créations'': SS Normandie/SS France/SS Norway: The Interior Design of ''France''</ref> and the food on board prompted food critic [[Craig Claiborne]] to state ''France's'' Grille Room was the \"best French restaurant in the world.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

''France's'' dog kennels were located on the Sun Deck, and, as they served both European and American dogs, the run was installed with both a Parisian milestone and a New York City fire hydrant.<ref name=\"greatoceanliners\"/>

For First Class passengers, the Pont Veranda (Veranda Deck) held most of the public rooms. These included the Library and Reading Room, Smoking Room, Grand Salon, and balcony of the theatre, which was dedicated to First Class passengers only. These rooms were arranged down the centre of the ship, with large, glass-enclosed promenades to either side. The Library was a circular room with glass and lacquered aluminum enclosed book-cases all around, holding 2,200 editions, and was overseen by an attendant who regulated the borrowing and returning of books, as well as assisting passengers with their choices. The Grand Salon had a raised ceiling in the centre, over the abstract grey and white marble mosaic dance floor, with lower more intimate spaces at the corners. The theatre, which functioned both as a [[Proscenium]] (live theatre) and [[Movie theater|cinema]], sat 185 in the balcony, and 479 on the orchestra level, and had a projection booth which could handle 16, 35, and 70&nbsp;mm film. Until the 1990s it was the largest theatre ever constructed on a ship. However, one of the main showpieces of the First Class salons was the Smoking Room at the very aft of the Pont Veranda. Two stories high, with a raised section in the centre flanked by large columns, and double-height windows to port and starboard, the room was one of the most imposing aboard the ship.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

One level down was Pont Promenade, the main Tourist Class deck. The main lounges and rooms here were the Library, Smoking Room, Grand Salon, and orchestra level of the theatre. Like the Pont Veranda, Pont Promenade also had a glass-enclosed promenade along the port and starboard sides of the ship, though the windows did not run full height, nor were the spaces as long.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Pont A held both First Class and Tourist Class dining rooms. These rooms served as the gastronomic counterparts to the smoking rooms, in terms of importance, and thus of form and décor. The First Class Dining Room was located amidships, and spanned the full width of the ship, accommodating 400 passengers. The centre of the space rose to a circular dome, some 5.5&nbsp;m (18&nbsp;ft) high and, as on  ''Normandie'', passengers entered from one deck up (Pont Principale) and descended a grand, central staircase to the main dining room floor. Glassware, of which there was 4,800 wine and water glasses, was provided by Saint-Louis crystal factory, and tableware consisted of 22,000 china items, with 25,500 pieces of silverware. The Tourist Class Dining Room similarly was two decks high, but differed in that it had dining on the upper level, with only a well between the two floors, and no connecting staircase. It was placed aft of the kitchens, and sat 826 people. Next to the upper level of this dining room was the Children's Dining Room, which allowed both First and Second class parents to dine without the \"inconvenience\" of young children.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

After the first few of ''France's'' cruises, CGT executives realised that there was a problem regarding the naming of the public rooms. After her entrance into service, the rooms were simply known as the \"First Class Grand Salon,\" \"First Class Dining Room,\" \"Tourist Class Library,\" etc. However, during a cruise, where class barriers were withdrawn and all passengers were allowed to use all the spaces equally, it became a slight embarrassment for a passenger travelling in a large cabin to ask a steward for directions to the Tourist Class Dining Room. Hence, proper names were applied to each room to avoid the issue:{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

* First Class Salon - Salon Fontainebleau
* First Class Music Room - Salon Debussy
* First Class Card Room - Salon Monaco
* First Class Smoking Room - Salon Riviera
* First Class Dining Room - Salle à Manger Chambord
* Tourist Class Salon - Salon Saint Tropez
* Tourist Class Music Room - Salon Ravel
* Tourist Class Smoking Room - Cafe Rive Gauche
* Tourist Class Dining Room - Salle à Manger Versailles

Some anomalies that contravened the class lines were ''Bar de l'Atlantique'', essentially an after-hours club for drinking and dancing late into the night which was open to both First and Tourist Class passengers, the Tourist Children's' Playroom, and the Chapel, open as well to both classes, all of which were located on First Class Pont Veranda.<ref>[http://perso.orange.fr/paquebot.france-norway/visite/VisiteVirtuelle/PageVisiteVV13.html Bar de l'Atlantique]</ref><ref>[http://perso.orange.fr/paquebot.france-norway/visite/VisiteVirtuelle/PageVisiteVV21.html Salle de Jeux Enfants]</ref>

The décor of the rooms was regarded itself as art, with many notable French designers and artists commissioned to create the most striking spaces at sea. Beyond this, many pieces of artwork were especially ordered to adorn the walls of the dining rooms, lounges and cabins. Within the Salon Riviera the tapestry by Jean Picart le Doux dominated the entire forward wall, at 17.4&nbsp;m (57&nbsp;ft) long. In the same room two paintings by Roger Chapelain-Midy occupied niches in opposite corners to the aft. The overall interior was designed by Airbus, who had previously worked with Chapelain-Midy to design sets for a performance of [[Les Indes galantes]] at the [[Palais Garnier]] in 1952. Slightly forward, the Salon Fontainebleau was decorated by [[Maxime Old]], and within was contained three tapestries by Lucien Coutaud (''Les femmes fleurs''), two by Claude Idoux (''Jardin magique'', ''Fée Mirabelle'') and [[Camille Hilaire]] (''Sous-bois, Forêt de France''). Near to that room was the Salon Debussy (Music Room) with three bronze lacquered panels by Bobot, and a bronze abstract sculpture of a young woman playing a flute, by Hubert Yencesse. The theatre's interior was done in red, grey and gold by Peynet, with the ceiling in grey mosaic tile, and the port and starboard walls in vertical gold lacquered aluminium panels, tilted outwards to allow for recessed lighting from behind. The Chapel's interior was created by Anne Carlu Subes (daughter of [[Jacques Carlu]]) in silver anodized aluminium panels arranged in a 45-degree grid pattern. Jacques Noël created [[trompe-l'œil]] panels for all four walls of the First Class Children's Playroom in a [[Renaissance]] theme, and Jean A. Mercier painted a full mural entitled ''Une nouvelle arche de Noé'' (A New [[Noah's Arc]]) for the Tourist Class Children's' Playroom, using an abstract rendition of ''France'' as the Arc. The Bar de l'Atlantique contained two ceramics by [[Pablo Picasso]], as well three other ceramic sculptures (''Faune cavalier'', ''Portrait de Jacqueline'' and ''Joueur de flûte et danseuse'') by the artist in the Salon Saint-Tropez.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Lower down the dining rooms were fitted out with the intention that the rooms would be visual equivalents of the excellent food served within them. The Chambord dining room was decorated by Mrs. Darbois-Gaudin in gold [[Anodising|anodized]] aluminium, with monochrome chairs in red, orange and cream. The dome, painted black, contained an array of recessed spot-lights, and sat within a circular band of translucent, fluorescent-lit panels, all on a truncated rotunda of gold aluminium. Around all four walls of the room Jean Mandaroux's continuous mural, painted on 17 lacquered aluminium sheets, was entitled ''Les plaisirs de la vie'': The Pleasures of Life. Less sumptuous in design, the Versailles dining room was done by Marc Simon in tones of green, white and grey. The walls were produced from Polyrey and [[Formica]] with a [[decoupage]]d gold leaf abstract pattern. Only the forward wall held a mural done in 14 engraved glass panels by Max Ingrand, as well as two tapestries, ''Les amoureux du printemps'' by Marc Saint-Saëns, and ''Paysage provençal'' by Auvigné. Lowest in the ship, the walls of the First Class swimming pool were covered with back-lit engraved glass panels by Max Ingrand, and a ceramic sculptural fountain by Jean Mayodon sat at the forward end of the room.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

The First Class cabins also showcased design and art, especially in the Appartements de Grand Luxe. There were two aboard ''France'', amidships, on the port and starboard sides, on Pont Supérieur. Each had a salon, dining room, two bedrooms, and three bathrooms. The Appartement de Grand Luxe [[Île de France]] held a painting, ''La place de la Concorde'', by [[Bernard Lamotte]], as well as one, ''Parc de [[Gardens of Versailles|Versailles]]'', by [[Jean Carzou]], who also designed the suite's main salon. Slightly less expensive were the Appartements de Luxe, of which there were 12, as the Appartement de Luxe Flandres with a painting of [[Jean Dries]]. Each of these was decorated by artists, including the bathrooms where mosaic artwork adorned the walls around tubs and showers.<ref>[http://www.revedefrance.com/nouvellepage14.htm Les ponts et ses aménagements: Ses Intérieurs]</ref> Some of the mosaics were by the sculptor [[Jacques Zwobada]].<ref>Bernard Vasseur, ''Jacques Zwobada – L'œuvre dessiné'' (Paris: Éditions Cercle d'Art, 2008)</ref>

====''Norway''====
After the ship was purchased by Kloster in 1979 many of the original 1960s interiors were lost as rooms were either demolished within larger renovations, or redecorated to suit Caribbean cruising, under the direction of maritime architect Tage Wandborg and New York interior designer Angelo Donghia.<ref name=autogenerated3>Conquer, Philippe; ''303 Arts, recherces et créations'': SS Normandie/SS France/SS Norway: Love's Labours... Lost?</ref> Areas that were completely remodelled included all of the Tourist Class public rooms, and their indoor promenade areas were filled with prefabricated \"junior suite\" cabins. The former Versailles dining room, now the [[Leeward]], saw the least remodelling, the wall finish and etched glass mural remaining; however, carpeting and furniture was replaced, the open well was lined with [[smoked glass]] and aluminium handrails, an aluminium chandelier was placed over the two-storey space, and a spiral staircase was installed to connect the two levels. The former Salon Saint Tropez became ''Norway's'' North Cape Lounge for [[cabaret]] and other shows; the décor more dark and muted. Further forward on the same deck, the old Café Rive Gauche was transformed into the ship's [[Monte Carlo]] [[casino]]. With the promenade windows now within cabins, no daylight penetrated to the casino, and so all windows were filled in. The Tourist Class swimming pool, its glass dome gone after the construction of the open pool deck above, was filled with neon lights and covered with a glass dance floor as part of the remodelling of the entire space into the ship's Dazzles disco.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

However, most First Class rooms were left intact, save for the Salon Riviera and Salon Fontainebleau. The former was transformed into the Club International (dubbed Club-I by ''Norway'' aficionados), where every element of the original décor was removed. The square columns were made round with vertical aluminium fluting, the walls were repainted in a cream with baby-blue in the ceiling and wall niches, and all the original artwork and furniture was removed. In the corner niches oversized, crystal encrusted [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] statues were placed, and similar crystal garlanded busts sat on brackets on the forward bulkhead. Lounge seating, sofas and rattan chairs were placed amongst potted ferns, giving the room an overall [[Miami]] [[art-deco]] feel. Only the railings and bronze, star-shaped light fixtures were original to the room. The latter space was gutted and remade into Checkers Cabaret; a small show lounge with abstract chrome palm trees around the columns, red lacquered wall panels, and a black-and-white [[Draughts|checker board]] dance floor, again evoking a 1920s jazz club. The First Class Library remained untouched, and still used for the same purpose, while the Salon Debussy was turned into a shop, though its bronze décor and distinctive ceiling remained intact. To either side of these rooms ran the original First Class promenade decks, which were now turned into main circulation halls along the ship's principal public deck; the starboard dubbed [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] and the port as [[Champs-Élysées]], complete with columnar advertising posts similar to those found in [[Paris]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

===Main Propulsion===
''France'' was constructed by the CGT with speed and comfort in mind, and used the most advanced technology of the time in the design of the ship's propulsion system and other power generating machinery. Fuel costs were also an added factor.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Her engines consisted of eight high-pressure, super-heating boilers delivering {{convert|64|bar|psi}} of pressure and {{convert|500|°C|°F}}, all weighing 8,000 tons. This delivered {{convert|175000|hp|kW}} and provided for a service speed of {{convert|30|kn}} and a maximum speed of {{convert|35|kn}}, with a fuel consumption of 750 tonnes of oil in a 24-hour period. The machinery turning the four propellers was divided into two fore and aft groups, as was the electrical generating station.<ref name=\"Offrey; p. 52\"/>

When ''France'' was converted into ''Norway'', the speed for trans-Atlantic crossing was no longer needed, and so the forward boilers and engines were shut down and eventually dismantled. This move also reduced the fuel consumption to 250 tonnes per 24 hours. The remaining four boilers and engine room were made fully automated, and operated from either a central control station below decks, or from the bridge. Five bow and stern thrusters, developing 10,600&nbsp;hp, were also installed to increase manoeuvrability in ports without the assistance of tugs.<ref name=\"ARC1\" />

==Media appearance==

''France'', as one of the last transatlantic ocean liners before the [[Jet Age|jet age]], was also treated as the connection between, for example, New York and France. This was shown well in ''[[Le Gendarme à New York]]'' where the main characters sail on ''France''. The film also shows some of the 60s' interior of the ship.<ref name=\"youtube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4KXcLUvfAE|title=YouTube|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref> At the conclusion of the 1973 film ''[[Serpico]]'', the title character can be seen sitting on the dock with the vessel behind him, as he prepares to sail on her into exile after testifying against the [[New York Police Department]]. During the opening of ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'', also directed by Sidney Lumet, there is a shot of ''France'' docked in New York during the opening montage.

''France'' appears in the ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]'' episode \"The Werewolf\" as the cruise ship (on which the story takes place) at sea.

''France'' was also seen in the 2015 animated feature ''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]'' as the ship the three minions saw before entering [[New York City]] in 1968.

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' season 25 episode 12 \"Diggs\". The episode's Couch Gag featured an animation by [[Sylvain Chomet]]. A picture of ''France'' replaced the picture of the boat.<ref name=\"Chomet Couch Gag | Season 25 Ep. 12 \">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOi5OF7gAiM|title=YouTube|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=19 January 2017}}</ref>

In 1986, the American TV show, ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]'' spent a week-long cruise aboard ''Norway''.

''Norway'' appears in the 1989 María Sorté/Enrique Novi Mexican telenovela ''[[Mi Segunda Madre]]'' from episode 18 as the cruise ship (on which the romantic story takes place) at [[PortMiami]] and at sea.{{cn|date=March 2019}}

''Norway'' appears during the closing credits of the 1994 Sylvester Stallone/Sharon Stone feature ''[[The Specialist]]'' in a flyover of the Port of Miami.

The story in the [[Ric Hochet]] comic album ''[[Rapt sur le France]]'' takes place on ''France''.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 1994, the ship as then-owned by NCL as the ''Norway'', was featured in the children's show [[Real Wheels]] in the episode ''There Goes A Boat''.{{cn}}

On 30 July 1998, at the request of a passenger, the pilots of [[Proteus Airlines Flight 706]] made a slight detour from their intended route from [[Lyon]] to [[Lorient]] in [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]], to see ''Norway'' that was anchored in nearby [[Quiberon Bay]].  While circling the ship at a low altitude to give passengers a birds-eye view of the iconic former French vessel, the twin-engined [[Beechcraft 1900|Beechcraft 1900D]] was hit by a [[Cessna 177 Cardinal|Cessna 177]], causing both to crash into the bay and killing all 15 people aboard both aircraft.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nyti.ms/2bvV02U|title=World News Briefs: Air Collision Off France Kills 7, and 8 Are Lost|work=The New York Times|issue=Vol. 147 No. 51,235|agency=The Associated Press|publisher=New York Times Company|date=31 July 1998|page=A5}}</ref> The event was chronicled in the Canadian TV series, ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]'' season 16, episode 5: \"Deadly Detour\".

'''SS ''France''''' was a [[Compagnie Générale Transatlantique]] (CGT, or French Line) [[ocean liner]], constructed by the [[Chantiers de l'Atlantique]] shipyard at [[Saint-Nazaire]], France, and put into service in February 1962. At the time of her construction in 1960, the {{convert|316|m|0|abbr=on}} vessel was the longest [[passenger ship]] ever built, a record that remained unchallenged until the construction of the {{convert|345|m|0|abbr=on}} {{RMS|Queen Mary 2}} in 2004.

''France'' was later purchased by [[Norwegian Cruise Line]] (NCL) in 1979, renamed '''SS ''Norway''''' and underwent significant modifications that better suited her for [[Cruising (maritime)|cruising]] duties. She was renamed '''SS ''Blue Lady''''' and sold to be scrapped in 2006, and scrapping was completed in late 2008.

==Characteristics==
''France'' was the French Line [[flagship]] from 1961 to 1974, combining regular five days/nights [[transatlantic crossing]]s with occasional winter cruises, as well as two world circumnavigations. During her last years, to save fuel costs, crossings took six days/nights.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

As ''Norway'' she was the flagship of the [[Norwegian Cruise Line]] from 1980 to approximately 2001.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Some, like ship historian [[John Maxtone-Graham]], believe that ''France'' was purposely built to serve as both a liner and a cruise ship, stating: \"Once again, the company had cruise conversion in mind... for cruises, all baffle doors segregating staircases from taboo decks were opened to permit free circulation throughout the vessel.\"<ref>Maxtone-Graham, John; ''Liners to the Sun''; Pg. 71</ref> However, others, such as ship historian William Miller, have asserted that ''France'' was the \"last purposely designed year-round transatlantic supership.\"<ref>Miller, William H.; ''Famous Ocean Liners''; Patrick Stephens Ltd.; 1987; Pg. 107</ref>

==History==

===Concept and construction===
''France'' was constructed to replace the line's other ageing ships like {{SS|Ile de France}} and [[SS Europa (1930)|SS ''Liberté'']], which were outdated by the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Without these vessels the French Line had no ability to compete against their rivals,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} most notably the [[Cunard Line|Cunard]] Line, which also had plans for constructing a new modern liner. It was rumoured that this ship would be a 75,000-ton replacement for their ships {{RMS|Queen Mary}} and {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}}.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} (This ship would eventually be the 68,000-ton ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]''.) Further, the [[United States Lines]] had put into service in 1952 {{SS|United States}}, which had broken all speed records on her maiden voyage, with an average speed of {{convert|35.59|kn}}.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

At first, the idea of two 35,000-ton running mates was considered to replace ''Ile de France'' and ''Liberté''. [[Charles de Gaulle]] (the future [[President of France]]) opined that it would be better for French national pride, then flagging due to the then ongoing [[Algerian War of Independence]], to construct one grand ocean liner, in the tradition of {{SS|Normandie}}, as an ocean-going showcase for France. The idea of such a publicly funded liner was controversial, leading to raucous debates in the French parliament. The dealing lasted three and a half years, and though the letter commissioning the construction was finally signed by the Chairman of the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, Jean Marie, on 25 July 1956, debate about the form, cost and construction schedule for ''France'' lasted a further year.<ref name=\"ARC\">Offrey, Charles; ''303 Arts, recherces et créations'':SS Normandie/SS France/SS Norway: ''France'', the Last French Passenger Liner; p. 45</ref>

Beyond the luxuries, the French Line had to also face the realities that transatlantic passenger trade was forecast to decline due to increased air travel. Also, costs to operate ships were increasing, mostly due to prices of crude oil.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  Thus, the new ship would be larger than ''Ile'', but smaller and cheaper to operate than ''Normandie''. She would also only be a two-class liner, which would, like the recently built {{SS|Rotterdam}}, be able to be converted from a segregated, class restricted crossing mode to a unified, classless cruising mode, thereby allowing the ship to be more versatile in its operations.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Despite these requirements, she was still to be the longest ship ever built, as well as one of the fastest, meaning not only an advanced propulsion system, but also a hull design which would withstand the rigours of the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] at high speed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Hull G19 was built by [[Chantiers de l'Atlantique]] shipyard, in [[Saint-Nazaire]], [[France]], her keel being laid down on 7 September 1957. She was built in a pioneering manner: rather than constructing a skeleton which was then covered in steel hull plating, large parts of the ship were [[Prefabrication|prefabricated]] in other cities (such as [[Orléans]], [[Le Havre]] and [[Lyon]]). The hull was fully welded, leading to weight savings, and two sets of stabilisers were fitted.<ref name=\"Offrey; p. 52\">Offrey; p. 52</ref>

She was blessed by the Bishop of [[Nantes]], Monseigneur Villepelet, and launched on 11 May 1960, at 4:15&nbsp;pm, by Madame [[Yvonne de Gaulle]], wife of the President, and was then named ''France'', in honour both of the country, and of the two previous CGT ships to bear the name. By 4:22&nbsp;pm ''France'' was afloat and under command of tugs.<ref>Offrey; p. 54</ref> President De Gaulle was also in attendance at the launch, and gave a patriotic speech, announcing that France had been given a new ''Normandie'', they were able to compete now with Cunard's ''Queens'', and the [[Blue Riband]] was within their reach.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} In reality, however, the {{convert|35|kn}} speed of ''United States'' would prove impossible to beat.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

After the launch, the propellers were installed (the entire process taking over three weeks), the distinctive funnels affixed to the upper decks, the superstructure completed, life boats placed in their davits, and the interiors fitted out. ''France'' then undertook her sea trials on 19 November 1961, and averaged an unexpected {{convert|35.21|kn}}. With the French Line satisfied, the ship was handed over, and undertook a trial cruise to the [[Canary Islands]] with a full complement of passengers and crew. During this short trip she met, at sea, ''Liberté'' which was on her way to the shipbreakers.<ref name=\"greatoceanliners\">[http://www.greatoceanliners.net/index2.html SS France (III)/Norway]</ref>

===Service history as ''France''===
''France's'' maiden voyage to [[New York City|New York]] took place on 3 February 1962, with many of France's film stars and aristocracy aboard.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

On 14 December 1962, ''France'' carried the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' from Le Havre to New York, where the painting was to embark on an American tour.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

[[File:France-ad1.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Poster advertising ''France<nowiki>'</nowiki>s'' 1965 [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's Eve|New Year's]] cruise to the [[West Africa]]n coast.]]
She sailed the North Atlantic run between [[Le Havre]] and New York for thirteen years. By the beginning of the 1970s jet travel was by far more popular than ship travel, and the cost of fuel was ever increasing. ''France'', which had always relied on subsidies from the French government, was forced to take advantage of these subsidies more and more.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Using the ship's versatile design to its full potential, the CGT began to send ''France'' on winter cruises, which was off-season for the Atlantic trade. One design flaw was revealed when the ship reached warmer waters: her two [[swimming pool]]s, one each for first and tourist class, were both indoors; the first class pool deep within the ship's hull, and the tourist class pool on an upper deck, but covered with an immovable glass dome. The latter, perhaps, was the more aggravating in hot weather.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} She also had limited outdoor deck space, with much of what was available protected behind thick glass wind-screens, useful on the North Atlantic, but frustrating when blocking cooling breezes in the tropics.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Nonetheless, ''France's'' cruises were popular, and her first world cruise took place in 1972. Too large to traverse the [[Panama Canal|Panama]] and [[Suez Canal]]s, she was forced to sail around [[Cape Horn]] and the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. That same year, with the destruction of the ''Seawise University'' (former [[RMS Queen Elizabeth|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']]) by fire in [[Hong Kong]], ''France'' became the largest in-service passenger ship in the world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Still, as the opening years of the decade progressed, the cruise market expanded, seeing the construction of smaller, purpose-built [[cruise ship]]s which could also [[Panamax|fit through the Panama Canal]]. Worse, in 1973 the [[1973 oil crisis|Oil Crisis]] hit, and the price of oil went from US$3 to $12 per barrel. When the French government, at the end of the [[Trente Glorieuses]], realized that keeping ''France'' running would necessitate an additional ten million dollars a year, it opted instead to subsidize the then in-development [[Concorde]]. Without this government money, the French Line could not operate, and with a press release issued in 1974 it was announced that ''France'' would be withdrawn from service on 25 October that year.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

At that, the crew decided to take matters into their own hands: an eastbound crossing on 6 September, her 202nd crossing, was delayed several hours while the crew met to decide whether to strike then and there, in New York, or six days later outside [[Le Havre]].  Le Havre won, and the ship was commandeered by a group of French [[trade union]]ists who anchored ''France'' in the entrance to the port, thereby blocking all incoming and outgoing traffic. The 1200 passengers aboard had to be ferried to shore on tenders, while approximately 800 of the crew remained aboard.

The strikers demanded that the ship be allowed to continue to serve, along with a 35% wage increase for themselves. Their mission failed, and the night of the takeover proved to be the ship's last day of service for the CGT. It took over a month for the stand-off to end, and by 7 December 1974, the ship was moored at a distant quay in Le Havre, known colloquially as ''quai de l'oubli'' - the pier of the forgotten.<ref name=\"greatoceanliners\"/><ref>[http://perso.orange.fr/paquebot.france-norway/histoire/HistoireIndexQ.html SS France: Quai de l'oubli]</ref>

By that time ''France'' had completed 377 crossings and 93 cruises (including 2 world cruises), carried a total of 588,024 passengers on trans-Atlantic crossings, and 113,862 passengers on cruises, and had sailed a total of 1,860,000 nautical miles.<ref name=\"captainsvoyage\">[http://www.captainsvoyage.com/norwegian-cruise-line/ss-norway/timeline.htmlSS Norway: Timeline]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===First decommissioning===

[[File:2016 05 01 Norway ex France verläßt Lloyd Werft nach Umbau zu Kreuzliner IMG 7098.jpg|thumb|''Norway'' leaving Lloyd shipyards in Bremerhaven after conversion.]]
The mothballing of ''France'' was met with dismay by much of the French population, resulting in a song by [[Michel Sardou]], titled ''Le France''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

The ship sat in the same spot for approximately four years, with the interiors, including all furniture, still completely intact. There were no plans to scrap the ship, or to sell it. In 1977 Saudi Arabian millionaire [[Akram Ojjeh]] expressed an interest in purchasing the vessel for use as a floating museum for antique French furniture and artworks, as well as a casino and hotel off the coast of the south-east United States. Though he purchased the ship for $24&nbsp;million, this proposal was never realised, and others were rumoured to have floated, including bids from the Soviet Union to use her as a hotel ship in the [[Black Sea]], and a proposal from China to turn her into a floating industrial trade fair.<ref name=\"greatoceanliners\"/>

In the end, the ship was sold in 1979 to Knut Kloster, the owner of [[Norwegian Caribbean Line]] for $18&nbsp;million for conversion into the world's largest cruise ship. Just before ''France'' was renamed ''Norway'' one last marriage was performed aboard the ship at the quay in Le Havre. The wedding was performed by Rev. Agnar Holme, the Norwegian Seaman's chaplain. Greg Tighe, Director of Research and Corporate Development for NCL, was married to Lorraine Anne Evering (Tighe) in ''France's'' chapel. Witnesses included the ship's Captain, and several members of NCL's management team. This marked the last marriage to be performed aboard ''France'', which had hosted hundreds of weddings over her [[transatlantic crossing|transatlantic]] career.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

By August of that year ''Norway'' was moved to the Lloyd shipyards in [[Bremerhaven]], Germany, where she would undergo renovations to the cost of $80&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://www.maritimematters.com/norway.html France Norway] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615090329/http://www.maritimematters.com/norway.html |date=15 June 2006 }}</ref>

===Service history as ''Norway''===
[[File:SS Norway (2).jpg|thumb|left|''Norway'' at [[Velsen]], the [[Netherlands]]]]

''Norway'' was registered in [[Oslo]], given the call sign LITA (literally meaning \"small\"), and was re-christened on 14 April 1980. She was the first (and only) purpose-built transatlantic ocean liner that was remodeled to be employed exclusively in luxury cruise service. Her hull form, bow design, and accommodation layout had been designed specifically for the rigors of crossing the North Atlantic, year-round. In her remodeling for cruise service, she was given a more generous accommodation, as well as larger and more numerous public spaces for the cruise-type recreations. Mechanically, the four screw propulsion plant was reduced to two screws. And in a bid for economy, she was given a complete set of bow/stern thrusters to give her the flexibility she needed to bring her into harbour; and, to dock, without resort to the expensive pilot and tugboat operations that were standard procedure in the heyday of the transatlantic express liners. When her re-fit was completed; and on her maiden call to Oslo, Senior Steward Wesley Samuels of [[Jamaica]], in the presence of King [[Olav V of Norway|Olav V]], hoisted the [[United Nations]] flag as a sign of the ship's international crew.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

She began her maiden voyage to [[Miami]] that same year, amidst speculation about her future in the cruise industry. ''France'' had been built as an ocean liner: for speed; long, narrow, with a deep draft, as well as an array of cabin shapes and sizes designed in a compact manner more for purpose travel than languid cruising. But ''Norway'' proved popular, and made the notion of the ship being a destination in itself credible. Her size, passenger capacity, and amenities revolutionized the cruise industry and started a building frenzy as competitors began to order larger ships.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

As cruise competition attempted to take some of ''Norway's'' brisk business, ''Norway'' herself was upgraded several times in order to maintain her position as the \"grande dame\" of the [[Caribbean]]. In September and October 1990, there was the addition of two decks atop her [[superstructure]], adding 135 new suites and luxury cabins. While many ship aficionados believe the new decks spoiled her original clean, classic lines, the new private veranda cabins on the added decks were instrumental in keeping ''Norway'' financially afloat during the later years of her operation, as these became a common feature throughout the cruise industry. She received additional refits in 1993 and 1996 in order to comply with the new SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) regulations.<ref name=\"ssmaritime.com\">[http://www.ssmaritime.com/SS-Norway.htm Norway Photo's by Raoul Fiegbig]</ref>

Competition eventually overtook ''Norway'', and she even started taking a back seat to other, newly-built ships in NCL's lineup itself. No longer the \"Ship amongst Ships\", NCL severely cut back on her maintenance and upkeep. She experienced several mechanical breakdowns, fires, incidents of illegal waste dumping, and safety violations for which she was detained at port pending repairs. Despite the cutbacks, the ship remained extremely popular among cruise enthusiasts, some of whom questioned the owner's actions in light of the continuing successful operation of ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'', which had become a well-maintained rival still operating 5-star luxury cruises and transatlantic crossings for [[Cunard Line|Cunard]]. In spite of this, the cutbacks continued and problems mounted even as the ship continued to sail with full occupancy. A turbocharger fire erupted on ''Norway'' as she entered [[Barcelona]] in 1999, which pulled her out of service for three weeks.<ref name=\"ssmaritime.com\"/> During one of the following cruises to Norway she broke down in [[Bergen]] with leaks to one of the propeller seals delaying sailing until repaired.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

[[File:SS Norway in Norway.jpg|thumb|''Norway'' in [[Flåm]] Norway 1999]]

Slated for retirement, ''Norway'' sailed out of [[Manhattan]]'s west side piers for the last time on 5 September 2001,<ref>[http://www.classicliners.net/SSNORWAY.html SS Norway]</ref> on yet another transatlantic crossing to [[Greenock]], [[Scotland]], and then on to her home port of Le Havre, France. Her passengers would learn of the [[11 September 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks]] on [[New York City|New York]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] six days later, while in mid-ocean.  As the cruise industry reeled from the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, her owners decided to place her back into service - operating bargain-basement cruises from [[Miami]], after a brief cosmetic refit that failed to address her mounting mechanical and infrastructure problems.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

On 25 May 2003, after docking in Miami at 5:00&nbsp;a.m., ''Norway'' was seriously damaged by a boiler explosion<ref name=\"transportation1\">[http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/fulltext/MAB0703.htm Norway Accident Investigation Report], [[National Transportation Safety Board]]</ref> at 6:37&nbsp;a.m. that killed eight crew members, and injured seventeen, as superheated steam flooded the boiler room, and blasted into crew quarters above through ruptured decking. None of the passengers were injured. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that \"the probable cause of the boiler rupture on the ''Norway'' was the deficient boiler operation, maintenance, and inspection practices\".<ref name=\"transportation1\"/> On 27 June 2003, NCL/Star decided to relocate ''Norway'', and she departed Miami under tow, although at first NCL/Star refused to announce her destination. She headed towards Europe and eventually arrived in Bremerhaven on 23 September 2003. NCL announced that constructing a new boiler was not possible but boiler parts were available to make the needed repairs. In Bremerhaven she was used as accommodation for NCL crew training to take their places on board the line's new [[Pride of America]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

====Former itineraries as ''Norway''====
NCL originally planned for ''Norway'' to sail empty from Germany to Miami, but a pre-inaugural cruise was added, with only a select number of passengers allowed to sail. Starting from [[Oslo]], Norway, stopping at [[Southampton]], England, and ending in New York City. A 6-day cruise to [[Bermuda]] was planned but cancelled at the last minute in favor of fixing some problems. She set sail on her first inaugural cruise from [[Miami]], [[Florida]], on 1 June 1980, a 7-day cruise with only two stops, one in [[Little San Salvador Island|Little San Salvador]] then followed by a stop in [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], [[USVI]]. The other days of the cruise were sea days as ''Norway'' was the destination itself. This remained her main itinerary from 1980 to 1982 until NCL announced [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], [[Bahamas]] was added. By 1985 [[St. Maarten]], [[Netherlands Antilles]] was added. In 1987 her new itinerary was introduced: a 7-day cruise from Miami stopping at St. Maarten, [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. John]], USVI; St. Thomas and Great Stirrup Cay. Her Western Caribbean cruises later introduced were 7-days stopping at [[Cozumel]], Mexico; [[Grand Cayman]], [[Cayman Islands]]; [[Roatan]] and NCL's private island Great Stirup Cay. Between regular cruising in the Caribbean and dry dock periods, she sailed many cruises to Western Mediterranean, Western Europe coast, Northern Europe, the British Isles and the Norwegian fjords.<ref name=\"classicliners.net\">[http://www.classicliners.net/SSNORWAY.html S.S. Norway]</ref><ref>[http://www.sealetter.com/Jun-01/nor0401.html Sealetter Cruise Ship Review: Norwegian Cruise Line's Norway]</ref>

Her official farewell cruise was a 17-day transatlantic cruise from Miami stopping at New York; [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]]; [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]; [[Greenock]], Scotland; [[Le Havre]], France and ending in Southampton. But a decision was made to keep ''Norway'' sailing bargain-based Caribbean cruises out of Miami. This continued until her demise in May 2003.<ref name=\"classicliners.net\"/>

===Second decommissioning===
[[File:ShipNorway.JPG|thumb|''Norway'' moored in Bremerhaven, Germany, February 2004]]
\"The ''Norway'' will never sail again,\" it was announced on 23 March 2004, by NCL Chief Executive Colin Veitch.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} The ship's ownership was transferred to NCL's parent company, [[Star Cruises]].

Due to large amounts of [[asbestos]] aboard the ship (mostly in machine and bulkhead areas), ''Norway'' was not allowed to leave Germany for any scrap yards due to the [[Basel Convention]]. After assuring the German authorities that ''Norway'' would go to Asia for repairs and further operation in Australia, she was allowed to leave port under tow. It was reported that the art from her two dining rooms, children's playroom, stairtower, and library were removed and placed in storage, to possibly be utilized on board a revitalized {{SS|United States}}, or another ship in the NCL fleet.<ref>[http://www.ss-norway.com/ Some Interior Elements Removed in Bremerhaven]</ref> Later photos of ''Norway'' at the scrapyards of [[Alang]], India, would prove this statement to be untrue. ''Norway'' left [[Bremerhaven]] under tow on 23 May 2005, and reached [[Port Klang]], [[Malaysia]] on 10 August 2005.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In fact, the ship was sold to an American naval demolition dealer for scrap value in December 2005. After eventually reselling the ship to a scrap yard, the ship was to be towed to India for demolition. In light of protests from [[Greenpeace]], potentially lengthy legal battles due to environmental concerns over the ship's breakup, and amidst charges of fraudulent declarations made by the company to obtain permission to leave Bremerhaven, her owners cancelled the sale contract, refunded the purchase price, and left the ship where she was.<ref>[http://www.ssmaritime.com/norway.htm SS Norway ex France] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901133443/http://www.ssmaritime.com/norway.htm |date=1 September 2009 }}</ref>

===''Blue Lady''===
''Norway'' was sold in April 2006 to Bridgend Shipping Limited of Monrovia, Liberia, and renamed ''Blue Lady'' in preparation for scrapping. One month later she was again sold, to Haryana Ship Demolition Pvt. Ltd., and was subsequently left anchored in waters off the Malaysian coast after the government of Bangladesh refused ''Blue Lady'' entry into their waters due to the onboard asbestos. Three weeks later, the ship began its journey towards Indian waters, though it was announced that she had left Malaysian waters for the [[United Arab Emirates]] for repairs and to take on new crew and supplies.<ref>[http://www.ssmaritime.com/newsupdates7.htm Letter of Pennisular Malaysia Marine Department, 19 May 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061117164028/http://www.ssmaritime.com/newsupdates7.htm |date=17 November 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?section=theuae&xfile=data/theuae/2006/june/theuae_june941.xml Khaleej Times: Did mystery ship owners lie over fate of SS Norway?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707224434/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?section=theuae&xfile=data%2Ftheuae%2F2006%2Fjune%2Ftheuae_june941.xml |date=7 July 2006 }}</ref>

Upon learning of the ship's destination, Gopal Krishna, an environmentalist and an anti-asbestos activist, filed an application before the Supreme Court of India to ensure that the ship, reportedly containing asbestos, complied with the Court's 14 October 2003 order which sought prior decontamination of ships in the country of export before they could be allowed entry into Indian waters. On 17 May 2006, Kalraj Mishra expressed his concern to the Indian Parliament over possible hazards ''Blue Lady'' presented, and requested that the government put a halt to the ship's entry. As the [[Supreme court of India|Indian Supreme Court]] had lifted any ban on the ship's entry, ''Blue Lady'' was anchored 100&nbsp;km off the Indian coast in mid-July, coming from [[Fujairah]], UAE.<ref>[http://www.ssmaritime.com/newsupdates.htm SS France/Norway Project Dubai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622164139/http://www.ssmaritime.com/newsupdates.htm |date=22 June 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?xfile=data/theuae/2006/June/theuae_June870.xml&section=theuae&col Khaleej Times: Dubai bid to save historic cruise liner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930212127/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?xfile=data%2Ftheuae%2F2006%2FJune%2Ftheuae_June870.xml&section=theuae&col |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>

This also cleared the way for her scrapping at [[Alang]], in [[Gujarat]], pending an inspection of the on-board asbestos by experts from the [[Gujarat Pollution Control Board]] (GPCB).<ref>[http://www.maritimematters.com/shipnews.html Maritime Matters Shipnews] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219132435/http://maritimematters.com/shipnews.html |date=19 February 2009 }}</ref>
After GPCB chairman, K.Z. Bhanujan, said the Board had constituted an experts' committee for inspection, ''Blue Lady'' was docked in [[Pipavav]], Kutch District. On 2 August 2006, after a five-day inspection, the experts declared the ship safe for beaching and dismantling in [[Alang]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/2/hi/south_asia/5237334.stm BBC: 'Toxic ship' cleared for breaking]</ref> This prompted a fury of controversy over the legality of such an act, including a press release from the NGO Platform on Shipbreaking that critiqued the technical report, alleging that the Technical Committee was under undue pressure to allow the ship to be beached, and had failed to follow the Basel Convention and the Supreme Court of India's order that ships must be decontaminated of hazardous substances such as PCBs and asbestos, and, in any case, must be fully inventoried and formally notified prior to arrival in the importing country.<ref>[http://www.ban.org/ban_news/2006/060803_irregularities_alleged.html Toxic Trade News; ''Irregularities alleged in the functioning of the Technical Committee on Blue Lady''; 3 August 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.ban.org/Library/NGO_Platform_Critique_on_TC_Inspection_Report_Final.pdf NGO Platform on Shipbreaking; ''Comments on the Indian Committee Inspection Report on the Hazardous Materials Onboard the SS Blue Lady''; 31 July 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806171505/http://www.ban.org/Library/NGO_Platform_Critique_on_TC_Inspection_Report_Final.pdf |date=6 August 2006 }}</ref> No such notification was made by either [[Malaysia]] (last country of departure) nor [[Germany]] (country where the ship became waste).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

The NGO Platform on Shipbreaking also announced that it was prepared to launch a global campaign against Star Cruises and their subsidiary Norwegian Cruise Lines for corporate negligence in this case.<ref>[http://www.ban.org/ban_news/2006/060726_cruise_line.html Toxic Trade News; ''Cruise Line Called on to Take Responsibility for Toxic Cruise Ship''; 26 July 2006]</ref>

[[File:SS France in its avatar of Blue Lady awaits the ship breakers at Alang, August, 2007.jpg|thumb|left|''Blue Lady'' at Alang, India, awaiting scrapping.]]
Photos from Alang revealed that ''Blue Lady'' was still partially afloat off the coast; her bow on dry beach at low tide, and the ship fully afloat at high tide. The photos also showed that neither NCL nor Star Cruises had removed any of the ship's onboard furniture or artworks (including the murals in the Windward Dining Room and Children's Playroom, and the [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] piano in Le Bistro), as had previously been reported.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Fans of ''France'' became concerned about the future of the art pieces, both due to the ship lying at anchor in a very humid environment without power for air conditioning, and due to lack of concern for preservation on the part of the scrappers.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1895897.cms ''The Times of India''; 'Blue Lady' gets ready for shipbreaking; 15 Aug 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.ssnorway.no/images.php the Last of SS Norway Web Auctions: Images] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022222037/http://www.ssnorway.no/images.php |date=22 October 2006 }}</ref> Still, it was stated that as of early September 2006, the ship's owner had signed contracts with various buyers, including auctioneers and a French museum, to sell the artworks. Other fittings were to be sold by the ton.<ref name=\"captainsvoyage\"/>

Gopal Krishna again moved an application seeking compliance with the Basel Convention, and three days later the Indian Supreme Court decided that the scrapping was to be postponed, stipulating that the Technical Committee, which earlier approved the scrapping, were to write a new report to be submitted before the Court's final decision.<ref>[http://www.vg.no/pub/vgart.hbs?artid=126919 Ege, Rune Thomas; VG Net; ''Her ligger hun på stranden''; 17 August 2006 (Article in Norwegian)]</ref> That decision was reached on 11 September 2007 (the 33rd anniversary of ''France's'' last day on the Atlantic), when the court ruled that ''Blue Lady'' was safe to scrap, a decision that was received negatively by environmentalists.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6988763.stm BBC News: ''Indian court clears 'toxic' ship''; 11 September 2007]</ref>

After this they were returned to Le Havre and presented to the [[Musée Malraux]], and now face the front of the harbor.<ref>[http://maritimematters.com/2011/01/ss-france-lettering-illuminated/ SS FRANCE Letters Illuminated]</ref>

==Design==

===Exterior===

====''France''====
{{noref-section|date=December 2018}}
When ''France'' was commissioned in 1956 the French Line asked for a ship which was to be the longest ever built, as well as one of the fastest. But beyond the technicalities, the ship was also to be a [[Ship of state#The ship of state since Plato|Ship of State]] – an ocean-going symbol of France – and thus had to be artfully designed. Her 316-meter (1,035&nbsp;ft) [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was designed with a traditional tumble-home, but with a flared stem line at the bow, which ended in a [[bulbous bow]] beneath the waterline, evoking similar lines on {{SS|Normandie|3=2}}. Also similar to ''Normandie'', ''France'' was equipped with a whaleback on her bow.

Deckhouses on France's [[Superstructure#Engineering concept|superstructure]] were built of aluminium, to reduce the ship's weight and thereby conserve fuel in operation. Within the superstructure a full-length outdoor [[promenade deck]] was designed into both sides of the Pont Canots. Unlike on many other ships, this deck did not wrap completely around the ship, being blocked at the forward end by cabins built in behind the bridgescreen.

One of ''France''{{'}}s most distinguishable features were her funnels, designed not only to be eye-catching but functional as well. They were constructed with two wings on the sides, each to lead the exhaust fumes outwards into the ship's [[slipstream]], where they would be caught by the wind and carried away from the passenger decks below. In addition, each stack had a device that filtered solids from the outlet, returned it into the depths of the ship and then disposed of it into the ocean.

Despite the modern appearance of ''France'', she was painted in the traditional CGT colours, used since the 19th century, of a black hull with red boot-topping and white superstructure, and funnels in red with black cap-bands.

The ship's exterior remained unchanged during her thirteen years of service.

====''Norway''====
[[File:SS Norway on \"maiden\" voyage.jpg|thumb|''Norway'' arriving at Southampton]]
In the conversion of ''France'' into a ship used for cruising, many alterations were made to her exterior decks.

Most notably, vast areas of deck space were opened up, and extended at the stern. A large [[lido]] deck was created at the very aft, built so wide, to accommodate as many sunbathing passengers as possible, that it cantilevered over the hull below, which narrowed in towards the stern at that point. The terrace off the First Class Smoking Room was lost in the construction of an outdoor buffet restaurant, and the Patio Provençal on the Sun Deck was filled in with a top-side [[swimming pool]]. This last addition created an odd space on ''Norway'', where a tunnel-like space remained around the tank of the pool, into which the original exterior windows and doors of the surrounding cabins, which once looked into the Patio Provençal, still opened, all in their original 1960s colours.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

[[File:SS Norway tenders1999.jpg|thumb|left|Tenders ''Little Norway I'' and ''Little Norway II'']]
On the [[forecastle]], behind the whaleback, the two cargo kingposts were removed and giant [[davit]]s were installed to hoist two two-deck, 11-knot [[Ship's tender|tenders]], built by Holen Mekaniske Verksted in Norway, and used to transfer passengers between ''Norway'' and island docks where the harbour would not allow for the ship's 9-meter (35&nbsp;ft) draft. Based on a [[World War 2]] [[landing craft]] design,<ref>{{cite web|title=SS Norway - little Norway|url=http://www.captainsvoyage.com/norwegian-cruise-line/ss-norway/ss-norway---little-norway.html|website=Captains Voyage|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref> these tenders were named ''Little Norway I'' and ''Little Norway II'', and were each themselves registered as ships, making ''Norway'' the only passenger ship in the world to carry ships. The two tenders were removed after the ship's retirement and moved to Norwegian's private island at [[Great Stirrup Cay]] in the [[Bahamas]]. Both vessels are still in service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tender to Great Stirrup Cay|url=https://boards.cruisecritic.co.uk/showthread.php?t=2227992|website=Cruie Critic|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref>

Below the waterline, the forward engine room was dismantled and the two outboard propellers were removed to reduce fuel consumption as a high service speed was no longer required as she was now a cruise ship.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Her operation was revived three further times, in 1990, 1997, and 2001, after machinery, decks, and recreational facilities were renovated. During her 1990 refit, two further decks were added to the top of her structure that featured luxury suites with private verandas. This addition raised her overall tonnage to 76,049 (winning her back the title of largest passenger ship in the world, from the 73,000-ton [[Sovereign of the Seas (cruise ship)|''Sovereign of the Seas'']]), her passenger capacity to 2,565, and gave her a competitive edge against newer ships being built at that time which featured more and more private balcony suites for their passengers. The addition of the decks was criticised by ship fans for making ''Norway'' appear top-heavy.<ref name=\"ssmaritime.com\"/>

===Interior===

====''France''====
''France''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> interiors were where the ship displayed its purpose as a showcase of modern French art and design. However, the interior designers were burdened with the pressure of living up to France's last great Ship of State, ''Normandie'', whose interiors had been on a scale never surpassed either before or since her construction. On top of this they had to work within the more strict fire regulations laid down after the end of [[World War II]], which gave them a limited palette consisting of few woods and much aluminium, Formica, and plastic veneers. This was very much like the interiors of {{SS|United States}}, put into service nearly ten years previous, and inspired the design of the public rooms on {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth 2}} eight years later.<ref name=\"greatoceanliners\"/> Also, fire regulations would not allow ''France'' to have the grand vistas that were constructed through ''Normandie's'' main First Class rooms. ''France's'' only double-height spaces were the theatre, First Class smoking room, and both First and Tourist Class dining rooms.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

One area given an unusual amount of attention was the ship's kitchens; 1,500 square meters in area, and placed almost amidships, between the two dining rooms which the one kitchen served. It was thought by the CGT directors that ''France'' would not only display the best in French art and design, but also French [[cuisine]]. The kitchens were equipped with the most advanced machinery available, as well as many traditional cooking aides, including a stove that was 12 meters long and 2.5 meters wide.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Staffed with 180 of ''France''<nowiki/>'s best cooks, sauce and pastry chefs, rotisserie cooks, head waiters and wine stewards, this team made ''France'' one of the finest restaurants in the world,<ref name=\"ARC1\">Siriex, Françoise and Conquer, Philippe; ''303 Arts, recherces et créations'': SS Normandie/SS France/SS Norway: The Interior Design of ''France''</ref> and the food on board prompted food critic [[Craig Claiborne]] to state ''France's'' Grille Room was the \"best French restaurant in the world.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

''France's'' dog kennels were located on the Sun Deck, and, as they served both European and American dogs, the run was installed with both a Parisian milestone and a New York City fire hydrant.<ref name=\"greatoceanliners\"/>

For First Class passengers, the Pont Veranda (Veranda Deck) held most of the public rooms. These included the Library and Reading Room, Smoking Room, Grand Salon, and balcony of the theatre, which was dedicated to First Class passengers only. These rooms were arranged down the centre of the ship, with large, glass-enclosed promenades to either side. The Library was a circular room with glass and lacquered aluminum enclosed book-cases all around, holding 2,200 editions, and was overseen by an attendant who regulated the borrowing and returning of books, as well as assisting passengers with their choices. The Grand Salon had a raised ceiling in the centre, over the abstract grey and white marble mosaic dance floor, with lower more intimate spaces at the corners. The theatre, which functioned both as a [[Proscenium]] (live theatre) and [[Movie theater|cinema]], sat 185 in the balcony, and 479 on the orchestra level, and had a projection booth which could handle 16, 35, and 70&nbsp;mm film. Until the 1990s it was the largest theatre ever constructed on a ship. However, one of the main showpieces of the First Class salons was the Smoking Room at the very aft of the Pont Veranda. Two stories high, with a raised section in the centre flanked by large columns, and double-height windows to port and starboard, the room was one of the most imposing aboard the ship.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

One level down was Pont Promenade, the main Tourist Class deck. The main lounges and rooms here were the Library, Smoking Room, Grand Salon, and orchestra level of the theatre. Like the Pont Veranda, Pont Promenade also had a glass-enclosed promenade along the port and starboard sides of the ship, though the windows did not run full height, nor were the spaces as long.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Pont A held both First Class and Tourist Class dining rooms. These rooms served as the gastronomic counterparts to the smoking rooms, in terms of importance, and thus of form and décor. The First Class Dining Room was located amidships, and spanned the full width of the ship, accommodating 400 passengers. The centre of the space rose to a circular dome, some 5.5&nbsp;m (18&nbsp;ft) high and, as on  ''Normandie'', passengers entered from one deck up (Pont Principale) and descended a grand, central staircase to the main dining room floor. Glassware, of which there was 4,800 wine and water glasses, was provided by Saint-Louis crystal factory, and tableware consisted of 22,000 china items, with 25,500 pieces of silverware. The Tourist Class Dining Room similarly was two decks high, but differed in that it had dining on the upper level, with only a well between the two floors, and no connecting staircase. It was placed aft of the kitchens, and sat 826 people. Next to the upper level of this dining room was the Children's Dining Room, which allowed both First and Second class parents to dine without the \"inconvenience\" of young children.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

After the first few of ''France's'' cruises, CGT executives realised that there was a problem regarding the naming of the public rooms. After her entrance into service, the rooms were simply known as the \"First Class Grand Salon,\" \"First Class Dining Room,\" \"Tourist Class Library,\" etc. However, during a cruise, where class barriers were withdrawn and all passengers were allowed to use all the spaces equally, it became a slight embarrassment for a passenger travelling in a large cabin to ask a steward for directions to the Tourist Class Dining Room. Hence, proper names were applied to each room to avoid the issue:{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

* First Class Salon - Salon Fontainebleau
* First Class Music Room - Salon Debussy
* First Class Card Room - Salon Monaco
* First Class Smoking Room - Salon Riviera
* First Class Dining Room - Salle à Manger Chambord
* Tourist Class Salon - Salon Saint Tropez
* Tourist Class Music Room - Salon Ravel
* Tourist Class Smoking Room - Cafe Rive Gauche
* Tourist Class Dining Room - Salle à Manger Versailles

Some anomalies that contravened the class lines were ''Bar de l'Atlantique'', essentially an after-hours club for drinking and dancing late into the night which was open to both First and Tourist Class passengers, the Tourist Children's' Playroom, and the Chapel, open as well to both classes, all of which were located on First Class Pont Veranda.<ref>[http://perso.orange.fr/paquebot.france-norway/visite/VisiteVirtuelle/PageVisiteVV13.html Bar de l'Atlantique]</ref><ref>[http://perso.orange.fr/paquebot.france-norway/visite/VisiteVirtuelle/PageVisiteVV21.html Salle de Jeux Enfants]</ref>

=====Art=====
The décor of the rooms was regarded itself as art, with many notable French designers and artists commissioned to create the most striking spaces at sea. Beyond this, many pieces of artwork were especially ordered to adorn the walls of the dining rooms, lounges and cabins. Within the Salon Riviera the tapestry by Jean Picart le Doux dominated the entire forward wall, at 17.4&nbsp;m (57&nbsp;ft) long. In the same room two paintings by Roger Chapelain-Midy occupied niches in opposite corners to the aft. The overall interior was designed by Airbus, who had previously worked with Chapelain-Midy to design sets for a performance of [[Les Indes galantes]] at the [[Palais Garnier]] in 1952. Slightly forward, the Salon Fontainebleau was decorated by [[Maxime Old]], and within was contained three tapestries by Lucien Coutaud (''Les femmes fleurs''), two by Claude Idoux (''Jardin magique'', ''Fée Mirabelle'') and [[Camille Hilaire]] (''Sous-bois, Forêt de France''). Near to that room was the Salon Debussy (Music Room) with three bronze lacquered panels by Bobot, and a bronze abstract sculpture of a young woman playing a flute, by Hubert Yencesse. The theatre's interior was done in red, grey and gold by Peynet, with the ceiling in grey mosaic tile, and the port and starboard walls in vertical gold lacquered aluminium panels, tilted outwards to allow for recessed lighting from behind. The Chapel's interior was created by Anne Carlu Subes (daughter of [[Jacques Carlu]]) in silver anodized aluminium panels arranged in a 45-degree grid pattern. Jacques Noël created [[trompe-l'œil]] panels for all four walls of the First Class Children's Playroom in a [[Renaissance]] theme, and Jean A. Mercier painted a full mural entitled ''Une nouvelle arche de Noé'' (A New [[Noah's Arc]]) for the Tourist Class Children's' Playroom, using an abstract rendition of ''France'' as the Arc. The Bar de l'Atlantique contained two ceramics by [[Pablo Picasso]], as well three other ceramic sculptures (''Faune cavalier'', ''Portrait de Jacqueline'' and ''Joueur de flûte et danseuse'') by the artist in the Salon Saint-Tropez.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Lower down the dining rooms were fitted out with the intention that the rooms would be visual equivalents of the excellent food served within them. The Chambord dining room was decorated by Mrs. Darbois-Gaudin in gold [[Anodising|anodized]] aluminium, with monochrome chairs in red, orange and cream. The dome, painted black, contained an array of recessed spot-lights, and sat within a circular band of translucent, fluorescent-lit panels, all on a truncated rotunda of gold aluminium. Around all four walls of the room Jean Mandaroux's continuous mural, painted on 17 lacquered aluminium sheets, was entitled ''Les plaisirs de la vie'': The Pleasures of Life. Less sumptuous in design, the Versailles dining room was done by Marc Simon in tones of green, white and grey. The walls were produced from Polyrey and [[Formica]] with a [[decoupage]]d gold leaf abstract pattern. Only the forward wall held a mural done in 14 engraved glass panels by Max Ingrand, as well as two tapestries, ''Les amoureux du printemps'' by Marc Saint-Saëns, and ''Paysage provençal'' by Auvigné. Lowest in the ship, the walls of the First Class swimming pool were covered with back-lit engraved glass panels by Max Ingrand, and a ceramic sculptural fountain by Jean Mayodon sat at the forward end of the room.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

The First Class cabins also showcased design and art, especially in the Appartements de Grand Luxe. There were two aboard ''France'', amidships, on the port and starboard sides, on Pont Supérieur. Each had a salon, dining room, two bedrooms, and three bathrooms. The Appartement de Grand Luxe [[Île de France]] held a painting, ''La place de la Concorde'', by [[Bernard Lamotte]], as well as one, ''Parc de [[Gardens of Versailles|Versailles]]'', by [[Jean Carzou]], who also designed the suite's main salon. Slightly less expensive were the Appartements de Luxe, of which there were 12, as the Appartement de Luxe Flandres with a painting of [[Jean Dries]]. Each of these was decorated by artists, including the bathrooms where mosaic artwork adorned the walls around tubs and showers.<ref>[http://www.revedefrance.com/nouvellepage14.htm Les ponts et ses aménagements: Ses Intérieurs]</ref> Some of the mosaics were by the sculptor [[Jacques Zwobada]].<ref>Bernard Vasseur, ''Jacques Zwobada – L'œuvre dessiné'' (Paris: Éditions Cercle d'Art, 2008)</ref>

====''Norway''====
After the ship was purchased by Kloster in 1979 many of the original 1960s interiors were lost as rooms were either demolished within larger renovations, or redecorated to suit Caribbean cruising, under the direction of maritime architect Tage Wandborg and New York interior designer Angelo Donghia.<ref name=autogenerated3>Conquer, Philippe; ''303 Arts, recherces et créations'': SS Normandie/SS France/SS Norway: Love's Labours... Lost?</ref> Areas that were completely remodelled included all of the Tourist Class public rooms, and their indoor promenade areas were filled with prefabricated \"junior suite\" cabins. The former Versailles dining room, now the [[Leeward]], saw the least remodelling, the wall finish and etched glass mural remaining; however, carpeting and furniture was replaced, the open well was lined with [[smoked glass]] and aluminium handrails, an aluminium chandelier was placed over the two-storey space, and a spiral staircase was installed to connect the two levels. The former Salon Saint Tropez became ''Norway's'' North Cape Lounge for [[cabaret]] and other shows; the décor more dark and muted. Further forward on the same deck, the old Café Rive Gauche was transformed into the ship's [[Monte Carlo]] [[casino]]. With the promenade windows now within cabins, no daylight penetrated to the casino, and so all windows were filled in. The Tourist Class swimming pool, its glass dome gone after the construction of the open pool deck above, was filled with neon lights and covered with a glass dance floor as part of the remodelling of the entire space into the ship's Dazzles disco.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

However, most First Class rooms were left intact, save for the Salon Riviera and Salon Fontainebleau. The former was transformed into the Club International (dubbed Club-I by ''Norway'' aficionados), where every element of the original décor was removed. The square columns were made round with vertical aluminium fluting, the walls were repainted in a cream with baby-blue in the ceiling and wall niches, and all the original artwork and furniture was removed. In the corner niches oversized, crystal encrusted [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] statues were placed, and similar crystal garlanded busts sat on brackets on the forward bulkhead. Lounge seating, sofas and rattan chairs were placed amongst potted ferns, giving the room an overall [[Miami]] [[art-deco]] feel. Only the railings and bronze, star-shaped light fixtures were original to the room. The latter space was gutted and remade into Checkers Cabaret; a small show lounge with abstract chrome palm trees around the columns, red lacquered wall panels, and a black-and-white [[Draughts|checker board]] dance floor, again evoking a 1920s jazz club. The First Class Library remained untouched, and still used for the same purpose, while the Salon Debussy was turned into a shop, though its bronze décor and distinctive ceiling remained intact. To either side of these rooms ran the original First Class promenade decks, which were now turned into main circulation halls along the ship's principal public deck; the starboard dubbed [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] and the port as [[Champs-Élysées]], complete with columnar advertising posts similar to those found in [[Paris]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

===Main Propulsion===
''France'' was constructed by the CGT with speed and comfort in mind, and used the most advanced technology of the time in the design of the ship's propulsion system and other power generating machinery. Fuel costs were also an added factor.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Her engines consisted of eight high-pressure, super-heating boilers delivering {{convert|64|bar|psi}} of pressure and {{convert|500|°C|°F}}, all weighing 8,000 tons. This delivered {{convert|175000|hp|kW}} and provided for a service speed of {{convert|30|kn}} and a maximum speed of {{convert|35|kn}}, with a fuel consumption of 750 tonnes of oil in a 24-hour period. The machinery turning the four propellers was divided into two fore and aft groups, as was the electrical generating station.<ref name=\"Offrey; p. 52\"/>

When ''France'' was converted into ''Norway'', the speed for trans-Atlantic crossing was no longer needed, and so the forward boilers and engines were shut down and eventually dismantled. This move also reduced the fuel consumption to 250 tonnes per 24 hours. The remaining four boilers and engine room were made fully automated, and operated from either a central control station below decks, or from the bridge. Five bow and stern thrusters, developing 10,600&nbsp;hp, were also installed to increase manoeuvrability in ports without the assistance of tugs.<ref name=\"ARC1\" />

==Media appearance==

''France'', as one of the last transatlantic ocean liners before the [[Jet Age|jet age]], was also treated as the connection between, for example, New York and France. This was shown well in ''[[Le Gendarme à New York]]'' where the main characters sail on ''France''. The film also shows some of the 60s' interior of the ship.<ref name=\"youtube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4KXcLUvfAE|title=YouTube|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref> At the conclusion of the 1973 film ''[[Serpico]]'', the title character can be seen sitting on the dock with the vessel behind him, as he prepares to sail on her into exile after testifying against the [[New York Police Department]]. During the opening of ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'', also directed by Sidney Lumet, there is a shot of ''France'' docked in New York during the opening montage.

''France'' appears in the ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]'' episode \"The Werewolf\" as the cruise ship (on which the story takes place) at sea.

''France'' was also seen in the 2015 animated feature ''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]'' as the ship the three minions saw before entering [[New York City]] in 1968.

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' season 25 episode 12 \"Diggs\". The episode's Couch Gag featured an animation by [[Sylvain Chomet]]. A picture of ''France'' replaced the picture of the boat.<ref name=\"Chomet Couch Gag | Season 25 Ep. 12 \">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOi5OF7gAiM|title=YouTube|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=19 January 2017}}</ref>

In 1986, the American TV show, ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]'' spent a week-long cruise aboard ''Norway''.

''Norway'' appears in the 1989 María Sorté/Enrique Novi Mexican telenovela ''[[Mi Segunda Madre]]'' from episode 18 as the cruise ship (on which the romantic story takes place) at [[PortMiami]] and at sea.{{cn|date=March 2019}}

''Norway'' appears during the closing credits of the 1994 Sylvester Stallone/Sharon Stone feature ''[[The Specialist]]'' in a flyover of the Port of Miami.

The story in the [[Ric Hochet]] comic album ''[[Rapt sur le France]]'' takes place on ''France''.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 1994, the ship as then-owned by NCL as the ''Norway'', was featured in the children's show [[Real Wheels]] in the episode ''There Goes A Boat''.

On 30 July 1998, at the request of a passenger, the pilots of [[Proteus Airlines Flight 706]] made a slight detour from their intended route from [[Lyon]] to [[Lorient]] in [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]], to see ''Norway'' that was anchored in nearby [[Quiberon Bay]].  While circling the ship at a low altitude to give passengers a birds-eye view of the iconic former French vessel, the twin-engined [[Beechcraft 1900|Beechcraft 1900D]] was hit by a [[Cessna 177 Cardinal|Cessna 177]], causing both to crash into the bay and killing all 15 people aboard both aircraft.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nyti.ms/2bvV02U|title=World News Briefs: Air Collision Off France Kills 7, and 8 Are Lost|work=The New York Times|issue=Vol. 147 No. 51,235|agency=The Associated Press|publisher=New York Times Company|date=31 July 1998|page=A5}}</ref> The event was chronicled in the Canadian TV series, ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]'' season 16, episode 5: \"Deadly Detour\".

{{Antimatter}}
{{Modern physics}}

In [[modern physics]], '''antimatter''' is defined as [[matter]] which is composed of the [[antiparticle]]s (or \"partners\") of the corresponding [[subatomic particle|particles]] of 'ordinary' matter (''[[koinomatter]]'').  Minuscule numbers of antiparticles are generated daily at [[particle accelerator]]s – total production has been only a few [[nanogram]]s<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2018-11-08|title=Ten things you might not know about antimatter|url=https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2015/ten-things-you-might-not-know-about-antimatter|newspaper=symmetry magazine}}</ref> – and in natural processes like [[cosmic ray]] collisions and some types of [[radioactive decay]], but only a tiny fraction of these have successfully been bound together in experiments to form anti-atoms. No [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] amount of antimatter has ever been assembled due to the extreme cost and difficulty of production and handling.

In theory, a particle and its anti-particle (for example, proton and antiproton) have the same mass, but opposite [[electric charge]] and other differences in [[quantum number]]s. For example, a proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge.

A collision between any particle and its anti-particle partner leads to their ''mutual [[annihilation]]'', giving rise to various proportions of intense [[photon]]s ([[gamma ray]]s), [[neutrino]]s, and sometimes less-massive particle-antiparticle pairs. The majority of the total energy of annihilation emerges in the form of [[ionizing radiation]]. If surrounding matter is present, the energy content of this radiation will be absorbed and converted into other forms of energy such as heat or light. The amount of the released energy is usually proportional to the total mass of the collided matter and antimatter, in accordance with the [[mass–energy equivalence]] equation, {{nowrap|1=''E''=''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}.<ref>

Antimatter particles bind with each other to form antimatter, just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter. For example, a [[positron]] (the antiparticle of the [[electron]]) and an [[antiproton]] (the antiparticle of the [[proton]]) can form an [[antihydrogen]] atom. The nuclei of [[#Antihelium|antihelium]] have been artificially produced with difficulty, and these are the most complex anti-nuclei so far observed.<ref>

==Conceptual history==
The idea of [[negative matter]] appears in past theories of matter that have now been abandoned. Using the once popular [[vortex theory of gravity]], the possibility of matter with negative gravity was discussed by [[William Mitchinson Hicks|William Hicks]] in the 1880s. Between the 1880s and the 1890s, [[Karl Pearson]] proposed the existence of \"squirts\"<ref>

}}</ref> and sinks of the flow of [[Luminiferous aether|aether]]. The squirts represented normal matter and the sinks represented negative matter. Pearson's theory required a fourth dimension for the aether to flow from and into.<ref>

Schuster's ideas were not a serious theoretical proposal, merely speculation, and like the previous ideas, differed from the modern concept of antimatter in that it possessed [[antigravity|negative gravity]].<ref>

These were discovered by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl D. Anderson]] in 1932 and named [[positron]]s (a [[portmanteau]] of \"positive electron\").

==Notation==
One way to denote an [[antiparticle]] is by adding a bar over the particle's symbol. For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as {{Subatomic particle|proton}} and {{Subatomic particle|antiproton}}, respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down quark}} [[quark]]s, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down antiquark}} [[antiquark]]s. Another convention is to distinguish particles by their [[electric charge]]. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as {{Subatomic particle|Electron}} and {{Subatomic particle|Positron}} respectively. However, to prevent confusion, the two conventions are never mixed.

==Properties==
There are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that, aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges (such as electric and baryon charges), matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties.<ref>

==Origin and asymmetry==

Antiparticles are created everywhere in the [[universe]] where high-energy particle collisions take place. High-energy [[cosmic ray]]s impacting [[Earth's atmosphere]] (or any other matter in the [[Solar System]]) produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting [[particle jet]]s, which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter. They may similarly be produced in regions like the [[Galactic Center|center]] of the [[Milky Way]] and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of [[relativistic jet]]s with the [[interstellar medium]]). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two [[gamma ray]]s produced every time [[positron]]s annihilate with nearby matter. The [[frequency]] and [[wavelength]] of the gamma rays indicate that each carries 511&nbsp;[[electronvolt|keV]] of energy (that is, the [[rest mass]] of an [[electron]] multiplied by ''[[speed of light|c]]''<sup>2</sup>).

Observations by the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[INTEGRAL|INTEGRAL satellite]] may explain the origin of a giant antimatter cloud surrounding the galactic center. The observations show that the cloud is asymmetrical and matches the pattern of [[X-ray binaries]] (binary star systems containing black holes or neutron stars), mostly on one side of the galactic center. While the mechanism is not fully understood, it is likely to involve the production of electron–positron pairs, as ordinary matter gains kinetic energy while falling into a [[stellar remnant]].<ref>

==Natural production==
{{main|Positron emission}}

Positrons are produced naturally in β<sup>+</sup> decays of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes (for example, [[potassium-40]]) and in interactions of gamma quanta (emitted by radioactive nuclei) with matter. [[Antineutrino]]s are another kind of antiparticle created by natural radioactivity (β<sup>−</sup> decay). Many different kinds of antiparticles are also produced by (and contained in) [[cosmic ray]]s. In January 2011, research by the [[American Astronomical Society]] discovered antimatter (positrons) originating above [[thunderstorm]] clouds; positrons are produced in gamma-ray flashes created by electrons accelerated by strong electric fields in the clouds.<ref>

===Observation in cosmic rays===
{{main|Cosmic ray}}

Satellite experiments have found evidence of [[positron]]s and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays, amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays. This antimatter cannot all have been created in the Big Bang, but is instead attributed to have been produced by cyclic processes at high energies. For instance, electron-positron pairs may be formed in [[pulsar]]s, as a magnetized neutron star rotation cycle shears electron-positron pairs from the star surface. Therein the antimatter forms a wind which crashes upon the ejecta of the progenitor supernovae. This weathering takes place as \"the cold, magnetized relativistic wind launched by the star hits the non-relativistically expanding ejecta, a shock wave system forms in the impact: the outer one propagates in the ejecta, while a reverse shock propagates back towards the star.\"<ref>

Preliminary results from the presently operating [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] (''AMS-02'') on board the [[International Space Station]] show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality, and with energies that range from 10 [[wikt:gigaelectron volt|GeV]] to 250&nbsp;GeV. In September, 2014, new results with almost twice as much data were presented in a talk at CERN and published in Physical Review Letters.<ref>

Cosmic ray antiprotons also have a much higher energy than their normal-matter counterparts (protons). They arrive at Earth with a characteristic energy maximum of 2&nbsp;GeV, indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons, which on average have only one-sixth of the energy.<ref>

There is an ongoing search for larger antimatter nuclei, such as [[#Antihelium|antihelium]] nuclei (that is, anti-alpha particles), in cosmic rays. The detection of natural antihelium could imply the existence of large antimatter structures such as an antistar. A prototype of the ''AMS-02'' designated ''AMS-01'', was flown into space aboard the {{OV|103}} on [[STS-91]] in June 1998. By not detecting any [[#Antihelium|antihelium]] at all, the ''AMS-01'' established an upper limit of 1.1×10<sup>−6</sup> for the antihelium to helium [[flux]] ratio.<ref>

In addition to anti[[baryon]]s, anti-nuclei consisting of multiple bound antiprotons and antineutrons have been created. These are typically produced at energies far too high to form antimatter atoms (with bound positrons in place of electrons). In 1965, a group of researchers led by [[Antonino Zichichi]] reported production of nuclei of antideuterium at the Proton Synchrotron at [[CERN]].<ref>

<!-- Should antihelium be folded into this section? I haven't checked to see whether they'd created antihelium nuclei or true antihelium atoms with bound positrons. -->

In 1995, [[CERN]] announced that it had successfully brought into existence nine hot antihydrogen atoms by implementing the [[SLAC]]/[[Fermilab]] concept during the [[PS210 experiment]]. The experiment was performed using the [[Low Energy Antiproton Ring]] (LEAR), and was led by Walter Oelert and Mario Macri.<ref>

}}</ref> Fermilab soon confirmed the CERN findings by producing approximately 100 antihydrogen atoms at their facilities. The antihydrogen atoms created during PS210 and subsequent experiments (at both CERN and Fermilab) were extremely energetic and were not well suited to study. To resolve this hurdle, and to gain a better understanding of antihydrogen, two collaborations were formed in the late 1990s, namely, [[ATHENA]] and [[ATRAP]].

In 1999, CERN activated the [[Antiproton Decelerator]], a device capable of decelerating antiprotons from {{val|3500|ul=MeV}} to {{val|5.3|u=MeV}}&nbsp;– still too \"hot\" to produce study-effective antihydrogen, but a huge leap forward. In late 2002 the ATHENA project announced that they had created the world's first \"cold\" antihydrogen.<ref>

The antiprotons are still hot when initially trapped. To cool them further, they are mixed into an electron plasma. The electrons in this plasma cool via cyclotron radiation, and then sympathetically cool the antiprotons via [[Coulomb potential|Coulomb]] collisions. Eventually, the electrons are removed by the application of short-duration electric fields, leaving the antiprotons with energies less than {{val|100|u=[[Electronvolt|meV]]}}.<ref>

Manipulations of the trap electrodes then tip the antiprotons into the positron plasma, where some combine with antiprotons to form antihydrogen. This neutral antihydrogen is unaffected by the electric and magnetic fields used to trap the charged positrons and antiprotons, and within a few microseconds the antihydrogen hits the trap walls, where it annihilates. Some hundreds of millions of antihydrogen atoms have been made in this fashion.

In 2005, ATHENA disbanded and some of the former members (along with others) formed the [[ALPHA Collaboration]], which is also based at CERN. The ultimate goal of this endeavour is to test [[CPT symmetry]] through comparison of the [[atomic spectra]] of [[hydrogen]] and antihydrogen (see [[hydrogen spectral series]]).<ref>

In 2016 a new antiproton decelerator and cooler called ELENA (E Low Energy Antiproton decelerator) was built. It takes the antiprotons from the antiproton decelerator and cools them to 90&nbsp;keV, which is \"cold\" enough to study. This machine works by using high energy and accelerating the particles within the chamber. More than one hundred antiprotons can be captured per second, a huge improvement, but it would still take several thousand years to make a [[nanogram]] of antimatter.

Most of the sought-after high-precision tests of the properties of antihydrogen could only be performed if the antihydrogen were trapped, that is, held in place for a relatively long time. While antihydrogen atoms are electrically neutral, the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of their component particles produce a [[magnetic moment]]. These magnetic moments can interact with an inhomogeneous magnetic field; some of the antihydrogen atoms can be attracted to a magnetic minimum. Such a minimum can be created by a combination of mirror and multipole fields.<ref>

===Preservation===
<!--===Antimatter trap===!-->

Antimatter cannot be stored in a container made of ordinary matter because antimatter reacts with any matter it touches, annihilating itself and an equal amount of the container. Antimatter in the form of [[charged particle]]s can be contained by a combination of [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields, in a device called a [[Penning trap]]. This device cannot, however, contain antimatter that consists of uncharged particles, for which [[atomic trap]]s are used. In particular, such a trap may use the [[dipole]] moment ([[Electric dipole moment|electric]] or [[Magnetic moment|magnetic]]) of the trapped particles. At high [[vacuum]], the matter or antimatter particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off-resonant laser radiation using a [[magneto-optical trap]] or [[Magnetic trap (atoms)|magnetic trap]]. Small particles can also be suspended with [[optical tweezers]], using a highly focused laser beam.<ref>

==Uses==

===Medical===
Matter–antimatter reactions have practical applications in medical imaging, such as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET). In positive [[beta decay]], a [[nuclide]] loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron (in the same event, a proton becomes a neutron, and a [[neutrino]] is also emitted). Nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a [[cyclotron]] and are widely generated for medical use. Antiprotons have also been shown within laboratory experiments to have the potential to treat certain cancers, in a similar method currently used for ion (proton) therapy.<ref>

The reaction of {{val|1|ul=kg}} of antimatter with {{val|1|u=kg}} of matter would produce {{val|1.8|e=17|ul=J}} (180 petajoules) of energy (by the [[mass–energy equivalence]] formula, {{nowrap|1=''E''=''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}), or the rough equivalent of 43 megatons of TNT – slightly less than the yield of the 27,000&nbsp;kg [[Tsar Bomba]], the largest [[thermonuclear weapon]] ever detonated.

Not all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic propulsion technology because of the nature of the annihilation products. While electron–positron reactions result in gamma ray photons, these are difficult to direct and use for thrust. In reactions between protons and antiprotons, their energy is converted largely into relativistic neutral and charged [[pion]]s. The [[Pion#Neutral pion decays|neutral pions]] decay almost immediately (with a lifetime of 85 [[attoseconds]]) into high-energy photons, but the [[Pion#Charged pion decays|charged pions]] decay more slowly (with a lifetime of 26 nanoseconds) and can be [[Antimatter rocket#Direct use of reaction products|deflected magnetically to produce thrust]].

Charged pions ultimately decay into a combination of [[neutrino]]s (carrying about 22% of the energy of the charged pions) and unstable charged [[muon]]s (carrying about 78% of the charged pion energy), with the muons then decaying into a combination of electrons, positrons and neutrinos (cf. [[muon decay]]; the neutrinos from this decay carry about 2/3 of the energy of the muons, meaning that from the original charged pions, the total fraction of their energy converted to neutrinos by one route or another would be about {{nowrap|1=0.22 + (2/3)⋅0.78=0.74}}).<ref>

For more regular (earthly) applications (for example, regular transport, use in portable generators, powering of cities, ...) artificially created antimatter is not a suitable energy carrier, despite its high energy density, because the process of creating antimatter is extremely inefficient.

Some researchers{{Who|date=May 2012}} claim that with current technology, it is possible to obtain antimatter for [[United States dollar|US$]]25 million per gram by optimizing the collision and collection parameters (given current electricity generation costs).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
Many experts{{Who|date=March 2011}}, however, dispute these claims as being far too optimistic by many orders of magnitude. They point out that, in 2004, the annual production of antiprotons at [[CERN]] was several picograms at a cost of $20 million. This means that to produce 1&nbsp;gram of antimatter, [[CERN]] would need to spend 100 quadrillion ({{val|e=17}}) dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years.

Antimatter production costs, in mass production, are almost linearly tied to electricity costs, so economical pure-antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online unless a very cheap power source is found.

Storage is another problem, as antiprotons are negatively charged and repel each other, so that they cannot be concentrated in a small volume (cf. [[space charge]]). [[Plasma oscillation]]s in the charged cloud of antiprotons can cause instabilities that drive antiprotons out of the storage trap. For these reasons, to date, only a few million antiprotons have been stored simultaneously in a magnetic trap, which corresponds to much less than a femtogram. Antihydrogen atoms or molecules are of neutral charge, they are not as ionically unstable as antiprotons . The drawback is that cold antihydrogen is far more complex to produce than mere antiprotons.

One researcher from the CERN laboratories, which produces antimatter regularly, said:

{{Antimatter}}
{{Modern physics}}

In [[modern physics]], '''antimatter''' is defined as [[matter]] which is composed of the [[antiparticle]]s (or \"partners\") of the corresponding [[subatomic particle|particles]] of 'ordinary' matter (''[[koinomatter]]'').  Minuscule numbers of antiparticles are generated daily at [[particle accelerator]]s – total production has been only a few [[nanogram]]s<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2018-11-08|title=Ten things you might not know about antimatter|url=https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2015/ten-things-you-might-not-know-about-antimatter|newspaper=symmetry magazine}}</ref> – and in natural processes like [[cosmic ray]] collisions and some types of [[radioactive decay]], but only a tiny fraction of these have successfully been bound together in experiments to form anti-atoms. No [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] amount of antimatter has ever been assembled due to the extreme cost and difficulty of production and handling.

In theory, a particle and its anti-particle (for example, proton and antiproton) have the same mass, but opposite [[electric charge]] and other differences in [[quantum number]]s. For example, a proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge.

A collision between any particle and its anti-particle partner leads to their ''mutual [[annihilation]]'', giving rise to various proportions of intense [[photon]]s ([[gamma ray]]s), [[neutrino]]s, and sometimes less-massive particle-antiparticle pairs. The majority of the total energy of annihilation emerges in the form of [[ionizing radiation]]. If surrounding matter is present, the energy content of this radiation will be absorbed and converted into other forms of energy such as heat or light. The amount of the released energy is usually proportional to the total mass of the collided matter and antimatter, in accordance with the [[mass–energy equivalence]] equation, {{nowrap|1=''E''=''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}.<ref>

Antimatter particles bind with each other to form antimatter, just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter. For example, a [[positron]] (the antiparticle of the [[electron]]) and an [[antiproton]] (the antiparticle of the [[proton]]) can form an [[antihydrogen]] atom. The nuclei of [[#Antihelium|antihelium]] have been artificially produced with difficulty, and these are the most complex anti-nuclei so far observed.<ref>

==Conceptual history==
The idea of [[negative matter]] appears in past theories of matter that have now been abandoned. Using the once popular [[vortex theory of gravity]], the possibility of matter with negative gravity was discussed by [[William Mitchinson Hicks|William Hicks]] in the 1880s. Between the 1880s and the 1890s, [[Karl Pearson]] proposed the existence of \"squirts\"<ref>

}}</ref> and sinks of the flow of [[Luminiferous aether|aether]]. The squirts represented normal matter and the sinks represented negative matter. Pearson's theory required a fourth dimension for the aether to flow from and into.<ref>

The term antimatter was first used by [[Arthur Schuster]] in two rather whimsical letters to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1898,<ref>

}}</ref> in which he coined the term. He hypothesized antiatoms, as well as whole antimatter solar systems, and discussed the possibility of matter and antimatter annihilating each other. Schuster's ideas were not a serious theoretical proposal, merely speculation, and like the previous ideas, differed from the modern concept of antimatter in that it possessed [[antigravity|negative gravity]].<ref>

==Notation==
One way to denote an [[antiparticle]] is by adding a bar over the particle's symbol. For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as {{Subatomic particle|proton}} and {{Subatomic particle|antiproton}}, respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down quark}} [[quark]]s, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down antiquark}} [[antiquark]]s. Another convention is to distinguish particles by their [[electric charge]]. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as {{Subatomic particle|Electron}} and {{Subatomic particle|Positron}} respectively. However, to prevent confusion, the two conventions are never mixed.

==Properties==
There are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that, aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges (such as electric and baryon charges), matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties.<ref>

In fact, there may be half the stars of each kind. The two kinds of stars would both show exactly the same spectra, and there would be no way of distinguishing them by present astronomical methods.'' {{harvnb|Dirac|1965|page=325}}</ref> This idea was tested experimentally in 2016 by the [[Antiproton Decelerator#ALPHA|ALPHA]] experiment, which measured the transition between the two lowest energy states of [[antihydrogen]].

==Origin and asymmetry==

Most matter observable from the Earth seems to be made of matter rather than antimatter. If antimatter-dominated regions of space existed, the gamma rays produced in annihilation reactions along the boundary between matter and antimatter regions would be detectable.<ref>

Antiparticles are created everywhere in the [[universe]] where high-energy particle collisions take place. High-energy [[cosmic ray]]s impacting [[Earth's atmosphere]] (or any other matter in the [[Solar System]]) produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting [[particle jet]]s, which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter. They may similarly be produced in regions like the [[Galactic Center|center]] of the [[Milky Way]] and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of [[relativistic jet]]s with the [[interstellar medium]]). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two [[gamma ray]]s produced every time [[positron]]s annihilate with nearby matter. The [[frequency]] and [[wavelength]] of the gamma rays indicate that each carries 511&nbsp;[[electronvolt|keV]] of energy (that is, the [[rest mass]] of an [[electron]] multiplied by ''[[speed of light|c]]''<sup>2</sup>).

Observations by the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[INTEGRAL|INTEGRAL satellite]] may explain the origin of a giant antimatter cloud surrounding the galactic center. The observations show that the cloud is asymmetrical and matches the pattern of [[X-ray binaries]] (binary star systems containing black holes or neutron stars), mostly on one side of the galactic center. While the mechanism is not fully understood, it is likely to involve the production of electron–positron pairs, as ordinary matter gains kinetic energy while falling into a [[stellar remnant]].<ref>

==Natural production==
{{main|Positron emission}}

Positrons are produced naturally in β<sup>+</sup> decays of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes (for example, [[potassium-40]]) and in interactions of gamma quanta (emitted by radioactive nuclei) with matter. [[Antineutrino]]s are another kind of antiparticle created by natural radioactivity (β<sup>−</sup> decay). Many different kinds of antiparticles are also produced by (and contained in) [[cosmic ray]]s. In January 2011, research by the [[American Astronomical Society]] discovered antimatter (positrons) originating above [[thunderstorm]] clouds; positrons are produced in gamma-ray flashes created by electrons accelerated by strong electric fields in the clouds.<ref>

===Observation in cosmic rays===
{{main|Cosmic ray}}

Satellite experiments have found evidence of [[positron]]s and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays, amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays. This antimatter cannot all have been created in the Big Bang, but is instead attributed to have been produced by cyclic processes at high energies. For instance, electron-positron pairs may be formed in [[pulsar]]s, as a magnetized neutron star rotation cycle shears electron-positron pairs from the star surface. Therein the antimatter forms a wind which crashes upon the ejecta of the progenitor supernovae. This weathering takes place as \"the cold, magnetized relativistic wind launched by the star hits the non-relativistically expanding ejecta, a shock wave system forms in the impact: the outer one propagates in the ejecta, while a reverse shock propagates back towards the star.\"<ref>

They arrive at Earth with a characteristic energy maximum of 2&nbsp;GeV, indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons, which on average have only one-sixth of the energy.<ref>

There is an ongoing search for larger antimatter nuclei, such as [[#Antihelium|antihelium]] nuclei (that is, anti-alpha particles), in cosmic rays. The detection of natural antihelium could imply the existence of large antimatter structures such as an antistar. A prototype of the ''AMS-02'' designated ''AMS-01'', was flown into space aboard the {{OV|103}} on [[STS-91]] in June 1998. By not detecting any [[#Antihelium|antihelium]] at all, the ''AMS-01'' established an upper limit of 1.1×10<sup>−6</sup> for the antihelium to helium [[flux]] ratio.<ref>

In addition to anti[[baryon]]s, anti-nuclei consisting of multiple bound antiprotons and antineutrons have been created. These are typically produced at energies far too high to form antimatter atoms (with bound positrons in place of electrons). In 1965, a group of researchers led by [[Antonino Zichichi]] reported production of nuclei of antideuterium at the Proton Synchrotron at [[CERN]].<ref>

===Antihydrogen atoms===
{{Main|Antihydrogen}}
<!-- Should antihelium be folded into this section? I haven't checked to see whether they'd created antihelium nuclei or true antihelium atoms with bound positrons. -->

In 1995, [[CERN]] announced that it had successfully brought into existence nine hot antihydrogen atoms by implementing the [[SLAC]]/[[Fermilab]] concept during the [[PS210 experiment]]. The experiment was performed using the [[Low Energy Antiproton Ring]] (LEAR), and was led by Walter Oelert and Mario Macri.<ref>

}}</ref> Fermilab soon confirmed the CERN findings by producing approximately 100 antihydrogen atoms at their facilities. The antihydrogen atoms created during PS210 and subsequent experiments (at both CERN and Fermilab) were extremely energetic and were not well suited to study. To resolve this hurdle, and to gain a better understanding of antihydrogen, two collaborations were formed in the late 1990s, namely, [[ATHENA]] and [[ATRAP]].

In 1999, CERN activated the [[Antiproton Decelerator]], a device capable of decelerating antiprotons from {{val|3500|ul=MeV}} to {{val|5.3|u=MeV}}&nbsp;– still too \"hot\" to produce study-effective antihydrogen, but a huge leap forward. In late 2002 the ATHENA project announced that they had created the world's first \"cold\" antihydrogen.<ref>

The antiprotons are still hot when initially trapped. To cool them further, they are mixed into an electron plasma. The electrons in this plasma cool via cyclotron radiation, and then sympathetically cool the antiprotons via [[Coulomb potential|Coulomb]] collisions. Eventually, the electrons are removed by the application of short-duration electric fields, leaving the antiprotons with energies less than {{val|100|u=[[Electronvolt|meV]]}}.<ref>

Manipulations of the trap electrodes then tip the antiprotons into the positron plasma, where some combine with antiprotons to form antihydrogen. This neutral antihydrogen is unaffected by the electric and magnetic fields used to trap the charged positrons and antiprotons, and within a few microseconds the antihydrogen hits the trap walls, where it annihilates. Some hundreds of millions of antihydrogen atoms have been made in this fashion.

In 2005, ATHENA disbanded and some of the former members (along with others) formed the [[ALPHA Collaboration]], which is also based at CERN. The ultimate goal of this endeavour is to test [[CPT symmetry]] through comparison of the [[atomic spectra]] of [[hydrogen]] and antihydrogen (see [[hydrogen spectral series]]).<ref>

In 2016 a new antiproton decelerator and cooler called ELENA (E Low Energy Antiproton decelerator) was built. It takes the antiprotons from the antiproton decelerator and cools them to 90&nbsp;keV, which is \"cold\" enough to study. This machine works by using high energy and accelerating the particles within the chamber. More than one hundred antiprotons can be captured per second, a huge improvement, but it would still take several thousand years to make a [[nanogram]] of antimatter.

Most of the sought-after high-precision tests of the properties of antihydrogen could only be performed if the antihydrogen were trapped, that is, held in place for a relatively long time. While antihydrogen atoms are electrically neutral, the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of their component particles produce a [[magnetic moment]]. These magnetic moments can interact with an inhomogeneous magnetic field; some of the antihydrogen atoms can be attracted to a magnetic minimum. Such a minimum can be created by a combination of mirror and multipole fields.<ref>

===Preservation===
<!--===Antimatter trap===!-->

Antimatter cannot be stored in a container made of ordinary matter because antimatter reacts with any matter it touches, annihilating itself and an equal amount of the container. Antimatter in the form of [[charged particle]]s can be contained by a combination of [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields, in a device called a [[Penning trap]]. This device cannot, however, contain antimatter that consists of uncharged particles, for which [[atomic trap]]s are used. In particular, such a trap may use the [[dipole]] moment ([[Electric dipole moment|electric]] or [[Magnetic moment|magnetic]]) of the trapped particles. At high [[vacuum]], the matter or antimatter particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off-resonant laser radiation using a [[magneto-optical trap]] or [[Magnetic trap (atoms)|magnetic trap]]. Small particles can also be suspended with [[optical tweezers]], using a highly focused laser beam.<ref>

In positive [[beta decay]], a [[nuclide]] loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron (in the same event, a proton becomes a neutron, and a [[neutrino]] is also emitted). Nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a [[cyclotron]] and are widely generated for medical use. Antiprotons have also been shown within laboratory experiments to have the potential to treat certain cancers, in a similar method currently used for ion (proton) therapy.<ref>

The reaction of {{val|1|ul=kg}} of antimatter with {{val|1|u=kg}} of matter would produce {{val|1.8|e=17|ul=J}} (180 petajoules) of energy (by the [[mass–energy equivalence]] formula, {{nowrap|1=''E''=''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}), or the rough equivalent of 43 megatons of TNT – slightly less than the yield of the 27,000&nbsp;kg [[Tsar Bomba]], the largest [[thermonuclear weapon]] ever detonated.

Not all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic propulsion technology because of the nature of the annihilation products. While electron–positron reactions result in gamma ray photons, these are difficult to direct and use for thrust. In reactions between protons and antiprotons, their energy is converted largely into relativistic neutral and charged [[pion]]s. The [[Pion#Neutral pion decays|neutral pions]] decay almost immediately (with a lifetime of 85 [[attoseconds]]) into high-energy photons, but the [[Pion#Charged pion decays|charged pions]] decay more slowly (with a lifetime of 26 nanoseconds) and can be [[Antimatter rocket#Direct use of reaction products|deflected magnetically to produce thrust]].

Charged pions ultimately decay into a combination of [[neutrino]]s (carrying about 22% of the energy of the charged pions) and unstable charged [[muon]]s (carrying about 78% of the charged pion energy), with the muons then decaying into a combination of electrons, positrons and neutrinos (cf. [[muon decay]]; the neutrinos from this decay carry about 2/3 of the energy of the muons, meaning that from the original charged pions, the total fraction of their energy converted to neutrinos by one route or another would be about {{nowrap|1=0.22 + (2/3)⋅0.78=0.74}}).<ref>

For more regular (earthly) applications (for example, regular transport, use in portable generators, powering of cities, ...) artificially created antimatter is not a suitable energy carrier, despite its high energy density, because the process of creating antimatter is extremely inefficient. According to CERN, only one part in ten billion ({{val|e=-10}}) of the energy invested in the production of antimatter particles can be subsequently retrieved.<ref>

Some researchers{{Who|date=May 2012}} claim that with current technology, it is possible to obtain antimatter for [[United States dollar|US$]]25 million per gram by optimizing the collision and collection parameters (given current electricity generation costs).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
Many experts{{Who|date=March 2011}}, however, dispute these claims as being far too optimistic by many orders of magnitude. They point out that, in 2004, the annual production of antiprotons at [[CERN]] was several picograms at a cost of $20 million. This means that to produce 1&nbsp;gram of antimatter, [[CERN]] would need to spend 100 quadrillion ({{val|e=17}}) dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years.

Antimatter production costs, in mass production, are almost linearly tied to electricity costs, so economical pure-antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online unless a very cheap power source is found.

Storage is another problem, as antiprotons are negatively charged and repel each other, so that they cannot be concentrated in a small volume (cf. [[space charge]]). [[Plasma oscillation]]s in the charged cloud of antiprotons can cause instabilities that drive antiprotons out of the storage trap. For these reasons, to date, only a few million antiprotons have been stored simultaneously in a magnetic trap, which corresponds to much less than a femtogram. Antihydrogen atoms or molecules are of neutral charge, they are not as ionically unstable as antiprotons . The drawback is that cold antihydrogen is far more complex to produce than mere antiprotons.

One researcher from the CERN laboratories, which produces antimatter regularly, said:

The local government district of Basildon, which was formed in 1974 and received [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] status in 2010, encapsulates a larger area than the town itself; the two neighbouring towns of Billericay and Wickford, as well as rural villages and smaller settlements set among the surrounding countryside, fall within its borders. Basildon Town is one of the most densely populated areas in the county.

Some of Basildon's residents work in Central London due to the town being well connected in the county to the [[City of London]] and the Docklands financial and corporate headquarters districts, with a 36–58 minute journey from the three Basildon stations to [[Fenchurch Street Station|London Fenchurch Street]].<ref>[http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/planjourney/search Association of Train Operating Companies] National Rail enquiries</ref> Basildon also has access to the City via road, on the A127, and A13.

Railway service started in the 19th century to Pitsea (1856) and Laindon (1888) but it was only later that proposals to provide service to the new town of Basildon, shelved for many years because of concerns that it would simply become a commuter suburb of London, were eventually forced through.

By the beginning of the 1900s, Basildon had evolved with much of the land having been sold in small plots during a period of land speculation and development taking placed haphazardly with building by plot owners ranging from shelters created from recycled materials to brick-built homes and with amenities such as water, gas, electricity and hard-surfaced roads lacking.<ref name=\"EL1108\">{{cite news|title=Once upon a time in ...

[[File:Mayne roads.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic of 'Mayne' roads]]
The two main roads from London to Southend, the [[A13 road (England)|A13]] and [[A127 road|A127]], pass to the south and north of the town respectively. Both are important commuter trunk roads, and also allow easy access to the [[M25 motorway|M25]] and the rest of the motorway network. Locally, the A13 gives access to Pitsea and Vange, and the A127 gives access to [[Basildon town centre|the town centre]] and Laindon.

As part of Basildon's redevelopment [[Essex County Council]] had proposed that the A127 undergo significant development at a cost of £15 million which was expected to be finished by March 2011. It was funded via the [[Community Infrastructure Fund]] (CIF). The project was completed, and was divided into three sections:
* '''Section 1''' – Eastmayne. Implementation of an additional lane northbound (600 metres approx.) and new drainage and footpath realignment.
* '''Section 2''' – Cranes Farm Road. Included dualling of the existing carriageway of which was already there (1500m approx.) and enhancing and upgrading junctions – with the creation of a dedicated left turn lane at the roundabout at Eastmayne to help ease traffic flows during busy hours at the junction.
* '''Section 3''' – Introduction of a new A176 junction at Pipps Hill. This included upgrading the east and westbound off slips to increase the capacity of vehicles and ease traffic flows. The implementation of queue detection and advanced warning signs was also added to this section of the road.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceequal.com/case-studies/basildon-enterprise-corridor/|title=A127 Basildon Enterprise Corridor|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Carillion Civil Engineering|accessdate=21 March 2017}}</ref> Part of section 3 also saw the introduction of the new Hollywood sign for Basildon at the A176 junction.

Basildon was designed with large amounts of green spaces with [[Gloucester Park, Basildon|Gloucester Park]] dominating the centre of Basildon. Kent View Recreation ground in Vange<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.basildon.gov.uk/Website2/newsroom.nsf/0/6CAC167142C3E90E802582A2003DDE63?OpenDocument|title=''In the news:- Kent View Road Recreation Ground gets Fields in Trust protection'' - Basildon Council p.4 June 2018|accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref> and [[Northlands Park, Basildon|Northlands Park]] in [[Pitsea]] are the other large green spaces.

===Heritage===

Even though Basildon is a new town there are still traces of its historical past viewable. Old roads that once connected the villages have been incorporated into the new town – Clay Hill Road, Timberlog Lane, Rectory Road, Pound Lane, Church Road, Dry Street. Dry Street is a perfect example of old Basildon, as it is an undeveloped country lane that runs through One Tree Hill and Langdon Hill Country Parks and is home to several listed properties.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1122258|desc=Thatched Cottage, Dry Street, Basildon |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{NHLE|num=1170028|desc=Rose Cottage, Dry Street, Basildon |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{NHLE|num=1170033|desc=Dry Street Farmhouse, Dry Street, Basildon |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>

Other than St Martin's Church, most of the historical parish churches still exist. St Nicholas (13th century and Grade 1 listed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildon.gov.uk/article/642/Listed-buildings-register|title=Listed buildings register  - Basildon Council|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>) sits proudly over [[Laindon]], from where Basildon can be seen clearly, however St Peter's (13th century Grade II* listed<ref>{{NHLE|num=1122250|desc=Church of St Peter, Basildon |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essexinfo.net/st-peter-s-church-nevendon/|title=St. Peter's Church Nevendon – Home|publisher=}}</ref> at Nevendon is hidden behind Sainsburys and is little known by its residents. St Michael's at Pitsea is said to be 13th century, but was rebuilt in 1870<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildon.com/history/pitsea/pitsea.html|title=Pitsea – The History|publisher=}}</ref> and now only its Bell Tower remains on Pitsea Mount. The village of Basildon's parish church, Holy Cross (Grade II listed<ref>{{NHLE|num=1122252|desc=Church of the Holy Cross, Basildon |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>) can still be seen in Church Road, while Vange's 14th-century church All Saints was remodelled in the 19th century and is set back from the London Road and is Grade II listed.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1122235|desc=Church of All Saints, London Road |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>

Other buildings of note are the Barge Inn at Vange, the Broadway at Pitsea with its mock Tudor architecture built by Harold Howard in 1929, Cromwell Manor (formerly Pitsea Hall Grade II listed<ref>{{NHLE|num=1122236|desc=Pitsea Hall, Basildon |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>) by Pitsea Rail Station that dates from the 15th century and Great Chalvedon Hall (Grade II listed<ref>{{NHLE|num=1305868|desc=Great Chalvedon Hall |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> and now a pub) in Tyefields which is reputed to be 16th century. Nevendon Hall was built in 1789 and is Grade II listed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildon.com/history/chronology/15001799.html|title=Basildon History - A Chronological History|accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{NHLE|num=1170802|desc=Nevendon hall, Basildon|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>

One notable building is Little Coopers Farmhouse which was originally located in Takeley. It was designated a Grade II building in 1980. In the late 1980s due to redevelopment, the whole structure was dismantled and re-built at the Wat Tyler Country Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildon.com/history/chronology/19801989.html|title=Basildon – A Chronological History 1980 – 1989|publisher=|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119092122/http://www.basildon.com/history/chronology/19801989.html|archivedate=19 January 2016}}</ref>

On the west side of town, the [[Dunton Plotlands]] area was occupied by small rural dwellings in the mid twentieth century. Today it forms [[Langdon Nature Reserve]].

In 2008 a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] funded heritage trail was started to highlight the 1960s architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jun/02/heritage.architecture|title=''Oxford, Edinburgh, York ... and Basildon?

St. Martin's Church in Basildon town centre is a modern structure. The church was consecrated in 1962 by the Bishop of Chelmsford.  A freestanding glass Bell Tower was built in 1999 and opened by Her Majesty the Queen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmartinsbasildon.co.uk/around-the-church/|title=St Martins of Tours – Around the Church|publisher=}}</ref>

Although there are a number of tall buildings in central Basildon, there are also many newly constructed buildings closer to the 'Basildon Enterprise Corridor' situated in North Basildon.<ref>[http://www.essex.gov.uk/Environment%20Planning/Planning/Transport-planning/Travel-improvements/Documents/BEC%20Final%20for%20printing.pdf Planning Dept] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913171058/http://www.essex.gov.uk/Environment%20Planning/Planning/Transport-planning/Travel-improvements/Documents/BEC%20Final%20for%20printing.pdf |date=13 September 2014 }}</ref>

The largest structure in the new town's town centre is Brooke House, a 14-story residential tower block that fronts the west side of the town centre's East Square. Dating from 1962, it was designed by Sir Basil Spence and Anthony B Davies, with [[Arup Group Limited|Ove Arup and Partners]] as the structural engineers.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141014004129/http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/default.aspx?pid=2&id=472020 English Heritage, listing information for Brooke House]</ref><ref>http://www.ribapix.com/index.php?a=indexes&s=item&key=IYToxOntpOjA7czo3OiJQaWxvdGlzIjt9&pg=137</ref> It has a 1960s [[Brutalist]] design, elevated on 8 massive V-shaped concrete pylons. The building was chosen to have a residential function, as opposed to commercial office space, to retain life in the town centre after the shops had closed. Shops were positioned to the rear of the building, with Brooke House acting as a covered forecourt. It was conceived as a structure to define Basildon's urban status and to act as marker to identify the town centre's location within a largely low-rise settlement set in a flat landscape.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.basildon.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=4474&p=0 |title=Jennie Humphrey, \"Basildon Town Centre Heritage Assessment\", 2012 |access-date=13 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213819/http://www.basildon.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=4474&p=0 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was named after the then Minister of Housing and Local Government, Henry Brooke MP. The building was given Grade II listing in 1998.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1271497|desc=Brooke House, Basildon |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>

East of Brooke House is East Square, a sunken open-air public plaza accessed from Brooke House by a monumental staircase and a curved ramp which was listed in 1998 as Grade II.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1271498|desc=Retaining Walls, Ramp, Steps, Bench and raised paving |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>  The east side of the square is fronted by Freedom House, containing shops on two levels, and the north side by the Post Office building, a 5-story structure. On a wall of Freedom House is the oldest piece of public sculpture in the new town: installed in 1957, it is a wire and aluminium relief by the sculptor [[John Poole (sculptor)|A. J. Poole]] titled \"Man Aspires\".<ref>\"Our Basildon, exploring past, present and future, heritage trail\", http://www.visitessex.com/discover/cultural/Basildon_Heritage_Trail.aspx</ref><ref>George Thorpe, \"Treble Clef's 54-year secret solved at last\", The Echo, 5 January 2011. [http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/8770053.Treble_Clef___s_54_year_secret_solved_at_last/]</ref> The whole ensemble was designed to create a formal setting for Brooke House, and has a similar Brutalist design, though softened by other architectural features. The town centre extends from East Square towards the south-west. Down the middle of this zone runs a rectangular raised pool. Within the pool is a bronze sculpture and fountain, titled \"Mother and Child\", by the sculptor [[Maurice Lambert]] and dating from 1959<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> which was listed as Grade II in 1998.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1271562|desc=Raised Pool and Sculpture |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>

On the Upper level of Eastgate is the Cats Cradle Pussiwillow III Clock. It was created by [[Rowland Emett]] in 1981 and was originally placed outside what is now ASDA on the Lower Mall of the shopping centre.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/essexrunner/4907817938/ |title=Basildon Eastgate &#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |website=Flickr.com |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref> It was officially unveiled by [[Michael Bentine]].

The Barstable School building first opened on 1 March 1962 and was designed by the Finnish architect Cyril Leonard Sjöström Mardall (of [[Yorke Rosenberg Mardall|YRM Architects]],<ref>[http://www.e-architect.co.uk/architects/yrm.htm YRM]</ref> [[F. R. S. Yorke|Yorke]], Rosenberg and Mardall). The building was listed in 1993 and is Grade II listed.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1235004|desc=Barstable School |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> It is now home to the lower school of the [[Basildon Academies]].

'''Basildon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|z|ᵻ|l|d|ən}} {{respell|BAZ|il|dən}}) is the largest town in the [[borough of Basildon]] with a population of 107,123 in the county of [[Essex]], [[England]].<ref>[http://countyelections.essexcc.gov.uk/MapOfDivisions.asp?DistrictID=7 Countyelections.essexcc.gov.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609021330/http://countyelections.essexcc.gov.uk/MapOfDivisions.asp?DistrictID=7 |date=9 June 2009 }}</ref>

It lies {{convert|26|mi|km|0}} east of [[Central London]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildon.com/ |title=Basildon History Services Information Guide |publisher=Basildon.com |date=24 February 2002 |accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref> {{convert|11|mi|km|0}} south of the city of [[Chelmsford]] and {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} west of [[Southend-on-Sea]]. Nearby smaller towns include [[Billericay]] to the northwest, [[Wickford]] northeast and [[South Benfleet]] to the southeast. It was created as a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new town]] after [[World War II]] in 1948 to accommodate the [[London overspill|London population overspill]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.basildon.com/history/home.html |title=Basildon History Online |publisher=Basildon.com |date=16 July 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817104135/http://www.basildon.com/history/home.html |archive-date=17 August 2009 |url-status = dead}}</ref> from the conglomeration of four small villages, namely [[Pitsea]], [[Laindon]], Basildon (the most central of the four) and [[Vange]].

The local government district of Basildon, which was formed in 1974 and received [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] status in 2010, encapsulates a larger area than the town itself; the two neighbouring towns of Billericay and Wickford, as well as rural villages and smaller settlements set among the surrounding countryside, fall within its borders. Basildon Town is one of the most densely populated areas in the county.

Some of Basildon's residents work in Central London due to the town being well connected in the county to the [[City of London]] and the Docklands financial and corporate headquarters districts, with a 36–58 minute journey from the three Basildon stations to [[Fenchurch Street Station|London Fenchurch Street]].<ref>[http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/planjourney/search Association of Train Operating Companies] National Rail enquiries</ref> Basildon also has access to the City via road, on the A127, and A13.

==History==
{{Further|New towns in the United Kingdom}}
The first historical reference to Basildon is in records from 1086. It is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] as 'Belesduna'.<ref>{{cite web | title = National Archive Summary Record for Basildon | publisher = nationalarchives.gov.uk |date=November 2006 | url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7568162&queryType=1&resultcount=1
| accessdate = 8 November 2006}}</ref> The name 'Basildon' may be derived from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] personal name 'Boerthal' and the Anglo-Saxon word 'dun', meaning hill.<ref name=\"basildon1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.basildon.com/history/basildon/basildon.html |title=The History |publisher=Basildon |date= |accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref> In historical documents, this name had various forms over the centuries, including Berdlesdon, Batlesdon and Belesduna.<ref name=\"basildon1\"/>

Railway service started in the 19th century to Pitsea (1856) and Laindon (1888) but it was only later that proposals to provide service to the new town of Basildon, shelved for many years because of concerns that it would simply become a commuter suburb of London, were eventually forced through. A significant number of modern-day residents do commute to London.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://londondatastore-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/Zho%3Dttw-flows.pdf|title=Commuting in London CIS 2014-11 - GLA Intelligence p.July 2014|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>

By the beginning of the 1900s, Basildon had evolved with much of the land having been sold in small plots during a period of land speculation and development taking placed haphazardly with building by plot owners ranging from shelters created from recycled materials to brick-built homes and with amenities such as water, gas, electricity and hard-surfaced roads lacking.<ref name=\"EL1108\">{{cite news|title=Once upon a time in ...

In the 1940s, [[Basildon Urban District|Billericay Urban District Council]] and [[Essex County Council]], concerned by lack of amenities in the area and by its development, petitioned the Government to create a New Town.<ref name=\"EL1108\" /> Basildon was one of eight 'New Towns' created in the South East of England after the passing of the [[New Towns Act 1946|New Towns Act]].<ref name=\"basildon.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.basildon.com/history/home.html|title=Basildon History Online|publisher=|access-date=6 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817104135/http://www.basildon.com/history/home.html|archive-date=17 August 2009|url-status = dead}}</ref> On 4 January 1949 [[Lewis Silkin]], Minister of Town and Country Planning, officially designated Basildon as a 'New Town'. Basildon Development Corporation was formed in February 1949 to transform the designated area into a modern new town. The New Town incorporated [[Laindon]] and [[Pitsea]]<ref name=\"basildon.com\"/> and was laid out around small neighbourhoods with the first house being completed in June 1951.<ref name=\"EL1108\" /> The first tenants moved into homes in Redgrave Road in Vange.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.basildon.com/history/chronology/19501959.html |title=A Chronological History 1950 – 1959 |publisher=Basildon |date= |accessdate=6 August 2009 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226224844/http://www.basildon.com/history/chronology/19501959.html |archivedate=26 February 2009  }}</ref> A large, illuminated town sign \"Basildon Town Centre Site\" at {{convert|3.5|ft}} was erected in 1956 by the railway and stood until early construction was completed.<ref name=echo/>

==Industry==
Basildon has a heavily developed industrial base. During the construction of the New Town, government grants were given to companies to set up their businesses in Basildon. Amongst the companies that took up these grants were [[Ford Motor Company]] (opened 1964), [[Carreras Tobacco Company]] (1959–1984), [[Yardley of London]] (1966–1998), [[Gordon's Gin]] (1984–1998), [[GEC-Marconi]] (now home to [[Leonardo MW]]).

Basildon has industrial areas situated in Laindon, Cranes Farm Road and Burnt Mills. Cranes Farm Road is currently home to [[CNH Industrial|CNH]] Tractor Plant, formerly owned by Ford.

===Road===
[[File:Mayne roads.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic of 'Mayne' roads]]
The two main roads from London to Southend, the [[A13 road (England)|A13]] and [[A127 road|A127]], pass to the south and north of the town respectively. Both are important commuter trunk roads, and also allow easy access to the [[M25 motorway|M25]] and the rest of the motorway network. Locally, the A13 gives access to Pitsea and Vange, and the A127 gives access to [[Basildon town centre|the town centre]] and Laindon.

Within the town are six main roads which link to and from the A13 and A127; all of them include 'mayne' in their names.

* Nether Mayne runs from the town centre to the A13 at Five Bells junction, just west of Vange.
* Upper Mayne runs from the town centre to the A127 in the northeast corner of Laindon. Both this road and Nether Mayne form part of the A176, which continues north to Billericay.
* South Mayne runs from [[Northlands Park, Basildon|Norhtlands Park]] to the A13 at Pitsea.
* East Mayne runs from Northlands Park to the A127 near Noke Wood. Both this road and South Mayne form part of the A132, which continues north to Wickford.
* Broadmayne runs from the town centre to Northlands Park, connecting the four aforementioned roads. It forms the A1321.
* West Mayne runs from the centre of Laindon to the A127 at [[Dunton Wayletts]]. It forms part of the B148, which continues east from Laindon to Upper Mayne.

===Rail===
The town has three stations on the [[London, Tilbury and Southend Railway|London, Tilbury & Southend Line]]: [[Pitsea railway station|Pitsea]], [[Basildon railway station|Basildon]] and [[Laindon railway station|Laindon]]. All are served by [[c2c]] trains running between [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street]] and [[Southend Central railway station|Southend]]/[[Shoeburyness railway station|Shoeburyness]]; trains serving Basildon and Laindon stations run via [[Upminster station|Upminster]].

===Bus===
Most bus services are provided by [[First Essex]], connecting the town to Billericay, Wickford, and other nearby towns. Other providers are [[Stephensons of Essex]] and [[NIBS Buses]].

As part of Basildon's redevelopment [[Essex County Council]] had proposed that the A127 undergo significant development at a cost of £15 million which was expected to be finished by March 2011. It was funded via the [[Community Infrastructure Fund]] (CIF). The project was completed, and was divided into three sections:
* '''Section 1''' – Eastmayne. Implementation of an additional lane northbound (600 metres approx.) and new drainage and footpath realignment.
* '''Section 2''' – Cranes Farm Road. Included dualling of the existing carriageway of which was already there (1500m approx.) and enhancing and upgrading junctions – with the creation of a dedicated left turn lane at the roundabout at Eastmayne to help ease traffic flows during busy hours at the junction.
* '''Section 3''' – Introduction of a new A176 junction at Pipps Hill. This included upgrading the east and westbound off slips to increase the capacity of vehicles and ease traffic flows. The implementation of queue detection and advanced warning signs was also added to this section of the road.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceequal.com/case-studies/basildon-enterprise-corridor/|title=A127 Basildon Enterprise Corridor|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Carillion Civil Engineering|accessdate=21 March 2017}}</ref> Part of section 3 also saw the introduction of the new Hollywood sign for Basildon at the A176 junction.

Even though Basildon is a new town there are still traces of its historical past viewable. Old roads that once connected the villages have been incorporated into the new town – Clay Hill Road, Timberlog Lane, Rectory Road, Pound Lane, Church Road, Dry Street. Dry Street is a perfect example of old Basildon, as it is an undeveloped country lane that runs through One Tree Hill and Langdon Hill Country Parks and is home to several listed properties.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1122258|desc=Thatched Cottage, Dry Street, Basildon |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{NHLE|num=1170028|desc=Rose Cottage, Dry Street, Basildon |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{NHLE|num=1170033|desc=Dry Street Farmhouse, Dry Street, Basildon |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>

Other than St Martin's Church, most of the historical parish churches still exist. St Nicholas (13th century and Grade 1 listed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildon.gov.uk/article/642/Listed-buildings-register|title=Listed buildings register  - Basildon Council|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>) sits proudly over [[Laindon]], from where Basildon can be seen clearly, however St Peter's (13th century Grade II* listed<ref>{{NHLE|num=1122250|desc=Church of St Peter, Basildon |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essexinfo.net/st-peter-s-church-nevendon/|title=St. Peter's Church Nevendon – Home|publisher=}}</ref> at Nevendon is hidden behind Sainsburys and is little known by its residents.

The village of Basildon's parish church, Holy Cross (Grade II listed<ref>{{NHLE|num=1122252|desc=Church of the Holy Cross, Basildon |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>) can still be seen in Church Road, while Vange's 14th-century church All Saints was remodelled in the 19th century and is set back from the London Road and is Grade II listed.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1122235|desc=Church of All Saints, London Road |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>

Other buildings of note are the Barge Inn at Vange, the Broadway at Pitsea with its mock Tudor architecture built by Harold Howard in 1929, Cromwell Manor (formerly Pitsea Hall Grade II listed<ref>{{NHLE|num=1122236|desc=Pitsea Hall, Basildon |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>) by Pitsea Rail Station that dates from the 15th century and Great Chalvedon Hall (Grade II listed<ref>{{NHLE|num=1305868|desc=Great Chalvedon Hall |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> and now a pub) in Tyefields which is reputed to be 16th century.

One notable building is Little Coopers Farmhouse which was originally located in Takeley. It was designated a Grade II building in 1980. In the late 1980s due to redevelopment, the whole structure was dismantled and re-built at the Wat Tyler Country Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildon.com/history/chronology/19801989.html|title=Basildon – A Chronological History 1980 – 1989|publisher=|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119092122/http://www.basildon.com/history/chronology/19801989.html|archivedate=19 January 2016}}</ref>

On the west side of town, the [[Dunton Plotlands]] area was occupied by small rural dwellings in the mid twentieth century. Today it forms [[Langdon Nature Reserve]].

St. Martin's Church in Basildon town centre is a modern structure. The church was consecrated in 1962 by the Bishop of Chelmsford.  A freestanding glass Bell Tower was built in 1999 and opened by Her Majesty the Queen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmartinsbasildon.co.uk/around-the-church/|title=St Martins of Tours – Around the Church|publisher=}}</ref>

Although there are a number of tall buildings in central Basildon, there are also many newly constructed buildings closer to the 'Basildon Enterprise Corridor' situated in North Basildon.<ref>[http://www.essex.gov.uk/Environment%20Planning/Planning/Transport-planning/Travel-improvements/Documents/BEC%20Final%20for%20printing.pdf Planning Dept] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913171058/http://www.essex.gov.uk/Environment%20Planning/Planning/Transport-planning/Travel-improvements/Documents/BEC%20Final%20for%20printing.pdf |date=13 September 2014 }}</ref>

The largest structure in the new town's town centre is Brooke House, a 14-story residential tower block that fronts the west side of the town centre's East Square. Dating from 1962, it was designed by Sir Basil Spence and Anthony B Davies, with [[Arup Group Limited|Ove Arup and Partners]] as the structural engineers.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141014004129/http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/default.aspx?pid=2&id=472020 English Heritage, listing information for Brooke House]</ref><ref>http://www.ribapix.com/index.php?a=indexes&s=item&key=IYToxOntpOjA7czo3OiJQaWxvdGlzIjt9&pg=137</ref> It has a 1960s [[Brutalist]] design, elevated on 8 massive V-shaped concrete pylons. The building was chosen to have a residential function, as opposed to commercial office space, to retain life in the town centre after the shops had closed. Shops were positioned to the rear of the building, with Brooke House acting as a covered forecourt. It was conceived as a structure to define Basildon's urban status and to act as marker to identify the town centre's location within a largely low-rise settlement set in a flat landscape.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.basildon.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=4474&p=0 |title=Jennie Humphrey, \"Basildon Town Centre Heritage Assessment\", 2012 |access-date=13 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213819/http://www.basildon.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=4474&p=0 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was named after the then Minister of Housing and Local Government, Henry Brooke MP. The building was given Grade II listing in 1998.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1271497|desc=Brooke House, Basildon |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>

East of Brooke House is East Square, a sunken open-air public plaza accessed from Brooke House by a monumental staircase and a curved ramp which was listed in 1998 as Grade II.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1271498|desc=Retaining Walls, Ramp, Steps, Bench and raised paving |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>  The east side of the square is fronted by Freedom House, containing shops on two levels, and the north side by the Post Office building, a 5-story structure. On a wall of Freedom House is the oldest piece of public sculpture in the new town: installed in 1957, it is a wire and aluminium relief by the sculptor [[John Poole (sculptor)|A. J. Poole]] titled \"Man Aspires\".<ref>\"Our Basildon, exploring past, present and future, heritage trail\", http://www.visitessex.com/discover/cultural/Basildon_Heritage_Trail.aspx</ref><ref>George Thorpe, \"Treble Clef's 54-year secret solved at last\", The Echo, 5 January 2011. [http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/8770053.Treble_Clef___s_54_year_secret_solved_at_last/]</ref> The whole ensemble was designed to create a formal setting for Brooke House, and has a similar Brutalist design, though softened by other architectural features. The town centre extends from East Square towards the south-west. Down the middle of this zone runs a rectangular raised pool. Within the pool is a bronze sculpture and fountain, titled \"Mother and Child\", by the sculptor [[Maurice Lambert]] and dating from 1959<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> which was listed as Grade II in 1998.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1271562|desc=Raised Pool and Sculpture |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>

On the Upper level of Eastgate is the Cats Cradle Pussiwillow III Clock. It was created by [[Rowland Emett]] in 1981 and was originally placed outside what is now ASDA on the Lower Mall of the shopping centre.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/essexrunner/4907817938/ |title=Basildon Eastgate &#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |website=Flickr.com |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref> It was officially unveiled by [[Michael Bentine]].

The Barstable School building first opened on 1 March 1962 and was designed by the Finnish architect Cyril Leonard Sjöström Mardall (of [[Yorke Rosenberg Mardall|YRM Architects]],<ref>[http://www.e-architect.co.uk/architects/yrm.htm YRM]</ref> [[F. R. S. Yorke|Yorke]], Rosenberg and Mardall). The building was listed in 1993 and is Grade II listed.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1235004|desc=Barstable School |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> It is now home to the lower school of the [[Basildon Academies]].

[[File:Hermosabeachpier.jpg|thumb|right|The 31st season of ''The Amazing Race'' began on June 10, 2018 at the [[Hermosa Beach Pier]] and nearby beach in [[Hermosa Beach, California]].]]
On June 10, 2018, the show announced on its social media accounts that the ''Race'' had begun filming and that the season's teams would be composed of contestants from [[List of programs broadcast by CBS#Reality / non-scripted|CBS's reality competition programs]].<ref name=\"Instagram\"/> On July 3, 2018, the show concluded in [[Detroit]], which featured a performance of [[The White Stripes]] single \"[[Seven Nation Army]]\" that was originally planned to be set on [[Belle Isle Park (Michigan)|Belle Isle Park]]. However, the permit was denied as the [[Michigan Department of Natural Resources]] had not been informed about the large gathering of musicians needed for filming.

'''Interstate 495''' ('''I-495''') is a {{convert|64|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Interstate Highway]] that surrounds [[Washington, D.C.]], the capital of the [[United States of America]], and its inner suburbs in adjacent [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]]. I-495 is widely known as the '''Capital Beltway''', or simply '''the Beltway''', especially when the context of Washington, D.C., is clear. It is the basis of the phrase \"[[inside the Beltway]]\", used when referring to issues dealing with American [[government]] and [[politics]]. [[Interstate 95|I-95]] utilizes the southern and eastern half of the Capital Beltway to circumnavigate Washington, D.C., and is [[concurrency (road)|cosigned]] with I-495 along that portion.

This [[loop road|circumferential roadway]] is located not only in the states of Virginia and Maryland, but also crosses briefly through the District of Columbia, near the western end of the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]].  The Beltway passes through [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] and [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] in Maryland, and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and the [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] in Virginia.

The [[Cabin John Parkway]], a short connector between I-495 and the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] near the Potomac River along the Maryland–Virginia border, is considered an Interstate [[highway spur|spur]] (I-495X) by the [[Maryland State Highway Administration]].

==Route description==
Except for the westernmost part of Woodrow Wilson Bridge south of downtown Washington (the water below is considered part of the District of Columbia), the Capital Beltway encircles [[Washington, D.C.]], in adjacent [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]]. The two directions of travel, [[clockwise]] and [[counterclockwise]] (looking at a map), have become known respectively as the \"'''Inner Loop'''\" and the \"'''Outer Loop'''\". The route descriptions below follow the direction of the Outer Loop, starting at the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the Potomac River, south of Washington.

[[File:2018-10-31 14 23 17 Signs for Interstate 495 and the Capital Beltway along eastbound U.S. Route 50 (Arlington Boulevard) just west of Virginia State Route 650 (Gallows Road) in Woodburn, Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|120px|left|I-495/Capital Beltway signage in Virginia]]
Most Beltway interchanges provide access to Washington, with [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95]] and [[Interstate 295 (Maryland–District of Columbia)|I-295]] from the south, [[Interstate 66|I-66]] from the west, and [[U.S. Route 50|US 50]] from both the west and the east among the most frequently used. More scenic routes from the Beltway into the District are offered by the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] along the Virginia side of the Potomac, the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] along the Maryland side of the river, and the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]], approaching Washington from the northeast.

Originally, the entire Beltway was simply I-495, and [[Interstate 95|I-95]] was planned to serve downtown Washington, D.C., from the south and north, intersecting the Beltway in Virginia and in Maryland.  However, environmental litigation stopped completion of this plan, and the built portion of I-95 inside the Beltway from the south northward into downtown Washington was redesignated [[Interstate 395 (Virginia–District of Columbia)|I-395]] in 1977.  The small built portion from the north was converted into a park-and-ride lot. I-95 was then rerouted (and so signed) along the eastern side of the Beltway, with the I-495 designation left only along the western side.  In 1989, the I-495 designation was returned to the eastern portion as well, with the highway co-signed as I-95 and I-495 along this route.

===I-95/I-495 concurrency in the District of Columbia===

The Beltway (here I-95 and I-495 together), four lanes in each direction, travels over the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the [[estuary|tidal]] [[Potomac River]] between [[Alexandria, Virginia]], and [[Prince George's County, Maryland]].  The [[Federal Highway Administration]] recognizes {{convert|0.11|mi|km}} of the bridge as crossing the tip of the southernmost corner of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].<ref name=\"FHWA\">{{cite web |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/interstate_highway_system/routefinder/index.cfm |title = Miscellaneous Interstate System Facts |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |date = April 6, 2011 |accessdate = August 28, 2013 |quote = The shortest Interstate route segment is I-95 in the District of Columbia which is 0.11 mile long. }}</ref>  However, signage for these boundary crossings is lacking.

[[File:AnacostiaCapitalBeltway.jpg|thumb|left|I-95/I-495 and I-295 interchange in Maryland seen from the air above the Potomac River (2012)]]
The Beltway (here I-95 and I-495 together) enters [[Maryland]] during its [[Potomac River]] crossing over the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]], west of [[Forest Heights, Maryland|Forest Heights]] and [[National Harbor, Maryland|National Harbor]] as a ten-lane highway with a [[Local–express lanes|local–express lane]] configuration including three local lanes and two express lanes in each direction. After crossing the Potomac, I-95/I-495 narrows to eight lanes with two local and two express lanes in each direction, and immediately meets the southern terminus of [[Interstate 295 (Maryland–District of Columbia)|Interstate 295]], known as the Anacostia Freeway, a route that serves downtown [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to the north, connecting in Washington to [[Interstate 695 (District of Columbia)|Interstate 695]]. This large interchange also connects to National Harbor Boulevard which links the National Harbor with the Beltway and I-295. The highway passes south of [[Oxon Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm]] and next intersects [[Maryland Route 210|MD 210]] (Indian Head Highway) , a major north–south route from southern D.C. to [[Indian Head, Maryland|Indian Head]] in [[Charles County, Maryland]], which also serves the town of Forest Heights to the north at another interconnected interchange.

Heading eastward, the Beltway's (I-95/I-495) local–express lane configuration ends before it interchanges with various local highways, including [[Maryland Route 5|MD 5]] and [[Maryland Route 4|MD 4]] on either side of [[Andrews Air Force Base]], which the Beltway travels near its northern edge. (Both MD 5 and MD 4 extend westward into D.C., and southeastward into [[Southern Maryland]].) Past the MD 4 interchange, the Beltway turns north through [[Glenarden, Maryland|Glenarden]], interchanging with [[Maryland Route 202|MD 202]].

The Beltway then interchanges with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|US 50]]/unsigned [[Interstate 595 (Maryland)|I-595]], a major highway from downtown Washington eastward to [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], Maryland, and the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] to Maryland's [[Eastern Shore, Maryland|Eastern Shore]]. Both US 50 and MD 450 (which interchanges with the Beltway slightly northward) provide access to the New Carrollton [[New Carrollton (Washington Metro)|Metro]], [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail, and [[Amtrak]] stations, and the [[New Carrollton, Maryland|New Carrollton]] area.
[[File:Washington Beltway I-495.jpg|thumb|left|I-495/I-95 Northbound in Maryland, at the Rhode Island Ave. overpass]]

Turning northwest, the Beltway then enters [[Greenbelt Park]], intersecting the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]] (B-W Parkway) in the northeastern edge of the park. Just after the B-W Parkway, I-95/I-495 passes an interchange with [[Maryland Route 201|MD 201]], which connects to the southern terminus of the B-W Parkway at US&nbsp;50 near the D.C. line. Now turned fully west, the Beltway runs through the northern edge of [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]], interchanging with the access roadway for the [[Greenbelt, Maryland|Greenbelt]] [[Greenbelt (Washington Metro)|Metro]] and [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail stations, then [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]].

Beyond the US 1 interchange, I-95 separates from I-495 at the College Park Interchange. I-495 continues west, alone, on the Capital Beltway, while I-95 turns northeast towards [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[New York, New York|New York City]], and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. The interchange includes access to a [[Park and Ride]] lot which was originally paved as part of I-95's route within the Beltway.

===I-495 in Maryland===
Continuing west from the College Park Interchange, I-495 crosses into [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], entering a heavily developed and populated area. Passing underneath [[Maryland Route 212|MD 212]] with no access, the route interchanges with [[Maryland Route 650|MD 650]] near the [[George Washington Cemetery]]. After bisecting [[Northwest Branch Park]], the Beltway interchanges with [[Maryland Route 193|MD 193]] and [[U.S. Route 29 in Maryland|US 29]] south of [[Four Corners, Maryland|Four Corners]]; the two interchanges are little more than 1/2 mile apart. Southbound US 29 is the main route into downtown [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], continuing into Washington.

Squeezing past [[Argyle Park]] and [[Sligo Creek Golf Course]], the Beltway interchanges with [[Maryland Route 97|MD 97]] northwest of Silver Spring, then follows an alignment formerly known as '''Rock Creek Parkway'''.<ref group=lower-alpha>Not the extant parkway in Rock Creek Park within D.C.</ref> The route twists along the alignment, through and around [[Rock Creek Park]], then interchanges with [[Maryland Route 185|MD 185]] near the [[National Naval Medical Center]]. Turning northwest, I-495 soon encounters the southern terminus of [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]], which extends northwestward to meet [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]] in [[Frederick, Maryland]].

[[File:I495 MD 10 2005 165.JPG|left|thumb|I-270/I-495 split (October 2005)]]
I-270 and I-495 split at a highly complex Y-junction, with two separate HOV connections to I-270's HOV lanes and separate ramps to and from [[Maryland Route 355|MD 355]] (formerly [[U.S. Route 240|US 240]]). The old Rock Creek Parkway alignment follows I-270 north, while I-495 turns west and enters the only other six-lane segment of the Beltway still in existence; significant levels of traffic exit onto I-270 north, leaving the six-lane segment west of the split adequate.

Interchanging with Old Georgetown Road ([[Maryland Route 187|MD 187]]), I-495 soon meets the [[Interstate 270 Spur]], the other side of the I-270/I-495 triangle. I-495 joins I-270 Spur at a converging [[Interchange (road)#Full Y interchange|wye]] junction; Inner Loop traffic exits from itself at the southern terminus of I-270 Spur, while Outer Loop traffic crosses the spur and enters it from the right. The two carriageways of I-495 temporarily widen to five lanes each until the [[Maryland Route 190|MD 190]] and [[Cabin John Parkway]] interchanges.  (MD 190 provides access to the northwestern portion of Washington, D.C., and to the [[Potomac, Maryland|Potomac]] and [[Great Falls, Maryland]] areas of Maryland's [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], while the Cabin John Parkway extends to the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] along the Potomac River.)

After these interchanges, the Beltway then narrows to eight lanes again. Turning sharply to the west, I-495 meets the Clara Barton Parkway along the north side of the [[Potomac River]];  this parkway provides a scenic route eastward into the western part of Washington, and westward toward the Potomac River's [[Great Falls (Potomac River)|Great Falls]].  After this interchange, the Beltway soon crosses the [[Mather Gorge|Potomac Gorge]] into [[Virginia]] over the ten-lane [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]].

===I-495 in Virginia===
{{See also|Virginia HOT lanes#495 Express Lanes}}

Immediately after crossing into [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], Virginia, I-495 encounters the western terminus of the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] at a [[trumpet interchange]];  the Parkway provides a scenic route to [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia, and downtown Washington.  The Beltway then continues south, next interchanging with [[Virginia State Route 193|VA 193]] south of [[Dranesville District Park]], then reaches the extensive triangle of interchanges between I-495, the [[Dulles Airport Access Road]], [[Virginia State Route 267|VA 267]], and [[Virginia State Route 123|VA 123]]. The eastbound Dulles Access Road here also provides access to I-66 for Outer Loop Beltway traffic.  The former interchange with the toll road (VA 267) is a directional interchange, while the latter is a cloverleaf; the entire complex occurs east of the [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner]] business district.

Now running south, the Beltway interchanges with [[Virginia State Route 7|VA 7]] (Leesburg Pike) east of Tysons Corner; passing [[Dunn Loring, Virginia|Dunn Loring]] to the east, I-495 soon reaches the complex interchange with [[Interstate 66]], which extends westward to [[I-81]] in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] near [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]], Virginia, and eastward to [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] and downtown Washington. In a similar design as the I-270/I-495 interchange, dedicated HOV connections exist between I-495 and I-66, with many reversible and other directional ramps providing the remaining connections. There is no access between the Outer Loop and eastbound I-66 at this interchange. Instead, Outer Loop traffic must use the eastbound [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] exit 3 miles (5&nbsp;km) to the north in order to reach I-66 East.<ref group=lower-alpha>If a driver gets onto westbound I-66 at the Leesburg Pike (SR&nbsp;7) entrance, the only choice for getting to northbound I-495 is to take I-66 west to the Nutley Street exit and then get on I-66 east. A similar situation occurs for going from the [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] at Chain Bridge Road ([[Virginia State Route 123|SR&nbsp;123]]) to southbound I-495, where it is assumed that the driver will know to continue along SR&nbsp;7 or SR&nbsp;123 directly to the Beltway.</ref> There are multiple ramps from I-66 east to the Inner Loop, with one ramp exiting from the left side of I-66 east and the other exiting from the right. The [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] leads to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]], which then changes over to the [[Dulles Greenway]] and ends at [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]].

South of the I-66 interchange, the Beltway crosses under [[U.S. Route 29 in Virginia|US 29]] and [[Virginia State Route 237|VA 237]] with no access, then encounters a large braided interchange between I-495, [[U.S. Route 50 in Virginia|US 50]], and two local roads; the direct interchange between I-495 and US 50 is a full cloverleaf, while the braided local interchanges between I-495, US 50, and the local roads are modified [[SPUI]]s. The entire complex is bounded on the northeast side by Fairview Lake and on the southwest side by an office complex.

Continuing due south, the route then interchanges with Gallows Road, then skirts the eastern edge of [[Mill Creek Park (Virginia)|Mill Creek Park]] before interchanging with [[Virginia State Route 236|VA 236]] southwest of [[Annandale Community Park]]. Running along the eastern edge of [[Wakefield Park (Annandale, Virginia)|Wakefield Park]], the Beltway turns southeast and interchanges with [[State Route 620 (Fairfax County, Virginia)|VA 620]] before turning east near [[Flag Run Park]] and entering [[Springfield, Virginia|Springfield]], meeting the [[Springfield Interchange]] with I-95 southeast of the [[Shirley Industrial Complex]].

===I-95/I-495 concurrency in Virginia===

I-95 joins the Beltway within the [[Springfield Interchange]]. I-495 also meets the southern terminus of [[Interstate 395 (Virginia)|Interstate 395]] within the same massive interchange complex.
[[File:Capital Beltway from Metro bridge.jpg|thumb|left|I-95/I-495 in Alexandria, seen from the [[Yellow Line (Washington Metro)|Yellow Line]] of the [[Washington Metro]]]]
Running due east away from the interchange, crossing to the south of [[Backlick Stream Valley Park]], the Beltway (now I-95/I495) interchanges with [[State Route 613 (Fairfax County, Virginia)|VA 613]] a mile east of the Springfield Interchange. Continuing east, the Beltway encounters a diamond interchange with a connector road linking to Eisenhower Avenue, which parallels the Beltway for a short distance. Skirting the northern edges of [[Loftridge Park]] and [[Burgundy Park]] the two routes enter [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] and soon reach [[Virginia State Route 241|VA 241]], a direct route into the city, currently under major reconstruction. Within the interchange, the Beltway nears the western approach to the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge.

A short stretch of the bridge just before this sign is in the [[District of Columbia]].]]
Continuing east the two routes encounter [[U.S. Route 1 in Virginia|US 1]], a major north-south highway providing access to Alexandria, [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] and downtown Washington, as well as various points south in [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], Virginia. Finally, beyond this complex interchange, I-95 and I-495 together cross Alexandria's  [[Jones Point Park]] and exit Virginia via the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]].

==History==
The idea of building a highway around the Washington suburbs had been discussed at least since 1944, when Fred W. Tummler, director of planning of the [[National Capital Planning Commission|National Capital Park and Planning Commission]], proposed an Inter-County Metropolitan Freeway.<ref>{{cite news |title = Express Highway System Plans Revealed for Md.-Capital Area |date = November 21, 1944 |first = Betty |last = McDevitt |work = The Washington Post |page = 1 |issn = 0190-8286 |id = {{ProQuest|151705862}} }} {{subscription required}}</ref> The [[Senate Public Works Committee]] backed the idea of building the highway in 1951, asking the Public Roads Bureau to prepare plans for the highway.<ref name=askplan>{{cite news |title = Senators Ask Plan for D.C.

The first section of the {{convert|64|mi|km|adj=on}} long Beltway (including the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge|Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]]) was opened on December 21, 1961; the highway was completed on August 17, 1964.

Originally designated I-495, in 1977 the eastern portion of the Beltway was re-designated [[Interstate 95|I-95]] when a proposed alignment of I-95 from [[New York Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|New York Avenue]] in Washington, D.C., through [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] to I-495 was canceled. Motorists never fully adjusted to the two halves of the Beltway having different numbers. According to Ron Shaffer of the ''Washington Post'',

{{quote|There were signs stating that to continue on the Beltway, you had to get off at the next exit, when all you really had to do was keep going straight. Lots of resistance from bureaucrats, but eventually we got dual I-95/I-495 signs on the eastern half of the Beltway.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/24/AR2006062400980.html |work = The Washington Post |title = After 20 Years of Columns, Checking the Rearview Mirror One Last Time |first = Ron |last = Shaffer |date = June 25, 2006 |accessdate = May 5, 2010 |issn = 0190-8286 }}</ref>}}

In 1989, the I-495 designation was restored to the eastern portion, making it a dual I-95/I-495.<ref>{{AASHTO minutes |year= 1991S}}</ref>

Traveling clockwise, the Beltway is designated as the \"[[Inner/Outer labeling|Inner Loop]]\"; traveling counter-clockwise, it is designated as the \"[[Inner/Outer labeling|Outer Loop]]\". This parlance too has led to its own confusion, with unfamiliar motorists imagining two separate, distinct highway alignments, one some distance inside the other. At entrance ramps to the Beltway and on the on-highway signage, \"Inner Loop\" and \"Outer Loop\" shields are posted in conjunction with the route marker shields, although the terms are not emphasized in signage.

The Beltway was originally envisioned as primarily a bypass for long-distance eastern seaboard traffic to avoid driving directly through Washington. However, the explosive growth both of housing and business in the Washington suburbs following the Beltway's completion quickly made the Beltway the area's \"main street\" for local traffic as well. Numerous large shopping malls, community colleges, sports and concert stadiums, and corporate employment centers were purposely built adjacent to the Beltway, and these added greatly to the traffic, as has the passenger growth of regional airports accessed by the Beltway. The formerly more affordable price of housing in Southern Maryland versus [[Northern Virginia]], also led tens of thousands of commuters to live in Southern Maryland and commute on the Beltway to Virginia. The newer [[Fairfax County Parkway]] in the 1990s helped ease some traffic on the Virginia beltway; however, various proposals to build another complete [[Washington Outer Beltway|outer beltway]] in the outer suburbs has not gotten off the ground, because local governments in Maryland object to building additional [[Potomac River]] crossings as well as destroying protected \"open space\" and creating [[suburban sprawl|sprawl]].

===College Park Interchange===
[[File:College Park Interchange.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of the College Park Interchange]]
[[File:2019-06-03 11 53 32 View north along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway at the split between Interstate 95 North towards Baltimore and Interstate 495 West towards Silver Spring in Beltsville, Prince Georges County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|The I-95/I-495 split at College Park, Maryland]]
The College Park Interchange is the informal name for the northern interchange between I-95 and I-495 in College Park. The interchange was partially opened, along with the connecting segment of I-95, in 1971, completing I-95 between the Baltimore Beltway and the Capital Beltway. As originally planned, it was designed with the idea that mainline I-95 through traffic would continue straight through the interchange and south into [[Washington D.C.]] as the [[Northeast Freeway (Washington, D.C.)|Northeast Freeway]], joining the [[North Central Freeway (Washington, D.C.)|North Central Freeway]] within D.C. and running south towards the central business district. When the D.C. government canceled its segment of I-95 in 1977, I-95 was rerouted onto the eastern half of the Capital Beltway, which lost its designation as I-495 (this was restored in 1989, forming a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] of I-95 and I-495 on the eastern half). As a result of this rerouting, the interchange was placed under considerable pressure to cater for a traffic flow that it was not designed to handle.

Originally, travelers from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop had to traverse the one-lane cloverleaf ramp in the southwest quadrant of the interchange; after exiting the ramp, traffic then had to weave through Inner Loop traffic headed for [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]]. This unsafe condition was rectified by November 1986, when the flyover from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop was constructed for I-95 southbound through traffic; the existing one-lane cloverleaf ramp was retained for access to the new C-D lane on the Inner Loop within the US 1 interchange, to segregate through traffic from southbound I-95 and local traffic for US 1. The stump end of the interchange was also modified into its present configuration, and the [[Park and Ride]] was built.

===Traffic congestion===
Despite numerous widening projects during its history, heavy traffic on the Beltway is a continuing problem. The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]]—where eight lanes were squeezed into six—was particularly onerous, with miles-long backups daily during commuter rush hours and on heavily traveled weekends. Relief for this bottleneck came on May 30, 2008, when the 12-lane replacement bridge opened to traffic in both directions (the six-lane span carrying Outer Loop traffic had opened in June 2006). Two of the lanes on the Wilson are being held in reserve  for future use as bus rapid transit or rail transit.

[[File:2019-05-29 17 54 50 View south along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) at Exit 57A (Interstate 95 South, Richmond) along the edge of North Springfield and Springfield in Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|left|View south along I-495 approaching the Springfield Interchange in Springfield, Virginia]]
Two intersections on the Capital Beltway are ranked in the top 20 on a study of the \"worst bottlenecks in the nation.\" They are the I-495 at [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|I-270]] interchange in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], ranked third overall, which receives 760,425 cars daily, and the College Park Interchange in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], ranked 11th, with 340,125 cars. The [[Springfield Interchange]], where [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|I-395]], I-95, and I-495 meet, was previously ranked fifth worst in the nation, but recent improvements have taken it off the top 20. Local commuters refer to the Springfield Interchange as \"The Mixing Bowl,\" although this designation is reserved by highway officials for the even more complicated [[Pentagon road network|interchange]] complex adjacent to [[The Pentagon]] on the original [[Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway]] (currently better-known as [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]]) at [[Virginia State Route 27|State Route 27]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]].

In April 2005, the [[Virginia Department of Transportation]] signed an agreement with two private companies to build [[high-occupancy toll]] lanes on the stretch of the Beltway between Springfield and Georgetown Pike.  Construction began in 2008. Maryland officials are considering such lanes on their segment of the Beltway, as well as other major commuter highways in the state. Locals who disapprove of these projects have nicknamed them \"[[Lexus]] Lanes\" because of the potential high price for using the lanes in exchange for bypassing congestion. These new lanes are one stage of a controversial project to widen the beltway, with the second stage involving widening the beltway to 12 lanes; opponents have called for various alternatives to this project (as well as the controversial [[Maryland Route 200|Intercounty Connector]] project) which would divert many vehicles off the northern beltway. The [[Maryland Transit Administration]]'s proposed [[Purple Line (Maryland)|Purple Line]] light rail transit line is just one example.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.smartergrowth.net/issues/transportation/roads/beltway/index.html |title = The Beltway |publisher = Coalition for Smarter Growth |accessdate = August 24, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091220004753/http://www.smartergrowth.net/issues/transportation/roads/beltway/index.html |archive-date = December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

The Beltway has been improved since it opened. The American Legion Bridge was expanded by two lanes. HOV lanes were added between River Road and the I-270 Spur in Montgomery County, Maryland. The interchange between I-95 and the Beltway in Prince George's County, Maryland was originally designed to be a cloverleaf to allow I-95 to extend southward toward the District of Columbia. After I-95 was realigned onto the Beltway, a flyover ramp was built to allow I-95 through traffic to have two high-speed lanes. The interchange between U.S. Route 50 and I-95/I-495 in Prince George's County, Maryland was upgraded from a simple cloverleaf to a hybrid turbine interchange. In the Beltway's original configuration, I-295 and Indian Head Highway had separate interchanges. As a result, north-south traffic between I-295 and Indian Head Highway was forced to merge onto a congested section of the Beltway for approximately one mile. As a congestion relief measure, I-295 was extended over the Beltway and continued parallel to it so that the two highways were directly connected independent of the beltway. However, these interchanges were redesigned and rebuilt to accommodate the expansion of the Wilson Bridge and the construction of dedicated ramps to National Harbor.

In January 2018, Maryland State Democratic Sen. [[Joanne C. Benson|Joanne Benson]] of Prince George's County proposed legislation (Senate Bill 55) to increase the speed limit of the Maryland section of the Beltway from 55 to 70&nbsp;mph, in a bid to reduce traffic congestion on the Beltway.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://wtop.com/dc-transit/2018/01/hit-the-gas-md-lawmaker-wants-to-up-speed-limits-on-i-495-i-270/ |title = Hit the gas: Md. lawmaker wants to up speed limits on Capital Beltway, I-270 |date = January 19, 2018 |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[WTOP-FM]] |access-date = January 22, 2018 |language = en-US }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Maryland-Proposal-Boost-Beltway-I-270-Speed-Limits-70-Mph-470205523.html |title = Proposal Would Boost Beltway, I-270 Speed Limits to 70 Mph |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[WRC-TV]] |access-date = January 22, 2018 |language = en }}</ref>

===Current roadworks===
[[File:Woodrow wilson bridge june06.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] under reconstruction, June 2006]]
The [[Springfield Interchange]] in Virginia completed reconstruction in 2007.  The eight-year, nearly $676 million project worked to eliminate weaving among local and long-distance traffic between I-95, I-395, the Beltway, and [[Virginia State Route 644 (Fairfax County)|State Route 644]].

The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] underwent reconstruction in a major project that began in 1999; it now provides express and local lanes for both the Inner and Outer Loops. The new Wilson Bridge is higher and wider than the original 1961 span, which was demolished in 2006. The Outer Loop span opened in June 2006, and the Inner Loop span opened in May 2008.

Also, in association with the Wilson Bridge project, the [[Virginia State Route 241|Telegraph Road]] and [[U.S. 1]] interchanges (exits 176 and 177) in Alexandria, Virginia were rebuilt. The [[Interstate 295 (Maryland)|I-295]] and [[Maryland Route 210|MD 210]]  interchanges (exits 2 and 3) in Maryland were rebuilt as well. These improvement lasted through 2013.

The Branch Avenue ([[Maryland Route 5]]) Interchange was also improved.

===Virginia HOT lanes===
{{main|Virginia HOT lanes}}

At the left is the elevated ramp to access the HOT lanes from Route 123 via Westpark Drive (Tysons Corner). In the background is the [[Silver Line (Washington Metro)|Silver Line]] viaduct.]]
The [[Virginia Department of Transportation]] authorized a [[public-private partnership]] to construct [[high-occupancy toll]] (HOT) lanes in Northern Virginia. The project added two lanes to I-495 in each direction from just west of the Springfield Interchange to just north of the [[Dulles Toll Road]], and included the replacement of more than 50 bridges, overpasses, and major interchanges.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://virginiahotlanes.com/ |title = Virginia HOT Lanes |publisher = Fluor-Transurban |accessdate = December 8, 2008 |archive-url = https://archive.is/20120527034614/http://virginiahotlanes.com/ |archive-date = May 27, 2012 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

Drivers of vehicles with fewer than three occupants are required to pay a toll to use the lanes.  Tolls change dynamically, with higher tolls charged during periods of heaviest congestion.  Drivers using the HOT Lanes are required to carry an [[E-ZPass]] transponder to allow [[electronic toll collection]], eliminating the need for toll booths.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://virginiahotlanes.com/beltway/how-hot-lanes-work/ |title = How HOT Lanes Work |publisher = Fluor-Transurban |accessdate = May 29, 2011 |archive-url = https://archive.is/20101129082531/http://virginiahotlanes.com/beltway/how-hot-lanes-work/ |archive-date = November 29, 2010 |url-status = dead }}</ref> Tolls are waived for buses, carpools of at least three people, motorcycles, and emergency vehicles with an E-ZPass Flex transponder set to the \"HOV ON\" configuration. If more than a specified number of carpools or buses use the lanes, Virginia must pay the tolls for the excess vehicles.

At the north and south terminal of the HOT lanes, motorists are able to transition directly between the HOT lanes and the I-495 general purpose lanes.  However, elsewhere along the corridor, access to and from the HOT lanes is only permitted from cross roads.  Some cross roads provide access to both HOT lanes and general purpose lanes; others have access only to one system or the other.  Many HOT lane access points serve traffic in only one direction of I-495, which is intended to complement typical commuting patterns.  HOT lane interchanges are as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url = http://virginiahotlanes.com/beltway/project-info/ |title = Virginia HOT Lanes Project Info |publisher = Fluor-Transurban |accessdate = September 30, 2010 |archive-url = https://archive.is/20120716085216/http://virginiahotlanes.com/beltway/project-info/ |archive-date = July 16, 2012 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

The original scope of the HOT project is covered by a fixed-price $1.3 billion contract between concessionaire Capital Beltway Express LLC and contractor [[Fluor Corporation|Fluor-Lane LLC]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.virginiahotlanes.com/uploads/1000/346-DBCExecutionCopy.pdf |title = Turnkey Lump-sum Design-Build Contract |accessdate = December 23, 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101221235237/http://virginiahotlanes.com/uploads/1000/346-DBCExecutionCopy.pdf |archive-date = December 21, 2010 |url-status = dead }}</ref> The partnership has proposed extending the scope of the project to north to the Potomac River.

In 2004, [[Transurban|Transurban (USA) Development Inc.]] joined the Fluor team to serve as concessionaire and long-term operator of the HOT lanes.  After a competitive procurement, the team was selected to deliver and operate the new HOT lanes.  After a series of public meetings and environmental studies, the project was approved and funded in 2007. Construction began in the summer of 2008. The Express Lanes were opened for public access on November 17, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.495expresslanes.com/project-background |title = Project Background |accessdate = October 15, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120926161142/https://www.495expresslanes.com/project-background |archive-date = September 26, 2012 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

In September 2017, Governor [[Larry Hogan]] announced a plan to widen the portion of I-495 in Maryland by four lanes, adding [[express toll lane]]s to the median, as part of an $11+ billion proposal to widen roads in Maryland. The project would be a public-private partnership with private companies responsible for constructing, operating, and maintaining the lanes.<ref name=wtop>{{cite web |url = http://wtop.com/maryland/2017/09/hogan-proposes-9b-plan-add-new-lanes-beltway-270-bw-parkway/ |title = Hogan proposes $9B plan to add new lanes to Beltway, 270 and BW Parkway |date = September 21, 2017 |publisher = WTOP-FM |location = Washington, DC |accessdate = September 21, 2017 }}</ref> On June 5, 2019, the Maryland Board of Public Works voted 2–1 in favor of the proposal to construct express toll lanes along I-495, with Governor Hogan and State Comptroller [[Peter Franchot]] voting for it and State Treasurer [[Nancy Kopp]] voting against it.

===Exit numbering===
Exit numbers on the Beltway have gone through several iterations.  Originally, all exits on the Beltway were numbered sequentially in a clockwise direction, starting with exit 1 for US 1 in Alexandria. After the eastern half of the Beltway was renumbered in 1977 as [[Interstate 95]], exits on the Maryland portion were renumbered to the current format, counterclockwise with exit numbers assigned to mileposts.  This caused problems because there were some exits that had the same number in Maryland and Virginia.  Around 2000, this problem was solved by renumbering all of the Virginia exits. The exit numbers between the [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]] and the [[Springfield Interchange]]—Interstate 495's intersection with [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]] and [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95 in Virginia]]—became a continuation of the Maryland exit numbers from the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] to the [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]]. The exit numbers between the [[Springfield Interchange]] and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge became a continuation of the exit numbers of I-95 in Virginia; such exit numbers are much higher than those on the rest of the Beltway, but continue to increase in the counterclockwise direction. The counterclockwise numbering on the Capital Beltway is a rarity, as most similar loop highways, like the [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|Baltimore Beltway]], have their exit numbers/mileage set in a clockwise arrangement.

==Exit list==
===Mainline===
The Commonwealth of Virginia formerly reset exit numbers at state lines, and numbered them from the counterclockwise end to the clockwise end.{{jcttop|old|state_col=State|old_ref=<ref>{{cite map |author = [[H.M.

'''Interstate 495''' ('''I-495''') is a {{convert|64|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Interstate Highway]] that surrounds [[Washington, D.C.]], the capital of the [[United States of America]], and its inner suburbs in adjacent [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]]. I-495 is widely known as the '''Capital Beltway''', or simply '''the Beltway''', especially when the context of Washington, D.C., is clear. It is the basis of the phrase \"[[inside the Beltway]]\", used when referring to issues dealing with American [[government]] and [[politics]]. [[Interstate 95|I-95]] utilizes the southern and eastern half of the Capital Beltway to circumnavigate Washington, D.C., and is [[concurrency (road)|cosigned]] with I-495 along that portion.

This [[loop road|circumferential roadway]] is located not only in the states of Virginia and Maryland, but also crosses briefly through the District of Columbia, near the western end of the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]].  The Beltway passes through [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] and [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] in Maryland, and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and the [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] in Virginia.

The [[Cabin John Parkway]], a short connector between I-495 and the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] near the Potomac River along the Maryland–Virginia border, is considered an Interstate [[highway spur|spur]] (I-495X) by the [[Maryland State Highway Administration]].

==Route description==
Except for the westernmost part of Woodrow Wilson Bridge south of downtown Washington (the water below is considered part of the District of Columbia), the Capital Beltway encircles [[Washington, D.C.]], in adjacent [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]]. The two directions of travel, [[clockwise]] and [[counterclockwise]] (looking at a map), have become known respectively as the \"'''Inner Loop'''\" and the \"'''Outer Loop'''\". The route descriptions below follow the direction of the Outer Loop, starting at the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the Potomac River, south of Washington.

[[File:2018-10-31 14 23 17 Signs for Interstate 495 and the Capital Beltway along eastbound U.S. Route 50 (Arlington Boulevard) just west of Virginia State Route 650 (Gallows Road) in Woodburn, Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|120px|left|I-495/Capital Beltway signage in Virginia]]
Most Beltway interchanges provide access to Washington, with [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95]] and [[Interstate 295 (Maryland–District of Columbia)|I-295]] from the south, [[Interstate 66|I-66]] from the west, and [[U.S. Route 50|US 50]] from both the west and the east among the most frequently used. More scenic routes from the Beltway into the District are offered by the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] along the Virginia side of the Potomac, the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] along the Maryland side of the river, and the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]], approaching Washington from the northeast.

Originally, the entire Beltway was simply I-495, and [[Interstate 95|I-95]] was planned to serve downtown Washington, D.C., from the south and north, intersecting the Beltway in Virginia and in Maryland.  However, environmental litigation stopped completion of this plan, and the built portion of I-95 inside the Beltway from the south northward into downtown Washington was redesignated [[Interstate 395 (Virginia–District of Columbia)|I-395]] in 1977.  The small built portion from the north was converted into a park-and-ride lot. I-95 was then rerouted (and so signed) along the eastern side of the Beltway, with the I-495 designation left only along the western side.  In 1989, the I-495 designation was returned to the eastern portion as well, with the highway co-signed as I-95 and I-495 along this route.

The Beltway (here I-95 and I-495 together), four lanes in each direction, travels over the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the [[estuary|tidal]] [[Potomac River]] between [[Alexandria, Virginia]], and [[Prince George's County, Maryland]].

[[File:AnacostiaCapitalBeltway.jpg|thumb|left|I-95/I-495 and I-295 interchange in Maryland seen from the air above the Potomac River (2012)]]
The Beltway (here I-95 and I-495 together) enters [[Maryland]] during its [[Potomac River]] crossing over the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]], west of [[Forest Heights, Maryland|Forest Heights]] and [[National Harbor, Maryland|National Harbor]] as a ten-lane highway with a [[Local–express lanes|local–express lane]] configuration including three local lanes and two express lanes in each direction.  After crossing the Potomac, I-95/I-495 narrows to eight lanes with two local and two express lanes in each direction, and immediately meets the southern terminus of [[Interstate 295 (Maryland–District of Columbia)|Interstate 295]], known as the [[Anacostia]] Freeway, a route that serves downtown [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to the north, connecting in Washington to [[Interstate 695 (District of Columbia)|Interstate 695]]. This large interchange also connects to National Harbor Boulevard which links the National Harbor with the Beltway and I-295. The highway passes south of [[Oxon Cove Park & Oxon Hill Farm]] and next intersects [[Maryland Route 210|MD 210]] (Indian Head Highway) , a major north–south route from southern D.C. to [[Indian Head, Maryland|Indian Head]] in [[Charles County, Maryland]], which also serves the town of Forest Heights to the north at another interconnected interchange.

Heading eastward, the Beltway's (I-95/I-495) local–express lane configuration ends before it interchanges with various local highways, including [[Maryland Route 5|MD 5]] and [[Maryland Route 4|MD 4]] on either side of [[Andrews Air Force Base]], which the Beltway travels near its northern edge. (Both MD 5 and MD 4 extend westward into D.C., and southeastward into [[Southern Maryland]].)  Past the MD 4 interchange, the Beltway turns north through [[Glenarden, Maryland|Glenarden]], interchanging with [[Maryland Route 202|MD 202]].

The Beltway then interchanges with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|US 50]]/unsigned [[Interstate 595 (Maryland)|I-595]], a major highway from downtown Washington eastward to [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], Maryland, and the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] to Maryland's [[Eastern Shore, Maryland|Eastern Shore]].  Both US 50 and MD 450 (which interchanges with the Beltway slightly northward) provide access to the New Carrollton [[New Carrollton (Washington Metro)|Metro]], [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail, and [[Amtrak]] stations, and the [[New Carrollton, Maryland|New Carrollton]] area.
[[File:Washington Beltway I-495.jpg|thumb|left|I-495/I-95 Northbound in Maryland, at the Rhode Island Ave. overpass]]

Turning northwest, the Beltway then enters [[Greenbelt Park]], intersecting the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]] (B-W Parkway) in the northeastern edge of the park. Just after the B-W Parkway, I-95/I-495 passes an interchange with [[Maryland Route 201|MD 201]], which connects to the southern terminus of the B-W Parkway at US&nbsp;50 near the D.C. line. Now turned fully west, the Beltway runs through the northern edge of [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]], interchanging with the access roadway for the [[Greenbelt, Maryland|Greenbelt]] [[Greenbelt (Washington Metro)|Metro]] and [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail stations, then [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]].

Beyond the US 1 interchange, I-95 separates from I-495 at the College Park Interchange. I-495 continues west, alone, on the Capital Beltway, while I-95 turns northeast towards [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[New York, New York|New York City]], and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. The interchange includes access to a [[Park and Ride]] lot which was originally paved as part of I-95's route within the Beltway.

===I-495 in Maryland===
Continuing west from the College Park Interchange, I-495 crosses into [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], entering a heavily developed and populated area. Passing underneath [[Maryland Route 212|MD 212]] with no access, the route interchanges with [[Maryland Route 650|MD 650]] near the [[George Washington Cemetery]]. After bisecting [[Northwest Branch Park]], the Beltway interchanges with [[Maryland Route 193|MD 193]] and [[U.S. Route 29 in Maryland|US 29]] south of [[Four Corners, Maryland|Four Corners]]; the two interchanges are little more than 1/2 mile apart. Southbound US 29 is the main route into downtown [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], continuing into Washington.

Squeezing past [[Argyle Park]] and [[Sligo Creek Golf Course]], the Beltway interchanges with [[Maryland Route 97|MD 97]] northwest of Silver Spring, then follows an alignment formerly known as '''Rock Creek Parkway'''.<ref group=lower-alpha>Not the extant parkway in Rock Creek Park within D.C.</ref> The route twists along the alignment, through and around [[Rock Creek Park]], then interchanges with [[Maryland Route 185|MD 185]] near the [[National Naval Medical Center]]. Turning northwest, I-495 soon encounters the southern terminus of [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]], which extends northwestward to meet [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]] in [[Frederick, Maryland]].

[[File:I495 MD 10 2005 165.JPG|left|thumb|I-270/I-495 split (October 2005)]]
I-270 and I-495 split at a highly complex Y-junction, with two separate HOV connections to I-270's HOV lanes and separate ramps to and from [[Maryland Route 355|MD 355]] (formerly [[U.S. Route 240|US 240]]). The old Rock Creek Parkway alignment follows I-270 north, while I-495 turns west and enters the only other six-lane segment of the Beltway still in existence; significant levels of traffic exit onto I-270 north, leaving the six-lane segment west of the split adequate.

Interchanging with Old Georgetown Road ([[Maryland Route 187|MD 187]]), I-495 soon meets the [[Interstate 270 Spur]], the other side of the I-270/I-495 triangle. I-495 joins I-270 Spur at a converging [[Interchange (road)#Full Y interchange|wye]] junction; Inner Loop traffic exits from itself at the southern terminus of I-270 Spur, while Outer Loop traffic crosses the spur and enters it from the right. The two carriageways of I-495 temporarily widen to five lanes each until the [[Maryland Route 190|MD 190]] and [[Cabin John Parkway]] interchanges.  (MD 190 provides access to the northwestern portion of Washington, D.C., and to the [[Potomac, Maryland|Potomac]] and [[Great Falls, Maryland]] areas of Maryland's [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], while the Cabin John Parkway extends to the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] along the Potomac River.)

After these interchanges, the Beltway then narrows to eight lanes again. Turning sharply to the west, I-495 meets the Clara Barton Parkway along the north side of the [[Potomac River]];  this parkway provides a scenic route eastward into the western part of Washington, and westward toward the Potomac River's [[Great Falls (Potomac River)|Great Falls]].  After this interchange, the Beltway soon crosses the [[Mather Gorge|Potomac Gorge]] into [[Virginia]] over the ten-lane [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]].

===I-495 in Virginia===
{{See also|Virginia HOT lanes#495 Express Lanes}}

Immediately after crossing into [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], Virginia, I-495 encounters the western terminus of the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] at a [[trumpet interchange]];  the Parkway provides a scenic route to [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia, and downtown Washington.  The Beltway then continues south, next interchanging with [[Virginia State Route 193|VA 193]] south of [[Dranesville District Park]], then reaches the extensive triangle of interchanges between I-495, the [[Dulles Airport Access Road]], [[Virginia State Route 267|VA 267]], and [[Virginia State Route 123|VA 123]]. The eastbound Dulles Access Road here also provides access to I-66 for Outer Loop Beltway traffic.  The former interchange with the toll road (VA 267) is a directional interchange, while the latter is a cloverleaf; the entire complex occurs east of the [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner]] business district.

Now running south, the Beltway interchanges with [[Virginia State Route 7|VA 7]] (Leesburg Pike) east of Tysons Corner; passing [[Dunn Loring, Virginia|Dunn Loring]] to the east, I-495 soon reaches the complex interchange with [[Interstate 66]], which extends westward to [[I-81]] in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] near [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]], Virginia, and eastward to [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] and downtown Washington. In a similar design as the I-270/I-495 interchange, dedicated HOV connections exist between I-495 and I-66, with many reversible and other directional ramps providing the remaining connections. There is no access between the Outer Loop and eastbound I-66 at this interchange. Instead, Outer Loop traffic must use the eastbound [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] exit 3 miles (5&nbsp;km) to the north in order to reach I-66 East.<ref group=lower-alpha>If a driver gets onto westbound I-66 at the Leesburg Pike (SR&nbsp;7) entrance, the only choice for getting to northbound I-495 is to take I-66 west to the Nutley Street exit and then get on I-66 east. A similar situation occurs for going from the [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] at Chain Bridge Road ([[Virginia State Route 123|SR&nbsp;123]]) to southbound I-495, where it is assumed that the driver will know to continue along SR&nbsp;7 or SR&nbsp;123 directly to the Beltway.</ref> There are multiple ramps from I-66 east to the Inner Loop, with one ramp exiting from the left side of I-66 east and the other exiting from the right. The [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] leads to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]], which then changes over to the [[Dulles Greenway]] and ends at [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]].

South of the I-66 interchange, the Beltway crosses under [[U.S. Route 29 in Virginia|US 29]] and [[Virginia State Route 237|VA 237]] with no access, then encounters a large braided interchange between I-495, [[U.S. Route 50 in Virginia|US 50]], and two local roads; the direct interchange between I-495 and US 50 is a full cloverleaf, while the braided local interchanges between I-495, US 50, and the local roads are modified [[SPUI]]s. The entire complex is bounded on the northeast side by Fairview Lake and on the southwest side by an office complex.

Continuing due south, the route then interchanges with Gallows Road, then skirts the eastern edge of [[Mill Creek Park (Virginia)|Mill Creek Park]] before interchanging with [[Virginia State Route 236|VA 236]] southwest of [[Annandale Community Park]]. Running along the eastern edge of [[Wakefield Park (Annandale, Virginia)|Wakefield Park]], the Beltway turns southeast and interchanges with [[State Route 620 (Fairfax County, Virginia)|VA 620]] before turning east near [[Flag Run Park]] and entering [[Springfield, Virginia|Springfield]], meeting the [[Springfield Interchange]] with I-95 southeast of the [[Shirley Industrial Complex]].

===I-95/I-495 concurrency in Virginia===

I-95 joins the Beltway within the [[Springfield Interchange]]. I-495 also meets the southern terminus of [[Interstate 395 (Virginia)|Interstate 395]] within the same massive interchange complex.
[[File:Capital Beltway from Metro bridge.jpg|thumb|left|I-95/I-495 in Alexandria, seen from the [[Yellow Line (Washington Metro)|Yellow Line]] of the [[Washington Metro]]]]
Running due east away from the interchange, crossing to the south of [[Backlick Stream Valley Park]], the Beltway (now I-95/I495) interchanges with [[State Route 613 (Fairfax County, Virginia)|VA 613]] a mile east of the Springfield Interchange. Continuing east, the Beltway encounters a diamond interchange with a connector road linking to Eisenhower Avenue, which parallels the Beltway for a short distance. Skirting the northern edges of [[Loftridge Park]] and [[Burgundy Park]] the two routes enter [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] and soon reach [[Virginia State Route 241|VA 241]], a direct route into the city, currently under major reconstruction. Within the interchange, the Beltway nears the western approach to the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge.

Continuing east the two routes encounter [[U.S. Route 1 in Virginia|US 1]], a major north-south highway providing access to Alexandria, [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] and downtown Washington, as well as various points south in [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], Virginia. Finally, beyond this complex interchange, I-95 and I-495 together cross Alexandria's  [[Jones Point Park]] and exit Virginia via the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]].

==History==
The idea of building a highway around the Washington suburbs had been discussed at least since 1944, when Fred W. Tummler, director of planning of the [[National Capital Planning Commission|National Capital Park and Planning Commission]], proposed an Inter-County Metropolitan Freeway.<ref>{{cite news |title = Express Highway System Plans Revealed for Md.-Capital Area |date = November 21, 1944 |first = Betty |last = McDevitt |work = The Washington Post |page = 1 |issn = 0190-8286 |id = {{ProQuest|151705862}} }} {{subscription required}}</ref> The [[Senate Public Works Committee]] backed the idea of building the highway in 1951, asking the Public Roads Bureau to prepare plans for the highway.<ref name=askplan>{{cite news |title = Senators Ask Plan for D.C.

The first section of the {{convert|64|mi|km|adj=on}} long Beltway (including the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge|Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]]) was opened on December 21, 1961; the highway was completed on August 17, 1964.

Originally designated I-495, in 1977 the eastern portion of the Beltway was re-designated [[Interstate 95|I-95]] when a proposed alignment of I-95 from [[New York Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|New York Avenue]] in Washington, D.C., through [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] to I-495 was canceled. Motorists never fully adjusted to the two halves of the Beltway having different numbers. According to Ron Shaffer of the ''Washington Post'',

{{quote|There were signs stating that to continue on the Beltway, you had to get off at the next exit, when all you really had to do was keep going straight. Lots of resistance from bureaucrats, but eventually we got dual I-95/I-495 signs on the eastern half of the Beltway.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/24/AR2006062400980.html |work = The Washington Post |title = After 20 Years of Columns, Checking the Rearview Mirror One Last Time |first = Ron |last = Shaffer |date = June 25, 2006 |accessdate = May 5, 2010 |issn = 0190-8286 }}</ref>}}

In 1989, the I-495 designation was restored to the eastern portion, making it a dual I-95/I-495.<ref>{{AASHTO minutes |year= 1991S}}</ref>

Traveling clockwise, the Beltway is designated as the \"[[Inner/Outer labeling|Inner Loop]]\"; traveling counter-clockwise, it is designated as the \"[[Inner/Outer labeling|Outer Loop]]\". This parlance too has led to its own confusion, with unfamiliar motorists imagining two separate, distinct highway alignments, one some distance inside the other. At entrance ramps to the Beltway and on the on-highway signage, \"Inner Loop\" and \"Outer Loop\" shields are posted in conjunction with the route marker shields, although the terms are not emphasized in signage.

The Beltway was originally envisioned as primarily a bypass for long-distance eastern seaboard traffic to avoid driving directly through Washington. However, the explosive growth both of housing and business in the Washington suburbs following the Beltway's completion quickly made the Beltway the area's \"main street\" for local traffic as well. Numerous large shopping malls, community colleges, sports and concert stadiums, and corporate employment centers were purposely built adjacent to the Beltway, and these added greatly to the traffic, as has the passenger growth of regional airports accessed by the Beltway. The formerly more affordable price of housing in Southern Maryland versus [[Northern Virginia]], also led tens of thousands of commuters to live in Southern Maryland and commute on the Beltway to Virginia. The newer [[Fairfax County Parkway]] in the 1990s helped ease some traffic on the Virginia beltway; however, various proposals to build another complete [[Washington Outer Beltway|outer beltway]] in the outer suburbs has not gotten off the ground, because local governments in Maryland object to building additional [[Potomac River]] crossings as well as destroying protected \"open space\" and creating [[suburban sprawl|sprawl]].

===College Park Interchange===
[[File:College Park Interchange.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of the College Park Interchange]]
[[File:2019-06-03 11 53 32 View north along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway at the split between Interstate 95 North towards Baltimore and Interstate 495 West towards Silver Spring in Beltsville, Prince Georges County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|The I-95/I-495 split at College Park, Maryland]]
The College Park Interchange is the informal name for the northern interchange between I-95 and I-495 in College Park. The interchange was partially opened, along with the connecting segment of I-95, in 1971, completing I-95 between the Baltimore Beltway and the Capital Beltway. As originally planned, it was designed with the idea that mainline I-95 through traffic would continue straight through the interchange and south into [[Washington D.C.]] as the [[Northeast Freeway (Washington, D.C.)|Northeast Freeway]], joining the [[North Central Freeway (Washington, D.C.)|North Central Freeway]] within D.C. and running south towards the central business district. When the D.C. government canceled its segment of I-95 in 1977, I-95 was rerouted onto the eastern half of the Capital Beltway, which lost its designation as I-495 (this was restored in 1989, forming a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] of I-95 and I-495 on the eastern half). As a result of this rerouting, the interchange was placed under considerable pressure to cater for a traffic flow that it was not designed to handle.

Originally, travelers from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop had to traverse the one-lane cloverleaf ramp in the southwest quadrant of the interchange; after exiting the ramp, traffic then had to weave through Inner Loop traffic headed for [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]]. This unsafe condition was rectified by November 1986, when the flyover from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop was constructed for I-95 southbound through traffic; the existing one-lane cloverleaf ramp was retained for access to the new C-D lane on the Inner Loop within the US 1 interchange, to segregate through traffic from southbound I-95 and local traffic for US 1. The stump end of the interchange was also modified into its present configuration, and the [[Park and Ride]] was built.

===Traffic congestion===
Despite numerous widening projects during its history, heavy traffic on the Beltway is a continuing problem. The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]]—where eight lanes were squeezed into six—was particularly onerous, with miles-long backups daily during commuter rush hours and on heavily traveled weekends. Relief for this bottleneck came on May 30, 2008, when the 12-lane replacement bridge opened to traffic in both directions (the six-lane span carrying Outer Loop traffic had opened in June 2006). Two of the lanes on the Wilson are being held in reserve  for future use as bus rapid transit or rail transit.

[[File:2019-05-29 17 54 50 View south along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) at Exit 57A (Interstate 95 South, Richmond) along the edge of North Springfield and Springfield in Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|left|View south along I-495 approaching the Springfield Interchange in Springfield, Virginia]]
Two intersections on the Capital Beltway are ranked in the top 20 on a study of the \"worst bottlenecks in the nation.\" They are the I-495 at [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|I-270]] interchange in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], ranked third overall, which receives 760,425 cars daily, and the College Park Interchange in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], ranked 11th, with 340,125 cars. The [[Springfield Interchange]], where [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|I-395]], I-95, and I-495 meet, was previously ranked fifth worst in the nation, but recent improvements have taken it off the top 20. Local commuters refer to the Springfield Interchange as \"The Mixing Bowl,\" although this designation is reserved by highway officials for the even more complicated [[Pentagon road network|interchange]] complex adjacent to [[The Pentagon]] on the original [[Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway]] (currently better-known as [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]]) at [[Virginia State Route 27|State Route 27]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]].

In April 2005, the [[Virginia Department of Transportation]] signed an agreement with two private companies to build [[high-occupancy toll]] lanes on the stretch of the Beltway between Springfield and Georgetown Pike.  Construction began in 2008. Maryland officials are considering such lanes on their segment of the Beltway, as well as other major commuter highways in the state. Locals who disapprove of these projects have nicknamed them \"[[Lexus]] Lanes\" because of the potential high price for using the lanes in exchange for bypassing congestion. These new lanes are one stage of a controversial project to widen the beltway, with the second stage involving widening the beltway to 12 lanes; opponents have called for various alternatives to this project (as well as the controversial [[Maryland Route 200|Intercounty Connector]] project) which would divert many vehicles off the northern beltway. The [[Maryland Transit Administration]]'s proposed [[Purple Line (Maryland)|Purple Line]] light rail transit line is just one example.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.smartergrowth.net/issues/transportation/roads/beltway/index.html |title = The Beltway |publisher = Coalition for Smarter Growth |accessdate = August 24, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091220004753/http://www.smartergrowth.net/issues/transportation/roads/beltway/index.html |archive-date = December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

The Beltway has been improved since it opened. The American Legion Bridge was expanded by two lanes. HOV lanes were added between River Road and the I-270 Spur in Montgomery County, Maryland. The interchange between I-95 and the Beltway in Prince George's County, Maryland was originally designed to be a cloverleaf to allow I-95 to extend southward toward the District of Columbia. After I-95 was realigned onto the Beltway, a flyover ramp was built to allow I-95 through traffic to have two high-speed lanes. The interchange between U.S. Route 50 and I-95/I-495 in Prince George's County, Maryland was upgraded from a simple cloverleaf to a hybrid turbine interchange. In the Beltway's original configuration, I-295 and Indian Head Highway had separate interchanges. As a result, north-south traffic between I-295 and Indian Head Highway was forced to merge onto a congested section of the Beltway for approximately one mile. As a congestion relief measure, I-295 was extended over the Beltway and continued parallel to it so that the two highways were directly connected independent of the beltway. However, these interchanges were redesigned and rebuilt to accommodate the expansion of the Wilson Bridge and the construction of dedicated ramps to National Harbor.

In January 2018, Maryland State Democratic Sen. [[Joanne C.

[[File:Woodrow wilson bridge june06.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] under reconstruction, June 2006]]
The [[Springfield Interchange]] in Virginia completed reconstruction in 2007.  The eight-year, nearly $676 million project worked to eliminate weaving among local and long-distance traffic between I-95, I-395, the Beltway, and [[Virginia State Route 644 (Fairfax County)|State Route 644]].

The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] underwent reconstruction in a major project that began in 1999; it now provides express and local lanes for both the Inner and Outer Loops. The new Wilson Bridge is higher and wider than the original 1961 span, which was demolished in 2006. The Outer Loop span opened in June 2006, and the Inner Loop span opened in May 2008.

Also, in association with the Wilson Bridge project, the [[Virginia State Route 241|Telegraph Road]] and [[U.S. 1]] interchanges (exits 176 and 177) in Alexandria, Virginia were rebuilt. The [[Interstate 295 (Maryland)|I-295]] and [[Maryland Route 210|MD 210]]  interchanges (exits 2 and 3) in Maryland were rebuilt as well. These improvement lasted through 2013.

The Branch Avenue ([[Maryland Route 5]]) Interchange was also improved.

===Virginia HOT lanes===

At the left is the elevated ramp to access the HOT lanes from Route 123 via Westpark Drive (Tysons Corner). In the background is the [[Silver Line (Washington Metro)|Silver Line]] viaduct.]]
The [[Virginia Department of Transportation]] authorized a [[public-private partnership]] to construct [[high-occupancy toll]] (HOT) lanes in Northern Virginia. The project added two lanes to I-495 in each direction from just west of the Springfield Interchange to just north of the [[Dulles Toll Road]], and included the replacement of more than 50 bridges, overpasses, and major interchanges.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://virginiahotlanes.com/ |title = Virginia HOT Lanes |publisher = Fluor-Transurban |accessdate = December 8, 2008 |archive-url = https://archive.is/20120527034614/http://virginiahotlanes.com/ |archive-date = May 27, 2012 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

Drivers of vehicles with fewer than three occupants are required to pay a toll to use the lanes.  Tolls change dynamically, with higher tolls charged during periods of heaviest congestion.  Drivers using the HOT Lanes are required to carry an [[E-ZPass]] transponder to allow [[electronic toll collection]], eliminating the need for toll booths.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://virginiahotlanes.com/beltway/how-hot-lanes-work/ |title = How HOT Lanes Work |publisher = Fluor-Transurban |accessdate = May 29, 2011 |archive-url = https://archive.is/20101129082531/http://virginiahotlanes.com/beltway/how-hot-lanes-work/ |archive-date = November 29, 2010 |url-status = dead }}</ref> Tolls are waived for buses, carpools of at least three people, motorcycles, and emergency vehicles with an E-ZPass Flex transponder set to the \"HOV ON\" configuration. If more than a specified number of carpools or buses use the lanes, Virginia must pay the tolls for the excess vehicles.

At the north and south terminal of the HOT lanes, motorists are able to transition directly between the HOT lanes and the I-495 general purpose lanes.  However, elsewhere along the corridor, access to and from the HOT lanes is only permitted from cross roads.  Some cross roads provide access to both HOT lanes and general purpose lanes; others have access only to one system or the other.  Many HOT lane access points serve traffic in only one direction of I-495, which is intended to complement typical commuting patterns.  HOT lane interchanges are as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url = http://virginiahotlanes.com/beltway/project-info/ |title = Virginia HOT Lanes Project Info |publisher = Fluor-Transurban |accessdate = September 30, 2010 |archive-url = https://archive.is/20120716085216/http://virginiahotlanes.com/beltway/project-info/ |archive-date = July 16, 2012 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

The original scope of the HOT project is covered by a fixed-price $1.3 billion contract between concessionaire Capital Beltway Express LLC and contractor [[Fluor Corporation|Fluor-Lane LLC]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.virginiahotlanes.com/uploads/1000/346-DBCExecutionCopy.pdf |title = Turnkey Lump-sum Design-Build Contract |accessdate = December 23, 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101221235237/http://virginiahotlanes.com/uploads/1000/346-DBCExecutionCopy.pdf |archive-date = December 21, 2010 |url-status = dead }}</ref> The partnership has proposed extending the scope of the project to north to the Potomac River.

In 2004, [[Transurban|Transurban (USA) Development Inc.]] joined the Fluor team to serve as concessionaire and long-term operator of the HOT lanes.  After a competitive procurement, the team was selected to deliver and operate the new HOT lanes.  After a series of public meetings and environmental studies, the project was approved and funded in 2007. Construction began in the summer of 2008. The Express Lanes were opened for public access on November 17, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.495expresslanes.com/project-background |title = Project Background |accessdate = October 15, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120926161142/https://www.495expresslanes.com/project-background |archive-date = September 26, 2012 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

===Maryland express toll lanes===

In September 2017, Governor [[Larry Hogan]] announced a plan to widen the portion of I-495 in Maryland by four lanes, adding [[express toll lane]]s to the median, as part of an $11+ billion proposal to widen roads in Maryland. The project would be a public-private partnership with private companies responsible for constructing, operating, and maintaining the lanes.<ref name=wtop>{{cite web |url = http://wtop.com/maryland/2017/09/hogan-proposes-9b-plan-add-new-lanes-beltway-270-bw-parkway/ |title = Hogan proposes $9B plan to add new lanes to Beltway, 270 and BW Parkway |date = September 21, 2017 |publisher = WTOP-FM |location = Washington, DC |accessdate = September 21, 2017 }}</ref> On June 5, 2019, the Maryland Board of Public Works voted 2–1 in favor of the proposal to construct express toll lanes along I-495, with Governor Hogan and State Comptroller [[Peter Franchot]] voting for it and State Treasurer [[Nancy Kopp]] voting against it. The widening and addition of express toll lanes along I-495 will be split into two phases, with the first phase expanding the road in Montgomery County and the second phase expanding the road in Prince George's County.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kurtz |first1=Josh |title=Divided Maryland Board of Public Works OKs public-private partnership for highway expansion after explosive hearing |url=https://wtop.com/maryland/2019/06/divided-maryland-board-of-public-works-oks-public-private-partnership-for-highway-expansion-after-explosive-hearing/ |accessdate=June 6, 2019 |publisher=WTOP-FM|location=Washington, DC|date=June 5, 2019}}</ref> On June 12, 2019, the [[Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission]] (M-NCCPC) sent a letter of non-concurrence to the MDSHA, triggering a mediation process with MDSHA.

===Exit numbering===
Exit numbers on the Beltway have gone through several iterations.  Originally, all exits on the Beltway were numbered sequentially in a clockwise direction, starting with exit 1 for US 1 in Alexandria. After the eastern half of the Beltway was renumbered in 1977 as [[Interstate 95]], exits on the Maryland portion were renumbered to the current format, counterclockwise with exit numbers assigned to mileposts.  This caused problems because there were some exits that had the same number in Maryland and Virginia.  Around 2000, this problem was solved by renumbering all of the Virginia exits. The exit numbers between the [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]] and the [[Springfield Interchange]]—Interstate 495's intersection with [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]] and [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95 in Virginia]]—became a continuation of the Maryland exit numbers from the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] to the [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]]. The exit numbers between the [[Springfield Interchange]] and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge became a continuation of the exit numbers of I-95 in Virginia; such exit numbers are much higher than those on the rest of the Beltway, but continue to increase in the counterclockwise direction. The counterclockwise numbering on the Capital Beltway is a rarity, as most similar loop highways, like the [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|Baltimore Beltway]], have their exit numbers/mileage set in a clockwise arrangement.

==Exit list==
===Mainline===
The Commonwealth of Virginia formerly reset exit numbers at state lines, and numbered them from the counterclockwise end to the clockwise end.{{jcttop|old|state_col=State|old_ref=<ref>{{cite map |author = [[H.M.

'''Gog and Magog''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ɒ|g|...|ˈ|m|eɪ|g|ɒ|g}}; {{lang-he-n|גּוֹג וּמָגוֹג}}; ''Gog u-Magog,'' [[Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|{{Nastaliq|يأجوج ومأجوج}}}}; ''Yaʾjūj wa-Maʾjūj'') appear in the [[Hebrew Bible]], often known as the Old Testament, and [[Quran]] 21:96 as individuals, tribes, or lands. In [[Ezekiel 38]], Gog is an individual and Magog is his land;{{sfn|Lust|1999b|pp=373–374}} in Genesis 10 Magog is a man, but no Gog is mentioned; and centuries later Jewish tradition changed Ezekiel's \"Gog ''from'' Magog\" into \"Gog ''and'' Magog\",{{r|boring}} which is the form in which they appear in the Christian New Testament's [[Book of Revelation]], although there they are peoples rather than individuals.{{r|mounce}}

A legend was attached to Gog and Magog by the time of the [[Pax Romana|Roman period]], that the [[Gates of Alexander]] were erected by [[Alexander the Great]] to repel the tribe. Romanized Jewish historian [[Josephus]] knew them as the nation descended from Magog the [[Japhetites|Japhetite]], as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], and explained them to be the [[Scythians]]. In the hands of Early Christian writers they became apocalyptic hordes, and throughout the Medieval period variously identified as the [[Vikings]], [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Mongols]], [[Ural-Altaic race|Turanians]] or other [[Eurasian nomads|nomads]], or even the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of [[Israelites|Israel]].

The legend of Gog and Magog and the gates were also interpolated into the [[Alexander romance]]s. In one version, \"Goth and Magothy\" (that means Muralla in Maranaw people) are kings of the Unclean Nations, driven beyond a mountain pass by Alexander, and blocked from returning by his new wall. Gog and Magog are said to engage in [[human cannibalism]] in the romances and derived literature. They have also been depicted on Medieval cosmological maps, or ''[[mappa mundi|mappae mundi]]'', sometimes alongside Alexander's wall.

The conflation of Gog and Magog with the legend of Alexander and the Iron Gates was disseminated throughout the Near East in the early centuries of the Christian and Islamic era.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=123}} They appear in the [[Quran]] in chapter [[Al-Kahf]] as Yajuj and Majuj ({{Lang-ar|{{Nastaliq|يأجوج ومأجوج}}}}; {{transl|ar|DIN|Yaʾjūj wa-Maʾjūj}}), primitive and immoral tribes that were separated and barriered off by [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] (possessor of the Two Horns), who is mentioned in the Qu'ran as a great righteous ruler and conqueror.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=57, fn 3}} Many modern Muslim historians and geographers regarded the [[Vikings]] as the emergence of Gog and Magog.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b4MjAQAAMAAJ&q=vikings+and+gog+and+magog&dq=vikings+and+gog+and+magog&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj40viCj_zkAhWHgVwKHRsQAaoQ6AEINzAC|title=Kings and Vikings: Scandinavia and Europe, A.D. 700-1100|first=P. H.|last=Sawyer|date=April 10, 1982|publisher=Methuen|via=Google Books}}</ref> In contemporary times they remain associated with apocalyptic thinking, especially in [[Israel]] and the [[Muslim world]].

==The names Gog and Magog==
{{Eschatology}}
The names are mentioned together in [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] [[Ezekiel 38|chapter 38]], where Gog is an individual and Magog is his land.{{sfn|Lust|1999b|pp=373–374}} The meaning of the name Gog remains uncertain, and in any case, the author of the Ezekiel prophecy seems to attach no particular importance to it.{{sfn|Lust|1999b|pp=373–374}} Efforts have been made to identify him with various individuals, notably [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]], a king of [[Lydia]] in the early 7th century BC, but many scholars do not believe he is related to any historical person.{{sfn|Lust|1999b|pp=373–374}} 

In [[Genesis 10]] Magog is a person, son of [[Japheth]] son of [[Noah]], but no Gog is mentioned. The name Magog is equally obscure, but may come from the Assyrian ''mat-Gugu'', \"Land of Gyges\", i.e., Lydia.{{r|gmirkin}} Alternatively, Gog may be derived from Magog rather than the other way round, and \"Magog\" may be code for [[Babylon]].{{efn|The encryption technique is called ''[[atbash]]''. BBL (\"Babylon\") when read backwards and displaced by one letter becomes MGG (Magog).}}{{sfn|Lust|1999a|p=536}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Bøe|2001|loc=pp. 84, fn 31}}. Lust and Bøe cite Brownlee (1983) \"Son of Man Set Your Face: Ezekiel the Refugee Prophet\", ''HUCA'' '''54'''.</ref>

The form \"Gog and Magog\" may have emerged as shorthand for \"Gog and/of the land of Magog\", based on their usage in the [[Septuagint]], the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible.{{sfn|Buitenwerf|2007|p=166}} An example of this combined form in Hebrew (''Gog u-Magog'') has been found, but its context is unclear, being preserved only in a fragment of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].{{efn|4Q523 scroll}}{{sfn|Buitenwerf|2007|p=172}} In Revelation, Gog and Magog together are the hostile nations of the world.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|pp=89–90}}{{r|mounce}} Gog or Goug the [[Reubenite]]{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|All Reubenites are held to be descendants of Reuben in the view of the Torah, but it is unclear what family relationship Gog's father Joel has with the sons of Reuben in verse 3.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|p=49}}}} occurs in [[1 Chronicles]] {{bibleverse-nb|1 Chronicles|5:4|KJV}}, but he appears to have no connection with the Gog of Ezekiel or Magog of Genesis.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|p=1}}

The Biblical \"Gog and Magog\" possibly gave derivation of the name [[Gogmagog (giant)|Gogmagog]], a legendary British giant.{{efn|The giant mentioned by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (1136 AD).<!--Simpson & Roud (2000)-->}}<ref>{{citation|last1=Simpson |first1=Jacqueline |last2=Roud |first2=Stephen |author-link1=Jacqueline Simpson |author-link2=Steve Roud |title=Oxford Dictionary of English Folklore |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |at=Gogmagog (or Gog and Magog) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTcdvd1iRXsC&pg=PT409 |isbn=9780192100191}}</ref> A later corrupted folk rendition in print altered the tradition around Gogmagog and [[Corineus]] with two giants Gog and Magog, with whom the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] statues came to be identified.<ref>{{citation|last=Fairholt |first=Frederick William  |author-link=Frederick William Fairholt |title=Gog and Magog: The Giants in Guildhall; Their Real and Legendary History |publisher=John Camden Hotten |year=1859 |pages=8–11, 130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VoQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA8}}</ref>

==Judeo-Christian texts==
{{Christian Eschatology}}

===In Ezekiel and the Old Testament===
[[File:Flemish - Ezekiel's Vision of the Sign \"Tau\" (Ezekiel IX -2-7) - Walters 44616 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Ezekiel's Vision of the Sign \"Tau\" from Ezekiel IX:2–7. {{right|{{small|—[[Mosan art|Mosan]] [[champlevé]] panel, mid-12th century.}}}}]]

The [[Book of Ezekiel]] records a series of visions received by the prophet [[Ezekiel]], a priest of [[Solomon's Temple]], who was among the captive during the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]]. The exile, he tells his fellow captives, is [[God in Judaism|God]]'s punishment on Israel for turning away, but God will restore his people to [[Jerusalem]] when they return to him.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|1996|p=178}} After this message of reassurance, chapters [[Wikisource:Bible (World English)/Ezekiel#Chapter 38|38–39]], the Gog oracle, tell how Gog of Magog and his hordes will threaten the restored Israel but will be destroyed, after which God will establish a new Temple and dwell with his people for a period of lasting peace (chapters 40–48).{{r|bullock}} 

<blockquote>\"Son of man, direct your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince, leader of [[Meshech]] and [[Tubal]], and prophesy concerning him. Say: Thus said the Lord: Behold, I am against you, Gog, the prince, leader of Meshech and Tubal&nbsp;... Persia, [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]] and Put will be with you&nbsp;... also [[Gomer]] with all its troops, and Beth [[Togarmah]] from the far north with all its troops—the many nations with you.\"<!-- passage is dialogue, don't remove quotation marks --><ref>{{Bibleverse | Ezekiel | 38 | NRSV}} (NRSV)</ref></blockquote>

Internal evidence indicates that the Gog oracle was composed substantially later than the chapters around it.{{efn|Composed between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC<!--Tooman (2011), p. 271-->}}{{sfn|Tooman|2011|p=271}}Of Gog's allies, Meshech and Tubal were 7th-century kingdoms in central [[Anatolia]] north of Israel, Persia towards east, Cush (Ethiopia) and Put (Libya) to the south; Gomer is the [[Cimmerians]], a nomadic people north of the Black Sea, and Beth Togarmah was on the border of Tubal.{{sfn|Block|1998|pp=72–73, 439–440}} The confederation thus represents a multinational alliance surrounding Israel.{{r|hays-duvall-pate}} \"Why the prophet's gaze should have focused on these particular nations is unclear,\" comments Biblical scholar [[Daniel I. Block]], but their remoteness and reputation for violence and mystery possibly \"made Gog and his confederates perfect symbols of the archetypal enemy, rising against God and his people\".{{sfn|Block|1998|p=436}} One explanation is that the Gog alliance, a blend of the \"[[Generations of Noah|Table of Nations]]\" in Genesis 10 and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]'s trading partners in Ezekiel 27, with Persia added, was cast in the role of end-time enemies of Israel by means of Isaiah 66:19, which is another text of eschatological foretelling.{{sfn|Tooman|2011|pp=147–148}}

Although the prophecy refers to Gog as an enemy in some future, it is not clear if the confrontation is meant to occur in a final \"[[End of Days (eschatology)|end of days]]\" since the Hebrew term ''aḥarit ha-yamim'' ({{lang-he-n|אחרית הימים}}) may merely mean \"latter days\", and is open to interpretation. Twentieth-century scholars have used the term to denote the [[eschaton]] in a malleable sense, not necessarily meaning final days, or tied to the Apocalypse.<!--p.94-->{{efn|Tooman's view is that the \"latter days\" means \"the end of history-as-we-know-it and the initiation of a new historical age\".<!--Tooman, p.96-->}}{{sfn|Tooman|2011|pp=94–97}} Still, the Utopia of chapters 40–48 can be spoken of in the parlance of \"true [[eschatology|eschatological]] character, given that it is a product of \"cosmic conflict\" described in the immediately preceding Gog chapters.{{r|petersen}}

The Septuagint reads \"Agag\" instead of \"Gog\" in Numbers 24:7.

===Gog and Magog from Ezekiel to Revelation===

[[File:Apokalipsis trekhtolkoviy (1909) 64 - O Goze i Magoze.jpg|thumb|250px|Devil, Gog and Magog attack the Holy City. (from a 17th century Russian manuscript)]]
Over the next few centuries Jewish tradition changed Ezekiel's Gog ''from'' Magog into Gog ''and'' Magog.{{r|boring}} The process, and the shifting geography of Gog and Magog, can be traced through the literature of the period. The 3rd book of the [[Sibylline Oracles]], for example, which originated in Egyptian Judaism in the middle of the 2nd century BC,{{r|wardle}} changes Ezekiel's \"Gog from Magog\" to \"Gog and Magog\", links their fate with up to eleven other nations, and places them \"in the midst of [[Aethiopia]]n rivers\"; this seems a strange location, but ancient geography did sometimes place Ethiopia next to Persia or even India.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|pp=142–144}} The passage has a highly uncertain text, with manuscripts varying in their groupings of the letters of the Greek text into words, leading to different readings; one group of manuscripts (\"group Y\") links them with the \"[[Moesia|Marsians]] and [[Dacia]]ns\", in eastern Europe, amongst others.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|pp=145–146}}

The [[Book of Jubilees]], from about the same time, makes three references to either Gog or Magog: in the first, Magog is a descendant of Noah, as in Genesis 10; in the second, Gog is a region next to Japheth's borders; and in the third, a portion of Japheth's land is assigned to Magog.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|p=153}} The 1st-century [[Pseudo-Philo|''Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum'']], which retells Biblical history from Adam to Saul, is notable for listing and naming seven of Magog's sons, and mentions his \"thousands\" of descendants.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|pp=186–189}} The [[Samaritan Torah]] and the [[Septuagint]] (a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible made during the last few centuries of the pre-Christian era) occasionally introduce the name of Gog where the Hebrew original has something else, or use Magog where the Hebrew has Gog, indicating that the names were interchangeable.{{sfn|Lust|1999a|pp=536–537}}

Chapters 19:11–21:8 of the [[Book of Revelation]], dating from the end of the 1st century AD,{{r|stuckenbruck}} tells how [[Satan]] is to be imprisoned for a thousand years, and how, on his release, he will rally \"the nations in the four corners of the Earth, Gog and Magog\", to a final battle with Christ and his saints:{{r|mounce}}

<blockquote>When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the Earth—Gog and Magog—and to gather them for battle.

The 1st-century Jewish historian [[Josephus]] identified the Gog and Magog people as [[Scythians]], horse-riding barbarians from around the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and the [[Sea of Azov]]. Josephus recounts the tradition that Gog and Magog were locked up by Alexander the Great behind [[Gates of Alexander|iron gates]] in the \"Caspian Mountains\", generally identified with the [[Caucasus]] Mountains. This legend must have been current in contemporary Jewish circles by this period, coinciding with the beginning of the Christian Era.{{efn|1=Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D1%3Awhiston%20chapter%3D6%3Awhiston%20section%3D1 1.123] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D18%3Awhiston+chapter%3D4%3Awhiston+section%3D4 18.97]; ''[[The Jewish War]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0148%3Abook%3D7%3Awhiston%20chapter%3D7%3Awhiston%20section%3D4 7.244–51]}}{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=122}} Several centuries later, this material was vastly elaborated in the ''[[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]'' and [[Alexander romance]].{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|pp=122–125}}

The ''Pseudo-Methodius'', written originally in Syriac, is considered the source of Gog and Magog tale incorporated into Western versions of the Alexander Romance.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=30}}{{sfn|Stoneman|1991|p=29}} An earlier-dated Syriac ''Alexander Legend'' contains a somewhat different treatment of the Gog and Magog material, which passed into the lost Arabic version,{{sfn|Boyle|1979|p=123}} or the Ethiopic and later Oriental versions of the Alexander romance.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=32}}{{efn|The Ethiopic version derives from the lost Arabic version ({{harvnb|Boyle|1979|p=133}}).

In the Syriac ''Alexander Legend'' dating to 629–630, Gog ({{lang-syr|ܓܘܓ|}}, gwg) and Magog ({{lang-syr|ܡܓܘܓ}}ܵ, mgwg) appear as kings of [[Huns|Hunnish]] nations.{{efn|Also called ''Christian Legend concerning Alexander'', ed. tr. by E.

===Alexander romances===

Gog and Magog also appear in [[Thomas de Kent]]'s ''Roman de toute chevalerie'' (c. 1180), where they are portrayed as cave-dwellers who consume human flesh.

==Identification with civilisations==
Early Christian writers (e.g. [[Eusebius]]) frequently identified Gog and Magog with the Romans and their emperor.{{sfn|Lust|1999b|p=375}} After the Empire became Christian, [[Ambrose]] (d. 397) identified Gog with the [[Goths]], [[Jerome]] (d. 420) with the [[Scythians]], and [[Jordanes]] (died c. 555) said that Goths, Scythians and [[Amazons]] were all the same; he also cited Alexander's gates in the Caucasus.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=125}}{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|The idea that Gog and Magog were connected with the Goths was longstanding; in the mid-16th century, Archbishop of Uppsala [[Johannes Magnus]] traced the royal family of [[Sweden]] back to Magog son of Japheth, via Suenno, progenitor of the Swedes, and Gog, ancestor of the Goths).{{r|derry}}}} The [[Byzantine]] writer [[Procopius]] said it was the Huns Alexander had locked out, and a Western monk named Fredegar seems to have Gog and Magog in mind in his description of savage hordes from beyond Alexander's gates who had assisted the Byzantine emperor Heraclius (610–641) against the Muslim [[Saracens]].{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|pp=125–126}}

===Nomadic identification===
As one nomadic people followed another on the Eurasian steppes, so the identification of Gog and Magog shifted. In the 9th and 10th centuries these kingdoms were identified by some with the lands of the [[Khazars]], a Turkic people who had converted to Judaism and whose empire dominated Central Asia–the 9th-century monk [[Christian of Stavelot]] referred to Gazari, said of the Khazars that they were \"living in the lands of Gog and Magog\" and noted that they were \"circumcised and observing all [the laws of] Judaism\".{{sfn|Brook|2006|pp=7–8, 96}}{{sfn|Westrem|1998|p=65}} Arab traveler ibn Fadlan also reported of this belief, writing around 921 he recorded that \"Some hold the opinion that Gog and Magog are the Khazars\".{{sfn|Brook|2006|p=8}}

After the Khazars came the [[Mongols]], seen as a mysterious and invincible horde from the east who destroyed Muslim empires and kingdoms in the early 13th century; kings and popes took them for the legendary [[Prester John]], marching to save Christians from the Muslim [[Saracens]], but when they entered Poland and Hungary and annihilated Christian armies a terrified Europe concluded that they were \"Magogoli\", the offspring of Gog and Magog, released from the prison Alexander had constructed for them and heralding [[Armageddon]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=12, 120–122, 144}}

[[Europeans in Medieval China]] reported findings from their travels to the [[Mongol Empire]]. Some accounts and maps began to place the \"Caspian Mountains\", and Gog and Magog, just outside the [[Great Wall of China]]. The ''[[Tartar Relation]]'', an obscure account of Friar Carpini's 1240s journey to Mongolia, is unique in alleging that these Caspian Mountains in Mongolia, \"where the Jews called Gog and Magog by their fellow countrymen are said to have been shut in by Alexander\", were moreover purported by the Tartars to be magnetic, causing all iron equipment and weapons to fly off toward the mountains on approach.{{r|painter}} In 1251, the French friar [[André de Longjumeau]] informed his king that the Mongols originated from a desert further east, and an apocalyptic Gog and Magog (\"Got and Margoth\") people dwelled further beyond, confined by the mountains.{{sfn|William of Rubruck|Rockhill (tr.)|1900|pp=xxi, fn 2}}

In fact, Gog and Magog were held by the Mongol to be their ancestors, at least by some segment of the population. As traveler and Friar [[Riccoldo da Monte di Croce]] put it in c. 1291, \"They say themselves that they are descended from Gog and Magog: and on this account they are called ''Mogoli'', as if from a corruption of ''Magogoli''\".{{sfn|Boyle|1979|p=126}}{{Sfn|Marco Polo|Yule (tr.)|1875|pp=285, fn 5}}{{sfn|Westrem|1998|pp=66–67}} [[Marco Polo]], traveling when the initial terror had subsided, places Gog and Magog among the [[Tartars]] in [[Hohhot|Tenduc]], but then claims that the names Gog and Magog are translations of the place-names Ung and Mungul, inhabited by the Ung and Mongols respectively.{{Sfn|Marco Polo|Yule (tr.)|1875|pp=276–286}}{{r|strickland}}

<!--Even if Gog and Magog were considered ancestors, this location of Gog and Magog seems too far east.-->An explanation offered by Orientalist [[Henry Yule]] was that Marco Polo was only referring to the \"Rampart of Gog and Magog\", a name for the Great Wall of China.{{sfn|Marco Polo|Yule (tr.)|1875|pp=283, fn 5}} Friar André's placement of Gog and Magog far east of Mongolia has been similarly explained.{{sfn|William of Rubruck|Rockhill (tr.)|1900|pp=xxi, fn 2}}

===The confined Jews===
Some time around the 12th century, the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of Israel came to be identified with Gog and Magog;{{sfn|Gow|1995|pp=23–24}} possibly the first to do so was [[Petrus Comestor]] in ''Historica Scholastica'' (c. 1169–1173),{{sfn|Gow|1995|p=42}}{{sfn|Boyle|1979|p=124}} and he was indeed a far greater influence than others before him, although the idea had been anticipated by the aforementioned Christian of Stavelot, who noted that the Khazhars, to be identified with Gog and Magog, was one of [[Seven chieftains of the Magyars|seven tribes of the Hungarians]] and had converted to Judaism.{{sfn|Brook|2006|pp=7–8, 96}}{{sfn|Westrem|1998|p=65}}

While the confounding Gog and Magog as confined Jews was becoming commonplace, some, like Riccoldo or [[Vincent de Beauvais]] remained skeptics, and distinguished the Lost Tribes from Gog and Magog.{{sfn|Boyle|1979|p=126}}{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=134}}{{sfn|Gow|1995|pp=56–57}} As noted, Riccoldo had reported a Mongol folk-tradition that they were descended from Gog and Magog. He also addressed many minds (Westerners or otherwise{{sfn|Westrem|1998|p=66}}) being credulous of the notion that Mongols might be Captive Jews, but after weighing the pros and cons, he concluded this was an open question.{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|Riccoldo observed that the Mongol script resembled Chaldean ([[Syriac language|Syriac]],{{Sfn|Marco Polo|Yule (tr.)|1875|pp=58, fn 3}} a form of [[Aramaic]]), and in fact it does derive from Aramaic.{{sfn|Boyle|1979|p=125, note 19}} However, he saw that Mongols bore no physical resemblance to Jews and were ignorant of Jewish laws.}}{{sfn|Westrem|1998|pp=66–67}}{{Sfn|Marco Polo|Yule (tr.)|1875|pp=58, fn 3}}

The Flemish Franciscan friar [[William of Rubruck]], who was first-hand witness to Alexander's [[Fortifications of Derbent|supposed wall]] in [[Derbent]] on the shores of the Caspian Sea in 1254,{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|Rubruck refers Derbent as the \"Iron Gate\", this also being the meaning of the Turkish name (Demir kapi) for the town.{{Sfn|William of Rubruck|Rockhill (tr.)|1900|pp=xlvi, 262 note 1}} Rubruck may have been the only medieval Westerner to claim to have seen it.{{sfn|Westrem|1998|p=66}}}} identified the people the walls were meant to fend off only vaguely as \"wild tribes\" or \"desert nomads\",{{efn|Also \"barbarous nations\", \"savage tribes\".}}{{sfn|William of Rubruck|Rockhill (tr.)|1900|pp=xlvi, 100, 120, 122, 130, 262–263 and fn}} but one researcher made the inference Rubruck must have meant Jews,{{efn|Based on Rubruck stating elsewhere \"There are other enclosures in which there are Jews\"}} and that he was speaking in the context of \"Gog and Magog\".{{efn|Since [[Roger Bacon]], having been informed by Rubruck, urged the study of geography to discover where the [[Antichrist]] and Gog and Magog might be found.}}{{sfn|Westrem|1998|p=66}} Confined Jews were later to be referred to as \"[[Red Jews]]\" (''die roten Juden'') in German-speaking areas; a term first used in a [[Holy Grail]] epic dating to the 1270s, in which Gog and Magog were two mountains enclosing these people.{{efn|[[Albrecht von Scharfenberg]], ''Der jüngere Titurel''. It belongs in the [[Arthurian cycle]].}}{{sfn|Gow|1995|pp=70–71}}

The author of the ''[[John Mandeville|Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]'', a 14th-century best-seller, said he had found these Jews in Central Asia where as Gog and Magog they had been imprisoned by Alexander, plotting to escape and join with the Jews of Europe to destroy Christians.{{sfn|Westrem|1998|pp=68–69}}

Two chapters [[Al-Kahf|''Al Kahf'']] and ''[[Al-Anbiya]]'' of the [[Quran]] discuss Gog and Magog. In the Quran Yajuj and Majuj (Gog and Magog) are suppressed by Dhul-Qarnayn \"the two-horned one\"; this figure is often thought to be derived from either Alexander the Great or [[Cyrus the Great in the Quran|Cyrus the Great]], though there has been no consensus on this.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=57, fn 3}} Dhul-Qarnayn, having journeyed to the ends of the world, meets \"a people who scarcely understood a word\" who seek his help in building a barrier that will separate them from the people of Yajuj and Majuj who \"do great mischief on earth\". He agrees to build it for them, but warns that when the time comes (Last Age), Allah will remove the barrier and Yajuj and Majuj will swarm through.<!--{{sfn|Hughes|1895|p=148}}-->{{r|dict-islam}}[[File:Quran Surah Al Kahf.png|thumb|Surah Al Kahf Story of Gog and Magog |316x316px]]The early Muslim traditions were summarised by [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] (d. 1283) in two popular works called the Cosmography and the Geography. Gog and Magog, he says, live near to the sea that encircles the Earth and can be counted only by God; they are only half the height of a normal man, with claws instead of nails and a hairy tail and huge hairy ears which they use as mattress and cover for sleeping.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=65–68}} They scratch at their wall each day until they almost break through. They break for the night saying tomorrow we will finish, and each night God restores it. Then one day, as they stop scratching for the night, one will say tomorrow we will finish God Willing, and in the morning, it is not restored as with everything night. When they do break through they will be so numerous that \"their vanguard is in [[Syria]] and their rear in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]\".{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=74}}

Various nations and peoples in history were identified as Ya'juj and Ma'juj. At one point, it was the Turks, who threatened [[Baghdad]] and northern Iran;{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=82–84}} later, when the Mongols destroyed Baghdad in 1258, it was they who were Gog and Magog.{{sfn|Filiu|2011|p=30}} The wall dividing them from civilised peoples was normally placed towards [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], but in the year 842 the [[Caliph]] [[Al-Wathiq]] had a dream in which he saw that it had been breached, and sent an official named Sallam to investigate may be related [[Ergenekon]].{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=xvii–xviii, 82}} Sallam returned a little over two years later and reported that he had seen the wall and also the tower where Dhul Qarnayn had left his building equipment, and all was still intact.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=xvii–xviii, 244}} It is not entirely clear what Sallam saw, but he may have reached the [[Jade Gate]] and the westernmost customs point on the border of China.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=xvii–xviii}} Somewhat later the 14th-century traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] reported that the wall was sixty days' travel from the city of [[Quanzhou|Zeitun]], which is on the coast of China; the translator notes that Ibn Battuta has confused the [[Great Wall of China]] with that built by [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] .{{r|gibb-beckingham}}

According to Shia sources, Yajooj and Majooj are not from the Children of Adam (the human race). Al-Kafi, one of their primary collections of ahadith, states that it has been narrated from [[Ibn Abbas]] that when he asked [[Ali]] about the \"creatures\", he responded by saying God has created \"1,200 species on the land, 1,200 species in the sea, 70 species from the Children of Adam and the people are the Children of Adam except for the Yajooj and Majooj\".<ref name= \"Kulayni\">{{cite book |last1=al-Kulayni |first1=Muhammad ibn Ya‘qūb |title=Al-Kafi |date=2015 |publisher=Islamic Seminary Incorporated |location=NY |isbn=9780991430864 |edition=Volume 8 }}</ref> This is in contradiction with many reports in Sunni sources, including those in [[Sahih Al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]], which indicate they will indeed, be from the Children of Adam, and this is the belief of the overwhelming majority of Islamic scholars. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linktoislam.net/islamic-articles/article.aspx?id=40|title=Story of Ya'juj and Ma'juj (Gog and Magog) form The Quran - Link To Islam|website=www.linktoislam.net}}</ref>

According to [[Sahih Muslim]], the Prophet said:

''Then a people whom Allah had protected from him (dajjal) would come to Isa, son of Maryam (alaihimas salam), and he would wipe their faces and would inform them of their ranks in Paradise and it would be under such conditions that Allah would reveal to Isa (alaihis salam) these words: I have brought forth from amongst My servants such people against whom none would be able to fight; you take these people safely to Tur, and then Allah would send Gog and Magog and they would swarm down from every slope. The first of them would pass the lake of Tiberias and drink out of it. And when the last of them would pass, he would say: There was once water there.'' 

Some scholars further attempt to relate the last portion of the interpretation of Yajuj and Majuj to the lake of Tiberias, currently known as the [[Sea of Galilee]], the [[Earth]]'s lowest freshwater lake, and the Dead Sea.<ref>[[Sahih Muslim]], 2937, The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour</ref>

Historian and exegete [[Ibn Kathir]] mentioned similar theories in his book ''[[Al-Bidaya wa'l-Nihaya]]''.<ref>(Shahadat-ul-Qur’an, Ruhani Khazain, Volume 6, Pages 361-362</ref>

=== In Ahmadiyya ===
[[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] (d.1908), the founder of the [[Ahmadiyya]] movement, identified Gog and Magog with the European powers that had emerged from the [[Slavs|Slavic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] peoples respectively, with particular reference to their political duplicity and shattering of world peace.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite book|last=Wessels|first=Anton|title=The Torah, the Gospel, and the Qur'an: Three Books, Two Cities, One Tale|year=2013|publisher=Wm.

==Modern apocalypticism==
In the early 19th century, some [[Hasidic Judaism|Chasidic]] [[rabbi]]s identified the [[French invasion of Russia]] under [[Napoleon]] as \"The War of Gog and Magog\".{{sfn|Wessels|2013|p=205}} But as the century progressed, apocalyptic expectations receded as the populace in Europe began to adopt an increasingly secular worldview.{{sfn|Kyle|2012|pp=34–35}} This has not been the case in the United States, where a 2002 poll indicated that 59% of Americans believed the events predicted in the Book of Revelation would come to pass.{{sfn|Filiu|2011|p=196}} During the [[Cold War]] the idea that [[Soviet Russia]] had the role of Gog gained popularity, since Ezekiel's words describing him as \"prince of Meshek\"—''rosh meshek'' in Hebrew—sounded suspiciously like Russia and Moscow.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|1996|p=178}} Even some Russians took up the idea, apparently unconcerned by the implications (\"Ancestors were found in the Bible, and that was enough\"), as did [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Boyer |first=Paul|title=When Time Shall Be No More: Prophecy Belief in Modern Culture |publisher=Belknap Press |year=1992 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FyTeW7vQ8K4C&pg=PR1|ref=harv|isbn=9780674028616 |page=162}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Marsh |first=Christopher |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-xlLFUegIBQC&pg=PA254 |title=Religion and the State in Russia and China |publisher=A&C Black |ref=harv|isbn=9781441112477 |page=254}}</ref>

Some post-Cold War [[Millenarianism|millenarians]] still identify Gog with Russia, but they now tend to stress its allies among Islamic nations, especially [[Iran]].{{sfn|Kyle|2012|p=171}} For the most fervent, the countdown to [[Armageddon]] began with the [[Aliyah|return of the Jews to Israel]], followed quickly by further signs pointing to the nearness of the final battle—nuclear weapons, [[European integration]], Israel's reunification of Jerusalem in the Six Day War in 1967, and America's wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and the [[Persian Gulf]].{{sfn|Kyle|2012|p=4}} In the prelude to the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]], President [[George W. Bush]] told [[Jacques Chirac]], \"Gog and Magog are at work in the Middle East\". \"This confrontation\", he urged the French leader, \"is willed by God, who wants to use this conflict to erase His people's enemies before a new age begins\".{{r|jean-edward-smith}} Chirac consulted a professor at the Faculty of Theology of the [[University of Lausanne]] to explain Bush's reference.{{sfn|Wessels|2013|pp=193, fn 6}}

In the Islamic apocalyptic tradition, the end of the world would be preceded by the release of Gog and Magog, whose destruction by God in a single night would usher in the Day of Resurrection.{{sfn|Cook|2005|pp=8, 10}} Reinterpretation did not generally continue after Classical times, but the needs of the modern world have produced a new body of apocalyptic literature in which Gog and Magog are identified as Communist Russia and China.{{sfn|Cook|2005|pp=12, 47, 206}} One problem these writers have had to confront is the barrier holding Gog and Magog back, which is not to be found in the modern world: the answer varies, some writers saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are invisible.{{sfn|Cook|2005|pp=205–206}}

'''Gog and Magog''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ɒ|g|...|ˈ|m|eɪ|g|ɒ|g}}; {{lang-he-n|גּוֹג וּמָגוֹג}}; ''Gog u-Magog,'' [[Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|{{Nastaliq|يأجوج ومأجوج}}}}; ''Yaʾjūj wa-Maʾjūj'') appear in the [[Hebrew Bible]], often know as the Old Testament, and [[Quran]] 21:96 as individuals, tribes, or lands. In [[Ezekiel 38]], Gog is an individual and Magog is his land;{{sfn|Lust|1999b|pp=373–374}} in Genesis 10 Magog is a man, but no Gog is mentioned; and centuries later Jewish tradition changed Ezekiel's \"Gog ''from'' Magog\" into \"Gog ''and'' Magog\",{{r|boring}} which is the form in which they appear in the Christian New Testament's [[Book of Revelation]], although there they are peoples rather than individuals.{{r|mounce}}

A legend was attached to Gog and Magog by the time of the [[Pax Romana|Roman period]], that the [[Gates of Alexander]] were erected by [[Alexander the Great]] to repel the tribe. Romanized Jewish historian [[Josephus]] knew them as the nation descended from Magog the [[Japhetites|Japhetite]], as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], and explained them to be the [[Scythians]]. In the hands of Early Christian writers they became apocalyptic hordes, and throughout the Medieval period variously identified as the [[Vikings]], [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Mongols]], [[Ural-Altaic race|Turanians]] or other [[Eurasian nomads|nomads]], or even the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of [[Israelites|Israel]].

The legend of Gog and Magog and the gates were also interpolated into the [[Alexander romance]]s. In one version, \"Goth and Magothy\" (that means Muralla in Maranaw people) are kings of the Unclean Nations, driven beyond a mountain pass by Alexander, and blocked from returning by his new wall. Gog and Magog are said to engage in [[human cannibalism]] in the romances and derived literature. They have also been depicted on Medieval cosmological maps, or ''[[mappa mundi|mappae mundi]]'', sometimes alongside Alexander's wall.

The conflation of Gog and Magog with the legend of Alexander and the Iron Gates was disseminated throughout the Near East in the early centuries of the Christian and Islamic era.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=123}} They appear in the [[Quran]] in chapter [[Al-Kahf]] as Yajuj and Majuj ({{Lang-ar|{{Nastaliq|يأجوج ومأجوج}}}}; {{transl|ar|DIN|Yaʾjūj wa-Maʾjūj}}), primitive and immoral tribes that were separated and barriered off by [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] (possessor of the Two Horns), who is mentioned in the Qu'ran as a great righteous ruler and conqueror.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=57, fn 3}} Many modern Muslim historians and geographers regarded the [[Vikings]] as the emergence of Gog and Magog.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b4MjAQAAMAAJ&q=vikings+and+gog+and+magog&dq=vikings+and+gog+and+magog&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj40viCj_zkAhWHgVwKHRsQAaoQ6AEINzAC|title=Kings and Vikings: Scandinavia and Europe, A.D. 700-1100|first=P. H.|last=Sawyer|date=April 10, 1982|publisher=Methuen|via=Google Books}}</ref> In contemporary times they remain associated with apocalyptic thinking, especially in [[Israel]] and the [[Muslim world]].

==The names Gog and Magog==
{{Eschatology}}
The names are mentioned together in [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] [[Ezekiel 38|chapter 38]], where Gog is an individual and Magog is his land.{{sfn|Lust|1999b|pp=373–374}} The meaning of the name Gog remains uncertain, and in any case, the author of the Ezekiel prophecy seems to attach no particular importance to it.{{sfn|Lust|1999b|pp=373–374}} Efforts have been made to identify him with various individuals, notably [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]], a king of [[Lydia]] in the early 7th century BC, but many scholars do not believe he is related to any historical person.{{sfn|Lust|1999b|pp=373–374}} 

In [[Genesis 10]] Magog is a person, son of [[Japheth]] son of [[Noah]], but no Gog is mentioned. The name Magog is equally obscure, but may come from the Assyrian ''mat-Gugu'', \"Land of Gyges\", i.e., Lydia.{{r|gmirkin}} Alternatively, Gog may be derived from Magog rather than the other way round, and \"Magog\" may be code for [[Babylon]].{{efn|The encryption technique is called ''[[atbash]]''. BBL (\"Babylon\") when read backwards and displaced by one letter becomes MGG (Magog).}}{{sfn|Lust|1999a|p=536}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Bøe|2001|loc=pp. 84, fn 31}}. Lust and Bøe cite Brownlee (1983) \"Son of Man Set Your Face: Ezekiel the Refugee Prophet\", ''HUCA'' '''54'''.</ref>

The form \"Gog and Magog\" may have emerged as shorthand for \"Gog and/of the land of Magog\", based on their usage in the [[Septuagint]], the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible.{{sfn|Buitenwerf|2007|p=166}} An example of this combined form in Hebrew (''Gog u-Magog'') has been found, but its context is unclear, being preserved only in a fragment of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].{{efn|4Q523 scroll}}{{sfn|Buitenwerf|2007|p=172}} In Revelation, Gog and Magog together are the hostile nations of the world.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|pp=89–90}}{{r|mounce}} Gog or Goug the [[Reubenite]]{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|All Reubenites are held to be descendants of Reuben in the view of the Torah, but it is unclear what family relationship Gog's father Joel has with the sons of Reuben in verse 3.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|p=49}}}} occurs in [[1 Chronicles]] {{bibleverse-nb|1 Chronicles|5:4|KJV}}, but he appears to have no connection with the Gog of Ezekiel or Magog of Genesis.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|p=1}}

The Biblical \"Gog and Magog\" possibly gave derivation of the name [[Gogmagog (giant)|Gogmagog]], a legendary British giant.{{efn|The giant mentioned by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (1136 AD).<!--Simpson & Roud (2000)-->}}<ref>{{citation|last1=Simpson |first1=Jacqueline |last2=Roud |first2=Stephen |author-link1=Jacqueline Simpson |author-link2=Steve Roud |title=Oxford Dictionary of English Folklore |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |at=Gogmagog (or Gog and Magog) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTcdvd1iRXsC&pg=PT409 |isbn=9780192100191}}</ref> A later corrupted folk rendition in print altered the tradition around Gogmagog and [[Corineus]] with two giants Gog and Magog, with whom the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] statues came to be identified.<ref>{{citation|last=Fairholt |first=Frederick William  |author-link=Frederick William Fairholt |title=Gog and Magog: The Giants in Guildhall; Their Real and Legendary History |publisher=John Camden Hotten |year=1859 |pages=8–11, 130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VoQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA8}}</ref>

==Judeo-Christian texts==
{{Christian Eschatology}}

===In Ezekiel and the Old Testament===
[[File:Flemish - Ezekiel's Vision of the Sign \"Tau\" (Ezekiel IX -2-7) - Walters 44616 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Ezekiel's Vision of the Sign \"Tau\" from Ezekiel IX:2–7. {{right|{{small|—[[Mosan art|Mosan]] [[champlevé]] panel, mid-12th century.}}}}]]

The [[Book of Ezekiel]] records a series of visions received by the prophet [[Ezekiel]], a priest of [[Solomon's Temple]], who was among the captive during the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]]. The exile, he tells his fellow captives, is [[God in Judaism|God]]'s punishment on Israel for turning away, but God will restore his people to [[Jerusalem]] when they return to him.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|1996|p=178}} After this message of reassurance, chapters [[Wikisource:Bible (World English)/Ezekiel#Chapter 38|38–39]], the Gog oracle, tell how Gog of Magog and his hordes will threaten the restored Israel but will be destroyed, after which God will establish a new Temple and dwell with his people for a period of lasting peace (chapters 40–48).{{r|bullock}} 

<blockquote>\"Son of man, direct your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince, leader of [[Meshech]] and [[Tubal]], and prophesy concerning him. Say: Thus said the Lord: Behold, I am against you, Gog, the prince, leader of Meshech and Tubal&nbsp;... Persia, [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]] and Put will be with you&nbsp;... also [[Gomer]] with all its troops, and Beth [[Togarmah]] from the far north with all its troops—the many nations with you.\"<!-- passage is dialogue, don't remove quotation marks --><ref>{{Bibleverse | Ezekiel | 38 | NRSV}} (NRSV)</ref></blockquote>

Internal evidence indicates that the Gog oracle was composed substantially later than the chapters around it.{{efn|Composed between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC<!--Tooman (2011), p. 271-->}}{{sfn|Tooman|2011|p=271}}Of Gog's allies, Meshech and Tubal were 7th-century kingdoms in central [[Anatolia]] north of Israel, Persia towards east, Cush (Ethiopia) and Put (Libya) to the south; Gomer is the [[Cimmerians]], a nomadic people north of the Black Sea, and Beth Togarmah was on the border of Tubal.{{sfn|Block|1998|pp=72–73, 439–440}} The confederation thus represents a multinational alliance surrounding Israel.{{r|hays-duvall-pate}} \"Why the prophet's gaze should have focused on these particular nations is unclear,\" comments Biblical scholar [[Daniel I. Block]], but their remoteness and reputation for violence and mystery possibly \"made Gog and his confederates perfect symbols of the archetypal enemy, rising against God and his people\".{{sfn|Block|1998|p=436}} One explanation is that the Gog alliance, a blend of the \"[[Generations of Noah|Table of Nations]]\" in Genesis 10 and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]'s trading partners in Ezekiel 27, with Persia added, was cast in the role of end-time enemies of Israel by means of Isaiah 66:19, which is another text of eschatological foretelling.{{sfn|Tooman|2011|pp=147–148}}

Although the prophecy refers to Gog as an enemy in some future, it is not clear if the confrontation is meant to occur in a final \"[[End of Days (eschatology)|end of days]]\" since the Hebrew term ''aḥarit ha-yamim'' ({{lang-he-n|אחרית הימים}}) may merely mean \"latter days\", and is open to interpretation. Twentieth-century scholars have used the term to denote the [[eschaton]] in a malleable sense, not necessarily meaning final days, or tied to the Apocalypse.<!--p.94-->{{efn|Tooman's view is that the \"latter days\" means \"the end of history-as-we-know-it and the initiation of a new historical age\".<!--Tooman, p.96-->}}{{sfn|Tooman|2011|pp=94–97}} Still, the Utopia of chapters 40–48 can be spoken of in the parlance of \"true [[eschatology|eschatological]] character, given that it is a product of \"cosmic conflict\" described in the immediately preceding Gog chapters.{{r|petersen}}

The Septuagint reads \"Agag\" instead of \"Gog\" in Numbers 24:7.

Over the next few centuries Jewish tradition changed Ezekiel's Gog ''from'' Magog into Gog ''and'' Magog.{{r|boring}} The process, and the shifting geography of Gog and Magog, can be traced through the literature of the period. The 3rd book of the [[Sibylline Oracles]], for example, which originated in Egyptian Judaism in the middle of the 2nd century BC,{{r|wardle}} changes Ezekiel's \"Gog from Magog\" to \"Gog and Magog\", links their fate with up to eleven other nations, and places them \"in the midst of [[Aethiopia]]n rivers\"; this seems a strange location, but ancient geography did sometimes place Ethiopia next to Persia or even India.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|pp=142–144}} The passage has a highly uncertain text, with manuscripts varying in their groupings of the letters of the Greek text into words, leading to different readings; one group of manuscripts (\"group Y\") links them with the \"[[Moesia|Marsians]] and [[Dacia]]ns\", in eastern Europe, amongst others.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|pp=145–146}}

The [[Book of Jubilees]], from about the same time, makes three references to either Gog or Magog: in the first, Magog is a descendant of Noah, as in Genesis 10; in the second, Gog is a region next to Japheth's borders; and in the third, a portion of Japheth's land is assigned to Magog.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|p=153}} The 1st-century [[Pseudo-Philo|''Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum'']], which retells Biblical history from Adam to Saul, is notable for listing and naming seven of Magog's sons, and mentions his \"thousands\" of descendants.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|pp=186–189}} The [[Samaritan Torah]] and the [[Septuagint]] (a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible made during the last few centuries of the pre-Christian era) occasionally introduce the name of Gog where the Hebrew original has something else, or use Magog where the Hebrew has Gog, indicating that the names were interchangeable.{{sfn|Lust|1999a|pp=536–537}}

Chapters 19:11–21:8 of the [[Book of Revelation]], dating from the end of the 1st century AD,{{r|stuckenbruck}} tells how [[Satan]] is to be imprisoned for a thousand years, and how, on his release, he will rally \"the nations in the four corners of the Earth, Gog and Magog\", to a final battle with Christ and his saints:{{r|mounce}}

<blockquote>When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the Earth—Gog and Magog—and to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore.<ref>{{Bibleverse | Revelation | 20:7–10 | NIV}} (NIV)</ref></blockquote>

===Midrashic writings===
The anti-Roman [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in the 2nd century AD looked to a human leader as the promised [[messiah]], but after its failure Jews began to conceive of the messianic age in supernatural terms: first would come a forerunner, the [[Messiah ben Joseph]], who would defeat Israel's enemies, identified as Gog and Magog, to prepare the way for the [[Jewish messianism|Messiah ben David]];{{Refn|group=lower-alpha|The coming of the Messiah ben David \"is contemporary with or just after that of Messiah ben Joseph\" (van der Woude (1974), p. 527).{{sfn|Bøe|2001|p=201}}}} then the dead would rise, divine judgement would be handed out, and the righteous would be rewarded.{{r|shengold-jewish-encyclopedia}}{{sfn|Bøe|2001|pp=201–204}}

The [[aggadah]], homiletic and non-legalistic exegetical texts in the [[classical rabbinic literature]] of [[Judaism]], treat Gog and Magog as two names for the same nation who will come against Israel in the final war.{{sfn|Skolnik|Berenbaum|2007|p=684}} The rabbis associated no specific nation or territory with them beyond a location to the north of Israel,<ref>[[Mikraot Gedolot]] HaMeor p. 400</ref> but the great Jewish scholar [[Rashi]] identified the Christians as their allies and said God would thwart their plan to kill all Israel.{{r|grossman}}

The 1st-century Jewish historian [[Josephus]] identified the Gog and Magog people as [[Scythians]], horse-riding barbarians from around the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and the [[Sea of Azov]]. Josephus recounts the tradition that Gog and Magog were locked up by Alexander the Great behind [[Gates of Alexander|iron gates]] in the \"Caspian Mountains\", generally identified with the [[Caucasus]] Mountains. This legend must have been current in contemporary Jewish circles by this period, coinciding with the beginning of the Christian Era.{{efn|1=Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D1%3Awhiston%20chapter%3D6%3Awhiston%20section%3D1 1.123] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D18%3Awhiston+chapter%3D4%3Awhiston+section%3D4 18.97]; ''[[The Jewish War]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0148%3Abook%3D7%3Awhiston%20chapter%3D7%3Awhiston%20section%3D4 7.244–51]}}{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=122}} Several centuries later, this material was vastly elaborated in the ''[[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]'' and [[Alexander romance]].{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|pp=122–125}}

===Precursor texts in Syriac===
The ''Pseudo-Methodius'', written originally in Syriac, is considered the source of Gog and Magog tale incorporated into Western versions of the Alexander Romance.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=30}}{{sfn|Stoneman|1991|p=29}} An earlier-dated Syriac ''Alexander Legend'' contains a somewhat different treatment of the Gog and Magog material, which passed into the lost Arabic version,{{sfn|Boyle|1979|p=123}} or the Ethiopic and later Oriental versions of the Alexander romance.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=32}}{{efn|The Ethiopic version derives from the lost Arabic version ({{harvnb|Boyle|1979|p=133}}).

In the Syriac ''Alexander Legend'' dating to 629–630, Gog ({{lang-syr|ܓܘܓ|}}, gwg) and Magog ({{lang-syr|ܡܓܘܓ}}ܵ, mgwg) appear as kings of [[Huns|Hunnish]] nations.{{efn|Also called ''Christian Legend concerning Alexander'', ed. tr. by E.

Gog and Magog also appear in [[Thomas de Kent]]'s ''Roman de toute chevalerie'' (c. 1180), where they are portrayed as cave-dwellers who consume human flesh.

==Identification with civilisations==
Early Christian writers (e.g. [[Eusebius]]) frequently identified Gog and Magog with the Romans and their emperor.{{sfn|Lust|1999b|p=375}} After the Empire became Christian, [[Ambrose]] (d. 397) identified Gog with the [[Goths]], [[Jerome]] (d. 420) with the [[Scythians]], and [[Jordanes]] (died c. 555) said that Goths, Scythians and [[Amazons]] were all the same; he also cited Alexander's gates in the Caucasus.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=125}}{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|The idea that Gog and Magog were connected with the Goths was longstanding; in the mid-16th century, Archbishop of Uppsala [[Johannes Magnus]] traced the royal family of [[Sweden]] back to Magog son of Japheth, via Suenno, progenitor of the Swedes, and Gog, ancestor of the Goths).{{r|derry}}}} The [[Byzantine]] writer [[Procopius]] said it was the Huns Alexander had locked out, and a Western monk named Fredegar seems to have Gog and Magog in mind in his description of savage hordes from beyond Alexander's gates who had assisted the Byzantine emperor Heraclius (610–641) against the Muslim [[Saracens]].{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|pp=125–126}}

===Nomadic identification===
As one nomadic people followed another on the Eurasian steppes, so the identification of Gog and Magog shifted. In the 9th and 10th centuries these kingdoms were identified by some with the lands of the [[Khazars]], a Turkic people who had converted to Judaism and whose empire dominated Central Asia–the 9th-century monk [[Christian of Stavelot]] referred to Gazari, said of the Khazars that they were \"living in the lands of Gog and Magog\" and noted that they were \"circumcised and observing all [the laws of] Judaism\".{{sfn|Brook|2006|pp=7–8, 96}}{{sfn|Westrem|1998|p=65}} Arab traveler ibn Fadlan also reported of this belief, writing around 921 he recorded that \"Some hold the opinion that Gog and Magog are the Khazars\".{{sfn|Brook|2006|p=8}}

After the Khazars came the [[Mongols]], seen as a mysterious and invincible horde from the east who destroyed Muslim empires and kingdoms in the early 13th century; kings and popes took them for the legendary [[Prester John]], marching to save Christians from the Muslim [[Saracens]], but when they entered Poland and Hungary and annihilated Christian armies a terrified Europe concluded that they were \"Magogoli\", the offspring of Gog and Magog, released from the prison Alexander had constructed for them and heralding [[Armageddon]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=12, 120–122, 144}}

[[Europeans in Medieval China]] reported findings from their travels to the [[Mongol Empire]]. Some accounts and maps began to place the \"Caspian Mountains\", and Gog and Magog, just outside the [[Great Wall of China]]. The ''[[Tartar Relation]]'', an obscure account of Friar Carpini's 1240s journey to Mongolia, is unique in alleging that these Caspian Mountains in Mongolia, \"where the Jews called Gog and Magog by their fellow countrymen are said to have been shut in by Alexander\", were moreover purported by the Tartars to be magnetic, causing all iron equipment and weapons to fly off toward the mountains on approach.{{r|painter}} In 1251, the French friar [[André de Longjumeau]] informed his king that the Mongols originated from a desert further east, and an apocalyptic Gog and Magog (\"Got and Margoth\") people dwelled further beyond, confined by the mountains.{{sfn|William of Rubruck|Rockhill (tr.)|1900|pp=xxi, fn 2}}

In fact, Gog and Magog were held by the Mongol to be their ancestors, at least by some segment of the population. As traveler and Friar [[Riccoldo da Monte di Croce]] put it in c. 1291, \"They say themselves that they are descended from Gog and Magog: and on this account they are called ''Mogoli'', as if from a corruption of ''Magogoli''\".{{sfn|Boyle|1979|p=126}}{{Sfn|Marco Polo|Yule (tr.)|1875|pp=285, fn 5}}{{sfn|Westrem|1998|pp=66–67}} [[Marco Polo]], traveling when the initial terror had subsided, places Gog and Magog among the [[Tartars]] in [[Hohhot|Tenduc]], but then claims that the names Gog and Magog are translations of the place-names Ung and Mungul, inhabited by the Ung and Mongols respectively.{{Sfn|Marco Polo|Yule (tr.)|1875|pp=276–286}}{{r|strickland}}

<!--Even if Gog and Magog were considered ancestors, this location of Gog and Magog seems too far east.-->An explanation offered by Orientalist [[Henry Yule]] was that Marco Polo was only referring to the \"Rampart of Gog and Magog\", a name for the Great Wall of China.{{sfn|Marco Polo|Yule (tr.)|1875|pp=283, fn 5}} Friar André's placement of Gog and Magog far east of Mongolia has been similarly explained.{{sfn|William of Rubruck|Rockhill (tr.)|1900|pp=xxi, fn 2}}

===The confined Jews===
Some time around the 12th century, the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of Israel came to be identified with Gog and Magog;{{sfn|Gow|1995|pp=23–24}} possibly the first to do so was [[Petrus Comestor]] in ''Historica Scholastica'' (c. 1169–1173),{{sfn|Gow|1995|p=42}}{{sfn|Boyle|1979|p=124}} and he was indeed a far greater influence than others before him, although the idea had been anticipated by the aforementioned Christian of Stavelot, who noted that the Khazhars, to be identified with Gog and Magog, was one of [[Seven chieftains of the Magyars|seven tribes of the Hungarians]] and had converted to Judaism.{{sfn|Brook|2006|pp=7–8, 96}}{{sfn|Westrem|1998|p=65}}

While the confounding Gog and Magog as confined Jews was becoming commonplace, some, like Riccoldo or [[Vincent de Beauvais]] remained skeptics, and distinguished the Lost Tribes from Gog and Magog.{{sfn|Boyle|1979|p=126}}{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=134}}{{sfn|Gow|1995|pp=56–57}} As noted, Riccoldo had reported a Mongol folk-tradition that they were descended from Gog and Magog. He also addressed many minds (Westerners or otherwise{{sfn|Westrem|1998|p=66}}) being credulous of the notion that Mongols might be Captive Jews, but after weighing the pros and cons, he concluded this was an open question.{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|Riccoldo observed that the Mongol script resembled Chaldean ([[Syriac language|Syriac]],{{Sfn|Marco Polo|Yule (tr.)|1875|pp=58, fn 3}} a form of [[Aramaic]]), and in fact it does derive from Aramaic.{{sfn|Boyle|1979|p=125, note 19}} However, he saw that Mongols bore no physical resemblance to Jews and were ignorant of Jewish laws.}}{{sfn|Westrem|1998|pp=66–67}}{{Sfn|Marco Polo|Yule (tr.)|1875|pp=58, fn 3}}

The Flemish Franciscan friar [[William of Rubruck]], who was first-hand witness to Alexander's [[Fortifications of Derbent|supposed wall]] in [[Derbent]] on the shores of the Caspian Sea in 1254,{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|Rubruck refers Derbent as the \"Iron Gate\", this also being the meaning of the Turkish name (Demir kapi) for the town.{{Sfn|William of Rubruck|Rockhill (tr.)|1900|pp=xlvi, 262 note 1}} Rubruck may have been the only medieval Westerner to claim to have seen it.{{sfn|Westrem|1998|p=66}}}} identified the people the walls were meant to fend off only vaguely as \"wild tribes\" or \"desert nomads\",{{efn|Also \"barbarous nations\", \"savage tribes\".}}{{sfn|William of Rubruck|Rockhill (tr.)|1900|pp=xlvi, 100, 120, 122, 130, 262–263 and fn}} but one researcher made the inference Rubruck must have meant Jews,{{efn|Based on Rubruck stating elsewhere \"There are other enclosures in which there are Jews\"}} and that he was speaking in the context of \"Gog and Magog\".{{efn|Since [[Roger Bacon]], having been informed by Rubruck, urged the study of geography to discover where the [[Antichrist]] and Gog and Magog might be found.}}{{sfn|Westrem|1998|p=66}} Confined Jews were later to be referred to as \"[[Red Jews]]\" (''die roten Juden'') in German-speaking areas; a term first used in a [[Holy Grail]] epic dating to the 1270s, in which Gog and Magog were two mountains enclosing these people.{{efn|[[Albrecht von Scharfenberg]], ''Der jüngere Titurel''. It belongs in the [[Arthurian cycle]].}}{{sfn|Gow|1995|pp=70–71}}

The author of the ''[[John Mandeville|Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]'', a 14th-century best-seller, said he had found these Jews in Central Asia where as Gog and Magog they had been imprisoned by Alexander, plotting to escape and join with the Jews of Europe to destroy Christians.{{sfn|Westrem|1998|pp=68–69}}

Two chapters [[Al-Kahf|''Al Kahf'']] and ''[[Al-Anbiya]]'' of the [[Quran]] discuss Gog and Magog. In the Quran Yajuj and Majuj (Gog and Magog) are suppressed by Dhul-Qarnayn \"the two-horned one\"; this figure is often thought to be derived from either Alexander the Great or [[Cyrus the Great in the Quran|Cyrus the Great]], though there has been no consensus on this.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=57, fn 3}} Dhul-Qarnayn, having journeyed to the ends of the world, meets \"a people who scarcely understood a word\" who seek his help in building a barrier that will separate them from the people of Yajuj and Majuj who \"do great mischief on earth\". He agrees to build it for them, but warns that when the time comes (Last Age), Allah will remove the barrier and Yajuj and Majuj will swarm through.<!--{{sfn|Hughes|1895|p=148}}-->{{r|dict-islam}}[[File:Quran Surah Al Kahf.png|thumb|Surah Al Kahf Story of Gog and Magog |316x316px]]The early Muslim traditions were summarised by [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] (d. 1283) in two popular works called the Cosmography and the Geography. Gog and Magog, he says, live near to the sea that encircles the Earth and can be counted only by God; they are only half the height of a normal man, with claws instead of nails and a hairy tail and huge hairy ears which they use as mattress and cover for sleeping.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=65–68}} They scratch at their wall each day until they almost break through. They break for the night saying tomorrow we will finish, and each night God restores it. Then one day, as they stop scratching for the night, one will say tomorrow we will finish God Willing, and in the morning, it is not restored as with everything night. When they do break through they will be so numerous that \"their vanguard is in [[Syria]] and their rear in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]\".{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=74}}

Various nations and peoples in history were identified as Ya'juj and Ma'juj. At one point, it was the Turks, who threatened [[Baghdad]] and northern Iran;{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=82–84}} later, when the Mongols destroyed Baghdad in 1258, it was they who were Gog and Magog.{{sfn|Filiu|2011|p=30}} The wall dividing them from civilised peoples was normally placed towards [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], but in the year 842 the [[Caliph]] [[Al-Wathiq]] had a dream in which he saw that it had been breached, and sent an official named Sallam to investigate may be related [[Ergenekon]].{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=xvii–xviii, 82}} Sallam returned a little over two years later and reported that he had seen the wall and also the tower where Dhul Qarnayn had left his building equipment, and all was still intact.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=xvii–xviii, 244}} It is not entirely clear what Sallam saw, but he may have reached the [[Jade Gate]] and the westernmost customs point on the border of China.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=xvii–xviii}} Somewhat later the 14th-century traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] reported that the wall was sixty days' travel from the city of [[Quanzhou|Zeitun]], which is on the coast of China; the translator notes that Ibn Battuta has confused the [[Great Wall of China]] with that built by [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] .{{r|gibb-beckingham}}

According to Shia sources, Yajooj and Majooj are not from the Children of Adam (the human race). Al-Kafi, one of their primary collections of ahadith, states that it has been narrated from [[Ibn Abbas]] that when he asked [[Ali]] about the \"creatures\", he responded by saying God has created \"1,200 species on the land, 1,200 species in the sea, 70 species from the Children of Adam and the people are the Children of Adam except for the Yajooj and Majooj\".<ref name= \"Kulayni\">{{cite book |last1=al-Kulayni |first1=Muhammad ibn Ya‘qūb |title=Al-Kafi |date=2015 |publisher=Islamic Seminary Incorporated |location=NY |isbn=9780991430864 |edition=Volume 8 }}</ref> This is in contradiction with many reports in Sunni sources, including those in [[Sahih Al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]], which indicate they will indeed, be from the Children of Adam, and this is the belief of the overwhelming majority of Islamic scholars. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linktoislam.net/islamic-articles/article.aspx?id=40|title=Story of Ya'juj and Ma'juj (Gog and Magog) form The Quran - Link To Islam|website=www.linktoislam.net}}</ref>

According to [[Sahih Muslim]], the Prophet said:

''Then a people whom Allah had protected from him (dajjal) would come to Isa, son of Maryam (alaihimas salam), and he would wipe their faces and would inform them of their ranks in Paradise and it would be under such conditions that Allah would reveal to Isa (alaihis salam) these words: I have brought forth from amongst My servants such people against whom none would be able to fight; you take these people safely to Tur, and then Allah would send Gog and Magog and they would swarm down from every slope. The first of them would pass the lake of Tiberias and drink out of it. And when the last of them would pass, he would say: There was once water there.'' 

Some scholars further attempt to relate the last portion of the interpretation of Yajuj and Majuj to the lake of Tiberias, currently known as the [[Sea of Galilee]], the [[Earth]]'s lowest freshwater lake, and the Dead Sea.<ref>[[Sahih Muslim]], 2937, The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour</ref>

Bush]] told [[Jacques Chirac]], \"Gog and Magog are at work in the Middle East\". \"This confrontation\", he urged the French leader, \"is willed by God, who wants to use this conflict to erase His people's enemies before a new age begins\".{{r|jean-edward-smith}} Chirac consulted a professor at the Faculty of Theology of the [[University of Lausanne]] to explain Bush's reference.{{sfn|Wessels|2013|pp=193, fn 6}}

In the Islamic apocalyptic tradition, the end of the world would be preceded by the release of Gog and Magog, whose destruction by God in a single night would usher in the Day of Resurrection.{{sfn|Cook|2005|pp=8, 10}} Reinterpretation did not generally continue after Classical times, but the needs of the modern world have produced a new body of apocalyptic literature in which Gog and Magog are identified as Communist Russia and China.{{sfn|Cook|2005|pp=12, 47, 206}} One problem these writers have had to confront is the barrier holding Gog and Magog back, which is not to be found in the modern world: the answer varies, some writers saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are invisible.{{sfn|Cook|2005|pp=205–206}}

It covers a land area of {{convert|617|km2|abbr=in}} and reported a population of 165,595 in the 2010 census.<ref name=census>{{cite web|url=http://192.147.231.244:9090/stats/index.php/statistics/population |title=Population & Vital Statistics |publisher=Central Statistics Office of St. Lucia |accessdate=18 November 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119182317/http://192.147.231.244:9090/stats/index.php/statistics/population |archivedate=19 November 2016 }}</ref> Its capital is [[Castries]].

The French were the island's first European settlers. They signed a treaty with the native [[Island Caribs]] in 1660. England took control of the island from 1663 to 1667. In ensuing years, it was at war with France fourteen times, and the rule of the island changed frequently (it was ruled seven times each by the French and British). In 1814, the British took definitive control of the island. Because it switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the \"Helen of the West Indies\" after the Greek mythological character, [[Helen of Troy]].

Representative government came about in 1840 (universal [[suffrage]] was established in 1953). From 1958 to 1962, the island was a member of the [[West Indies Federation]]. On 22 February 1979, Saint Lucia became an independent state and a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name=\"GovC\">

==History==
{{main|History of Saint Lucia}}

===Pre-colonial period===
The first proven inhabitants were the [[Taino people|Arawak]]s, though there may have been other native peoples prior to this. The Arawak are believed to have come from northern [[South America]] sometime around 200–400 [[AD]], as there are numerous [[archeology|archaeological]] sites on the island where specimens of their well-developed [[pottery]] have been found. There is evidence to suggest that the Arawak called the island ''Iouanalao'', meaning 'Land of the Iguanas', due to the island's high number of [[iguana]]s.<ref name=AllAbout>[http://www.allaboutstlucia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121 All about St Lucia: ''History'']</ref>

The more aggressive [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] arrived around 800 AD, and seized control from the Arawaks by killing their men and assimilating the women into their own society.<ref name=AllAbout/> They called the island ''Hewanarau'', and later ''Hewanorra'' (Ioüanalao, or \"there where iguanas are found\").{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|p=10}}

===Early European period===
[[Christopher Columbus]] may have sighted the island during his fourth voyage in 1502, since he made landfall on [[Martinique]], yet he does not mention the island in his log. [[Juan de la Cosa]] noted the island on his map of 1500, calling it El Falcon, and another island to the south Las Agujas. A Spanish [[Cedula|cédula]] from 1511 mentions the island within the Spanish domain, and a globe in the Vatican made in 1520, shows the island as Sancta Lucia.

In the late 1550s, the French [[pirate]] [[François le Clerc]] (known as ''Jambe de Bois'', due to his wooden leg) set up a camp on [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]], from where he attacked passing Spanish ships. In 1605, an English vessel called the ''Oliphe Blossome'' was blown off-course on its way to [[Guyana]], and the 67 colonists started a settlement on Saint Lucia, after initially being welcomed by the Carib chief Anthonie. By 26 September 1605 only 19 survived following continued attacks by the Carib chief Augraumart, so the settlers fled the island.{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=16–21}}

===French colony===
{{Main|French West Indies}}

In 1664, Thomas Warner (son of [[Thomas Warner (explorer)|Sir Thomas Warner]], the governor of [[St Kitts]]) claimed Saint Lucia for England. He brought 1,000 men to defend it from the French, but after two years, only 89 survived with the rest dying mostly due to disease. In 1666, the [[French West India Company]] resumed control of the island, which in 1674 was made an official French crown colony as a dependency of Martinique.<ref name=Statesmen>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Saint_Lucia.html World Statesmen: ''Saint Lucia Chronology''] Linked 2014-01-20</ref>

===18th and 19th centuries===
{{Main|British West Indies|British Windward Islands}}

Both the British and the French found the island attractive after the slave-based sugar industry developed, and during the 18th century the island changed ownership or was declared neutral territory a dozen times, although the French settlements remained and the island was a de facto French colony well into the eighteenth century.

In 1722, [[George I of Great Britain]] granted both Saint Lucia and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] to [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu|The 2nd Duke of Montagu]]. He in turn appointed [[Nathaniel Uring]], a merchant sea captain and adventurer, as deputy-governor. Uring went to the islands with a group of seven ships, and established settlement at Petit Carenage. Unable to get enough support from British warships, he and the new colonists were quickly run off by the French.<ref>{{DNB|wstitle=Montagu, John (1688?-1749)|first=Henry Manners |last=Chichester|volume=38}}</ref>

During the [[Seven Years' War]], Britain occupied Saint Lucia for a year. Britain handed the island back to the French at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. Like the English and Dutch on other islands, the French began to develop the land for the cultivation of sugar cane as a commodity crop on large plantations in 1765.

In January 1791, during the [[French Revolution]], the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] sent four ''commissaires'' to St Lucia to spread their revolutionary philosophy. By August 1791, slaves began to abandon their estates and Governor de Gimat fled.  In December 1792, Lt. [[Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse]] arrived with revolutionary pamphlets, and the impoverished whites and free people of color began to arm themselves as ''patriots''. On 1 February 1793, France declared war on England and Holland, and General [[Nicolas Xavier de Ricard]] took over as Governor.  The [[National Convention]] abolished enslavement on 4 February 1794, but St. Lucia fell to a British invasion led by Vice Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|John Jervis]] on 1 April 1794. [[Morne Fortune]] became ''Fort Charlotte''. Soon, a patriot army of resistance, ''L'Armee Française dans les Bois'', began to fight back.  Thus started the [[First Brigand War]].{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=60–65}}

A short time later the British invaded the island as a part of the recently broken out war with France. On 21 February 1795 and a group of locals under the nominal control of [[Victor Hugues]] defeated a battalion of British troops at Vieux Fort and Rabot. In 1796, [[Castries]] was burned as part of the conflict. [[John Moore (British Army officer)|General John Moore]] retook Fort Charlotte in 1796 with the [[27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot|27th Inniskilling Fusiliers]] after two days of bitter fighting. As an honour, the Fusiliers' regimental colour was displayed on the flagstaff of the captured fortress at [[Morne Fortune]] for an hour before being replaced by the [[Union Jack]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Trimble|first=Copeland|title=Historical record of the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment from the period of its institution as a volunteer corps till the present time|publisher=William Clowes|year=1876|url=https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog/page/n83 49]}}</ref> Moore would then participate in British efforts to repress the slave rebels until falling ill of [[yellow fever]], upon which he returned to Britain before 1798.

In 1803, the British regained control of the island. Many of the rebels escaped into the thick rainforest where they evaded capture and established [[maroon communities]].<ref>''They Called Us the Brigands. The Saga of St. Lucia's Freedom Fighters'' by Robert J Devaux</ref>

The slavery on the island was continued for a short time, but anti-slavery sentiment was rising in Britain. The British stopped the import of slaves by anyone, white or coloured, when they [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolished the slave trade]] in 1807.

France and Great Britain continued to contest Saint Lucia until the British secured it in 1814, as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] ending the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Thereafter, Saint Lucia was considered part of the [[British Windward Islands]] colony.

The institution of slavery was abolished on the island in 1836, as it was throughout the [[British Empire]]. After abolition, all former slaves had to serve a four-year \"apprenticeship,\" to accustom them to the idea of freedom. During this period, they worked for their former masters for at least three-quarters of the work week. Full freedom was duly granted by the British in 1838. By that time, people of African ethnicity greatly outnumbered those of ethnic European background. Some people of Carib descent also comprised a minority on the island.

Castries' harbour was protected by a system of 60 surrounding forts. Along the top of Morne Fortune there are six military sites, building work by the French started in 1768, and the British completed the work by 1890. They include Fort Charlotte (Old Morne Fortress), the Apostle's Battery (1888–1890), The Powder Magazine built by the French in the 1750s, Provost's [[Redoubt]] (1792) built as a lookout point, and the Combermere [[barracks]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Sarah|title=St Lucia & Dominica Footprint Focus Guide: Includes Fort-de-France ...|date=2013|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=9781909268319|page=32|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9MH9AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA32&dq=bagshaw%20st%20lucia&pg=PA32#v=onepage&q=bagshaw%20st%20lucia&f=false|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>

The best preserved installation is a battery at La Toc Point, completed in 1888 it was not abandoned till 1905. This fort in particular was built by the British to repel any attack from the United States on the then valuable [[Coaling (ships)|coaling harbour]] of Castries.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Sarah|title=St Lucia & Dominica Footprint Focus Guide: Includes Fort-de-France ...|date=2013|page=33}}</ref>

===20th and 21st centuries===
{{see also|West Indies Federation}}

The [[Second World War]] visited the island directly during the [[Battle of the Caribbean]], when a German [[U-boat]] attacked and sank two British ships in [[Castries]] harbour on 9 March 1942.<ref name=Hubbard>{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=Vincent|title=A History of St. Kitts|date=2002|publisher=Macmillan Caribbean|isbn=9780333747605|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofstkitts00vinc/page/117 117]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofstkitts00vinc/page/117}}</ref>{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|p=275}}

In the mid-twentieth century, Saint Lucia joined the [[West Indies Federation]] (1958–1962) when the colony was dissolved. In 1967, Saint Lucia became one of the six members of the West Indies Associated States, with internal self-government. In 1979, it gained full independence under [[Sir John Compton]] of the conservative [[United Workers Party (Saint Lucia)|United Workers party (UWP)]]. The new country chose to remain within the [[British Commonwealth]] and to retain Queen Elizabeth as [[Monarchy of Saint Lucia|Monarch]], represented locally by a [[Governor-General of Saint Lucia|Governor-General]].

===Post-independence era===
Compton's initial term as Prime Minister lasted only a few months, as he was defeated by the left-leaning [[Saint Lucia Labour Party]] (SLP) under [[Allan Louisy]] in the [[1979 Saint Lucian general election]].<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1210528.stm|title=Timeline: St Lucia|work=[[BBC Online]]|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 July 2010 | date=29 October 2009}}</ref> The SLP sought to improve ties with socialist countries in the region such as [[Cuba]], though the economy was severely affected by [[Hurricane Allen]] in 1980.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica – St Lucia\">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Saint-Lucia |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – St Lucia |accessdate= 30 June 2019}}</ref> Louisy was replaced as Prime Minister by [[Winston Cenac]] in 1981.

==Geology==
[[File:USGS Saint Lucia geologic map.png|thumb|Saint Lucia [[geologic map]], where Tmov denotes [[Miocene]]/[[Oligocene]] volcanic rocks, Tplv are [[Pliocene]] [[calc-alkaline magma series|calc-alkaline volcanic rocks]], and Qv are [[Quaternary]] volcanic edifices, flows, and pyroclastic deposits.]]
[[File:Qualibou Caldera tomography.png|thumb|Topography of the Soufriere Volcanic Complex]]
The geology of St. Lucia can be described as composing three main areas.  The oldest, 16–18 [[Megaannum|Ma]], [[volcanic]] rocks are exposed from Castries northward and consist of [[eroded]] [[basalt]] and [[andesite]] centres.  The middle, central highlands, portion of the island consists of dissected andesite centres, 10.4 to 1 Mya, while the lower southwest portion of the island contains recent activity from the Soufriere Volcanic Centre (SVC).  This SVC, centered about the [[Qualibou]] [[caldera|depression]], contains [[pyroclastic flow]] deposits, [[lava flow]]s, [[intrusive rock|domes]], [[block and ash flow]] deposits, and [[volcanic crater|explosion craters]].  This depression's perimeter includes the town of Soufriere, Mount Tabac, Mt. Gimie, Morne Bonin, and Gros Piton.  At {{convert|10|km}} in diameter, though the western portion is open towards the Grenada [[basin (geology)|basin]], the depression formed as recently as 100 kya.  The depression is noted for its [[geothermal gradient|geothermal activity]], especially at [[Sulphur Springs, Saint Lucia|Sulphur Springs]] and [[Soufrière Estate]]s, a [[phreatic eruption]] in 1776, and recent [[seismic activity]] (2000–2001).<ref name=\"Lindsay\">{{cite journal|last1=Lindsay|first1=Jan|last2=Trumbull|first2=Robert|last3=Schmitt|first3=Axel|last4=Stockli|first4=Daniel|last5=Shane|first5=Phil|last6=Howe|first6=Tracy|title=Volcanic stratigraphy and geochemistry of the Soufriere Volcanic Centre, Saint Lucia with implications for volcanic hazards|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|date=2013|volume=258|pages=126–142|doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2013.04.011}}</ref>

Eroded andesitic [[stratovolcano]]es to the north east of the depression include Mt. Gimie, Piton St Esprit, and Mt. Grand Magazin, all greater than 1 Ma in age.  Andesitic and [[dacite]] pyroclastic flows from these volcanoes are found at Morne Tabac dome (532 [[kiloannus|ka]]), Morne Bonin dome (273 kya), and Bellevue (264 kya). [[Avalanche]] deposits from the formation of the Qualibou depression are found offshore, and in the massive blocks of Rabot, Pleisance, and Coubaril.  The dacitic domes of [[Petit Piton]] (109 kya) and [[Gros Piton]] (71 kya) were then [[extrusive rock|extruded]] onto the depression floor accompanied by the Anse John (104 kya) and La Pointe (59.8 kya) pyroclastic flows.  Later, pyroclastic flows include [[pumice]]-rich Belfond and Anse Noir (20 kya).  Finally, the dacitic domes of Terre Blanche (15.3 kya) and Belfond (13.6 kya) formed within the depression.<ref name=Lindsay/>

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Saint Lucia}}
[[File:St. Lucia Export Treemap.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of St. Lucia's exports.]]

The [[United Nations]] categorizes Saint Lucia as a [[Small Island Developing States|Small Island Developing State]], a designation similar to a [[developing country]] with a few substantial differences due to Saint Lucia's island nature.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/topics/sids |title=Small Island Developing States |accessdate=13 March 2018 |publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Division for Sustainable Development |location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/topics/sids/list |title=List of Small Island Developing States |accessdate=13 March 2018 |publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Division for Sustainable Development |location=New York}}</ref> The [[tertiary sector of the economy|services sector]] accounted for 82.8% of GDP, followed by [[industry]] and [[agriculture]] at 14.2% and 2.9%, respectively.<ref name=\"CIAStLucia\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/st.html |title=Saint Lucia |accessdate=13 March 2018 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |work=CIA World Factbook}}</ref>

An educated workforce and improvements in roads, communications, water supply, sewerage, and port facilities have attracted foreign investment in tourism and in petroleum storage and transshipment. However, with the US, Canada, and Europe in recession, tourism declined by double digits in early 2009. The recent change in the [[European Union]] import preference regime and the increased competition from Latin American bananas have made economic diversification increasingly important in Saint Lucia.

Saint Lucia has been able to attract foreign business and investment, especially in its offshore banking and tourism industries, which is Saint Lucia's main source of revenue. The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area, and the government is trying to revitalise the banana industry. Despite negative growth in 2011, economic fundamentals remain solid, and GDP growth should recover in the future.

Inflation has been relatively low, averaging 5.5 percent between 2006 and 2008. Saint Lucia's currency is the [[East Caribbean Dollar]] (EC$), a regional currency shared among members of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECU). The [[Eastern Caribbean Central Bank]] (ECCL) issues the EC$, manages monetary policy, and regulates and supervises commercial banking activities in member countries. In 2003, the government began a comprehensive restructuring of the economy, including elimination of price controls and privatization of the state banana company.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/Index/Country/SaintLucia |title=Saint Lucia Economy: Population, GDP, Inflation, Business, Trade, FDI, Corruption |publisher=Heritage.org |accessdate=21 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220014738/http://www.heritage.org/index/Country/SaintLucia |archive-date=20 February 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Tourism===
{{Main|Tourism in Saint Lucia}}
[[File:At_the_top_of_Pigeon_Island.jpg|thumb|Gros Islet and Rodney Bay as seen from Pigeon Island]]
Tourism is vital to Saint Lucia's economy. Its economic importance is expected to continue to increase as the market for bananas have become more competitive. Tourism tends to be more substantial during the dry season (January to April), often referred to as the tourist season. Saint Lucia tends to be popular due to its tropical weather and scenery and its numerous beaches and resorts.

Other tourist attractions include a drive-in [[volcano]], [[Sulphur Springs, Saint Lucia|Sulphur Springs]] (in Soufrière), zip lining in beautiful [https://www.world-of-waterfalls.com/waterfalls/caribbean-sault-falls/ Sault Falls], Dennery, the [[St Lucia Botanical Gardens|Botanical Gardens]], the Majestic twin Peaks \"The Pitons\", a world heritage site, the rain forests, several options of boat trips, Frigate Island Nature Reserve (Operated by the St. Lucia National Trust), Dennery, and Pigeon Island National Park, which is home to Fort Rodney, an old British military base.

The majority of tourists visit Saint Lucia as part of a cruise. Most of their time tends to be spent in [[Castries]], although [[Soufrière, Saint Lucia|Soufriere]], [[Marigot Bay]], [[Rodney Bay]] and [[Gros Islet]] are popular locations to visit.

The current Minister of Tourism is [[Dominic Fedee]], he has been in his role since 2016.

Saint Lucia reported a population of 165,595 in the 2010 national census.<ref name=census/> In {{UN_Population|Year}}, the [[United Nations Population Division]] estimated Saint Lucia's population at {{UN_Population|Saint Lucia}}.{{UN_Population|ref}} The country's population is evenly divided between urban and rural areas, with more than a third living in the capital, Castries.

Despite a high emigration rate, the population is growing rapidly at about 1.2% per year. Migration from Saint Lucia is primarily to [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] countries, with the United Kingdom having almost 10,000 Saint Lucian-born citizens, and over 30,000 of Saint Lucian heritage. The second most popular destination for Saint Lucian émigrés is the United States, where a combined (foreign and national-born Saint Lucians) almost 14,000 reside. Canada is home to a few thousand Saint Lucians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/23/34792376.xls |title=Oecd.org |accessdate=4 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617032129/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/23/34792376.xls |archivedate=17 June 2009 }}</ref>

{{Main|Culture of Saint Lucia}}
[[File:Day250castriesreduxd.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Saint Lucia Jazz Festival]] in [[Castries]].]]

The culture of Saint Lucia has been influenced by African, East Indian, French, and English heritage. One of the secondary languages is [[Saint Lucian French Creole|Saint Lucian French Creole or Kwéyòl]], spoken by almost all of the population.<ref name=\"sltb-about\" /><ref name=\"usstate-bgnote\" />

Saint Lucia boasts the second highest ratio of [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureates produced with respect to the total population of any sovereign country in the world. Two winners have come from Saint Lucia: [[William Arthur Lewis (economist)|Sir Arthur Lewis]] won the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize in Economics]] in 1979, and the poet [[Derek Walcott]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1992.

===Festivals===
Saint Lucian cultural festivals include [[La Woz|La Rose]] and [[La Magwit|La Marguerite]], the first representing a native Saint Lucian fraternal society known as the Order of the Rose that is fashioned in the mould of [[Rosicrucianism]], and the second representing its traditional rival, the native Saint Lucian equivalent of [[Freemasonry]] known as the Order of the Marguerite.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.flightstostlucia.com/culture-of-st-lucia |title=St. Lucia Culture |publisher=Flights To St Lucia |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref> References to their origins as versions of pre-existing external secret societies can be seen in a mural painted by Dunstan St Omer, depicting the holy trinity of [[Osiris]], [[Horus]], and [[Isis]].

The biggest festival of the year is the [[Saint Lucia Jazz Festival]].  Held in early May at multiple venues throughout the island, it draws visitors and musicians from around the world.

Traditionally in common with other Caribbean countries, Saint Lucia held a [[carnival]] before [[Lent]]. In 1999, the government moved Carnival to mid-July to avoid competing with the much larger [[Trinidad and Tobago carnival]] and so as to attract more overseas visitors.

In May 2009, Saint Lucians commemorated the 150th Anniversary of West Indian Heritage on the island.

===Cuisine===
{{Further|Saint Lucian cuisine}}

Saint Lucia's national dish is green figs and saltfish.

The island's cuisine is a unique blend of West African {{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}, European (mainly British and French) and East Indian cuisine; this creates dynamic meal dishes such as [[macaroni pie]], Stew chicken, [[rice and peas]], fish broth or fish water, and [[soups]] packed full with fresh locally produced vegetables. Typical essential foodstuffs are potatoes, onions, [[celery]], [[thyme]], [[coconut milk]], the very hot [[Scotch bonnet|scotch bonnet peppers]], flour, and cornmeal. All mainstream meat and poultry are eaten in St. Lucia; meat and seafood are normally stewed and browned to create a rich gravy sometimes served over [[ground provisions]] or rice. The island is also home to the famous fried dough, known by many as a bake or Johnny Cake. These bakes can be served with different sides, such as saltfish which is either sautéed or lightly fried along with red, green peppers, onions, and seasoned well. This is the most common way for bake to be prepared, though it can also be served with meats such as stewed chicken or beef.

One popular Saint Lucian dessert is the pastry called a turnover. The pastry is made with sweetened coconut that is boiled with spices, some sugar, and whatever is satisfying. It is boiled until cooked to a light or dark brown colour; then the mixture is separated into various size portions placed on a rolled out piece of dough. The dough size may vary too depending on how much is desired, and lastly, it is baked in the oven until the colour of the turnover is nicely browned.

Due to Saint Lucia's Indo-Caribbean population, curry is very popular; however due to the blend of cooking styles, curry dishes have a distinct Caribbean twist. Roti is typically served as a fast food meal: the bread itself is very flat (sometimes very thin) and is wrapped around curried vegetables such as chickpeas and potato, seafood such as shrimp and conch, or meats such as chicken, beef, goat, and liver.

===LGBTQ non-acceptance===
[[LGBT rights in Saint Lucia|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people living in Saint Lucia]] face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT members of the population.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Avery |title=71 Countries Where Homosexuality is Illegal |url=https://www.newsweek.com/73-countries-where-its-illegal-be-gay-1385974 |work=Newsweek |date=4 April 2019}}</ref> Saint Lucia prohibits male-on-male sexual activity, punishing those found guilty with 10 years in jail.

Part of the [[Lesser Antilles]], it is located north/northeast of the island of [[Saint Vincent (Antilles)|Saint Vincent]], northwest of [[Barbados]] and south of [[Martinique]]. It covers a land area of {{convert|617|km2|abbr=in}} and reported a population of 165,595 in the 2010 census.<ref name=census>{{cite web|url=http://192.147.231.244:9090/stats/index.php/statistics/population |title=Population & Vital Statistics |publisher=Central Statistics Office of St. Lucia |accessdate=18 November 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119182317/http://192.147.231.244:9090/stats/index.php/statistics/population |archivedate=19 November 2016 }}</ref> Its capital is [[Castries]].

The French were the island's first European settlers. They signed a treaty with the native [[Island Caribs]] in 1660. England took control of the island from 1663 to 1667. In ensuing years, it was at war with France fourteen times, and the rule of the island changed frequently (it was ruled seven times each by the French and British). In 1814, the British took definitive control of the island. Because it switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the \"Helen of the West Indies\" after the Greek mythological character, [[Helen of Troy]].

Representative government came about in 1840 (universal [[suffrage]] was established in 1953). From 1958 to 1962, the island was a member of the [[West Indies Federation]]. On 22 February 1979, Saint Lucia became an independent state and a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name=\"GovC\">

==History==
{{main|History of Saint Lucia}}

===Pre-colonial period===
The first proven inhabitants were the [[Taino people|Arawak]]s, though there may have been other native peoples prior to this. The Arawak are believed to have come from northern [[South America]] sometime around 200–400 [[AD]], as there are numerous [[archeology|archaeological]] sites on the island where specimens of their well-developed [[pottery]] have been found. There is evidence to suggest that the Arawak called the island ''Iouanalao'', meaning 'Land of the Iguanas', due to the island's high number of [[iguana]]s.<ref name=AllAbout>[http://www.allaboutstlucia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121 All about St Lucia: ''History'']</ref>

The more aggressive [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] arrived around 800 AD, and seized control from the Arawaks by killing their men and assimilating the women into their own society.<ref name=AllAbout/> They called the island ''Hewanarau'', and later ''Hewanorra'' (Ioüanalao, or \"there where iguanas are found\").{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|p=10}}

===Early European period===
[[Christopher Columbus]] may have sighted the island during his fourth voyage in 1502, since he made landfall on [[Martinique]], yet he does not mention the island in his log. [[Juan de la Cosa]] noted the island on his map of 1500, calling it El Falcon, and another island to the south Las Agujas. A Spanish [[Cedula|cédula]] from 1511 mentions the island within the Spanish domain, and a globe in the Vatican made in 1520, shows the island as Sancta Lucia.

In the late 1550s, the French [[pirate]] [[François le Clerc]] (known as ''Jambe de Bois'', due to his wooden leg) set up a camp on [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]], from where he attacked passing Spanish ships. In 1605, an English vessel called the ''Oliphe Blossome'' was blown off-course on its way to [[Guyana]], and the 67 colonists started a settlement on Saint Lucia, after initially being welcomed by the Carib chief Anthonie. By 26 September 1605 only 19 survived following continued attacks by the Carib chief Augraumart, so the settlers fled the island.{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=16–21}}

===French colony===
{{Main|French West Indies}}

In 1664, Thomas Warner (son of [[Thomas Warner (explorer)|Sir Thomas Warner]], the governor of [[St Kitts]]) claimed Saint Lucia for England. He brought 1,000 men to defend it from the French, but after two years, only 89 survived with the rest dying mostly due to disease. In 1666, the [[French West India Company]] resumed control of the island, which in 1674 was made an official French crown colony as a dependency of Martinique.<ref name=Statesmen>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Saint_Lucia.html World Statesmen: ''Saint Lucia Chronology''] Linked 2014-01-20</ref>

===18th and 19th centuries===
{{Main|British West Indies|British Windward Islands}}

Both the British and the French found the island attractive after the slave-based sugar industry developed, and during the 18th century the island changed ownership or was declared neutral territory a dozen times, although the French settlements remained and the island was a de facto French colony well into the eighteenth century.

In 1722, [[George I of Great Britain]] granted both Saint Lucia and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] to [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu|The 2nd Duke of Montagu]]. He in turn appointed [[Nathaniel Uring]], a merchant sea captain and adventurer, as deputy-governor. Uring went to the islands with a group of seven ships, and established settlement at Petit Carenage. Unable to get enough support from British warships, he and the new colonists were quickly run off by the French.<ref>{{DNB|wstitle=Montagu, John (1688?-1749)|first=Henry Manners |last=Chichester|volume=38}}</ref>

During the [[Seven Years' War]], Britain occupied Saint Lucia for a year. Britain handed the island back to the French at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. Like the English and Dutch on other islands, the French began to develop the land for the cultivation of sugar cane as a commodity crop on large plantations in 1765.

In January 1791, during the [[French Revolution]], the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] sent four ''commissaires'' to St Lucia to spread their revolutionary philosophy. By August 1791, slaves began to abandon their estates and Governor de Gimat fled.  In December 1792, Lt. [[Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse]] arrived with revolutionary pamphlets, and the impoverished whites and free people of color began to arm themselves as ''patriots''. On 1 February 1793, France declared war on England and Holland, and General [[Nicolas Xavier de Ricard]] took over as Governor.  The [[National Convention]] abolished enslavement on 4 February 1794, but St. Lucia fell to a British invasion led by Vice Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|John Jervis]] on 1 April 1794. [[Morne Fortune]] became ''Fort Charlotte''. Soon, a patriot army of resistance, ''L'Armee Française dans les Bois'', began to fight back.  Thus started the [[First Brigand War]].{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=60–65}}

A short time later the British invaded the island as a part of the recently broken out war with France. On 21 February 1795 and a group of locals under the nominal control of [[Victor Hugues]] defeated a battalion of British troops at Vieux Fort and Rabot. In 1796, [[Castries]] was burned as part of the conflict. [[John Moore (British Army officer)|General John Moore]] retook Fort Charlotte in 1796 with the [[27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot|27th Inniskilling Fusiliers]] after two days of bitter fighting. As an honour, the Fusiliers' regimental colour was displayed on the flagstaff of the captured fortress at [[Morne Fortune]] for an hour before being replaced by the [[Union Jack]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Trimble|first=Copeland|title=Historical record of the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment from the period of its institution as a volunteer corps till the present time|publisher=William Clowes|year=1876|url=https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog/page/n83 49]}}</ref> Moore would then participate in British efforts to repress the slave rebels until falling ill of [[yellow fever]], upon which he returned to Britain before 1798.

In 1803, the British regained control of the island. Many of the rebels escaped into the thick rainforest where they evaded capture and established [[maroon communities]].<ref>''They Called Us the Brigands. The Saga of St. Lucia's Freedom Fighters'' by Robert J Devaux</ref>

The slavery on the island was continued for a short time, but anti-slavery sentiment was rising in Britain. The British stopped the import of slaves by anyone, white or coloured, when they [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolished the slave trade]] in 1807.

France and Great Britain continued to contest Saint Lucia until the British secured it in 1814, as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] ending the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Thereafter, Saint Lucia was considered part of the [[British Windward Islands]] colony.

The institution of slavery was abolished on the island in 1836, as it was throughout the [[British Empire]]. After abolition, all former slaves had to serve a four-year \"apprenticeship,\" to accustom them to the idea of freedom. During this period, they worked for their former masters for at least three-quarters of the work week. Full freedom was duly granted by the British in 1838. By that time, people of African ethnicity greatly outnumbered those of ethnic European background. Some people of Carib descent also comprised a minority on the island.

Castries' harbour was protected by a system of 60 surrounding forts. Along the top of Morne Fortune there are six military sites, building work by the French started in 1768, and the British completed the work by 1890. They include Fort Charlotte (Old Morne Fortress), the Apostle's Battery (1888–1890), The Powder Magazine built by the French in the 1750s, Provost's [[Redoubt]] (1792) built as a lookout point, and the Combermere [[barracks]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Sarah|title=St Lucia & Dominica Footprint Focus Guide: Includes Fort-de-France ...|date=2013|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=9781909268319|page=32|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9MH9AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA32&dq=bagshaw%20st%20lucia&pg=PA32#v=onepage&q=bagshaw%20st%20lucia&f=false|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>

The best preserved installation is a battery at La Toc Point, completed in 1888 it was not abandoned till 1905.

===20th and 21st centuries===
{{see also|West Indies Federation}}

The [[Second World War]] visited the island directly during the [[Battle of the Caribbean]], when a German [[U-boat]] attacked and sank two British ships in [[Castries]] harbour on 9 March 1942.<ref name=Hubbard>{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=Vincent|title=A History of St. Kitts|date=2002|publisher=Macmillan Caribbean|isbn=9780333747605|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofstkitts00vinc/page/117 117]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofstkitts00vinc/page/117}}</ref>{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|p=275}}

In the mid-twentieth century, Saint Lucia joined the [[West Indies Federation]] (1958–1962) when the colony was dissolved. In 1967, Saint Lucia became one of the six members of the West Indies Associated States, with internal self-government. In 1979, it gained full independence under [[Sir John Compton]] of the conservative [[United Workers Party (Saint Lucia)|United Workers party (UWP)]]. The new country chose to remain within the [[British Commonwealth]] and to retain Queen Elizabeth as [[Monarchy of Saint Lucia|Monarch]], represented locally by a [[Governor-General of Saint Lucia|Governor-General]].

===Post-independence era===
Compton's initial term as Prime Minister lasted only a few months, as he was defeated by the left-leaning [[Saint Lucia Labour Party]] (SLP) under [[Allan Louisy]] in the [[1979 Saint Lucian general election]].<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1210528.stm|title=Timeline: St Lucia|work=[[BBC Online]]|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 July 2010 | date=29 October 2009}}</ref> The SLP sought to improve ties with socialist countries in the region such as [[Cuba]], though the economy was severely affected by [[Hurricane Allen]] in 1980.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica – St Lucia\">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Saint-Lucia |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – St Lucia |accessdate= 30 June 2019}}</ref> Louisy was replaced as Prime Minister by [[Winston Cenac]] in 1981.

The capital city of Saint Lucia is [[Castries]] (population 60,263) where 32.4% of the population lives. Other major towns include [[Gros Islet]], [[Soufrière, Saint Lucia|Soufrière]], and [[Vieux Fort]]. The population tends to be concentrated around the coast, with the interior more sparsely populated.<ref name=\"CIA World Factbook – St Lucia\"/><ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica – St Lucia\"/>

===Climate===
The local climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]], specifically a [[tropical rainforest climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]], moderated by northeast [[trade winds]], with a dry season from 1 December to 31 May, and a wet season from 1 June to 30 November.

Average daytime temperatures are around {{convert|30|C|F|1|abbr=on}}, and average nighttime temperatures are around {{convert|24|C|F|1|abbr=on}}. Since it is fairly close to the equator, the temperature does not fluctuate much between winter and summer.

[[File:Qualibou Caldera tomography.png|thumb|Topography of the Soufriere Volcanic Complex]]
The geology of St. Lucia can be described as composing three main areas.  The oldest, 16–18 [[Megaannum|Ma]], [[volcanic]] rocks are exposed from Castries northward and consist of [[eroded]] [[basalt]] and [[andesite]] centres.  The middle, central highlands, portion of the island consists of dissected andesite centres, 10.4 to 1 Mya, while the lower southwest portion of the island contains recent activity from the Soufriere Volcanic Centre (SVC).  This SVC, centered about the [[Qualibou]] [[caldera|depression]], contains [[pyroclastic flow]] deposits, [[lava flow]]s, [[intrusive rock|domes]], [[block and ash flow]] deposits, and [[volcanic crater|explosion craters]].  This depression's perimeter includes the town of Soufriere, Mount Tabac, Mt. Gimie, Morne Bonin, and Gros Piton.  At {{convert|10|km}} in diameter, though the western portion is open towards the Grenada [[basin (geology)|basin]], the depression formed as recently as 100 kya.  The depression is noted for its [[geothermal gradient|geothermal activity]], especially at [[Sulphur Springs, Saint Lucia|Sulphur Springs]] and [[Soufrière Estate]]s, a [[phreatic eruption]] in 1776, and recent [[seismic activity]] (2000–2001).<ref name=\"Lindsay\">{{cite journal|last1=Lindsay|first1=Jan|last2=Trumbull|first2=Robert|last3=Schmitt|first3=Axel|last4=Stockli|first4=Daniel|last5=Shane|first5=Phil|last6=Howe|first6=Tracy|title=Volcanic stratigraphy and geochemistry of the Soufriere Volcanic Centre, Saint Lucia with implications for volcanic hazards|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|date=2013|volume=258|pages=126–142|doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2013.04.011}}</ref>

Eroded andesitic [[stratovolcano]]es to the north east of the depression include Mt. Gimie, Piton St Esprit, and Mt. Grand Magazin, all greater than 1 Ma in age.  Andesitic and [[dacite]] pyroclastic flows from these volcanoes are found at Morne Tabac dome (532 [[kiloannus|ka]]), Morne Bonin dome (273 kya), and Bellevue (264 kya). [[Avalanche]] deposits from the formation of the Qualibou depression are found offshore, and in the massive blocks of Rabot, Pleisance, and Coubaril.  The dacitic domes of [[Petit Piton]] (109 kya) and [[Gros Piton]] (71 kya) were then [[extrusive rock|extruded]] onto the depression floor accompanied by the Anse John (104 kya) and La Pointe (59.8 kya) pyroclastic flows.  Later, pyroclastic flows include [[pumice]]-rich Belfond and Anse Noir (20 kya).  Finally, the dacitic domes of Terre Blanche (15.3 kya) and Belfond (13.6 kya) formed within the depression.<ref name=Lindsay/>

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Saint Lucia}}
[[File:St. Lucia Export Treemap.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of St. Lucia's exports.]]

The [[United Nations]] categorizes Saint Lucia as a [[Small Island Developing States|Small Island Developing State]], a designation similar to a [[developing country]] with a few substantial differences due to Saint Lucia's island nature.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/topics/sids |title=Small Island Developing States |accessdate=13 March 2018 |publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Division for Sustainable Development |location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/topics/sids/list |title=List of Small Island Developing States |accessdate=13 March 2018 |publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Division for Sustainable Development |location=New York}}</ref> The [[tertiary sector of the economy|services sector]] accounted for 82.8% of GDP, followed by [[industry]] and [[agriculture]] at 14.2% and 2.9%, respectively.<ref name=\"CIAStLucia\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/st.html |title=Saint Lucia |accessdate=13 March 2018 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |work=CIA World Factbook}}</ref>

An educated workforce and improvements in roads, communications, water supply, sewerage, and port facilities have attracted foreign investment in tourism and in petroleum storage and transshipment. However, with the US, Canada, and Europe in recession, tourism declined by double digits in early 2009. The recent change in the [[European Union]] import preference regime and the increased competition from Latin American bananas have made economic diversification increasingly important in Saint Lucia.

Saint Lucia has been able to attract foreign business and investment, especially in its offshore banking and tourism industries, which is Saint Lucia's main source of revenue. The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area, and the government is trying to revitalise the banana industry. Despite negative growth in 2011, economic fundamentals remain solid, and GDP growth should recover in the future.

Inflation has been relatively low, averaging 5.5 percent between 2006 and 2008. Saint Lucia's currency is the [[East Caribbean Dollar]] (EC$), a regional currency shared among members of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECU). The [[Eastern Caribbean Central Bank]] (ECCL) issues the EC$, manages monetary policy, and regulates and supervises commercial banking activities in member countries. In 2003, the government began a comprehensive restructuring of the economy, including elimination of price controls and privatization of the state banana company.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/Index/Country/SaintLucia |title=Saint Lucia Economy: Population, GDP, Inflation, Business, Trade, FDI, Corruption |publisher=Heritage.org |accessdate=21 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220014738/http://www.heritage.org/index/Country/SaintLucia |archive-date=20 February 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Tourism===
{{Main|Tourism in Saint Lucia}}
[[File:At_the_top_of_Pigeon_Island.jpg|thumb|Gros Islet and Rodney Bay as seen from Pigeon Island]]
Tourism is vital to Saint Lucia's economy. Its economic importance is expected to continue to increase as the market for bananas have become more competitive. Tourism tends to be more substantial during the dry season (January to April), often referred to as the tourist season. Saint Lucia tends to be popular due to its tropical weather and scenery and its numerous beaches and resorts.

Other tourist attractions include a drive-in [[volcano]], [[Sulphur Springs, Saint Lucia|Sulphur Springs]] (in Soufrière),zip lining in beautiful [https://www.world-of-waterfalls.com/waterfalls/caribbean-sault-falls/ Sault Falls], Dennery, the [[St Lucia Botanical Gardens|Botanical Gardens]], the Majestic twin Peaks \"The Pitons\", a world heritage site, the rain forests, several options of boat trips, Frigate Island Nature Reserve (Operated by the St. Lucia National Trust), Dennery, and Pigeon Island National Park, which is home to Fort Rodney, an old British military base.

The majority of tourists visit Saint Lucia as part of a cruise. Most of their time tends to be spent in [[Castries]], although [[Soufrière, Saint Lucia|Soufriere]], [[Marigot Bay]], [[Rodney Bay]] and [[Gros Islet]] are popular locations to visit.

The current Minister of Tourism is [[Dominic Fedee]], he has been in his role since 2016.

{{Main|Culture of Saint Lucia}}
[[File:Day250castriesreduxd.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Saint Lucia Jazz Festival]] in [[Castries]].]]

The culture of Saint Lucia has been influenced by African, East Indian, French, and English heritage. One of the secondary languages is [[Saint Lucian French Creole|Saint Lucian French Creole or Kwéyòl]], spoken by almost all of the population.<ref name=\"sltb-about\" /><ref name=\"usstate-bgnote\" />

Saint Lucia boasts the second highest ratio of [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureates produced with respect to the total population of any sovereign country in the world. Two winners have come from Saint Lucia: [[William Arthur Lewis (economist)|Sir Arthur Lewis]] won the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize in Economics]] in 1979, and the poet [[Derek Walcott]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1992.

===Festivals===
Saint Lucian cultural festivals include [[La Woz|La Rose]] and [[La Magwit|La Marguerite]], the first representing a native Saint Lucian fraternal society known as the Order of the Rose that is fashioned in the mould of [[Rosicrucianism]], and the second representing its traditional rival, the native Saint Lucian equivalent of [[Freemasonry]] known as the Order of the Marguerite.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.flightstostlucia.com/culture-of-st-lucia |title=St. Lucia Culture |publisher=Flights To St Lucia |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref> References to their origins as versions of pre-existing external secret societies can be seen in a mural painted by Dunstan St Omer, depicting the holy trinity of [[Osiris]], [[Horus]], and [[Isis]].

The biggest festival of the year is the [[Saint Lucia Jazz Festival]].  Held in early May at multiple venues throughout the island, it draws visitors and musicians from around the world. The grand finale or main stage is held at the [[Pigeon Island Island National Landmark (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131014185536/http://www.tropicalsky.co.uk/blog/st-lucia-jazz-festival/ St Lucia Jazz Festival]. tropicalsky.co.uk (20 April 2009)</ref> which is located to the North of the Island.

Traditionally in common with other Caribbean countries, Saint Lucia held a [[carnival]] before [[Lent]]. In 1999, the government moved Carnival to mid-July to avoid competing with the much larger [[Trinidad and Tobago carnival]] and so as to attract more overseas visitors.

In May 2009, Saint Lucians commemorated the 150th Anniversary of West Indian Heritage on the island.

===Cuisine===
{{Further|Saint Lucian cuisine}}

Saint Lucia's national dish is green figs and saltfish.

The island's cuisine is a unique blend of West African {{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}, European (mainly British and French) and East Indian cuisine; this creates dynamic meal dishes such as [[macaroni pie]], Stew chicken, [[rice and peas]], fish broth or fish water, and [[soups]] packed full with fresh locally produced vegetables. Typical essential foodstuffs are potatoes, onions, [[celery]], [[thyme]], [[coconut milk]], the very hot [[Scotch bonnet|scotch bonnet peppers]], flour, and cornmeal. All mainstream meat and poultry are eaten in St. Lucia; meat and seafood are normally stewed and browned to create a rich gravy sometimes served over [[ground provisions]] or rice. The island is also home to the famous fried dough, known by many as a bake or Johnny Cake. These bakes can be served with different sides, such as saltfish which is either sautéed or lightly fried along with red, green peppers, onions, and seasoned well. This is the most common way for bake to be prepared, though it can also be served with meats such as stewed chicken or beef.

One popular Saint Lucian dessert is the pastry called a turnover. The pastry is made with sweetened coconut that is boiled with spices, some sugar, and whatever is satisfying. It is boiled until cooked to a light or dark brown colour; then the mixture is separated into various size portions placed on a rolled out piece of dough. The dough size may vary too depending on how much is desired, and lastly, it is baked in the oven until the colour of the turnover is nicely browned.

Due to Saint Lucia's Indo-Caribbean population, curry is very popular; however due to the blend of cooking styles, curry dishes have a distinct Caribbean twist. Roti is typically served as a fast food meal: the bread itself is very flat (sometimes very thin) and is wrapped around curried vegetables such as chickpeas and potato, seafood such as shrimp and conch, or meats such as chicken, beef, goat, and liver.

===LGBTQ non-acceptance===

'''Otto Kretschmer''' (1 May 1912 – 5 August 1998) was a German naval officer and [[submarine]]r in [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]].

From September 1939 until his surrender in March 1941, he sank 47 ships, a total of 274,333 tons. For this he received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]], among other awards. He earned the nickname \"Silent Otto\" both for his successful use of the \"[[Silent running (submarine)|silent running]]\" capability of U-boats as well as for his reluctance to transmit radio messages during patrols. After the war, he served in the German Federal Navy and retired in 1970 with the rank of ''Flottillenadmiral'' (flotilla admiral).

==Early life and career==
Kretschmer was born in [[Hajduki Nyskie|Heidau]] near [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]], then in the [[German Empire]] on 1 May 1912 to Friedrich Wilhelm Otto and Alice new Herbig.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=1}} His father was a teacher at the local ''Volkschule'' ([[primary school]]) where Otto attended from 1918–1921. He then moved to a ''Realgymnasium'' ([[secondary school]]).{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=1}} In the aftermath of [[World War I]] the Kretschmer family remained aloof from the political turbulence of the [[Weimar era]]. Kretschmer indulged in sporting pastimes and scientific interests. Kretschmer achieved good results in mathematics and chemistry and passed his ''[[Abitur]]'' (school-leaving certificate) at 17. The report contained the remark, \"Kretschmer demonstrated his extraordinary courage in many instances. He wants to be a naval officer.\"{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=2}} Kretschmer was too young to enlist at 17 and his father sent him to [[England]] to broaden his horizons. He enrolled at [[Exeter University]] (then University College of the South West of England) and studied under Professor Jacob Wilhelm Schopp (b. 1871), a German–born naturalised Briton. He mastered the [[English language]] and came to respect British education, its practical focus complemented his scientific and theoretical–based German background. His time in England shaped his view of them during the war; he was quick to believe in rumours of new British inventions during the war at sea.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=2–4}} He returned home upon his mother's death from tetanus in a medical malpractice incident. He did not return to England from his hiatus, but travelled through [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Italy]].{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=2–4}}

===''Reichsmarine''===

Kretschmer entered the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' (Weimar Navy) on 1 April 1930 as ''See Offizier Anwärter'' (naval officer cadet). Kretschmer formed part of \"Crew 30\" (the incoming class of 1930), 78–strong intake of officer candidates.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=3}} He underwent basic military training in the 2nd department of the standing ship division of the [[Baltic Sea]] in [[Stralsund]] (1 April 1930&nbsp;– 30 June 1930).<ref group=Tr>2nd department —II. ''Abteilung''</ref><ref group=Tr>standing ship division —''Schiffsstammdivision''</ref> Kretschmer was then transferred to the [[training ship]] [[Niobe (schooner)|''Niobe'']] (1 July 1930&nbsp;– 9 October 1930), attaining the rank of ''[[Midshipman|Seekadett]]'' (midshipman) on 9 October 1930. Following a 14-month stay onboard the [[German cruiser Emden|cruiser ''Emden'']] (10 October 1930&nbsp;– 4 January 1932), he advanced in rank to ''[[Fähnrich zur See]]'' (officer cadet) on 1 January 1932.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=41}}{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=5–7}} The global cruise on ''Emden'' took Kretschmer to the [[Far East]] through the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Suez canal]]. The ship made stops in [[Ceylon]], the [[Philippines]], [[China]] and [[Japan]]. Stops were made in [[Guam]], [[South Africa]], [[Angola]] and [[Spain]] on the return journey.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=8}} The ''Emden'' returned to [[Wilhelmshaven]] on 2 December 1931. On 1 January 1932, Kretschmer and his crew mates were promoted to ''[[Fähnrich zur See]]'' ([[midshipman]]).{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=41}}

Following his journey on ''Emden'', Kretschmer attended a naval infantry course for cadets at Stralsund (5 January–31 March 1932),<ref group=Tr>infantry course for cadets—''Infanterielehrgang für Fähnriche''</ref> before starting with the main cadet course at the [[Naval Academy Mürwik]] on 1 April 1932.<ref group=Tr>main cadet course—''Hauptlehrgang für Fähnriche''</ref> This course was interrupted by two brief assignments on the [[survey vessel]] [[Meteor (1915)|''Meteor'']] (22–25 June 1932 and 10–15 October 1932) for navigation training. His training included a pathfinder course for cadets at Kiel (28 March −22 April 1933),<ref group=Tr>pathfinder course for cadets—''Sperrlehrgang für Fähnriche''</ref> an artillery course for cadets at Kiel-Wik (23 April – 28 June 1933),<ref group=Tr>artillery course for cadets—''Artillerielehrgang für Fähnriche''</ref> a torpedo course in [[Mürwik]] (29 June – 18 August 1933),<ref group=Tr>torpedo course for cadets—''Torpedolehrgang für Fähnriche''</ref> an anti-aircraft artillery course at Wilhelmshaven (19–31 August 1933),<ref group=Tr>anti-aircraft artillery course for cadets—''Fla-Waffenlehrgang für Fähnriche''</ref> a communication course for cadets at Mürwik again (1–3 September 1933),<ref group=Tr>communication course for cadets—''Nachrichtenlehrgang für Fähnriche''</ref> and his first U-boat course at Mürwik (25 September – 1 October 1933).{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=41}}

On 2 October 1933, Kretschmer then transferred to the pocket battleship [[German cruiser Deutschland|''Deutschland'']] as a gunnery officer during a trip to [[Denmark]]. This stay was interrupted for an aerial defense training course at Warnemünde (5–10 March 1934).<ref group=Tr>aerial defense training course for cadets—''Luftschutzlehrgang für Fähnriche''</ref> On 19 March 1934, his stay on ''Deutschland'' ended and he was transferred to the light cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Köln||2}} (20 March – 26 September 1934).{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=41}} Kretschmer was present for gunnery exercises in the [[North Sea|North]] and [[Baltic Sea]]. At [[Eckernförde]] on the 25/26 July 1934 Hitler boarded the ship to observe the exercise.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=8–9}} During this assignment, Kretschmer was promoted to ''Oberfähnrich zur See'' (Senior Ensign) on 1 April 1934.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=41}} During another torpedo training course at Flensburg-Mürwik (27 September – 21 December 1934), Kretschmer received his commission as ''[[Leutnant zur See]]'' on 1 October 1934.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|pp=41–42}} On 22 December 1934, Kretschmer was again on ''Köln'' serving as the ship's second torpedo officer.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=42}}

===''Kriegsmarine''===
In 1933 [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] came to power. The establishment of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (Nazi German Armed Forces) in 1935 divided the major branches of the armed forces. The ''Reichsmarine'' was renamed the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'', a Nazi creation. The [[OKM]] was established as the supreme command of the navy responsible for all facets of [[naval warfare]]. The renaming of the navy was a symbolic gesture, to erase the unpleasant memories of the 1920s and symbolise a new era.{{sfn|Thomas|1990|p=110}} According to one historian, Kretschmer was a patriot and loyal to the government, but later \"eschewed Nazi efforts to glorify his success through [[Nazi propaganda|propaganda]].\"{{sfn|Zabecki|1999|p=380}}

During Kretschmer's stay on ''Köln'', he attended an [[aircraft catapult]] course at [[Travemünde]].<ref group=Tr>aircraft catapult course —''Katapultlehrgang''</ref> On 26 September 1935, he was transferred to the 1st department of the standing ship division of the North Sea in Wilhelmshaven where he served as a company officer until 25 January 1936.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=42}} Kretschmer joined the U-boat service in January 1936. After the completion of his submariner training he was promoted to ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' (sub-lieutenant){{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=9}} on 1 June 1936.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=42}}  Kretschmer's first operational experience on a submarine was as a lieutenant on the {{GS|U-35|1936|2}} in 1937 as first watch officer under the command of [[Klaus Ewerth]] and then [[Hans-Rudolf Rösing]]. Rösing brought his own watch officer, and Kretschmer was demoted to second watch officer. While discharging his responsibilities for the operational readiness of the deck gun, Rösing dived leaving Kretschmer stranded in the freezing water. He clung to the periscope in the hope of being seen through the optics. Kretschmer was soon missed and the boat surfaced to find him before he succumbed to the cold.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=11–12}}

He was given interim command of ''U-35'' in August 1937, and this appointment coincided with [[German involvement in the Spanish Civil War|Germany's involvement]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The boat was ordered to patrol the [[Bay of Biscay]] off the Spanish-French border. The crew were permitted ashore at the resort town of [[San Sebastian]]. Rösing's successor, Hermann Michahelles was killed in a car accident and Kretschmer assumed command for two weeks.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=14–15}} ''U-35'' returned to Germany after an uneventful patrol during which no ships were sunk. On 1 October 1937, Kretschmer took command of {{GS|U-23|1936|2}}.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=14}} Through the remaining [[Interwar period]], Kretschmer developed his own approach to combat. He dispensed with the standard practice of firing salvos, instead he practiced a \"one torpedo one ship\" policy as a means to achieving utmost efficiency with munitions. Kretschmer favoured surfaced attacks as opposed to the recommended submerged engagement.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=15–19}} Kretschmer was promoted to ''[[Kapitänleutnant]]'' ([[captain lieutenant]]) on 1 June 1939.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=42}}

==World War II==
===''U-23'': Patrols 1–8===
The [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]] on 1 September 1939 began the war in Europe. [[Karl Dönitz]],  [[Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote]] (BdU), ordered attacks on Allied shipping at sea, beginning the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. The short range of the [[Type II submarine]] allowed for operations in the North Sea, but no further.

[[File:U-9 IWM HU 1012.jpg|thumb|left|A [[German Type II submarine#Type IIB|Type IIB]] U-boat similar to ''U-23'']]
Kretschmer and ''U-23'' had departed from Wilhelmshaven on 25 August, one week before the start of World War II. His first patrol, with ''Oberleutnant zur See'' [[Adalbert Schnee]] as first watch officer, took ''U-23'' into the [[North Sea]] and along the coast of the Netherlands. The boat returned to Wilhelmshaven on 4 September.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=43}} Further patrols took ''U-23'' around the [[Coastline of the United Kingdom|British coast]]. The main area of operations were the seas and estuaries off  [[East of England]] and [[Scotland]], with mine-laying operations in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], to counter the [[Royal Navy Submarine Service]] at the end of 1939.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=37}} A second patrol (9–21 September) yielded no success either.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=254}} Kretschmer departed Kiel for the third war patrol on 1 October. On 4 October 1939 he sank the coastal ship [[List of shipwrecks in October 1939#4 October|''Glen Farg'']] ({{GRT|876|link=off}}). The small freighter was carrying pulp and [[Ferrochrome]]. Kretschmer waited for the crew to take to the lifeboats before destroying the ship with a torpedo.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=107}} He returned to Kiel, rather than Wilhelmshaven, on 16 October. The next day, Kretschmer was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class ({{lang|de|Eisernes Kreuz zweiter Klasse}}).{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=406}}

The fourth patrol (1–9 November) was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=254}} On his fifth patrol (5–15 December) he was ordered to explore the inner waters around the [[Orkneys]] and engage any remaining [[Home Fleet]] units that had departed [[Scapa Flow]] in the aftermath of [[Günther Prien]]'s attack.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=37, 254}} Kretschmer targeted the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[List of shipwrecks in December 1939#8 December|''Scotia'']], a {{GRT|2,400|link=off}} on 7 December. The ship was accompanied by three other vessels, but she was darkened and the black out aroused Kretschmer's suspicions. 19 men were killed in the sinking; only two were saved.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|pp=180–181}} Following this patrol, he received the Iron Cross 1st Class ({{lang|de|Eisernes Kreuz erster Klasse}}) on 17 December.{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=406}}

''U-23'' departed from Kiel on 8 January 1940 for its sixth war patrol and Schnee had been replaced by ''Oberleutnant zur See'' [[Hans-Dietrich von Tiesenhausen]].{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=44}} The [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[List of shipwrecks in January 1940#11 January|''Fredville'']], only {{GRT|1,150|link=off}} was sunk on 11 January 1940 without warning. The single torpedo attack killed 11 men. Only five sailors survived.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=450}} Kretschmer's next success came in the Inganess Bay, [[Kirkwall]], where he attacked and sank the Danish {{GRT|10,517|link=off}} tanker [[List of shipwrecks in January 1940#12 January|''Danmark'']] on 12 January 1940{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=9}} while she lay at anchor. There were no deaths among the crew. {{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=451}} Kretschmer returned to Wilhelmshaven on 15 January. Three days later he departed for his seventh war patrol.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=254}} Another neutral Scandinvian ship was sunk. The Norwegian [[List of shipwrecks in January 1940#24 January|''Varild'']] {{GRT|1,085|link=off}} sank east of the [[Shetland]]. The attack was conducted with no prior warning and consequently all 15 crewmen died.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=453}} ''U-23'' returned to port on 29 January. He departed Wilhelmshaven for his eighth war patrol on 9 February.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=254}}

On 18 February, Kretschmer sank the 1,300 ton [[United Kingdom|British]] [[destroyer|fleet destroyer]] {{HMS|Daring|H16|2}} off the [[Pentland Firth]] while she was escorting convoy HN&nbsp;12 from [[Norway]]. {{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=14}}  The destroyer crew lifted the black-out curtains making the attack easy. A single torpedo was fired, then Kretschmer ordered a u-turn and sped away on the surface; the destroyers neither sighted him nor detected him with [[ASDIC]]. {{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=106}} Kretschmer sighted the British submarine, [[HMS Thistle (N24)|''Thistle'']] soon afterwards, and fired a second torpedo which missed.  The submarine was sunk weeks later by ''U-4''.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=106}} 157 of the ''Daring'' crew were killed, including Commander Sydney Cooper. Only five survived.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=107}} The next day, {{SS|Tiberton||2}}, {{GRT|5,225|link=off}} sank in the [[Moray Firth]]. All 33 men aboard died.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=459}} [[List of shipwrecks in February 1940#22 February|''Loch Maddy'']]
, {{GRT|4,996|link=off}}, was sunk on 22 February. The ship had been torpedoed by ''U-57'' and abandoned.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=459}} Kretschmer returned to Wilhelmshaven on 25 February after 17 days at sea—his longest to date.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=254}}

===''U-99'': Battle of the Atlantic===

On 2 April 1940, after eight patrols on ''U-23'', Kretschmer was ordered to the [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]], the shipbuilding works in Kiel, for construction training of the new [[German Type VII submarine|Type VIIB]] {{GS|U-99|1940|2}}. He commissioned ''U-99'' on 18 April 1940 which was part of the [[7th U-boat Flotilla]].{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=42}}{{sfn|Wiggins|1999|p=30}} After two months' training and shakedown manoeuvres in German waters, Kretschmer took the boat into action on 18 June 1940.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=45}} On 21 June, his ninth patrol, his boat was damaged by an [[Arado Ar 196]] floatplane from {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} in the belief ''U-99'' was a British submarine.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=73}} ''U-99''{{'}}s first patrol ended in Wilhelmshaven on 25 June.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=45}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MW-0952-17, Frankreich, Auszeichnungen für U-99-Besatzung.jpg|thumb|''[[Kapitänleutnant]]'' Kretschmer receiving his Knight's Cross from the hands of ''[[Großadmiral]]'' [[Erich Raeder]], August 1940]]
During ''U-99''{{'}}s first four patrols, Kretschmer commenced attacking convoys at night on the surface, sinking merchant ships with highly accurate shots, using only one [[torpedo]] per target ship; the quote \"one torpedo ... one ship\" is attributed to Kretschmer around this time. His particularly brazen and risky innovation was to execute these night surface attacks inside the convoy. Admiral [[Sir George Creasy]] considered the manoeuvre so dangerous he thought it had been done by mistake.{{sfn|Wiggins|1999|p=31}} Kretschmer's tenth patrol (27 June–21 July) yielded over {{GRT|20,000|link=off}}.{{sfn|Paterson|2018||p=256}} After sinking ''[[List of shipwrecks in July 1940#5 July|Magog]]''—the submarine's first victim—Kretschmer gave the crew a bottle of brandy and directions to Ireland.{{sfn|Paterson|2018||p=80}} Acts of compassion in submarine warfare were \"selective and fickle\" one historian wrote when describing Kretschmer's rescue of a lone man in a raft. Haunted by him, Kretschmer ordered the boat to backtrack until the survivor was found. They provided clothes and alcohol, then transferred him to a lifeboat at the first opportunity.{{sfn|Sturma|2011|p=80}}

Among the victims was the [[Estonia]]n ship, ''Merisaar'', {{GRT|2,126|link=off}}. Kretschmer captured the vessel, the only such ship seized by ''U-99''. The crew abandoned ship and were questioned by Kretschmer. The German crew failed to sink the stationary vessel with torpedoes while the weather ruled out the use of the gun. A prize crew boarded to sail it to [[Bordeaux]]. The ship did not reach port. German aircraft bombed and sank it three days later. Kretschmer docked in [[Lorient]] on 21 July.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=87, 256}} The BdU acquired new bases along the French Atlantic coast after the [[Battle of France]].{{sfn|Terraine|1989|p=770}} A notable failure on the patrol occurred in the interception of [[SS Manistee (1920)|HMS ''Manistee'']]. Kretschmer attempted to sink the ship with gunfire, but return fire and the appearance of an aircraft forced him to submerge. Under water ''U-99'' had  no chance of catching her.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=81}}

Four days later Kretschmer began his eleventh patrol which concluded on 5 August. This third patrol on ''U-99'', took the boat into the North Atlantic, into the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]] and west of Ireland. He sank four ships and damaged three.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=45}} His greatest success was the sinking of ''[[List of shipwrecks in July 1940#28 July|Auckland Star]]'', a {{GRT|13,212|link=off}} ship on 28 July followed by another two totalling {{GRT|12,811|link=off}} on 29 and 31 July. Kretschmer was guided onto convoy OB-191. The 28-ship convoy was poorly defended by a destroyer and a [[corvette]]. Kretschmer was presented with an opportunity to put his one torpedo, one ship into practice.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=98–101}} Kretschmer hit and sank ''[[List of shipwrecks in July 1940#31 July|Jersey City]]'', {{convert|70|nmi|km mi|abbr=off}} northwest of [[Tory Island]]{{sfn|Tennent|2001|p=264}} while damaging three others including the {{GRT|10,973|lnk=off}} ''[[List of shipwrecks in August 1940#2 August|Strinda]]''. The ships used barrels for ballast to prevent them sinking. The crew remained in lifeboats nearby for reboarding once the attack was over.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=98–101}} Following his third war patrol with ''U-99'', Kretschmer was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{Lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}) on 4 August. The presentation was made by Dönitz following his return to Lorient.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|pp=42, 45}}

On ''U-99''{{'}}s fourth war patrol from 4 to 35 September 1940,{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=45}} Kretschmer formed part of a [[wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]] that struck against [[Convoy HX 72]]. The convoy suffered heavy losses while the U-boats escaped unscathed. Kretschmer sank one and damaged two–which he and Prien dispatched the following day.  [[Joachim Schepke]] arrived in ''U-100'' and sank seven. [[Heinrich Bleichrodt]] hit and sank two. 12 ships were sunk in total.{{sfn|Milner|2011||pp=40–41}} Kretschmer's logbook recorded the chaos. It noted the destroyers \"did not know how to help\" and busied themselves firing star shells on a moonlit night.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=41}} The following month, Kretschmer formed part of the pack that attacked and devastated [[Convoy SC 7]]. Bleichrodt reported it and Dönitz succeeded in bringing multiple boats in on it. Kretschmer sank six and disabled a seventh.{{sfn|Milner|2011|pp=40–4}} Kretschmer recommended his [[helmsman]] ''[[Stabsfeldwebel|Stabsobersteuermann]]'' [[Heinrich Petersen (naval officer)|Heinrich Petersen]] for the Knight's Cross after twelve war patrols for saving ''U-99'' from enemy detection. The nomination was approved on 5 November 1940. Petersen had served as Kretschmer's helmsman on every war patrol on both ''U-23'' and ''U-99''.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=97}}

In November and December 1940 ''U-99'' sank three British [[Armed Merchant Cruiser|armed merchant cruisers]] (AMC), [[SS Laurentic (1927)|HMS ''Laurentic'']], [[SS Patroclus (1923)|HMS ''Patroclus'']] and {{HMS|Forfar|F30|6}}. ''Laurentic'' and ''Patroclus'' were attacked on the night of 3/4 November.{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|pp=35, 37}} 51 men died aboard ''Laurentic'', 367 survived. ''Patroclus'' lost 56 crew; 230 survived.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=68}} Kretschmer was awarded the 6th [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] ({{lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub}}) on 4 November 1940.{{sfn|Scherzer|2007|p=474}} ''U-99'' docked four days later, concluding Kretschmer's fourteenth patrol after just ten days at sea.{{sfn|Paterson|2018||p=255}} Upon reaching port, he was summoned to Berlin to meet [[Erich Raeder]]. He was given the opportunity to convey his opinions on the state of the U-boat war. Kretschmer purportedly confined his remarks to the lack of air support from the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', a point Raeder was fully aware. Kretschmer then met Hitler at the [[Reich Chancellery]] and he repeated his opinions on the war situation. Hitler invited Kretschmer to sit in on a lunch meeting with Hitler and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], the [[Soviet Union]]'s ambassador to the Third Reich. Kretschmer's thoughts on Hitler and the subsequent conference are not known.{{sfn|Paterson|2018||pp=161–162}}

Kretschmer departed for his fifteenth patrol on 27 November and returned on 12 December.{{sfn|Paterson|2018||p=255}} In December Kretschmer tried to intercept [[Convoy HX 90]] but encountered only stragglers.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=46}} ''Forfar'' was one and during the sinking, ''HMS Viscount'' appeared forcing Kretschmer to dive. He assumed most of the crew went down with the ship; but there were 159 survivors. 176 men died.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|pp=74, 76–77}} ''Laurentic'' and ''Patroclus'' had been loaded with wooden barrels to increase [[buoyancy]]. It took nine torpedoes and one dud to sink them; the latter was sunk after it stopped to pick up survivors from the former.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=72}} Kretschmer was forced to engage ''Patroclus'' with the deck gun when it appeared to resist the torpedo damage but retreated when the ship fired back. A [[Short Sunderland]] appeared briefly, and Kretschmer was forced to accomplish the destruction of the ship with torpedoes, submerged.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=72}} On 7 December 1940, Kretschmer sank the Dutch freighter ''[[List of shipwrecks in December 1940#7 December|Farmsum]]''; the last success of the year. The ship was loaded with coal, set for [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. The ship sank slowly. Kretschmer learned its identity from frantic radio signals.{{sfn|Paterson|2018||pp=172–173}}

===Defeat and capture===
Several of Kretschmer's senior officers departed the boat before the final patrol. [[Klaus Bargsten]] served aboard ''U-99'' under Kretschmer, before being promoted to captain himself and becoming the sole survivor of {{GS|U-521||2}} on 2 June 1942.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=67–70, 247}}

On 22 February 1941 ''U-99'' left Lorient for the final time. For 13 days Kretschmer sailed without success. ''U-99'' tried in vain to assist Prien in ''U-47'', against OB&nbsp;290. Prien achieved several sinkings, Kretschmer did not; the pair was chased off by destroyers. Prien's reports were picked up by the Luftwaffe which sent [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]]s from I. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–45)#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' of [[Kampfgeschwader 40|''Kampfgeschwader'' 40]] (KG&nbsp;40—40th Bomber Wing) to attack the convoy. The air crews sank eight and damaged several more. Kretschmer continued to search for stragglers and found ''SS Holmlea''. He fired a single torpedo that missed before he lost the ship in thick mist. Prien sank the ship the following day. Prien and Kretschmer cooperated frequently during the course of this patrol - neither would complete it.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=184–186}}

The operation against [[Convoy OB 293]] proved disastrous for the Lorient group. Prien, Kretschmer along with {{GS|U-70|1940|2}} (Matz) and {{GS|UA|1939|2}} attacked the convoy. The ships were protected by an escort group of two [[destroyer]]s, {{HMS|Wolverine|D78|2}} and {{HMS|Verity|D63|2}}, and two [[corvette]]s, {{HMS|Arbutus|K86|2}} and {{HMS|Camellia|K31|2}}.{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|2005|p=62}} As with the group that would eventually sink Kretschmer ten days later, they were experienced and competent.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=52}} Kretschmer attempted a surface night attack using his favourite tactic.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=187–190}} On 7 March Kretschmer sank two ships from the convoy including the {{GRT|20,638|link=off}} ''[[list of shipwrecks in March 1941#7 March|Terje Viken]]''.{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=45}} Four ships were sunk, but two U-boats were sunk, one of them ''U-47''. Prien along with his crew disappeared, presumably in a depth charge attack.{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|2005|pp=62–63}} British reports of the action mention a large red glow appearing deep below the surface amid the depth charge explosions.{{sfn|Terraine|1989|p=314}}

On 16 March 1941 Kretschmer attacked [[Convoy HX 112]]. Kretschmer sank all but one of the ships lost by the convoy.{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=46}} During a counterattack by the escorts ''U-99'' was disabled after repeated [[depth charge]] attacks by the destroyers {{HMS|Walker|D27|2}} and {{HMS|Vanoc|H33|2}}.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=77}} ''U-99'' was driven down to 700 feet—beyond the recognised [[crush depth]]— before control was regained and the ballast tanks blown.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=53}} Kretschmer surfaced and, under fire from the British vessels, scuttled his boat. Three of his men were lost, but Kretschmer and the remainder of ''U-99''{{'}}s crew were captured. That same day the British escorts scored another success against the ''Kriegsmarine'' when the noted U-Boat skipper, [[Joachim Schepke]], was killed aboard {{GS|U-100|1940|2}}, having been depth charged, rammed and sunk by ''Vanoc''.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=77}}

Kretschmer's usual standards of conduct were evident during the sinking of his boat. One signalman sent a message to the escorts \"we are sinking\" and the firing stopped.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=53}} He then sent a message to BdU, \"Two destroyers—depth charges—50,000 tons—Kretschmer.\"{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=53}} Kretschmer signalled ''Walker'' asking for rescue for his men, taking care to ensure as many left the submarine as possible, and assisted some of his crew towards the rescue nets hung from the British destroyer. Kretschmer's strength was evidently failing in the cold ocean; his own rescue was at the hands of a British sailor who climbed down the nets and plucked him from the water.{{sfn|Padfield|1995|p=115}}

===Prisoner of war===
Kretschmer and his crew were landed in [[Liverpool]]. They were sent to [[Lime Street Station]] to be transported to London for interrogation. Kretschmer was taken separately but his crew had to negotiate the streets of Liverpool and were subjected to missiles thrown by angry civilians; the city [[Liverpool Blitz|had been heavily bombed]] and was closely linked with the Atlantic war. He was transported to the [[London Cage]], a facility for [[MI19]] to hold valuable enemy prisoners. The building was located at number 8 [[Kensington Palace Gardens]].{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=230–232}} [[Winston Churchill]] disclosed the capture of Kretschmer to the [[House of Commons]] on 21 March. German radio acknowledged the capture and the death of Schepke. Prien's demise was not disclosed. German propagandists feared the triple loss might be too damaging to morale.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=222}}

Once in London, Royal Navy interrogators questioned the crew. The report, filed in the archives, was named [http://www.uboatarchive.net/U-99A/U-99INT.htm \"U 99\" Interrogation of Survivors April, 1941\"]. The British reported noted of Kretschmer, \"His political views were less extremely Nazi than had been assumed.  On seeing the craters of a stick of bombs near [[Buckingham Palace]] he was genuinely shocked that an attempt had so obviously been made by his countrymen to bomb the Palace. He spoke English quite well, though he lacked practice.  His whole demeanour was calm and quiet, and he seemed anxious to be friendly; he was also less suspicious of British Officers than was his First Lieutenant. Kretschmer stated that he was unmarried.\"<ref>[http://www.uboatarchive.net/U-99A/U-99INT.htm \"Interrogation of U-99 survivors\"]</ref>

Of his personality and view of the war it stated, \"He gave the impression of being a quiet, deliberate man, and looked more like a student than a U-Boat Captain. He prided himself on being able to take advantage of whatever the passing moment offered and made no elaborate plans for attacking convoys. He admitted that he had become weary of the war some time ago, and latterly had got no satisfaction from sinking ship after ship.
\"<ref>[http://www.uboatarchive.net/U-99A/U-99INT.htm \"Interrogation of U-99 survivors\"]</ref>

Following his capture, Kretschmer spent almost seven years as a [[prisoner of war]] (POW) in the hands of the British at No1 POW camp [[Grizedale Hall]]  in [[Cumbria]].{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=202}} In March 1942, the prisoners were transported to Bowmanville Camp near [[Lake Ontario]] in [[Canada]].{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=230}} During his captivity, Kretschmer was promoted in rank to ''[[Korvettenkapitän]]'' (corvette captain) on 19 March 1941, effective as of 1 March 1941, and to ''[[Fregattenkapitän]]'' (frigate captain) on 1 September 1944. In addition, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] ({{lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern}}) on 26 December 1941. He was the fifth member of the German armed forces to be so honored.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=42}}

On 27 August 1941, [[HMS Graph|''U-570'']] was captured by the Royal Navy. The officers were also taken to the prisoner-of-war camp at Grizedale Hall.{{sfn|Blair|1998|p=347}} Kretschmer was senior officer at the camp. An illegal \"[[Court of Honor|Court of Honour]]\" was convened and headed by Kretschmer. They tried commander Hans-Joachim Rahmlow, ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'', and ''U-570''{{'}}s other officers. Rahmlow and his second-in-command, Bernhard Berndt, were found \"guilty of cowardice\"; the other two officers were \"acquitted\". On the night of 18/19 October, Berndt escaped from the camp. A detachment of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] apprehended him, shooting him when he tried to escape. Allied courts and Rahmlow sought justice against Kretschmer after the war, but he was never vigorously pursued for trial for his role in the death of Berndt.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=222–228, 238, 240}} Kretschmer was involved in a second illegal court of honour hearing against the commander of {{GS|U-501||2}}. Its commander, Hugo Förster, was repatriated to Germany and committed suicide before the end of the war.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=228–234}}

In 1943, the German command tried to rescue him (in [[Operation Kiebitz|Operation ''Kiebitz'']]) but that daring plan failed. Four of those years were spent in Canada at [[Bowmanville POW camp]]. Kretschmer was released from captivity on 31 December 1947 and returned to [[Germany]].{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=43}}

==Postwar career, later life==
In 1955, Sir [[Donald Macintyre (Royal Navy officer)|Donald McIntyre]] returned Kretschmer's [[binoculars]], which he had kept in 1941. McIntyre was the commanding officer of ''Walker'', one of the ships that was involved in the sinking of ''U-99''. At the time, Kretschmer was president of the [[:de:Deutscher Marinebund|''Deutscher Marinebund'']], a member club of the [[International Maritime Confederation]].{{sfn|Der Spiegel Volume 46/1955}}

[[File:Marinebundestreffen 1966 (Kiel 38.426).jpg|thumb|[[Flotilla admiral|''Flotillenadmiral'']] Kretschmer in 1966]]
On 1 December 1955, Kretschmer joined [[West Germany]]'s navy, at the time named the ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' (Federal Navy), holding the rank of ''Fregattenkapitän''. He participated in the 2nd officers training course held at the former [[NS-Ordensburgen|NS-''Ordensburg'']] [[Ordensburg Sonthofen|Sonthofen]].{{refn|The ''Ordensburg'' Sonthofen was later renamed ''Generaloberst-Beck-Kaserne''.|group=\"Note\"}} There, he became inspection group leader at the acceptance organization.<ref group=Tr>inspection group leader at the acceptance organization—''Prüfgruppenleiter bei der Annahmeorganisation''</ref> On 16 June 1956, he was tasked with the creation of [[:de:Schulgeschwader (Bundesmarine)|1. ''Geleitgeschwader'']] (1st Escort Squadron) which he commanded from 3 January to 15 October 1957. He then attended a training course (16 October 1957 – 28 February 1958) for [[amphibious forces]] in the United States.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=43}}

From 1 March to 31 October 1958, Kretschmer served as ''Admiralstabsoffizier'' (Asto—officer of the admiralty staff) with the [[:de:Flottenkommando|Fleet Command]]. On 1 November 1958, he was transferred to the position of commander of the ''Bundesmarine''{{'}}s [[:de:Amphibische Gruppe|''Amphibische Streitkräfte'']] (\"amphibious forces\"), a position he held until 15 January 1962. During this command, he was promoted to ''[[Kapitän zur See]]'' (captain at sea/captain) on 12 December 1958.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=43}} On 16 January 1962, Kretschmer was appointed head of the department for naval task force training and naval tactics with the [[Armed Forces Staff (Germany)|''Führungsstab der Marine'']] (Navy Staff) with the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Defence]].<ref group=Tr>head of the department for naval task force training and naval tactics—''Leiter des Referates Verbandsausbildung und Seetaktik''</ref> On 28 August 1963, he was transferred to the [[NATO Defense College]] in Paris.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=43}} Kretschmer served in this function until 18 June 1964 when he was appointed chief-of-staff of the [[Allied Forces Baltic Approaches|''Befehlshaber der Seestreitkräfte der Nordsee'']] (German national Commander Naval Forces North Sea). On 1 June 1965, he was promoted to ''[[Flottillenadmiral]]'' (flotilla admiral), a rank which he initially held on probation. That day, he was made chief-of-staff of the NATO command [[Allied Forces Baltic Approaches|COMNAVBALTAP]] at [[Kiel]], taking command on 15 June. Six months later, on 15 December, he officially became ''Flottillenadmiral''. His command ended on 31 March 1969. The next day, Kretschmer was transferred to the [[:de:Amt für Militärkunde|''Amt für Militärkunde'']] (Department of Military Studies), retiring on 30 September 1970.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=43}}

In later years Kretschmer was often interviewed for television and radio programmes about the Second World War; he appeared in the British 1974 documentary series ''[[The World at War]]''. In the mid-1990s he was interviewed for the computer simulation game ''[[Aces of the Deep (video game)|Aces of the Deep]]'', as one of several former U-boat skippers whose input was excerpted specially for the CD-Rom version of the game.

===Death===
While on holiday in [[Bavaria]] in the summer of 1998, Kretschmer died in an accident during a boating expedition on the [[Danube]] to celebrate his 50th wedding anniversary, at the age of 86. He was on a holiday cruise from [[Regensburg]] to [[Budapest]] when he tried climbing some almost vertical steps. A fall caused fatal injuries. His body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.

'''Otto Kretschmer''' (1 May 1912 – 5 August 1998) was a German naval officer and [[submarine]]r in [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]].

From September 1939 until his surrender in March 1941, he sank 47 ships, a total of 274,333 tons. For this he received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]], among other awards. He earned the nickname \"Silent Otto\" both for his successful use of the \"[[Silent running (submarine)|silent running]]\" capability of U-boats as well as for his reluctance to transmit radio messages during patrols. After the war, he served in the German Federal Navy and retired in 1970 with the rank of ''Flottillenadmiral'' (flotilla admiral).

==Early life and career==
Kretschmer was born in [[Hajduki Nyskie|Heidau]] near [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]], then in the [[German Empire]] on 1 May 1912 to Friedrich Wilhelm Otto and Alice new Herbig.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=1}} His father was a teacher at the local ''Volkschule'' ([[primary school]]) where Otto attended from 1918–1921. He then moved to a ''Realgymnasium'' ([[secondary school]]).{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=1}} In the aftermath of [[World War I]] the Kretschmer family remained aloof from the political turbulence of the [[Weimar era]]. Kretschmer indulged in sporting pastimes and scientific interests. Kretschmer achieved good results in mathematics and chemistry and passed his ''[[Abitur]]'' (school-leaving certificate) at 17. The report contained the remark, \"Kretschmer demonstrated his extraordinary courage in many instances. He wants to be a naval officer.\"{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=2}} Kretschmer was too young to enlist at 17 and his father sent him to [[England]] to broaden his horizons. He enrolled at [[Exeter University]] (then University College of the South West of England) and studied under Professor Jacob Wilhelm Schopp (b. 1871), a German–born naturalised Briton. He mastered the [[English language]] and came to respect British education, its practical focus complemented his scientific and theoretical–based German background. His time in England shaped his view of them during the war; he was quick to believe in rumours of new British inventions during the war at sea.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=2–4}} He returned home upon his mother's death from tetanus in a medical malpractice incident. He did not return to England from his hiatus, but travelled through [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Italy]].{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=2–4}}

===''Reichsmarine''===

Kretschmer entered the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' (Weimar Navy) on 1 April 1930 as ''See Offizier Anwärter'' (naval officer cadet). Kretschmer formed part of \"Crew 30\" (the incoming class of 1930), 78–strong intake of officer candidates.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=3}} He underwent basic military training in the 2nd department of the standing ship division of the [[Baltic Sea]] in [[Stralsund]] (1 April 1930&nbsp;– 30 June 1930).<ref group=Tr>2nd department —II. ''Abteilung''</ref><ref group=Tr>standing ship division —''Schiffsstammdivision''</ref> Kretschmer was then transferred to the [[training ship]] [[Niobe (schooner)|''Niobe'']] (1 July 1930&nbsp;– 9 October 1930), attaining the rank of ''[[Midshipman|Seekadett]]'' (midshipman) on 9 October 1930. Following a 14-month stay onboard the [[German cruiser Emden|cruiser ''Emden'']] (10 October 1930&nbsp;– 4 January 1932), he advanced in rank to ''[[Fähnrich zur See]]'' (officer cadet) on 1 January 1932.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=41}}{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=5–7}} The global cruise on ''Emden'' took Kretschmer to the [[Far East]] through the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Suez canal]]. The ship made stops in [[Ceylon]], the [[Philippines]], [[China]] and [[Japan]]. Stops were made in [[Guam]], [[South Africa]], [[Angola]] and [[Spain]] on the return journey.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=8}} The ''Emden'' returned to [[Wilhelmshaven]] on 2 December 1931. On 1 January 1932, Kretschmer and his crew mates were promoted to ''[[Fähnrich zur See]]'' ([[midshipman]]).{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=41}}

Following his journey on ''Emden'', Kretschmer attended a naval infantry course for cadets at Stralsund (5 January–31 March 1932),<ref group=Tr>infantry course for cadets—''Infanterielehrgang für Fähnriche''</ref> before starting with the main cadet course at the [[Naval Academy Mürwik]] on 1 April 1932.<ref group=Tr>main cadet course—''Hauptlehrgang für Fähnriche''</ref> This course was interrupted by two brief assignments on the [[survey vessel]] [[Meteor (1915)|''Meteor'']] (22–25 June 1932 and 10–15 October 1932) for navigation training. His training included a pathfinder course for cadets at Kiel (28 March −22 April 1933),<ref group=Tr>pathfinder course for cadets—''Sperrlehrgang für Fähnriche''</ref> an artillery course for cadets at Kiel-Wik (23 April – 28 June 1933),<ref group=Tr>artillery course for cadets—''Artillerielehrgang für Fähnriche''</ref> a torpedo course in [[Mürwik]] (29 June – 18 August 1933),<ref group=Tr>torpedo course for cadets—''Torpedolehrgang für Fähnriche''</ref> an anti-aircraft artillery course at Wilhelmshaven (19–31 August 1933),<ref group=Tr>anti-aircraft artillery course for cadets—''Fla-Waffenlehrgang für Fähnriche''</ref> a communication course for cadets at Mürwik again (1–3 September 1933),<ref group=Tr>communication course for cadets—''Nachrichtenlehrgang für Fähnriche''</ref> and his first U-boat course at Mürwik (25 September – 1 October 1933).{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=41}}

On 2 October 1933, Kretschmer then transferred to the pocket battleship [[German cruiser Deutschland|''Deutschland'']] as a gunnery officer during a trip to [[Denmark]]. This stay was interrupted for an aerial defense training course at Warnemünde (5–10 March 1934).<ref group=Tr>aerial defense training course for cadets—''Luftschutzlehrgang für Fähnriche''</ref> On 19 March 1934, his stay on ''Deutschland'' ended and he was transferred to the light cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Köln||2}} (20 March – 26 September 1934).{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=41}} Kretschmer was present for gunnery exercises in the [[North Sea|North]] and [[Baltic Sea]]. At [[Eckernförde]] on the 25/26 July 1934 Hitler boarded the ship to observe the exercise.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=8–9}} During this assignment, Kretschmer was promoted to ''Oberfähnrich zur See'' (Senior Ensign) on 1 April 1934.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=41}} During another torpedo training course at Flensburg-Mürwik (27 September – 21 December 1934), Kretschmer received his commission as ''[[Leutnant zur See]]'' on 1 October 1934.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|pp=41–42}} On 22 December 1934, Kretschmer was again on ''Köln'' serving as the ship's second torpedo officer.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=42}}

===''Kriegsmarine''===
In 1933 [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] came to power. The establishment of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (Nazi German Armed Forces) in 1935 divided the major branches of the armed forces. The ''Reichsmarine'' was renamed the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'', a Nazi creation. The [[OKM]] was established as the supreme command of the navy responsible for all facets of [[naval warfare]]. The renaming of the navy was a symbolic gesture, to erase the unpleasant memories of the 1920s and symbolise a new era.{{sfn|Thomas|1990|p=110}} According to one historian, Kretschmer was a patriot and loyal to the government, but later \"eschewed Nazi efforts to glorify his success through [[Nazi propaganda|propaganda]].\"{{sfn|Zabecki|1999|p=380}}

During Kretschmer's stay on ''Köln'', he attended an [[aircraft catapult]] course at [[Travemünde]].<ref group=Tr>aircraft catapult course —''Katapultlehrgang''</ref> On 26 September 1935, he was transferred to the 1st department of the standing ship division of the North Sea in Wilhelmshaven where he served as a company officer until 25 January 1936.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=42}} Kretschmer joined the U-boat service in January 1936. After the completion of his submariner training he was promoted to ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' (sub-lieutenant){{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=9}} on 1 June 1936.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=42}}  Kretschmer's first operational experience on a submarine was as a lieutenant on the {{GS|U-35|1936|2}} in 1937 as first watch officer under the command of [[Klaus Ewerth]] and then [[Hans-Rudolf Rösing]]. Rösing brought his own watch officer, and Kretschmer was demoted to second watch officer. While discharging his responsibilities for the operational readiness of the deck gun, Rösing dived leaving Kretschmer stranded in the freezing water. He clung to the periscope in the hope of being seen through the optics. Kretschmer was soon missed and the boat surfaced to find him before he succumbed to the cold.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=11–12}}

He was given interim command of ''U-35'' in August 1937, and this appointment coincided with [[German involvement in the Spanish Civil War|Germany's involvement]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The boat was ordered to patrol the [[Bay of Biscay]] off the Spanish-French border. The crew were permitted ashore at the resort town of [[San Sebastian]]. Rösing's successor, Hermann Michahelles was killed in a car accident and Kretschmer assumed command for two weeks.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=14–15}} ''U-35'' returned to Germany after an uneventful patrol during which no ships were sunk. On 1 October 1937, Kretschmer took command of {{GS|U-23|1936|2}}.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=14}} Through the remaining [[Interwar period]], Kretschmer developed his own approach to combat. He dispensed with the standard practice of firing salvos, instead he practiced a \"one torpedo one ship\" policy as a means to achieving utmost efficiency with munitions. Kretschmer favoured surfaced attacks as opposed to the recommended submerged engagement.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=15–19}} Kretschmer was promoted to ''[[Kapitänleutnant]]'' ([[captain lieutenant]]) on 1 June 1939.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=42}}

==World War II==
===''U-23'': Patrols 1–8===
The [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]] on 1 September 1939 began the war in Europe. [[Karl Dönitz]],  [[Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote]] (BdU), ordered attacks on Allied shipping at sea, beginning the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. The short range of the [[Type II submarine]] allowed for operations in the North Sea, but no further.

[[File:U-9 IWM HU 1012.jpg|thumb|left|A [[German Type II submarine#Type IIB|Type IIB]] U-boat similar to ''U-23'']]
Kretschmer and ''U-23'' had departed from Wilhelmshaven on 25 August, one week before the start of World War II. His first patrol, with ''Oberleutnant zur See'' [[Adalbert Schnee]] as first watch officer, took ''U-23'' into the [[North Sea]] and along the coast of the Netherlands. The boat returned to Wilhelmshaven on 4 September.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=43}} Further patrols took ''U-23'' around the [[Coastline of the United Kingdom|British coast]]. The main area of operations were the seas and estuaries off  [[East of England]] and [[Scotland]], with mine-laying operations in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], to counter the [[Royal Navy Submarine Service]] at the end of 1939.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=37}} A second patrol (9–21 September) yielded no success either.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=254}} Kretschmer departed Kiel for the third war patrol on 1 October. On 4 October 1939 he sank the coastal ship [[List of shipwrecks in October 1939#4 October|''Glen Farg'']] ({{GRT|876|link=off}}). The small freighter was carrying pulp and [[Ferrochrome]]. Kretschmer waited for the crew to take to the lifeboats before destroying the ship with a torpedo.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=107}} He returned to Kiel, rather than Wilhelmshaven, on 16 October. The next day, Kretschmer was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class ({{lang|de|Eisernes Kreuz zweiter Klasse}}).{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=406}}

The fourth patrol (1–9 November) was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=254}} On his fifth patrol (5–15 December) he was ordered to explore the inner waters around the [[Orkneys]] and engage any remaining [[Home Fleet]] units that had departed [[Scapa Flow]] in the aftermath of [[Günther Prien]]'s attack.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=37, 254}} Kretschmer targeted the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[List of shipwrecks in December 1939#8 December|''Scotia'']], a {{GRT|2,400|link=off}} on 7 December. The ship was accompanied by three other vessels, but she was darkened and the black out aroused Kretschmer's suspicions. 19 men were killed in the sinking; only two were saved.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|pp=180–181}} Following this patrol, he received the Iron Cross 1st Class ({{lang|de|Eisernes Kreuz erster Klasse}}) on 17 December.{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=406}}

''U-23'' departed from Kiel on 8 January 1940 for its sixth war patrol and Schnee had been replaced by ''Oberleutnant zur See'' [[Hans-Dietrich von Tiesenhausen]].{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=44}} The [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[List of shipwrecks in January 1940#11 January|''Fredville'']], only {{GRT|1,150|link=off}} was sunk on 11 January 1940 without warning. The single torpedo attack killed 11 men. Only five sailors survived.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=450}} Kretschmer's next success came in the Inganess Bay, [[Kirkwall]], where he attacked and sank the Danish {{GRT|10,517|link=off}} tanker [[List of shipwrecks in January 1940#12 January|''Danmark'']] on 12 January 1940{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=9}} while she lay at anchor. There were no deaths among the crew. {{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=451}} Kretschmer returned to Wilhelmshaven on 15 January. Three days later he departed for his seventh war patrol.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=254}} Another neutral Scandinvian ship was sunk. The Norwegian [[List of shipwrecks in January 1940#24 January|''Varild'']] {{GRT|1,085|link=off}} sank east of the [[Shetland]]. The attack was conducted with no prior warning and consequently all 15 crewmen died.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=453}} ''U-23'' returned to port on 29 January. He departed Wilhelmshaven for his eighth war patrol on 9 February.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=254}}

On 18 February, Kretschmer sank the 1,300 ton [[United Kingdom|British]] [[destroyer|fleet destroyer]] {{HMS|Daring|H16|2}} off the [[Pentland Firth]] while she was escorting convoy HN&nbsp;12 from [[Norway]]. {{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=14}}  The destroyer crew lifted the black-out curtains making the attack easy. A single torpedo was fired, then Kretschmer ordered a u-turn and sped away on the surface; the destroyers neither sighted him nor detected him with [[ASDIC]]. {{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=106}} Kretschmer sighted the British submarine, [[HMS Thistle (N24)|''Thistle'']] soon afterwards, and fired a second torpedo which missed.  The submarine was sunk weeks later by ''U-4''.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=106}} 157 of the ''Daring'' crew were killed, including Commander Sydney Cooper. Only five survived.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=107}} The next day, {{SS|Tiberton||2}}, {{GRT|5,225|link=off}} sank in the [[Moray Firth]]. All 33 men aboard died.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=459}} [[List of shipwrecks in February 1940#22 February|''Loch Maddy'']]
, {{GRT|4,996|link=off}}, was sunk on 22 February. The ship had been torpedoed by ''U-57'' and abandoned.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=459}} Kretschmer returned to Wilhelmshaven on 25 February after 17 days at sea—his longest to date.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=254}}

===''U-99'': Battle of the Atlantic===

On 2 April 1940, after eight patrols on ''U-23'', Kretschmer was ordered to the [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]], the shipbuilding works in Kiel, for construction training of the new [[German Type VII submarine|Type VIIB]] {{GS|U-99|1940|2}}. He commissioned ''U-99'' on 18 April 1940 which was part of the [[7th U-boat Flotilla]].{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=42}}{{sfn|Wiggins|1999|p=30}} After two months' training and shakedown manoeuvres in German waters, Kretschmer took the boat into action on 18 June 1940.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=45}} On 21 June, his ninth patrol, his boat was damaged by an [[Arado Ar 196]] floatplane from {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} in the belief ''U-99'' was a British submarine.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=73}} ''U-99''{{'}}s first patrol ended in Wilhelmshaven on 25 June.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=45}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MW-0952-17, Frankreich, Auszeichnungen für U-99-Besatzung.jpg|thumb|''[[Kapitänleutnant]]'' Kretschmer receiving his Knight's Cross from the hands of ''[[Großadmiral]]'' [[Erich Raeder]], August 1940]]
During ''U-99''{{'}}s first four patrols, Kretschmer commenced attacking convoys at night on the surface, sinking merchant ships with highly accurate shots, using only one [[torpedo]] per target ship; the quote \"one torpedo ... one ship\" is attributed to Kretschmer around this time. His particularly brazen and risky innovation was to execute these night surface attacks inside the convoy. Admiral [[Sir George Creasy]] considered the manoeuvre so dangerous he thought it had been done by mistake.{{sfn|Wiggins|1999|p=31}} Kretschmer's tenth patrol (27 June–21 July) yielded over {{GRT|20,000|link=off}}.{{sfn|Paterson|2018||p=256}} After sinking ''[[List of shipwrecks in July 1940#5 July|Magog]]''—the submarine's first victim—Kretschmer gave the crew a bottle of brandy and directions to Ireland.{{sfn|Paterson|2018||p=80}} Acts of compassion in submarine warfare were \"selective and fickle\" one historian wrote when describing Kretschmer's rescue of a lone man in a raft. Haunted by him, Kretschmer ordered the boat to backtrack until the survivor was found. They provided clothes and alcohol, then transferred him to a lifeboat at the first opportunity.{{sfn|Sturma|2011|p=80}}

Among the victims was the [[Estonia]]n ship, ''Merisaar'', {{GRT|2,126|link=off}}. Kretschmer captured the vessel, the only such ship seized by ''U-99''. The crew abandoned ship and were questioned by Kretschmer. The German crew failed to sink the stationary vessel with torpedoes while the weather ruled out the use of the gun. A prize crew boarded to sail it to [[Bordeaux]]. The ship did not reach port. German aircraft bombed and sank it three days later. Kretschmer docked in [[Lorient]] on 21 July.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=87, 256}} The BdU acquired new bases along the French Atlantic coast after the [[Battle of France]].{{sfn|Terraine|1989|p=770}} A notable failure on the patrol occurred in the interception of [[SS Manistee (1920)|HMS ''Manistee'']]. Kretschmer attempted to sink the ship with gunfire, but return fire and the appearance of an aircraft forced him to submerge. Under water ''U-99'' had  no chance of catching her.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=81}}

Four days later Kretschmer began his eleventh patrol which concluded on 5 August. This third patrol on ''U-99'', took the boat into the North Atlantic, into the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]] and west of Ireland. He sank four ships and damaged three.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=45}} His greatest success was the sinking of ''[[List of shipwrecks in July 1940#28 July|Auckland Star]]'', a {{GRT|13,212|link=off}} ship on 28 July followed by another two totalling {{GRT|12,811|link=off}} on 29 and 31 July. Kretschmer was guided onto convoy OB-191. The 28-ship convoy was poorly defended by a destroyer and a [[corvette]]. Kretschmer was presented with an opportunity to put his one torpedo, one ship into practice.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=98–101}} Kretschmer hit and sank ''[[List of shipwrecks in July 1940#31 July|Jersey City]]'', {{convert|70|nmi|km mi|abbr=off}} northwest of [[Tory Island]]{{sfn|Tennent|2001|p=264}} while damaging three others including the {{GRT|10,973|lnk=off}} ''[[List of shipwrecks in August 1940#2 August|Strinda]]''. The ships used barrels for ballast to prevent them sinking. The crew remained in lifeboats nearby for reboarding once the attack was over.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=98–101}} Following his third war patrol with ''U-99'', Kretschmer was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{Lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}) on 4 August. The presentation was made by Dönitz following his return to Lorient.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|pp=42, 45}}

On ''U-99''{{'}}s fourth war patrol from 4 to 35 September 1940,{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=45}} Kretschmer formed part of a [[wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]] that struck against [[Convoy HX 72]]. The convoy suffered heavy losses while the U-boats escaped unscathed. Kretschmer sank one and damaged two–which he and Prien dispatched the following day.  [[Joachim Schepke]] arrived in ''U-100'' and sank seven. [[Heinrich Bleichrodt]] hit and sank two. 12 ships were sunk in total.{{sfn|Milner|2011||pp=40–41}} Kretschmer's logbook recorded the chaos. It noted the destroyers \"did not know how to help\" and busied themselves firing star shells on a moonlit night.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=41}} The following month, Kretschmer formed part of the pack that attacked and devastated [[Convoy SC 7]]. Bleichrodt reported it and Dönitz succeeded in bringing multiple boats in on it. Kretschmer sank six and disabled a seventh.{{sfn|Milner|2011|pp=40–4}} Kretschmer recommended his [[helmsman]] ''[[Stabsfeldwebel|Stabsobersteuermann]]'' [[Heinrich Petersen (naval officer)|Heinrich Petersen]] for the Knight's Cross after twelve war patrols for saving ''U-99'' from enemy detection. The nomination was approved on 5 November 1940. Petersen had served as Kretschmer's helmsman on every war patrol on both ''U-23'' and ''U-99''.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=97}}

In November and December 1940 ''U-99'' sank three British [[Armed Merchant Cruiser|armed merchant cruisers]] (AMC), [[SS Laurentic (1927)|HMS ''Laurentic'']], [[SS Patroclus (1923)|HMS ''Patroclus'']] and {{HMS|Forfar|F30|6}}. ''Laurentic'' and ''Patroclus'' were attacked on the night of 3/4 November.{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|pp=35, 37}} 51 men died aboard ''Laurentic'', 367 survived. ''Patroclus'' lost 56 crew; 230 survived.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=68}} Kretschmer was awarded the 6th [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] ({{lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub}}) on 4 November 1940.{{sfn|Scherzer|2007|p=474}} ''U-99'' docked four days later, concluding Kretschmer's fourteenth patrol after just ten days at sea.{{sfn|Paterson|2018||p=255}} Upon reaching port, he was summoned to Berlin to meet [[Erich Raeder]]. He was given the opportunity to convey his opinions on the state of the U-boat war. Kretschmer purportedly confined his remarks to the lack of air support from the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', a point Raeder was fully aware. Kretschmer then met Hitler at the [[Reich Chancellery]] and he repeated his opinions on the war situation. Hitler invited Kretschmer to sit in on a lunch meeting with Hitler and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], the [[Soviet Union]]'s ambassador to the Third Reich. Kretschmer's thoughts on Hitler and the subsequent conference are not known.{{sfn|Paterson|2018||pp=161–162}}

Kretschmer departed for his fifteenth patrol on 27 November and returned on 12 December.{{sfn|Paterson|2018||p=255}} In December Kretschmer tried to intercept [[Convoy HX 90]] but encountered only stragglers.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=46}} ''Forfar'' was one and during the sinking, ''HMS Viscount'' appeared forcing Kretschmer to dive. He assumed most of the crew went down with the ship; but there were 159 survivors. 176 men died.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|pp=74, 76–77}} ''Laurentic'' and ''Patroclus'' had been loaded with wooden barrels to increase [[buoyancy]]. It took nine torpedoes and one dud to sink them; the latter was sunk after it stopped to pick up survivors from the former.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=72}} Kretschmer was forced to engage ''Patroclus'' with the deck gun when it appeared to resist the torpedo damage but retreated when the ship fired back. A [[Short Sunderland]] appeared briefly, and Kretschmer was forced to accomplish the destruction of the ship with torpedoes, submerged.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=72}} On 7 December 1940, Kretschmer sank the Dutch freighter ''[[List of shipwrecks in December 1940#7 December|Farmsum]]''; the last success of the year. The ship was loaded with coal, set for [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. The ship sank slowly. Kretschmer learned its identity from frantic radio signals.{{sfn|Paterson|2018||pp=172–173}}

===Defeat and capture===
Several of Kretschmer's senior officers departed the boat before the final patrol. [[Klaus Bargsten]] served aboard ''U-99'' under Kretschmer, before being promoted to captain himself and becoming the sole survivor of {{GS|U-521||2}} on 2 June 1942.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=67–70, 247}}

On 22 February 1941 ''U-99'' left Lorient for the final time. For 13 days Kretschmer sailed without success. ''U-99'' tried in vain to assist Prien in ''U-47'', against OB&nbsp;290. Prien achieved several sinkings, Kretschmer did not; the pair was chased off by destroyers. Prien's reports were picked up by the Luftwaffe which sent [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]]s from I. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–45)#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' of [[Kampfgeschwader 40|''Kampfgeschwader'' 40]] (KG&nbsp;40—40th Bomber Wing) to attack the convoy. The air crews sank eight and damaged several more. Kretschmer continued to search for stragglers and found ''SS Holmlea''. He fired a single torpedo that missed before he lost the ship in thick mist. Prien sank the ship the following day. Prien and Kretschmer cooperated frequently during the course of this patrol - neither would complete it.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=184–186}}

The operation against [[Convoy OB 293]] proved disastrous for the Lorient group. Prien, Kretschmer along with {{GS|U-70|1940|2}} (Matz) and {{GS|UA|1939|2}} attacked the convoy. The ships were protected by an escort group of two [[destroyer]]s, {{HMS|Wolverine|D78|2}} and {{HMS|Verity|D63|2}}, and two [[corvette]]s, {{HMS|Arbutus|K86|2}} and {{HMS|Camellia|K31|2}}.{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|2005|p=62}} As with the group that would eventually sink Kretschmer ten days later, they were experienced and competent.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=52}} Kretschmer attempted a surface night attack using his favourite tactic.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=187–190}} On 7 March Kretschmer sank two ships from the convoy including the {{GRT|20,638|link=off}} ''[[list of shipwrecks in March 1941#7 March|Terje Viken]]''.{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=45}} Four ships were sunk, but two U-boats were sunk, one of them ''U-47''. Prien along with his crew disappeared, presumably in a depth charge attack.{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|2005|pp=62–63}} British reports of the action mention a large red glow appearing deep below the surface amid the depth charge explosions.{{sfn|Terraine|1989|p=314}}

On 16 March 1941 Kretschmer attacked [[Convoy HX 112]]. Kretschmer sank all but one of the ships lost by the convoy.{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=46}} During a counterattack by the escorts ''U-99'' was disabled after repeated [[depth charge]] attacks by the destroyers {{HMS|Walker|D27|2}} and {{HMS|Vanoc|H33|2}}.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=77}} ''U-99'' was driven down to 700 feet—beyond the recognised [[crush depth]]— before control was regained and the ballast tanks blown.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=53}} Kretschmer surfaced and, under fire from the British vessels, scuttled his boat. Three of his men were lost, but Kretschmer and the remainder of ''U-99''{{'}}s crew were captured. That same day the British escorts scored another success against the ''Kriegsmarine'' when the noted U-Boat skipper, [[Joachim Schepke]], was killed aboard {{GS|U-100|1940|2}}, having been depth charged, rammed and sunk by ''Vanoc''.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=77}}

Kretschmer's usual standards of conduct were evident during the sinking of his boat. One signalman sent a message to the escorts \"we are sinking\" and the firing stopped.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=53}} He then sent a message to BdU, \"Two destroyers—depth charges—50,000 tons—Kretschmer.\"{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=53}} Kretschmer signalled ''Walker'' asking for rescue for his men, taking care to ensure as many left the submarine as possible, and assisted some of his crew towards the rescue nets hung from the British destroyer. Kretschmer's strength was evidently failing in the cold ocean; his own rescue was at the hands of a British sailor who climbed down the nets and plucked him from the water.{{sfn|Padfield|1995|p=115}}

===Prisoner of war===
Kretschmer and his crew were landed in [[Liverpool]]. They were sent to [[Lime Street Station]] to be transported to London for interrogation. Kretschmer was taken separately but his crew had to negotiate the streets of Liverpool and were subjected to missiles thrown by angry civilians; the city [[Liverpool Blitz|had been heavily bombed]] and was closely linked with the Atlantic war. He was transported to the [[London Cage]], a facility for [[MI19]] to hold valuable enemy prisoners. The building was located at number 8 [[Kensington Palace Gardens]].{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=230–232}} [[Winston Churchill]] disclosed the capture of Kretschmer to the [[House of Commons]] on 21 March. German radio acknowledged the capture and the death of Schepke. Prien's demise was not disclosed. German propagandists feared the triple loss might be too damaging to morale.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=222}}

Once in London, Royal Navy interrogators questioned the crew. The report, filed in the archives, was named [http://www.uboatarchive.net/U-99A/U-99INT.htm \"U 99\" Interrogation of Survivors April, 1941\"]. The British reported noted of Kretschmer, \"His political views were less extremely Nazi than had been assumed.  On seeing the craters of a stick of bombs near [[Buckingham Palace]] he was genuinely shocked that an attempt had so obviously been made by his countrymen to bomb the Palace. He spoke English quite well, though he lacked practice.  His whole demeanour was calm and quiet, and he seemed anxious to be friendly; he was also less suspicious of British Officers than was his First Lieutenant. Kretschmer stated that he was unmarried.\"<ref>[http://www.uboatarchive.net/U-99A/U-99INT.htm \"Interrogation of U-99 survivors\"]</ref>

Of his personality and view of the war it stated, \"He gave the impression of being a quiet, deliberate man, and looked more like a student than a U-Boat Captain. He prided himself on being able to take advantage of whatever the passing moment offered and made no elaborate plans for attacking convoys. He admitted that he had become weary of the war some time ago, and latterly had got no satisfaction from sinking ship after ship.
\"<ref>[http://www.uboatarchive.net/U-99A/U-99INT.htm \"Interrogation of U-99 survivors\"]</ref>

Following his capture, Kretschmer spent almost seven years as a [[prisoner of war]] (POW) in the hands of the British at No1 POW camp [[Grizedale Hall]]  in [[Cumbria]].{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=202}} In March 1942, the prisoners were transported to Bowmanville Camp near [[Lake Ontario]] in [[Canada]].{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=230}} During his captivity, Kretschmer was promoted in rank to ''[[Korvettenkapitän]]'' (corvette captain) on 19 March 1941, effective as of 1 March 1941, and to ''[[Fregattenkapitän]]'' (frigate captain) on 1 September 1944. In addition, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] ({{lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern}}) on 26 December 1941. He was the fifth member of the German armed forces to be so honored.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=42}}

On 27 August 1941, [[HMS Graph|''U-570'']] was captured by the Royal Navy. The officers were also taken to the prisoner-of-war camp at Grizedale Hall.{{sfn|Blair|1998|p=347}} Kretschmer was senior officer at the camp. An illegal \"[[Court of Honor|Court of Honour]]\" was convened and headed by Kretschmer. They tried commander Hans-Joachim Rahmlow, ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'', and ''U-570''{{'}}s other officers. Rahmlow and his second-in-command, Bernhard Berndt, were found \"guilty of cowardice\"; the other two officers were \"acquitted\". On the night of 18/19 October, Berndt escaped from the camp. A detachment of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] apprehended him, shooting him when he tried to escape. Allied courts and Rahmlow sought justice against Kretschmer after the war, but he was never vigorously pursued for trial for his role in the death of Berndt.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=222–228, 238, 240}} Kretschmer was involved in a second illegal court of honour hearing against the commander of {{GS|U-501||2}}. Its commander , Hugo Förster, was repatriated to Germany and committed suicide before the end of the war.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=228–234}}

In 1943, the German command tried to rescue him (in [[Operation Kiebitz|Operation ''Kiebitz'']]) but that daring plan failed. Four of those years were spent in Canada at [[Bowmanville POW camp]]. Kretschmer was released from captivity on 31 December 1947 and returned to [[Germany]].{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=43}}

==Postwar career, later life==
In 1955, Sir [[Donald Macintyre (Royal Navy officer)|Donald McIntyre]] returned Kretschmer's [[binoculars]], which he had kept in 1941. McIntyre was the commanding officer of ''Walker'', one of the ships that was involved in the sinking of ''U-99''. At the time, Kretschmer was president of the [[:de:Deutscher Marinebund|''Deutscher Marinebund'']], a member club of the [[International Maritime Confederation]].{{sfn|Der Spiegel Volume 46/1955}}

[[File:Marinebundestreffen 1966 (Kiel 38.426).jpg|thumb|[[Flotilla admiral|''Flotillenadmiral'']] Kretschmer in 1966]]
On 1 December 1955, Kretschmer joined [[West Germany]]'s navy, at the time named the ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' (Federal Navy), holding the rank of ''Fregattenkapitän''. He participated in the 2nd officers training course held at the former [[NS-Ordensburgen|NS-''Ordensburg'']] [[Ordensburg Sonthofen|Sonthofen]].{{refn|The ''Ordensburg'' Sonthofen was later renamed ''Generaloberst-Beck-Kaserne''.|group=\"Note\"}} There, he became inspection group leader at the acceptance organization.<ref group=Tr>inspection group leader at the acceptance organization—''Prüfgruppenleiter bei der Annahmeorganisation''</ref> On 16 June 1956, he was tasked with the creation of [[:de:Schulgeschwader (Bundesmarine)|1. ''Geleitgeschwader'']] (1st Escort Squadron) which he commanded from 3 January to 15 October 1957. He then attended a training course (16 October 1957 – 28 February 1958) for [[amphibious forces]] in the United States.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=43}}

From 1 March to 31 October 1958, Kretschmer served as ''Admiralstabsoffizier'' (Asto—officer of the admiralty staff) with the [[:de:Flottenkommando|Fleet Command]]. On 1 November 1958, he was transferred to the position of commander of the ''Bundesmarine''{{'}}s [[:de:Amphibische Gruppe|''Amphibische Streitkräfte'']] (\"amphibious forces\"), a position he held until 15 January 1962. During this command, he was promoted to ''[[Kapitän zur See]]'' (captain at sea/captain) on 12 December 1958.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=43}} On 16 January 1962, Kretschmer was appointed head of the department for naval task force training and naval tactics with the [[Armed Forces Staff (Germany)|''Führungsstab der Marine'']] (Navy Staff) with the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Defence]].<ref group=Tr>head of the department for naval task force training and naval tactics—''Leiter des Referates Verbandsausbildung und Seetaktik''</ref> On 28 August 1963, he was transferred to the [[NATO Defense College]] in Paris.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=43}} Kretschmer served in this function until 18 June 1964 when he was appointed chief-of-staff of the [[Allied Forces Baltic Approaches|''Befehlshaber der Seestreitkräfte der Nordsee'']] (German national Commander Naval Forces North Sea). On 1 June 1965, he was promoted to ''[[Flottillenadmiral]]'' (flotilla admiral), a rank which he initially held on probation. That day, he was made chief-of-staff of the NATO command [[Allied Forces Baltic Approaches|COMNAVBALTAP]] at [[Kiel]], taking command on 15 June. Six months later, on 15 December, he officially became ''Flottillenadmiral''. His command ended on 31 March 1969. The next day, Kretschmer was transferred to the [[:de:Amt für Militärkunde|''Amt für Militärkunde'']] (Department of Military Studies), retiring on 30 September 1970.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|2003|p=43}}

In later years Kretschmer was often interviewed for television and radio programmes about the Second World War; he appeared in the British 1974 documentary series ''[[The World at War]]''. In the mid-1990s he was interviewed for the computer simulation game ''[[Aces of the Deep (video game)|Aces of the Deep]]'', as one of several former U-boat skippers whose input was excerpted specially for the CD-Rom version of the game.

===Death===
While on holiday in [[Bavaria]] in the summer of 1998, Kretschmer died in an accident during a boating expedition on the [[Danube]] to celebrate his 50th wedding anniversary, at the age of 86. He was on a holiday cruise from [[Regensburg]] to [[Budapest]] when he tried climbing some almost vertical steps. A fall caused fatal injuries. His body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.

{{short description|Overseas expansion under the Crown of Castile}}
{{euromericas}}
[[File:Pendón real de Medina del Campo.svg|thumb| Flag of Spanish [[conquistador]]s with crown of Castile on a red flag, used by [[Hernán Cortés]], [[Francisco Pizarro]] and others]]

The overseas expansion under the [[Crown of Castile]] was initiated under the royal authority and first accomplished by the Spanish ''[[conquistador]]s''. The Americas were invaded and incorporated into the [[Spanish Empire]], with the exception of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], [[British Canada|Canada]], the north-eastern [[United States]] and several other small countries in South America and The Caribbean. The crown created civil and religious structures to administer the region. The motivations for colonial expansion were trade and the spread of the [[Catholic]] faith through [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] conversions.

Beginning with the 1492 arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the Caribbean and continuing control of vast territory for over three centuries, the [[Spanish Empire]] would expand across the [[Caribbean]] Islands, half of [[South America]], most of [[Central America]] and much of [[North America]] (including present day [[Mexico]], [[Florida]] and the [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] and [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coastal]] regions of the [[United States]]). It is estimated that during the colonial period (1492–1832), a total of 1.86 million Spaniards settled in the Americas and a further 3.5 million immigrated during the post-colonial era (1850–1950); the estimate is 250,000 in the 16th century, and most during the 18th century as immigration was encouraged by the new Bourbon Dynasty. In contrast, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#European colonization|the indigenous population plummeted]] by an estimated 80% in the first century and a half following Columbus's voyages, primarily through the spread of [[Old World|Afro-Eurasian]] [[Infection|diseases]].<ref name=\"Histoire\">\"La catastrophe démographique\" (The Demographic Catastrophe) in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°322, July–August 2007, p. 17</ref> This has been argued to be the first large-scale act of [[genocide]] [[Genocides in history#1490 to 1914|in the modern era]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Forsythe|first=David P.|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 4|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195334029|p=297|ref= harv}}</ref> although this claim is disputed due to the introduction of disease, which is considered a byproduct of the [[Columbian exchange]]. [[Mestizaje|Racial mixing]] was a central process in the Spanish colonization of the Americas, and ultimately led to the [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] identity, which combines African, [[Hispanic]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures.

Spain enjoyed a cultural [[Spanish Golden Age|golden age]] in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when silver and gold from American mines increasingly financed a long series of European and North African wars. In the early 19th century, the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] resulted in the secession and subsequent [[balkanization]] of most Spanish territories in the Americas, except for [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]], which were finally given up in 1898, following the [[Spanish–American War]], together with [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] in the Pacific. Spain's loss of these last territories politically ended the Spanish rule in the Americas.

==Conquests==

The Catholic Monarchs [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella of Castile]], Queen of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and her husband [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]], King of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], pursued a policy of joint rule of their kingdoms and created a single [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]]. Even though Castile and Aragon were ruled jointly by their respective monarchs, they remained separate kingdoms. The Catholic Monarchs gave official approval for the plans of Genoese mariner [[Christopher Columbus]] for a voyage to reach India by sailing West. The funding came from the queen of Castile, so the profits from Spanish expedition flowed to Castile. In the extension of Spanish sovereignty to its overseas territories, authority for expeditions of discovery, conquest, and settlement resided in the monarchy.<ref>Ida Altman, S.L. Cline, and Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003 pp. 35–36.</ref>

===West Indies===
Columbus made four voyages to the [[West Indies]] as the monarchs granted Columbus the governorship of the new territories, and financed more of his trans-Atlantic journeys. He founded [[La Navidad]] on the island later named [[Hispaniola]] (now divided into Haiti and the Dominican Republic), in what is the present-day [[Haiti]] on his first voyage. After its destruction by the indigenous [[Taino]] people, the town of Isabella was begun in 1493, on his second voyage. In 1496 his brother, [[Bartholomew Columbus|Bartholomew]], founded [[Santo Domingo]]. By 1500, despite a high death rate, there were between 300 and 1000 Spanish settled in the area. The local [[Taíno]] people continued to resist, refusing to plant crops and abandoning their Spanish-occupied villages. The first mainland explorations were followed by a phase of inland expeditions and conquest. In 1500 the city of [[Nueva Cádiz]] was founded on the island of [[Cubagua]], [[Venezuela]], followed by the founding of [[Aragua (state)|Santa Cruz]] by [[Alonso de Ojeda]] in present-day [[Guajira Peninsula|Guajira peninsula]]. [[Cumaná]] in Venezuela was the first permanent settlement founded by [[Europe]]ans in the mainland [[Americas]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edosucre.gov.ve/documentos/pdf/CUMANA%20EN%20LA%20HISTORIA.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320091649/http://edosucre.gov.ve/documentos/pdf/CUMANA%20EN%20LA%20HISTORIA.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-20 }} Sucre State Government: ''Cumaná in History'' (Spanish)</ref> in 1501 by [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan]] [[friar]]s, but due to successful attacks by the indigenous people, it had to be refounded several times, until [[Diego Hernández de Serpa]]'s foundation in 1569. The Spanish founded San Sebastian de Uraba in 1509 but abandoned it within the year. There is indirect evidence that the first permanent Spanish mainland settlement established in the Americas was [[Santa María la Antigua del Darién]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Tibesar, A.S.|year=1957|title=The Franciscan Province of the Holy Cross of Espanañola, 1505–1559|journal=The Americas|volume=13|issue=4|pages=377–389|jstor=979442|doi=10.2307/979442}}</ref>

===Mexico===

[[File:Ruta de Cortés.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Map depicting Cortés invasion route]]

The Spanish conquest of Mexico is generally understood to be the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] (1519–21) which was the base for later conquests of other regions. Later conquests were protracted campaigns with less spectacular results than the conquest of the Aztecs. The [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]], the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala]], the war of Mexico's west, and the [[Chichimeca War]] in northern Mexico expanded Spanish control over territory and indigenous populations.<ref>Robert S. Chamberlain, ''The Conquest and Colonization of Yucatan''. Washington DC: Carnegie Institution.</ref><ref>Ida Altman, ''The War for Mexico's West''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2010.</ref><ref>Philip W. Powell, ''Soldiers, Indians, and Silver: North America's Last Frontier War''. Tempe: Center for Latin America Studies, Arizona State University 1975. First published by University of California Press 1952.</ref> But not until the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]] was the conquest of the Aztecs matched in scope by the victory over the Inca empire in 1532.

The Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire was led by [[Hernán Cortés]]. The victory over the Aztecs was relatively quick, from 1519 to 1521, and aided by his [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] and other allies from indigenous city-states or [[altepetl]]. These polities allied against the [[Aztec]] empire, to which they paid tribute following conquest or threat of conquest, leaving the city-states' political hierarchy and social structure in place.

The [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] was a much longer campaign, from 1551 to 1697, against the [[Maya peoples]] in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] of present-day Mexico and northern [[Central America]]. [[Hernán Cortés]]' landing ashore at present day [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] and founding the Spanish city there on April 22, 1519 marked the beginning of 300 years of Spanish hegemony over the region. The assertion of royal control over the Kingdom of New Spain and the initial Spanish conquerors took over a decade, with importance of the region meriting the creation of the Viceroyalty of [[New Spain]]. Established by Charles V in 1535, the first viceroy was Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]].

Spain colonized and exerted control of [[Alta California]] through the [[Spanish missions in California]] until the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833]].

===Peru===
{{Main|Spanish conquest of Peru}}
[[File:Balboa südsee.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] claiming possession of the South Sea ([[Pacific Ocean]])]]
[[File:Conquest peru 1531.jpg|thumb|right|Map depicting the route of Pizarro from Panama to Cuzco]]

In 1532 at the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] a group of Spaniards under [[Francisco Pizarro]] and their [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#South America|indigenous Andean]] [[Indian auxiliaries]] native allies ambushed and captured the Emperor [[Atahualpa]] of the [[Inca Empire]]. It was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting to subdue the mightiest [[empire]] in the [[Americas]]. In the following years Spain extended its rule over the Empire of the [[Inca civilization]].

The Spanish took advantage of a recent civil war between the factions of the two brothers Emperor [[Atahualpa]] and [[Huáscar]], and the enmity of [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#South America|indigenous nations]] the Incas had subjugated, such as the [[Huanca people|Huancas]], [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and [[Cañari]]s. In the following years the [[conquistador]]s and indigenous allies extended control over Greater Andes Region. The [[Viceroyalty of Perú]] was established in 1542. The [[Neo-Inca State|last Inca stronghold]] was conquered by the Spanish in 1572.

Peru was the last territory in the continent under Spanish occupation, which ended on 9 December 1824 at the Battle of Ayacucho  (Spanish rule continued until 1898 in Cuba and Puerto Rico).

===Río de la Plata and Paraguay===
European explorers arrived in [[Río de la Plata]] in 1516. Their first Spanish settlement in this zone was the [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Fort of Sancti Spiritu]] established in 1527 next to the [[Paraná River]]. [[Buenos Aires]], a permanent colony, was established in 1536 and in 1537 [[Asunción]] was established in the area that is now [[Paraguay]]. Buenos Aires suffered attacks by the indigenous peoples that forced the settlers away, and in 1541 the site was abandoned. A second (and permanent) settlement was established in 1580 by [[Juan de Garay]], who arrived by sailing down the [[Paraná River]] from [[Asunción]] (now the capital of [[Paraguay]]). He dubbed the settlement \"Santísima Trinidad\" and its port became \"Puerto de Santa María de los Buenos Aires.\" The city came to be the head of the [[Governorate of the Río de la Plata]] and in 1776 elevated to be the capital of the new [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]].

===New Granada===

Between 1537 and 1543, six{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}<!--Federmann from the east, De Belalcázar from the south and De Quesada from the north, which others?--> Spanish expeditions entered highland Colombia, conquered the [[Muisca Confederation]], and set up the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] ({{lang-es|Nuevo Reino de Granada}}). [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] was the leading conquistador with [[Hernán Pérez de Quesada|his brother Hernán]] second in command.<ref>Clements Markham, ''The Conquest of New Granada'' (1912) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4P1LAAAAIAAJ online]</ref> It was governed by the president of the [[Audiencia of Bogotá]], and comprised an area corresponding mainly to modern-day [[Colombia]] and parts of [[Venezuela]]. The [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquistadors]] originally organized it as a [[Captain general|captaincy general]] within the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. The crown established the ''[[Audiencia Real|audiencia]]'' in 1549. Ultimately, the kingdom became part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] first in 1717 and permanently in 1739. After several attempts to set up independent states in the 1810s, the kingdom and the viceroyalty ceased to exist altogether in 1819 with the establishment of [[Gran Colombia]].<ref>Avellaneda Navas, José Ignacio.

=== Organization and administration of empire ===
The empire in the Indies was a newly established dependency of the kingdom of Castile alone, so crown power was not impeded by any existing [[cortes Generales|cortes]] (i.e. parliament), administrative or ecclesiastical institution, or seigneurial group.<ref>{{cite book |first=J.H. |last=Parry |title=The Sale of Public Office in the Spanish Indies Under the Habsburgs |publisher=University of California Press |series=Ibero-Americana 37 |year=1953 |p= 4}}</ref> The crown sought to establish and maintain control over its overseas possessions through a complex, hierarchical bureaucracy, which in many ways was decentralized. The crown asserted is authority and sovereignty of the territory and vassals it claimed, collected taxes, maintained public order, meted out justice, and established policies for governance of large indigenous populations. Many institutions established in Castile found expression in The Indies from the early colonial period. [[Higher education in Spain|Spanish universities]] expanded to train lawyer-bureaucrats (''letrados'') for administrative positions in Spain and its overseas empire.

The end of the Habsburg dynasty in 1700 saw major [[Bourbon Reforms|administrative reforms]] in the eighteenth century under the Bourbon monarchy, starting with the first Spanish Bourbon monarch, [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] (r. 1700-1746) and reaching its apogee under [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] (r. 1759-1788). The reorganization of administration has been called \"a revolution in government.\"{{sfn|Brading|1971|pp=33-94}} Reforms sought to centralize government control through reorganization of administration, reinvigorate the economies of Spain and the Spanish empire through changes in mercantile and fiscal policies, defend Spanish colonies and territorial claims through the establishment of a standing military, undermine the power of the Catholic church, and rein in the power of the American-born elites.<ref name=\"Bourbon Reforms\">Kuethe, Allan J. \"The Bourbon Reforms\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc= vol. 1, p. 399-401}}</ref>

====Early institutions of governance====
The crown relied on ecclesiastics as important councilors and royal officials in the governance of their overseas territories. Archbishop [[Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca]], Isabella's confessor, was tasked with reining in Columbus's independence. He strongly influenced the formulation of colonial policy under the Catholic Monarchs, and was instrumental in establishing the [[Casa de Contratación]] (1503), which enabled crown control over trade and immigration. Ovando fitted out Magellan's voyage of circumnavigation, and became the first President of the [[Council of the Indies]] in 1524.<ref>Nader, Helen, \"Antonio de Fonseca\" in {{harvnb|Bedini|1992|pages=282–283}}</ref> Ecclesiastics also functioned as administrators overseas in the early Caribbean period, particularly Frey [[Nicolás de Ovando]], who was sent to investigate the administration of [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], the governor appointed to succeed Christopher Columbus.<ref>Cook, Noble David. \"Nicolás de Ovando\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 4, p. 254}}</ref> Later ecclesiastics served as interim viceroys, general inspectors (visitadores), and other high posts.

The crown established control over trade and emigration to the Indies with the 1503 establishment the Casa de Contratación (House of Trade) in Seville. Ships and cargoes were registered, and emigrants vetted to prevent migration of anyone not of [[old Christian]] heritage and facilitated the migration of families and women.<ref>{{cite book

The politics of asserting royal authority opposite to Columbus caused the suppression of his privileges in The Indies and the creation of territorial governance under royal authority. These governorates, also called as provinces, were the basic of the territorial government of the Indies,<ref>{{cite book| last = Andreo García | first = Juan | title = Historia y sociabilidad: homenaje a la profesora María del Carmen Melendreras Gimeno | language = Spanish | publisher = EDITUM | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-84-8371-654-0 | editor-first1 = Juan |editor-last1=Bautista Vilar |editor-first2=Antonio  |editor-last2=Peñafiel Ramón |editor-first3=Antonio |editor-last3=Irigoyen López | chapter = Su Majestad quiere gobernar: la Administración española en Indias durante los siglos XVI y XVII | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=keYAW_4N_YwC&lpg=PA282&dq=&hl=es&pg=PA279#v=onepage&q=&f=true | page = 279}}</ref> and arose as the territories were conquered and colonized.{{sfn|Góngora|1998|p = 99}} To carry out the expedition (''entrada''), which entailed exploration, conquest, and initial settlement of the territory, the king, as owner of the Indies, agreed ''capitulación'' (an itemized contract) with the specifics of the conditions of the expedition in a particular territory. The individual leaders of expeditions (''adelantados'') assumed the expenses of the venture and in return received as reward the grant from the government of the conquered territories;{{sfn|Lagos Carmona|1985|p=119}} and in addition, they received instructions about treating the aborigens.{{sfn|Lagos Carmona|1985|p=122}}

[[File:Bartolomedelascasas.jpg|thumb|upright|Fray [[Bartolome de Las Casas]], [[Protector of the Indians]]]]

After the end of the period of conquests, it was necessary to manage extensive and different territories with a strong bureaucracy. In the face of the impossibility of the Castilian institutions to take care of the New World affairs, other new institutions were created.{{sfn|Historia general de España|1992| page = 601}}

As the basic political entity it was the governorate, or province. The governors exercised judicial ordinary functions of first instance, and prerogatives of government legislating by ordinances.{{sfn|Góngora|1998|p=97}} To these political functions of the governor, it could be joined the military ones, according to military requirements, with the rank of [[Captain general]].<ref>{{cite book

Provinces in the Spanish Empire had a royal treasury controlled by a set of ''officiales reales'' (royal officials). The officials of the royal treasury included up to four positions: a ''[[wikt:tesorero|tesorero]]'' (treasurer), who guarded money on hand and made payments; a ''[[wikt:contador|contador]]'' (accountant or comptroller), who recorded income and payments, maintained records, and interpreted royal instructions; a ''factor'', who guarded weapons and supplies belonging to the king, and disposed of tribute collected in the province; and a ''[[wikt:veedor|veedor]]'' (overseer), who was responsible for contacts with native inhabitants of the province, and collected the king's share of any war booty. The treasury officials were appointed by the king, and were largely independent of the authority of the governor. Treasury officials were generally paid out of the income from the province and were normally prohibited from engaging in personal income-producing activities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bushnell|first=Amy|title=The King's Coffer: Proprietors of the Spanish Florida Treasury 1565-1702|year=1981|publisher=University Presses of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-0690-2|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00014878/00001|pages=1–2|access-date=May 23, 2019}}</ref>

The indigenous populations in the Caribbean became the focus of the crown in its roles as sovereigns of the empire and patron of the Catholic Church. Spanish conquerors holding grants of indigenous labor in [[encomienda]] ruthlessly exploited them Spanish. A number of friars in the early period came to the vigorous defense of the indigenous populations, who were new converts to Christianity. Prominent [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars in Santo Domingo, especially [[Antonio de Montesinos]] and [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] denounced the maltreatment and pressed the crown to act to protect the indigenous populations. The crown enacted [[Laws of Burgos]] (1513) and the [[Spanish Requirement of 1513|Requerimiento]] to curb the power of the Spanish conquerors and give indigenous populations the opportunity to peacefully embrace Spanish authority and Christianity. Neither was effective in its purpose. Las Casas was officially appointed [[Protector of the Indians]] and spent his life arguing forcefully on their behalf. The [[New Laws]] of 1542, limiting the power of encomenderos, were a result.

Beginning in 1522 in the newly conquered Mexico, government units in the Spanish Empire had a royal treasury controlled by a set of ''officiales reales'' (royal officials). There were also sub-treasuries at important ports and mining districts. The officials of the royal treasury at each level of government typically included two to four positions: a ''tesorero'' (treasurer), the senior official who guarded money on hand and made payments; a ''contador'' (accountant or [[comptroller]]), who recorded income and payments, maintained records, and interpreted royal instructions; a ''factor'', who guarded weapons and supplies belonging to the king, and disposed of tribute collected in the province; and a ''veedor'' (overseer), who was responsible for contacts with native inhabitants of the province, and collected the king's share of any war booty. The ''veedor'', or overseer, position quickly disappeared in most jurisdictions, subsumed into the position of ''factor''. Depending on the conditions in a jurisdiction, the position of ''factor/veedor'' was often eliminated, as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Bushnell|1981|pages=1–2}}; {{harvnb|Chipman|2005}}

The treasury officials were appointed by the king, and were largely independent of the authority of the viceroy, audiencia president or governor. On the death, unauthorized absence, retirement or removal of a governor, the treasury officials would jointly govern the province until a new governor appointed by the king could take up his duties. Treasury officials were supposed to be paid out of the income from the province, and were normally prohibited from engaging in income-producing activities.{{sfnm|Bushnell|1981|1p=1–2|Chipman|2005}}

====Spanish Law and indigenous peoples====
[[File:Valladolid San Gregorio 20080815.jpg|thumb|upright|Colegio de San Gregorio, [[Valladolid]], where the Laws of the Indies were promulgated]]

The protection of the indigenous populations from enslavement and exploitation by Spanish settlers were established in the [[Laws of Burgos]], 1512–1513. The laws were the first codified set of laws governing the behavior of Spanish [[settlers]] in the Americas, particularly with regards to treatment of native Indians in the institution of the [[encomienda]]. They forbade the maltreatment of natives, and endorsed the [[Indian Reductions]] with attempts of [[proselytize|conversion]] to Catholicism.<ref>{{citation |chapter-url=http://faculty.smu.edu/bakewell/BAKEWELL/texts/burgoslaws.html |chapter=1512–1513: Laws of Burgos |title=Colonial Latin America |publisher=Peter Bakewell |year=1998 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref> Upon their failure to effectively protect the indigenous and following the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] and the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]], more stringent laws to control conquerors' and settlers' exercise of power, especially their maltreatment of the indigenous populations, were promulgated, known as the [[New Laws]] (1542). The crown aimed to prevent the formation of an aristocracy in the Indies not under crown control.

[[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabel]] was the first monarch that laid the first stone for the protection of the indigenous peoples in her testament in which the Catholic monarch prohibited the enslavement of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Esparza |first1=José Javier |title=La cruzada del océano: La gran aventura de la conquista de América |date=2015 |publisher=La Esfera de los Libros |language=es |isbn=9788490602638 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XRIACwAAQBAJ}}</ref> Then the first such in 1542; the legal thought behind them was the basis of modern [[Francisco de Vitoria|International law]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scott |first1=James Brown |title=The Spanish origin of international law |date=2000 |publisher=Lawbook Exchange |location=Union, NJ |isbn=978-1-58477-110-4 |edition= 4th}}</ref> 

The [[Valladolid debate]] (1550–1551) was the first moral debate in European history to discuss the rights and treatment of a [[Indigenous people of the Americas|colonized people]] by colonizers. Held in the [[Colegio de San Gregorio]], in the [[Spain|Spanish]] city of [[Valladolid]], it was a moral and theological debate about the [[European colonization of the Americas|colonization of the Americas]], its justification for the conversion to [[Catholicism]] and more specifically about the relations between the European settlers and the natives of the [[New World]]. It consisted of a number of opposing views about the way natives were to be integrated into colonial life, their conversion to Christianity and their rights and obligations. According to the French historian Jean Dumont The ''Valladolid debate'' was a major turning point in world history ''“In that moment in Spain appeared the dawn of the human rights”''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dumont |first1=Jean |title=El amanecer de los derechos del hombre : la controversia de Valladolid |date=1997 |publisher=Encuentro |location=Madrid  |language=es |isbn=978-8474904154}}</ref>

====Council of the Indies====

In 1721, at the beginning of the Bourbon monarchy, the crown transferred the main responsibility for governing the overseas empire from the Council of the Indies to the Ministry of the Navy and the Indies, which were subsequently divided into two separate ministries in 1754.<ref name=\"Bourbon Reforms\" />

====Viceroyalties====
{{Main|Viceroyalty of New Spain|Viceroyalty of Peru|Viceroyalty of New Granada|Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata}}
[[File:Vista de la Plaza Mayor de la Ciudad de México - Cristobal de Villalpando.jpg|thumb|View of the Plaza Mayor of Mexico City and the viceroy's palace, by [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]], 1695]]

The impossibility of the physical presence of the monarch and the necessity of strong royal governance in The Indies resulted in the appointment of [[viceroy]]s (\"vice-kings\"), the direct representation of the monarch, in both civil and ecclesiastical spheres. Viceroyalties were the largest territory unit of administration in the civil and religious spheres and the boundaries of civil and ecclesiastical governance coincided by design, to ensure crown control over both bureaucracies.{{sfn|Mecham|1966|p=26}} Until the eighteenth century, there were just two viceroyalties, with the Viceroyalty of New Spain (founded 1535) administering North America, a portion of the Caribbean, and the Philippines, and the viceroyalty of Peru (founded 1542) having jurisdiction over Spanish South America. Viceroys served as the vice-patron of the Catholic Church, including the [[Holy Office of the Inquisition|Inquisition]], established in the seats of the viceroyalties (Mexico City and Peru). Viceroys were responsible for good governance of their territories, economic development, and humane treatment of the indigenous populations.<ref>Burkholder, Mark A. \"Viceroyalty, Viceroy\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc= vol. 5, p. 408-409}}</ref>

In the eighteenth-century reforms, the Viceroyalty of Peru was reorganized, splitting off portions to form the Viceroyalty of New Granada (Colombia) (1739) and the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata (Argentina) (1776), leaving Peru with jurisdiction over Peru, Charcas, and Chile. Viceroys were of high social standing, almost without exception born in Spain, and served fixed terms.

==== Audiencias, the High Courts ====
{{Main|Real Audiencia}}
[[File:POMA0488.jpg|thumb|upright|Members of the ''Real Audiencia'' (Royal Audience) of Lima, the ''presidente'', ''alcaldes de corte'', ''fiscal'' and ''alguacil mayor''. ([[Nueva Crónica y Buen Gobierno]], p. 488)]]

The [[Audiencia Real|Audiencias]] were initially constituted by the crown as a key administrative institution with royal authority and loyalty to the crown as opposed to conquerors and first settlers.{{sfn|Góngora|1998|p=100}} Although constituted as the highest judicial authority in their territorial jurisdiction, they also had executive and legislative authority, and served as the executive on an interim basis. Judges (''oidores'') held \"formidable power. Their role in judicial affairs and in overseeing the implementation of royal legislation made their decisions important for the communities they served.\" Since their appointments were for life or the pleasure of the monarch, they had a continuity of power and authority that viceroys and captains-general lacked because of their shorter-term appointments.<ref name=\"burkholder audencia\">Burkholder, \"Audiencia\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 1, p. 235-236}}</ref> They were the \"center of the administrative system [and] gave the government of the Indies a strong basis of permanence and continuity.\"<ref>Fernando Cervantes, \"Audiencias\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 109.</ref>

Their main function was judicial, as a court of justice of second instance —court of appeal— in penal and civil matters, but also the Audiencias were courts the first instance in the city where it had its headquarters, and also in the cases involving the Royal Treasury.<ref name=\"virrey\">{{cite book

Audiencias were a significant base of power and influence for American-born elites, starting in the late sixteenth century, with nearly a quarter of appointees being born in the Indies by 1687. During a financial crisis in the late seventeenth century, the crown began selling Audiencia appointments, and American-born Spaniards held 45% of Audiencia appointments. Although there were restrictions of appointees' ties to local elite society and participation in the local economy, they acquired dispensations from the cash-strapped crown. Audiencia judgments and other functions became more tied to the locality and less to the crown and impartial justice.

During the [[Bourbon Reforms]] in the mid-eighteenth century, the crown systematically sought to centralize power in its own hands and diminish that of its overseas possessions, appointing peninsular-born Spaniards to Audiencias. American-born elite men complained bitterly about the change, since they lost access to power that they had enjoyed for nearly a century.<ref name=\"burkholder audencia\" />

====Civil administrative districts====
{{Main|Corregidor (position)|Intendant}}
During the early colonial era and under the Habsburgs, the crown established a regional layer of colonial jurisdiction in the institution of [[Corregimiento]], which was between the [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]] and [[Cabildo (council)|town councils]]. Corregimiento expanded \"royal authority from the urban centers into the countryside and over the indigenous population.\"<ref name=\"Corregidor\">Burkholder, Mark A. \"Corregidor\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 2, p. 272}}</ref> As with many colonial institutions, corregimiento had its roots in Castile when the [[Catholic Monarchs]] centralize power over municipalities. In the Indies, corregimiento initially functioned to bring control over Spanish settlers who exploited the indigenous populations held in [[encomienda]], in order to protect the shrinking indigenous populations and prevent the formation of an aristocracy of conquerors and powerful settlers. The royal official in charge of a district was the [[Corregidor (position)|Corregidor]], who was appointed by the viceroy, usually for a five-year term. Corregidores collected the tribute from indigenous communities and regulated forced indigenous labor. [[Alcaldía mayor|Alcaldías mayores]] were larger districts with a royal appointee, the ''Alcalde mayor''.

As the indigenous populations declined, the need for corregimiento decreased and then suppressed, with the alcaldía mayor remaining an institution until it was replaced in the eighteenth-century [[Bourbon Reforms]] by royal officials, [[Intendant]]s. The salary of officials during the Habsburg era were paltry, but the corregidor or alcalde mayor in densely populated areas of indigenous settlement with a valuable product could use his office for personal enrichment. As with many other royal posts, these positions were sold, starting in 1677.<ref name=Corregidor /> The Bourbon-era intendants were appointed and relatively well paid.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Brungardt |first=Maurice |title=Corregidor/Corregimiento |volume=1 |encyclopedia=Iberia and the Americas: culture, politics, and history|location=Santa Barbara |publisher=ABC Clio |year=2006 |pages= 361–363}}</ref>

====Ecclesiastical organization====
[[File:Vista de la Catedral de Puebla desde la terraza del Museo Amparo..jpg|thumb|left|[[Puebla Cathedral]]]]

During the early colonial period, the crown authorized friars of [[Catholic religious order]]s ([[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscans]], [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], and [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinians]]) to function as priests during the conversion of indigenous populations. During the early [[Age of Discovery]], the diocesan clergy in Spain was poorly educated and considered of a low moral standing, and the Catholic Monarchs were reluctant to allow them to spearhead evangelization. Each order set up networks of parishes in the various regions (provinces), sited in existing Indian settlements, where Christian churches were built and where evangelization of the indigenous was based.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ricard |first=Robert |title=The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico |url=https://archive.org/details/spiritualconques00rica |url-access=registration |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1966}}</ref> However, after the 1550s, the crown increasingly favored the diocesan clergy over the religious orders since the diocesan clergy was under the direct authority of the crown, while religious orders were with their own internal regulations and leadership. The crown had authority to draw the boundaries for dioceses and parishes. The creation of the ecclesiastical hierarchy with priests who not members of religious orders, those known as the diocesan or [[secular clergy]], marked a turning point in the crown's control over the religious sphere. In 1574, Philip II promulgated the Order of Patronage (Ordenaza del Patronato) ordering the religious orders to turn over their parishes to the secular clergy, a policy that secular clerics had long sought for the central areas of empire, with their large indigenous populations. Although implementation was slow and incomplete, it was an assertion of royal power over the clergy and the quality of parish priests improved, since the Ordenanza mandated competitive examination to fill vacant positions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Padden |first=Robert C. |title=The Ordenanza del Patronazgo of 1574 |journal=The Americas |number=12 |date=1956 |pp=333–354}}

The Jesuits resisted crown control, refusing to pay the [[tithe]] on their estates that supported the ecclesiastical hierarchy and came into conflict with bishops. The most prominent example is in Puebla, Mexico, when Bishop [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]] was driven from his bishopric by the Jesuits. The bishop challenged the Jesuits' continuing to hold Indian parishes and function as priests without the required royal licenses. His fall from power is viewed as an example of the weakening of the crown in the mid-seventeenth century since it failed to protect their duly appointed bishop.{{sfn|Brading|1993|pp=241-247}} The crown [[Suppression of the Jesuits|expelled the Jesuits]] from Spain and The Indies in 1767 during the [[Bourbon Reforms]].

==== Cabildos or town councils ====
{{Main|Cabildo (council)}}
[[File:Salta-Cabildo1.jpg|thumb|Cabildo in the city of [[Salta]] (Argentina)]]

Spanish settlers sought to live in towns and cities, with governance being accomplished through the town council or ''Cabildo''. The cabildo was composed of the prominent residents (''vecinos'') of the municipality, so that governance was restricted to a male elite, with majority of the population exercising power. Cities were governed on the same pattern as in Spain and in the Indies the city was the framework of Spanish life. The cities were Spanish and the countryside indigenous.{{sfn|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|p= 66-67}} In areas of previous indigenous empires with settled populations, the crown also melded existing indigenous rule into a Spanish pattern, with the establishment of cabildos and the participation of indigenous elites as officials holding Spanish titles. There were a variable number of councilors (''regidores''), depending on the size of the town, also two municipal judges (''alcaldes menores''), who were judges of first instance, and also other officials as police chief, inspector of supplies, court clerk, and a public herald.{{sfn|Bennassar|2001|p= 98}} They were in charge of distributing land to the neighbors, establishing local taxes, dealing with the public order, inspecting jails and hospitals, preserving the roads and public works such as irrigation ditchs and bridges, supervising the public health, regulating the festive activities, monitoring market prices, or the protection of Indians.<ref>{{cite book | last = Delgado de Cantú | first = Gloria M. | title = El mundo moderno y contemporáneo | language = Spanish | publisher = Pearson Educación | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-970-26-0665-9 | volume = 1 | page = 90 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=1oJ22dmhBZIC&lpg=PT89&dq=&pg=PT90#v=onepage&q&f=true}}

After the reign of Philip II, the municipal offices, including the councilors, were auctioned to alleviate the need for money of the Crown, even the offices could also be sold, which became hereditary,{{sfn|Bennassar|2001|p=99}} so that the government of the cities went on to hands of urban oligarchies.<ref>{{cite book

Most Spanish settlers came to the Indies as permanent residents, established families and businesses, and sought advancement in the colonial system, such as membership of cabildos, so that they were in the hands of local, American-born (''crillo'') elites. During the Bourbon era, even when the crown systematically appointed peninsular-born Spaniards to royal posts rather than American-born, the cabildos remained in the hands of local elites.{{sfn|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|p=322}}

====Frontier institutions – presidio and mission====
{{Main|Presidio|Spanish missions in the Americas}}
[[File:Presidio of San Diego 1820 map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The San Diego presidio in California]]

As the empire expanded into areas of less dense indigenous populations, the crown created a chain of [[presidio]]s, military forts or garrisons, that provided Spanish settlers protection from Indian attacks. In Mexico during the sixteenth-century [[Chichimec War]] guarded the transit of silver from the mines of Zacatecas to Mexico City. As many as 60 salaried soldiers were garrisoned in presidios.{{sfn|Gibson|1966|p=191-192}} Presidios had a resident commanders, who set up commercial enterprises of imported merchandise, selling it to soldiers as well as Indian allies.{{sfn|Altman|Cline|Javier Pescador|2003 |pp=321-322}}

The other frontier institution was the religious [[mission (station)|mission]] to convert the indigenous populations. Missions were established with royal authority through the [[Patronato real]]. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were effective missionaries in frontier areas until their expulsion from Spain and its empire in 1767. The Franciscans took over some former Jesuit missions and continued the expansion of areas incorporated into the empire. Although their primary focus was on religious conversion, missionaries served as \"diplomatic agents, peace emissaries to hostile tribes ... and they were also expected to hold the line against nomadic nonmissionary Indians as well as other European powers.\"<ref>Ramírez, Susan E. \"Missions: Spanish America\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 4, p. 77}}</ref> On the frontier of empire, Indians were seen as ''sin razón'', (\"without reason\"); non-Indian populations were described as ''[[gente de razón]]'' (\"people of reason\"), who could be mixed-race [[casta]]s or black and had greater social mobility in frontier regions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Miranda |first=Gloria E. |title=Racial and Cultural Dimensions of \"Gente de Razón\" Status in Spanish and Mexican California |journal=Southern California Quarterly |volume=70 |number=3 |date=1988 |pages=265–278|doi=10.2307/41171310 |jstor=41171310 }}</ref>

Spain's administration of its colonies in the Americas was divided into the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] 1535 (capital, [[Mexico City]]), and the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] 1542 (capital, [[Lima]]). In the 18th century the additional [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] 1717 (capital, Bogotá), and [[Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata]] 1776 (capital, Buenos Aires) were established from portions of the Viceroyalty of Peru. The change diminished the political and economic power of the viceroyalty and opened formal connections between the mining district of Upper Peru and the port of Buenos Aires.

The system of crown rule evolved from the era of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], which established the [[Council of the Indies]], to the establishment of viceroyalties in Mexico and Peru following their conquests in the Habsburg era, and then into an [[Intendant]] system in the eighteenth century as part of the [[Bourbon Reforms]]. The reform was aimed at increasing crown control over its colonies, raising more revenue, and promoting greater efficiency.

{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence}}
[[File:Spanish America XVIII Century (Most Expansion).png|thumb|Spanish colonialization in the [[Americas]].]]

During the Napoleonic [[Peninsular War]] in Europe between France and Spain, assemblies called ''[[Junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]]'' were established to rule in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]].
The [[Libertadores]] (Spanish and Portuguese for \"Liberators\") were the principal leaders of the Spanish American wars of independence. They were predominantly ''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'' (Americas-born people of European ancestry, mostly Spanish or Portuguese), [[bourgeois]] and influenced by [[liberalism]] and in some cases with military training in the [[Homeland|mother country]].

In 1809 the first declarations of independence from Spanish rule occurred in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. The first two were in the Alto Perú, present-day [[Bolivia]], at Charcas (present day [[Sucre]], May 25), and [[La Paz]] (July 16); and the third in present-day [[Ecuador]] at [[Quito]] (August 10). In 1810 Mexico declared independence, with the [[Mexican War of Independence]] following for over a decade. In 1821 [[Treaty of Córdoba]] established Mexican independence from Spain and concluded the War. The [[Plan of Iguala]] was part of the peace treaty to establish a constitutional foundation for an independent Mexico.

These began a movement for [[Spanish American wars of independence|colonial independence]] that spread to Spain's other colonies in the Americas. The ideas from the [[French Revolution|French]] and the [[American Revolution]] influenced the efforts. All of the colonies, except Cuba and Puerto Rico, attained independence by the 1820s. The [[British Empire]] offered support, wanting to end the Spanish monopoly on trade with its colonies in the Americas.
[[File:El Correo entrando en el puerto de La Habana.jpg|thumb|Havana, [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Spanish Cuba]] in the 19th century]]
In 1898, the [[United States]] achieved victory in the [[Spanish–American War]] with Spain, ending the Spanish colonial era. Spanish possession and rule of its remaining colonies in the Americas ended in that year with its sovereignty transferred to the United States. The United States took occupation of [[Cuba]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. Puerto Rico continues to be a possession of the United States, now officially continues as a [[self-governing]] [[unincorporated territory]].

It has been estimated that over 1.86 million Spaniards emigrated to Latin America in the period between 1492 and 1824, with millions more continuing to immigrate following independence.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=lvvynCzrJOwC&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=emigraci%C3%B3n+espa%C3%B1ola+a+las+indias+cifras#v=onepage&q=emigraci%C3%B3n%20espa%C3%B1ola%20a%20las%20indias%20cifras&f=false | title=La emigración española a América, 1765–1824| isbn=9788474688566| last1=MacIas| first1=Rosario Marquez| last2=MacÍas| first2=Rosario Márquez| year=1995}}</ref>

In Hispaniola, the indigenous Taíno pre-contact population before the arrival of Columbus of several hundred thousand had declined to sixty thousand by 1509. 

The population of the Native American population in [[Mexico]] declined by an estimated 90% (reduced to 1–2.5 million people) by the early 17th century.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In [[Peru]], the indigenous Amerindian pre-contact population of around 6.5 million declined to 1 million by the early 17th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} The overwhelming cause of the decline in both Mexico and Peru was [[infectious diseases]], such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html |title=The Story Of... Smallpox |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2019-03-02}}</ref> although the brutality of the [[Encomienda]] also played a significant part in the population decline.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Of the history of the indigenous population of [[California]], [[Sherburne F. Cook]] (1896–1974) was the most painstakingly careful researcher. From decades of research, he made estimates for the pre-contact population and the history of demographic decline during the Spanish and post-Spanish periods. According to Cook, the indigenous Californian population at first contact, in 1769, was about 310,000 and had dropped to 25,000 by 1910. The vast majority of the decline happened after the Spanish period, during the [[Mexico|Mexican]] and [[United States|US]] periods of Californian history (1821–1910), with the most dramatic collapse (200,000 to 25,000) occurring in the US period (1846–1910).<ref>Baumhoff, Martin A. 1963.

The second factor was disease. ...A third factor, which strongly intensified the effect of the other two, was the social and physical disruption visited upon the Indian. He was driven from his home by the thousands, starved, beaten, raped, and murdered with impunity. He was not only given no assistance in the struggle against foreign diseases, but was prevented from adopting even the most elementary measures to secure his food, clothing, and shelter. The utter devastation caused by the white man was literally incredible, and not until the population figures are examined does the extent of the havoc become evident.\"Cook, Sherburne F. 1976b.

{{short description|Overseas expansion under the Crown of Castile}}
{{euromericas}}
[[File:Pendón real de Medina del Campo.svg|thumb| Flag of Spanish [[conquistador]]s with crown of Castile on a red flag, used by [[Hernán Cortés]], [[Francisco Pizarro]] and others]]

The overseas expansion under the [[Crown of Castile]] was initiated under the royal authority and first accomplished by the Spanish ''[[conquistador]]s''. The Americas were invaded and incorporated into the [[Spanish Empire]], with the exception of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], [[British Canada|Canada]], the north-eastern [[United States]] and several other small countries in South America and The Caribbean. The crown created civil and religious structures to administer the region. The motivations for colonial expansion were trade and the spread of the [[Catholic]] faith through [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] conversions.

Beginning with the 1492 arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the Caribbean and continuing control of vast territory for over three centuries, the [[Spanish Empire]] would expand across the [[Caribbean]] Islands, half of [[South America]], most of [[Central America]] and much of [[North America]] (including present day [[Mexico]], [[Florida]] and the [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] and [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coastal]] regions of the [[United States]]). It is estimated that during the colonial period (1492–1832), a total of 1.86 million Spaniards settled in the Americas and a further 3.5 million immigrated during the post-colonial era (1850–1950); the estimate is 250,000 in the 16th century, and most during the 18th century as immigration was encouraged by the new Bourbon Dynasty. In contrast, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#European colonization|the indigenous population plummeted]] by an estimated 80% in the first century and a half following Columbus's voyages, primarily through the spread of [[Old World|Afro-Eurasian]] [[Infection|diseases]].<ref name=\"Histoire\">\"La catastrophe démographique\" (The Demographic Catastrophe) in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°322, July–August 2007, p. 17</ref> This has been argued to be the first large-scale act of [[genocide]] [[Genocides in history#1490 to 1914|in the modern era]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Forsythe|first=David P.|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 4|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195334029|p=297|ref= harv}}</ref> although this claim is disputed due to the introduction of disease, which is considered a byproduct of the [[Columbian exchange]]. [[Mestizaje|Racial mixing]] was a central process in the Spanish colonization of the Americas, and ultimately led to the [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] identity, which combines African, [[Hispanic]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures.

Spain enjoyed a cultural [[Spanish Golden Age|golden age]] in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when silver and gold from American mines increasingly financed a long series of European and North African wars. In the early 19th century, the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] resulted in the secession and subsequent [[balkanization]] of most Spanish territories in the Americas, except for [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]], which were finally given up in 1898, following the [[Spanish–American War]], together with [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] in the Pacific. Spain's loss of these last territories politically ended the Spanish rule in the Americas.

==Conquests==

The Catholic Monarchs [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella of Castile]], Queen of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and her husband [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]], King of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], pursued a policy of joint rule of their kingdoms and created a single [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]]. Even though Castile and Aragon were ruled jointly by their respective monarchs, they remained separate kingdoms. The Catholic Monarchs gave official approval for the plans of Genoese mariner [[Christopher Columbus]] for a voyage to reach India by sailing West. The funding came from the queen of Castile, so the profits from Spanish expedition flowed to Castile. In the extension of Spanish sovereignty to its overseas territories, authority for expeditions of discovery, conquest, and settlement resided in the monarchy.<ref>Ida Altman, S.L. Cline, and Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003 pp. 35–36.</ref>

[[File:Imperios Español y Portugués 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]

===West Indies===
Columbus made four voyages to the [[West Indies]] as the monarchs granted Columbus the governorship of the new territories, and financed more of his trans-Atlantic journeys. He founded [[La Navidad]] on the island later named [[Hispaniola]] (now divided into Haiti and the Dominican Republic), in what is the present-day [[Haiti]] on his first voyage. After its destruction by the indigenous [[Taino]] people, the town of Isabella was begun in 1493, on his second voyage. In 1496 his brother, [[Bartholomew Columbus|Bartholomew]], founded [[Santo Domingo]]. By 1500, despite a high death rate, there were between 300 and 1000 Spanish settled in the area. The local [[Taíno]] people continued to resist, refusing to plant crops and abandoning their Spanish-occupied villages. The first mainland explorations were followed by a phase of inland expeditions and conquest. In 1500 the city of [[Nueva Cádiz]] was founded on the island of [[Cubagua]], [[Venezuela]], followed by the founding of [[Aragua (state)|Santa Cruz]] by [[Alonso de Ojeda]] in present-day [[Guajira Peninsula|Guajira peninsula]]. [[Cumaná]] in Venezuela was the first permanent settlement founded by [[Europe]]ans in the mainland [[Americas]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edosucre.gov.ve/documentos/pdf/CUMANA%20EN%20LA%20HISTORIA.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320091649/http://edosucre.gov.ve/documentos/pdf/CUMANA%20EN%20LA%20HISTORIA.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-20 }} Sucre State Government: ''Cumaná in History'' (Spanish)</ref> in 1501 by [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan]] [[friar]]s, but due to successful attacks by the indigenous people, it had to be refounded several times, until [[Diego Hernández de Serpa]]'s foundation in 1569. The Spanish founded San Sebastian de Uraba in 1509 but abandoned it within the year. There is indirect evidence that the first permanent Spanish mainland settlement established in the Americas was [[Santa María la Antigua del Darién]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Tibesar, A.S.|year=1957|title=The Franciscan Province of the Holy Cross of Espanañola, 1505–1559|journal=The Americas|volume=13|issue=4|pages=377–389|jstor=979442|doi=10.2307/979442}}</ref>

===Mexico===

[[File:Ruta de Cortés.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Map depicting Cortés invasion route]]

The Spanish conquest of Mexico is generally understood to be the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] (1519–21) which was the base for later conquests of other regions. Later conquests were protracted campaigns with less spectacular results than the conquest of the Aztecs. The [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]], the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala]], the war of Mexico's west, and the [[Chichimeca War]] in northern Mexico expanded Spanish control over territory and indigenous populations.<ref>Robert S. Chamberlain, ''The Conquest and Colonization of Yucatan''. Washington DC: Carnegie Institution.</ref><ref>Ida Altman, ''The War for Mexico's West''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2010.</ref><ref>Philip W. Powell, ''Soldiers, Indians, and Silver: North America's Last Frontier War''. Tempe: Center for Latin America Studies, Arizona State University 1975. First published by University of California Press 1952.</ref> But not until the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]] was the conquest of the Aztecs matched in scope by the victory over the Inca empire in 1532.

The Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire was led by [[Hernán Cortés]]. The victory over the Aztecs was relatively quick, from 1519 to 1521, and aided by his [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] and other allies from indigenous city-states or [[altepetl]]. These polities allied against the [[Aztec]] empire, to which they paid tribute following conquest or threat of conquest, leaving the city-states' political hierarchy and social structure in place.

The [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] was a much longer campaign, from 1551 to 1697, against the [[Maya peoples]] in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] of present-day Mexico and northern [[Central America]]. [[Hernán Cortés]]' landing ashore at present day [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] and founding the Spanish city there on April 22, 1519 marked the beginning of 300 years of Spanish hegemony over the region. The assertion of royal control over the Kingdom of New Spain and the initial Spanish conquerors took over a decade, with importance of the region meriting the creation of the Viceroyalty of [[New Spain]]. Established by Charles V in 1535, the first viceroy was Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]].

Spain colonized and exerted control of [[Alta California]] through the [[Spanish missions in California]] until the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833]].

===Peru===
{{Main|Spanish conquest of Peru}}
[[File:Balboa südsee.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] claiming possession of the South Sea ([[Pacific Ocean]])]]
[[File:Conquest peru 1531.jpg|thumb|right|Map depicting the route of Pizarro from Panama to Cuzco]]

In 1532 at the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] a group of Spaniards under [[Francisco Pizarro]] and their [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#South America|indigenous Andean]] [[Indian auxiliaries]] native allies ambushed and captured the Emperor [[Atahualpa]] of the [[Inca Empire]]. It was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting to subdue the mightiest [[empire]] in the [[Americas]]. In the following years Spain extended its rule over the Empire of the [[Inca civilization]].

The Spanish took advantage of a recent civil war between the factions of the two brothers Emperor [[Atahualpa]] and [[Huáscar]], and the enmity of [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#South America|indigenous nations]] the Incas had subjugated, such as the [[Huanca people|Huancas]], [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and [[Cañari]]s. In the following years the [[conquistador]]s and indigenous allies extended control over Greater Andes Region. The [[Viceroyalty of Perú]] was established in 1542. The [[Neo-Inca State|last Inca stronghold]] was conquered by the Spanish in 1572.

Peru was the last territory in the continent under Spanish occupation, which ended on 9 December 1824 at the Battle of Ayacucho  (Spanish rule continued until 1898 in Cuba and Puerto Rico).

===Río de la Plata and Paraguay===
European explorers arrived in [[Río de la Plata]] in 1516. Their first Spanish settlement in this zone was the [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Fort of Sancti Spiritu]] established in 1527 next to the [[Paraná River]]. [[Buenos Aires]], a permanent colony, was established in 1536 and in 1537 [[Asunción]] was established in the area that is now [[Paraguay]]. Buenos Aires suffered attacks by the indigenous peoples that forced the settlers away, and in 1541 the site was abandoned. A second (and permanent) settlement was established in 1580 by [[Juan de Garay]], who arrived by sailing down the [[Paraná River]] from [[Asunción]] (now the capital of [[Paraguay]]). He dubbed the settlement \"Santísima Trinidad\" and its port became \"Puerto de Santa María de los Buenos Aires.\" The city came to be the head of the [[Governorate of the Río de la Plata]] and in 1776 elevated to be the capital of the new [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]].

===New Granada===

Between 1537 and 1543, six{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}<!--Federmann from the east, De Belalcázar from the south and De Quesada from the north, which others?--> Spanish expeditions entered highland Colombia, conquered the [[Muisca Confederation]], and set up the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] ({{lang-es|Nuevo Reino de Granada}}). [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] was the leading conquistador with [[Hernán Pérez de Quesada|his brother Hernán]] second in command.<ref>Clements Markham, ''The Conquest of New Granada'' (1912) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4P1LAAAAIAAJ online]</ref> It was governed by the president of the [[Audiencia of Bogotá]], and comprised an area corresponding mainly to modern-day [[Colombia]] and parts of [[Venezuela]]. The [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquistadors]] originally organized it as a [[Captain general|captaincy general]] within the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. The crown established the ''[[Audiencia Real|audiencia]]'' in 1549. Ultimately, the kingdom became part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] first in 1717 and permanently in 1739. After several attempts to set up independent states in the 1810s, the kingdom and the viceroyalty ceased to exist altogether in 1819 with the establishment of [[Gran Colombia]].<ref>Avellaneda Navas, José Ignacio.

[[File:Salta-Cabildo1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Argentine [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo council]]]]

=== Organization and administration of empire ===
The empire in the Indies was a newly established dependency of the kingdom of Castile alone, so crown power was not impeded by any existing [[cortes Generales|cortes]] (i.e. parliament), administrative or ecclesiastical institution, or seigneurial group.<ref>{{cite book |first=J.H. |last=Parry |title=The Sale of Public Office in the Spanish Indies Under the Habsburgs |publisher=University of California Press |series=Ibero-Americana 37 |year=1953 |p= 4}}</ref> The crown sought to establish and maintain control over its overseas possessions through a complex, hierarchical bureaucracy, which in many ways was decentralized. The crown asserted is authority and sovereignty of the territory and vassals it claimed, collected taxes, maintained public order, meted out justice, and established policies for governance of large indigenous populations. Many institutions established in Castile found expression in The Indies from the early colonial period. [[Higher education in Spain|Spanish universities]] expanded to train lawyer-bureaucrats (''letrados'') for administrative positions in Spain and its overseas empire.

The end of the Habsburg dynasty in 1700 saw major [[Bourbon Reforms|administrative reforms]] in the eighteenth century under the Bourbon monarchy, starting with the first Spanish Bourbon monarch, [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] (r. 1700-1746) and reaching its apogee under [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] (r. 1759-1788). The reorganization of administration has been called \"a revolution in government.\"{{sfn|Brading|1971|pp=33-94}} Reforms sought to centralize government control through reorganization of administration, reinvigorate the economies of Spain and the Spanish empire through changes in mercantile and fiscal policies, defend Spanish colonies and territorial claims through the establishment of a standing military, undermine the power of the Catholic church, and rein in the power of the American-born elites.<ref name=\"Bourbon Reforms\">Kuethe, Allan J. \"The Bourbon Reforms\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc= vol. 1, p. 399-401}}</ref>

====Early institutions of governance====
The crown relied on ecclesiastics as important councilors and royal officials in the governance of their overseas territories. Archbishop [[Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca]], Isabella's confessor, was tasked with reining in Columbus's independence. He strongly influenced the formulation of colonial policy under the Catholic Monarchs, and was instrumental in establishing the [[Casa de Contratación]] (1503), which enabled crown control over trade and immigration. Ovando fitted out Magellan's voyage of circumnavigation, and became the first President of the [[Council of the Indies]] in 1524.<ref>Nader, Helen, \"Antonio de Fonseca\" in {{harvnb|Bedini|1992|pages=282–283}}</ref> Ecclesiastics also functioned as administrators overseas in the early Caribbean period, particularly Frey [[Nicolás de Ovando]], who was sent to investigate the administration of [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], the governor appointed to succeed Christopher Columbus.<ref>Cook, Noble David. \"Nicolás de Ovando\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 4, p. 254}}</ref> Later ecclesiastics served as interim viceroys, general inspectors (visitadores), and other high posts.

The crown established control over trade and emigration to the Indies with the 1503 establishment the Casa de Contratación (House of Trade) in Seville. Ships and cargoes were registered, and emigrants vetted to prevent migration of anyone not of [[old Christian]] heritage and facilitated the migration of families and women.<ref>{{cite book

The politics of asserting royal authority opposite to Columbus caused the suppression of his privileges in The Indies and the creation of territorial governance under royal authority.

Provinces in the Spanish Empire had a royal treasury controlled by a set of ''officiales reales'' (royal officials). The officials of the royal treasury included up to four positions: a ''[[wikt:tesorero|tesorero]]'' (treasurer), who guarded money on hand and made payments; a ''[[wikt:contador|contador]]'' (accountant or comptroller), who recorded income and payments, maintained records, and interpreted royal instructions; a ''factor'', who guarded weapons and supplies belonging to the king, and disposed of tribute collected in the province; and a ''[[wikt:veedor|veedor]]'' (overseer), who was responsible for contacts with native inhabitants of the province, and collected the king's share of any war booty. The treasury officials were appointed by the king, and were largely independent of the authority of the governor. Treasury officials were generally paid out of the income from the province and were normally prohibited from engaging in personal income-producing activities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bushnell|first=Amy|title=The King's Coffer: Proprietors of the Spanish Florida Treasury 1565-1702|year=1981|publisher=University Presses of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-0690-2|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00014878/00001|pages=1–2|access-date=May 23, 2019}}</ref>

The indigenous populations in the Caribbean became the focus of the crown in its roles as sovereigns of the empire and patron of the Catholic Church. Spanish conquerors holding grants of indigenous labor in [[encomienda]] ruthlessly exploited them Spanish. A number of friars in the early period came to the vigorous defense of the indigenous populations, who were new converts to Christianity. Prominent [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars in Santo Domingo, especially [[Antonio de Montesinos]] and [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] denounced the maltreatment and pressed the crown to act to protect the indigenous populations. The crown enacted [[Laws of Burgos]] (1513) and the [[Spanish Requirement of 1513|Requerimiento]] to curb the power of the Spanish conquerors and give indigenous populations the opportunity to peacefully embrace Spanish authority and Christianity. Neither was effective in its purpose. Las Casas was officially appointed [[Protector of the Indians]] and spent his life arguing forcefully on their behalf. The [[New Laws]] of 1542, limiting the power of encomenderos, were a result.

Beginning in 1522 in the newly conquered Mexico, government units in the Spanish Empire had a royal treasury controlled by a set of ''officiales reales'' (royal officials). There were also sub-treasuries at important ports and mining districts. The officials of the royal treasury at each level of government typically included two to four positions: a ''tesorero'' (treasurer), the senior official who guarded money on hand and made payments; a ''contador'' (accountant or [[comptroller]]), who recorded income and payments, maintained records, and interpreted royal instructions; a ''factor'', who guarded weapons and supplies belonging to the king, and disposed of tribute collected in the province; and a ''veedor'' (overseer), who was responsible for contacts with native inhabitants of the province, and collected the king's share of any war booty. The ''veedor'', or overseer, position quickly disappeared in most jurisdictions, subsumed into the position of ''factor''. Depending on the conditions in a jurisdiction, the position of ''factor/veedor'' was often eliminated, as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Bushnell|1981|pages=1–2}}; {{harvnb|Chipman|2005}}

The treasury officials were appointed by the king, and were largely independent of the authority of the viceroy, audiencia president or governor. On the death, unauthorized absence, retirement or removal of a governor, the treasury officials would jointly govern the province until a new governor appointed by the king could take up his duties. Treasury officials were supposed to be paid out of the income from the province, and were normally prohibited from engaging in income-producing activities.{{sfnm|Bushnell|1981|1p=1–2|Chipman|2005}}

====Spanish Law and indigenous peoples====
[[File:Valladolid San Gregorio 20080815.jpg|thumb|upright|Colegio de San Gregorio, [[Valladolid]], where the Laws of the Indies were promulgated]]

The protection of the indigenous populations from enslavement and exploitation by Spanish settlers were established in the [[Laws of Burgos]], 1512–1513. The laws were the first codified set of laws governing the behavior of Spanish [[settlers]] in the Americas, particularly with regards to treatment of native Indians in the institution of the [[encomienda]]. They forbade the maltreatment of natives, and endorsed the [[Indian Reductions]] with attempts of [[proselytize|conversion]] to Catholicism.<ref>{{citation |chapter-url=http://faculty.smu.edu/bakewell/BAKEWELL/texts/burgoslaws.html |chapter=1512–1513: Laws of Burgos |title=Colonial Latin America |publisher=Peter Bakewell |year=1998 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref> Upon their failure to effectively protect the indigenous and following the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] and the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]], more stringent laws to control conquerors' and settlers' exercise of power, especially their maltreatment of the indigenous populations, were promulgated, known as the [[New Laws]] (1542). The crown aimed to prevent the formation of an aristocracy in the Indies not under crown control.

[[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabel]] was the first monarch that laid the first stone for the protection of the indigenous peoples in her testament in which the Catholic monarch prohibited the enslavement of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Esparza |first1=José Javier |title=La cruzada del océano: La gran aventura de la conquista de América |date=2015 |publisher=La Esfera de los Libros |language=es |isbn=9788490602638 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XRIACwAAQBAJ}}</ref> Then the first such in 1542; the legal thought behind them was the basis of modern [[Francisco de Vitoria|International law]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scott |first1=James Brown |title=The Spanish origin of international law |date=2000 |publisher=Lawbook Exchange |location=Union, NJ |isbn=978-1-58477-110-4 |edition= 4th}}</ref> 

The [[Valladolid debate]] (1550–1551) was the first moral debate in European history to discuss the rights and treatment of a [[Indigenous people of the Americas|colonized people]] by colonizers. Held in the [[Colegio de San Gregorio]], in the [[Spain|Spanish]] city of [[Valladolid]], it was a moral and theological debate about the [[European colonization of the Americas|colonization of the Americas]], its justification for the conversion to [[Catholicism]] and more specifically about the relations between the European settlers and the natives of the [[New World]]. It consisted of a number of opposing views about the way natives were to be integrated into colonial life, their conversion to Christianity and their rights and obligations. According to the French historian Jean Dumont The ''Valladolid debate'' was a major turning point in world history ''“In that moment in Spain appeared the dawn of the human rights”''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dumont |first1=Jean |title=El amanecer de los derechos del hombre : la controversia de Valladolid |date=1997 |publisher=Encuentro |location=Madrid  |language=es |isbn=978-8474904154}}</ref>

====Viceroyalties====
{{Main|Viceroyalty of New Spain|Viceroyalty of Peru|Viceroyalty of New Granada|Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata}}
[[File:Vista de la Plaza Mayor de la Ciudad de México - Cristobal de Villalpando.jpg|thumb|View of the Plaza Mayor of Mexico City and the viceroy's palace, by [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]], 1695]]

The impossibility of the physical presence of the monarch and the necessity of strong royal governance in The Indies resulted in the appointment of [[viceroy]]s (\"vice-kings\"), the direct representation of the monarch, in both civil and ecclesiastical spheres. Viceroyalties were the largest territory unit of administration in the civil and religious spheres and the boundaries of civil and ecclesiastical governance coincided by design, to ensure crown control over both bureaucracies.{{sfn|Mecham|1966|p=26}} Until the eighteenth century, there were just two viceroyalties, with the Viceroyalty of New Spain (founded 1535) administering North America, a portion of the Caribbean, and the Philippines, and the viceroyalty of Peru (founded 1542) having jurisdiction over Spanish South America. Viceroys served as the vice-patron of the Catholic Church, including the [[Holy Office of the Inquisition|Inquisition]], established in the seats of the viceroyalties (Mexico City and Peru). Viceroys were responsible for good governance of their territories, economic development, and humane treatment of the indigenous populations.<ref>Burkholder, Mark A. \"Viceroyalty, Viceroy\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc= vol. 5, p. 408-409}}</ref>

In the eighteenth-century reforms, the Viceroyalty of Peru was reorganized, splitting off portions to form the Viceroyalty of New Granada (Colombia) (1739) and the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata (Argentina) (1776), leaving Peru with jurisdiction over Peru, Charcas, and Chile. Viceroys were of high social standing, almost without exception born in Spain, and served fixed terms.

==== Audiencias, the High Courts ====
{{Main|Real Audiencia}}
[[File:POMA0488.jpg|thumb|upright|Members of the ''Real Audiencia'' (Royal Audience) of Lima, the ''presidente'', ''alcaldes de corte'', ''fiscal'' and ''alguacil mayor''. ([[Nueva Crónica y Buen Gobierno]], p. 488)]]

The [[Audiencia Real|Audiencias]] were initially constituted by the crown as a key administrative institution with royal authority and loyalty to the crown as opposed to conquerors and first settlers.{{sfn|Góngora|1998|p=100}} Although constituted as the highest judicial authority in their territorial jurisdiction, they also had executive and legislative authority, and served as the executive on an interim basis. Judges (''oidores'') held \"formidable power. Their role in judicial affairs and in overseeing the implementation of royal legislation made their decisions important for the communities they served.\" Since their appointments were for life or the pleasure of the monarch, they had a continuity of power and authority that viceroys and captains-general lacked because of their shorter-term appointments.<ref name=\"burkholder audencia\">Burkholder, \"Audiencia\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 1, p. 235-236}}</ref> They were the \"center of the administrative system [and] gave the government of the Indies a strong basis of permanence and continuity.\"<ref>Fernando Cervantes, \"Audiencias\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 109.</ref>

Their main function was judicial, as a court of justice of second instance —court of appeal— in penal and civil matters, but also the Audiencias were courts the first instance in the city where it had its headquarters, and also in the cases involving the Royal Treasury.<ref name=\"virrey\">{{cite book

Audiencias were a significant base of power and influence for American-born elites, starting in the late sixteenth century, with nearly a quarter of appointees being born in the Indies by 1687. During a financial crisis in the late seventeenth century, the crown began selling Audiencia appointments, and American-born Spaniards held 45% of Audiencia appointments. Although there were restrictions of appointees' ties to local elite society and participation in the local economy, they acquired dispensations from the cash-strapped crown. Audiencia judgments and other functions became more tied to the locality and less to the crown and impartial justice.

During the [[Bourbon Reforms]] in the mid-eighteenth century, the crown systematically sought to centralize power in its own hands and diminish that of its overseas possessions, appointing peninsular-born Spaniards to Audiencias. American-born elite men complained bitterly about the change, since they lost access to power that they had enjoyed for nearly a century.<ref name=\"burkholder audencia\" />

====Civil administrative districts====
{{Main|Corregidor (position)|Intendant}}
During the early colonial era and under the Habsburgs, the crown established a regional layer of colonial jurisdiction in the institution of [[Corregimiento]], which was between the [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]] and [[Cabildo (council)|town councils]]. Corregimiento expanded \"royal authority from the urban centers into the countryside and over the indigenous population.\"<ref name=\"Corregidor\">Burkholder, Mark A. \"Corregidor\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 2, p. 272}}</ref> As with many colonial institutions, corregimiento had its roots in Castile when the [[Catholic Monarchs]] centralize power over municipalities. In the Indies, corregimiento initially functioned to bring control over Spanish settlers who exploited the indigenous populations held in [[encomienda]], in order to protect the shrinking indigenous populations and prevent the formation of an aristocracy of conquerors and powerful settlers. The royal official in charge of a district was the [[Corregidor (position)|Corregidor]], who was appointed by the viceroy, usually for a five-year term. Corregidores collected the tribute from indigenous communities and regulated forced indigenous labor. [[Alcaldía mayor|Alcaldías mayores]] were larger districts with a royal appointee, the ''Alcalde mayor''.

As the indigenous populations declined, the need for corregimiento decreased and then suppressed, with the alcaldía mayor remaining an institution until it was replaced in the eighteenth-century [[Bourbon Reforms]] by royal officials, [[Intendant]]s. The salary of officials during the Habsburg era were paltry, but the corregidor or alcalde mayor in densely populated areas of indigenous settlement with a valuable product could use his office for personal enrichment. As with many other royal posts, these positions were sold, starting in 1677.<ref name=Corregidor /> The Bourbon-era intendants were appointed and relatively well paid.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Brungardt |first=Maurice |title=Corregidor/Corregimiento |volume=1 |encyclopedia=Iberia and the Americas: culture, politics, and history|location=Santa Barbara |publisher=ABC Clio |year=2006 |pages= 361–363}}</ref>

====Ecclesiastical organization====
[[File:Vista de la Catedral de Puebla desde la terraza del Museo Amparo..jpg|thumb|left|[[Puebla Cathedral]]]]

During the early colonial period, the crown authorized friars of [[Catholic religious order]]s ([[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscans]], [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], and [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinians]]) to function as priests during the conversion of indigenous populations. During the early [[Age of Discovery]], the diocesan clergy in Spain was poorly educated and considered of a low moral standing, and the Catholic Monarchs were reluctant to allow them to spearhead evangelization. Each order set up networks of parishes in the various regions (provinces), sited in existing Indian settlements, where Christian churches were built and where evangelization of the indigenous was based.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ricard |first=Robert |title=The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico |url=https://archive.org/details/spiritualconques00rica |url-access=registration |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1966}}</ref> However, after the 1550s, the crown increasingly favored the diocesan clergy over the religious orders since the diocesan clergy was under the direct authority of the crown, while religious orders were with their own internal regulations and leadership. The crown had authority to draw the boundaries for dioceses and parishes. The creation of the ecclesiastical hierarchy with priests who not members of religious orders, those known as the diocesan or [[secular clergy]], marked a turning point in the crown's control over the religious sphere. In 1574, Philip II promulgated the Order of Patronage (Ordenaza del Patronato) ordering the religious orders to turn over their parishes to the secular clergy, a policy that secular clerics had long sought for the central areas of empire, with their large indigenous populations. Although implementation was slow and incomplete, it was an assertion of royal power over the clergy and the quality of parish priests improved, since the Ordenanza mandated competitive examination to fill vacant positions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Padden |first=Robert C. |title=The Ordenanza del Patronazgo of 1574 |journal=The Americas |number=12 |date=1956 |pp=333–354}}

The Jesuits resisted crown control, refusing to pay the [[tithe]] on their estates that supported the ecclesiastical hierarchy and came into conflict with bishops. The most prominent example is in Puebla, Mexico, when Bishop [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]] was driven from his bishopric by the Jesuits. The bishop challenged the Jesuits' continuing to hold Indian parishes and function as priests without the required royal licenses. His fall from power is viewed as an example of the weakening of the crown in the mid-seventeenth century since it failed to protect their duly appointed bishop.{{sfn|Brading|1993|pp=241-247}} The crown [[Suppression of the Jesuits|expelled the Jesuits]] from Spain and The Indies in 1767 during the [[Bourbon Reforms]].

==== Cabildos or town councils ====
{{Main|Cabildo (council)}}
[[File:Salta-Cabildo1.jpg|thumb|Cabildo in the city of [[Salta]] (Argentina)]]

Spanish settlers sought to live in towns and cities, with governance being accomplished through the town council or ''Cabildo''. The cabildo was composed of the prominent residents (''vecinos'') of the municipality, so that governance was restricted to a male elite, with majority of the population exercising power. Cities were governed on the same pattern as in Spain and in the Indies the city was the framework of Spanish life. The cities were Spanish and the countryside indigenous.{{sfn|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|p= 66-67}} In areas of previous indigenous empires with settled populations, the crown also melded existing indigenous rule into a Spanish pattern, with the establishment of cabildos and the participation of indigenous elites as officials holding Spanish titles. There were a variable number of councilors (''regidores''), depending on the size of the town, also two municipal judges (''alcaldes menores''), who were judges of first instance, and also other officials as police chief, inspector of supplies, court clerk, and a public herald.{{sfn|Bennassar|2001|p= 98}} They were in charge of distributing land to the neighbors, establishing local taxes, dealing with the public order, inspecting jails and hospitals, preserving the roads and public works such as irrigation ditchs and bridges, supervising the public health, regulating the festive activities, monitoring market prices, or the protection of Indians.<ref>{{cite book | last = Delgado de Cantú | first = Gloria M. | title = El mundo moderno y contemporáneo | language = Spanish | publisher = Pearson Educación | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-970-26-0665-9 | volume = 1 | page = 90 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=1oJ22dmhBZIC&lpg=PT89&dq=&pg=PT90#v=onepage&q&f=true}}

After the reign of Philip II, the municipal offices, including the councilors, were auctioned to alleviate the need for money of the Crown, even the offices could also be sold, which became hereditary,{{sfn|Bennassar|2001|p=99}} so that the government of the cities went on to hands of urban oligarchies.<ref>{{cite book

Most Spanish settlers came to the Indies as permanent residents, established families and businesses, and sought advancement in the colonial system, such as membership of cabildos, so that they were in the hands of local, American-born (''crillo'') elites. During the Bourbon era, even when the crown systematically appointed peninsular-born Spaniards to royal posts rather than American-born, the cabildos remained in the hands of local elites.{{sfn|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|p=322}}

====Frontier institutions – presidio and mission====
{{Main|Presidio|Spanish missions in the Americas}}
[[File:Presidio of San Diego 1820 map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The San Diego presidio in California]]

As the empire expanded into areas of less dense indigenous populations, the crown created a chain of [[presidio]]s, military forts or garrisons, that provided Spanish settlers protection from Indian attacks. In Mexico during the sixteenth-century [[Chichimec War]] guarded the transit of silver from the mines of Zacatecas to Mexico City. As many as 60 salaried soldiers were garrisoned in presidios.{{sfn|Gibson|1966|p=191-192}} Presidios had a resident commanders, who set up commercial enterprises of imported merchandise, selling it to soldiers as well as Indian allies.{{sfn|Altman|Cline|Javier Pescador|2003 |pp=321-322}}

The other frontier institution was the religious [[mission (station)|mission]] to convert the indigenous populations. Missions were established with royal authority through the [[Patronato real]]. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were effective missionaries in frontier areas until their expulsion from Spain and its empire in 1767. The Franciscans took over some former Jesuit missions and continued the expansion of areas incorporated into the empire. Although their primary focus was on religious conversion, missionaries served as \"diplomatic agents, peace emissaries to hostile tribes ... and they were also expected to hold the line against nomadic nonmissionary Indians as well as other European powers.\"<ref>Ramírez, Susan E. \"Missions: Spanish America\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 4, p. 77}}</ref> On the frontier of empire, Indians were seen as ''sin razón'', (\"without reason\"); non-Indian populations were described as ''[[gente de razón]]'' (\"people of reason\"), who could be mixed-race [[casta]]s or black and had greater social mobility in frontier regions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Miranda |first=Gloria E. |title=Racial and Cultural Dimensions of \"Gente de Razón\" Status in Spanish and Mexican California |journal=Southern California Quarterly |volume=70 |number=3 |date=1988 |pages=265–278|doi=10.2307/41171310 |jstor=41171310 }}</ref>

Spain's administration of its colonies in the Americas was divided into the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] 1535 (capital, [[Mexico City]]), and the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] 1542 (capital, [[Lima]]). In the 18th century the additional [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] 1717 (capital, Bogotá), and [[Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata]] 1776 (capital, Buenos Aires) were established from portions of the Viceroyalty of Peru. The change diminished the political and economic power of the viceroyalty and opened formal connections between the mining district of Upper Peru and the port of Buenos Aires.

The system of crown rule evolved from the era of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], which established the [[Council of the Indies]], to the establishment of viceroyalties in Mexico and Peru following their conquests in the Habsburg era, and then into an [[Intendant]] system in the eighteenth century as part of the [[Bourbon Reforms]]. The reform was aimed at increasing crown control over its colonies, raising more revenue, and promoting greater efficiency.

{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence}}
[[File:Spanish America XVIII Century (Most Expansion).png|thumb|Spanish colonialization in the [[Americas]].]]

During the Napoleonic [[Peninsular War]] in Europe between France and Spain, assemblies called ''[[Junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]]'' were established to rule in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]].
The [[Libertadores]] (Spanish and Portuguese for \"Liberators\") were the principal leaders of the Spanish American wars of independence. They were predominantly ''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'' (Americas-born people of European ancestry, mostly Spanish or Portuguese), [[bourgeois]] and influenced by [[liberalism]] and in some cases with military training in the [[Homeland|mother country]].

In 1809 the first declarations of independence from Spanish rule occurred in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. The first two were in the Alto Perú, present-day [[Bolivia]], at Charcas (present day [[Sucre]], May 25), and [[La Paz]] (July 16); and the third in present-day [[Ecuador]] at [[Quito]] (August 10). In 1810 Mexico declared independence, with the [[Mexican War of Independence]] following for over a decade. In 1821 [[Treaty of Córdoba]] established Mexican independence from Spain and concluded the War. The [[Plan of Iguala]] was part of the peace treaty to establish a constitutional foundation for an independent Mexico.

These began a movement for [[Spanish American wars of independence|colonial independence]] that spread to Spain's other colonies in the Americas. The ideas from the [[French Revolution|French]] and the [[American Revolution]] influenced the efforts. All of the colonies, except Cuba and Puerto Rico, attained independence by the 1820s. The [[British Empire]] offered support, wanting to end the Spanish monopoly on trade with its colonies in the Americas.
[[File:El Correo entrando en el puerto de La Habana.jpg|thumb|Havana, [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Spanish Cuba]] in the 19th century]]
In 1898, the [[United States]] achieved victory in the [[Spanish–American War]] with Spain, ending the Spanish colonial era. Spanish possession and rule of its remaining colonies in the Americas ended in that year with its sovereignty transferred to the United States. The United States took occupation of [[Cuba]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. Puerto Rico continues to be a possession of the United States, now officially continues as a [[self-governing]] [[unincorporated territory]].

===Demographic impact===
It has been estimated that over 1.86 million Spaniards emigrated to Latin America in the period between 1492 and 1824, with millions more continuing to immigrate following independence.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=lvvynCzrJOwC&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=emigraci%C3%B3n+espa%C3%B1ola+a+las+indias+cifras#v=onepage&q=emigraci%C3%B3n%20espa%C3%B1ola%20a%20las%20indias%20cifras&f=false | title=La emigración española a América, 1765–1824| isbn=9788474688566| last1=MacIas| first1=Rosario Marquez| last2=MacÍas| first2=Rosario Márquez| year=1995}}</ref>

In Hispaniola, the indigenous Taíno pre-contact population before the arrival of Columbus of several hundred thousand had declined to sixty thousand by 1509. 

The population of the Native American population in [[Mexico]] declined by an estimated 90% (reduced to 1–2.5 million people) by the early 17th century.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In [[Peru]], the indigenous Amerindian pre-contact population of around 6.5 million declined to 1 million by the early 17th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} The overwhelming cause of the decline in both Mexico and Peru was [[infectious diseases]], such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html |title=The Story Of... Smallpox |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2019-03-02}}</ref> although the brutality of the [[Encomienda]] also played a significant part in the population decline.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Of the history of the indigenous population of [[California]], [[Sherburne F. Cook]] (1896–1974) was the most painstakingly careful researcher. From decades of research, he made estimates for the pre-contact population and the history of demographic decline during the Spanish and post-Spanish periods. According to Cook, the indigenous Californian population at first contact, in 1769, was about 310,000 and had dropped to 25,000 by 1910. The vast majority of the decline happened after the Spanish period, during the [[Mexico|Mexican]] and [[United States|US]] periods of Californian history (1821–1910), with the most dramatic collapse (200,000 to 25,000) occurring in the US period (1846–1910).<ref>Baumhoff, Martin A. 1963.

The second factor was disease. ...A third factor, which strongly intensified the effect of the other two, was the social and physical disruption visited upon the Indian. He was driven from his home by the thousands, starved, beaten, raped, and murdered with impunity. He was not only given no assistance in the struggle against foreign diseases, but was prevented from adopting even the most elementary measures to secure his food, clothing, and shelter. The utter devastation caused by the white man was literally incredible, and not until the population figures are examined does the extent of the havoc become evident.\"Cook, Sherburne F. 1976b.

'''Compact disc''' ('''CD''') is a [[Digital media|digital]] [[optical disc]] [[data storage device|data storage]] format that was co-developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] and released in 1982. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings ([[CD-DA]]) but was later adapted for storage of data ([[CD-ROM]]). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage ([[CD-R]]), rewritable media ([[CD-RW]]), Video Compact Disc ([[VCD]]), Super Video Compact Disc ([[SVCD]]), [[Photo CD]], PictureCD, Compact Disc-Interactive ([[CD-i]]), and [[Enhanced Music CD]]. The first commercially available audio [[CD player]], the [[Sony CDP-101]], was released October 1982 in [[Japan]].

Standard CDs have a diameter of {{convert|120|mm}} and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700&nbsp;[[MiB]] of data. The [[Mini CD]] has various diameters ranging from {{convert|60|to|80|mm}}; they are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio, or delivering [[device driver]]s.

At the time of the technology's introduction in 1982, a CD could store much more data than a [[personal computer]] [[hard drive]], which would typically hold 10 MB. By 2010, hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs, while their prices had plummeted to commodity level. In 2004, worldwide sales of audio CDs, CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs. By 2007, 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide.<ref name=\"AutoMR-1\"/>

From the early 2000s, CDs were increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution, with the result that by 2010 the number of audio CDs being sold in the U.S. had dropped about 50 percent from their peak; however, they remained one of the primary distribution methods for the [[music industry]].<ref name=\"AutoMR-2\"/> In 2014, revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|title=IFPI publishes Digital Music Report 2015|url=http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|access-date=1 July 2016|date=14 April 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414194629/http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|archivedate=14 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The compact disc is an evolution of [[LaserDisc]] technology, where a focused [[laser]] beam is used that enables the high information density required for high-quality digital audio signals.
Prototypes were developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] independently in the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of the CD|url=https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/technologies/cd/beginning.html|publisher=Philips Research|access-date=7 June 2014}}</ref> Although originally dismissed by [[Philips Research]] management as a trivial pursuit,<ref name=\"Immink2\"/> the CD became the primary focus for Philips as the [[LaserDisc]] format struggled.<ref name=\"AndItsEnd\">{{Cite journal|last=Straw|first=Will|date=2009|title=The Music CD and Its Ends|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=1|issue=1|pages=79–91|doi=10.2752/175470709787375751|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. After a year of experimentation and discussion, the ''[[Rainbow Books|Red Book]]'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] standard was published in 1980. After their commercial release in 1982, compact discs and their players were extremely popular.

=== Digital audio laser-disc prototypes ===
In 1974, Lou Ottens, director of the audio division of [[Philips]], started a small group with the aim to develop an analog<ref name=\"Immink\"/> optical audio disc with a diameter of {{cvt|20|cm}} and a sound quality superior to that of the vinyl record.<ref>[http://www.laweekly.com/music/why-cds-may-actually-sound-better-than-vinyl-5352162 Why CDs may actually sound better than vinyl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409132701/http://www.laweekly.com/music/why-cds-may-actually-sound-better-than-vinyl-5352162 |date=9 April 2016 }},
Chris Kornelis, 27 January 2015</ref> However, due to the unsatisfactory performance of the analog format, two Philips research engineers recommended a digital format in March 1974.<ref name=\"Immink\"/> In 1977, Philips then established a laboratory with the mission of creating a digital audio disc. The diameter of Philips's prototype compact disc was set at {{cvt|11.5|cm}}, the diagonal of an audio cassette.<ref name=\"Immink\"/><ref name=peek/>

[[Heitaro Nakajima]], who developed an early digital audio recorder within Japan's national public broadcasting organization [[NHK]] in 1970, became general manager of [[Sony]]'s audio department in 1971.

A year later, in September 1977, Sony showed the press a {{cvt|30|cm}} disc that could play 60 minutes of digital audio (44,100&nbsp;Hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution) using [[Run-length limited|MFM]] modulation.<ref name=\"SonyHistorical\"/> In September 1978, the company demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time, 44,056&nbsp;Hz sampling rate, 16-bit linear resolution, and [[Cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding|cross-interleaved]] [[error correction]] code—specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard compact disc format in 1980. Technical details of Sony's digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd [[Audio Engineering Society|AES]] Convention, held on 13–16 March 1979, in [[Brussels]].<ref name=\"SonyHistorical\"/> Sony's AES technical paper was published on 1 March 1979. A week later, on 8 March, Philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called \"Philips Introduce Compact Disc\"<ref name=\"BBC6950933\"/> in [[Eindhoven]], [[Netherlands]].<ref name=\"PhilipsHistorical\"/>

=== Collaboration and standardization ===
[[File:schouhamerimmink.jpg|thumb|upright|Dutch inventor and Philips chief engineer [[Kees Schouhamer Immink]] was part of the team that produced the standard compact disc in 1980]]
Sony executive [[Norio Ohga]], later CEO and chairman of Sony, and [[Heitaro Nakajima]] were convinced of the format's commercial potential and pushed further development despite widespread skepticism.<ref name=\"Ohgaobituary\"/>

As a result, in 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. Led by engineers [[Kees Schouhamer Immink]] and [[Toshitada Doi]], the research pushed forward [[laser]] and [[optical disc]] technology.<ref name=\"BBC6950933\"/> After a year of experimentation and discussion, the task force produced the ''[[Rainbow Books|Red Book]]'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] standard. First published in 1980, the standard was formally adopted by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] as an international standard in 1987, with various amendments becoming part of the standard in 1996.

Philips coined the term ''compact disc'' in line with another audio product, the [[Compact Cassette]],<ref name=peek/> and contributed the general [[manufacturing]] [[Industrial process|process]], based on video LaserDisc technology. Philips also contributed [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] (EFM), while Sony contributed the [[error-correction]] method, [[Cross-Interleaved Reed-Solomon Coding|CIRC]], which offers a certain resilience to defects such as scratches and fingerprints.

The ''Compact Disc Story'',<ref name=\"Immink\"/> told by a former member of the task force, gives background information on the many technical decisions made, including the choice of the sampling frequency, playing time, and disc diameter. The task force consisted of around four to eight persons,<ref name=\"Immink2\"/><ref name=\"Knopper\"/> though according to Philips, the compact disc was \"invented collectively by a large group of people working as a team.\"<ref name=\"PhilDoss\"/>

=== Initial launch and adoption ===
Philips established the Polydor Pressing Operations plant in [[Langenhagen]] near [[Hannover]], [[Germany]], and quickly passed a series of milestones.
* The first ''test pressing'' was of a recording of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[An Alpine Symphony|Eine Alpensinfonie]]'' (''An Alpine Symphony'') played by the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] and conducted by [[Herbert von Karajan]], who had been enlisted as an ambassador for the format in 1979.<ref name=\"Karajan\"/>
* The first ''public demonstration'' was on the [[BBC]] television programme ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' in 1981, when the [[Bee Gees]]' album ''[[Living Eyes (Bee Gees album)|Living Eyes]]'' (1981) was played.<ref name=\"AutoMR-4\"/>
* The first ''commercial'' compact disc was produced on 17 August 1982, a 1979 recording of Chopin waltzes by [[Claudio Arrau]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chonday.com/16551/decbucdkl3/|title=Debut of the Compact Disc|date=2015-08-14|website=www.chonday.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>
* The first 50 titles were ''released'' in Japan on 1 October 1982,<ref name=\"AutoMR-6\"/> the very first of which was a re-release of the [[Billy Joel]] album ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-first-compact-disc-released/|title=How Billy Joel's '52nd Street' Became the First Compact Disc released|first=Jeff|last=Giles|work=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]]|publisher=[[Townsquare Media|Townsquare Media, LLC]]|date=October 1, 2012|accessdate=October 13, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706021629/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-first-compact-disc-released/|archivedate=6 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
* The first CD played on BBC Radio was in October 1982 on BBC Radio Scotland (Jimmy Mack programme, Followed by Ken Bruce and Eddie Mair all BBC Scotland), with the first CD ''played'' on UK independent radio station shortly after (Radio Forth, Jay Crawford Show). The CD was [[Dire Straits]] album ''[[Love Over Gold]]''.<ref>http://www.hificorner.co.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004211808/http://www.hificorner.co.uk/ |date=4 October 2017 }}</ref>
The Japanese launch was followed in March 1983 by the introduction of CD players and discs to Europe<ref>[http://www.newscenter.philips.com/main/standard/about/news/press/20070816_25th_anniversary_cd.wpd \"Philips celebrates 25th anniversay of the Compact Disc\"] {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20150817154431/http://www.newscenter.philips.com/main/standard/about/news/press/20070816_25th_anniversary_cd.wpd |date=17 August 2015 }}, Philips Media Release, 16 August 2007.

The new audio disc was enthusiastically received, especially in the early-adopting [[European classical music|classical music]] and [[audiophile]] communities, and its handling quality received particular praise. As the price of players gradually came down, and with the introduction of the portable [[Discman]] the CD began to gain popularity in the larger popular and rock music markets. With the rise in CD sales, pre-recorded [[cassette tape]] sales began to decline in the late 1980s; CD sales overtook cassette sales in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Record and prerecorded tape stores|publisher=Gale Encyclopedia of American Industries|year=2005|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/record-and-prerecorded-tape-stores|accessdate=20 September 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Harlow |first1=Oliva |title=When Did the CD Replace the Cassette Tape? |url=https://southtree.com/blogs/artifact/when-did-the-cd-replace-the-cassette-tape |website=artifact |accessdate=13 October 2019}}</ref>

The first artist to sell a million copies on CD was [[Dire Straits]], with their 1985 album ''[[Brothers in Arms (album)|Brothers in Arms]]''.<ref name=\"AutoMR-7\"/> One of the first CD markets was devoted to reissuing popular music whose commercial potential was already proven. The first major artist to have their entire catalog converted to CD was [[David Bowie]], whose first fourteen studio albums of (then) sixteen were made available by [[RCA Records]] in February 1985, along with four greatest hits albums; his fifteenth and sixteenth albums had already been issued on CD by [[EMI Records]] in 1983 and 1984, respectively.<ref name=\"AutoMR-8\"/> On February 26, 1987, the first four UK albums by [[the Beatles]] were released in mono on compact disc.<ref name=\"BeatlesCD\"/> In 1988, 400 million CDs were manufactured by 50 pressing plants around the world.<ref name=\"AutoMR-9\"/>

=== Further development and decline ===

The CD was planned to be the successor of the [[vinyl record]] for playing music, rather than primarily as a data storage medium. From its origins as a musical format, CDs have grown to encompass other applications. In 1983, following the CD's introduction, [[Kees Schouhamer Immink|Immink]] and [[Joseph Braat|Braat]] presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd [[Audio Engineering Society|AES]] Convention.<ref>{{Cite journal

In June 1985, the computer-readable [[CD-ROM]] (read-only memory) and, in 1990, [[CD-R]]ecordable were introduced, also developed by both Sony and Philips.<ref name=\"AutoMR-10\"/> Recordable CDs were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without defects introduced in compression used in other digital recording methods. Other newer video formats such as [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are [[backward compatible]] with audio CD.

U.S. CD sales peaked in 2000.<ref name=\"statista\">{{cite web |last1=Richter |first1=Felix |title=The Rise and Fall of the Compact Disc |url=https://www.statista.com/chart/12950/cd-sales-in-the-us/ |website=Statista |accessdate=13 October 2019}}</ref> By the early 2000s, the CD player had largely replaced the [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette]] player as standard equipment in new automobiles, with 2010 being the final model year for any car in the United States to have a factory-equipped cassette player.<ref name=\"nyt20120718\"/> With the increasing popularity of portable digital audio players, such as mobile phones, and solid state music storage, CD players are being phased out of automobiles in favor of [[minijack]] auxiliary inputs, wired connection to USB devices and wireless [[Bluetooth]] connection.<ref>{{citation |title=As Digital Content Moves into Cars, CD Players Begin to Move Out. |work=Journal of Transportation |date=November 8, 2008 |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-189276198.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008194548/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-189276198.html |archivedate=8 October 2016 |df=dmy-all |access-date=24 August 2016 }}</ref>

Meanwhile, with the advent and popularity of [[Digital distribution|Internet-based distribution]] of files in [[Lossy compression|lossily-compressed]] [[audio format]]s such as [[MP3]], sales of CDs began to decline in the 2000s. For example, between 2000 and 2008, despite overall growth in music sales and one anomalous year of increase, major-label CD sales declined overall by 20 percent,<ref name=\"AutoMR-11\"/> although independent and DIY music sales may be tracking better according to figures released 30 March 2009, and CDs still continue to sell greatly.<ref name=\"AutoMR-12\"/> As of 2012, CDs and DVDs made up only 34 percent of music sales in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyotimes.com/buying-cds-continues-to-be-a-tradition-in-japan/|title=Buying CDs continues to be a tradition in Japan - Tokyo Times|date=23 August 2013|access-date=30 December 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220150903/http://www.tokyotimes.com/buying-cds-continues-to-be-a-tradition-in-japan/|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> {{As of|2015|alt=By 2015}}, only 24 percent of music in the United States was purchased on physical media, two thirds of this consisting of CDs;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://riaa.com/media/238E8AC7-3810-A95C-44DC-B6DEB46A3C6E.pdf|title=News and Notes on 2015 Mid-Year RIAA Shipment and Revenue Statistics|last=Friedlander|first=Joshua P.|year=2015|website=|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930135150/http://riaa.com/media/238E8AC7-3810-A95C-44DC-B6DEB46A3C6E.pdf|archive-date=30 September 2015|access-date=}}</ref> however, in the same year in Japan, over 80 percent of music was bought on CDs and other physical formats.<ref>Sisaro, Ben.

A CD is made from {{convert|1.2|mm|adj=on}} thick, [[polycarbonate]] plastic and weighs 15–20 grams.<ref name=\"AutoMR-13\"/>{{better source|date=May 2016}} From the center outward, components are: the center spindle hole (15&nbsp;mm), the first-transition area (clamping ring), the clamping area (stacking ring), the second-transition area (mirror band), the program (data) area, and the rim. The inner program area occupies a radius from 25 to 58&nbsp;mm.

A thin layer of aluminum or, more rarely, [[Gold compact disc|gold]] is applied to the surface, making it reflective. The metal is protected by a film of lacquer normally [[spin coated]] directly on the reflective layer. The label is printed on the lacquer layer, usually by [[screen printing]] or [[offset printing]].

CD data is represented as tiny indentations known as ''pits'', encoded in a spiral track moulded into the top of the polycarbonate layer. The areas between pits are known as ''lands''. Each pit is approximately 100&nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] deep by 500&nbsp;nm wide, and varies from 850&nbsp;nm to 3.5&nbsp;[[Micrometre|µm]] in length.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laesieworks.com/digicom/Storage_CD.html |title=Compact Disc|access-date=6 May 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512100137/http://www.laesieworks.com/digicom/Storage_CD.html |archivedate=12 May 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The distance between the tracks (the ''pitch'') is 1.6&nbsp;µm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.multimediadirector.com/help/technology/downloads/tech_docs/cdintroduction.pdf |title=Introduction to CD and CD-ROM |last=Sharpless |first=Graham |date=July 2003 |publisher=Deluxe Global Media Services Ltd|access-date=3 May 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309135812/http://www.multimediadirector.com/help/technology/downloads/tech_docs/cdintroduction.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"IEC908\">{{cite web |url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/3885 |title=IEC 60908 Audio recording - Compact disc digital audio system |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506194944/https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/3885 |archivedate=6 May 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"IEC10149\">{{cite web |url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/9362 |title=ISO/IEC 10149 Information technology -- Data interchange on read-only 120 mm optical data disks (CD-ROM) |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506194949/https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/9362 |archivedate=6 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

When playing an audio CD, a motor within the CD player spins the disc to a scanning velocity of 1.2–1.4&nbsp;m/s ([[constant linear velocity]], CLV)—equivalent to approximately 500&nbsp;RPM at the inside of the disc, and approximately 200&nbsp;RPM at the outside edge. The track on the CD begins at the inside and spirals outward so a disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback.

[[File:Comparison CD DVD HDDVD BD.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Comparison of various optical storage media<!-- parameters: track pitch (p), pit width (w) and minimum length (l), and laser spot size (⌀) and wavelength (λ). -->]]
The program area is 86.05&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> and the length of the recordable spiral is {{no wrap|86.05 cm<sup>2</sup> / 1.6 µm {{=}}}} {{no wrap|5.38 km.}} With a scanning speed of 1.2&nbsp;m/s, the playing time is 74 minutes, or 650&nbsp;MiB of data on a CD-ROM. A disc with data packed slightly more densely is tolerated by most players (though some old ones fail). Using a linear velocity of 1.2&nbsp;m/s and a narrower track pitch of 1.5&nbsp;µm increases the playing time to 80 minutes, and data capacity to 700&nbsp;MiB.

[[File:CD Pits at 6.25x Magnification.jpg|alt=This is a photomicrograph of the pits at the inner edge of a CD-ROM; 2-second exposure under visible fluorescent light.|thumb|The pits in a CD are 500 [[nanometre|nm]] wide, between 830 nm and 3,000 nm long and 150 nm deep.]]
A CD is read by focusing a 780&nbsp;nm [[wavelength]] ([[near infrared]]) [[semiconductor laser]] through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the reflection intensity change with a [[photodiode]], data is read from the disc. In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the laser is placed on a mobile mechanism within the disc tray of any CD player. This mechanism typically takes the form of a sled that slides across a rail driven by a [[worm gear]], though some CD drives (particularly those manufactured by Philips during the 1980s and early 1990s) use a swing arm similar to that seen on a gramophone. This mechanism allows the laser to read information from the center to the edge of a disc without having to interrupt the spinning of the disc itself.

[[File:CDM210 cd laufwerk.jpg|thumb|Philips CDM210 CD Drive]]

The pits and lands do ''not'' directly represent the 0's and 1's of [[binary data]]. Instead, [[non-return-to-zero, inverted]] encoding is used: a change from either pit to land or land to pit indicates a 1, while no change indicates a series of 0's. There must be at least two, and no more than ten 0's between each 1, which is defined by the length of the pit. This, in turn, is decoded by reversing the [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the [[cross-interleaved Reed–Solomon coding]], finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in the ''[[Compact Disc Digital Audio#Data encoding|Red Book]]'') were originally designed for [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD Digital Audio]], but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as [[CD-ROM]]).

=== Integrity ===
CDs are susceptible to damage during handling and from environmental exposure. Pits are much closer to the label side of a disc, enabling defects and contaminants on the clear side to be out of focus during playback. Consequently, CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the label side of the disc. Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by refilling them with similar refractive plastic or by careful polishing. The edges of CDs are sometimes incompletely sealed, allowing gases and liquids to enter the CD and corrode the metal reflective layer and/or interfere with the focus of the laser on the pits, a condition known as [[disc rot]].<ref name=\"clir\">Council on Library and Information Resources: [http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html Conditions that Affect CDs and DVDs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915012213/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html |date=15 September 2016 }}</ref> The fungus ''[[Geotrichum candidum]]'' has been found—under conditions of high heat and humidity—to consume the polycarbonate plastic and aluminium found in CDs.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|title=Fungus eats CD|year=2001|journal=Nature|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212044729/http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|title=Fungus 'eats' CDs|date=June 2001|publisher=BBC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212220948/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The digital data on a CD begins at the center of the disc and proceeds toward the edge, which allows adaptation to the different size formats available. Standard CDs are available in two sizes. By far, the most common is {{convert|120|mm}} in diameter, with a 74- or 80-minute audio capacity and a 650 or 700&nbsp;MiB (737,280,000-byte) data capacity. Discs are 1.2 mm thick, with a 15 mm center hole. The official Philips history says this capacity was specified by Sony executive [[Norio Ohga]] so as to be able to contain the entirety of [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] on one disc.<ref name=\"Ohgaobituary\"/> This is a myth according to [[Kees Schouhamer Immink|Kees Immink]], as the code format had not yet been decided in December 1979. The adoption of [[Eight-to-fourteen modulation|EFM]] in June 1980 would have allowed a playing time of 97 minutes for 120&nbsp;mm diameter or 74 minutes for a disc as small as 100&nbsp;mm, but instead the information density was lowered by 30 percent to keep the playing time at 74 minutes.<ref name=\"Imminknature\">{{Cite journal

The logical format of an audio CD (officially Compact Disc Digital Audio or CD-DA) is described in a document produced in 1980 by the format's joint creators, Sony and Philips. The document is known colloquially as the ''Red Book'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] after the colour of its cover. The format is a two-channel 16-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] encoding at a [[44.1 kHz|44.1&nbsp;kHz]] [[sampling rate]] per channel. [[Four-channel Compact Disc Digital Audio|Four-channel sound]] was to be an allowable option within the ''Red Book'' format, but has never been implemented. [[Monaural]] audio has no existing standard on a ''Red Book'' CD; thus, mono source material is usually presented as two identical channels in a standard ''Red Book'' stereo track (i.e., [[mono sound#Mirrored mono|mirrored mono]]); an [[MP3 CD]], however, can have audio file formats with mono sound.

[[CD-Text]] is an extension of the ''Red Book'' specification for an audio CD that allows for the storage of additional text information (e.g., album name, song name, artist) on a standards-compliant audio CD. The information is stored either in the [[Optical disc authoring|lead-in area]] of the CD, where there is roughly five kilobytes of space available or in the [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R to W on the disc, which can store about 31 megabytes.

[[Compact Disc + Graphics]] is a special audio compact disc that contains graphics data in addition to the audio data on the disc. The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, it can output a graphics signal (typically, the CD+G player is hooked up to a television set or a computer monitor); these graphics are almost exclusively used to display lyrics on a television set for [[karaoke]] performers to sing along with. The CD+G format takes advantage of the channels R through W. These six bits store the graphics information.

[[CD + Extended Graphics]] (CD+EG, also known as CD+XG) is an improved variant of the [[#CD + Graphics|Compact Disc + Graphics]] (CD+G) format. Like CD+G, CD+EG uses basic CD-ROM features to display text and video information in addition to the music being played. This extra data is stored in [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R-W. Very few, if any, CD+EG discs have been published.

=== Super Audio CD ===
{{Main|Super Audio CD}}
Super Audio CD (SACD) is a high-resolution read-only [[optical disc|optical]] [[audio storage|audio disc]] format that was designed to provide [[high fidelity|higher-fidelity]] digital audio reproduction than the ''Red Book''. Introduced in 1999, it was developed by Sony and Philips, the same companies that created the ''Red Book''. SACD was in a [[format war]] with [[DVD-Audio]], but neither has replaced audio CDs. The SACD standard is referred to the ''Scarlet Book'' standard.

Titles in the SACD format can be issued as hybrid discs; these discs contain the SACD audio stream as well as a standard audio CD layer which is playable in standard CD players, thus making them backward compatible.

=== CD-MIDI ===
CD-[[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] is a format used to store music-performance data, which upon playback is performed by electronic instruments that synthesize the audio. Hence, unlike the original ''Red Book'' CD-DA, these recordings are not digitally sampled audio recordings. The CD-MIDI format is defined as an extension of the original ''Red Book''.

=== CD-ROM ===
{{Main|CD-ROM}}
For the first few years of its existence, the CD was a medium used purely for audio. However, in 1988, the ''Yellow Book'' [[CD-ROM]] standard was established by Sony and Philips, which defined a non-volatile optical data [[computer data storage]] medium using the same physical format as audio compact discs, readable by a computer with a CD-ROM drive.

=== Video CD (VCD) ===
{{Main|Video CD}}
Video CD (VCD, View CD, and Compact Disc digital video) is a standard [[Digital data|digital]] format for storing video media on a CD. VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD players, most modern [[DVD-Video]] players, personal computers, and some video game consoles.

The VCD standard was created in 1993 by Sony, Philips, [[Panasonic|Matsushita]], and [[JVC]] and is referred to as the ''White Book'' standard.

Overall picture quality is intended to be comparable to [[VHS]] video. Poorly compressed VCD video can sometimes be lower quality than VHS video, but VCD exhibits block artifacts rather than analog noise and does not deteriorate further with each use.

352×240 (or [[Source Input Format|SIF]]) resolution was chosen because it is half the vertical and half the horizontal resolution of NTSC video. 352×288 is similarly one-quarter PAL/SECAM resolution. This approximates the (overall) resolution of an analog VHS tape, which, although it has double the number of (vertical) scan lines, has a much lower horizontal resolution.

=== Super Video CD ===
{{Main|Super Video CD}}
Super Video CD (Super Video Compact Disc or SVCD) is a format used for storing video media on standard compact discs. SVCD was intended as a successor to VCD and an alternative to DVD-Video and falls somewhere between both in terms of technical capability and picture quality.

SVCD has two thirds the [[display resolution|resolution]] of DVD, and over 2.7 times the resolution of VCD. One CD-R disc can hold up to 60 minutes of standard-quality SVCD-format video. While no specific limit on SVCD video length is mandated by the specification, one must lower the video bit rate, and therefore quality, to accommodate very long videos. It is usually difficult to fit much more than 100 minutes of video onto one SVCD without incurring significant quality loss, and many hardware players are unable to play video with an instantaneous bit rate lower than 300 to 600 [[kilobit]]s per second.

=== Photo CD ===
{{Main|Photo CD}}
Photo CD is a system designed by [[Kodak]] for digitizing and storing photos on a CD. Launched in 1992, the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high-quality images, scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding. Photo CDs are defined in the ''Beige Book'' and conform to the [[CD-ROM XA]] and CD-i Bridge specifications as well. They are intended to play on CD-i players, Photo CD players and any computer with suitable software (irrespective of [[operating system]]). The images can also be printed out on photographic paper with a special Kodak machine. This format is not to be confused with Kodak [[Picture CD]], which is a consumer product in CD-ROM format.

=== CD-i ===
{{Main|Philips CD-i}}
The Philips ''[[Green Book (CD standard)|Green Book]]'' specifies a standard for interactive multimedia compact discs designed for [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] players (1993). CD-i discs can contain audio tracks that can be played on regular [[CD player]]s, but CD-i discs are not compatible with most [[CD-ROM]] drives and software. The [[CD-i Ready]] specification was later created to improve compatibility with audio CD players, and the [[CD-i Bridge]] specification was added to create CD-i compatible discs that can be accessed by regular CD-ROM drives.

=== CD-i Ready ===
{{Main|CD-i Ready}}
Philips defined a format similar to CD-i called [[CD-i Ready]], which puts CD-i software and data into the [[Pregap#Computer data in pregap|pregap]] of track 1. This format was supposed to be more compatible with older audio CD players.

=== Enhanced Music CD (CD+) ===
{{Main|Blue Book (CD standard)}}
Enhanced Music CD, also known as CD Extra or CD Plus, is a format which combines [[CD-DA|audio tracks]] and [[CD-ROM|data tracks]] on the same disc by putting audio tracks in a first [[Session (CD)|session]] and data in a second session. It was developed by Philips and Sony, and it is defined in the ''[[Blue Book (CD standard)|Blue Book]]''.

=== VinylDisc ===
{{Main|VinylDisc}}
VinylDisc is the hybrid of a standard audio CD and the [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]]. The vinyl layer on the disc's label side can hold approximately three minutes of music.

[[File:Compact disk data layer 2d 3d.PNG|thumb|right|Individual pits are visible on the micrometre scale.]]
In 1995, material costs were 30 cents for the jewel case and 10 to 15 cents for the CD. Wholesale cost of CDs was $0.75 to $1.15, while the typical retail price of a prerecorded music CD was $16.98.<ref name=\"cd costs\">{{cite news |author=Neil Strauss |date=5 July 1995 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/05/arts/pennies-that-add-up-to-16.98-why-cd-s-cost-so-much.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=Pennies That Add Up to $16.98: Why CD's Cost So Much – New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |access-date=25 July 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811000713/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/05/arts/pennies-that-add-up-to-16.98-why-cd-s-cost-so-much.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |archivedate=11 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On average, the store received 35 percent of the retail price, the record company 27 percent, the artist 16 percent, the manufacturer 13 percent, and the distributor 9 percent.<ref name=\"cd costs\"/> When [[8-track tape]]s, [[cassette tape]]s, and CDs were introduced, each was marketed at a higher price than the format they succeeded, even though the cost to produce the media was reduced. This was done because the apparent value increased. This continued from [[vinyl record|vinyl]] to CDs but was broken when [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] marketed MP3s for $0.99, and albums for $9.99. The incremental cost, though, to produce an MP3 is negligible.<ref>{{cite news |author=Amy HarmonPublished: 12 October 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/arts/music-what-price-music.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=MUSIC; What Price Music? |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=12 October 2003 |access-date=25 July 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512175059/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/arts/music-what-price-music.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |archivedate=12 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

== Writable compact discs ==

=== Recordable CD ===
[[File:Maxell CD-R 700MB 40x 20040321.jpg|thumb|700&nbsp;[[MiB]] CD-R next to a [[mechanical pencil]] for scale]]
{{Main|CD-R}}
Recordable Compact Discs, [[CD-R]]s, are injection-molded with a \"blank\" data spiral. A photosensitive dye is then applied, after which the discs are metalized and lacquer-coated. The write laser of the [[CD recorder]] changes the color of the dye to allow the read laser of a standard [[CD player]] to see the data, just as it would with a standard stamped disc. The resulting discs can be read by most CD-ROM drives and played in most audio CD players. CD-Rs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.

CD-R recordings are designed to be permanent. Over time, the dye's physical characteristics may change causing read errors and data loss until the reading device cannot recover with error correction methods. The design life is from 20 to 100 years, depending on the quality of the discs, the quality of the writing drive, and storage conditions. However, testing has demonstrated such degradation of some discs in as little as 18 months under normal storage conditions.<ref name=\"AutoMR-14\"/><ref name=\"AutoMR-15\"/> This failure is known as [[disc rot]], for which there are several, mostly environmental, reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html|title=5. Conditions That Affect CDs and DVDs — Council on Library and Information Resources|website=www.clir.org|access-date=2016-07-05|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915012213/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html|archivedate=15 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The recordable audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder. These consumer audio CD recorders use SCMS ([[Serial Copy Management System]]), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the AHRA ([[Audio Home Recording Act]]). The Recordable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-R due to lower production volume and a 3 percent [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.<ref name=\"McFadden\"/>

High-capacity recordable CD is a higher-density recording format that can hold 20% more data than of conventional discs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.osta.org/technology/cdqa7.htm |title=Understanding CD-R & CD-RW |publisher=Osta.org |access-date=25 July 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801123221/http://www.osta.org/technology/cdqa7.htm |archivedate=1 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The higher capacity is incompatible with some recorders and recording software.<ref name=\"cdrfaq\">{{cite web

=== ReWritable CD ===
{{Main|CD-RW}}
[[CD-RW]] is a re-recordable medium that uses a metallic alloy instead of a dye. The write laser, in this case, is used to heat and alter the properties (amorphous vs. crystalline) of the alloy, and hence change its reflectivity. A CD-RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD-R, and so many earlier CD audio players ''cannot'' read CD-RW discs, although ''most'' later CD audio players and stand-alone [[DVD]] players can. CD-RWs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.

The ReWritable Audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder, which will not (without modification) accept standard CD-RW discs. These consumer audio CD recorders use the [[Serial Copy Management System]] (SCMS), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the United States' [[Audio Home Recording Act]] (AHRA). The ReWritable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-RW due to (a) lower volume and (b) a 3 percent [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.<ref name=\"McFadden\"/>

== Copy protection ==
{{Main|Compact Disc and DVD copy protection}}
The ''Red Book'' audio specification, except for a simple \"anti-copy\" statement in the subcode, does not include any [[copy protection]] mechanism. Known at least as early as 2001,<ref name=\"BadCDs\"/> attempts were made by record companies to market \"copy-protected\" non-standard compact discs, which cannot be [[Ripping|ripped]], or copied, to hard drives or easily converted to other formats (like [[FLAC]], [[MP3]] or [[Vorbis]]). One major drawback to these copy-protected discs is that most will not play on either computer CD-ROM drives or some standalone CD players that use CD-ROM mechanisms. Philips has stated that such discs are not permitted to bear the trademarked ''Compact Disc Digital Audio'' logo because they violate the ''Red Book'' specifications. Numerous copy-protection systems have been countered by readily available, often free, software, or even by simply turning off automatic [[AutoPlay]] to prevent the running of the DRM [[executable]] program.
==Other uses==

'''Compact disc''' ('''CD''') is a [[Digital media|digital]] [[optical disc]] [[data storage device|data storage]] format that was co-developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] and released in 1982. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings ([[CD-DA]]) but was later adapted for storage of data ([[CD-ROM]]). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage ([[CD-R]]), rewritable media ([[CD-RW]]), Video Compact Disc ([[VCD]]), Super Video Compact Disc ([[SVCD]]), [[Photo CD]], PictureCD, Compact Disc-Interactive ([[CD-i]]), and [[Enhanced Music CD]]. The first commercially available audio [[CD player]], the [[Sony CDP-101]], was released October 1982 in [[Japan]].

Standard CDs have a diameter of {{convert|120|mm}} and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700&nbsp;[[MiB]] of data. The [[Mini CD]] has various diameters ranging from {{convert|60|to|80|mm}}; they are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio, or delivering [[device driver]]s.

At the time of the technology's introduction in 1982, a CD could store much more data than a [[personal computer]] [[hard drive]], which would typically hold 10 MB. By 2010, hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs, while their prices had plummeted to commodity level. In 2004, worldwide sales of audio CDs, CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs. By 2007, 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide.<ref name=\"AutoMR-1\"/>

From the early 2000s, CDs were increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution, with the result that by 2010 the number of audio CDs being sold in the U.S. had dropped about 50 percent from their peak; however, they remained one of the primary distribution methods for the [[music industry]].<ref name=\"AutoMR-2\"/> In 2014, revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|title=IFPI publishes Digital Music Report 2015|url=http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|access-date=1 July 2016|date=14 April 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414194629/http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|archivedate=14 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The compact disc is an evolution of [[LaserDisc]] technology, where a focused [[laser]] beam is used that enables the high information density required for high-quality digital audio signals.
Prototypes were developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] independently in the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of the CD|url=https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/technologies/cd/beginning.html|publisher=Philips Research|access-date=7 June 2014}}</ref> Although originally dismissed by [[Philips Research]] management as a trivial pursuit,<ref name=\"Immink2\"/> the CD became the primary focus for Philips as the [[LaserDisc]] format struggled.<ref name=\"AndItsEnd\">{{Cite journal|last=Straw|first=Will|date=2009|title=The Music CD and Its Ends|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=1|issue=1|pages=79–91|doi=10.2752/175470709787375751|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. After a year of experimentation and discussion, the ''[[Rainbow Books|Red Book]]'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] standard was published in 1980. After their commercial release in 1982, compact discs and their players were extremely popular. Despite costing up to $1,000, over 400,000 CD players were sold in the United States between 1983 and 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/1985/05/compact-discs-sound-of-the-future/|title=Compact Discs: Sound of the Future|first=Edward|last=Rasen|work=Spin|access-date=9 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216064105/http://www.spin.com/1985/05/compact-discs-sound-of-the-future/|archivedate=16 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> By 1988, CD sales in the United States surpassed those of vinyl LPs, and by 1992 CD sales surpassed those of prerecorded music cassette tapes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=CD Unit Sales Pass Cassettes, Majors Say|last=Billboard|first=|date=March 1992|work=Billboard|access-date=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Have Compact Disks Become Too Much of a Good Thing?|last=Kozinn|first=Allan|date=December 1988|work=The New York Times|access-date=|via=}}</ref> The success of the compact disc has been credited to the cooperation between [[Philips]] and [[Sony]], which together agreed upon and developed compatible hardware.

=== Digital audio laser-disc prototypes ===
In 1974, Lou Ottens, director of the audio division of [[Philips]], started a small group with the aim to develop an analog<ref name=\"Immink\"/> optical audio disc with a diameter of {{cvt|20|cm}} and a sound quality superior to that of the vinyl record.<ref>[http://www.laweekly.com/music/why-cds-may-actually-sound-better-than-vinyl-5352162 Why CDs may actually sound better than vinyl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409132701/http://www.laweekly.com/music/why-cds-may-actually-sound-better-than-vinyl-5352162 |date=9 April 2016 }},
Chris Kornelis, 27 January 2015</ref> However, due to the unsatisfactory performance of the analog format, two Philips research engineers recommended a digital format in March 1974.<ref name=\"Immink\"/> In 1977, Philips then established a laboratory with the mission of creating a digital audio disc. The diameter of Philips's prototype compact disc was set at {{cvt|11.5|cm}}, the diagonal of an audio cassette.<ref name=\"Immink\"/><ref name=peek/>

[[Heitaro Nakajima]], who developed an early digital audio recorder within Japan's national public broadcasting organization [[NHK]] in 1970, became general manager of [[Sony]]'s audio department in 1971. His team developed a digital [[PCM adaptor]] audio tape recorder using a [[Betamax]] video recorder in 1973. After this, in 1974 the leap to storing digital audio on an optical disc was easily made.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kw0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68 | title=Heitaro Nakajima | work=Billboard | date=8 January 2000 | access-date=4 November 2014 | author=McClure, Steve | pages=68 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319065246/http://books.google.com/books?id=kw0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68 | archivedate=19 March 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Sony]] first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in September 1976. A year later, in September 1977, Sony showed the press a {{cvt|30|cm}} disc that could play 60 minutes of digital audio (44,100&nbsp;Hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution) using [[Run-length limited|MFM]] modulation.<ref name=\"SonyHistorical\"/> In September 1978, the company demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time, 44,056&nbsp;Hz sampling rate, 16-bit linear resolution, and [[Cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding|cross-interleaved]] [[error correction]] code—specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard compact disc format in 1980. Technical details of Sony's digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd [[Audio Engineering Society|AES]] Convention, held on 13–16 March 1979, in [[Brussels]].<ref name=\"SonyHistorical\"/> Sony's AES technical paper was published on 1 March 1979. A week later, on 8 March, Philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called \"Philips Introduce Compact Disc\"<ref name=\"BBC6950933\"/> in [[Eindhoven]], [[Netherlands]].<ref name=\"PhilipsHistorical\"/>

=== Collaboration and standardization ===
[[File:schouhamerimmink.jpg|thumb|upright|Dutch inventor and Philips chief engineer [[Kees Schouhamer Immink]] was part of the team that produced the standard compact disc in 1980]]
Sony executive [[Norio Ohga]], later CEO and chairman of Sony, and [[Heitaro Nakajima]] were convinced of the format's commercial potential and pushed further development despite widespread skepticism.<ref name=\"Ohgaobituary\"/>

As a result, in 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. Led by engineers [[Kees Schouhamer Immink]] and [[Toshitada Doi]], the research pushed forward [[laser]] and [[optical disc]] technology.<ref name=\"BBC6950933\"/> After a year of experimentation and discussion, the task force produced the ''[[Rainbow Books|Red Book]]'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] standard. First published in 1980, the standard was formally adopted by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] as an international standard in 1987, with various amendments becoming part of the standard in 1996.

Philips coined the term ''compact disc'' in line with another audio product, the [[Compact Cassette]],<ref name=peek/> and contributed the general [[manufacturing]] [[Industrial process|process]], based on video LaserDisc technology. Philips also contributed [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] (EFM), while Sony contributed the [[error-correction]] method, [[Cross-Interleaved Reed-Solomon Coding|CIRC]], which offers a certain resilience to defects such as scratches and fingerprints.

The ''Compact Disc Story'',<ref name=\"Immink\"/> told by a former member of the task force, gives background information on the many technical decisions made, including the choice of the sampling frequency, playing time, and disc diameter. The task force consisted of around four to eight persons,<ref name=\"Immink2\"/><ref name=\"Knopper\"/> though according to Philips, the compact disc was \"invented collectively by a large group of people working as a team.\"<ref name=\"PhilDoss\"/>

=== Initial launch and adoption ===
Philips established the Polydor Pressing Operations plant in [[Langenhagen]] near [[Hannover]], [[Germany]], and quickly passed a series of milestones.
* The first ''test pressing'' was of a recording of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[An Alpine Symphony|Eine Alpensinfonie]]'' (''An Alpine Symphony'') played by the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] and conducted by [[Herbert von Karajan]], who had been enlisted as an ambassador for the format in 1979.<ref name=\"Karajan\"/>
* The first ''public demonstration'' was on the [[BBC]] television programme ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' in 1981, when the [[Bee Gees]]' album ''[[Living Eyes (Bee Gees album)|Living Eyes]]'' (1981) was played.<ref name=\"AutoMR-4\"/>
* The first ''commercial'' compact disc was produced on 17 August 1982, a 1979 recording of Chopin waltzes by [[Claudio Arrau]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chonday.com/16551/decbucdkl3/|title=Debut of the Compact Disc|date=2015-08-14|website=www.chonday.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>
* The first 50 titles were ''released'' in Japan on 1 October 1982,<ref name=\"AutoMR-6\"/> the very first of which was a re-release of the [[Billy Joel]] album ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-first-compact-disc-released/|title=How Billy Joel's '52nd Street' Became the First Compact Disc released|first=Jeff|last=Giles|work=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]]|publisher=[[Townsquare Media|Townsquare Media, LLC]]|date=October 1, 2012|accessdate=October 13, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706021629/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-first-compact-disc-released/|archivedate=6 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
* The first CD played on BBC Radio was in October 1982 on BBC Radio Scotland (Jimmy Mack programme, Followed by Ken Bruce and Eddie Mair all BBC Scotland), with the first CD ''played'' on UK independent radio station shortly after (Radio Forth, Jay Crawford Show). The CD was [[Dire Straits]] album ''[[Love Over Gold]]''.<ref>http://www.hificorner.co.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004211808/http://www.hificorner.co.uk/ |date=4 October 2017 }}</ref>
The Japanese launch was followed in March 1983 by the introduction of CD players and discs to Europe<ref>[http://www.newscenter.philips.com/main/standard/about/news/press/20070816_25th_anniversary_cd.wpd \"Philips celebrates 25th anniversay of the Compact Disc\"] {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20150817154431/http://www.newscenter.philips.com/main/standard/about/news/press/20070816_25th_anniversary_cd.wpd |date=17 August 2015 }}, Philips Media Release, 16 August 2007.

The new audio disc was enthusiastically received, especially in the early-adopting [[European classical music|classical music]] and [[audiophile]] communities, and its handling quality received particular praise. As the price of players gradually came down, and with the introduction of the portable [[Discman]] the CD began to gain popularity in the larger popular and rock music markets. With the rise in CD sales, pre-recorded [[cassette tape]] sales began to decline in the late 1980s; CD sales overtook cassette sales in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Record and prerecorded tape stores|publisher=Gale Encyclopedia of American Industries|year=2005|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/record-and-prerecorded-tape-stores|accessdate=20 September 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Harlow |first1=Oliva |title=When Did the CD Replace the Cassette Tape? |url=https://southtree.com/blogs/artifact/when-did-the-cd-replace-the-cassette-tape |website=artifact |accessdate=13 October 2019}}</ref>

The first artist to sell a million copies on CD was [[Dire Straits]], with their 1985 album ''[[Brothers in Arms (album)|Brothers in Arms]]''.<ref name=\"AutoMR-7\"/> One of the first CD markets was devoted to reissuing popular music whose commercial potential was already proven. The first major artist to have their entire catalog converted to CD was [[David Bowie]], whose first fourteen studio albums of (then) sixteen were made available by [[RCA Records]] in February 1985, along with four greatest hits albums; his fifteenth and sixteenth albums had already been issued on CD by [[EMI Records]] in 1983 and 1984, respectively.<ref name=\"AutoMR-8\"/> On February 26, 1987, the first four UK albums by [[the Beatles]] were released in mono on compact disc.<ref name=\"BeatlesCD\"/> In 1988, 400 million CDs were manufactured by 50 pressing plants around the world.<ref name=\"AutoMR-9\"/>

=== Further development and decline ===

The CD was planned to be the successor of the [[vinyl record]] for playing music, rather than primarily as a data storage medium. From its origins as a musical format, CDs have grown to encompass other applications. In 1983, following the CD's introduction, [[Kees Schouhamer Immink|Immink]] and [[Joseph Braat|Braat]] presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd [[Audio Engineering Society|AES]] Convention.<ref>{{Cite journal

In June 1985, the computer-readable [[CD-ROM]] (read-only memory) and, in 1990, [[CD-R]]ecordable were introduced, also developed by both Sony and Philips.<ref name=\"AutoMR-10\"/> Recordable CDs were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without defects introduced in compression used in other digital recording methods. Other newer video formats such as [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are [[backward compatible]] with audio CD.

A CD is made from {{convert|1.2|mm|adj=on}} thick, [[polycarbonate]] plastic and weighs 15–20 grams.<ref name=\"AutoMR-13\"/>{{better source|date=May 2016}} From the center outward, components are: the center spindle hole (15&nbsp;mm), the first-transition area (clamping ring), the clamping area (stacking ring), the second-transition area (mirror band), the program (data) area, and the rim. The inner program area occupies a radius from 25 to 58&nbsp;mm.

A thin layer of aluminum or, more rarely, [[Gold compact disc|gold]] is applied to the surface, making it reflective. The metal is protected by a film of lacquer normally [[spin coated]] directly on the reflective layer. The label is printed on the lacquer layer, usually by [[screen printing]] or [[offset printing]].

CD data is represented as tiny indentations known as ''pits'', encoded in a spiral track moulded into the top of the polycarbonate layer. The areas between pits are known as ''lands''. Each pit is approximately 100&nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] deep by 500&nbsp;nm wide, and varies from 850&nbsp;nm to 3.5&nbsp;[[Micrometre|µm]] in length.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laesieworks.com/digicom/Storage_CD.html |title=Compact Disc|access-date=6 May 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512100137/http://www.laesieworks.com/digicom/Storage_CD.html |archivedate=12 May 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The distance between the tracks (the ''pitch'') is 1.6&nbsp;µm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.multimediadirector.com/help/technology/downloads/tech_docs/cdintroduction.pdf |title=Introduction to CD and CD-ROM |last=Sharpless |first=Graham |date=July 2003 |publisher=Deluxe Global Media Services Ltd|access-date=3 May 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309135812/http://www.multimediadirector.com/help/technology/downloads/tech_docs/cdintroduction.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"IEC908\">{{cite web |url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/3885 |title=IEC 60908 Audio recording - Compact disc digital audio system |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506194944/https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/3885 |archivedate=6 May 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"IEC10149\">{{cite web |url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/9362 |title=ISO/IEC 10149 Information technology -- Data interchange on read-only 120 mm optical data disks (CD-ROM) |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506194949/https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/9362 |archivedate=6 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

When playing an audio CD, a motor within the CD player spins the disc to a scanning velocity of 1.2–1.4&nbsp;m/s ([[constant linear velocity]], CLV)—equivalent to approximately 500&nbsp;RPM at the inside of the disc, and approximately 200&nbsp;RPM at the outside edge. The track on the CD begins at the inside and spirals outward so a disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback.

[[File:Comparison CD DVD HDDVD BD.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Comparison of various optical storage media<!-- parameters: track pitch (p), pit width (w) and minimum length (l), and laser spot size (⌀) and wavelength (λ). -->]]
The program area is 86.05&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> and the length of the recordable spiral is {{no wrap|86.05 cm<sup>2</sup> / 1.6 µm {{=}}}} {{no wrap|5.38 km.}} With a scanning speed of 1.2&nbsp;m/s, the playing time is 74 minutes, or 650&nbsp;MiB of data on a CD-ROM. A disc with data packed slightly more densely is tolerated by most players (though some old ones fail). Using a linear velocity of 1.2&nbsp;m/s and a narrower track pitch of 1.5&nbsp;µm increases the playing time to 80 minutes, and data capacity to 700&nbsp;MiB.

[[File:CD Pits at 6.25x Magnification.jpg|alt=This is a photomicrograph of the pits at the inner edge of a CD-ROM; 2-second exposure under visible fluorescent light.|thumb|The pits in a CD are 500 [[nanometre|nm]] wide, between 830 nm and 3,000 nm long and 150 nm deep.]]
A CD is read by focusing a 780&nbsp;nm [[wavelength]] ([[near infrared]]) [[semiconductor laser]] through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the reflection intensity change with a [[photodiode]], data is read from the disc. In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the laser is placed on a mobile mechanism within the disc tray of any CD player. This mechanism typically takes the form of a sled that slides across a rail driven by a [[worm gear]], though some CD drives (particularly those manufactured by Philips during the 1980s and early 1990s) use a swing arm similar to that seen on a gramophone. This mechanism allows the laser to read information from the center to the edge of a disc without having to interrupt the spinning of the disc itself.

[[File:CDM210 cd laufwerk.jpg|thumb|Philips CDM210 CD Drive]]

The pits and lands do ''not'' directly represent the 0's and 1's of [[binary data]]. Instead, [[non-return-to-zero, inverted]] encoding is used: a change from either pit to land or land to pit indicates a 1, while no change indicates a series of 0's. There must be at least two, and no more than ten 0's between each 1, which is defined by the length of the pit. This, in turn, is decoded by reversing the [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the [[cross-interleaved Reed–Solomon coding]], finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in the ''[[Compact Disc Digital Audio#Data encoding|Red Book]]'') were originally designed for [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD Digital Audio]], but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as [[CD-ROM]]).

=== Integrity ===
CDs are susceptible to damage during handling and from environmental exposure. Pits are much closer to the label side of a disc, enabling defects and contaminants on the clear side to be out of focus during playback. Consequently, CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the label side of the disc. Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by refilling them with similar refractive plastic or by careful polishing. The edges of CDs are sometimes incompletely sealed, allowing gases and liquids to enter the CD and corrode the metal reflective layer and/or interfere with the focus of the laser on the pits, a condition known as [[disc rot]].<ref name=\"clir\">Council on Library and Information Resources: [http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html Conditions that Affect CDs and DVDs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915012213/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html |date=15 September 2016 }}</ref> The fungus ''[[Geotrichum candidum]]'' has been found—under conditions of high heat and humidity—to consume the polycarbonate plastic and aluminium found in CDs.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|title=Fungus eats CD|year=2001|journal=Nature|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212044729/http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|title=Fungus 'eats' CDs|date=June 2001|publisher=BBC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212220948/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The digital data on a CD begins at the center of the disc and proceeds toward the edge, which allows adaptation to the different size formats available. Standard CDs are available in two sizes. By far, the most common is {{convert|120|mm}} in diameter, with a 74- or 80-minute audio capacity and a 650 or 700&nbsp;MiB (737,280,000-byte) data capacity. Discs are 1.2 mm thick, with a 15 mm center hole. The official Philips history says this capacity was specified by Sony executive [[Norio Ohga]] so as to be able to contain the entirety of [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] on one disc.<ref name=\"Ohgaobituary\"/> This is a myth according to [[Kees Schouhamer Immink|Kees Immink]], as the code format had not yet been decided in December 1979. The adoption of [[Eight-to-fourteen modulation|EFM]] in June 1980 would have allowed a playing time of 97 minutes for 120&nbsp;mm diameter or 74 minutes for a disc as small as 100&nbsp;mm, but instead the information density was lowered by 30 percent to keep the playing time at 74 minutes.<ref name=\"Imminknature\">{{Cite journal

== Logical format ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}

=== Audio CD ===
{{Main|Compact Disc Digital Audio}}
The logical format of an audio CD (officially Compact Disc Digital Audio or CD-DA) is described in a document produced in 1980 by the format's joint creators, Sony and Philips. The document is known colloquially as the ''Red Book'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] after the colour of its cover. The format is a two-channel 16-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] encoding at a [[44.1 kHz|44.1&nbsp;kHz]] [[sampling rate]] per channel. [[Four-channel Compact Disc Digital Audio|Four-channel sound]] was to be an allowable option within the ''Red Book'' format, but has never been implemented. [[Monaural]] audio has no existing standard on a ''Red Book'' CD; thus, mono source material is usually presented as two identical channels in a standard ''Red Book'' stereo track (i.e., [[mono sound#Mirrored mono|mirrored mono]]); an [[MP3 CD]], however, can have audio file formats with mono sound.

[[CD-Text]] is an extension of the ''Red Book'' specification for an audio CD that allows for the storage of additional text information (e.g., album name, song name, artist) on a standards-compliant audio CD. The information is stored either in the [[Optical disc authoring|lead-in area]] of the CD, where there is roughly five kilobytes of space available or in the [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R to W on the disc, which can store about 31 megabytes.

[[Compact Disc + Graphics]] is a special audio compact disc that contains graphics data in addition to the audio data on the disc. The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, it can output a graphics signal (typically, the CD+G player is hooked up to a television set or a computer monitor); these graphics are almost exclusively used to display lyrics on a television set for [[karaoke]] performers to sing along with. The CD+G format takes advantage of the channels R through W. These six bits store the graphics information.

[[CD + Extended Graphics]] (CD+EG, also known as CD+XG) is an improved variant of the [[#CD + Graphics|Compact Disc + Graphics]] (CD+G) format. Like CD+G, CD+EG uses basic CD-ROM features to display text and video information in addition to the music being played. This extra data is stored in [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R-W. Very few, if any, CD+EG discs have been published.

=== Super Audio CD ===
{{Main|Super Audio CD}}
Super Audio CD (SACD) is a high-resolution read-only [[optical disc|optical]] [[audio storage|audio disc]] format that was designed to provide [[high fidelity|higher-fidelity]] digital audio reproduction than the ''Red Book''. Introduced in 1999, it was developed by Sony and Philips, the same companies that created the ''Red Book''. SACD was in a [[format war]] with [[DVD-Audio]], but neither has replaced audio CDs. The SACD standard is referred to the ''Scarlet Book'' standard.

Titles in the SACD format can be issued as hybrid discs; these discs contain the SACD audio stream as well as a standard audio CD layer which is playable in standard CD players, thus making them backward compatible.

=== CD-MIDI ===
CD-[[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] is a format used to store music-performance data, which upon playback is performed by electronic instruments that synthesize the audio. Hence, unlike the original ''Red Book'' CD-DA, these recordings are not digitally sampled audio recordings. The CD-MIDI format is defined as an extension of the original ''Red Book''.

=== CD-ROM ===
{{Main|CD-ROM}}
For the first few years of its existence, the CD was a medium used purely for audio. However, in 1988, the ''Yellow Book'' [[CD-ROM]] standard was established by Sony and Philips, which defined a non-volatile optical data [[computer data storage]] medium using the same physical format as audio compact discs, readable by a computer with a CD-ROM drive.

=== Video CD (VCD) ===
{{Main|Video CD}}
Video CD (VCD, View CD, and Compact Disc digital video) is a standard [[Digital data|digital]] format for storing video media on a CD. VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD players, most modern [[DVD-Video]] players, personal computers, and some video game consoles.

The VCD standard was created in 1993 by Sony, Philips, [[Panasonic|Matsushita]], and [[JVC]] and is referred to as the ''White Book'' standard.

Overall picture quality is intended to be comparable to [[VHS]] video. Poorly compressed VCD video can sometimes be lower quality than VHS video, but VCD exhibits block artifacts rather than analog noise and does not deteriorate further with each use.

352×240 (or [[Source Input Format|SIF]]) resolution was chosen because it is half the vertical and half the horizontal resolution of NTSC video. 352×288 is similarly one-quarter PAL/SECAM resolution. This approximates the (overall) resolution of an analog VHS tape, which, although it has double the number of (vertical) scan lines, has a much lower horizontal resolution.

=== Super Video CD ===
{{Main|Super Video CD}}
Super Video CD (Super Video Compact Disc or SVCD) is a format used for storing video media on standard compact discs. SVCD was intended as a successor to VCD and an alternative to DVD-Video and falls somewhere between both in terms of technical capability and picture quality.

SVCD has two thirds the [[display resolution|resolution]] of DVD, and over 2.7 times the resolution of VCD. One CD-R disc can hold up to 60 minutes of standard-quality SVCD-format video. While no specific limit on SVCD video length is mandated by the specification, one must lower the video bit rate, and therefore quality, to accommodate very long videos. It is usually difficult to fit much more than 100 minutes of video onto one SVCD without incurring significant quality loss, and many hardware players are unable to play video with an instantaneous bit rate lower than 300 to 600 [[kilobit]]s per second.

=== Photo CD ===
{{Main|Photo CD}}
Photo CD is a system designed by [[Kodak]] for digitizing and storing photos on a CD. Launched in 1992, the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high-quality images, scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding. Photo CDs are defined in the ''Beige Book'' and conform to the [[CD-ROM XA]] and CD-i Bridge specifications as well. They are intended to play on CD-i players, Photo CD players and any computer with suitable software (irrespective of [[operating system]]). The images can also be printed out on photographic paper with a special Kodak machine. This format is not to be confused with Kodak [[Picture CD]], which is a consumer product in CD-ROM format.

=== CD-i ===
{{Main|Philips CD-i}}
The Philips ''[[Green Book (CD standard)|Green Book]]'' specifies a standard for interactive multimedia compact discs designed for [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] players (1993). CD-i discs can contain audio tracks that can be played on regular [[CD player]]s, but CD-i discs are not compatible with most [[CD-ROM]] drives and software. The [[CD-i Ready]] specification was later created to improve compatibility with audio CD players, and the [[CD-i Bridge]] specification was added to create CD-i compatible discs that can be accessed by regular CD-ROM drives.

=== CD-i Ready ===
{{Main|CD-i Ready}}
Philips defined a format similar to CD-i called [[CD-i Ready]], which puts CD-i software and data into the [[Pregap#Computer data in pregap|pregap]] of track 1. This format was supposed to be more compatible with older audio CD players.

=== Enhanced Music CD (CD+) ===
{{Main|Blue Book (CD standard)}}
Enhanced Music CD, also known as CD Extra or CD Plus, is a format which combines [[CD-DA|audio tracks]] and [[CD-ROM|data tracks]] on the same disc by putting audio tracks in a first [[Session (CD)|session]] and data in a second session. It was developed by Philips and Sony, and it is defined in the ''[[Blue Book (CD standard)|Blue Book]]''.

=== VinylDisc ===
{{Main|VinylDisc}}
VinylDisc is the hybrid of a standard audio CD and the [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]]. The vinyl layer on the disc's label side can hold approximately three minutes of music.

Recordable Compact Discs, [[CD-R]]s, are injection-molded with a \"blank\" data spiral. A photosensitive dye is then applied, after which the discs are metalized and lacquer-coated. The write laser of the [[CD recorder]] changes the color of the dye to allow the read laser of a standard [[CD player]] to see the data, just as it would with a standard stamped disc. The resulting discs can be read by most CD-ROM drives and played in most audio CD players. CD-Rs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.

CD-R recordings are designed to be permanent. Over time, the dye's physical characteristics may change causing read errors and data loss until the reading device cannot recover with error correction methods. The design life is from 20 to 100 years, depending on the quality of the discs, the quality of the writing drive, and storage conditions. However, testing has demonstrated such degradation of some discs in as little as 18 months under normal storage conditions.<ref name=\"AutoMR-14\"/><ref name=\"AutoMR-15\"/> This failure is known as [[disc rot]], for which there are several, mostly environmental, reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html|title=5. Conditions That Affect CDs and DVDs — Council on Library and Information Resources|website=www.clir.org|access-date=2016-07-05|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915012213/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html|archivedate=15 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The recordable audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder. These consumer audio CD recorders use SCMS ([[Serial Copy Management System]]), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the AHRA ([[Audio Home Recording Act]]). The Recordable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-R due to lower production volume and a 3 percent [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.<ref name=\"McFadden\"/>

High-capacity recordable CD is a higher-density recording format that can hold 20% more data than of conventional discs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.osta.org/technology/cdqa7.htm |title=Understanding CD-R & CD-RW |publisher=Osta.org |access-date=25 July 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801123221/http://www.osta.org/technology/cdqa7.htm |archivedate=1 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The higher capacity is incompatible with some recorders and recording software.<ref name=\"cdrfaq\">{{cite web

=== ReWritable CD ===
{{Main|CD-RW}}
[[CD-RW]] is a re-recordable medium that uses a metallic alloy instead of a dye. The write laser, in this case, is used to heat and alter the properties (amorphous vs. crystalline) of the alloy, and hence change its reflectivity. A CD-RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD-R, and so many earlier CD audio players ''cannot'' read CD-RW discs, although ''most'' later CD audio players and stand-alone [[DVD]] players can. CD-RWs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.

The ReWritable Audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder, which will not (without modification) accept standard CD-RW discs. These consumer audio CD recorders use the [[Serial Copy Management System]] (SCMS), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the United States' [[Audio Home Recording Act]] (AHRA). The ReWritable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-RW due to (a) lower volume and (b) a 3 percent [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.<ref name=\"McFadden\"/>

== Copy protection ==
{{Main|Compact Disc and DVD copy protection}}
The ''Red Book'' audio specification, except for a simple \"anti-copy\" statement in the subcode, does not include any [[copy protection]] mechanism. Known at least as early as 2001,<ref name=\"BadCDs\"/> attempts were made by record companies to market \"copy-protected\" non-standard compact discs, which cannot be [[Ripping|ripped]], or copied, to hard drives or easily converted to other formats (like [[FLAC]], [[MP3]] or [[Vorbis]]). One major drawback to these copy-protected discs is that most will not play on either computer CD-ROM drives or some standalone CD players that use CD-ROM mechanisms. Philips has stated that such discs are not permitted to bear the trademarked ''Compact Disc Digital Audio'' logo because they violate the ''Red Book'' specifications. Numerous copy-protection systems have been countered by readily available, often free, software, or even by simply turning off automatic [[AutoPlay]] to prevent the running of the DRM [[executable]] program.
==Other uses==

'''Oliver Stanley Murs'''<ref>[http://xfactor.itv.com/2009/episodes/video/item_201004.htm Olly's diary – Week 10 – Part 1] ITV – X Factor, 9 December 2009</ref> (born 14 May 1984) is an English singer, songwriter, television presenter and voice actor. He first came to national attention for coming second in the [[The X Factor (UK series 6)|sixth series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in 2009. He is currently signed to [[RCA Records]] and [[Sony Music UK]] in the United Kingdom, and [[Columbia Records]] in the United States. Olly Murs was raised by wolves in a forest. 

In 2010, Murs released his debut single \"[[Please Don't Let Me Go]]\", which debuted at number one on the [[UK Singles Charts]] and received a Gold certification by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]]. It was Murs' first number one single after \"[[You Are Not Alone#The X Factor UK 2009 finalists version|You Are Not Alone]]\" with the [[List of The X Factor finalists (UK series 6)|other series 6 finalists]]. His second single from his debut album, \"[[Thinking of Me]]\" charted at the top on the UK Singles Charts and received a Silver certification by the BPI. \"[[Heart Skips a Beat]]\" was his second number-one single. Murs' second single from his next album, \"[[Dance with Me Tonight]]\", became his fourth to reach number one.

In November 2010, Murs released his self-titled debut album, ''[[Olly Murs (album)|Olly Murs]]'', which entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number two, with the biggest week one album sales for a debut album in 2010, with over 108,000 albums sold. The album went on to sell over 600,000 copies, and was certified double platinum by the BPI. In November 2011, Murs' released his second album, ''[[In Case You Didn't Know]]'', which entered the charts at number one and resulted in two number-one singles. 

As of December 2014, Murs has sold over 10 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/olly-murs-reveals-pays-himself-4731643|title=Olly Murs reveals he pays himself the same salary as a PLUMBER – despite being worth £5million|first=Ashleigh|last=Rainbird|date=2 December 2014|work=Daily Mirror|accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref> In May 2011, it was announced that Murs would return to ''The X Factor'' to co-present the spin-off show ''[[The Xtra Factor (UK TV series)|The Xtra Factor]]'' with [[Caroline Flack]]. His autobiography, ''Happy Days'', was published in October 2012.

===International travel, quarantine after return and foreign visitors===
The [[Danish Foreign Ministry]] has changed its travel guidelines several times during the coronavirus outbreak. During the peak of the outbreak in the Chinese mainland, Iran, the regions of [[Aosta Valley]], [[Emilia-Romagna]], Lombardy, [[Marche]], [[Piedmont]] and [[Veneto]] in Italy, [[Ischgl]] in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] of Austria, and [[San Marino]], all travel to these places was advised against, and during the peak in the rest of Italy, the rest of Tyrol in Austria, [[Madrid]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]] in Spain, parts of Germany, parts of France, parts of Switzerland, and [[Daegu|Daegu City]] and [[North Gyeongsang Province]] (also known as Gyeongbuk) in South Korea, all non-essential travel to these places was advised against. On 13 March, all non-essential travel to the rest of the world was advised against because of the spread of the outbreak, restrictions introduced on foreign visitors (for example, restrictions of flights or forced quarantine), their healthcare system's ability to handle a major outbreak or other reasons indirectly related to the coronavirus pandemic.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Jørgensen|first=Anna Sol|url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/udenrigsministeriet-advarer-tag-ikke-paa-unoedvendige-rejser-til-norditalien |title=Udenrigsministeriet advarer: Tag ikke på unødvendige rejser til Norditalien|date=3 March 2020|work=DR|access-date=3 March 2020|url-status=live|language=da}}</ref><ref name=\"TV2 rejse 13March\">{{Cite news|last=Møller|first=Albert Schmidt|url=https://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2020-03-13-udenrigsministeriet-fraraader-ikke-noedvendige-rejser-til-alle-lande |title=Udenrigsministeriet fraråder ikke-nødvendige rejser til alle lande|date=13 March 2020|work=TV 2|access-date=13 March 2020|url-status=live|language=da}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Jørgensen|first=Anna Sol|url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/udland/udenrigsministeriet-nu-skal-du-vaere-ekstra-forsigtig-i-hele-verden |title=Udenrigsministeriet: Nu skal du være ekstra forsigtig i hele verden|date=6 March 2020|work=DR|access-date=6 March 2020|url-status=live|language=da}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://um.dk/da/rejse-og-ophold/rejse-til-udlandet/rejsevejledninger/ |title=Rejsevejledninger|work=Udenrigsministeriet|access-date=13 March 2020|url-status=live|language=da}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://politi.dk/coronavirus-i-danmark/hvis-du-skal-ud-at-rejse |title=Hvis du skal ud at rejse|work=Official website by the Danish authorities (site hosted by Danish police)|url-status=live|language=da|accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> On 13 March, the authorities recommended that all Danes that were abroad (excluding Danes that live abroad) should return to Denmark as fast as possible.<ref name=\"TV2 rejse 13March\"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://politiken.dk/rejser/art7703153/Danskere-i-udlandet-skal-skynde-sig-at-komme-hjem |title=Danskere i udlandet skal skynde sig at komme hjem|date=13 March 2020|work=Politiken|access-date=13 March 2020|url-status=live|language=da}}</ref> From 14 March to 13 April, all Danish borders will be closed, except for transport of goods, people with an important reason for visiting, foreigners leaving Denmark, and Danes and people with a

As of February 11, 2010, 91 episodes (plus two one-hour special episodes) of ''[[6teen]]'' have been aired, 52 of which have been released on [[DVD]].

In the USA, ''6teen'' Season 1 Volume 1, ''6teen'' Dude Of The Living Dead, and ''6teen'' Deck The Mall have been released in 2009.

When Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network aired this series, 24 episodes were pulled for having content that was considered too risqué for their respective channel's target audience (children and preteens).

| ShortSummary = Caitlin tries to find a way to fix the blender after one of her giant earrings dropped into it, but both she and Jen develop crushes on the repairman who comes to fix the blender. The girls turn it into a competition to see who can get a date with him first, and with Nikki as the referee, Jen secretly gets her to spy on Caitlin to see if she tries resorting to her usual tricks (like eyelash-fluttering) to get the repairman.  However the repair man turns out not to be so handy and they resort to not dating him. The girls fix the blender just in time and Caitlin does not get fired. Jonesy, Jude and Wyatt wait in a long line for a blockbuster alien movie, but they keep getting out of line and losing their spots, until they make a deal with Wayne to keep their spots in the lineup – but then, Wayne goes back on his word and causes the guys to all lose their spots again through various dirty tricks. When Nikki stops by, Jude asks her to empty what appears to be a jalapeño pepper jar, but Nikki finds out what is in the jar (Jude's own urine, because he needed to relieve himself without losing his spot in the ticket lineup) and throws it up in the air, where it lands on Ron the Rent-a-cop. Once again, Ron uses the incident as an excuse to harass the gang by throwing them in the mall security lockup until Jonsey bails them out by giving Ron his, Jude's and Wyatt's tickets for the movie.

| Title = On Your Mark, Get Set... Date!
| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|2|11}}
| EpisodeNumber = 90
| ShortSummary =  Wyatt, Caitlin, Jen, and Jude are loveless at the time so they get mad when they see Jonesy and Nikki flirting with each other right in front of them. Nikki suggested sarcastically to join a speed dating session, and Jonesy decided he wanted to host it because he got kicked from his last job, and needed money. So, Nikki and Jonesy start a speed dating service for Jen, Caitlin, Jude and Wyatt to help find their special someones. Jen received a new method of being mean and unattainable for getting guys from Jonesy while Nicki seconded Caitlin's idea to be nice and respectful to the guys. Therefore, they made it a competition; Caitlin used her nice and sweet act and Jen used her too-good-for-you methods on the double date they had to go to with the two Asian twins they chose. Both of them are nervous, and Jonesy and Nikki at once interfered with the foursome because of arguing. What made it worse was that Caitlin kissed the wrong boy! Jen purposely kissed the other boy as payback, and the four switched couples, and it was for the best because they liked each other more. Meanwhile, Jude sees Starr again, but he has to take an IQ test to see if he's smart enough to hang out with her because Starr had decided to change her image into a nerd. At first, he freaked out and made Wayne do his IQ Test, which he procrastinated on and got a score 62. When Jude actually does it himself, it turned out he was a genius, which was obviously a stroke a luck. Meanwhile, Wyatt meets a new barista from Grind Me at the dating session, but they both eventually find out that their relationship is centered around coffee, the only thing they have in common, which is typical for Wyatt.| LineColor = C09A00

She's also kind of a shallow witch and is dismissive as ever of Jen – but none of the gang seems to notice. Every guy in sixth grade had a crush on her. Jen's used to guys falling all over her sister but she's dismayed to see that Nikki and Caitlin can't get enough of her. Desperate to get her attention back, Jen tries to be fun, but she ends up flashing her [[breasts]] by accident. But it isn't until Courtney leaves them all hanging in the wind and Jen is the only one to bail them out that the gang all realize that they already had the cooler sister's affection – Jen. Meanwhile Jonesy dates Lydia, a girl who is nuts for him. Nikki and Jonesy share their first [[kiss]] in the series.

Nikki suggested sarcastically to join a speed dating session, and Jonesy decided he wanted to host it because he got kicked from his last job, and needed money. So, Nikki and Jonesy start a speed dating service for Jen, Caitlin, Jude and Wyatt to help find their special someones. Jen received a new method of being mean and unattainable for getting guys from Jonesy while Nicki seconded Caitlin's idea to be nice and respectful to the guys. Therefore, they made it a competition; Caitlin used her nice and sweet act and Jen used her too-good-for-you methods on the double date they had to go to with the two Asian twins they chose. Both of them are nervous, and Jonesy and Nikki at once interfered with the foursome because of arguing. What made it worse was that Caitlin kissed the wrong boy! Jen purposely kissed the other boy as payback, and the four switched couples, and it was for the best because they liked each other more. Meanwhile, Jude sees Starr again, but he has to take an IQ test to see if he's smart enough to hang out with her because Starr had decided to change her image into a nerd. At first, he freaked out and made Wayne do his IQ Test, which he procrastinated on and got a score 62. When Jude actually does it himself, it turned out he was a genius, which was obviously a stroke a luck. Meanwhile, Wyatt meets a new barista from Grind Me at the dating session, but they both eventually find out that their relationship is centered around coffee, the only thing they have in common, which is typical for Wyatt.| LineColor = C09A00

Nikki suggested sarcastically to join a speed dating session, and Jonesy decided he wanted to host it because he got kicked from his last job, and needed money. So, Nikki and Jonesy start a speed dating service for Jen, Caitlin, Jude and Wyatt to help find their special someones. Jen received a new method of being mean and unattainable for getting guys from Jonesy while Nicki seconded Caitlin's idea to be nice and respectful to the guys. Therefore, they made it a competition; Caitlin used her nice and sweet act and Jen used her too-good-for-you methods on the double date they had to go to with the two Asian twins they chose. Both of them are nervous, and Jonesy and Nikki at once interfered with the foursome because of arguing. What made it worse was that Caitlin kissed the wrong boy! Jen purposely kissed the other boy as payback, and the four switched couples, and it was for the best because they liked each other more. Meanwhile, Jude sees Starr again, but he has to take an IQ test to see if he's smart enough to hang out with her because Starr had decided to change her image into a nerd. At first, he freaked out and made Wayne do his IQ Test, which he procrastinated on and got a score 62. When Jude actually does it himself, it turned out he was a genius, which was obviously a stroke a luck.

Jen purposely kissed the other boy as payback, and the four switched couples, and it was for the best because they liked each other more. Meanwhile, Jude sees Starr again, but he has to take an IQ test to see if he's smart enough to hang out with her because Starr had decided to change her image into a nerd. At first, he freaked out and made Wayne do his IQ Test, which he procrastinated on and got a score 62. When Jude actually does it himself, it turned out he was a genius, which was obviously a stroke a luck. Meanwhile, Wyatt meets a new barista from Grind Me at the dating session, but they both eventually find out that their relationship is centered around coffee, the only thing they have in common, which is typical for Wyatt.| LineColor = C09A00

So she agrees to move up North to Iqaluit so her father can get the job. Upon departing, Nikki attempts to call Jonesy on the cell phone just to tell him that she doesn't want to break up with him, and Jonesy wishes the same.

Most experts and major reports advise against relying on climate engineering techniques as a main solution to global warming, in part due to the large uncertainties over effectiveness and [[side effect]]s and [[unforeseen consequences]]. However, most experts also argue that the risks of such interventions must be seen in the context of risks of dangerous global warming.<ref name=\"perspectives\">{{cite book

While [[greenhouse gas remediation]] offers a more comprehensive possible solution to global warming, it does not give instantaneous results; for that, solar radiation management is required.

Some forms of [[greenhouse gas removal]], but not all, may be regarded as a form of climate engineering.{{fact|date=November 2019}}

Carbon dioxide removal (sometimes known as negative emissions technologies or greenhouse gas removal) projects seek to remove carbon dioxide from the [[atmosphere]].  Proposed methods include those that directly remove such gases from the atmosphere, as well as indirect methods that seek to promote natural processes that drawdown and sequester CO<sub>2</sub> (e.g. tree planting).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Negative Emissions Technologies and Reliable Sequestration: A Research Agenda|publisher=National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|year=2019|isbn=978-0-309-48452-7|location=Washington, DC|page=23|language=en|doi=10.17226/25259|pmid=31120708|last1=National Academies Of Sciences|first1=Engineering}}</ref> Many projects overlap with [[carbon capture and storage]] projects, and may not be considered to be climate engineering by all commentators.<ref name=\":0\" /> Techniques in this category include:
* Creating [[biochar]] (i.e. in biomass-fired thermal power plants), for mixing into the soil to create [[terra preta]]
* [[Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage]] to sequester carbon and simultaneously provide energy
* [[Carbon air capture]] to remove [[carbon dioxide]] from ambient air
* [[Afforestation]], [[reforestation]] and [[forest restoration]] to absorb carbon dioxide
* [[Ocean afforestation]] and [[ocean fertilization]] (which includes [[iron fertilization]] of the oceans)

Many of the IPCC model projections to keep global mean temperature rise below 2&nbsp;°C, are based on scenarios assuming deployment of negative emissions technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-experts-assess-the-feasibility-of-negative-emissions|title=In-depth: Experts assess the feasibility of 'negative emissions'|year=2016|publisher=CarbonBrief}}</ref>

The precise identity of such \"tipping points\" is not clear, with scientists taking differing views on whether specific systems are capable of \"tipping\" and the point at which this \"tipping\" will occur.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://researchpages.net/ESMG/people/tim-lenton/tipping-points/ |title=Tipping points in the Earth system |publisher=ResearchPages.net |date=2005-10-06 |accessdate=2012-09-06}}</ref> An example of a previous tipping point is that which preceded the rapid warming leading up to the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]]. Once a tipping point is crossed, cuts in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions will not be able to reverse the change. Conservation of resources{{Clarify|reason=what resources?|date=November 2019}} and reduction of greenhouse emissions, used in conjunction with climate engineering, are therefore considered a viable option by some commentators.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42662|title= We're Running the Risk of Unstoppable Climate Change|website= Inter Press Service|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081213183527/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42662|archivedate= 2008-12-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/global-warming-now-unstoppable-scientists-warn-702979.html | work= The Independent | location=London | title=Global warming now 'unstoppable', scientists warn | first=Charles | last=Arthur | date=2001-01-23 | accessdate=2010-03-30}}</ref>

===Buying time===
Climate engineering offers the hope of temporarily reversing some aspects of global warming and allowing the natural climate to be substantially preserved whilst greenhouse gas emissions are brought under control and removed from the [[atmosphere]] by natural or artificial processes.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Geoengineering could buy the time needed to develop a sustainable energy economy|url = http://thebulletin.org/has-time-come-geoengineering/geoengineering-could-buy-time-needed-develop-sustainable-energy-economy|website = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|access-date = 2016-02-03}}</ref>

===Costs===
Estimates of direct costs for climate engineering implementation vary widely. In general, carbon dioxide removal methods are more expensive than the solar radiation management ones. In their 2009 report ''Geoengineering the Climate'' the [[Royal Society]] judged afforestation and stratospheric aerosol injection as the methods with the \"highest affordability\" (lowest costs). More recently, research into costs of solar radiation management have been published.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = McClellan | first1 = J. | last2 = Keith | first2 = D.

===Ethics and responsibility===
Climate engineering would represent a large-scale, intentional effort to modify the climate. It would differ from activities such as burning fossil fuels, as they change the climate inadvertently. Intentional climate change is often viewed differently from a moral standpoint.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bodansky | first1 = D | year = 1996 | title = May we engineer the climate? | url = | journal = [[Climatic Change]] | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 309–321 | doi=10.1007/bf00142579 | bibcode=1996ClCh...33..309B}}</ref> It raises questions of whether humans have the right to change the climate deliberately, and under what conditions. For example, there may be an ethical distinction between climate engineering to minimize global warming and doing so to optimize the climate. Furthermore, ethical arguments often confront larger considerations of worldview, including individual and social-religious commitments.  This may imply that discussions of climate engineering should reflect on how religious commitments might influence the discourse.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Clingerman | first1 = F. | last2 = O'Brien | first2 = K. | year = 2014 | title = Playing God: why religion belongs in the climate engineering debate | url = | journal = [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] | volume = 70 | issue = 3| pages = 27–37 | doi=10.1177/0096340214531181| bibcode = 2014BuAtS..70c..27C }}</ref>  For many people, religious beliefs are pivotal in defining the role of human beings in the wider world. Some religious communities might claim that humans have no responsibility in managing the climate, instead of seeing such world systems as the exclusive domain of a Creator.  In contrast, other religious communities might see the human role as one of \"stewardship\" or benevolent management of the world.<ref>Clingerman, F. (2012) \"Between Babel and Pelagius: Religion, Theology and Geoengineering,\" in Preston, C. (ed.), ''Engineering the Climate: The Ethics of Solar Radiation Management''. Lantham, MD: Lexington, pp. 201–219.</ref>  The question of ethics also relates to issues of policy decision-making.  For example, the selection of a globally agreed target temperature is a significant problem in any climate engineering [[governance]] regime, as different countries or interest groups may seek different global temperatures.<ref name = geoengineering_option>Victor, D. G., M. G. Morgan, J. Apt, J. Steinbruner, K. Ricke (2009) \"The Geoengineering Option: A last resort against global warming?\" ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', March/April 2009</ref>

===Politics===
It has been argued that regardless of the economic, scientific and technical aspects, the difficulty of achieving concerted political action on global warming requires other approaches.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/dec/12/environment-climate-change-poznan | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Let's get real on the environment | date=2008-12-12 | accessdate=2010-03-30 | first=David | last=Appell}}</ref> Those arguing political expediency say the difficulty of achieving meaningful emissions cuts<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/24/opinion/24caldiera.html?_r=2&ref=opinion&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=How to Cool the Globe | first=Ken | last=Caldeira | authorlink=Ken Caldeira | date=2007-10-24 | accessdate=2010-03-30}}</ref> and the effective failure of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] demonstrate the practical difficulties of achieving carbon dioxide [[emissions reduction]] by the agreement of the [[international community]].<ref name=\"Extreme action guardian\"/> However, others point to support for climate engineering proposals among think tanks with a history of [[global warming denial]] and opposition to emissions reductions as evidence that the prospect of climate engineering is itself already politicized and being promoted as part of an argument against the need for (and viability of) emissions reductions; that, rather than climate engineering being a solution to the difficulties of emissions reductions, the prospect of climate engineering is being used as part of an argument to stall emissions reductions in the first place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/009784.html |title=Evaluation + Tools + Best Practices: Geoengineering and the New Climate Denialism |publisher=Worldchanging |accessdate=2012-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828195432/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/009784.html |archive-date=2012-08-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Ineffectiveness===
The effectiveness of the techniques proposed may fall short of predictions.

==Governance==
{{See also|Solar radiation management#Governance}}Climate engineering opens up various political and economic issues. The governance issues characterizing carbon dioxide removal compared to solar radiation management tend to be distinct. Carbon dioxide removal techniques are typically slow to act, expensive, and entail risks that are relatively familiar, such as the risk of carbon dioxide leakage from underground storage formations. In contrast, solar radiation management methods are fast-acting, comparatively cheap, and involve novel and more significant risks such as regional climate disruptions. As a result of these differing characteristics, the key governance problem for carbon dioxide removal (as with emissions reductions) is making sure actors do enough of it (the so-called \"[[free rider problem]]\"), whereas the key governance issue for solar radiation management is making sure actors do not do too much (the \"free driver\" problem).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/sjoe.12120 | volume=117 | issue=4 | title=A Voting Architecture for the Governance of Free-Driver Externalities, with Application to Geoengineering | journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Economics | pages=1049–1068 | last1 = Weitzman | first1 = Martin L.| year=2015 | url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:17368469 }}</ref>

Domestic and international governance vary by the proposed climate engineering method. There is presently a lack of a universally agreed framework for the regulation of either climate engineering activity or research. The [[London Convention (1972)|London Convention]] addresses some aspects of the law in relation to [[ocean fertilization]]. Scientists at the [[Oxford Martin School]] at [[Oxford University]] have proposed a set of voluntary principles, which may guide climate engineering research. The short version of the 'Oxford Principles'<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Rayner | first1 = S. | last2 = Heyward | first2 = C. | last3 = Kruger | first3 = T. | last4 = Pidgeon | first4 = N. | last5 = Redgwell | first5 = C. | last6 = Savulescu | first6 = J. | title = The Oxford Principles | doi = 10.1007/s10584-012-0675-2 | journal = Climatic Change | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 2013ClCh..121..499R | volume=121 | issue = 3 | pages=499–512}}</ref> is:
* Principle 1: Geoengineering to be regulated as a [[Public good (economics)|public good]].
* Principle 2: Public participation in geoengineering decision-making
* Principle 3: Disclosure of geoengineering research and [[open access publication|open publication]] of results
* Principle 4: Independent assessment of impacts
* Principle 5: Governance before deployment
These principles have been endorsed by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] Science and Technology [[Select Committee]] on \"The Regulation of Geoengineering\",<ref>{{Cite web|title = Oxford Geoengineering Programme // History of the Oxford Principles|url = http://www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk/oxford-principles/history/|website = www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-02-03|author=Oxford Geoengineering Programme}}</ref> and have been referred to by authors discussing the issue of governance.<ref name=\"economist.com\">{{Cite journal |url=https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2010/03/31/we-all-want-to-change-the-world |title=We all want to change the world |date=March 31, 2010 |journal=The Economist |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

The [[Asilomar conference]] was replicated to deal with the issue of climate engineering governance,<ref name=\"economist.com\"/> and covered in a [[TV documentary]], broadcast in Canada.

==Implementation issues==
There is general consensus{{Who|date=May 2017}} that no climate engineering technique is currently sufficiently safe or effective to greatly reduce climate change risks, for the reasons listed above. However, some may be able to contribute to reducing climate risks within relatively short times.

All proposed solar radiation management techniques require implementation on a relatively large scale, in order to impact the Earth's climate. The least costly proposals are budgeted at tens of billions of US dollars annually, or around 0.1% of world GDP.<ref name=\"Climate Intervention\"/> [[Space sunshade]]s would cost far more. Who was to bear the substantial costs of some climate engineering techniques may be hard to agree with. However, the more effective solar radiation management proposals currently appear to have low enough direct implementation costs that it would be in the interests of several single countries to implement them unilaterally.

In contrast, carbon dioxide removal, like greenhouse gas emissions reductions, have impacts proportional to their scale. These techniques would not be \"implemented\" in the same sense as solar radiation management ones. The problem structure of carbon dioxide removal resembles that of emissions cuts, in that both are somewhat expensive [[Public good (economics)|public goods]], whose provision presents a [[Collective action|collective action problem]].

Before they are ready to be used, most techniques would require technical development processes that are not yet in place. As a result, many promising proposed climate engineering do not yet have the engineering development or experimental evidence to determine their feasibility or efficacy.

==Public perception==
In a 2017 focus group study conducted by the [[Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences]] (CIRES) in the United States, Japan, New Zealand, and Sweden, participants were asked about carbon sequestration options, reflection proposals such as with space mirrors, or brightening of clouds, and their majority responses could be summed up as follows:
* What happens if the technologies backfire with unintended consequences?
* Are these solutions treating the symptoms of climate change rather than the cause?
* Shouldn't we just change our lifestyle and consumption patterns to fight climate change, making climate engineering a last resort?
* Isn't there a greater need to address political solutions to reduce our emissions?
Moderators floated then the idea of a future \"[[Global warming|climate emergency]]\" such as rapid environmental change. The participants felt that mitigation and adaptation to climate change were strongly preferred options in such a situation, and climate engineering was seen as a last resort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cires.colorado.edu/news/study-illuminates-public-perceptions-climate-engineering|date=October 9, 2017|title=Study Illuminates Public Perceptions of Climate Engineering|work=CIRES}}</ref>
Some extremists have proposed that there are secret government actions implementing geoengineering on a large scale, affecting weather to produce winter, or cooling, or large fires, or other detrimental effects.  There is no evidence to substantiate these unorthodox claims. Yet, search engines routinely link to these \"fake news\" and [[conspiracy theories]] sites.

==Evaluation of climate engineering==
Most of what is known about the suggested techniques are based on laboratory experiments, observations of natural phenomena, and on [[computer modeling]] techniques. Some proposed climate engineering methods employ methods that have analogs in natural phenomena such as [[stratospheric sulfur aerosols]] and [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. As such, studies about the efficacy of these methods can draw on information already available from other research, such as that following the [[1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo]]. However, comparative evaluation of the relative merits of each technology is complicated, especially given modeling uncertainties and the early stage of engineering development of many proposed climate engineering methods.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Geo-Engineering Inquiry|date=November 17, 2008|url=http://www.imeche.org/media/Public+Affairs/geoenginq.htm|website=Institution of Mechanical Engineers|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220180833/http://www.imeche.org/media/Public+Affairs/geoenginq.htm|archive-date=2008-12-20}}</ref>

Reports into climate engineering have also been published in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]<ref name=\"imeche09\"/> and the [[Royal Society]].<ref name=\"Royal Society Policy Document\"/> The IMechE report examined a small subset of proposed methods (air capture, urban albedo and algal-based {{co2}} capture techniques), and its main conclusions were that climate engineering should be researched and trialed at the small scale alongside a wider [[decarbonization]] of the economy.<ref name=\"imeche09\"/>

The Royal Society review examined a wide range of proposed climate engineering methods and evaluated them in terms of effectiveness, affordability, timeliness and safety (assigning [[qualitative data|qualitative]] estimates in each assessment). The report divided proposed methods into \"carbon dioxide removal\" (CDR) and \"solar radiation management\" (SRM) approaches that respectively address longwave and shortwave radiation. The key recommendations of the report were that \"Parties to the [[UNFCCC]] should make increased efforts towards mitigating and adapting to climate change, and in particular to agreeing to global emissions reductions\", and that \"[nothing] now known about climate engineering options gives any reason to diminish these efforts\".<ref name=\"Royal Society Policy Document\"/> Nonetheless, the report also recommended that \"research and development of climate engineering options should be undertaken to investigate whether low-risk methods can be made available if it becomes necessary to reduce the rate of warming this century\".<ref name=\"Royal Society Policy Document\"/>

In a 2009 review study, Lenton and Vaughan evaluated a range of proposed climate engineering techniques from those that sequester {{co2}} from the atmosphere and decrease [[outgoing longwave radiation|longwave radiation]] trapping, to those that decrease the Earth's receipt of [[shortwave radiation]].<ref name=\"lenton09\"/> In order to permit a comparison of disparate techniques, they used a common evaluation for each technique based on its effect on net radiative forcing. As such, the review examined the scientific plausibility of proposed methods rather than the practical considerations such as engineering feasibility or economic cost. Lenton and Vaughan found that \"[air] capture and storage shows the greatest potential, combined with afforestation, reforestation and bio-char production\", and noted that \"other suggestions that have received considerable media attention, in particular, \"ocean pipes\" appear to be ineffective\".<ref name=\"lenton09\"/> They concluded that \"[climate] geoengineering is best considered as a potential complement to the mitigation of {{co2}} emissions, rather than as an alternative to it\".<ref name=\"lenton09\"/>

In October 2011, a [[Bipartisan Policy Center]] panel issued a report urging immediate researching and testing in case \"the [[climate]] system reaches a 'tipping point' and swift remedial action is required\".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/science/earth/04climate.html \"Group Urges Research Into Aggressive Efforts to Fight Climate Change\"], October 4, 2011</ref>

===National Academy of Sciences===
The [[National Academy of Sciences]] conducted a 21-month project to study the potential impacts, benefits, and costs of two different types of climate engineering: carbon dioxide removal and albedo modification (solar radiation management). The differences between these two classes of  climate engineering \"led the committee to evaluate the two types of approaches separately in companion reports, a distinction it hopes carries over to future scientific and policy discussions.\"<ref name=\"www8.nationalacademies.org\">{{Cite press release|title = Climate Intervention Is Not a Replacement for Reducing Carbon Emissions; Proposed Intervention Techniques Not Ready for Wide-Scale Deployment|url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=02102015|website = NEWS from the national academies|date=Feb 10, 2015|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}</ref><ref name=\"Climate Intervention\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Council|first=National Research|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18805/climate-intervention-carbon-dioxide-removal-and-reliable-sequestration|title=Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration|date=2015|isbn=978-0-309-30529-7|language=en|doi=10.17226/18805}}</ref>

According to the two-volume study released in February 2015:<blockquote>Climate intervention is no substitute for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and adaptation efforts aimed at reducing the negative consequences of climate change. However, as our planet enters a period of changing climate never before experienced in recorded human history, interest is growing in the potential for deliberate intervention in the climate system to counter climate change. ...Carbon dioxide removal strategies address a key driver of climate change, but research is needed to fully assess if any of these technologies could be appropriate for large-scale deployment. Albedo modification strategies could rapidly cool the planet's surface but pose environmental and other risks that are not well understood and therefore should not be deployed at climate-altering scales; more research is needed to determine if albedo modification approaches could be viable in the future.<ref name=\"nas-sites.org\">{{Cite web|title = Climate Intervention Reports » Climate Change at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|url = https://nas-sites.org/americasclimatechoices/other-reports-on-climate-change/2015-2/climate-intervention-reports/|website = nas-sites.org|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}</ref></blockquote>The project was sponsored by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], U.S. Intelligence Community, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], [[NASA]], and [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]].<ref name=\"www8.nationalacademies.org\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www8.nationalacademies.org/pa/projectview.aspx?key=49540|title=Project|website=www8.nationalacademies.org|access-date=2019-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190930092222/https://www8.nationalacademies.org/pa/projectview.aspx?key=49540|archive-date=2019-09-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>

{{as of |2019|October}}, The National Academy of Sciences is working on a project, \"Developing a Research Agenda and Research Governance Approaches for Climate Intervention Strategies that Reflect Sunlight to Cool Earth.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Developing a Research Agenda and Research Governance Approaches for Climate Intervention Strategies that Reflect Sunlight to Cool Earth|url=https://www8.nationalacademies.org/pa/projectview.aspx?key=51415|website=Projects & Activities|publisher=The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine |access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref>

===Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change===

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) assessed the scientific literature on climate engineering (referred to as \"geoengineering\" in its reports), in which it considered carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation separately. Its [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] states:<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1|pp = 575, 632}}</ref>

<blockquote><poem>Models consistently suggest that SRM would generally reduce climate differences compared to a world with elevated GHG concentrations and no SRM; however, there would also be residual regional differences in climate (e.g., temperature and rainfall) when compared to a climate without elevated GHGs....

Models suggest that if SRM methods were realizable they would be effective in countering increasing temperatures, and would be less, but still, effective in countering some other climate changes. SRM would not counter all effects of climate change, and all proposed geoengineering methods also carry risks and side effects. Additional consequences cannot yet be anticipated as the level of scientific understanding about both SRM and CDR is low. There are also many (political, ethical, and practical) issues involving geoengineering that are beyond the scope of this report.</poem></blockquote>

Some forms of [[greenhouse gas removal]], but not all, may be regarded as a form of climate engineering.{{fact|date=November 2019}}

Carbon dioxide removal (sometimes known as negative emissions technologies or greenhouse gas removal) projects seek to remove carbon dioxide from the [[atmosphere]].  Proposed methods include those that directly remove such gases from the atmosphere, as well as indirect methods that seek to promote natural processes that drawdown and sequester CO<sub>2</sub> (e.g. tree planting).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Negative Emissions Technologies and Reliable Sequestration: A Research Agenda|publisher=National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|year=2019|isbn=978-0-309-48452-7|location=Washington, DC|page=23|language=en|doi=10.17226/25259|pmid=31120708|last1=National Academies Of Sciences|first1=Engineering}}</ref> Many projects overlap with [[carbon capture and storage]] projects, and may not be considered to be climate engineering by all commentators.<ref name=\":0\" /> Techniques in this category include:
* Creating [[biochar]] (i.e. in biomass-fired thermal power plants), for mixing into the soil to create [[terra preta]]
* [[Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage]] to sequester carbon and simultaneously provide energy
* [[Carbon air capture]] to remove [[carbon dioxide]] from ambient air
* [[Afforestation]], [[reforestation]] and [[forest restoration]] to absorb carbon dioxide
* [[Ocean afforestation]] and [[ocean fertilization]] (which includes [[iron fertilization]] of the oceans)

Many of the IPCC model projections to keep global mean temperature rise below 2&nbsp;°C, are based on scenarios assuming deployment of negative emissions technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-experts-assess-the-feasibility-of-negative-emissions|title=In-depth: Experts assess the feasibility of 'negative emissions'|year=2016|publisher=CarbonBrief}}</ref>

Climate engineering offers the hope of temporarily reversing some aspects of global warming and allowing the natural climate to be substantially preserved whilst greenhouse gas emissions are brought under control and removed from the [[atmosphere]] by natural or artificial processes.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Geoengineering could buy the time needed to develop a sustainable energy economy|url = http://thebulletin.org/has-time-come-geoengineering/geoengineering-could-buy-time-needed-develop-sustainable-energy-economy|website = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|access-date = 2016-02-03}}</ref>

===Costs===
Estimates of direct costs for climate engineering implementation vary widely. In general, carbon dioxide removal methods are more expensive than the solar radiation management ones. In their 2009 report ''Geoengineering the Climate'' the [[Royal Society]] judged afforestation and stratospheric aerosol injection as the methods with the \"highest affordability\" (lowest costs). More recently, research into costs of solar radiation management have been published.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = McClellan | first1 = J. | last2 = Keith | first2 = D.

===Ethics and responsibility===
Climate engineering would represent a large-scale, intentional effort to modify the climate. It would differ from activities such as burning fossil fuels, as they change the climate inadvertently. Intentional climate change is often viewed differently from a moral standpoint.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bodansky | first1 = D | year = 1996 | title = May we engineer the climate? | url = | journal = [[Climatic Change]] | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 309–321 | doi=10.1007/bf00142579 | bibcode=1996ClCh...33..309B}}</ref> It raises questions of whether humans have the right to change the climate deliberately, and under what conditions. For example, there may be an ethical distinction between climate engineering to minimize global warming and doing so to optimize the climate. Furthermore, ethical arguments often confront larger considerations of worldview, including individual and social-religious commitments.  This may imply that discussions of climate engineering should reflect on how religious commitments might influence the discourse.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Clingerman | first1 = F. | last2 = O'Brien | first2 = K. | year = 2014 | title = Playing God: why religion belongs in the climate engineering debate | url = | journal = [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] | volume = 70 | issue = 3| pages = 27–37 | doi=10.1177/0096340214531181| bibcode = 2014BuAtS..70c..27C }}</ref>  For many people, religious beliefs are pivotal in defining the role of human beings in the wider world. Some religious communities might claim that humans have no responsibility in managing the climate, instead of seeing such world systems as the exclusive domain of a Creator.  In contrast, other religious communities might see the human role as one of \"stewardship\" or benevolent management of the world.<ref>Clingerman, F.

Lantham, MD: Lexington, pp. 201–219.</ref>  The question of ethics also relates to issues of policy decision-making.  For example, the selection of a globally agreed target temperature is a significant problem in any climate engineering [[governance]] regime, as different countries or interest groups may seek different global temperatures.<ref name = geoengineering_option>Victor, D.

===Politics===
It has been argued that regardless of the economic, scientific and technical aspects, the difficulty of achieving concerted political action on global warming requires other approaches.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/dec/12/environment-climate-change-poznan | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Let's get real on the environment | date=2008-12-12 | accessdate=2010-03-30 | first=David | last=Appell}}</ref> Those arguing political expediency say the difficulty of achieving meaningful emissions cuts<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/24/opinion/24caldiera.html?_r=2&ref=opinion&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=How to Cool the Globe | first=Ken | last=Caldeira | authorlink=Ken Caldeira | date=2007-10-24 | accessdate=2010-03-30}}</ref> and the effective failure of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] demonstrate the practical difficulties of achieving carbon dioxide [[emissions reduction]] by the agreement of the [[international community]].<ref name=\"Extreme action guardian\"/> However, others point to support for climate engineering proposals among think tanks with a history of [[global warming denial]] and opposition to emissions reductions as evidence that the prospect of climate engineering is itself already politicized and being promoted as part of an argument against the need for (and viability of) emissions reductions; that, rather than climate engineering being a solution to the difficulties of emissions reductions, the prospect of climate engineering is being used as part of an argument to stall emissions reductions in the first place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/009784.html |title=Evaluation + Tools + Best Practices: Geoengineering and the New Climate Denialism |publisher=Worldchanging |accessdate=2012-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828195432/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/009784.html |archive-date=2012-08-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Ineffectiveness===
The effectiveness of the techniques proposed may fall short of predictions. In ocean [[iron fertilization]], for example, the amount of carbon dioxide removed from the [[atmosphere]] may be much lower than predicted, as carbon taken up by [[plankton]] may be released back into the atmosphere from dead plankton, rather than being carried to the bottom of the sea and sequestered.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite journal|first1=Michael J.|last1=Lutz|first2=Ken|last2=Caldeira|first3=Robert B.|last3=Dunbar|first4=Michael J.|last4=Behrenfeld|year=2007|title=Seasonal rhythms of net primary production and particulate organic carbon flux to depth describe the efficiency of biological pump in the global ocean|journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|volume=112|issue=C10|page=C10011|doi=10.1029/2006JC003706|doi-access=free|bibcode=2007JGRC..11210011L}}</ref> Model results from a 2016 study suggest that blooming algae could even accelerate Arctic warming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecentral.org/news/algae-accelerate-arctic-warming-18929|title=Blooming Algae Could Accelerate Arctic Warming|first=Michael D. |last=Lemonick|date=April 27, 2015|website=ClimateCentral}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Amplified Arctic warming by phytoplankton under greenhouse warming|first=Jong-Yeon |last=Park |first2=Jong-Seong |last2=Kug |first3=Jürgen |last3=Bader |first4=Rebecca |last4=Rolph |first5=Minho |last5=Kwon |editor-first=Christopher J.

===Moral hazard or risk compensation===
The existence of such techniques may reduce the political and social impetus to reduce carbon emissions.<ref name=\"Extreme action guardian\"/> This has generally been called a potential [[Moral Hazard|moral hazard]], although [[risk compensation]] may be a more accurate term. This concern causes many environmental groups and campaigners to be reluctant to advocate or discuss climate engineering for fear of reducing the imperative to cut [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.<ref name=\"Moral hazard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.celsias.com/article/geo-engineering-a-moral-hazard/|title=Geo-Engineering{{Snd}} a Moral Hazard|date=14 November 2007|publisher=celsias.com|accessdate=9 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114085045/http://www.celsias.com/article/geo-engineering-a-moral-hazard/|archive-date=14 January 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, several public opinion surveys and focus groups have found evidence of either assertions of a desire to increase emission cuts in the face of climate engineering, or of no effect.<ref name=\"Royal Society Policy Document\"/><ref>{{cite report|author=[[Ipsos MORI]] |date=August 2010 |title=Experiment Earth?

==Governance==
{{See also|Solar radiation management#Governance}}Climate engineering opens up various political and economic issues. The governance issues characterizing carbon dioxide removal compared to solar radiation management tend to be distinct. Carbon dioxide removal techniques are typically slow to act, expensive, and entail risks that are relatively familiar, such as the risk of carbon dioxide leakage from underground storage formations. In contrast, solar radiation management methods are fast-acting, comparatively cheap, and involve novel and more significant risks such as regional climate disruptions. As a result of these differing characteristics, the key governance problem for carbon dioxide removal (as with emissions reductions) is making sure actors do enough of it (the so-called \"[[free rider problem]]\"), whereas the key governance issue for solar radiation management is making sure actors do not do too much (the \"free driver\" problem).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/sjoe.12120 | volume=117 | issue=4 | title=A Voting Architecture for the Governance of Free-Driver Externalities, with Application to Geoengineering | journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Economics | pages=1049–1068 | last1 = Weitzman | first1 = Martin L.| year=2015 | url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:17368469 }}</ref>

Domestic and international governance vary by the proposed climate engineering method. There is presently a lack of a universally agreed framework for the regulation of either climate engineering activity or research. The [[London Convention (1972)|London Convention]] addresses some aspects of the law in relation to [[ocean fertilization]]. Scientists at the [[Oxford Martin School]] at [[Oxford University]] have proposed a set of voluntary principles, which may guide climate engineering research. The short version of the 'Oxford Principles'<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Rayner | first1 = S. | last2 = Heyward | first2 = C. | last3 = Kruger | first3 = T. | last4 = Pidgeon | first4 = N. | last5 = Redgwell | first5 = C. | last6 = Savulescu | first6 = J. | title = The Oxford Principles | doi = 10.1007/s10584-012-0675-2 | journal = Climatic Change | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 2013ClCh..121..499R | volume=121 | issue = 3 | pages=499–512}}</ref> is:
* Principle 1: Geoengineering to be regulated as a [[Public good (economics)|public good]].
* Principle 2: Public participation in geoengineering decision-making
* Principle 3: Disclosure of geoengineering research and [[open access publication|open publication]] of results
* Principle 4: Independent assessment of impacts
* Principle 5: Governance before deployment
These principles have been endorsed by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] Science and Technology [[Select Committee]] on \"The Regulation of Geoengineering\",<ref>{{Cite web|title = Oxford Geoengineering Programme // History of the Oxford Principles|url = http://www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk/oxford-principles/history/|website = www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-02-03|author=Oxford Geoengineering Programme}}</ref> and have been referred to by authors discussing the issue of governance.<ref name=\"economist.com\">{{Cite journal |url=https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2010/03/31/we-all-want-to-change-the-world |title=We all want to change the world |date=March 31, 2010 |journal=The Economist |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

The [[Asilomar conference]] was replicated to deal with the issue of climate engineering governance,<ref name=\"economist.com\"/> and covered in a [[TV documentary]], broadcast in Canada.

==Implementation issues==
There is general consensus{{Who|date=May 2017}} that no climate engineering technique is currently sufficiently safe or effective to greatly reduce climate change risks, for the reasons listed above. However, some may be able to contribute to reducing climate risks within relatively short times.

All proposed solar radiation management techniques require implementation on a relatively large scale, in order to impact the Earth's climate. The least costly proposals are budgeted at tens of billions of US dollars annually, or around 0.1% of world GDP.<ref name=\"Climate Intervention\"/> [[Space sunshade]]s would cost far more. Who was to bear the substantial costs of some climate engineering techniques may be hard to agree with. However, the more effective solar radiation management proposals currently appear to have low enough direct implementation costs that it would be in the interests of several single countries to implement them unilaterally.

In contrast, carbon dioxide removal, like greenhouse gas emissions reductions, have impacts proportional to their scale. These techniques would not be \"implemented\" in the same sense as solar radiation management ones. The problem structure of carbon dioxide removal resembles that of emissions cuts, in that both are somewhat expensive [[Public good (economics)|public goods]], whose provision presents a [[Collective action|collective action problem]].

Before they are ready to be used, most techniques would require technical development processes that are not yet in place. As a result, many promising proposed climate engineering do not yet have the engineering development or experimental evidence to determine their feasibility or efficacy.

==Public perception==
In a 2017 focus group study conducted by the [[Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences]] (CIRES) in the United States, Japan, New Zealand, and Sweden, participants were asked about carbon sequestration options, reflection proposals such as with space mirrors, or brightening of clouds, and their majority responses could be summed up as follows:
* What happens if the technologies backfire with unintended consequences?
* Are these solutions treating the symptoms of climate change rather than the cause?
* Shouldn't we just change our lifestyle and consumption patterns to fight climate change, making climate engineering a last resort?
* Isn't there a greater need to address political solutions to reduce our emissions?
Moderators floated then the idea of a future \"[[Global warming|climate emergency]]\" such as rapid environmental change. The participants felt that mitigation and adaptation to climate change were strongly preferred options in such a situation, and climate engineering was seen as a last resort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cires.colorado.edu/news/study-illuminates-public-perceptions-climate-engineering|date=October 9, 2017|title=Study Illuminates Public Perceptions of Climate Engineering|work=CIRES}}</ref>
Some extremists have proposed that there are secret government actions implementing geoengineering on a large scale, affecting weather to produce winter, or cooling, or large fires, or other detrimental effects.  There is no evidence to substantiate these unorthodox claims. Yet, search engines routinely link to these \"fake news\" and [[conspiracy theories]] sites.

==Evaluation of climate engineering==
Most of what is known about the suggested techniques are based on laboratory experiments, observations of natural phenomena, and on [[computer modeling]] techniques. Some proposed climate engineering methods employ methods that have analogs in natural phenomena such as [[stratospheric sulfur aerosols]] and [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. As such, studies about the efficacy of these methods can draw on information already available from other research, such as that following the [[1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo]]. However, comparative evaluation of the relative merits of each technology is complicated, especially given modeling uncertainties and the early stage of engineering development of many proposed climate engineering methods.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Geo-Engineering Inquiry|date=November 17, 2008|url=http://www.imeche.org/media/Public+Affairs/geoenginq.htm|website=Institution of Mechanical Engineers|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220180833/http://www.imeche.org/media/Public+Affairs/geoenginq.htm|archive-date=2008-12-20}}</ref>

Reports into climate engineering have also been published in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]<ref name=\"imeche09\"/> and the [[Royal Society]].<ref name=\"Royal Society Policy Document\"/> The IMechE report examined a small subset of proposed methods (air capture, urban albedo and algal-based {{co2}} capture techniques), and its main conclusions were that climate engineering should be researched and trialed at the small scale alongside a wider [[decarbonization]] of the economy.<ref name=\"imeche09\"/>

The Royal Society review examined a wide range of proposed climate engineering methods and evaluated them in terms of effectiveness, affordability, timeliness and safety (assigning [[qualitative data|qualitative]] estimates in each assessment). The report divided proposed methods into \"carbon dioxide removal\" (CDR) and \"solar radiation management\" (SRM) approaches that respectively address longwave and shortwave radiation. The key recommendations of the report were that \"Parties to the [[UNFCCC]] should make increased efforts towards mitigating and adapting to climate change, and in particular to agreeing to global emissions reductions\", and that \"[nothing] now known about climate engineering options gives any reason to diminish these efforts\".<ref name=\"Royal Society Policy Document\"/> Nonetheless, the report also recommended that \"research and development of climate engineering options should be undertaken to investigate whether low-risk methods can be made available if it becomes necessary to reduce the rate of warming this century\".<ref name=\"Royal Society Policy Document\"/>

In a 2009 review study, Lenton and Vaughan evaluated a range of proposed climate engineering techniques from those that sequester {{co2}} from the atmosphere and decrease [[outgoing longwave radiation|longwave radiation]] trapping, to those that decrease the Earth's receipt of [[shortwave radiation]].<ref name=\"lenton09\"/> In order to permit a comparison of disparate techniques, they used a common evaluation for each technique based on its effect on net radiative forcing. As such, the review examined the scientific plausibility of proposed methods rather than the practical considerations such as engineering feasibility or economic cost. Lenton and Vaughan found that \"[air] capture and storage shows the greatest potential, combined with afforestation, reforestation and bio-char production\", and noted that \"other suggestions that have received considerable media attention, in particular, \"ocean pipes\" appear to be ineffective\".<ref name=\"lenton09\"/> They concluded that \"[climate] geoengineering is best considered as a potential complement to the mitigation of {{co2}} emissions, rather than as an alternative to it\".<ref name=\"lenton09\"/>

In October 2011, a [[Bipartisan Policy Center]] panel issued a report urging immediate researching and testing in case \"the [[climate]] system reaches a 'tipping point' and swift remedial action is required\".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/science/earth/04climate.html \"Group Urges Research Into Aggressive Efforts to Fight Climate Change\"], October 4, 2011</ref>

===National Academy of Sciences===
The [[National Academy of Sciences]] conducted a 21-month project to study the potential impacts, benefits, and costs of two different types of climate engineering: carbon dioxide removal and albedo modification (solar radiation management). The differences between these two classes of  climate engineering \"led the committee to evaluate the two types of approaches separately in companion reports, a distinction it hopes carries over to future scientific and policy discussions.\"<ref name=\"www8.nationalacademies.org\">{{Cite press release|title = Climate Intervention Is Not a Replacement for Reducing Carbon Emissions; Proposed Intervention Techniques Not Ready for Wide-Scale Deployment|url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=02102015|website = NEWS from the national academies|date=Feb 10, 2015|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}</ref><ref name=\"Climate Intervention\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Council|first=National Research|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18805/climate-intervention-carbon-dioxide-removal-and-reliable-sequestration|title=Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration|date=2015|isbn=978-0-309-30529-7|language=en|doi=10.17226/18805}}</ref>

According to the two-volume study released in February 2015:<blockquote>Climate intervention is no substitute for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and adaptation efforts aimed at reducing the negative consequences of climate change. However, as our planet enters a period of changing climate never before experienced in recorded human history, interest is growing in the potential for deliberate intervention in the climate system to counter climate change. ...Carbon dioxide removal strategies address a key driver of climate change, but research is needed to fully assess if any of these technologies could be appropriate for large-scale deployment. Albedo modification strategies could rapidly cool the planet's surface but pose environmental and other risks that are not well understood and therefore should not be deployed at climate-altering scales; more research is needed to determine if albedo modification approaches could be viable in the future.<ref name=\"nas-sites.org\">{{Cite web|title = Climate Intervention Reports » Climate Change at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|url = https://nas-sites.org/americasclimatechoices/other-reports-on-climate-change/2015-2/climate-intervention-reports/|website = nas-sites.org|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}</ref></blockquote>The project was sponsored by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], U.S. Intelligence Community, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], [[NASA]], and [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]].<ref name=\"www8.nationalacademies.org\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www8.nationalacademies.org/pa/projectview.aspx?key=49540|title=Project|website=www8.nationalacademies.org|access-date=2019-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190930092222/https://www8.nationalacademies.org/pa/projectview.aspx?key=49540|archive-date=2019-09-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>

{{as of |2019|October}}, The National Academy of Sciences is working on a project, \"Developing a Research Agenda and Research Governance Approaches for Climate Intervention Strategies that Reflect Sunlight to Cool Earth.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Developing a Research Agenda and Research Governance Approaches for Climate Intervention Strategies that Reflect Sunlight to Cool Earth|url=https://www8.nationalacademies.org/pa/projectview.aspx?key=51415|website=Projects & Activities|publisher=The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine |access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref>

===Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change===

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) assessed the scientific literature on climate engineering (referred to as \"geoengineering\" in its reports), in which it considered carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation separately. Its [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] states:<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1|pp = 575, 632}}</ref>

<blockquote><poem>Models consistently suggest that SRM would generally reduce climate differences compared to a world with elevated GHG concentrations and no SRM; however, there would also be residual regional differences in climate (e.g., temperature and rainfall) when compared to a climate without elevated GHGs....

Models suggest that if SRM methods were realizable they would be effective in countering increasing temperatures, and would be less, but still, effective in countering some other climate changes. SRM would not counter all effects of climate change, and all proposed geoengineering methods also carry risks and side effects. Additional consequences cannot yet be anticipated as the level of scientific understanding about both SRM and CDR is low. There are also many (political, ethical, and practical) issues involving geoengineering that are beyond the scope of this report.</poem></blockquote>

[[File:Un-kashmir-jammu.png|thumb|right|UN map of Siachen]]

The Siachen Glacier is the highest battleground on earth,<ref>VAUSE, Mikel.  Peering Over the Edge: The Philosophy of Mountaineering, p. 194.</ref><ref>CHILD, Greg.  Mixed Emotions: Mountaineering Writings, p. 147.</ref> where [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] have fought intermittently since 13 April 1984. Both countries maintain a permanent military presence in the region at a height of over {{convert|6000|m}}. More than 2000 people have died in this inhospitable terrain, mostly due to weather extremes and the natural hazards of [[mountain warfare]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The conflict in Siachen stems from the incompletely demarcated territory on the map beyond the map coordinate known as [[NJ9842]] ({{Coord|35.008371|77.008805}}). The 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] and 1972 [[Simla Agreement]] did not clearly mention who controlled the glacier, merely stating that the Cease Fire Line (CFL) terminated at NJ9842.<ref name=\":0\" /> UN officials presumed there would be no dispute between India and Pakistan over such a cold and barren region.<ref>Modern world history- Chapter-The Indian subcontinent achieves independence/The Coldest War.</ref>

===Paragraph B 2 (d) of Karachi Agreement===
Following the UN-mediated ceasefire in 1949, the line between India and Pakistan was demarcated up to point NJ9842 at the foot of the Siachen Glacier. The largely inaccessible terrain beyond this point was not demarcated,<ref name=\":0\" /> but delimited as '''thence north to the glaciers''' in paragraph B 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.

Paragraph B 2 (d) of 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] states:
{{quotation| (d) From Dalunang eastwards the cease-fire line will follow the general line point 15495, Ishman, Manus, Gangam, Gunderman, Point 13620, Funkar (Point 17628), Marmak, Natsara, Shangruti (Point 1,531), Chorbat La (Point 16700), Chalunka (on the Shyok River), Khor, '''thence north to the glaciers'''. This portion of the cease-fire line shall be demarcated in detail on the basis of the factual position as of 27 July 1949, by the local commanders assisted by United Nations military observers.}}

Later, following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and the [[Simla Agreement]] in July 1972, the ceasefire line was converted into the \"Line of Control\" extending from the \"''Chhamb sector on the international border [to] the Turtok-Partapur sector in the north.''\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The detailed description of its northern end stated that from Chimbatia in the Turtok sector ''\"the line of control runs north-eastwards to Thang (inclusive to India), thence eastwards joining the glaciers.\"'' This vague formulation further sowed the seed for the bitter dispute to follow.<ref name=\":0\" />  The general description of CFL given in Section 1 of Karachi Agreement is further explained at Page 38 where it states:<blockquote>''\"thence northwards along the boundary line going through Point 18402 up to NJ-9842\"''<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author1=P R Chari|author2=Pervaiz Iqbal Cheema|author3=Stephen P Cohen|title=Perception, Politics and Security in South Asia: The Compound Crisis of 1990 (2003)|publisher=Routledge (London); 1 edition (May 16, 2003)|isbn=978-0415307970|page=53|edition=2003|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AW3zXB85gNoC&lpg=PA61&dq=none+of+these+explanations+are+mutually+exclusive+and+none+seem+to+fully+explain+the+onset&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=true|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=2 September 2003}}</ref></blockquote> The [[United Nations|U.N.]] document number S/1430/Add.2.<ref>{{cite web|title=UN Map showing CFL – UN document number S/1430/Add.2|url=http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|website=Dag Digital Library|accessdate=30 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118155050/http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|archive-date=18 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> is the second [[addendum]] to the 1949 Karachi Agreement, and shows the CFL marked on the Map of the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] as per the explanation of CFL in paragraph 'B' 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.

=== Oropolitics ===
In 1949, a Cease-Fire Line Agreement (CFL) was signed and ratified by India, Pakistan and the UN Military Observer Group that delineated the entire CFL. In 1956–58, a scientific team led by the [[Geological Survey of India]] recorded its findings publicly including information about the Siachen and other glaciers.<ref name=\"tribune\" />

After Pakistan ceded the {{cvt|5180|sqkm|adj=on}} [[Shaksgam Valley]] to China in a boundary agreement in 1963, Pakistan started giving approval to western expeditions to the east of [[K2|mountain K2]].<ref name=tribune>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120421/edit.htm Facts vs bluff on Siachen, Kayani's suggestion worth pursuing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422175121/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120421/edit.htm |date=22 April 2012 }}, B.G. Verghese, Saturday, 21 April 2012, Chandigarh, India</ref> In 1957 Pakistan permitted a British expedition under [[Eric Shipton]] to approach the Siachen glacier through the Bilafond La, and recce [[Saltoro Kangri]].<ref>Himalayan Journal Vol. 21</ref> Five years later a Japanese-Pakistani expedition put two Japanese and a Pakistani Army climber on top of [[Saltoro Kangri]].<ref>Himalayan Journal Vol. 25</ref> These were early moves in this particular game of [[oropolitics]].

In the 1970s and early 1980s several [[mountaineering]] expeditions applied to Pakistan to climb high peaks in the Siachen area due in part to US Defense Mapping Agency and most other maps and atlases showing it on the Pakistani side of the line. Pakistan granted a number of permits. This, in turn, reinforced the Pakistani claim on the area, as these expeditions arrived on the glacier with a permit obtained from the [[Government of Pakistan]]. [[Teram Kangri]] I ({{convert|7465|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Teram Kangri]] II ({{convert|7406|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) were climbed in 1975 by a Japanese expedition led by H. Katayama, which approached through Pakistan via the Bilafond La.<ref>SANGAKU 71</ref>

In 1978 a German Siachen-Kondus Expedition under the leadership of Jaroslav Poncar (further members Volker Stallbohm and Wolfgang Kohl, liaison officer major Asad Raza) entered Siachen via Bilafond La and established the base camp on the confluence of Siachen and Teram Shehr. The documentary \"Expedition to the longest glacier\" was shown on the 3rd channel of WDR (German TV) in 1979.

Prior to 1984 neither India nor Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. Having become aware of the US military maps and the permit incidents, [[Colonel Narendra Kumar]], then commanding officer of the Indian Army's [[High Altitude Warfare School]], mounted an Army expedition to the Siachen area as a counter-exercise. In 1978 this expedition climbed [[Teram Kangri]] II, claiming it as a first ascent in a typical \"oropolitical\" riposte. Unusually for the normally secretive Indian Army, the news and photographs of this expedition were published in [[The Illustrated Weekly of India]], a widely circulated popular magazine.<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1912811/coldest-war|title=Outside magazine article about Siachen battleground |publisher=Outsideonline.com |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref>

==Military expeditions==

In 1977, an Indian colonel named [[Narendra Kumar (mountaineer)|Narendra Kumar]], offended by international expeditions venturing onto the glacier from the Pakistani side, persuaded his superiors to allow him to lead a 70-man team of climbers and porters to the glacier.<ref name=\":1\" /> They returned in or around 1981, climbed several peaks and walked the length of Siachen.

==Major combat operations==

At army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the discovery of repeated Indian military expeditions to the glacier drove Pakistani generals to the idea of securing Siachen before India did. This operation was called [[Operation Ababeel]]. In the haste to pull together operational resources, Pakistan planners made a tactical error, according to a now-retired Pakistani army colonel. \"They ordered Arctic-weather gear from a London outfitter who also supplied the Indians,\" says the colonel. \"Once the Indians got wind of it, they ordered 300 outfits—twice as many as we had—and rushed their men up to Siachen\". The acquisition of key supplies needed for operations in glaciated zones marked the start of major combat operations on the glacier.<ref name=\"story\"/> [[File:Dogra Siachen.jpg|thumb|right|A memorial at the headquarters of the [[Dogra Regiment]] of the Indian Army in remembrance of members of the regiment who died or served in the Siachen Conflict.]]

April 1984 [[Operation Meghdoot]]: Indian Army under the leadership of Lt. Gen. [[Manohar Lal Chibber]], Maj. Gen. Shiv Sharma, and Lt. Gen. [[Prem Nath Hoon|P. N. Hoon]] learned of the plan by Pakistan Army to seize Sia La, and Bilafond La, on the glacier. Indian Army launched an operation to preempt the seizure of the passes by the Pakistan Army.  Men of the Ladakh Scouts and [[Kumaon Regiment]] occupy Bilafond La on 13 April and Sia La on 17 April 1984 with the help of the [[Indian Air Force]]. Pakistan Army, in turn, learned of the presence of Ladakh Scouts on the passes during a helicopter recon mission. In response to these developments, Pakistan Army initiated an operation using troops from the Special Services Group and Northern Light Infantry to displace the three hundred or so Indian troops on the key passes. This operation led by the Pakistan Army led to the first armed clash on the glacier on 25 April 1984.<ref name=\"India Defence Review D.P.

June – July 1987: [[Operation Rajiv]]: Over the next three years, with Indian troops positioned at the critical passes, Pakistan Army attempted to seize heights overlooking the passes.

This feature was named \"Qaid Post\" and for three years it dominated Indian positions on the glacier. Pakistani Army held Qaid post overlooked Bilafond La area and offered an excellent vantage point to view Indian Army activities. On 25 June 1987 Indian Army under the leadership of Brig. Gen.

In the book ''Asymmetric Warfare in South Asia: The Causes and Consequences of the Kargil Conflict'', Khan, Lavoy and Clary wrote: <blockquote>The Pakistan army sees India's 1984 occupation of the Siachen Glacier as a major scar, outweighed only by Dhaka's fall in 1971. The event underscored the dilution of the Simla Agreement and became a domestic issue as political parties, led by Benazir Bhutto's Peoples Party, blamed an incompetent military government under Zia ul-Haq for failing to defend Pakistani-held territory — while Zia downplayed the significance of the loss.{{sfn|Lavoy|2009|p=75}}</blockquote>

General [[Ved Prakash Malik]], in his book ''Kargil from Surprise to Victory'', wrote: <blockquote>Siachen is considered a military setback by the Pakistan Army. That the Indians dominate the area from the Saltoro Ridge and Pakistani troops are nowhere near the Siachen Glacier is a fact never mentioned in public. The perceived humiliation at Siachen manifests itself in many ways. It is synonymous with Indian perfidy and a violation of the [[Shimla Agreement]]... In Pakistan, Siachen is a subject that hurts, just like a thorn in its flesh; it is also a psychological drain on the Pakistani Army. [[Pervez Musharraf]] had himself once commanded the [[Special Services Group]] (SSG) troops in this area and made several futile attempts to capture Indian posts.{{sfn|Malik|2006|p=54}}</blockquote>

==Severe conditions==
A cease-fire went into effect in 2003.  Even before then, every year more soldiers were killed because of severe weather than enemy firing. The two sides by 2003 had lost an estimated 2,000 personnel primarily due to [[frostbite]], [[avalanches]] and other complications.  Together, the nations have about 150 manned outposts along the glacier, with some 3,000 troops each.

==Causes==

[[File:Un-kashmir-jammu.png|thumb|right|UN map of Siachen]]

The Siachen Glacier is the highest battleground on earth,<ref>VAUSE, Mikel.  Peering Over the Edge: The Philosophy of Mountaineering, p. 194.</ref><ref>CHILD, Greg.  Mixed Emotions: Mountaineering Writings, p. 147.</ref> where [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] have fought intermittently since 13 April 1984. Both countries maintain a permanent military presence in the region at a height of over {{convert|6000|m}}. More than 2000 people have died in this inhospitable terrain, mostly due to weather extremes and the natural hazards of [[mountain warfare]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The conflict in Siachen stems from the incompletely demarcated territory on the map beyond the map coordinate known as [[NJ9842]] ({{Coord|35.008371|77.008805}}). The 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] and 1972 [[Simla Agreement]] did not clearly mention who controlled the glacier, merely stating that the Cease Fire Line (CFL) terminated at NJ9842.<ref name=\":0\" /> UN officials presumed there would be no dispute between India and Pakistan over such a cold and barren region.<ref>Modern world history- Chapter-The Indian subcontinent achieves independence/The Coldest War.</ref>

===Paragraph B 2 (d) of Karachi Agreement===
Following the UN-mediated ceasefire in 1949, the line between India and Pakistan was demarcated up to point NJ9842 at the foot of the Siachen Glacier. The largely inaccessible terrain beyond this point was not demarcated,<ref name=\":0\" /> but delimited as '''thence north to the glaciers''' in paragraph B 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.

Paragraph B 2 (d) of 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] states:
{{quotation| (d) From Dalunang eastwards the cease-fire line will follow the general line point 15495, Ishman, Manus, Gangam, Gunderman, Point 13620, Funkar (Point 17628), Marmak, Natsara, Shangruti (Point 1,531), Chorbat La (Point 16700), Chalunka (on the Shyok River), Khor, '''thence north to the glaciers'''. This portion of the cease-fire line shall be demarcated in detail on the basis of the factual position as of 27 July 1949, by the local commanders assisted by United Nations military observers.}}

Later, following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and the [[Simla Agreement]] in July 1972, the ceasefire line was converted into the \"Line of Control\" extending from the \"''Chhamb sector on the international border [to] the Turtok-Partapur sector in the north.''\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The detailed description of its northern end stated that from Chimbatia in the Turtok sector ''\"the line of control runs north-eastwards to Thang (inclusive to India), thence eastwards joining the glaciers.\"'' This vague formulation further sowed the seed for the bitter dispute to follow.<ref name=\":0\" />  The general description of CFL given in Section 1 of Karachi Agreement is further explained at Page 38 where it states:<blockquote>''\"thence northwards along the boundary line going through Point 18402 up to NJ-9842\"''<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author1=P R Chari|author2=Pervaiz Iqbal Cheema|author3=Stephen P Cohen|title=Perception, Politics and Security in South Asia: The Compound Crisis of 1990 (2003)|publisher=Routledge (London); 1 edition (May 16, 2003)|isbn=978-0415307970|page=53|edition=2003|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AW3zXB85gNoC&lpg=PA61&dq=none+of+these+explanations+are+mutually+exclusive+and+none+seem+to+fully+explain+the+onset&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=true|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=2 September 2003}}</ref></blockquote> The [[United Nations|U.N.]] document number S/1430/Add.2.<ref>{{cite web|title=UN Map showing CFL – UN document number S/1430/Add.2|url=http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|website=Dag Digital Library|accessdate=30 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118155050/http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|archive-date=18 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> is the second [[addendum]] to the 1949 Karachi Agreement, and shows the CFL marked on the Map of the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] as per the explanation of CFL in paragraph 'B' 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.

=== Oropolitics ===
In 1949, a Cease-Fire Line Agreement (CFL) was signed and ratified by India, Pakistan and the UN Military Observer Group that delineated the entire CFL. In 1956–58, a scientific team led by the [[Geological Survey of India]] recorded its findings publicly including information about the Siachen and other glaciers.<ref name=\"tribune\" />

After Pakistan ceded the {{cvt|5180|sqkm|adj=on}} [[Shaksgam Valley]] to China in a boundary agreement in 1963, Pakistan started giving approval to western expeditions to the east of [[K2|mountain K2]].<ref name=tribune>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120421/edit.htm Facts vs bluff on Siachen, Kayani's suggestion worth pursuing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422175121/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120421/edit.htm |date=22 April 2012 }}, B.G. Verghese, Saturday, 21 April 2012, Chandigarh, India</ref> In 1957 Pakistan permitted a British expedition under [[Eric Shipton]] to approach the Siachen glacier through the Bilafond La, and recce [[Saltoro Kangri]].<ref>Himalayan Journal Vol. 21</ref> Five years later a Japanese-Pakistani expedition put two Japanese and a Pakistani Army climber on top of [[Saltoro Kangri]].<ref>Himalayan Journal Vol. 25</ref> These were early moves in this particular game of [[oropolitics]].

In the 1970s and early 1980s several [[mountaineering]] expeditions applied to Pakistan to climb high peaks in the Siachen area due in part to US Defense Mapping Agency and most other maps and atlases showing it on the Pakistani side of the line. Pakistan granted a number of permits. This, in turn, reinforced the Pakistani claim on the area, as these expeditions arrived on the glacier with a permit obtained from the [[Government of Pakistan]]. [[Teram Kangri]] I ({{convert|7465|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Teram Kangri]] II ({{convert|7406|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) were climbed in 1975 by a Japanese expedition led by H. Katayama, which approached through Pakistan via the Bilafond La.<ref>SANGAKU 71</ref>

In 1978 a German Siachen-Kondus Expedition under the leadership of Jaroslav Poncar (further members Volker Stallbohm and Wolfgang Kohl, liaison officer major Asad Raza) entered Siachen via Bilafond La and established the base camp on the confluence of Siachen and Teram Shehr. The documentary \"Expedition to the longest glacier\" was shown on the 3rd channel of WDR (German TV) in 1979.

Prior to 1984 neither India nor Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. Having become aware of the US military maps and the permit incidents, [[Colonel Narendra Kumar]], then commanding officer of the Indian Army's [[High Altitude Warfare School]], mounted an Army expedition to the Siachen area as a counter-exercise.

==Military expeditions==

In 1977, an Indian colonel named [[Narendra Kumar (mountaineer)|Narendra Kumar]], offended by international expeditions venturing onto the glacier from the Pakistani side, persuaded his superiors to allow him to lead a 70-man team of climbers and porters to the glacier.<ref name=\":1\" /> They returned in or around 1981, climbed several peaks and walked the length of Siachen.

==Major combat operations==

At army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the discovery of repeated Indian military expeditions to the glacier drove Pakistani generals to the idea of securing Siachen before India did. This operation was called [[Operation Ababeel]]. In the haste to pull together operational resources, Pakistan planners made a tactical error, according to a now-retired Pakistani army colonel. \"They ordered Arctic-weather gear from a London outfitter who also supplied the Indians,\" says the colonel. \"Once the Indians got wind of it, they ordered 300 outfits—twice as many as we had—and rushed their men up to Siachen\". The acquisition of key supplies needed for operations in glaciated zones marked the start of major combat operations on the glacier.<ref name=\"story\"/> [[File:Dogra Siachen.jpg|thumb|right|A memorial at the headquarters of the [[Dogra Regiment]] of the Indian Army in remembrance of members of the regiment who died or served in the Siachen Conflict.]]

April 1984 [[Operation Meghdoot]]: Indian Army under the leadership of Lt. Gen. [[Manohar Lal Chibber]], Maj. Gen. Shiv Sharma, and Lt. Gen. [[Prem Nath Hoon|P. N. Hoon]] learned of the plan by Pakistan Army to seize Sia La, and Bilafond La, on the glacier. Indian Army launched an operation to preempt the seizure of the passes by the Pakistan Army.  Men of the Ladakh Scouts and [[Kumaon Regiment]] occupy Bilafond La on 13 April and Sia La on 17 April 1984 with the help of the [[Indian Air Force]]. Pakistan Army, in turn, learned of the presence of Ladakh Scouts on the passes during a helicopter recon mission. In response to these developments, Pakistan Army initiated an operation using troops from the Special Services Group and Northern Light Infantry to displace the three hundred or so Indian troops on the key passes. This operation led by the Pakistan Army led to the first armed clash on the glacier on 25 April 1984.<ref name=\"India Defence Review D.P.

June – July 1987: [[Operation Rajiv]]: Over the next three years, with Indian troops positioned at the critical passes, Pakistan Army attempted to seize heights overlooking the passes. One of the biggest successes achieved by Pakistan in this period was the seizure of a feature overlooking Bilafond La. This feature was named \"Qaid Post\" and for three years it dominated Indian positions on the glacier. Pakistani Army held Qaid post overlooked Bilafond La area and offered an excellent vantage point to view Indian Army activities. On 25 June 1987 Indian Army under the leadership of Brig. Gen.

In the book ''Asymmetric Warfare in South Asia: The Causes and Consequences of the Kargil Conflict'', Khan, Lavoy and Clary wrote: <blockquote>The Pakistan army sees India's 1984 occupation of the Siachen Glacier as a major scar, outweighed only by Dhaka's fall in 1971. The event underscored the dilution of the Simla Agreement and became a domestic issue as political parties, led by Benazir Bhutto's Peoples Party, blamed an incompetent military government under Zia ul-Haq for failing to defend Pakistani-held territory — while Zia downplayed the significance of the loss.{{sfn|Lavoy|2009|p=75}}</blockquote>

General [[Ved Prakash Malik]], in his book ''Kargil from Surprise to Victory'', wrote: <blockquote>Siachen is considered a military setback by the Pakistan Army. That the Indians dominate the area from the Saltoro Ridge and Pakistani troops are nowhere near the Siachen Glacier is a fact never mentioned in public. The perceived humiliation at Siachen manifests itself in many ways. It is synonymous with Indian perfidy and a violation of the [[Shimla Agreement]]... In Pakistan, Siachen is a subject that hurts, just like a thorn in its flesh; it is also a psychological drain on the Pakistani Army. [[Pervez Musharraf]] had himself once commanded the [[Special Services Group]] (SSG) troops in this area and made several futile attempts to capture Indian posts.{{sfn|Malik|2006|p=54}}</blockquote>

==Severe conditions==
A cease-fire went into effect in 2003.  Even before then, every year more soldiers were killed because of severe weather than enemy firing. The two sides by 2003 had lost an estimated 2,000 personnel primarily due to [[frostbite]], [[avalanches]] and other complications.  Together, the nations have about 150 manned outposts along the glacier, with some 3,000 troops each.  Official figures for maintaining these outposts are put at ~$300 and ~$200&nbsp;million for India and Pakistan respectively. India built the world's highest [[helipad]] on the glacier at [[Point Sonam]], 21,000 feet (6,400&nbsp;m) above the sea level, to supply its troops. The problems of reinforcing or evacuating the high-altitude ridgeline have led to India's development of the [[Advanced Light Helicopter|Dhruv]] Mk III helicopter, powered by the [[Shakti engine]], which was flight-tested to lift and land personnel and stores from the [[Sonam post]], the highest permanently manned post in the world.<ref>{{cite news|last = Shukla|first = Ajai|url = http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|title = In Siachen, Dhruv proves a world-beater|date = 20 January 2013|origyear = First published 7 March 2011|journal = Business Standard|place = New Delhi|access-date = 7 March 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806070753/http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|archive-date = 6 August 2011|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> India also installed the world's highest [[telephone booth]] on the glacier.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html |accessdate=11 September 2008 |url-status=dead |origyear= Published 9 November 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222017/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html|journal = Denver Rocky Mountain News|archivedate=14 July 2014|title = India Installs World's Highest Phone Booth Soldiers Fighting Along Kashmir Glacier Can Now Call Families, Army Says}}</ref>
