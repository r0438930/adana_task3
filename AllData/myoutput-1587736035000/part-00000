{"title_page": "1927 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Short description|Rugby league season}}\nThe 1927 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was its 18th.\n\n[[Newton Rangers|Newton]] defeated [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] by 6 points to 3 in the championship final to win the Monteith Shield after both teams finished the season tied with identical 8 win, 1 draw, 3 loss records. This was the second time Newton had won the championship in 18 efforts, with the first being in [[1912 Auckland Rugby League season|1912and]] was to be their last after they merged decades later with [[City Rovers]] and the combined team ceased in the early 2000s. [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] won the Roope Rooster knockout trophy for the second consecutive season. [[Newton Rangers]] defeated [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] to win the Stormont Shield.\n\n[[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won the Norton Cup by winning the second division competition, known as the B Grade at this time. They were undefeated and also won the Stallard Cup which was the B Grade knockout trophy. Interestingly the league played a 'promotion-relegation' match, with [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] by virtue of winning the Norton Cup for winning the B Grade playing off with [[Grafton Athletic|Grafton]], who had finished last in the A Grade. [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won 11\u20133 over Grafton thus winning the right to compete in the A grade competition in the 1928 season. Despite this there was still considerable discussion at the annual general meeting the following year as to whether or not [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] be admitted to the A Grade. It was eventually decided that they would be, with [[Grafton Athletic|Grafton]] dropping to the B Grade.\n\nOther trophies awarded (at the 1928 annual general meeting of the [[Auckland Rugby League]]) were the Davis Points Shield to [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]], the Thistle Cup to [[Newton Rangers|Newton]], and a special cup for the best forward to W.Clark from [[Newton Rangers|Newton]].\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1926 Auckland Rugby League season|1926]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=18th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1927}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1928 Auckland Rugby League season|1928]]}}\n    {{end}}\n\n=== Annual Meetings of Auckland Rugby League ===\nThe annual report for the 1927 season stated that the total revenue for [[Auckland Rugby League]] was \u00a35,597, with \u00a34,216 taken at the gates.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Review of Past Season/Total Revenue of \u00a35597\n| page = 13\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXIV| issue=19580\n| date = 1927-03-08\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19270308.2.149.3\n| accessdate = 2019-09-23}}</ref> At the annual meeting of the Junior Management Committee of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] on 23 March it was stated in their report that junior players exceeded 1,500. It was also reported that the Remuera League Club was being revived.

It was notable for the fact that 4 players were ordered off. St George who had had words with the referee was sent from the field, two minutes later Stewart from [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] joined him and Prentice (Richmond), and O'Brien (Devonport) soon followed.\n\nIn Round 9 the match between [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] at the [[Auckland Domain]] was postponed due to the ground being unfit for play. In the same round the [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] captain O'Brien was ordered off in their 16\u20136 loss to [[Marist Saints|Marist]]. At the conclusion of the match the referee was escorted from the field by two police officers as several hecklers crowded and heckled him. The following weekend saw all games suspended and the postponed match played at [[Carlaw Park]], with [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] defeating [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] by 14 points to 3. Ironically rain fell throughout the match and the field \"was badly churned up as the game progressed\".<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Creates Surprise/Ponsonby Team Defeated/Fine Work by Forwards\n| page = 13\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXIV| issue=19685\n| date = 1927-07-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19270711.2.145.13\n| accessdate = 2019-09-25}}</ref>\n\nIn Round 10 the match between [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] and Grafton was cancelled due to the unfit nature of the field at the Auckland Domain. It was played on the following weekend at [[Devonport, New Zealand|Devonport]] with other fixtures from that round not played due to the [[Auckland Rugby League]] making [[Carlaw Park]] available for the soccer match between [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] and [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]].\n\nAfter two completed rounds [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] were both tied on 19 competition points. This necessitated a final between the two sides and this was won by [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] by 6 points to 3. The Roope Rooster finalists were [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] and [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]]. [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] won the final 7 points to 6 to retain the title. In the Stormont Shield match played between the winners of the two major titles ([[Newton Rangers|Newton]] and [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]]), [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] won by 25 points to 14.\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | 1927 First Grade Results\n|-\n|\n!

This was the second time Newton had won the championship in 18 efforts, with the first being in [[1912 Auckland Rugby League season|1912and]] was to be their last after they merged decades later with [[City Rovers]] and the combined team ceased in the early 2000s. [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] won the Roope Rooster knockout trophy for the second consecutive season. [[Newton Rangers]] defeated [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] to win the Stormont Shield.\n\n[[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won the Norton Cup by winning the second division competition, known as the B Grade at this time. They were undefeated and also won the Stallard Cup which was the B Grade knockout trophy. Interestingly the league played a 'promotion-relegation' match, with [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] by virtue of winning the Norton Cup for winning the B Grade playing off with [[Grafton Athletic|Grafton]], who had finished last in the A Grade. [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won 11\u20133 over Grafton thus winning the right to compete in the A grade competition in the 1928 season. Despite this there was still considerable discussion at the annual general meeting the following year as to whether or not [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] be admitted to the A Grade. It was eventually decided that they would be, with [[Grafton Athletic|Grafton]] dropping to the B Grade.\n\nOther trophies awarded (at the 1928 annual general meeting of the [[Auckland Rugby League]]) were the Davis Points Shield to [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]], the Thistle Cup to [[Newton Rangers|Newton]], and a special cup for the best forward to W.Clark from [[Newton Rangers|Newton]].\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1926 Auckland Rugby League season|1926]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=18th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1927}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1928 Auckland Rugby League season|1928]]}}\n    {{end}}\n\n=== Annual Meetings of Auckland Rugby League ===\nThe annual report for the 1927 season stated that the total revenue for [[Auckland Rugby League]] was \u00a35,597, with \u00a34,216 taken at the gates.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Review of Past Season/Total Revenue of \u00a35597\n| page = 13\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXIV| issue=19580\n| date = 1927-03-08\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19270308.2.149.3\n| accessdate = 2019-09-23}}</ref> At the annual meeting of the Junior Management Committee of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] on 23 March it was stated in their report that junior players exceeded 1,500.

It was played on the following weekend at [[Devonport, New Zealand|Devonport]] with other fixtures from that round not played due to the [[Auckland Rugby League]] making [[Carlaw Park]] available for the soccer match between [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] and [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]].\n\nAfter two completed rounds [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] were both tied on 19 competition points. This necessitated a final between the two sides and this was won by [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] by 6 points to 3. The Roope Rooster finalists were [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] and [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]]. [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] won the final 7 points to 6 to retain the title.
