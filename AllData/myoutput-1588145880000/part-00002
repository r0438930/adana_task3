He has played off and on with The Doobie Brothers for 50 years, in several styles.\n\n==Musical career==\nJohnston is most well known for both his lead guitar and vocal role in [[The Doobie Brothers]], as well as for his adaptation of his own acoustic guitar style, blending a unique strum and percussive accented rhythm at the same time on one instrument. This style, interwoven with melodic [[hammer-on]]s ({{YouTube|id=LtuAZ57cuLA#t=8|title=Example Early Johnston Riff and Vocal}}) gave Johnston an early signature sound inside of popular 1970s rock music.

After brief school stints with the saxophone and clarinet, at the age of twelve Johnston took up guitar. He said, \"I started out [on] the clarinet at seven, and I played that for eight years. I also played the saxophone for three years, drums for a year and a half, and took up the guitar when I was in the seventh grade. That was pretty much of a rebellion/image trip.

But unfortunately, when I hung the clarinet up, I hung up all the reed instruments and just started playing guitar, and I never touched them again. I taught myself guitar and a little piano at home.

It was there that he met [[Skip Spence]], a former drummer with [[Jefferson Airplane]], and guitarist/founding member of a group that had a major influence on the Doobie Brothers \u2013 [[Moby Grape]]. Spence introduced Johnston to John Hartman. Johnston was a graphic design art major at [[San Jos\u00e9 State University]] and wound up living at 285 South 12th Street, which was a musical center for San Jose at the time. \"It didn't matter if they played B-3 or drums, guitar, bass, or horns, they all ended up in our basement,\" Johnston recalls. Johnston and Hartman soon formed their own band, Pud, featuring Greg Murphy on bass. Pud played many [[nightclub|clubs]] in and around San Jose, including the Golden Horn Lounge (which no longer exists) in [[Cupertino, California]]. Here they met [[Patrick Simmons|Pat Simmons]]. Hartman and Johnston lived in the 12th Street house for about four years; whereupon Dave Shogren joined them to replace Greg Murphy and Pat Simmons was recruited, they had the nucleus of a new band, and Pud gave way to [[The Doobie Brothers]].<ref name=\"gm120804\"/>\n\nThroughout much of an initial seven-year and six-album discography, Johnston wrote and sang many of The Doobie Brothers' early [[hit record|hits]], including \"[[Listen to the Music]]\" (#11 Top 100 Billboard Hit \u22121972), \"Rockin' Down the Highway,\" \"[[China Grove (song)|China Grove]]\" (#15 Billboard Hot 100 Hit), \"[[Long Train Runnin']]\" (#8 Billboard Hot 100 Hit), \"Another Park, Another Sunday\" (#32 Billboard Hot 100 Hit), and \"Eyes of Silver\" (#52 Billboard Hot 100 Hit).

Johnston's condition was so precarious that he required emergency hospitalization for a bleeding ulcer. With Johnston convalescing and the tour already underway, fellow Doobie Brother Jeff Baxter proposed recruiting a fellow Steely Dan alum to fill the hole.<ref name=\"The Doobie Brothers\">[[The Doobie Brothers]]</ref> This led to the emergency hiring of [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]], who became the lead singer of the band. Restored to fitness in 1976 and briefly back in the band, Johnston contributed one original song to ''Takin' It to the Streets'' (\"Turn It Loose\"), and also added a vocal [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] to Pat Simmons' tune \"Wheels of Fortune\". He also made live appearances with the band in 1976 (appearing in a concert filmed that year at the Winterland in San Francisco, excerpts from which appear occasionally on [[VH1 Classic]]), but was sidelined once again in the fall due to exhaustion. None of Johnston's songs appeared on ''Livin' on the Fault Line'', though he had written and the band had recorded five of his compositions for the album. Finally, before ''Fault Line'' was released, Johnston had his songs removed and left the band that he co-founded (though he received credit for guitars and vocals and was pictured on the album's inner sleeve band photo).<ref name=\"The Doobie Brothers\"/> After a few years of restored health but growing differences in musical direction between band members, Johnston finally left the band in 1977 to pursue a solo career that produced two albums with Warner Bros: ''Everything You've Heard Is True'' and ''Still Feels Good'' (reissued on compact disc by [[Wounded Bird Records]]), and Billboard Hot 100 hit \"Savannah Nights\" (#34 Top 100 Billboard Hit \u22121980).<ref name=\"Shasho\"/>\n\nJohnston toured in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the Tom Johnston Band, which featured fellow Doobie John Hartman on drums. While working on his solo projects, in 1982 Johnston rejoined the band for a [[farewell tour]] concert, after which The Doobie Brothers ceased performing as a band for the next five years.\n\nIn 1985, Johnston toured US clubs with a group called Border Patrol, that also included former Doobies [[Michael Hossack]] and briefly Patrick Simmons. This group toured but never recorded. In 1987, he contributed a tune to the ''[[Dirty Dancing (soundtrack)|Dirty Dancing]]'' soundtrack entitled \"Where Are You Tonight?\"\n\n===Current years 1987\u2013present===\n[[File:Tom johnston and guitar mates.JPG|thumb|left|Doobie Brothers (Pat Simmons and John McFee, incl.) performing together]]\n\nJohnston joined the Doobie Brothers when they reunited for a brief tour in 1987 to benefit The National Veterans Foundation.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} This event led to the permanent reformation of the band, with Johnston again performing alongside co-founder Simmons. Johnston co-wrote, sang and contributed a signature guitar solo to the group's last major chart hit, \"The Doctor\" (from 1989's ''[[Cycles (The Doobie Brothers album)|Cycles]]'').{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} This was followed by the album ''Brotherhood'' in 1991 which featured four songs by Johnston, and ''Sibling Rivalry'' in 2000 featuring the single \"People Gotta Love Again\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Doobies' most recent album, 2010's ''World Gone Crazy'', features 13 songs, eight of which were written by Johnston including the album's title track and the first single \"Nobody\", a rerecording of the band's first single in 1971.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Road and studio gear outfitting==\n\"Mine [first guitar] was an arch-back Harmony acoustic with f-holes.

He started with a [[Gibson J-45#Gibson J-50|Gibson J-50]] which was used to record all acoustic guitar parts on the first four Doobie Brother albums and after it was stolen moved to Martin guitars.

He said, \"I use my little finger to play chords, but not for playing solos. The direction in which I bend a string depends on where the string I'm bending is on the neck. The lower strings are going to be pulled down, and the high strings are going to be pushed up. I use a lot of vibrato when I play solo. And for picking, it has to be up and down if you want to do a lot of speed. It's also better for clarity. Anything faster than quarter notes, you either have to use alternating picking or play with a regular flatpick and fingers.\"<ref name=\"Menn\"/>\n\nJohnston has traditionally employed Herco Nylon Flex 50 flatpicks (old \"Herco mediums\"),<ref>https://www.jimdunlop.com/product/he210p-7-10137-01950-8</ref>{{failed verification|date=January 2019}} allowing for the right combination of flex and durability for his chukka-style rhythm. He said \"I always use Herco medium because they don't break, and they take forever to wear out. Actually the worst thing you can do with a Herco is lose it. They are easy to hold on to as well and I do sweat a lot playing live. In fact, I usually eat the nickel off the strings right down to the brass (circa 1976).\"<ref name=\"Menn\"/>\n\nIn 2007<ref name=\"News\"/> C.F.

He also sang the hit song \"Take Me in Your Arms\" (#11 Billboard Hot 100 Hit \u22121975) (written by [[Holland-Dozier-Holland]]).<ref name=\"Shasho\">{{cite web|last=Shasho|first=Ray|title=Tom Johnston Interview: Doobie Brothers timelessly rockin\u2019 down the highway|url=https://bestclassicbands.com/doobie-brothers-interview-2-2-166/|work=Arts & Entertainment/Music|publisher=examiner.com|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Mid and solo years 1976\u20131987===\n[[File:Tommy J Acoustic TfT.jpg|thumb|left|Tommy Johnston Toys for Tots Concert Atlanta, Georgia Dec 1980]]\n\nIn December 1973, the British music magazine ''[[NME]]'' reported the relatively trivial news that Johnston had been arrested in California on a charge of [[marijuana]] possession.<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book\n| first= John\n| last= Tobler\n| year= 1992\n| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= 257\n| id= CN 5585}}</ref> More seriously however, following years of a [[Social effects of rock and roll#Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll|road touring lifestyle]] and health issues surrounding stomach ulcers which stood as a challenge since high school,<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Amy|title=Q&A with Doobie Brothers' Tom Johnston|url=http://www.citybeat.com/cincinnati/blog-3753-qa_with_doobie_brothers_tom_johnston.html|work=Staff Blogs|publisher=City Beat|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}</ref> Johnston became severely ill on the eve of a major tour beginning in Memphis, Tennessee in 1975 to promote ''[[Stampede (The Doobie Brothers album)|Stampede]]''. Johnston's condition was so precarious that he required emergency hospitalization for a bleeding ulcer. With Johnston convalescing and the tour already underway, fellow Doobie Brother Jeff Baxter proposed recruiting a fellow Steely Dan alum to fill the hole.<ref name=\"The Doobie Brothers\">[[The Doobie Brothers]]</ref> This led to the emergency hiring of [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]], who became the lead singer of the band. Restored to fitness in 1976 and briefly back in the band, Johnston contributed one original song to ''Takin' It to the Streets'' (\"Turn It Loose\"), and also added a vocal [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] to Pat Simmons' tune \"Wheels of Fortune\". He also made live appearances with the band in 1976 (appearing in a concert filmed that year at the Winterland in San Francisco, excerpts from which appear occasionally on [[VH1 Classic]]), but was sidelined once again in the fall due to exhaustion. None of Johnston's songs appeared on ''Livin' on the Fault Line'', though he had written and the band had recorded five of his compositions for the album. Finally, before ''Fault Line'' was released, Johnston had his songs removed and left the band that he co-founded (though he received credit for guitars and vocals and was pictured on the album's inner sleeve band photo).<ref name=\"The Doobie Brothers\"/> After a few years of restored health but growing differences in musical direction between band members, Johnston finally left the band in 1977 to pursue a solo career that produced two albums with Warner Bros: ''Everything You've Heard Is True'' and ''Still Feels Good'' (reissued on compact disc by [[Wounded Bird Records]]), and Billboard Hot 100 hit \"Savannah Nights\" (#34 Top 100 Billboard Hit \u22121980).<ref name=\"Shasho\"/>\n\nJohnston toured in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the Tom Johnston Band, which featured fellow Doobie John Hartman on drums. While working on his solo projects, in 1982 Johnston rejoined the band for a [[farewell tour]] concert, after which The Doobie Brothers ceased performing as a band for the next five years.\n\nIn 1985, Johnston toured US clubs with a group called Border Patrol, that also included former Doobies [[Michael Hossack]] and briefly Patrick Simmons. This group toured but never recorded. In 1987, he contributed a tune to the ''[[Dirty Dancing (soundtrack)|Dirty Dancing]]'' soundtrack entitled \"Where Are You Tonight?\"\n\n===Current years 1987\u2013present===\n[[File:Tom johnston and guitar mates.JPG|thumb|left|Doobie Brothers (Pat Simmons and John McFee, incl.) performing together]]\n\nJohnston joined the Doobie Brothers when they reunited for a brief tour in 1987 to benefit The National Veterans Foundation.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} This event led to the permanent reformation of the band, with Johnston again performing alongside co-founder Simmons. Johnston co-wrote, sang and contributed a signature guitar solo to the group's last major chart hit, \"The Doctor\" (from 1989's ''[[Cycles (The Doobie Brothers album)|Cycles]]'').{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} This was followed by the album ''Brotherhood'' in 1991 which featured four songs by Johnston, and ''Sibling Rivalry'' in 2000 featuring the single \"People Gotta Love Again\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Doobies' most recent album, 2010's ''World Gone Crazy'', features 13 songs, eight of which were written by Johnston including the album's title track and the first single \"Nobody\", a rerecording of the band's first single in 1971.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Road and studio gear outfitting==\n\"Mine [first guitar] was an arch-back Harmony acoustic with f-holes.

He started with a [[Gibson J-45#Gibson J-50|Gibson J-50]] which was used to record all acoustic guitar parts on the first four Doobie Brother albums and after it was stolen moved to Martin guitars. In his personal collection are a 1962 Martin 00\u201318 and a 1975 Martin D-42, and he has written various songs on the 00-18.<ref name=\"News\">{{cite web|title=Martin Introduces Doobie-42 Tom Johnston Model Guitar [ Winter NAMM 2007 ]|url=http://weimprovise.net/news/1736|work=Winter NAMM Blogs|publisher=We Improvise|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}</ref> Johnston uses a variety of software in his home studio for writing, and Digital Performer by MOTU as his recording software program.<ref name=\"Shasho\"/>\n\nJohnston has employed traditionally a three finger Clapton-Hendrix lead fingerstyle, only using all four fingers for barre chords. He said, \"I use my little finger to play chords, but not for playing solos. The direction in which I bend a string depends on where the string I'm bending is on the neck. The lower strings are going to be pulled down, and the high strings are going to be pushed up. I use a lot of vibrato when I play solo. And for picking, it has to be up and down if you want to do a lot of speed. It's also better for clarity. Anything faster than quarter notes, you either have to use alternating picking or play with a regular flatpick and fingers.\"<ref name=\"Menn\"/>\n\nJohnston has traditionally employed Herco Nylon Flex 50 flatpicks (old \"Herco mediums\"),<ref>https://www.jimdunlop.com/product/he210p-7-10137-01950-8</ref>{{failed verification|date=January 2019}} allowing for the right combination of flex and durability for his chukka-style rhythm. He said \"I always use Herco medium because they don't break, and they take forever to wear out. Actually the worst thing you can do with a Herco is lose it. They are easy to hold on to as well and I do sweat a lot playing live. In fact, I usually eat the nickel off the strings right down to the brass (circa 1976).\"<ref name=\"Menn\"/>\n\nIn 2007<ref name=\"News\"/> C.F.
