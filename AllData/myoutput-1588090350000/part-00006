They constitute one of the few surviving examples of [[industrial architecture]] from the transitional period between [[Art Nouveau]] and 20th century styles. The two halls are open steel structures, the northern hall is a longitudinal edifice boasting three naves and a 3,800 m<sup>2</sup> footprint; the southern hall (1,800 m<sup>2</sup>) is a building with a [[lantern roof]]. Rupprecht Matthies created two \"language cylinders\" visitors can walk through for Deichtorplatz, which is also home to a [[Richard Serra]] sculpture. In the northern hall, there is a line of neon writing by [[Mario Merz]] and a \"Blue Disc\" by [[Imi Knoebel]].\n\nThe K\u00f6rber Foundation gifted the restored Deichtorhallen to the City of Hamburg. In 1989, they were assigned to a [[limited liability company]]: Deichtorhallen-Ausstellungs GmbH.
