The group was established through a merger of the rival [[International Working Union of Socialist Parties|Vienna International]] and the former [[Second International]], based in London, and was the forerunner of the present-day [[Socialist International]].\n\nThe LSI had a history of rivalry with the [[Communist International]] (Comintern), with which it competed over the leadership of the international socialist and labour movement. However, unlike the Comintern, the LSI maintained no direct control over the actions of its sections, being constituted as a [[federation]] of autonomous national parties.\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\n[[File:1910 Arthur Henderson.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Arthur Henderson]] (1863\u20131935) of the British Labour Party was chosen as the first chairman of the Executive Committee of the LSI in 1923.]]\n\nDespite the hostility expressed by the [[Communist International]], the left wing of the [[social democracy|social democratic movement]] sought an international \"union of the whole proletariat\" through 1922.<ref name=Braunthal2-264>Julius Braunthal, ''History of the International: Volume 2: 1914-1943.'' [1963] John Clark, trans. New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1967; pg. 264.</ref> This initiative finally came to a close at the end of the year with the convocation of the [[4th World Congress of the Comintern]], which decisively rejected calls for a broad and inclusive international body.<ref name=Braunthal2-264/> \n\nThis rejection by the Communist wing of the international socialist movement left the center and right \u2014 in the form of the [[International Working Union of Socialist Parties|Vienna International]] and the [[Second International|London International]], respectively \u2014 to patch together their own joint international body.<ref name=Braunthal2-264/> Planning for such a body began in January 1923, a month after the conclusion of the Comintern's 4th World Congress, with the Executive Committees of the Vienna and London groups issuing a joint statement condemning the Communists' decision.<ref name=Braunthal2-264/> The two Executive Committees subsequently issued a convention call for a unification congress in May.<ref name=Braunthal2-264/>\n\nOn May 21, 1923, some 620 delegates representing 41 socialist political parties in 30 countries was convened in [[Hamburg]], Germany to bring about the unification of the two Internationals.<ref name=Braunthal2-264 /> A wide array of political tendencies were represented among these delegates, running the ideological gamut from activists in the left wing of the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) and the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD) to moderate reformists of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]].<ref name=Braunthal2-265>Braunthal, ''History of the International,'' vol. 2, pg. 265.</ref> \n\nThe gathering was dominated by 80 delegates of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), including among its membership such esteemed leaders of the international socialist movement as [[Karl Kautsky]], [[Eduard Bernstein]], and [[Rudolf Hilferding]].<ref name=Braunthal2-265 /> Other prominent figures in attendance included [[Arthur Henderson]] and [[Sidney Webb]] of the British Labour Party; [[Friedrich Adler (politician)|Friedrich Adler]] and [[Otto Bauer]], and [[Karl Renner]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SP\u00d6); [[Emile Vandervelde]] and [[Camille Huysmans]] of the [[Belgian Labour Party]] (BWP); and the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Russian [[Mensheviks]] [[Pavel Axelrod]], [[Raphael Abramovitch]], and [[Fyodor Dan]], among others.<ref name=Braunthal2-265/>\n\nThe unity congress voted to establish itself as a new International under the name \"Labour and Socialist International\" (LSI).<ref name=Braunthal2-265 /> In marked difference from the Communist movement, no preconditions were established for admission, nor was any binding policy program adopted.<ref name=Braunthal2-265/> Instead the Hamburg Congress issued a manifesto stating that the new International \"must grow naturally from the process through which Socialist parties get adapted to one another.\"<ref name=Braunthal2-265 /> Total agreement on fundamental principles was not expected \"at the moment of its birth,\" but the desire was voiced that establishment of the new international body would over time serve as \"one of the most important conditions for the harmonizing of their views.\"<ref name=Braunthal2-265/>\n\n===Structure===\nThe LSI was to remain a federation of fully independent and autonomous political parties \u2014 groups which were freely allowed under organizational statutes to determine their own internal policies and programs.<ref name=Braunthal2-266>Braunthal, ''History of the International,'' vol. 2, pg. 266.</ref> The organization was modeled upon the old [[Second International]], with supreme authority vested in the international congress, which could be convened at any time upon the demand of 10 or more affiliated parties, so long as these represented at least a quarter of the organization's voting strength.<ref name=Braunthal2-267>Braunthal, ''History of the International,'' vol. 2, pg. 267.</ref> \n\nGovernance between congresses was to be conducted by an Executive Committee, with its participants elected by the member parties.<ref name=Braunthal2-267 /> The Executive Committee was given the power to elect its own chair and other officers, to determine the location for its central office, and to elect a 9-member Bureau for prior consideration of matters of concern in advance of meetings of the full Executive Committee.<ref name=Braunthal2-267 /> The Executive Committee was additionally to establish a 6-member special committee of local members residing at or near the seat of the committee, who were to be responsible for supervising the work of the Executive and its officers and arranging meetings of the Bureau and the Executive Committee.<ref name=Braunthal2-267/>\n\nThe first Executive Committee, elected by the 1923 Hamburg Congress, included [[Arthur Henderson]] of the British Labour Party as chairman, [[Harry Gosling]] of the British Labour Party as treasurer, with the Austrian Friedrich Adler and the Englishman [[Tom Shaw (politician)|Tom Shaw]] joining as members of the group's Secretariat.<ref name=Braunthal2-267/> London was chosen as the seat of the Executive Committee.<ref name=Braunthal2-267/>\n\n===Development===\nThe LSI functioned as a continuation of the [[Second International]].<ref>Jackie Smith, Charles Chatfield, and Ron Pagnucco, ''Transnational Social Movements and Global Politics: Solidarity Beyond the State.'' Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1997; gp. 35.</ref> \n\nThe [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] was the dominant party within the LSI.<ref>James Jupp, ''The Radical Left in Britain, 1931\u20131941.'' London: Frank Cass, 1982; pg. 13.</ref>\n\n===Response to Nazism===\nWith the rise of Nazism in Europe, there was increased pressure on the LSI and Comintern to cooperate. On February 19, 1933, the LSI Bureau issued a call for joint action of the SPD and the [[Communist Party of Germany]] against [[Adolf Hitler]]'s regime. The Comintern responded by stating that they were not convinced of the sincerity of the declaration. However, the Comintern did soon call its national sections to form [[united front]]s together with social democratic parties locally. The LSI, on its side, did not accept the notion of local social democrats forming united fronts with the communist parties.<ref>Jupp, ''The Radical Left in Britain,'' pg. 45.</ref> However, as the Comintern adopted a more conciliatory tone, the resistance of the LSI against forming such united fronts on the national level softened.<ref>Jupp, ''The Radical Left in Britain,'' pg. 68.</ref>\n\nWithin the LSI, a north-south cleavage emerged, as the Mediterranean LSI parties built fronts with the communists whilst the British and Scandinavian parties rejected the notion of cooperation with the communists. With the German party in disarray, the British and Scandinavians became more influential within the LSI. Thus the space for socialist-communist cooperation decreased. On September 25, 1934, the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International|Comintern Executive]] issued a call for 'peace negotiations' between the two internationals, but the LSI rejected the offer.<ref>Jupp, ''The Radical Left in Britain,'' pg. 77.</ref>\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], the LSI and the [[International Federation of Trade Unions]] launched an 'Aid for Spain' campaign.<ref>Rhiannon Vickers, ''The Labour Party and the World.'' Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2004; pg. 125.</ref> The LSI/IFTU relief efforts were channelled through the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) and [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]] (UGT).<ref>Tom Buchanan, ''The Spanish Civil War and the British Labour Movement.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1991; pg. 144.</ref>\n\n===Colonial question===\nAlthough the communists opposed colonialism, the LSI were generally supportive of colonialism. For example, the participation of the British [[Independent Labour Party]] in the communist-sponsored [[League against Imperialism]] caused a controversy within LSI, and the ILP was asked to break its ties with the League. However, the support of the LSI for colonialism was not complete. Regarding the [[Rif War]], the second LSI congress, held in [[Marseille]] August 22\u201327, 1925, adopted a resolution calling for support of the independence of the [[Rif]] and urging the [[League of Nations]] to accept the [[Rif Republic]] as a member.<ref>Jonathan Derrick, ''Africa's \"Agitators\": Militant Anti-Colonialism in Africa and the West, 1918\u20131939.''

The group was established through a merger of the rival [[International Working Union of Socialist Parties|Vienna International]] and the former [[Second International]], based in London, and was the forerunner of the present-day [[Socialist International]].\n\nThe LSI had a history of rivalry with the [[Communist International]] (Comintern), with which it competed over the leadership of the international socialist and labour movement. However, unlike the Comintern, the LSI maintained no direct control over the actions its sections, being constituted as a [[federation]] of autonomous national parties.\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\n[[File:1910 Arthur Henderson.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Arthur Henderson]] (1863\u20131935) of the British Labour Party was chosen as the first chairman of the Executive Committee of the LSI in 1923.]]\n\nDespite the hostility expressed by the [[Communist International]], the left wing of the [[social democracy|social democratic movement]] sought an international \"union of the whole proletariat\" through 1922.<ref name=Braunthal2-264>Julius Braunthal, ''History of the International: Volume 2: 1914-1943.''

[[Friedrich Adler (politician)|Friedrich Adler]] and [[Otto Bauer]], and [[Karl Renner]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SP\u00d6); [[Emile Vandervelde]] and [[Camille Huysmans]] of the [[Belgian Labour Party]] (BWP); and the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Russian [[Mensheviks]] [[Pavel Axelrod]], [[Raphael Abramovitch]], and [[Fyodor Dan]], among others.<ref name=Braunthal2-265/>\n\nThe unity congress voted to establish itself as a new International under the name \"Labour and Socialist International\" (LSI).<ref name=Braunthal2-265 /> In marked difference from the Communist movement, no preconditions were established for admission, nor was any binding policy program adopted.<ref name=Braunthal2-265/> Instead the Hamburg Congress issued a manifesto stating that the new International \"must grow naturally from the process through which Socialist parties get adapted to one another.\"<ref name=Braunthal2-265 /> Total agreement on fundamental principles was not expected \"at the moment of its birth,\" but the desire was voiced that establishment of the new international body would over time serve as \"one of the most important conditions for the harmonizing of their views.\"<ref name=Braunthal2-265/>\n\n===Structure===\nThe LSI was to remain a federation of fully independent and autonomous political parties \u2014 groups which were freely allowed under organizational statutes to determine their own internal policies and programs.<ref name=Braunthal2-266>Braunthal, ''History of the International,'' vol. 2, pg. 266.</ref> The organization was modeled upon the old [[Second International]], with supreme authority vested in the international congress, which could be convened at any time upon the demand of 10 or more affiliated parties, so long as these represented at least a quarter of the organization's voting strength.<ref name=Braunthal2-267>Braunthal, ''History of the International,'' vol. 2, pg. 267.</ref> \n\nGovernance between congresses was to be conducted by an Executive Committee, with its participants elected by the member parties.<ref name=Braunthal2-267 /> The Executive Committee was given the power to elect its own chair and other officers, to determine the location for its central office, and to elect a 9-member Bureau for prior consideration of matters of concern in advance of meetings of the full Executive Committee.<ref name=Braunthal2-267 /> The Executive Committee was additionally to establish a 6-member special committee of local members residing at or near the seat of the committee, who were to be responsible for supervising the work of the Executive and its officers and arranging meetings of the Bureau and the Executive Committee.<ref name=Braunthal2-267/>\n\nThe first Executive Committee, elected by the 1923 Hamburg Congress, included [[Arthur Henderson]] of the British Labour Party as chairman, [[Harry Gosling]] of the British Labour Party as treasurer, with the Austrian Friedrich Adler and the Englishman [[Tom Shaw (politician)|Tom Shaw]] joining as members of the group's Secretariat.<ref name=Braunthal2-267/> London was chosen as the seat of the Executive Committee.<ref name=Braunthal2-267/>\n\n===Development===\nThe LSI functioned as a continuation of the [[Second International]].<ref>Jackie Smith, Charles Chatfield, and Ron Pagnucco, ''Transnational Social Movements and Global Politics: Solidarity Beyond the State.'' Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1997; gp. 35.</ref> \n\nThe [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] was the dominant party within the LSI.<ref>James Jupp, ''The Radical Left in Britain, 1931\u20131941.'' London: Frank Cass, 1982; pg. 13.</ref>\n\n===Response to Nazism===\nWith the rise of Nazism in Europe, there was increased pressure on the LSI and Comintern to cooperate. On February 19, 1933, the LSI Bureau issued a call for joint action of the SPD and the [[Communist Party of Germany]] against [[Adolf Hitler]]'s regime. The Comintern responded by stating that they were not convinced of the sincerity of the declaration. However, the Comintern did soon call its national sections to form [[united front]]s together with social democratic parties locally. The LSI, on its side, did not accept the notion of local social democrats forming united fronts with the communist parties.<ref>Jupp, ''The Radical Left in Britain,'' pg. 45.</ref> However, as the Comintern adopted a more conciliatory tone, the resistance of the LSI against forming such united fronts on the national level softened.<ref>Jupp, ''The Radical Left in Britain,'' pg. 68.</ref>\n\nWithin the LSI, a north-south cleavage emerged, as the Mediterranean LSI parties built fronts with the communists whilst the British and Scandinavian parties rejected the notion of cooperation with the communists. With the German party in disarray, the British and Scandinavians became more influential within the LSI. Thus the space for socialist-communist cooperation decreased. On September 25, 1934, the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International|Comintern Executive]] issued a call for 'peace negotiations' between the two internationals, but the LSI rejected the offer.<ref>Jupp, ''The Radical Left in Britain,'' pg. 77.</ref>\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], the LSI and the [[International Federation of Trade Unions]] launched an 'Aid for Spain' campaign.<ref>Rhiannon Vickers, ''The Labour Party and the World.'' Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2004; pg. 125.</ref> The LSI/IFTU relief efforts were channelled through the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) and [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]] (UGT).<ref>Tom Buchanan, ''The Spanish Civil War and the British Labour Movement.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1991; pg. 144.</ref>\n\n===Colonial question===\nAlthough the communists opposed colonialism, the LSI were generally supportive of colonialism. For example, the participation of the British [[Independent Labour Party]] in the communist-sponsored [[League against Imperialism]] caused a controversy within LSI, and the ILP was asked to break its ties with the League.
