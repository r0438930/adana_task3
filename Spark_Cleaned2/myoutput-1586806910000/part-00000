Despite Judy being the academy valedictorian, Chief Bogo doubts her potential and delegates her to parking duty. On her first day, she is hustled by a con artist fox duo, Nick Wilde and Finnick.\n\nJudy abandons parking duty to arrest Duke Weaselton, a weasel who stole a bag of [[crocus]] bulbs known as ''Midnicampum Holicithias''. As she is reprimanded by Bogo, an otter named Mrs. Otterton enters Bogo's office pleading for someone to find her husband Emmitt, one of fourteen predators who have gone missing. Bogo is forced to let a volunteering Judy take the case when Assistant Mayor Dawn Bellwether praises the assignment and informs Mayor Leodore Lionheart. He gives Judy 48 hours to find Emmitt on the condition that she must resign if she fails.\n\nDeducing that Nick was the last to see Emmitt, Judy blackmails him into assisting her by covertly recording his confession of [[tax evasion]]. They track Otterton to a limousine owned by crime boss Mr. Big, who reveals Otterton went \"savage\"\u2014reverted to a [[Feral animal|feral state]]\u2014and attacked his chauffeur Manchas. At his home, Manchas mentions Otterton yelled about \"Night Howlers\" before the attack. Manchas himself then turns savage and chases the pair. Judy saves Nick by trapping Manchas and calls the ZPD for help, but Manchas disappears before they arrive. Bogo demands Judy's resignation, but Nick defends Judy, reminding Bogo that she has 10 more hours to solve the case. After leaving on a [[gondola lift]], Nick tells his story about his childhood dream to join the junior ranger scouts, in which he has been tormented by them on his first day, due to being a fox.\n\nJudy and Nick then travel to the City Hall to access to the city's traffic cameras. They discover Manchas was captured by wolves, who Judy surmises are the \"Night Howlers\". They locate the missing predators\u2014who have all turned savage\u2014imprisoned at Cliffside Asylum, where Lionheart is secretly quarantining them while attempting to determine the cause of their behavior. Judy records a video of Lionheart discussing the plot with her cell phone and reports him to the ZPD; Lionheart and the asylum staff are arrested for false imprisonment, and Bellwether becomes the new mayor.\n\nJudy, praised for solving the case, asks Nick to join the ZPD as her partner. At her following press conference, however, Judy suggests that the cause of the savage behavior is predator biology, as predators are the only ones going savage; in anger, Nick rejects Judy's offer and abandons her. Hateful speech and discrimination against predators runs rampant throughout Zootopia. Wracked with guilt for the consequences of her words, Judy resigns from the ZPD and returns to Bunnyburrow.\n\nBack home, Judy learns from her parents and Gideon Grey, a fox that bullied her as a child, but is now a pie salesman to her family's business, that the Night Howlers are actually the crocus bulbs Weaselton stole, and they contain a [[neurotoxin]] that has severe [[Psychoactive drug|psychotropic effects]] on mammals. After returning to Zootopia and tearfully reconciling with Nick, the pair confront Weaselton, who is pressured by Mr. Big and reveals that the bulbs he stole were meant for a [[Sheep|ram]] named Doug. They find Doug in a laboratory hidden in the city subway developing a drug made from Night Howlers, which he has been shooting at predators with a [[Tranquillizer gun|dart gun]].\n\nJudy and Nick obtain the serum as evidence, but before they can reach the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them in the Natural History Museum, revealing herself as the mastermind behind a prey-[[Supremacism|supremacist]] conspiracy to frame predators as dangerous and savage. Bellwether retrieves the evidence after Nick refuses to abandon an injured Judy. She shoots Nick with a serum pellet to make him attack Judy and fakes a call to the ZPD, but the pellets she is using are revealed to have been replaced with blueberries by Nick. Judy then baits Bellwether into openly declaring her role in the attacks(as well as framing Lionheart) and records the confession just as Bogo and his deputies arrive at the scene.\n\nBellwether is arrested for her treachery, while Lionheart publicly denies knowledge of her plot and defends his committal of the savage predators as a necessary precaution to maintain public safety, quoting that he did 'the wrong thing for the right reason'. The savage animals are cured and Judy rejoins the ZPD. Nick graduates from the Zootopia Police Academy as the city's first fox police officer and becomes Judy's partner.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=}}\n*[[Ginnifer Goodwin]] as Judy Hopps, an optimistic rabbit from Bunnyburrow who is a newly appointed member of the Zootopia Police Department assigned to the 1st Precinct.<ref name=THRGoodwinJoins>{{cite news|last1=Kit |first1=Borys |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ginnifer-goodwin-joins-jason-bateman-793927 |title=Ginnifer Goodwin Joins Jason Bateman in Disney Animation's 'Zootopia' (Exclusive) |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=May 6, 2015 |accessdate=May 6, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002407/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ginnifer-goodwin-joins-jason-bateman-793927 |archivedate=May 9, 2015 }}</ref>\n**Della Saba voices a younger Judy Hopps.\n*[[Jason Bateman]] as Nick Wilde, a sly [[red fox]] who is a small-time con artist.<ref name=THRGoodwinJoins /><ref name=THRBateman />\n**[[Kath Soucie]] voices a younger Nick Wilde.\n*[[Idris Elba]] as Chief Bogo, an [[African buffalo]] who is the [[Chief of police|police chief]] of the Zootopia Police Department's 1st Precinct.<ref name=DeadlineCast>{{cite web|last1=Pedersen |first1=Erik |title=Disney's 'Zootopia' Cages Idris Elba, J.K.

Therefore, the studio's IT engineers developed the fur-controlling software \"iGroom\", which gave character designers precise control over the brushing, shaping and shading of fur and made it possible to create a variety of eccentric character styles for each animal. The software was also able to control an unseen \"imaginary\" under-layer that gave fur a degree of plushness not seen before. This feature was used to create characters like Officer Clawhauser, who has a big head that is entirely made of spotted fur. Characters with noteworthy numbers of strands of hair or fur included both of the two lead characters, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, who each had around 2.5 million hairs; a giraffe with nine million strands of fur; a gerbil with 480,000 strands; and a rodent with more strands of hair than the 400,000 that were on [[Elsa (Disney)|Elsa]]'s head in ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.<ref name=\"Engadget\"/>\n\n''Zootopia'' was the second time Disney used the Hyperion renderer, which they had first used on ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]''. A new fur paradigm was added to the renderer to facilitate the creation of realistic images of the animals' dense fur. Nitro, a real-time display application developed since the making of ''Wreck-It Ralph'', was used to make the fur more consistent, intact and subtle much more quickly, as opposed to the previous practice of having to predict how the fur would work while making and looking at silhouettes or poses for the character. The tree-and-plant generator Bonsai, first used in ''Frozen'', was used to make numerous variations of trees with very detailed foliage.<ref name = \"Engadget\"/>\n\n''Zootopia'' was produced in makeshift quarters in a giant warehouse in [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood]] (together with ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'') while Disney Animation's headquarters in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] was being renovated.<ref name=\"Snetiker\">{{cite news|last1=Snetiker |first1=Marc |title=Moana directors Ron Clements, John Musker talk four decades Disney movies |url=http://ew.com/article/2016/11/24/moana-disney-ron-clements-john-musker/ |accessdate=January 13, 2017 |work=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Time Inc. |date=November 24, 2016 |location=New York |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118114500/http://ew.com/article/2016/11/24/moana-disney-ron-clements-john-musker/ |archivedate=January 18, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nOn May 6, 2015, Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin were announced as having been cast, respectively in the roles of Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps.<ref name=THRGoodwinJoins/> The filmmakers chose Bateman because they wanted an actor who could bring \"a funny yet heartfelt side\" with \"a wily, dry-witted sort of voice\". Bateman described his character as \"a crafty, sarcastic schemer\", remarking on the role's similarity to many other roles he had done since he was 12.

The lawsuit claims that Goldman (in 2000 and 2009) pitched a concept to Disney for a live-action film titled ''Looney'', which was about a socially awkward animator who creates a self-inspired TV cartoon called ''Zootopia''. Disney twice rejected the pitch, but Goldman accused the company of copying the name, themes, settings, and character tropes. Filed with the lawsuit was a graphic of early concept artwork of characters that are claimed to appear similar to major characters from the film, including Nick Wilde, Judy Hopps, Flash, and Chief Bogo.

Despite Judy being the academy valedictorian, Chief Bogo doubts her potential and delegates her to parking duty. On her first day, she is hustled by a con artist fox duo, Nick Wilde and Finnick.\n\nJudy abandons parking duty to arrest Duke Weaselton, a weasel who stole a bag of [[crocus]] bulbs known as ''Midnicampum Holicithias''. As she is reprimanded by Bogo, an otter named Mrs. Otterton enters Bogo's office pleading for someone to find her husband Emmitt, one of fourteen predators who have gone missing. Bogo is forced to let a volunteering Judy take the case when Assistant Mayor Dawn Bellwether praises the assignment and informs Mayor Leodore Lionheart. He gives Judy 48 hours to find Emmitt on the condition that she must resign if she fails.\n\nDeducing that Nick was the last to see Emmitt, Judy blackmails him into assisting her by covertly recording his confession of [[tax evasion]]. They track Otterton to a limousine owned by crime boss Mr. Big, who reveals Otterton went \"savage\"\u2014reverted to a [[Feral animal|feral state]]\u2014and attacked his chauffeur Manchas. At his home, Manchas mentions Otterton yelled about \"Night Howlers\" before the attack. Manchas himself then turns savage and chases the pair. Judy saves Nick by trapping Manchas and calls the ZPD for help, but Manchas disappears before they arrive. Bogo demands Judy's resignation, but Nick defends Judy, reminding Bogo that she has 10 more hours to solve the case. After leaving on a [[gondola lift]], Nick tells his story about his childhood dream to join the junior ranger scouts, in which he has been tormented by them on his first day, due to being a fox.\n\nJudy and Nick then travel to the City Hall to access to the city's traffic cameras. They discover Manchas was captured by wolves, who Judy surmises are the \"Night Howlers\". They locate the missing predators\u2014who have all turned savage\u2014imprisoned at Cliffside Asylum, where Lionheart is secretly quarantining them while attempting to determine the cause of their behavior. Judy records a video of Lionheart discussing the plot with her cell phone and reports him to the ZPD; Lionheart and the asylum staff are arrested for false imprisonment, and Bellwether becomes the new mayor.\n\nJudy, praised for solving the case, asks Nick to join the ZPD as her partner. At her following press conference, however, Judy suggests that the cause of the savage behavior is predator biology, as predators are the only ones going savage; in anger, Nick rejects Judy's offer and abandons her. Hateful speech and discrimination against predators runs rampant throughout Zootopia. Wracked with guilt for the consequences of her words, Judy resigns from the ZPD and returns to Bunnyburrow.\n\nBack home, Judy learns from her parents and Gideon Grey, a fox that bullied her as a child, but is now a pie salesman to her family's business, that the Night Howlers are actually the crocus bulbs Weaselton stole, and they contain a [[neurotoxin]] that has severe [[Psychoactive drug|psychotropic effects]] on mammals. After returning to Zootopia and tearfully reconciling with Nick, the pair confront Weaselton, who is pressured by Mr. Big and reveals that the bulbs he stole were meant for a [[Sheep|ram]] named Doug. They find Doug in a laboratory hidden in the city subway developing a drug made from Night Howlers, which he has been shooting at predators with a [[Tranquillizer gun|dart gun]].\n\nJudy and Nick obtain the serum as evidence, but before they can reach the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them in the Natural History Museum, revealing herself as the mastermind behind a prey-[[Supremacism|supremacist]] conspiracy to frame predators as dangerous and savage. Bellwether retrieves the evidence after Nick refuses to abandon an injured Judy. She shoots Nick with a serum pellet to make him attack Judy and fakes a call to the ZPD, but the pellets she is using are revealed to have been replaced with blueberries by Nick. Judy then baits Bellwether into openly declaring her role in the attacks(as well as framing Lionheart) and records the confession just as Bogo and his deputies arrive at the scene.\n\nBellwether is arrested for her treachery, while Lionheart publicly denies knowledge of her plot and defends his committal of the savage predators as a necessary precaution to maintain public safety, quoting that he did 'the wrong thing for the right reason'. The savage animals are cured and Judy rejoins the ZPD. Nick graduates from the Zootopia Police Academy as the city's first fox police officer and becomes Judy's partner.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=}}\n*[[Ginnifer Goodwin]] as Judy Hopps, an optimistic rabbit from Bunnyburrow who is a newly appointed member of the Zootopia Police Department assigned to the 1st Precinct.<ref name=THRGoodwinJoins>{{cite news|last1=Kit |first1=Borys |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ginnifer-goodwin-joins-jason-bateman-793927 |title=Ginnifer Goodwin Joins Jason Bateman in Disney Animation's 'Zootopia' (Exclusive) |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=May 6, 2015 |accessdate=May 6, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002407/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ginnifer-goodwin-joins-jason-bateman-793927 |archivedate=May 9, 2015 }}</ref>\n**Della Saba voices a younger Judy Hopps.\n*[[Jason Bateman]] as Nick Wilde, a sly [[red fox]] who is a small-time con artist.<ref name=THRGoodwinJoins /><ref name=THRBateman />\n**[[Kath Soucie]] voices a younger Nick Wilde.\n*[[Idris Elba]] as Chief Bogo, an [[African buffalo]] who is the [[Chief of police|police chief]] of the Zootopia Police Department's 1st Precinct.<ref name=DeadlineCast>{{cite web|last1=Pedersen |first1=Erik |title=Disney's 'Zootopia' Cages Idris Elba, J.K.

Therefore, the studio's IT engineers developed the fur-controlling software \"iGroom\", which gave character designers precise control over the brushing, shaping and shading of fur and made it possible to create a variety of eccentric character styles for each animal. The software was also able to control an unseen \"imaginary\" under-layer that gave fur a degree of plushness not seen before. This feature was used to create characters like Officer Clawhauser, who has a big head that is entirely made of spotted fur. Characters with noteworthy numbers of strands of hair or fur included both of the two lead characters, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, who each had around 2.5 million hairs; a giraffe with nine million strands of fur; a gerbil with 480,000 strands; and a rodent with more strands of hair than the 400,000 that were on [[Elsa (Disney)|Elsa]]'s head in ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.<ref name=\"Engadget\"/>\n\n''Zootopia'' was the second time Disney used the Hyperion renderer, which they had first used on ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]''. A new fur paradigm was added to the renderer to facilitate the creation of realistic images of the animals' dense fur. Nitro, a real-time display application developed since the making of ''Wreck-It Ralph'', was used to make the fur more consistent, intact and subtle much more quickly, as opposed to the previous practice of having to predict how the fur would work while making and looking at silhouettes or poses for the character. The tree-and-plant generator Bonsai, first used in ''Frozen'', was used to make numerous variations of trees with very detailed foliage.<ref name = \"Engadget\"/>\n\n''Zootopia'' was produced in makeshift quarters in a giant warehouse in [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood]] (together with ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'') while Disney Animation's headquarters in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] was being renovated.<ref name=\"Snetiker\">{{cite news|last1=Snetiker |first1=Marc |title=Moana directors Ron Clements, John Musker talk four decades Disney movies |url=http://ew.com/article/2016/11/24/moana-disney-ron-clements-john-musker/ |accessdate=January 13, 2017 |work=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Time Inc. |date=November 24, 2016 |location=New York |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118114500/http://ew.com/article/2016/11/24/moana-disney-ron-clements-john-musker/ |archivedate=January 18, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nOn May 6, 2015, Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin were announced as having been cast, respectively in the roles of Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps.<ref name=THRGoodwinJoins/> The filmmakers chose Bateman because they wanted an actor who could bring \"a funny yet heartfelt side\" with \"a wily, dry-witted sort of voice\".

The lawsuit claims that Goldman (in 2000 and 2009) pitched a concept to Disney for a live-action film titled ''Looney'', which was about a socially awkward animator who creates a self-inspired TV cartoon called ''Zootopia''. Disney twice rejected the pitch, but Goldman accused the company of copying the name, themes, settings, and character tropes. Filed with the lawsuit was a graphic of early concept artwork of characters that are claimed to appear similar to major characters from the film, including Nick Wilde, Judy Hopps, Flash, and Chief Bogo. A Disney spokesperson described the lawsuit as being \"ridden with patently false allegations\".<ref name=\"goldmanlawsuit\">{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/03/zootopia-lawsuit-disney-copyright-infringement-gary-goldman-1202047892/ |title=Disney Slams \"False\" 'Zootopia' Big $$$ Copyright Suit From 'Total Recall' Scribe |first=Dominic |last=Patten |date=March 21, 2017 |accessdate=March 21, 2017 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321234106/http://deadline.com/2017/03/zootopia-lawsuit-disney-copyright-infringement-gary-goldman-1202047892/ |archivedate=March 21, 2017 }}</ref> After months of back-and-forth deliberation between the two parties, US.
