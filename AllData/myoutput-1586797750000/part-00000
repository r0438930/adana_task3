Opened on October 1, 1971, the resort is owned and operated by [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products]], a division of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. It was first operated by [[Walt Disney World Company]]. The property covers nearly {{convert|25000|acre|sqmi km2|0}}, of which only half has been used.<ref name=\"Fun Facts\">{{Cite  news|url=http://wdwnews.com/fact-sheets/2014/10/31/walt-disney-world-fun-facts/|title=Walt Disney World Fun Facts|work=Walt Disney World News |language=en-us |access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> The resort comprises four [[Amusement park|theme parks]] (consisting of [[Magic Kingdom]], [[Epcot]], [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]], and [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]]), two [[water park]]s, 27 themed [[resort|resort hotels]], nine non-Disney hotels, several golf courses, a camping resort, and other entertainment venues, including the outdoor shopping center [[Disney Springs]].\n\nDesigned to supplement [[Disneyland]], in [[Anaheim, California]], which had opened in 1955, the complex was developed by [[Walt Disney]] in the 1960s. \"The Florida Project\", as it was known, was intended to present a distinct vision with its own diverse set of attractions. Walt Disney's original plans also called for the inclusion of an \"[[EPCOT (concept)|Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow]]\" (EPCOT), a [[planned community]] intended to serve as a test bed for new city-living innovations. Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, during the initial planning of the complex.  After his death, the company wrestled with the idea of whether to bring the Disneyworld project to fruition. Walt's older brother, Roy, came out of retirement to make sure Walt's biggest dream was realized, (construction started in 1967) but without Walt spearheading the construction, the company built a resort similar to Disneyland, abandoning the experimental concepts for a planned community. [[Magic Kingdom]] was the first theme park to open in the complex, in 1971, followed by [[Epcot]] (1982), [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] (1989), and [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] (1998).  It was Roy who insisted the name of the entire complex be changed from Disneyworld, to Walt Disney World, ensuring that people would remember that the project was Walt's dream.\n\nIn 2018, Walt Disney World was the most visited vacation resort in the world, with an average annual attendance of more than 58 million.<ref name=\"2018 Report\"/> The resort is the flagship destination of Disney's worldwide corporate enterprise and has become a [[Popular culture|popular staple]] in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].\n\nOn March 15, 2020, Walt Disney World closed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].

Market surveys at the time revealed that only 5% of Disneyland's visitors came from east of the [[Mississippi River]], where 75% of the population of the United States lived. Additionally, [[Walt Disney]] disliked the businesses that had sprung up around Disneyland and wanted more control over a larger area of land in the next project.<ref name=\"married\">{{cite book|title=Married to the Mouse|last=Fogleson|first=Richard E.|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0-300-09828-0|page=274}}</ref>\n\nWalt Disney flew over a potential site in [[Orlando, Florida]]\u2014one of many\u2014in November 1963. After witnessing the well-developed network of roads and taking the planned construction of both [[Interstate 4]] and [[Florida's Turnpike]] into account, with [[McCoy Air Force Base]] (later [[Orlando International Airport]]) to the east, Disney selected a centrally located site near [[Bay Lake (Florida)|Bay Lake]].<ref name=\"Quest\">{{cite book|title=Walt Disney and the Quest for Community|last=Mannheim|first=Steve|year=2002|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing|Ashgate Publishing Limited]]|location=Aldershot, Hampshire, England|isbn=978-0-7546-1974-1|pages=68\u201370|ref=Mann02}}</ref> To avoid a burst of land speculation, [[Walt Disney World Company]] used various [[dummy corporation]]s to acquire {{convert|30500|acre|sqmi km2|0}} of land.<ref name=\"Quest\"/> In May 1965, some of these major land transactions were recorded a few miles southwest of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] in [[Osceola County, Florida|Osceola County]]. In addition, two large tracts totaling $1.5 million were sold, and smaller tracts of flatlands and cattle pastures were purchased by exotically named companies such as the \"[[Interstate 4|Ayefour]] Corporation\", \"Latin-American Development and Management Corporation\" and the \"Reedy Creek Ranch Corporation\". Some are now memorialized on a window above Main Street, U.S.A. in [[Magic Kingdom]]. The smaller parcels of land acquired were called \"outs\". They were {{convert|5|acre|4=0|adj=on|spell=in}} lots [[plat]]ted in 1912 by the Munger Land Company and sold to investors. Most of the owners in the 1960s were happy to get rid of the land, which was mostly [[swamp]] at the time. Another issue was the [[mineral rights]] to the land, which were owned by [[Tufts University]]. Without the transfer of these rights, Tufts could come in at any time and demand the removal of buildings to obtain minerals. Eventually, Disney's team negotiated a deal with Tufts to buy the mineral rights for $15,000.<ref>{{cite book|title=Realityland: True-Life Adventures at Walt Disney World|last=Koenig|first=David|year=2007|publisher=Bonaventure Press|location=Irvine, CA|isbn=978-0-9640605-2-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/realityland00/page/25 25\u201326]|ref=Koenig07|url=https://archive.org/details/realityland00/page/25}}</ref>\n\nWorking strictly in secrecy, real estate agents unaware of their client's identity began making offers to landowners in April 1964 in parts of southwest Orange and northwest Osceola counties.

However, the publication denied its accuracy based on an earlier interview with Disney at Kennedy Space Center, in which he claimed a $50 million investment was in the works for Disneyland, and that he had no interest in building a new park.<ref name=\"WDW-Secret\"/> In October 1965, editor [[Emily Bavar]] from the ''Sentinel'' visited Disneyland during the park's 10th-anniversary celebration. In an interview with Disney, she asked him if he was behind recent land purchases in Central Florida. Bavar later described that Disney \"looked like I had thrown a bucket of water in his face\" before denying the story.<ref name=\"WDW-Secret\"/> His reaction, combined with other research obtained during her Anaheim visit, led Bavar to author a story on October 21, 1965, where she predicted that Disney was building a second theme park in Florida.<ref name=\"WDW-Secret\"/> Three days later after gathering more information from various sources, the ''Sentinel'' published another article headlined, \"We Say: 'Mystery Industry' Is Disney\".<ref name=\"WDW-Secret\"/>\n\nWalt Disney had originally planned to publicly reveal Disney World on November 15, 1965, but in light of the ''Sentinel'' story, Disney asked Florida Governor [[Haydon Burns]] to confirm the story on October 25.

His brother and business partner, [[Roy O. Disney]], postponed his retirement to oversee construction of the resort's first phase.\n\nOn February 2, 1967, Roy O. Disney held a press conference at the Park Theatres in [[Winter Park, Florida]]. The role of EPCOT was emphasized in the film that was played. After the film, it was explained that for Disney World, including EPCOT, to succeed, a special district would have to be formed: the [[Reedy Creek Improvement District]] with two cities inside it, [[Bay Lake, Florida|Bay Lake]] and Reedy Creek, now [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida|Lake Buena Vista]]. In addition to the standard powers of an incorporated city, which include the issuance of tax-free bonds, the district would have immunity from any current or future county or state land-use laws. The only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be [[property tax]]es and [[elevator]] inspections.<ref name=\"married\"/> The legislation forming the district and the two cities was signed into law by Florida Governor [[Claude R. Kirk, Jr.]] on May 12, 1967.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Bob|title=Walt Disney - An American Original|date=1994|url=http://kpolsson.com/wdworld/ |page=357 |accessdate=September 21, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024034807/http://kpolsson.com/wdworld/|archivedate=October 24, 2015}}</ref> The [[Supreme Court of Florida]] then ruled in 1968 that the district was allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds for public projects within the district, despite the sole beneficiary being Walt Disney Productions.\n\nThe district soon began construction of drainage canals, and Disney built the first roads and the Magic Kingdom. The [[Disney's Contemporary Resort|Contemporary Resort Hotel]] and [[Disney's Polynesian Resort|Polynesian Village]] were also completed in time for the park's opening on October 1, 1971.<ref name=\"dwfonfr\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0-4eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wCQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6996%2C2342976 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |agency=UPI |title=Disney World Florida opens next Friday |date=September 27, 1971 |page=11}}</ref><ref name=\"opfgteslns\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SsEzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=izIHAAAAIBAJ&pg=7198%2C139625 |newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel |location=California |agency=UPI |title=Walt Disney World opens Florida gates |date=October 2, 1971 |page=10 }}</ref> The Palm and Magnolia golf courses near Magic Kingdom had opened a few weeks before, while [[Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground|Fort Wilderness]] opened one month later. Twenty-four days after the park opened, Roy O. Disney dedicated the property and declared that it would be known as \"Walt Disney World\" in his brother's honor. In his own words: \"Everyone has heard of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] cars. But have they all heard of [[Henry Ford]], who started it all? Walt Disney World is in memory of the man who started it all, so people will know his name as long as Walt Disney World is here.\" After the dedication, Roy Disney asked Walt's widow, [[Lillian Disney|Lillian]], what she thought of Walt Disney World.

The concept evolved into the resort's second theme park, [[Epcot|EPCOT Center]], which opened in 1982 (renamed [[Epcot|EPCOT]] in 1996). While still emulating Walt Disney's original idea of showcasing new technology, the park is closer to a [[world's fair]] than a \"community of tomorrow\". One of EPCOT's main attractions is their world's showcase which highlights 11 countries across the globe. Some of the urban planning concepts from the original idea of EPCOT would instead be integrated into the community of [[Celebration, Florida|Celebration]] much later. The resort's third theme park, [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]] (renamed Disney's Hollywood Studios in 2008), opened in 1989 and is inspired by show business. The resort's fourth theme park, [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], opened in 1998.\n\n[[George Kalogridis]] was named president of the resort in December 2012, replacing [[Meg Crofton]], who had overseen the site since 2006.\n\nOn January 21, 2016, the resort's management structure was changed, with general managers within a theme park being in charge of an area or land, instead of on a functional basis as previously. Theme parks have already had a vice-president overseeing them. [[Disney Springs]] and Disney Sports were also affected.

[[Public transport|mass transportation system]] allowing guest access across the property. The fare-free system utilizes buses, monorails, gondola lifts, watercraft, and parking lot trams.\n\nThe [[Walt Disney World Monorail System]] provides free transportation at Walt Disney World; guests can board the monorail and travel between the Magic Kingdom and Epcot, including select on-property resorts such as [[Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa|The Grand Floridian]] and [[Disney's Polynesian Village Resort|The Polynesian Village]]. The system operates on three routes that interconnect at the [[Transportation and Ticket Center]] (TTC), adjacent to the Magic Kingdom's parking lot. Disney Transport owns a fleet of Disney-operated [[bus]]es on property, that is also complimentary for guests.\n\nA [[gondola lift]] system, dubbed [[Disney Skyliner]], opened in 2019. The system's three lines connect Disney's Hollywood Studios and Epcot with four resort hotels.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-disney-gondola-cost-20180124-story.html|title=Disney's gondola system picks up $3.8 million worth of electrical work|last=Russon|first=Gabrielle|work=Orlando Sentinel |language=en-US |access-date=June 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDisney Transport also operates a fleet of watercraft, ranging in size from [[water taxi]]s, up to the [[Ferry|ferries]] that connect the Magic Kingdom to the Transportation and Ticket Center. Disney Transport is also responsible for maintaining the fleet of [[Trackless train|parking lot trams]] that are used for shuttling visitors between the various theme park parking lots and their respective main entrances.\n\nIn addition to its free transportation methods, in conjunction with [[Lyft]], Walt Disney World also offers an [[Transportation network company|on-demand transportation service]] for a fee. The Minnie Van Service are [[Chevy Traverse]]s dressed in a [[Minnie Mouse]] red-and-white polka dot design that can accommodate up to six people and have two carseats available to anyone that is within the Walt Disney World Resort limits.

Since [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], uniformed security has been stationed outside each Disney park in Florida to search guests' bags as they enter the parks. Starting April 3, 2017, bag checkpoints have been placed at Magic Kingdom's resort monorail entryways and the Transportation and Ticket Center's ferry entry points prior to embarkation as well as the walkway from Disney's Contemporary Resort. Guests arriving the Transportation and Ticket Center by tram or tour bus will be screened at the former tram boarding areas. Guests arriving by Disney Resort hotel bus or [[Disney Transport#Minnie Van|Minnie Van\u2122]] have their own bag check just outside the bus stops. Guests arriving via Magic Kingdom Resort boat launch will be bag checked on the arrival dock outside Magic Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wdwmagic.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/news/03apr2017-photos---new-bag-check-areas-greatly-enhance-magic-kingdom-arrival-experience.htm |title=New bag check areas greatly enhance Magic Kingdom arrival experience |publisher=Walt Disney World |accessdate=July 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe land where Walt Disney World resides is part of the [[Reedy Creek Improvement District]] (RCID), a governing jurisdiction created in 1967 by the State of Florida at the request of Disney. RCID provides 911 services, fire, environmental protection, building code enforcement, utilities and road maintenance but does not provide law enforcement services. The approximately 800 security staff are instead considered employees of the Walt Disney Company. Arrests and citations are issued by the [[Florida Highway Patrol]] along with the [[Orange County Sheriff's Office (Florida)|Orange County]] and Osceola County sheriffs deputies who patrol the roads. Disney security does maintain a fleet of security vans equipped with flares, traffic cones, and chalk commonly used by police officers. These security personnel are charged with traffic control by the RCID and may only issue personnel violation notices to Disney and RCID employees, not the general public.<ref name=\"married 2\">{{cite book|last=Foglesong|first=Richard E. |title=Married to the Mouse|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2003|pages=69,139|isbn=978-0-300-09828-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Florida Supreme Court|others=Alabama.

Disney and the Reedy Creek Improvement District were sued for access to Disney Security records by Bob and Kathy Sipkema following the death of their son at the resort in 1994. The court characterized Disney security as a \"night watchman\" service not a law enforcement agency and was not subject to Florida's open records laws. An appeals court later upheld the lower court's ruling.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pastor\n|first=James F. |title=Security Law and Methods|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |year=2006|pages=505\u2013512|isbn=978-0-7506-7994-7}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2015, Disney confirmed the addition of randomized secondary screenings and dogs trained to detect body-worn explosives within parks, in addition to metal detectors at entrances.

It is common for a corporation to rent entire parks for the evening. In such cases, special passes are issued which are valid for admission to all rides and attractions.

Opened on October 1, 1971, the resort is owned and operated by [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products]], a division of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. It was first operated by [[Walt Disney World Company]]. The property covers nearly {{convert|25000|acre|sqmi km2|0}}, of which only half has been used.<ref name=\"Fun Facts\">{{Cite  news|url=http://wdwnews.com/fact-sheets/2014/10/31/walt-disney-world-fun-facts/|title=Walt Disney World Fun Facts|work=Walt Disney World News |language=en-us |access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> The resort comprises four [[Amusement park|theme parks]] (consisting of [[Magic Kingdom]], [[Epcot]], [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]], and [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]]), two [[water park]]s, 27 themed [[resort|resort hotels]], nine non-Disney hotels, several golf courses, a camping resort, and other entertainment venues, including the outdoor shopping center [[Disney Springs]].\n\nDesigned to supplement [[Disneyland]], in [[Anaheim, California]], which had opened in 1955, the complex was developed by [[Walt Disney]] in the 1960s. \"The Florida Project\", as it was known, was intended to present a distinct vision with its own diverse set of attractions. Walt Disney's original plans also called for the inclusion of an \"[[EPCOT (concept)|Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow]]\" (EPCOT), a [[planned community]] intended to serve as a test bed for new city-living innovations. Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, during the initial planning of the complex.  After his death, the company wrestled with the idea of whether to bring the Disneyworld project to fruition. Walt's older brother, Roy, came out of retirement to make sure Walt's biggest dream was realized, (construction started in 1967) but without Walt spearheading the construction, the company built a resort similar to Disneyland, abandoning the experimental concepts for a planned community. [[Magic Kingdom]] was the first theme park to open in the complex, in 1971, followed by [[Epcot]] (1982), [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] (1989), and [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] (1998).  It was Roy who insisted the name of the entire complex be changed from Disneyworld, to Walt Disney World, ensuring that people would remember that the project was Walt's dream.\n\nIn 2018, Walt Disney World was the most visited vacation resort in the world, with an average annual attendance of more than 58 million.<ref name=\"2018 Report\"/> The resort is the flagship destination of Disney's worldwide corporate enterprise and has become a [[Popular culture|popular staple]] in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].\n\nOn March 15, 2020, Walt Disney World closed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].

Market surveys at the time revealed that only 5% of Disneyland's visitors came from east of the [[Mississippi River]], where 75% of the population of the United States lived. Additionally, [[Walt Disney]] disliked the businesses that had sprung up around Disneyland and wanted more control over a larger area of land in the next project.<ref name=\"married\">{{cite book|title=Married to the Mouse|last=Fogleson|first=Richard E.|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0-300-09828-0|page=274}}</ref>\n\nWalt Disney flew over a potential site in [[Orlando, Florida]]\u2014one of many\u2014in November 1963. After witnessing the well-developed network of roads and taking the planned construction of both [[Interstate 4]] and [[Florida's Turnpike]] into account, with [[McCoy Air Force Base]] (later [[Orlando International Airport]]) to the east, Disney selected a centrally located site near [[Bay Lake (Florida)|Bay Lake]].<ref name=\"Quest\">{{cite book|title=Walt Disney and the Quest for Community|last=Mannheim|first=Steve|year=2002|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing|Ashgate Publishing Limited]]|location=Aldershot, Hampshire, England|isbn=978-0-7546-1974-1|pages=68\u201370|ref=Mann02}}</ref> To avoid a burst of land speculation, [[Walt Disney World Company]] used various [[dummy corporation]]s to acquire {{convert|30500|acre|sqmi km2|0}} of land.<ref name=\"Quest\"/> In May 1965, some of these major land transactions were recorded a few miles southwest of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] in [[Osceola County, Florida|Osceola County]]. In addition, two large tracts totaling $1.5 million were sold, and smaller tracts of flatlands and cattle pastures were purchased by exotically named companies such as the \"[[Interstate 4|Ayefour]] Corporation\", \"Latin-American Development and Management Corporation\" and the \"Reedy Creek Ranch Corporation\". Some are now memorialized on a window above Main Street, U.S.A. in [[Magic Kingdom]]. The smaller parcels of land acquired were called \"outs\". They were {{convert|5|acre|4=0|adj=on|spell=in}} lots [[plat]]ted in 1912 by the Munger Land Company and sold to investors. Most of the owners in the 1960s were happy to get rid of the land, which was mostly [[swamp]] at the time. Another issue was the [[mineral rights]] to the land, which were owned by [[Tufts University]]. Without the transfer of these rights, Tufts could come in at any time and demand the removal of buildings to obtain minerals. Eventually, Disney's team negotiated a deal with Tufts to buy the mineral rights for $15,000.<ref>{{cite book|title=Realityland: True-Life Adventures at Walt Disney World|last=Koenig|first=David|year=2007|publisher=Bonaventure Press|location=Irvine, CA|isbn=978-0-9640605-2-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/realityland00/page/25 25\u201326]|ref=Koenig07|url=https://archive.org/details/realityland00/page/25}}</ref>\n\nWorking strictly in secrecy, real estate agents unaware of their client's identity began making offers to landowners in April 1964 in parts of southwest Orange and northwest Osceola counties.

However, the publication denied its accuracy based on an earlier interview with Disney at Kennedy Space Center, in which he claimed a $50 million investment was in the works for Disneyland, and that he had no interest in building a new park.<ref name=\"WDW-Secret\"/> In October 1965, editor [[Emily Bavar]] from the ''Sentinel'' visited Disneyland during the park's 10th-anniversary celebration.

Bavar later described that Disney \"looked like I had thrown a bucket of water in his face\" before denying the story.<ref name=\"WDW-Secret\"/> His reaction, combined with other research obtained during her Anaheim visit, led Bavar to author a story on October 21, 1965, where she predicted that Disney was building a second theme park in Florida.<ref name=\"WDW-Secret\"/> Three days later after gathering more information from various sources, the ''Sentinel'' published another article headlined, \"We Say: 'Mystery Industry' Is Disney\".<ref name=\"WDW-Secret\"/>\n\nWalt Disney had originally planned to publicly reveal Disney World on November 15, 1965, but in light of the ''Sentinel'' story, Disney asked Florida Governor [[Haydon Burns]] to confirm the story on October 25.

His brother and business partner, [[Roy O. Disney]], postponed his retirement to oversee construction of the resort's first phase.\n\nOn February 2, 1967, Roy O. Disney held a press conference at the Park Theatres in [[Winter Park, Florida]]. The role of EPCOT was emphasized in the film that was played. After the film, it was explained that for Disney World, including EPCOT, to succeed, a special district would have to be formed: the [[Reedy Creek Improvement District]] with two cities inside it, [[Bay Lake, Florida|Bay Lake]] and Reedy Creek, now [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida|Lake Buena Vista]]. In addition to the standard powers of an incorporated city, which include the issuance of tax-free bonds, the district would have immunity from any current or future county or state land-use laws. The only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be [[property tax]]es and [[elevator]] inspections.<ref name=\"married\"/> The legislation forming the district and the two cities was signed into law by Florida Governor [[Claude R.

The [[Disney's Contemporary Resort|Contemporary Resort Hotel]] and [[Disney's Polynesian Resort|Polynesian Village]] were also completed in time for the park's opening on October 1, 1971.<ref name=\"dwfonfr\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0-4eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wCQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6996%2C2342976 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |agency=UPI |title=Disney World Florida opens next Friday |date=September 27, 1971 |page=11}}</ref><ref name=\"opfgteslns\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SsEzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=izIHAAAAIBAJ&pg=7198%2C139625 |newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel |location=California |agency=UPI |title=Walt Disney World opens Florida gates |date=October 2, 1971 |page=10 }}</ref> The Palm and Magnolia golf courses near Magic Kingdom had opened a few weeks before, while [[Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground|Fort Wilderness]] opened one month later. Twenty-four days after the park opened, Roy O. Disney dedicated the property and declared that it would be known as \"Walt Disney World\" in his brother's honor. In his own words: \"Everyone has heard of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] cars. But have they all heard of [[Henry Ford]], who started it all? Walt Disney World is in memory of the man who started it all, so people will know his name as long as Walt Disney World is here.\" After the dedication, Roy Disney asked Walt's widow, [[Lillian Disney|Lillian]], what she thought of Walt Disney World.

The concept evolved into the resort's second theme park, [[Epcot|EPCOT Center]], which opened in 1982 (renamed [[Epcot|EPCOT]] in 1996). While still emulating Walt Disney's original idea of showcasing new technology, the park is closer to a [[world's fair]] than a \"community of tomorrow\". One of EPCOT's main attractions is their world's showcase which highlights 11 countries across the globe. Some of the urban planning concepts from the original idea of EPCOT would instead be integrated into the community of [[Celebration, Florida|Celebration]] much later. The resort's third theme park, [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]] (renamed Disney's Hollywood Studios in 2008), opened in 1989 and is inspired by show business. The resort's fourth theme park, [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], opened in 1998.\n\n[[George Kalogridis]] was named president of the resort in December 2012, replacing [[Meg Crofton]], who had overseen the site since 2006.\n\nOn January 21, 2016, the resort's management structure was changed, with general managers within a theme park being in charge of an area or land, instead of on a functional basis as previously. Theme parks have already had a vice-president overseeing them. [[Disney Springs]] and Disney Sports were also affected.

[[Public transport|mass transportation system]] allowing guest access across the property. The fare-free system utilizes buses, monorails, gondola lifts, watercraft, and parking lot trams.\n\nThe [[Walt Disney World Monorail System]] provides free transportation at Walt Disney World; guests can board the monorail and travel between the Magic Kingdom and Epcot, including select on-property resorts such as [[Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa|The Grand Floridian]] and [[Disney's Polynesian Village Resort|The Polynesian Village]]. The system operates on three routes that interconnect at the [[Transportation and Ticket Center]] (TTC), adjacent to the Magic Kingdom's parking lot. Disney Transport owns a fleet of Disney-operated [[bus]]es on property, that is also complimentary for guests.\n\nA [[gondola lift]] system, dubbed [[Disney Skyliner]], opened in 2019. The system's three lines connect Disney's Hollywood Studios and Epcot with four resort hotels.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-disney-gondola-cost-20180124-story.html|title=Disney's gondola system picks up $3.8 million worth of electrical work|last=Russon|first=Gabrielle|work=Orlando Sentinel |language=en-US |access-date=June 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDisney Transport also operates a fleet of watercraft, ranging in size from [[water taxi]]s, up to the [[Ferry|ferries]] that connect the Magic Kingdom to the Transportation and Ticket Center. Disney Transport is also responsible for maintaining the fleet of [[Trackless train|parking lot trams]] that are used for shuttling visitors between the various theme park parking lots and their respective main entrances.\n\nIn addition to its free transportation methods, in conjunction with [[Lyft]], Walt Disney World also offers an [[Transportation network company|on-demand transportation service]] for a fee.

Since [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], uniformed security has been stationed outside each Disney park in Florida to search guests' bags as they enter the parks. Starting April 3, 2017, bag checkpoints have been placed at Magic Kingdom's resort monorail entryways and the Transportation and Ticket Center's ferry entry points prior to embarkation as well as the walkway from Disney's Contemporary Resort. Guests arriving the Transportation and Ticket Center by tram or tour bus will be screened at the former tram boarding areas. Guests arriving by Disney Resort hotel bus or [[Disney Transport#Minnie Van|Minnie Van\u2122]] have their own bag check just outside the bus stops.

RCID provides 911 services, fire, environmental protection, building code enforcement, utilities and road maintenance but does not provide law enforcement services. The approximately 800 security staff are instead considered employees of the Walt Disney Company. Arrests and citations are issued by the [[Florida Highway Patrol]] along with the [[Orange County Sheriff's Office (Florida)|Orange County]] and Osceola County sheriffs deputies who patrol the roads. Disney security does maintain a fleet of security vans equipped with flares, traffic cones, and chalk commonly used by police officers. These security personnel are charged with traffic control by the RCID and may only issue personnel violation notices to Disney and RCID employees, not the general public.<ref name=\"married 2\">{{cite book|last=Foglesong|first=Richard E. |title=Married to the Mouse|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2003|pages=69,139|isbn=978-0-300-09828-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Florida Supreme Court|others=Alabama.

Disney and the Reedy Creek Improvement District were sued for access to Disney Security records by Bob and Kathy Sipkema following the death of their son at the resort in 1994. The court characterized Disney security as a \"night watchman\" service not a law enforcement agency and was not subject to Florida's open records laws.

Then, cast members announce that the parks are closing, sometime before the private event starts, and clear the parks of guests who do not have the special passes.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Disney theme park attractions]]\n*[[List of Disney attractions that were never built]]\n* [[Walt Disney World Company]]\n* [[Walt Disney Travel Company]]\n* [[Walt Disney World Hospitality and Recreation Corporation]]\n* [[Disney College Program]]\n* [[Incidents at Walt Disney World]]\n* [[Rail transport in Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]]\n* [[Walt Disney World Casting Center]]\n* ''[[The Walt Disney World Explorer]]''\n* [[Walt Disney World International Program]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}}\n\n{{Subject bar |book=Walt Disney World Resort| commons= Category:Walt Disney World Resort|d=Q206859|d-search=Q206859 |voy=Walt Disney World|n=Walt Disney World|portal1=Disney |portal3=Florida |portal4=Trains |portal5=Transport |portal6=Animals}}\n{{Walt Disney World}}\n{{WDW Resorts}}\n{{Disney Parks, Experiences and Products}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1971 establishments in Florida]]\n[[Category:Amusement parks in Greater Orlando]]\n[[Category:Amusement parks opened in 1971]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Lake Buena Vista, Florida]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Osceola County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Resorts in Florida]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Orange County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Osceola County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney World| ]]\n", "name_user": "Invisiblechameleon", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World"}
