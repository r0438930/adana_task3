[[Moscow Belorussky railway station|Belorussky railway station]] faces the square. The streets which terminate at the square are, in counterclockwise order, [[Leningradsky Avenue]], Gruzinsky Val, 2nd Brestskaya Street, 1st Brestskaya Street, 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street, Lesnaya Street, and Butyrsky Val.\n\n== History ==\nThe site of the square is the former edge of the city of Moscow on the road to [[Tver]]. A customs post (''zastava'') was established there in 1742. Victorious Russian armies passed through the gate there, and in 1814 a wooden [[triumphal arch]] was erected at what was now called Triumphalnaya (Triumphal) Square, to celebrate victory over [[Napoleon]].<ref name=Square>[http://moscow.ru/en/entertainment/square/index.php?id_4=16380 History of Tverskaya Zastava Square] at Moscow International Portal, [https://web.archive.org/web/20190306043154/http://moscow.ru/en/entertainment/square/index.php?id_4=16380 archived] on 2019-03-06.</ref> In 1834 this was replaced by a [[Triumphal Arch of Moscow|masonry arch]]<ref>[http://moscow.ru/en/entertainment/monuments/index.php?id_4=16365 Triumphal Arch] at Moscow International Portal, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150509130140/http://moscow.ru/en/entertainment/monuments/index.php?id_4=16365 archived] on 2015-05-09.</ref> and the square was renamed New Triumphal Gates Square. \n\nWhat is now Belorussky railway station opened at the square in 1870 under the name of Smolensky station.

That year the square was redesigned and the arch removed; it is now at [[Victory Square, Moscow|Victory Square]].<ref name=Square/>\n\nBy 1950 Tverskaya Zastava Square had been laid out as a park.
