This results in an abnormal word order, e.g. ''ad- cruth ca\u00edn -cichither'' \"[the] fair form will be seen\" (where ''ad-chichither'' is the future third-person singular passive of ''ad-c\u00ed'' \"sees\").<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Paul |authorlink= |title=An Introduction to the Celtic Languages |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |location=London |pages=288 |url=}}</ref>\n\n===Old Norse===\nExamples of tmesis have been found in [[Skald|skaldic poetry]].

German sentence structure normally places verbs in second position or final position. For separable prefix verbs, the prefix always appears in final position. If a particular sentence's structure places the entire verb in final position then the prefix and root verb appear together. If a sentence places the verb in second position then only the root verb will appear in second position; the separated prefix remains at the end of the sentence. For example, the separable verb ''anfangen'' (\"to start\") consists of the separable prefix ''an'' and the root ''fangen'':\n\n:Root verb in second position: ''Ich '''fange''' die Arbeit '''an'''.'' (\"I start the work.\")\n:Root verb in final position: ''Morgens trinke ich hei\u00dfe Schokolade, weil ich dann die Arbeit '''anfange'''.'' (\"In the morning I drink hot chocolate, because afterwards I begin the work.\")\n\nHowever, in many other German verbs the prefix (such as ''be-'' or ''ent-'') is inseparable, always staying with the root verb.\n\n===English===\nColloquial examples include the common \"un-[bloody]-believable\"<!--this formatting looks incorrect--> and variants of it; multiple English words are joined with the vulgar [[interfix]] -fucking-, such as \"[[Wiktionary:unfuckingbelievable|unfuckingbelievable]]\". The phrase ''A whole nother...(story / kettle of fish / ball game)'' is an example of tmesis in English. The word ''another'' is being split by the qualifier ''whole''. The insertion is probably caused by the fact that the word consists of an indefinite article plus the word ''other'', and it is still easily analysable as such. But the word is still so much a unit that some speakers will find it incomplete to say ''a whole other''. And so, the word is reanalysed as ''a nother'' to keep the ''n'', which allows for the use of a qualifier while retaining all the letters of the word.\n\nIn that sense, words such as ''apron'' and ''uncle'' may be seen as the result of tmesis of ''napron'' and ''nuncle''.\n\nEnglish employs a large number of [[phrasal verb]]s, consisting of a core verb and a particle which could be an adverb or a preposition; while the phrasal verb is written as two words, the two words are analyzed semantically as a unit because the meaning of the phrasal verb is often unrelated (or only loosely related) to the meaning of the core verb. For example, ''turn off'' has a meaning unrelated to ''turn'' in ''Turn off the television set and the light''.\n\nMany English phrasal verbs are separable, in the sense that if they are transitive then the object is placed between the core verb and the particle if the object is a pronoun (and optionally if it is a short noun phrase, but not if it is a long noun phrase as in the example above). For example:\n\n:''Turn off the light''  OR  ''Turn the light off'' (optional tmesis)\n:''Turn it off'' (mandatory tmesis)\n\nThis intervention of the object in the middle of the phrasal verb can be viewed as a form of tmesis even though the semantic unit being separated is written as two words even when not separated.{{cn|date=December 2013}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Interfix]]\n* [[Affix]]\n* [[Clitic]]\n* [[Diacope]]\n* [[Expletive infixation]]\n* [[Lexical diffusion]]\n* {{section link|Portuguese personal pronouns|Syntax}} on future verbs\n* [[Separable verb]]\n* [[Split infinitive]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Rhetoric]]\n[[Category:Figures of speech]]\n[[Category:Poetic devices]]\n[[Category:Word order]]\n[[Category:Infixes]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Splitting of a word or phrase and insertion of another word or phrase in the middle}}{{multiple issues|\n  {{refimprove|date=January 2017}}\n  {{expert|date=January 2017}}\n}}\n{{Wiktionary|tmesis}}\n'''Tmesis''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t|m|i\u02d0|s|\u026a|s|,_|t|\u0259|\u02c8|m|i\u02d0|-}};<ref>Oxford University Press, [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/tmesis \"Oxford Dictionary: 'tmesis'\"], ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Retrieved 19 August, 2014.</ref><ref>Dictionary.com, [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tmesis \"Dictionary.com: 'tmesis'\"], ''Dictionary.com'', Retrieved 19 August, 2014.</ref> [[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u03c4\u03bc\u1fc6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}} ''tm\u0113sis'', \"a cutting\" < {{lang|grc|\u03c4\u03ad\u03bc\u03bd\u03c9}} ''temn\u014d'', \"I cut\") is a linguistic phenomenon in which a word or phrase is separated into two parts, with other words between them.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Oxford University Press (1992), p. 1044 {{ISBN|0-19-214183-X}}</ref>\n\n==Verbs==\nTmesis of [[Prefix|prefixed]] verbs (whereby the prefix is separated from the simple verb) was an original feature of the [[Ancient Greek]] language, common in [[Homer]] (and later poetry), but not used in [[Attic Greek|Attic]] prose.
