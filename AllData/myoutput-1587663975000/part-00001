During the colonial period, there was an increase in the number of Chinese immigrants into the Philippines. The Spaniards restricted the activities of the Chinese and confined them to the [[Pari\u00e1n]] which was located near [[Intramuros]]. Most of the Chinese residents earned their livelihood as traders.\n\nMany of the Chinese who arrived during the Spanish period were Cantonese, who worked as labourers, but there were also Fujianese, who entered the retail trade. The Chinese resident in the islands were encouraged to intermarry with Filipinos, convert to Roman Catholicism and adopt Hispanic names, surnames and customs through the ''[[Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos]]'' introduced by the Spaniards in the mid-19th century.\n\nDuring the [[United States]] colonial period, the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of the United States was also applied to the Philippines.<ref name=\"the Chinese Exclusion Act\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thenagain.info/WebChron/USA/ChineseExclusion.html|title=Chinese Exclusion Act: 1882|work=thenagain.info}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[World War II in the Philippines|Second World War]] and the victory of the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]], many refugees who fled from Mainland China settled in the Philippines.

This [[ethno-religious]] social stratification schema was similar to the ''[[casta]]'' system used in [[Hispanic America]], with some major differences.\n\nThe system was used for taxation purposes, with ''indios'' and ''negritos'' who lived within the colony paying a base tax, ''mestizos de sangley'' paying double the base tax, ''sangleys'' paying quadruple; ''blancos'', however, paid no tax. The caste system was abolished after the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] from Spain in 1898, and the term ''Filipino'' was expanded to include the entire population of the Philippines regardless of racial ancestry. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For that purpose, the Spaniards of the country, the Chinese mestizos, and the Filipinos shall be admitted with perfect equality as cadets of the military corps; the personal-service tax shall be abolished, or an equal and general tax shall be imposed, to which all the Spaniards shall be subject. This last plan appears to me more advisable, as the poll-tax is already established, and it is not opportune to make a trial of new taxes when it is a question of allowing the country to be governed by itself. Since the annual tribute is unequal, the average shall be taken and shall be fixed, consequently, at fifteen or sixteen reals per whole tribute, or perhaps one peso fuerte annually from each adult tributary person. This regulation will produce an increase in the revenue of 200,000 or 300,000 pesos fuertes, and this sum shall be set aside to give the impulse for the amalgamation of the races, favoring crossed marriages by means of dowries granted to the single women in the following manner. To a Chinese mestizo woman who marries a Filipino shall be given 100 pesos; to a Filipino woman who marries a Chinese mestizo, Ioo pesos; to a Chinese mestizo woman who marries a Spaniard, 1,000 pesos; to a Spanish woman who marries a Chinese mestizo, 2,000 pesos; to a Filipino woman who marries a Spaniard, 2,000 pesos; to a Spanish woman who marries a Filipino chief, 3,000 or 4,000 pesos. Some mestizo and Filipino alcaldes-mayor of the provinces shall be appointed. It shall be ordered that when a Filipino chief goes to the house of a Spaniard, he shall seat himself as the latter's equal. In a word, by these and other means, the idea that they and the Castilians are two kinds of distinct races shall be erased from the minds of the natives, and the families shall become related by marriage in such manner that when free of the Castilian dominion should any exalted Filipinos try to expel or enslave our race, they would find it so interlaced with their own that their plan would be practically impossible.\"<ref name=\"Blair19152\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FrJEAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA86|title=The Philippine Islands, 1493\u20131898: Relating to China and the Chinese|author=Emma Helen Blair|publisher=A.H.

Mestizos and [[mulatto]]es born in Hispanic America living in the Philippines kept their legal classification as such, and usually came as indentured servants to the ''americanos''. The Philippine-born children of ''americanos'' were classified as ''filipinos''. Philippine-born children of mestizos and mulattoes from Hispanic America were classified based on patrilineal descent.\n\nThe [[indigenous peoples of the Philippines]] were referred to as ''Indios'' (for those of pure Austronesian descent) and [[negrito]]s. ''Indio'' was a general term applied to native Austronesians as a legal classification; it was only applied to Christianised natives who lived in proximity to the Spanish colonies. Persons who lived outside of Manila, Cebu, and areas with a large Spanish concentration were classified as such: ''naturales'' were baptised Austronesians of the lowland and coastal towns. Unbaptised Austronesians and Aetas who lived in the towns were classified as ''salvajes'' (savages) or ''infieles'' (infidels). ''Remontados'' (\"those who went to the mountains\") and ''tulisanes'' (bandits) were Austronesians and Aetas who refused to live in towns and moved upland. They were considered to live outside the social order as [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholicism]] was a driving force in everyday life as well as determinant of social class.\n\nThe Spanish legally classified the Aetas as ''negritos'', based on their appearance. The word term would be misinterpreted and used by future European scholars as an ethnoracial term in and of itself. Both Christianised Aetas who lived in the colony and unbaptised Aetas who lived in tribes outside of the colony were classified ''negrito''. Christianised Aetas who lived in Manila were not allowed to enter Intramuros and lived in areas designated for ''indios''. Persons of Aeta descent were also viewed as being outside the social order as they usually lived in tribes beyond settlements and resisted conversion to Christianity.\n\nThe fluid nature of racial integration in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period was recorded by many travelers and public figures at the time, who were favorably impressed by the lack of racial discrimination, as compared to the situation in other European colonies.\n\nAmong them was Sir [[John Bowring]], Governor General of British Hong Kong and a well-seasoned traveler who had written several books about the different cultures in Asia. He described the situation as \"admirable\" during a visit to the Philippines in the 1870s:\n<blockquote>\nThe lines separating entire classes and races, appeared to me less marked than in the Oriental colonies. I have seen on the same table, Spaniards, Mestizos (Chinos cristianos) and Indios, priests and military. There is no doubt that having one Religion forms great bonding. And more so to the eyes of one that has been observing the repulsion and differences due to race in many parts of Asia. And from one (like myself) who knows that race is the great divider of society, the admirable contrast and exception to racial discrimination so markedly presented by the people of the Philippines is indeed admirable.<ref>Chester L. Hunt (1954) ''Sociology in the Philippine setting: A modular approach'', p. 118, Phoenix Pub. House</ref>\n</blockquote>\nAnother foreign witness was English engineer, Frederic H. Sawyer, who had spent most of his life in different parts of Asia and lived in Luzon for fourteen years. His impression was that as far as racial integration and harmony was concerned, the situation in the Philippines was not equaled by any other colonial power:\n<blockquote>\n\"... Spaniards and natives lived together in great harmony, and do not know where I could find a colony in which Europeans mixes as much socially with the natives. Not in Java, where a native of position must dismount to salute the humblest Dutchman. Not in British India, where the Englishwoman has now made the gulf between British and native into a bottomless pit.\"<ref>Frederic H. Sawyer (1900) [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38081/38081-h/38081-h.htm ''The Inhabitants of the Philippines''], p. 125, New York.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Modern term and usage==\n{{Redirect|Tisoy|the 2019 tropical cyclone named by [[PAGASA]] as \"Tisoy\"|Typhoon Kammuri (2019)}}\nToday, the word ''mestizo'' is shortened as ''tisoy'' just as is the word [[Pinoy]] for Filipino.

As a result, a folk Roman Catholicism developed in the Philippines.<ref name=\"Philippine History\">{{cite web|url=http://asia.msu.edu/seasia/Philippines/History/hist_spanish.html|title=Asian Studies Center \u2013 Michigan State University \u2013 Oops!|author=International Studies & Programs at Michigan State University|work=msu.edu|access-date=2007-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009235201/http://asia.msu.edu/seasia/Philippines/History/hist_spanish.html|archive-date=2007-10-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> European settlers from Spain and Mexico immigrated and their offspring (of either [[Spanish people|Spanish]], or Spanish and Filipino) may have adopted the culture of their parents and grandparents.

During the colonial period, there was an increase in the number of Chinese immigrants into the Philippines. The Spaniards restricted the activities of the Chinese and confined them to the [[Pari\u00e1n]] which was located near [[Intramuros]]. Most of the Chinese residents earned their livelihood as traders.\n\nMany of the Chinese who arrived during the Spanish period were Cantonese, who worked as labourers, but there were also Fujianese, who entered the retail trade. The Chinese resident in the islands were encouraged to intermarry with Filipinos, convert to Roman Catholicism and adopt Hispanic names, surnames and customs through the ''[[Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos]]'' introduced by the Spaniards in the mid-19th century.\n\nDuring the [[United States]] colonial period, the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of the United States was also applied to the Philippines.<ref name=\"the Chinese Exclusion Act\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thenagain.info/WebChron/USA/ChineseExclusion.html|title=Chinese Exclusion Act: 1882|work=thenagain.info}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[World War II in the Philippines|Second World War]] and the victory of the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]], many refugees who fled from Mainland China settled in the Philippines.

This [[ethno-religious]] social stratification schema was similar to the ''[[casta]]'' system used in [[Hispanic America]], with some major differences.\n\nThe system was used for taxation purposes, with ''indios'' and ''negritos'' who lived within the colony paying a base tax, ''mestizos de sangley'' paying double the base tax, ''sangleys'' paying quadruple; ''blancos'', however, paid no tax. The caste system was abolished after the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] from Spain in 1898, and the term ''Filipino'' was expanded to include the entire population of the Philippines regardless of racial ancestry. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For that purpose, the Spaniards of the country, the Chinese mestizos, and the Filipinos shall be admitted with perfect equality as cadets of the military corps; the personal-service tax shall be abolished, or an equal and general tax shall be imposed, to which all the Spaniards shall be subject. This last plan appears to me more advisable, as the poll-tax is already established, and it is not opportune to make a trial of new taxes when it is a question of allowing the country to be governed by itself. Since the annual tribute is unequal, the average shall be taken and shall be fixed, consequently, at fifteen or sixteen reals per whole tribute, or perhaps one peso fuerte annually from each adult tributary person. This regulation will produce an increase in the revenue of 200,000 or 300,000 pesos fuertes, and this sum shall be set aside to give the impulse for the amalgamation of the races, favoring crossed marriages by means of dowries granted to the single women in the following manner. To a Chinese mestizo woman who marries a Filipino shall be given 100 pesos; to a Filipino woman who marries a Chinese mestizo, Ioo pesos; to a Chinese mestizo woman who marries a Spaniard, 1,000 pesos; to a Spanish woman who marries a Chinese mestizo, 2,000 pesos; to a Filipino woman who marries a Spaniard, 2,000 pesos; to a Spanish woman who marries a Filipino chief, 3,000 or 4,000 pesos. Some mestizo and Filipino alcaldes-mayor of the provinces shall be appointed. It shall be ordered that when a Filipino chief goes to the house of a Spaniard, he shall seat himself as the latter's equal. In a word, by these and other means, the idea that they and the Castilians are two kinds of distinct races shall be erased from the minds of the natives, and the families shall become related by marriage in such manner that when free of the Castilian dominion should any exalted Filipinos try to expel or enslave our race, they would find it so interlaced with their own that their plan would be practically impossible.\"<ref name=\"Blair19152\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FrJEAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA86|title=The Philippine Islands, 1493\u20131898: Relating to China and the Chinese|author=Emma Helen Blair|publisher=A.H.

Mestizos and [[mulatto]]es born in Hispanic America living in the Philippines kept their legal classification as such, and usually came as indentured servants to the ''americanos''. The Philippine-born children of ''americanos'' were classified as ''filipinos''. Philippine-born children of mestizos and mulattoes from Hispanic America were classified based on patrilineal descent.\n\nThe [[indigenous peoples of the Philippines]] were referred to as ''Indios'' (for those of pure Austronesian descent) and [[negrito]]s. ''Indio'' was a general term applied to native Austronesians as a legal classification; it was only applied to Christianised natives who lived in proximity to the Spanish colonies. Persons who lived outside of Manila, Cebu, and areas with a large Spanish concentration were classified as such: ''naturales'' were baptised Austronesians of the lowland and coastal towns. Unbaptised Austronesians and Aetas who lived in the towns were classified as ''salvajes'' (savages) or ''infieles'' (infidels). ''Remontados'' (\"those who went to the mountains\") and ''tulisanes'' (bandits) were Austronesians and Aetas who refused to live in towns and moved upland. They were considered to live outside the social order as [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholicism]] was a driving force in everyday life as well as determinant of social class.\n\nThe Spanish legally classified the Aetas as ''negritos'', based on their appearance. The word term would be misinterpreted and used by future European scholars as an ethnoracial term in and of itself. Both Christianised Aetas who lived in the colony and unbaptised Aetas who lived in tribes outside of the colony were classified ''negrito''. Christianised Aetas who lived in Manila were not allowed to enter Intramuros and lived in areas designated for ''indios''. Persons of Aeta descent were also viewed as being outside the social order as they usually lived in tribes beyond settlements and resisted conversion to Christianity.\n\nThe fluid nature of racial integration in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period was recorded by many travelers and public figures at the time, who were favorably impressed by the lack of racial discrimination, as compared to the situation in other European colonies.\n\nAmong them was Sir [[John Bowring]], Governor General of British Hong Kong and a well-seasoned traveler who had written several books about the different cultures in Asia. He described the situation as \"admirable\" during a visit to the Philippines in the 1870s:\n<blockquote>\nThe lines separating entire classes and races, appeared to me less marked than in the Oriental colonies. I have seen on the same table, Spaniards, Mestizos (Chinos cristianos) and Indios, priests and military. There is no doubt that having one Religion forms great bonding. And more so to the eyes of one that has been observing the repulsion and differences due to race in many parts of Asia. And from one (like myself) who knows that race is the great divider of society, the admirable contrast and exception to racial discrimination so markedly presented by the people of the Philippines is indeed admirable.<ref>Chester L. Hunt (1954) ''Sociology in the Philippine setting: A modular approach'', p. 118, Phoenix Pub. House</ref>\n</blockquote>\nAnother foreign witness was English engineer, Frederic H. Sawyer, who had spent most of his life in different parts of Asia and lived in Luzon for fourteen years. His impression was that as far as racial integration and harmony was concerned, the situation in the Philippines was not equaled by any other colonial power:\n<blockquote>\n\"... Spaniards and natives lived together in great harmony, and do not know where I could find a colony in which Europeans mixes as much socially with the natives. Not in Java, where a native of position must dismount to salute the humblest Dutchman. Not in British India, where the Englishwoman has now made the gulf between British and native into a bottomless pit.\"<ref>Frederic H. Sawyer (1900) [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38081/38081-h/38081-h.htm ''The Inhabitants of the Philippines''], p. 125, New York.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Modern term and usage==\n{{Redirect|Tisoy|the 2019 tropical cyclone named by [[PAGASA]] as \"Tisoy\"|Typhoon Kammuri (2019)}}\nToday, the word ''mestizo'' is shortened as ''tisoy'' just as is the word [[Pinoy]] for Filipino.
