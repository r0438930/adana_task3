In 1954, Chitepo became Rhodesia's second black lawyer after Prince Nguboyenja Khumalo son of King Lobengula (a special law was required to allow him to occupy chambers with white colleagues).<ref>Time Magazine, 31 March 1975</ref> On returning to Rhodesia in 1954, he practised as a lawyer and defended African nationalists such as [[Ndabaningi Sithole]] in court. In February 1960, he traveled to the US with support from the African-American Institute. [Ilanga Lasa Natal Ngomgqibelo (Saturday), February 27, 1960.]  In 1961, he served as legal adviser to [[Joshua Nkomo]], founder of the [[ZAPU|Zimbabwe African Peoples Union]] (ZAPU), at the Southern Rhodesia Constitutional Conference in London. In the same year, he was also appointed to the Board of Governors of [[Bernard Mizeki College]] along with [[Sir. W. C .R. Honey]] and [[Sir Robert Tredgold]]. The Southern Rhodesian government did not detain him, as he did not come out in the open as an official of the nationalist movement, and the regime also feared that he was too internationally well known to be locked up.\n\n==ZANU==\nIn May 1962 [[ZAPU]] was banned because of [[militarism]] and Chitepo was persuaded to go into voluntary exile to escape possible detention. He became [[Tanganyika]]'s first African Director of Public Prosecutions. The [[Ndabaningi Sithole]] and [[Joshua Nkomo]] factions of ZAPU split apart in July 1963. Nkomo's supporters founded the PCC-ZAPU (later just called ZAPU again) and favoured a more militaristic approach. As the more moderate faction, Chitepo sided with Sithole and was elected Chairman of ZANU ( having defeated [[Nathan Shamuyarira]] ) from its foundation. He held this post until 7 December 1974, when the [[Lusaka Accord]] was signed.\n\nBoth parties vied for domination but in 1964 both were banned and the leaders were all arrested. Both parties chose to leave the country and reorganise and form armies from outside Rhodesian borders, although they chose different countries to make their base. ZAPU based itself in the West and [[Zambia]] where it organised ZIPRA (the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]].) They allied with the [[Soviet Union]] and organised a vanguard of highly trained soldiers. ZANU, however, moved into [[Tanzania]] and then to [[Mozambique]] and set up ZANLA ([[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]]) which concentrated more on mobilising the masses in the countryside in a method pioneered by the Chinese.\n\nIn January 1966 Chitepo resigned as Director of Public Prosecutions and moved to [[Zambia]] to concentrate on the armed struggle. He toured world capitals canvassing support for [[ZANU]] and for the enforcement of total economic sanctions against Rhodesia. With his friendly disposition, he was very effective and earned for ZANU international recognition and respect.\n\nSithole and others prepared a comprehensive document giving powers to Chitepo to lead ZANU while Rev. Sithole was in detention and specifically authorising him to carry out the armed struggle. Accordingly, Herbert Chitepo with the military supremo [[Josiah Tongogara]] from the Karanga ethnic community, organised and planned successful military guerilla attacks and underground activities in Rhodesia from 1966 onwards. In 1972, he co-ordinated war operations with FRELIMO and opened up the north eastern region of Zimbabwe as a new and effective war front.\n\n==Assassination==\nChitepo died on 18 March 1975 in [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]] when a car bomb, placed in his Volkswagen Beetle the night before, exploded. He and Silas Shamiso, one of his bodyguards, were killed instantly. Sadat Kufamadzuba, his other bodyguard, was injured. The explosion sent part of the car onto the roof of his house and uprooted a tree next door. Hours later one of his neighbours died of injuries he sustained in the explosion.<ref name=\"details\">White, Luise. ''The Assassination of Herbert Chitepo: Texts and Politics in Zimbabwe.''

However, in his biographical account, ''The Legend of The Selous Scouts'', Lt Col [[Ronald Reid-Daly]], Officer Commanding, [[Selous Scouts|Selous Scouts Regiment]], Rhodesian Security Forces, clearly states that the Rhodesian [[Central Intelligence Organization]] (CIO) under the leadership of Director General [[Ken Flower]], masterminded the assassination of Herbert Chitepo, subsequently planting documentary evidence blaming ZANU members.\n\n\"The decision by Ken Flower...to assassinate Herbert Chitepo, head of the ZANU War Council, now showed how badly Flower has misread the ZANU/ZANLA situation.
