In a heavy engagement fought in calm weather in the close confines of [[Algeciras Bay]], the British force had been becalmed and battered, suffering heavy casualties and losing the 74-gun ship [[HMS Hannibal (1786)|HMS ''Hannibal'']]. Retiring for repairs, both sides called up reinforcements, the French receiving support first, from the Spanish fleet based at Cadiz, which sent six [[ships of the line]] to escort the French squadron to safety.\n\nArriving at Algeciras on 9 July, the combined squadron was ready to sail again on 12 July, departing Algeciras to the westwards during the evening. The British squadron under Rear-Admiral [[Sir James Saumarez]], having effected its own hasty repairs, set off in pursuit. Finding that his ships were falling behind, Saumarez instructed his captains to separate and attack the combined squadron as best they were able to. The fastest ship was [[HMS Superb (1798)|HMS ''Superb'']] under Captain [[Richard Goodwin Keats]], which sailed through the Spanish rearguard as a moonless night fell. ''Superb'' fired on the rearmost ships, setting the 112-gun [[Spanish ship Real Carlos (1787)|''Real Carlos'']] on fire and capturing the ''Saint Antoine''. Unable to determine friend from foe in the darkness, ''Real Carlos'' inadvertently engaged the Spanish ship [[Spanish ship San Hermenegildo (1789)|''San Hermenegildo'']], spreading the fire to its compatriot. Both ships subsequently exploded with enormous loss of life. A second stage of the battle then developed, as [[HMS Venerable (1784)|HMS ''Venerable'']] took the lead of the British line, attacking the rearmost French ship [[French ship Formidable (1795)|''Formidable'']] under Captain [[Amable Troude]]. In a furious and protracted engagement, ''Venerable'' suffered heavy damage and was driven ashore, allowing the remainder of the French force to return to Cadiz without further fighting.\n\nIn the aftermath of the action, ''Venerable'' was towed off the shoreline and back to Gibraltar for repairs, while the remainder of the British squadron restored the British [[blockade]] of the French and Spanish ships in Cadiz, returning the situation to that in place before the battle. This British victory, coming so soon after Saumarez's defeat in Algeciras harbour, did much to restore parity in the region and the heavy casualties inflicted on the Spanish were to contribute to a weakening of the Franco-Spanish alliance which was a contributory factor in the signing of [[Treaty of Amiens]], which brought the war to a temporary halt early the following year. In France, despite the heavy Spanish losses, the battle was celebrated as a victory, with Troude widely praised and promoted for the defence of his ship.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Algeciras campaign}}\n\n===First battle of Algeciras===\n{{main|First Battle of Algeciras}}\nIn August 1798, the French Mediterranean Fleet was largely destroyed by a British fleet at the [[Battle of the Nile]] during the [[French invasion of Egypt]]. With the [[Royal Navy]] dominant in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and their army trapped in [[Egypt]], the French sought in 1801 to augment their depleted forces in the region by sending reinforcements from the Atlantic Fleet and by purchasing ships from the [[Spanish Navy]], based in [[Cadiz]].<ref name=\"RW161\">Woodman, p. 161</ref> A [[Ganteaume's expeditions of 1801|squadron sailed]] from [[Brest, France|Brest]] on the Atlantic in January and made three failed attempts to reach Egypt, which was facing a large British invasion, before abandoning the effort and retiring to [[Toulon]] on the French Mediterranean coast. Three [[ships of the line]], [[French ship Formidable (1795)|''Formidable'']], [[French ship Indomptable (1789)|''Indomptable'']] and [[French ship Tyrannicide (1793)|''Desaix'']], had been detached from the squadron in May however and were subsequently placed under the command of Contre-Admiral [[Charles Linois]] under orders to sail for Cadiz.<ref name=\"WLC459\">Clowes, p. 459</ref> At Cadiz, the Spanish fleet had agreed to sell six ships of the line to the French Navy, and on 13 June two French [[frigates]], [[French ship Libre (1796)|''Libre'']] and [[French ship Indienne (1796)|''Indienne'']], arrived at the port to oversee the transfer under the command of Contre-Admiral [[Dumanoir le Pelley]].<ref name=\"WLC465\">Clowes, p. 465</ref>\n\n''En route'' to Cadiz, Linois had learned from the crew of the captured [[brig]] [[HMS Speedy (1782)|HMS ''Speedy'']] that a powerful British squadron of seven ships of the line under Rear-Admiral [[Sir James Saumarez]] lay off Cadiz, [[blockade|blockading]] the port. Concerned that this squadron could overwhelm his own, Linois took shelter in the small but well-defended harbour of [[Algeciras]], just across [[Algeciras Bay]] from the heavily fortified British naval base at [[Gibraltar]].<ref name=\"NM404\">Mostert, p. 404</ref> Saumarez was informed of Linois's arrival, and turned eastwards to confront him, discovering the French ships anchored in a well prepared position on the morning of 6 July. Saumarez attacked immediately, but found that his ships were hampered by a lack of wind. Becalmed under heavy fire, the British squadron inflicted severe damage on the French ships which withdrew into shallower water, two grounding. However, when Saumarez ordered his ships to follow, [[HMS Hannibal (1786)|HMS ''Hannibal'']] grounded as well, trapped under a heavy barrage from the shore.<ref name=\"WLC463\">Clowes, p. 463</ref> With no wind with which to manoeuvre and the [[ship's boat|squadron's boats]] all either sunk or engaged in towing the battered [[HMS Pomp\u00e9e (1793)|HMS ''Pomp\u00e9e'']] back to Gibraltar, Saumarez called off the attack at 13:35. The battered British squadron retired to Gibraltar, except for ''Hannibal'', which was trapped, battered and swiftly forced to surrender, having lost two masts and more than 140 men.<ref name=\"WJ118\">James, p. 118</ref>\n\n===Passage of Moreno===\nWith both squadrons badly damaged, reinforcements were called for, Linois sending a messenger overland to Cadiz with an appeal for the Spanish fleet there, under Admiral Don [[Jose de Mazarredo y Salazar|Jose de Mazzaredo]] to send a squadron to escort the French force in Algeciras to the safety of Cadiz.<ref name=\"WJ124\">James, p. 124</ref> At Cadiz, le Pelley had to plead with Mazzaredo for assistance, the Spanish admiral agreeing on 8 July to send a powerful squadron under Vice-Admiral Don {Juan Joaqu\u00edn Moreno de Mondrag\u00f3n to Algeciras. Moreno's force consisted of two 112-gun [[first rate]] ships of the line, [[Spanish ship Real Carlos (1787)|''Real Carlos'']] and [[Spanish ship San Hermenegildo (1789)|''San Hermenegildo'']], the 96-gun ''San Fernando'', 80-gun [[Spanish ship Argonauta|''Argonauta'']] and the 74-gun [[Spanish ship San Agust\u00edn (1768)|''San Agust\u00edn'']].<ref name=\"WLC466\"/> With this force was the 74-gun French ship ''Saint Antoine'', which a few days earlier had been the Spanish ''San Antonio''. ''Saint Antoine'' was the first of the French ships purchased from the Spanish Navy to enter service, the crew drawn from the crews of le Pelley's frigates supplemented by Spanish sailors and commanded by Commodore Julien le Ray. With the squadron were the frigates ''Libre'', ''Indienne'' and the Spanish ''Sabina'' as well as the French [[lugger]] ''Vautour''.<ref name=\"WJ126\">James, p. 126</ref>\n\nThe combined squadron sailed from Cadiz on 9 July, progressing rapidly southwards and reaching Algeciras Bay late in the afternoon, except for ''Saint Antoine'' which was delayed and arrived the following morning.<ref name=\"RG92\">Gardiner, p. 92</ref> The force was anchored close to Algeciras, well out of range of cannon at Gibraltar, and there waited for Linois to finish making the necessary repairs to his ships. Shadowing the combined squadron was a small British force under Captain [[Richard Goodwin Keats]] on [[HMS Superb (1798)|HMS ''Superb'']] with the frigate [[HMS Thames (1758)|HMS ''Thames'']] and the [[brig]] [[HMS Pasley|HMS ''Pasley'']]. Although part of Saumarez's squadron, Keats had been too late to take part in the first battle, and had instead cruised off Cadiz watching the Spanish fleet there. When Moreno sailed, Keats was initially chased by portions of the Franco-Spanish squadron, but eluded and followed them, subsequently joining Saumarez at Gibraltar.<ref name=\"WLC466\">Clowes, p. 466</ref> At the British port, the dockyards were the scene of frantic activity as Saumarez, supported by commissioner Captain [[Alexander Ball]], sought to repair his squadron so that it could intercept Moreno's forces on their voyage back to Cadiz. ''Pomp\u00e9e'' was temporarily abandoned in the yard, her crew redistributed to work on the rest of the squadron. Saumarez also gave orders that his flagship, [[HMS Caesar (1793)|HMS ''Caesar'']] was also to be left at Gibraltar, but Captain [[Jahleel Brenton]] requested the opportunity to repair his ship and Saumarez relented, the crew of ''Caesar'' working all day and in shifts throughout the night in order to bring their ship up to fighting standard.<ref name=\"WJ125\">James, p. 125</ref> Saumarez believed however that due to the condition of Linois's ships and the mistaken assumption that the combined squadron would sail for [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] to the east, he would have at least two weeks to prepare and sent messages to the Mediterranean Fleet under [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Lord Keith]], then at sea off Egypt, requesting support against the combined squadron.<ref name=\"JM43\">Musteen, p. 43</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n{{see also|Order of Battle in the Algeciras campaign}}\nOn 11 July the activity on Moreno's ships indicated to British observers at Gibraltar that the combined squadron was readying for sea, and the British working parties repairing Saumarez's squadron correspondingly redoubled their efforts. The arrival of a light easterly wind which would favour passage back to Cadiz encouraged both Moreno and Saumarez to prepare for departure to the Atlantic base on the following day.<ref name=\"NM406\">Mostert, p. 406</ref> At 12:00 on 12 July, ''Caesar'' [[Warping (sailing)|warped]] out of Gibraltar dockyard with her band playing the popular song \"[[Heart of Oak]]\" to the answering strains of \"[[Britons, Strike Home!]]\" from the dockside as crowds again turned out in their thousands to watch the coming battle.<ref name=\"NM407\">Mostert, p. 407</ref> By that time however, Moreno's forces were already at sea: at dawn on 12 July the leading Spanish ships loosed their sails and by 12:00 the French and Spanish squadron had begun to gather at their rendezvous point off Cabrita Point at the mouth of Algeciras Bay.<ref name=\"WJ126\"/> At 15:00, Saumarez set sail, his pennant flying from ''Caesar'' and followed by ships of the line ''Superb'', [[HMS Spencer (1800)|HMS ''Spencer'']], [[HMS Venerable (1784)|HMS ''Venerable'']] and [[HMS Audacious (1785)|HMS ''Audacious'']], frigates ''Thames'' and the Portuguese ''Carlotta'' and several smaller vessels.<ref name=\"WJ125\"/> Both Saumarez and Linois expected reinforcements sent by Lord Keith to arrive during the day, but none appeared.<ref name=\"JM44\">Musteen, p. 44</ref>\n\nAt 19:00, delayed by the effect of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] on the wind, the British squadron rounded Gibraltar and found the French and Spanish ships still assembling at Cabrita Point. The light wind prevented any rapid movement, and Saumarez began to slowly [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] towards the combined squadron in line of battle formation.<ref name=\"WJ126\"/> Moreno's departure had been delayed due to the state of the captured ''Hannibal'', renamed ''Annibal'', which was unable to make any progress under its [[jury masts]] and had been taken under tow by the frigate ''Indienne''. Sighting Saumarez's force, Moreno instructed ''Indienne'' and ''Hannibal'' to return to Algeciras and at 19:45 issued orders for the remainder of the squadron to sail west through the [[Gut of Gibraltar]] towards Cadiz.<ref name=\"WJ126\"/> He also, following Spanish naval tradition, disembarked his flagship ''Real Carlos'' and transferred to the frigate ''Sabina'', persuading Linois to quit ''Formidable'' and do the same.<ref name=\"WLC467\">Clowes, p. 467</ref>\n\n===''Superb'' and the rearguard===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \". . . the Spanish ships ''Real Carlos'', 112, and ''San Hermenegildo'', 112, mistaking each other for the aggressor, began a mutual attack, resulting in the ''Real Carlos'' losing her foretopmast, the sails of which \u2013 falling over her own guns \u2013 caught fire. While in this condition the ''Hermenegildo'' \u2013 still engaging the ''Real Carlos'' as an enemy \u2013 in the confusion fell on board her and caught fire also. Both ships burned until they blew up.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Commander [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]], Witness of the battle from Gibraltar.<ref name=\"RLA95\">Adkins, p. 95</ref>\n|}\nAt 20:00, Saumarez led his ships into the Gut after the combined squadron, but in the gathering dusk Moreno's squadron was already out of sight and the British admiral realised that his ships were too slow to catch the French and Spanish ships in their current formation before they reached the comparative safety of the open ocean.<ref name=\"NM407\"/> At 20:40, with the wind picking up, he therefore instructed the squadron to break formation and attack the rear of the combined squadron, directing his orders at Keats in ''Superb'', whose ship was the fastest.<ref name=\"RW161\">Woodman, p. 161</ref> Keats immediately set all sail and by 22:00 had regained sight of the combined squadron's rearguard, which consisted of the 112-gun ships and the ''Saint Antoine''. Behind, all Keats could see was ''Caesar'' and ''Venerable'' in the distance, and by 23:00 only ''Caesar'' was still in sight, more than {{convert|3|nmi|km}} behind ''Superb''.<ref name=\"WLC467\"/> Although he was now facing considerable odds, Keats steered ''Superb'' to within {{convert|350|yd|m}} of the ''Real Carlos'' at 23:20, coming under fire from all three vessels of the Franco-Spanish rearguard, although evading much of it by the simple tactic of not illuminating his ship so that the ships of the combined squadron fired on one another more than on their British opponent. Linois had also ordered his ships to extinguish their lights, but this only added to the confusion of the Spanish ships in the squadron.<ref name=\"JM46\"/> The moon had set and the night was quite dark, which contributed to the ineffectiveness of the Spanish gunnery.  ''Real Carlos'' fired randomly at the British ship but failed to strike it once during the brief engagement. Keats' ship was much more accurate however, firing three broadsides before ''Superb'' was carried beyond ''Real Carlos'' and towards ''Saint Antoine''. The British broadsides caused severe damage, knocking away the foretopmast and causing a fire to break out on the Spanish ship's deck following the third broadside.<ref name=\"RG92\"/> The fire grew rapidly and soon was so fierce that it could be plainly seen by observers at Gibraltar.<ref name=\"JM46\">Musteen, p. 46</ref>\n\nWith ''Real Carlos'' disabled, Keats pushed on into combat with ''Saint Antoine'', the combined French and Spanish crew engaging the British vessel as it approached.<ref name=\"LG1\"/> At 23:50, Keats laid his ship close alongside the new French ship, beginning a close and heated action as the ships of the line exchanged broadsides with one another in pitch darkness and with an increasing wind.<ref name=\"WLC467\"/> For 30 minutes the battle continued until, with the ships off [[Cape Spartel]] in North Africa, a wounded Le Ray decided that his ship was no longer able to contest the action and hailed ''Superb'' to announce that he had surrendered. The halyards that held up his pennant had however become tangled in the rigging, giving the appearance that the ship was still in French hands: this later led it to be attacked repeatedly by other British ships as they came up during the night.<ref name=\"WJ127\">James, p. 127</ref> ''Formidable'' was also to the rear of the combined squadron, escaping attack by feigning British signal lights until it had safely passed the battle between ''Superb'' and ''Saint Antoine''.<ref name=\"JM47\"/> Keats remained with his prize, awaiting the arrival of the rest of the squadron: ''Caesar'', ''Venerable'', ''Spencer'' and ''Thames'' arrived after midnight, all firing on ''Saint Antoine'' as they passed before continuing westwards in search of the remainder of Moreno's squadron. ''Superb'' was later joined by ''Carlotta'' and the small ships [[HMS Calpe (1800)|HMS ''Calpe'']] and ''Louisa'', which remained on hand during the night.<ref name=\"WJ128\">James, p. 128</ref>\n\n[[File:La Marine-Pacini-118.png|thumb|HMS ''Superb'' sails unnoticed off the Spanish fleet at Algeciras Bay, while the ''Hermenegildo'' and ''Real Carlos'' explode in the background after mistakenly firing on one other. Drawing by [[Antoine L\u00e9on Morel-Fatio]].]]\nTo the east of the combat between ''Superb'' and ''Saint Antoine'', the fire on ''Real Carlos'' blazed out of control, spreading throughout the ship. In the darkness, the blazing vessel stood out and was mistaken by the crew of ''San Hermenegildo'' for a British ship. Despite specific orders from Moreno for his captains to be sure of their targets, ''San Hermenegildo'' closed with the burning ship and fired several broadsides into ''Real Carlos''.<ref name=\"JM46\"/> The attack prompted a response and the two huge warships began a close exchange of fire that was only brought to a close when ''Real Carlos'' drifted into ''San Hermenegildo'', the flames spreading from the former's sails to the latter.<ref name=\"RG93\">Gardiner, p. 93</ref> Saumarez, on witnessing the sight, excitedly exclaimed to Brenton \"My God sir, look there! The day is ours!\"<ref name=\"JM47\">Musteen, p. 47</ref> Within minutes both ships were tangled together, fire spreading unchecked throughout the vessels. The fire was too dangerous for British ships to make any rescue attempts,<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=15392|pages=945\u2013946|date=3 August 1801}}</ref> and although several hundred men managed to escape the wrecks on small boats, there were still more than 1,700 sailors on board when first the ''Real Carlos'' at 00:15 and then the ''San Hermenegildo'' at 01:00 exploded as the flames reached their central magazines, killing both crews. 262 survivors in boats were taken aboard the captured ''Saint Antoine'' and 38 on ''Superb'', while a handful managed to reach the rest of the Franco-Spanish squadron,<ref name=\"WLC468\">Clowes, p. 468</ref> but the enormous loss of life in this incident was one of the worst maritime disasters to that time.<ref name=\"NM408\">Mostert, p. 408</ref>\n\n===''Venerable'' and ''Formidable''===\n[[File:Combat du Formidable.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|''Combat du Formidable'', [[Pierre-Julien Gilbert]], 1832|alt=]]\nWhile Keats had remained with his prize Saumarez had led the remainder of the squadron forward, although ''Audacious'' had been left far behind the rest of the British force. The French and Spanish ships had scattered as ''Superb'' attacked the rearguard and during the night each made their way separately to the rendezvous off Cadiz harbour.<ref name=\"JM47\"/> As dawn broke at 04:00 on 13 July, lookouts on the leading British ship of the line ''Venerable'' under Captain [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Samuel Hood]] spotted the French ship ''Formidable'', under the command of Captain [[Amable Troude]] in the absence of Linois, to the north. ''Formidable'' was trailing the rest of the squadron, close to the shore in [[Conil de la Frontera|Conil Bay]] to the south of Cadiz and north of [[Cape Trafalgar]]. The wind was light and coming from the land and so ''Caesar'' and ''Spencer'', the latter being a long way behind the others, were unable to approach the French ship and it was left to ''Venerable'' and ''Thames'', both inshore and therefore better able to make use of the wind, to lead the attack.<ref name=\"WJ128\"/> ''Formidable'' had only jury topmasts following the battle on 6 July, and so Hood was able to rapidly approach the French ship, coming under fire from Troude's stern guns at 05:15, Hood holding off from replying until 05:20 so as to not delay his progress. The light breeze was at that point in Hood's favour, and ''Venerable'' was able to come close alongside ''Formidable'' and open fire with a full broadside.<ref name=\"WLC468\"/> Off Cadiz, the remnants of Moreno's squadron formed up with the intention of sailing to ''Formidable''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s aid, but were struck by a calm and could only watch the battle to the south.<ref name=\"JM47\"/>\n\n''Venerable'' took the worst of the early action and at 05:30 the mizzen topmast was shot away. Hood responded by ordering Captain [[Aiskew Hollis]] in ''Thames'' to approach Troude's stern, the frigate repeatedly [[raking fire|raking]] the French ship under fire from the ineffective stern guns.<ref name=\"RG93\"/> For another hour the ships traded broadsides, until at 06:45 the mainmast of ''Venerable'' collapsed over the side, significantly retarding the ship's movement. ''Formidable'' was able to pull ahead slowly in the light and unreliable winds, continuing to fire the stern guns at the now immobile British ship.<ref name=\"WLC468\"/> ''Venerable'' was now drifting out of control, the foremast collapsing at 07:50 as the ship grounded on the shoals at [[Islote de Sancti Petri|Sancti Petri]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} south of Cadiz. With his main opponent disabled, Troude continued slowly towards Cadiz, out of range of the approaching ''Caesar''.<ref name=\"WJ129\">James, p. 129</ref>\n\nSaumarez sent Jahleel Brenton in a [[Captain's gig|gig]] to ''Venerable'' at 08:00, just as the foremast also fell overboard, with instructions that if the combined French and Spanish squadron, visible off Cadiz, should proceed south to attack the grounded British vessel then Hood should remove his crew and set his ship on fire. ''Thames'' was brought close alongside in order to evacuate the ship if the need arose, but Hood refused the order and insisted that he would be able to save his ship. Eventually the arrival of ''Audacious'' and ''Superb'' on the southern horizon decided the issue as Moreno abandoned any intention to counterattack, instead entering Cadiz harbour with his squadron, followed by Troude in ''Formidable''.<ref name=\"RG93\"/> Their arrival was greeted with cheers from the city's population, unaware of the disaster in the Gut of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"JM49\">Musteen, p. 49</ref> The confusion meant that the situations of the lost ships were unknown, and ''Saint Antoine''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s arrival was still anticipated at Cadiz as late as 16 July.<ref name=\"JM47\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Casualties===\nWith the immediate threat gone, Saumarez was able to direct his squadron's efforts to salvaging the battered and grounded ''Venerable''. The calm sea and light winds aided this operation, and at 14:00, assisted by ''Thames'' and the boats of ''Caesar'' and ''Spencer'', ''Venerable'' was once again afloat.<ref name=\"WJ129\"/> Hood's ship was taken under tow by first ''Thames'' and then ''Spencer'', the British squadron turning back towards Gibraltar at 18:00, the crew rigging a series of jury masts and sails to assist the process. By 08:00 on 14 July, ''Venerable'' was again able to sail independently, the squadron arriving at Gibraltar later that day.<ref name=\"WJ130\">James, p. 130</ref> At Gibraltar the returning squadron was greeted with cheers and a 21-gun salute.<ref name=\"JM49\"/> ''Spencer'', ''Audacious'' and ''Thames'' remained at sea off Cadiz to continue the blockade, which remained in place until the end of the French Revolutionary Wars in March 1802 at the [[Peace of Amiens]].\n\nBritish casualties had been relatively light, incurred almost entirely on ''Venerable'', which suffered 18 killed and 87 wounded. ''Superb'' had 15 men wounded including a lieutenant, all from the action with ''Saint Antoine'', while the only other ship directly engaged was ''Thames'', which hadn't lost a single man either killed or wounded. Apart from ''Venerable'' none of the other ships had suffered any significant damage, including ''Superb'' and ''Thames''. In the aftermath of the battle, Saumarez arranged a [[prisoner exchange]], the crew of ''Saint Antoine'' sent into Algeciras in return for the release of the crew of ''Hannibal''.<ref name=\"JM50\">Musteen, p. 50</ref> Losses among the combined squadron were drastically heavier: ''Formidable'' reported 20 killed and an unreported number of wounded and Saint Antoine's casualties were not reported at the time but were considered by later historians such as [[William James (naval historian)|William James]] to \"have been very severe\".<ref name=\"WJ129\"/> By far the biggest loss however was on board the two destroyed 112-gun ships, each of which had had a crew of roughly 1,000 men from which just over 300 are known to have escaped to other ships. The loss of more than 1,700 Spanish sailors in the battle was one of the most severe losses of life in a single maritime incident to that time.<ref name=\"NM408\"/>\n\nFinally, there was damage to two Spanish frigates: the ''Sabina'' was struck by cannon fire during the night killing one man and wounding five, although it was not determined which ship had fired on the flagship and James suggested that it may have been from one of the destroyed 112-gun ships in a case of [[friendly fire]].<ref name=\"WJ129\"/> In addition, the Spanish 34-gun frigate ''Perla'' was seen wallowing off the North African coast of the Strait of Gibraltar on the morning of 13 July, sinking later in the day due to severe damage. How ''Perla'' came to be engaged in the action has never been explained. The ship was not part of Moreno's squadron at Algeciras and none of the British ships reported engaging a frigate during the night \u2013 during the hours of darkness ''Perla'' must have encountered the battle and become caught in the cross-fire, suffering fatal damage.<ref name=\"WJ354\">James, p. 354</ref>\n\n===Effects===\nIn Britain the battle was celebrated, Saumarez having been deemed to have removed the stain of his defeat six days earlier in the battle in the Bay of Algeciras.

In a heavy engagement fought in calm weather in the close confines of [[Algeciras Bay]], the British force had been becalmed and battered, suffering heavy casualties and losing the 74-gun ship [[HMS Hannibal (1786)|HMS ''Hannibal'']]. Retiring for repairs, both sides called up reinforcements, the French receiving support first, from the Spanish fleet based at Cadiz, which sent six [[ships of the line]] to escort the French squadron to safety.\n\nArriving at Algeciras on 9 July, the combined squadron was ready to sail again on 12 July, departing Algeciras to the westwards during the evening. The British squadron under Rear-Admiral [[Sir James Saumarez]], having effected its own hasty repairs, set off in pursuit. Finding that his ships were falling behind, Saumarez instructed his captains to separate and attack the combined squadron as best they were able to. The fastest ship was [[HMS Superb (1798)|HMS ''Superb'']] under Captain [[Richard Goodwin Keats]], which sailed through the Spanish rearguard as a moonless night fell. ''Superb'' fired on the rearmost ships, setting the 112-gun [[Spanish ship Real Carlos (1787)|''Real Carlos'']] on fire and capturing the ''Saint Antoine''. Unable to determine friend from foe in the darkness, ''Real Carlos'' inadvertently engaged the Spanish ship [[Spanish ship San Hermenegildo (1789)|''San Hermenegildo'']], spreading the fire to its compatriot. Both ships subsequently exploded with enormous loss of life. A second stage of the battle then developed, as [[HMS Venerable (1784)|HMS ''Venerable'']] took the lead of the British line, attacking the rearmost French ship [[French ship Formidable (1795)|''Formidable'']] under Captain [[Amable Troude]]. In a furious and protracted engagement, ''Venerable'' suffered heavy damage and was driven ashore, allowing the remainder of the French force to return to Cadiz without further fighting.\n\nIn the aftermath of the action, ''Venerable'' was towed off the shoreline and back to Gibraltar for repairs, while the remainder of the British squadron restored the British [[blockade]] of the French and Spanish ships in Cadiz, returning the situation to that in place before the battle. This British victory, coming so soon after Saumarez's defeat in Algeciras harbour, did much to restore parity in the region and the heavy casualties inflicted on the Spanish were to contribute to a weakening of the Franco-Spanish alliance which was a contributory factor in the signing of [[Treaty of Amiens]], which brought the war to a temporary halt early the following year. In France, despite the heavy Spanish losses, the battle was celebrated as a victory, with Troude widely praised and promoted for the defence of his ship.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Algeciras campaign}}\n\n===First battle of Algeciras===\n{{main|First Battle of Algeciras}}\nIn August 1798, the French Mediterranean Fleet was largely destroyed by a British fleet at the [[Battle of the Nile]] during the [[French invasion of Egypt]]. With the [[Royal Navy]] dominant in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and their army trapped in [[Egypt]], the French sought in 1801 to augment their depleted forces in the region by sending reinforcements from the Atlantic Fleet and by purchasing ships from the [[Spanish Navy]], based in [[Cadiz]].<ref name=\"RW161\">Woodman, p. 161</ref> A [[Ganteaume's expeditions of 1801|squadron sailed]] from [[Brest, France|Brest]] on the Atlantic in January and made three failed attempts to reach Egypt, which was facing a large British invasion, before abandoning the effort and retiring to [[Toulon]] on the French Mediterranean coast. Three [[ships of the line]], [[French ship Formidable (1795)|''Formidable'']], [[French ship Indomptable (1789)|''Indomptable'']] and [[French ship Tyrannicide (1793)|''Desaix'']], had been detached from the squadron in May however and were subsequently placed under the command of Contre-Admiral [[Charles Linois]] under orders to sail for Cadiz.<ref name=\"WLC459\">Clowes, p. 459</ref> At Cadiz, the Spanish fleet had agreed to sell six ships of the line to the French Navy, and on 13 June two French [[frigates]], [[French ship Libre (1796)|''Libre'']] and [[French ship Indienne (1796)|''Indienne'']], arrived at the port to oversee the transfer under the command of Contre-Admiral [[Dumanoir le Pelley]].<ref name=\"WLC465\">Clowes, p. 465</ref>\n\n''En route'' to Cadiz, Linois had learned from the crew of the captured [[brig]] [[HMS Speedy (1782)|HMS ''Speedy'']] that a powerful British squadron of seven ships of the line under Rear-Admiral [[Sir James Saumarez]] lay off Cadiz, [[blockade|blockading]] the port. Concerned that this squadron could overwhelm his own, Linois took shelter in the small but well-defended harbour of [[Algeciras]], just across [[Algeciras Bay]] from the heavily fortified British naval base at [[Gibraltar]].<ref name=\"NM404\">Mostert, p. 404</ref> Saumarez was informed of Linois's arrival, and turned eastwards to confront him, discovering the French ships anchored in a well prepared position on the morning of 6 July. Saumarez attacked immediately, but found that his ships were hampered by a lack of wind. Becalmed under heavy fire, the British squadron inflicted severe damage on the French ships which withdrew into shallower water, two grounding. However, when Saumarez ordered his ships to follow, [[HMS Hannibal (1786)|HMS ''Hannibal'']] grounded as well, trapped under a heavy barrage from the shore.<ref name=\"WLC463\">Clowes, p. 463</ref> With no wind with which to manoeuvre and the [[ship's boat|squadron's boats]] all either sunk or engaged in towing the battered [[HMS Pomp\u00e9e (1793)|HMS ''Pomp\u00e9e'']] back to Gibraltar, Saumarez called off the attack at 13:35. The battered British squadron retired to Gibraltar, except for ''Hannibal'', which was trapped, battered and swiftly forced to surrender, having lost two masts and more than 140 men.<ref name=\"WJ118\">James, p. 118</ref>\n\n===Passage of Moreno===\nWith both squadrons badly damaged, reinforcements were called for, Linois sending a messenger overland to Cadiz with an appeal for the Spanish fleet there, under Admiral Don [[Jose de Mazarredo y Salazar|Jose de Mazzaredo]] to send a squadron to escort the French force in Algeciras to the safety of Cadiz.<ref name=\"WJ124\">James, p. 124</ref> At Cadiz, le Pelley had to plead with Mazzaredo for assistance, the Spanish admiral agreeing on 8 July to send a powerful squadron under Vice-Admiral Don {Juan Joaqu\u00edn Moreno de Mondrag\u00f3n to Algeciras. Moreno's force consisted of two 112-gun [[first rate]] ships of the line, [[Spanish ship Real Carlos (1787)|''Real Carlos'']] and [[Spanish ship San Hermenegildo (1789)|''San Hermenegildo'']], the 96-gun ''San Fernando'', 80-gun [[Spanish ship Argonauta|''Argonauta'']] and the 74-gun [[Spanish ship San Agust\u00edn (1768)|''San Agust\u00edn'']].<ref name=\"WLC466\"/> With this force was the 74-gun French ship ''Saint Antoine'', which a few days earlier had been the Spanish ''San Antonio''. ''Saint Antoine'' was the first of the French ships purchased from the Spanish Navy to enter service, the crew drawn from the crews of le Pelley's frigates supplemented by Spanish sailors and commanded by Commodore Julien le Ray. With the squadron were the frigates ''Libre'', ''Indienne'' and the Spanish ''Sabina'' as well as the French [[lugger]] ''Vautour''.<ref name=\"WJ126\">James, p. 126</ref>\n\nThe combined squadron sailed from Cadiz on 9 July, progressing rapidly southwards and reaching Algeciras Bay late in the afternoon, except for ''Saint Antoine'' which was delayed and arrived the following morning.<ref name=\"RG92\">Gardiner, p. 92</ref> The force was anchored close to Algeciras, well out of range of cannon at Gibraltar, and there waited for Linois to finish making the necessary repairs to his ships. Shadowing the combined squadron was a small British force under Captain [[Richard Goodwin Keats]] on [[HMS Superb (1798)|HMS ''Superb'']] with the frigate [[HMS Thames (1758)|HMS ''Thames'']] and the [[brig]] [[HMS Pasley|HMS ''Pasley'']]. Although part of Saumarez's squadron, Keats had been too late to take part in the first battle, and had instead cruised off Cadiz watching the Spanish fleet there. When Moreno sailed, Keats was initially chased by portions of the Franco-Spanish squadron, but eluded and followed them, subsequently joining Saumarez at Gibraltar.<ref name=\"WLC466\">Clowes, p. 466</ref> At the British port, the dockyards were the scene of frantic activity as Saumarez, supported by commissioner Captain [[Alexander Ball]], sought to repair his squadron so that it could intercept Moreno's forces on their voyage back to Cadiz. ''Pomp\u00e9e'' was temporarily abandoned in the yard, her crew redistributed to work on the rest of the squadron. Saumarez also gave orders that his flagship, [[HMS Caesar (1793)|HMS ''Caesar'']] was also to be left at Gibraltar, but Captain [[Jahleel Brenton]] requested the opportunity to repair his ship and Saumarez relented, the crew of ''Caesar'' working all day and in shifts throughout the night in order to bring their ship up to fighting standard.<ref name=\"WJ125\">James, p. 125</ref> Saumarez believed however that due to the condition of Linois's ships and the mistaken assumption that the combined squadron would sail for [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] to the east, he would have at least two weeks to prepare and sent messages to the Mediterranean Fleet under [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Lord Keith]], then at sea off Egypt, requesting support against the combined squadron.<ref name=\"JM43\">Musteen, p. 43</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n{{see also|Order of Battle in the Algeciras campaign}}\nOn 11 July the activity on Moreno's ships indicated to British observers at Gibraltar that the combined squadron was readying for sea, and the British working parties repairing Saumarez's squadron correspondingly redoubled their efforts. The arrival of a light easterly wind which would favour passage back to Cadiz encouraged both Moreno and Saumarez to prepare for departure to the Atlantic base on the following day.<ref name=\"NM406\">Mostert, p. 406</ref> At 12:00 on 12 July, ''Caesar'' [[Warping (sailing)|warped]] out of Gibraltar dockyard with her band playing the popular song \"[[Heart of Oak]]\" to the answering strains of \"[[Britons, Strike Home!]]\" from the dockside as crowds again turned out in their thousands to watch the coming battle.<ref name=\"NM407\">Mostert, p. 407</ref> By that time however, Moreno's forces were already at sea: at dawn on 12 July the leading Spanish ships loosed their sails and by 12:00 the French and Spanish squadron had begun to gather at their rendezvous point off Cabrita Point at the mouth of Algeciras Bay.<ref name=\"WJ126\"/> At 15:00, Saumarez set sail, his pennant flying from ''Caesar'' and followed by ships of the line ''Superb'', [[HMS Spencer (1800)|HMS ''Spencer'']], [[HMS Venerable (1784)|HMS ''Venerable'']] and [[HMS Audacious (1785)|HMS ''Audacious'']], frigates ''Thames'' and the Portuguese ''Carlotta'' and several smaller vessels.<ref name=\"WJ125\"/> Both Saumarez and Linois expected reinforcements sent by Lord Keith to arrive during the day, but none appeared.<ref name=\"JM44\">Musteen, p. 44</ref>\n\nAt 19:00, delayed by the effect of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] on the wind, the British squadron rounded Gibraltar and found the French and Spanish ships still assembling at Cabrita Point. The light wind prevented any rapid movement, and Saumarez began to slowly [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] towards the combined squadron in line of battle formation.<ref name=\"WJ126\"/> Moreno's departure had been delayed due to the state of the captured ''Hannibal'', renamed ''Annibal'', which was unable to make any progress under its [[jury masts]] and had been taken under tow by the frigate ''Indienne''. Sighting Saumarez's force, Moreno instructed ''Indienne'' and ''Hannibal'' to return to Algeciras and at 19:45 issued orders for the remainder of the squadron to sail west through the [[Gut of Gibraltar]] towards Cadiz.<ref name=\"WJ126\"/> He also, following Spanish naval tradition, disembarked his flagship ''Real Carlos'' and transferred to the frigate ''Sabina'', persuading Linois to quit ''Formidable'' and do the same.<ref name=\"WLC467\">Clowes, p. 467</ref>\n\n===''Superb'' and the rearguard===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \". . . the Spanish ships ''Real Carlos'', 112, and ''San Hermenegildo'', 112, mistaking each other for the aggressor, began a mutual attack, resulting in the ''Real Carlos'' losing her foretopmast, the sails of which \u2013 falling over her own guns \u2013 caught fire. While in this condition the ''Hermenegildo'' \u2013 still engaging the ''Real Carlos'' as an enemy \u2013 in the confusion fell on board her and caught fire also. Both ships burned until they blew up.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Commander [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]], Witness of the battle from Gibraltar.<ref name=\"RLA95\">Adkins, p. 95</ref>\n|}\nAt 20:00, Saumarez led his ships into the Gut after the combined squadron, but in the gathering dusk Moreno's squadron was already out of sight and the British admiral realised that his ships were too slow to catch the French and Spanish ships in their current formation before they reached the comparative safety of the open ocean.<ref name=\"NM407\"/> At 20:40, with the wind picking up, he therefore instructed the squadron to break formation and attack the rear of the combined squadron, directing his orders at Keats in ''Superb'', whose ship was the fastest.<ref name=\"RW161\">Woodman, p. 161</ref> Keats immediately set all sail and by 22:00 had regained sight of the combined squadron's rearguard, which consisted of the 112-gun ships and the ''Saint Antoine''. Behind, all Keats could see was ''Caesar'' and ''Venerable'' in the distance, and by 23:00 only ''Caesar'' was still in sight, more than {{convert|3|nmi|km}} behind ''Superb''.<ref name=\"WLC467\"/> Although he was now facing considerable odds, Keats steered ''Superb'' to within {{convert|350|yd|m}} of the ''Real Carlos'' at 23:20, coming under fire from all three vessels of the Franco-Spanish rearguard, although evading much of it by the simple tactic of not illuminating his ship so that the ships of the combined squadron fired on one another more than on their British opponent. Linois had also ordered his ships to extinguish their lights, but this only added to the confusion of the Spanish ships in the squadron.<ref name=\"JM46\"/> The moon had set and the night was quite dark, which contributed to the ineffectiveness of the Spanish gunnery.  ''Real Carlos'' fired randomly at the British ship but failed to strike it once during the brief engagement. Keats' ship was much more accurate however, firing three broadsides before ''Superb'' was carried beyond ''Real Carlos'' and towards ''Saint Antoine''. The British broadsides caused severe damage, knocking away the foretopmast and causing a fire to break out on the Spanish ship's deck following the third broadside.<ref name=\"RG92\"/> The fire grew rapidly and soon was so fierce that it could be plainly seen by observers at Gibraltar.<ref name=\"JM46\">Musteen, p. 46</ref>\n\nWith ''Real Carlos'' disabled, Keats pushed on into combat with ''Saint Antoine'', the combined French and Spanish crew engaging the British vessel as it approached.<ref name=\"LG1\"/> At 23:50, Keats laid his ship close alongside the new French ship, beginning a close and heated action as the ships of the line exchanged broadsides with one another in pitch darkness and with an increasing wind.<ref name=\"WLC467\"/> For 30 minutes the battle continued until, with the ships off [[Cape Spartel]] in North Africa, a wounded Le Ray decided that his ship was no longer able to contest the action and hailed ''Superb'' to announce that he had surrendered. The halyards that held up his pennant had however become tangled in the rigging, giving the appearance that the ship was still in French hands: this later led it to be attacked repeatedly by other British ships as they came up during the night.<ref name=\"WJ127\">James, p. 127</ref> ''Formidable'' was also to the rear of the combined squadron, escaping attack by feigning British signal lights until it had safely passed the battle between ''Superb'' and ''Saint Antoine''.<ref name=\"JM47\"/> Keats remained with his prize, awaiting the arrival of the rest of the squadron: ''Caesar'', ''Venerable'', ''Spencer'' and ''Thames'' arrived after midnight, all firing on ''Saint Antoine'' as they passed before continuing westwards in search of the remainder of Moreno's squadron. ''Superb'' was later joined by ''Carlotta'' and the small ships [[HMS Calpe (1800)|HMS ''Calpe'']] and ''Louisa'', which remained on hand during the night.<ref name=\"WJ128\">James, p. 128</ref>\n\n[[File:La Marine-Pacini-118.png|thumb|HMS ''Superb'' sails unnoticed off the Spanish fleet at Algeciras Bay, while the ''Hermenegildo'' and ''Real Carlos'' explode in the background after mistakenly firing on one other. Drawing by [[Antoine L\u00e9on Morel-Fatio]].]]\nTo the east of the combat between ''Superb'' and ''Saint Antoine'', the fire on ''Real Carlos'' blazed out of control, spreading throughout the ship. In the darkness, the blazing vessel stood out and was mistaken by the crew of ''San Hermenegildo'' for a British ship. Despite specific orders from Moreno for his captains to be sure of their targets, ''San Hermenegildo'' closed with the burning ship and fired several broadsides into ''Real Carlos''.<ref name=\"JM46\"/> The attack prompted a response and the two huge warships began a close exchange of fire that was only brought to a close when ''Real Carlos'' drifted into ''San Hermenegildo'', the flames spreading from the former's sails to the latter.<ref name=\"RG93\">Gardiner, p. 93</ref> Saumarez, on witnessing the sight, excitedly exclaimed to Brenton \"My God sir, look there! The day is ours!\"<ref name=\"JM47\">Musteen, p. 47</ref> Within minutes both ships were tangled together, fire spreading unchecked throughout the vessels. The fire was too dangerous for British ships to make any rescue attempts,<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=15392|pages=945\u2013946|date=3 August 1801}}</ref> and although several hundred men managed to escape the wrecks on small boats, there were still more than 1,700 sailors on board when first the ''Real Carlos'' at 00:15 and then the ''San Hermenegildo'' at 01:00 exploded as the flames reached their central magazines, killing both crews. 262 survivors in boats were taken aboard the captured ''Saint Antoine'' and 38 on ''Superb'', while a handful managed to reach the rest of the Franco-Spanish squadron,<ref name=\"WLC468\">Clowes, p. 468</ref> but the enormous loss of life in this incident was one of the worst maritime disasters to that time.<ref name=\"NM408\">Mostert, p. 408</ref>\n\n===''Venerable'' and ''Formidable''===\n[[File:Combat du Formidable.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|''Combat du Formidable'', [[Pierre-Julien Gilbert]], 1832|alt=]]\nWhile Keats had remained with his prize Saumarez had led the remainder of the squadron forward, although ''Audacious'' had been left far behind the rest of the British force. The French and Spanish ships had scattered as ''Superb'' attacked the rearguard and during the night each made their way separately to the rendezvous off Cadiz harbour.<ref name=\"JM47\"/> As dawn broke at 04:00 on 13 July, lookouts on the leading British ship of the line ''Venerable'' under Captain [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Samuel Hood]] spotted the French ship ''Formidable'', under the command of Captain [[Amable Troude]] in the absence of Linois, to the north. ''Formidable'' was trailing the rest of the squadron, close to the shore in [[Conil de la Frontera|Conil Bay]] to the south of Cadiz and north of [[Cape Trafalgar]]. The wind was light and coming from the land and so ''Caesar'' and ''Spencer'', the latter being a long way behind the others, were unable to approach the French ship and it was left to ''Venerable'' and ''Thames'', both inshore and therefore better able to make use of the wind, to lead the attack.<ref name=\"WJ128\"/> ''Formidable'' had only jury topmasts following the battle on 6 July, and so Hood was able to rapidly approach the French ship, coming under fire from Troude's stern guns at 05:15, Hood holding off from replying until 05:20 so as to not delay his progress. The light breeze was at that point in Hood's favour, and ''Venerable'' was able to come close alongside ''Formidable'' and open fire with a full broadside.<ref name=\"WLC468\"/> Off Cadiz, the remnants of Moreno's squadron formed up with the intention of sailing to ''Formidable''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s aid, but were struck by a calm and could only watch the battle to the south.<ref name=\"JM47\"/>\n\n''Venerable'' took the worst of the early action and at 05:30 the mizzen topmast was shot away. Hood responded by ordering Captain [[Aiskew Hollis]] in ''Thames'' to approach Troude's stern, the frigate repeatedly [[raking fire|raking]] the French ship under fire from the ineffective stern guns.<ref name=\"RG93\"/> For another hour the ships traded broadsides, until at 06:45 the mainmast of ''Venerable'' collapsed over the side, significantly retarding the ship's movement. ''Formidable'' was able to pull ahead slowly in the light and unreliable winds, continuing to fire the stern guns at the now immobile British ship.<ref name=\"WLC468\"/> ''Venerable'' was now drifting out of control, the foremast collapsing at 07:50 as the ship grounded on the shoals at [[Islote de Sancti Petri|Sancti Petri]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} south of Cadiz. With his main opponent disabled, Troude continued slowly towards Cadiz, out of range of the approaching ''Caesar''.<ref name=\"WJ129\">James, p. 129</ref>\n\nSaumarez sent Jahleel Brenton in a [[Captain's gig|gig]] to ''Venerable'' at 08:00, just as the foremast also fell overboard, with instructions that if the combined French and Spanish squadron, visible off Cadiz, should proceed south to attack the grounded British vessel then Hood should remove his crew and set his ship on fire. ''Thames'' was brought close alongside in order to evacuate the ship if the need arose, but Hood refused the order and insisted that he would be able to save his ship. Eventually the arrival of ''Audacious'' and ''Superb'' on the southern horizon decided the issue as Moreno abandoned any intention to counterattack, instead entering Cadiz harbour with his squadron, followed by Troude in ''Formidable''.<ref name=\"RG93\"/> Their arrival was greeted with cheers from the city's population, unaware of the disaster in the Gut of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"JM49\">Musteen, p. 49</ref> The confusion meant that the situations of the lost ships were unknown, and ''Saint Antoine''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s arrival was still anticipated at Cadiz as late as 16 July.<ref name=\"JM47\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Casualties===\nWith the immediate threat gone, Saumarez was able to direct his squadron's efforts to salvaging the battered and grounded ''Venerable''. The calm sea and light winds aided this operation, and at 14:00, assisted by ''Thames'' and the boats of ''Caesar'' and ''Spencer'', ''Venerable'' was once again afloat.<ref name=\"WJ129\"/> Hood's ship was taken under tow by first ''Thames'' and then ''Spencer'', the British squadron turning back towards Gibraltar at 18:00, the crew rigging a series of jury masts and sails to assist the process. By 08:00 on 14 July, ''Venerable'' was again able to sail independently, the squadron arriving at Gibraltar later that day.<ref name=\"WJ130\">James, p. 130</ref> At Gibraltar the returning squadron was greeted with cheers and a 21-gun salute.<ref name=\"JM49\"/> ''Spencer'', ''Audacious'' and ''Thames'' remained at sea off Cadiz to continue the blockade, which remained in place until the end of the French Revolutionary Wars in March 1802 at the [[Peace of Amiens]].\n\nBritish casualties had been relatively light, incurred almost entirely on ''Venerable'', which suffered 18 killed and 87 wounded. ''Superb'' had 15 men wounded including a lieutenant, all from the action with ''Saint Antoine'', while the only other ship directly engaged was ''Thames'', which hadn't lost a single man either killed or wounded. Apart from ''Venerable'' none of the other ships had suffered any significant damage, including ''Superb'' and ''Thames''. In the aftermath of the battle, Saumarez arranged a [[prisoner exchange]], the crew of ''Saint Antoine'' sent into Algeciras in return for the release of the crew of ''Hannibal''.<ref name=\"JM50\">Musteen, p. 50</ref> Losses among the combined squadron were drastically heavier: ''Formidable'' reported 20 killed and an unreported number of wounded and Saint Antoine's casualties were not reported at the time but were considered by later historians such as [[William James (naval historian)|William James]] to \"have been very severe\".<ref name=\"WJ129\"/> By far the biggest loss however was on board the two destroyed 112-gun ships, each of which had had a crew of roughly 1,000 men from which just over 300 are known to have escaped to other ships. The loss of more than 1,700 Spanish sailors in the battle was one of the most severe losses of life in a single maritime incident to that time.<ref name=\"NM408\"/>\n\nFinally, there was damage to two Spanish frigates: the ''Sabina'' was struck by cannon fire during the night killing one man and wounding five, although it was not determined which ship had fired on the flagship and James suggested that it may have been from one of the destroyed 112-gun ships in a case of [[friendly fire]].<ref name=\"WJ129\"/> In addition, the Spanish 34-gun frigate ''Perla'' was seen wallowing off the North African coast of the Strait of Gibraltar on the morning of 13 July, sinking later in the day due to severe damage. How ''Perla'' came to be engaged in the action has never been explained. The ship was not part of Moreno's squadron at Algeciras and none of the British ships reported engaging a frigate during the night \u2013 during the hours of darkness ''Perla'' must have encountered the battle and become caught in the cross-fire, suffering fatal damage.<ref name=\"WJ354\">James, p. 354</ref>\n\n===Effects===\nIn Britain the battle was celebrated, Saumarez having been deemed to have removed the stain of his defeat six days earlier in the battle in the Bay of Algeciras. He was awarded the thanks of both [[Houses of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Houses of Parliament]] and, already a [[Knight Bachelor]], made a [[Knight of the Bath]] with a pension of \u00a31,200 annually (the equivalent of \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1200|1801|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}} The first lieutenants of ''Caesar'', ''Superb'' and ''Venerable'' were promoted to commander and the captured ''Saint Antoine'' was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS ''San Antonio'', although the age and small size of the ship meant that she was never suited to front line service and was instead stationed permanently at [[Portsmouth]].<ref name=\"WJ130\"/> Nearly five decades later, the second battle was among the actions recognised by the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]], awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.<ref name=\"LG4\">{{London Gazette|issue=20939|pages=236\u2013245|date=26 January 1849}}</ref>\n\nIn France the battle was represented as a victory, largely based on a report sent to [[Paris]] by Dumanoir le Pelley on the strength of a letter written by Captain Troude, which claimed that he had fought not only ''Venerable'' and ''Thames'', but also ''Caesar'' and ''Spencer'' (misidentified in the report as ''Superb'').<ref name=\"WJ131\">James, p. 131</ref> Troude claimed that he had not only driven all of these ships off and completely destroyed ''Venerable'' by driving the ship ashore by 07:00, but that he had then waited nearby until 10:00 in the hope of resuming the action. In reward for his services as represented, Troude was promoted and highly praised, later holding a number of important active commands in the French Navy.<ref name=\"WLC469\">Clowes, p. 469</ref>\n\nThe outcome of the battle, reversing the British defeat of 6 July, inflicting severe losses on the Spanish fleet at Cadiz and trapping Linois in Cadiz proved decisive in confirming British control of the Mediterranean Sea. With the French plan to reinforce the army stranded in Egypt in ruins, the British invasion fleet was free to operate without interference, succeeding in capturing the country in September 1801.<ref name=\"NM409\">Mostert, p. 409</ref> In a wider sense too, it emphasized the degree to which the Royal Navy dominated European waters, destroying any attempt by the navies of France and its allies to conduct operations at sea.<ref name=\"WLC470\">Clowes, p. 470</ref> In Spain the government, furious at the losses suffered for so little gain, began to distance themselves from the alliance with France, which was a contributing factor in the signing of the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in March 1802 that ended the French Revolutionary Wars.<ref name=\"NR472\">Rodger, p. 472</ref> For the remainder of the war the British maintained undisputed control of the Mediterranean Sea and the Spanish coast, the Cadiz blockade preventing the French and Spanish forces there from putting to sea.<ref name=\"NM409\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Adkins\n | first = Roy & Lesley\n | authorlink =\n | year = 2006\n | chapter =\n | title = The War for All the Oceans\n | publisher = Abacus\n | location =\n | isbn = 978-0-349-11916-8\n}}\n* {{cite book | last = Clowes| first = William Laird| authorlink = William Laird Clowes| year = 1997| origyear= 1900| chapter = | title = The Royal Navy, A History from the Earliest Times to 1900, Volume IV| publisher = Chatham Publishing| location = London| isbn = 1-86176-013-2}}\n* {{cite book| author = Gardiner, Robert (editor)| authorlink = | year = 2001| origyear= 1996| chapter =| title = Nelson Against Napoleon| publisher = Caxton Editions| location = | isbn = 1-86176-026-4}}\n* {{cite book| last = James| first = William| authorlink = William James (naval historian)| year = 2002| origyear= 1827| chapter = | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 3, 1800\u20131805 | publisher = Conway Maritime Press| location = London| isbn = 0-85177-907-7}}\n* {{wikicite|id=Mostert|reference=Mostert, Noel (2007).
