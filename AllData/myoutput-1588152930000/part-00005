An increase of $0\u2013$500 per capita income to $500\u2013$1000 per capita income can lead to a decrease in child labour incidence rate from 30%\u201360% to 10%\u201330%.<ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /> Although the annual per capita income of Bangladesh has been increasing, around 9\u201313% of the total labour force in Bangladesh still consists of children aged 5\u201314.<ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /><ref name=\"Salmon2005\" /><ref name=\"Rahman1999\" /> In a 2013 statistical report, UNICEF estimates that around 43.3% of the population in Bangladesh is currently living below the international poverty line.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/bangladesh_bangladesh_statistics.html |title=Bangladesh: Statistics |date=18 December 2013 |website=UNICEF |accessdate = 15 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nFactors such as urbanization and population growth perpetuate poverty.<ref name=\"Rahman1999\" /> In a 2013 statistical report, UNICEF estimated an annual population growth rate in Bangladesh to be 1.7% from 1990\u20132012.<ref name=\":5\" /> Populations move from rural to urban areas because there is an increase in available economic opportunities. A combination of poor living standards in urban settings and an influx of cheap labour from children perpetuate both poverty and the use of child labour.<ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /><ref name=\"Rahman1999\" /> The prevalence of child labour can be attributed to the socioeconomic statuses of families living at or below the poverty line. Oftentimes, families rely on the extra income produced by their children in order to sustain their livelihood. Many children are forced to work to help support the family. In other cases, children are forced to work for a living for themselves because their families abandoned or could not take care of them. Studies have shown that children from poorer families are more likely to be in the work force due to their contribution to overall family income.<ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /><ref name=\"Salmon2005\" /><ref name=\"Rahman1999\" />\n\n===Demographics===\n[[File:Boys in red.jpg|thumb|Boys covered with mercury-containing red [[vermilion]] chemical during child labour in a factory producing [[sindoor]].]]\nThe [[demographics of Bangladesh|demographics of the population in Bangladesh]] can also be a predictor of child labour incidence rates. Children in rural areas are more likely to work than children in urban areas.<ref name=\"Salmon2005\" /> This may be due to the agricultural history of Bangladesh and the tradition of children working alongside adults in the fields.<ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /> However, in both rural and urban settings, boys are more likely to work than girls, with the majority of child workers falling in the age range of 12\u201314.<ref name=\"Rahman1999\" />\n\nFamily dynamics also contributed to child labour incidence rates. Children in households with a large proportion of adults in the family are less likely to work. Children in households where all adults are working are more likely to work. Children in households where there is a larger portion of paid adult workers are even more likely to work. These findings by Salmon (2005) indicate that children act as a source of income generation because households that maximise all human capital tend to be households that have incidences of child labour.<ref name=\"Salmon2005\" />\n\n===Lack of education===\n{{main|Education in Bangladesh}}\n[[File:Community Box Library in Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|left|Community Box Library in Bangladesh]]\nLack of education remains one of the top impacts of child labour.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /><ref name=\"ILO2006\" /><ref name=\"Salmon2005\" /><ref name=\"Rahman1999\" /><ref name=\"HobbsMcKechnie1999\" /> Child labour is a deterrent to schooling.<ref name=\"BDRC2009\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshstudies.org/files/WPS_no8.pdf |title=Physical and Psychological Implications of Risky Child Labor: A Study in Sylhet City, Bangladesh |last1=Uddin |first1=Mohammad Nashir |last2=Hamiduzzaman |first2=Mohammad |last3=Gunter |first3=Bernhard G. |date=July 2009 |website=Bangladesh Development Research Center (BDRC)}}</ref> Many policies aimed at eradicating child labour have focused on increasing accessibility to education.

An increase of $0\u2013$500 per capita income to $500\u2013$1000 per capita income can lead to a decrease in child labour incidence rate from 30%\u201360% to 10%\u201330%.<ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /> Although the annual per capita income of Bangladesh has been increasing, around 9\u201313% of the total labour force in Bangladesh still consists of children aged 5\u201314.<ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /><ref name=\"Salmon2005\" /><ref name=\"Rahman1999\" /> In a 2013 statistical report, UNICEF estimates that around 43.3% of the population in Bangladesh is currently living below the international poverty line.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/bangladesh_bangladesh_statistics.html |title=Bangladesh: Statistics |date=18 December 2013 |website=UNICEF |accessdate = 15 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nFactors such as urbanization and population growth perpetuate poverty.<ref name=\"Rahman1999\" /> In a 2013 statistical report, UNICEF estimated an annual population growth rate in Bangladesh to be 1.7% from 1990\u20132012.<ref name=\":5\" /> Populations move from rural to urban areas because there is an increase in available economic opportunities. A combination of poor living standards in urban settings and an influx of cheap labour from children perpetuate both poverty and the use of child labour.<ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /><ref name=\"Rahman1999\" /> The prevalence of child labour can be attributed to the socioeconomic statuses of families living at or below the poverty line. Oftentimes, families rely on the extra income produced by their children in order to sustain their livelihood. Many children are forced to work to help support the family. In other cases, children are forced to work for a living for themselves because their families abandoned or could not take care of them. Studies have shown that children from poorer families are more likely to be in the work force due to their contribution to overall family income.<ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /><ref name=\"Salmon2005\" /><ref name=\"Rahman1999\" />\n\n===Demographics===\n[[File:Boys in red.jpg|thumb|Boys covered with mercury-containing red [[vermilion]] chemical during child labour in a factory producing [[sindoor]].]]\nThe [[demographics of Bangladesh|demographics of the population in Bangladesh]] can also be a predictor of child labour incidence rates. Children in rural areas are more likely to work than children in urban areas.<ref name=\"Salmon2005\" /> This may be due to the agricultural history of Bangladesh and the tradition of children working alongside adults in the fields.<ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /> However, in both rural and urban settings, boys are more likely to work than girls, with the majority of child workers falling in the age range of 12\u201314.<ref name=\"Rahman1999\" />\n\nFamily dynamics also contributed to child labour incidence rates. Children in households with a large proportion of adults in the family are less likely to work. Children in households where all adults are working are more likely to work. Children in households where there is a larger portion of paid adult workers are even more likely to work. These findings by Salmon (2005) indicate that children act as a source of income generation because households that maximise all human capital tend to be households that have incidences of child labour.<ref name=\"Salmon2005\" />\n\n===Lack of education===\n{{main|Education in Bangladesh}}\n[[File:Community Box Library in Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|left|Community Box Library in Bangladesh]]\nLack of education remains one of the top impacts of child labour.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /><ref name=\"ILO2006\" /><ref name=\"Salmon2005\" /><ref name=\"Rahman1999\" /><ref name=\"HobbsMcKechnie1999\" /> Child labour is a deterrent to schooling.<ref name=\"BDRC2009\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshstudies.org/files/WPS_no8.pdf |title=Physical and Psychological Implications of Risky Child Labor: A Study in Sylhet City, Bangladesh |last1=Uddin |first1=Mohammad Nashir |last2=Hamiduzzaman |first2=Mohammad |last3=Gunter |first3=Bernhard G. |date=July 2009 |website=Bangladesh Development Research Center (BDRC)}}</ref> Many policies aimed at eradicating child labour have focused on increasing accessibility to education.

The effects of microcredit are not large enough to change the lives of an entire population. However, it has been shown to allow families in poverty to find a way out.<ref name=\"BanerjeeDuflo2011\" /><ref name=\"Jahiruddin2011\" /> BRAC has also been responsible for running schools for non-formal education that were put in place to teach children fired from jobs. These non-formal schools also gave children another option besides schooling. Along with the schooling program, families also received health care services and monthly cash stipends to make up for the wages their children were not bringing in by participating in the schooling program.<ref name=\"Hasan2007\" />\n\n;Other strategies\n\nIn addition to the work of the government, BRAC, and ILO, there have been a number of contributions from international organizations and donors to help start strategies against child labour. These strategies include: taking children out of hazardous work environments and placing them in schooling or training programs, giving families stipends to compensate for loss in wages from a decrease in child labour, and raising awareness of the harmful effects of child labour.<ref name=\"Hasan2007\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Children's rights movement]]\n* [[Guaranteed minimum income]]\n* [[International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour]], IPEC\n* [[IREWOC]] - Institute for Research on Working Children\n* [[Legal working age]]\n* [[Multinational corporation]]\n* [[Street children]]\n* [[Wage Slavery]]\n* [[Youth activism]]\n* [[Bangladesh textile industry]]\n* [[Steel industry in Bangladesh]]\n* [[Fishing in Bangladesh]]\n* [[Jute trade]]\n'''International conventions and other instruments:'''\n* [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Timmerman |first=Kelsey |date=2009 |title=Where am I wearing?
