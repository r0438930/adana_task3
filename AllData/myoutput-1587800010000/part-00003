William paid the Danes to go home, but the remaining rebels refused to meet him in battle, and he decided to starve them out by laying waste to the northern shires using [[scorched earth]] tactics, especially in the city of [[York]], before relieving the English aristocracy of their positions, and installing Norman aristocrats throughout the region.\n\nContemporary chronicles vividly record the savagery of the campaign, the huge scale of the destruction and the widespread famine caused by looting, burning and slaughtering. Some present-day scholars have labelled the campaigns a [[genocide]], although others doubt whether William could have assembled enough troops to inflict so much damage and have suggested that the records may have been exaggerated or misinterpreted. Records from the [[Domesday Book]] show that 75% of the population died or never returned. \n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Gwynedd in the High Middle Ages#Mathrafal ascendency and English alliances; 1063\u20131081|l1=Gwynedd's alliance with Mercia and Northumbria}}\nAt the time of the Norman Conquest ''the North'' consisted of what became [[Yorkshire]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], and [[Northumberland]] in the east and [[Lancashire]] with the southern parts of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]] in the west.<ref name=kapell5>William E.

Copsi had fought in [[Harald Hardrada]]'s army with Tostig, against Harold Godwinson at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] in 1066. He had managed to escape after Harald's defeat.

He goes on to say that it is highly unlikely that such plans could have resulted from piecemeal additions and must have been necessary after the Harrying of the North.  The dating is thought to be secure as it is known that Norman lords used similar regular plans in founding new towns in the 'plantation' of rural settlements in other conquered parts of the British Isles.<ref name=oup126>Hey.

William paid the Danes to go home, but the remaining rebels refused to meet him in battle, and he decided to starve them out by laying waste to the northern shires using [[scorched earth]] tactics, especially in the city of [[York]], before relieving the English aristocracy of their positions, and installing Norman aristocrats throughout the region.\n\nContemporary chronicles vividly record the savagery of the campaign, the huge scale of the destruction and the widespread famine caused by looting, burning and slaughtering. Some present-day scholars have labelled the campaigns a [[genocide]], although others doubt whether William could have assembled enough troops to inflict so much damage and have suggested that the records may have been exaggerated or misinterpreted. Records from the [[Domesday Book]] show that 75% of the population died or never returned. \n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Gwynedd in the High Middle Ages#Mathrafal ascendency and English alliances; 1063\u20131081|l1=Gwynedd's alliance with Mercia and Northumbria}}\nAt the time of the Norman Conquest ''the North'' consisted of what became [[Yorkshire]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], and [[Northumberland]] in the east and [[Lancashire]] with the southern parts of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]] in the west.<ref name=kapell5>William E.

Copsi had fought in [[Harald Hardrada]]'s army with Tostig, against Harold Godwinson at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] in 1066. He had managed to escape after Harald's defeat.

He goes on to say that it is highly unlikely that such plans could have resulted from piecemeal additions and must have been necessary after the Harrying of the North.

The new aristocracy in England was predominately of Norman extraction; however, one exception was that of [[Alan Rufus]], a trusted [[Breton people|Breton]] lord, who obtained in 1069\u20131071 a substantial fiefdom in North Yorkshire, which the [[Domesday Book]] calls \"the Hundred of the Land of Count Alan\", later known as [[Richmondshire]].<ref name=barlow114>Frank Barlow, ''The Feudal Kingdom of England, 1042\u20131216'' (London; New York: Longmans, Green, 1955, OCLC 1068326489 ), pg. 114, [https://www.questia.com/read/91383886 Questia.com] accessdate 27 August 2013.

Alan also exercised patronage in York, where he founded [[St Mary's Abbey, York|St Mary's Abbey]] in 1088. By 1086 Alan was one of the richest and most powerful men in England.<ref name=ODNB>Keats-Rohan \"[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/52358 Alan Rufus (died 1093)]\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''; retrieved 27 August 2013.{{paywall}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Scotland]], Malcolm married the \u00c6theling's sister, [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]], in 1071.<ref name=\"stenton606\"/> Edgar sought Malcolm's assistance in his struggle against William.<ref name=horspool10 /> The marriage of Malcolm to Edgar's sister profoundly affected the history of both England and Scotland. The influence of Margaret and her sons brought about the Anglicisation of the Lowlands and provided the Scottish king with an excuse for forays into England, which he could claim were to redress the wrongs against his brother-in-law.<ref name=poole266>Poole, pg. 266.</ref>\n\nThe formal link between the royal house of Scotland and [[Wessex]] was a threat to William, who marched up to Scotland in 1072 to confront the Scottish king. The two kings negotiated the [[Treaty of Abernethy]] (1072), through which, according to the ''Anglo Saxon Chronicle'', Malcolm became William's vassal; among the other provisions was the expulsion of Edgar \u00c6theling from the Scottish court.<ref name=asc1072/><ref name=huscroft61>Huscroft.

In response, William sent his half-brother [[Odo, Bishop of Bayeux]] north with an army to harry the Northumbrian countryside. Odo destroyed much land north of the Tees, from York to Durham, and stole valuable items from Durham monastery. Many of the Northumbrian nobility were driven into exile.<ref>Rollason. ''Libellus de Exordio.'' pp. 218\u201320.</ref>\n\nAs a result of the depopulation, Norman landowners sought settlers to work in the fields. Evidence suggests that such barons were willing to rent lands to any men not obviously disloyal. Unlike the [[Vikings]] in the centuries before, Normans did not settle wholesale in the shire, but only occupied the upper ranks of society. This allowed an Anglo-Scandinavian culture to survive beneath Norman rule. Evidence for continuity can be seen in the retention of many cultural traits:{{quote|Many personal names of a pre-conquest character appear in charters that date from the 11th to the 13th century. The vigorous northern literary tradition in the Middle English period and its distinctive dialect also suggest the survival of an Anglo-Scandinavian population. The relative scarcity of Norman place-names implies that the new settlers came in only at the top rank. Domesday Book shows that at this level, however, Norman takeover in Yorkshire was virtually complete.<ref name=hey19>Hey.

There had been no monasteries north of [[Burton upon Trent]] before the harrying.<ref name=harper171/> \nFrom the Norman point of view, the Harrying of the North was a successful strategy, as large areas, including [[Cheshire]], [[Shropshire]], [[Derbyshire]] and [[Staffordshire]] were devastated, and the Domesday Book confirms this, although in those counties it was not as complete as in Yorkshire. The object of the harrying was to prevent further revolts in [[Mercia]] and Northumbria; however, it did not prevent rebellions elsewhere.<ref name=stenton605>Stenton.
