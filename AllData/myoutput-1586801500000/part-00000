{"title_page": "Climate communication", "text_new": "'''Climate communication''' or '''climate change communication''' is a field of [[environmental communication]]s and [[science communication]] focused on facilitating the communications of the effects of [[Global warming|anthropogenic climate change]]. Most climate communication focuses on bringing knowledge from the scientific consensus on the impact of climate change to a broader public.\n\nThe field of climate communication explores two main areas: the efficacy of existing communications strategies, and supporting the development of recommendations for improving that communication. Improving climate change communication has become the focus of several major research institutes, such as the [[Yale Program on Climate Change Communication]] and Climate Outreach in the UK, as well as major international organizations, such as the IPCC and [[UN Climate Change Secretariat]], and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s.\n\n== History ==\nIn her Encyclopedia article in Oxford's Communications Research Encyclopedia, scholar Amy E.
