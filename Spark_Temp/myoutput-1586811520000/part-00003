He played for six different teams, most notably the [[Oakland Athletics]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]], before short stints with the [[Houston Astros]], [[San Diego Padres]], [[San Francisco Giants]], and [[Kansas City Royals]].\n\nTejada spent his first six seasons in MLB with the Athletics, where he began a streak of 1,152 [[Major League Baseball consecutive games played streaks|consecutive game]]s that ended with the Orioles on June 22, 2007. He is a six-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] and a two-time [[Silver Slugger Award]] winner.

He grew up idolizing the Baltimore Orioles shortstop [[Cal Ripken Jr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3079-2004Feb24.html |title=Tejada Looks to Build on Ripken Legacy |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2004-02-24 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref> \nTejada's rise from the slums of Ban\u00ed through the minors and into the Major Leagues is chronicled in the book ''Away Games: The Life and Times of a Latin Ballplayer'' by Marcos Breton and Jose Luis Villegas. ''Away Games'' describes the struggles of Dominican players in general and Tejada in particular as they arrive in the U.S. speaking very little English, often in small towns playing for minor league teams, with dreams of making it big.<ref>{{Cite book|title=page for Away Games |isbn = 978-0684849911|last1 = Bret\u00f3n|first1 = Marcos|last2= Villegas|first2= Jos\u00e9 Luis|year=1999 }}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Oakland Athletics (1997\u20132003)===\n\n====1997\u20132001====\nTejada developed quickly into a top-notch prospect, showing early signs of power. He reached the Majors towards the end of the [[1997 Major League Baseball season|1997 season]], joining a struggling Oakland Athletics club. Though he only hit .202 in 26 games that year, the A's saw potential in the 23-year-old Tejada. This was bolstered by his performance with the [[Edmonton Trappers]] (AAA) in the [[Pacific Coast League]] during the season, and returning to the minors to lead the Trappers to a PCL championship that year. He was rewarded with the starting shortstop job beginning in [[1998 Major League Baseball season|1998]].\n\nThe A's, and Tejada, steadily improved over the next two years. His hitting improved as he gained more discipline at the plate. In 1998, he hit .233 with 11 [[home run]]s and in [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999]] his average jumped to .251 with 21 home runs.\n\nAfter a solid 87-win campaign in 1999, Tejada and a core of young players led their A's to their first [[American League Western Division]] title in eight years in [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000]]. Bolstered by an [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|American League MVP]]-winning performance by [[first baseman]] [[Jason Giambi]], and aided by Tejada's .275 average and 30 home runs, the A's won 91 games. The [[2000 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] faced the [[2000 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in the [[2000 American League Division Series|first round of the postseason]], which was won by the Yankees 3-2.\n\nIn [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]], Tejada had a comparable offensive year, hitting .267 with 31 homers. The [[2001 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] captured the American League [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] with a 102-60 record. In the [[2001 American League Division Series|postseason]], however, the A's fell to the [[2001 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in five games, blowing an initial 2-0 series lead.\n\n====2002====\nTejada's breakout year came in [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002]]. With the departure of Jason Giambi to the [[New York Yankees]] during the offseason, and a leg injury to slugger [[Jermaine Dye]], the A's lost two of their key offensive players. Tejada hit .308 with 34 homers and led the [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] to their second Western Division title in three years. Their campaign included an American League record 20 game winning-streak. Tejada contributed one-out, game-winning hits in the 18th and 19th games of that run: a three-run homer off [[Minnesota Twins]] closer [[Eddie Guardado]] for a 7-5 victory and a bases-loaded single against [[2002 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] reliever [[Jason Grimsley]] to break a 6-6 tie. Tejada also showed modest speed on the basepaths with 18 steals over a two-year stretch. His performance was rewarded with the 2002 American League MVP award. For the third straight year, though, the A's fell in the fifth game of the [[2002 American League Division Series|ALDS]], this time to the [[2002 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].\n\n====2003====\nThe [[2003 Major League Baseball season|next year]], both the [[2003 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] and Tejada got off to a slow start, with the shortstop hitting under [[Mendoza line|.200]] for the first month of the season. Improved play in the second half of the season led the A's to their second straight Western Division title and their third in four years. Tejada hit .278 with 27 homers for the year, a decrease from his numbers in 2002, but still leading many offensive categories for shortstops.\n\n[[File:M Tejada - Orioles v Yanks 2007-07-29.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Tejada during his first tenure with the [[2007 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles in 2007]]]]\nIn a [[2003 American League Division Series|tension-filled series]], the powerful offense of the [[2003 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] narrowly edged out the A's in the first round, once again in five games. Tejada was known for his public display of anger toward Boston starting pitcher [[Derek Lowe]] at the series' conclusion for what he perceived as obscene gestures. Lowe denied the accusation, claiming his fist pump was in celebration only.<ref>{{cite web|last=Christensen|first2=Roch|last2=Kubatko|first=Joe|title=Tejada, Lowe say ALDS feud is in past|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-04-07/sports/0404070346_1_mazzilli-tejada-derek-lowe|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=May 18, 2014|date=April 7, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=AL: A's irate about Lowe's gesture|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/10/07/Sports/AL__A_s_irate_about_L.shtml|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=May 18, 2014|date=October 7, 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Baltimore Orioles (2004\u20132007)===\nBy the end of the 2003 season, Tejada had established himself as one of baseball's premier shortstops. The A's elected not to re-sign the free agent, citing budget concerns and a young [[Bobby Crosby]] coming through the system, so Tejada signed a six-year, $72 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles during the offseason.\n\nOn arrival in Baltimore, Tejada was given uniform number 10, since 4, his number in Oakland, had been retired for former manager [[Earl Weaver]]. As an Oriole, Tejada followed in the footsteps of legendary Baltimore shortstop [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]. Like Ripken, Tejada was a strong and durable shortstop with unusual power numbers for a middle infielder.\n\n====2004\u20132005====\nOn July 12, 2004, Tejada won the [[Century 21 Real Estate|Century 21]] [[Home Run Derby]] in [[Houston]]. Tejada hit a (then) record 27 [[home run]]s in the contest, including a record 15 homers in the second round. He defeated [[Houston Astros]] outfielder [[Lance Berkman]] (who would later become his teammate) 5-4 in the final round of the contest.<ref>{{cite web |last=Antonen |first=Mel |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/allstar/2004-07-12-homerun-derby_x.htm |title=Tejada blasts way to victory in Derby |work=USA Today |date=July 12, 2004 |accessdate=April 9, 2016}}</ref> Both records were broken the following year in [[Detroit]] by [[Bobby Abreu]]. Tejada finished the 2004 season with 34 home runs and an MLB-leading 150 RBIs, and won his first career [[Silver Slugger Award]].\n\nWhile Tejada did not participate in the Home Run Derby in 2005, he was an [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] and starter for the [[American League|AL]]. In his first All-Star start, Tejada hit a solo [[home run]] against [[John Smoltz]] of the [[Atlanta Braves]], had a sacrifice RBI and was part of an all-Oriole double play with teammate [[Brian Roberts (baseball)|Brian Roberts]]. His efforts earned him the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP]], winning a [[Chevrolet Corvette]].\n\n====2005\u20132006 offseason====\nOn December 8, 2005, it was widely reported by the [[Associated Press]] that Tejada asked the Orioles for a trade, citing unhappiness with the team's direction. Tejada challenged those statements in an interview with [[Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic|Comcast Sportsnet's]] Kelli Johnson, saying he only asked for a better team, referring to his hope that the Baltimore Orioles would improve after their eighth straight losing season.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nSeveral weeks later, Tejada reiterated his complaints with the Orioles' lack of action and demanded to be traded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Tejada stated that he wants a \"good group that helps me to win\" and commented briefly on his alleged non-involvement in Palmeiro's steroid scandal.  On January 7, 2006, Tejada stated his intent to remain with Baltimore for \"the rest of [his] career.\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This statement was made to Orioles Vice President [[Jim Duquette]] in a meeting arranged by mutual friend and teammate [[Melvin Mora]]. It was reported that Tejada was claimed by the [[Chicago White Sox]] off trade waivers, but the two teams did not make a deal for Tejada.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n====2006\u20132007====\nTejada played in his 1,000th [[Major League Baseball consecutive games played streaks|consecutive game]] on July 1, 2006.\n\nTejada's streak was at 1,151 games when he was hit on his left wrist by a pitch on June 20, 2007. The next day, he went up to bunt in the top of the first inning, bunted into a force play, and was replaced by a pinch runner. Following that game, it was announced that he had a broken wrist. On June 22 he was placed on the disabled list, ending his streak at 1,152 consecutive games, the fifth longest in Major League history, behind [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] (2,632), [[Lou Gehrig]] (2,130), [[Everett Scott]] (1,307), and [[Steve Garvey]] (1,217).<ref>{{cite news |first=Spencer |last=Fordin |title=Streak over: Tejada placed on DL |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070622&content_id=2042946&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |publisher=[[MLB.com]]|date=June 22, 2007 |accessdate=July 28, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Miguel Tejada 2008.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Tejada playing for the [[2008 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros in 2008]]]]\n\n===Houston Astros (2008\u20132009)===\nOn December 12, 2007, Tejada was dealt to the [[Houston Astros]] for five players, including SP [[Troy Patton]], OF [[Luke Scott]], RP [[Dennis Sarfate]] and RP/SP [[Matt Albers]].<ref>{{cite news|author = |title = Tejada traded to Astros, Orioles to receive five players for former AL MVP|url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/baseball/mlb/12/12/tejada.trade.ap/index.html|work=[[SI.com]]|date = December 12, 2007|accessdate = December 12, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071214160439/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/baseball/mlb/12/12/tejada.trade.ap/index.html |archivedate = December 14, 2007}}</ref>\n\nTejada scored his 1,000th career run on July 7, 2008, at [[PNC Park]].

He played for six different teams, most notably the [[Oakland Athletics]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]], before short stints with the [[Houston Astros]], [[San Diego Padres]], [[San Francisco Giants]], and [[Kansas City Royals]].\n\nTejada spent his first six seasons in MLB with the Athletics, where he began a streak of 1,152 [[Major League Baseball consecutive games played streaks|consecutive game]]s that ended with the Orioles on June 22, 2007. He is a six-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] and a two-time [[Silver Slugger Award]] winner.

''Away Games'' describes the struggles of Dominican players in general and Tejada in particular as they arrive in the U.S. speaking very little English, often in small towns playing for minor league teams, with dreams of making it big.<ref>{{Cite book|title=page for Away Games |isbn = 978-0684849911|last1 = Bret\u00f3n|first1 = Marcos|last2= Villegas|first2= Jos\u00e9 Luis|year=1999 }}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Oakland Athletics (1997\u20132003)===\n\n====1997\u20132001====\nTejada developed quickly into a top-notch prospect, showing early signs of power. He reached the Majors towards the end of the [[1997 Major League Baseball season|1997 season]], joining a struggling Oakland Athletics club. Though he only hit .202 in 26 games that year, the A's saw potential in the 23-year-old Tejada. This was bolstered by his performance with the [[Edmonton Trappers]] (AAA) in the [[Pacific Coast League]] during the season, and returning to the minors to lead the Trappers to a PCL championship that year. He was rewarded with the starting shortstop job beginning in [[1998 Major League Baseball season|1998]].\n\nThe A's, and Tejada, steadily improved over the next two years. His hitting improved as he gained more discipline at the plate. In 1998, he hit .233 with 11 [[home run]]s and in [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999]] his average jumped to .251 with 21 home runs.\n\nAfter a solid 87-win campaign in 1999, Tejada and a core of young players led their A's to their first [[American League Western Division]] title in eight years in [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000]]. Bolstered by an [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|American League MVP]]-winning performance by [[first baseman]] [[Jason Giambi]], and aided by Tejada's .275 average and 30 home runs, the A's won 91 games. The [[2000 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] faced the [[2000 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in the [[2000 American League Division Series|first round of the postseason]], which was won by the Yankees 3-2.\n\nIn [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]], Tejada had a comparable offensive year, hitting .267 with 31 homers. The [[2001 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] captured the American League [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] with a 102-60 record. In the [[2001 American League Division Series|postseason]], however, the A's fell to the [[2001 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in five games, blowing an initial 2-0 series lead.\n\n====2002====\nTejada's breakout year came in [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002]]. With the departure of Jason Giambi to the [[New York Yankees]] during the offseason, and a leg injury to slugger [[Jermaine Dye]], the A's lost two of their key offensive players. Tejada hit .308 with 34 homers and led the [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] to their second Western Division title in three years. Their campaign included an American League record 20 game winning-streak. Tejada contributed one-out, game-winning hits in the 18th and 19th games of that run: a three-run homer off [[Minnesota Twins]] closer [[Eddie Guardado]] for a 7-5 victory and a bases-loaded single against [[2002 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] reliever [[Jason Grimsley]] to break a 6-6 tie. Tejada also showed modest speed on the basepaths with 18 steals over a two-year stretch. His performance was rewarded with the 2002 American League MVP award. For the third straight year, though, the A's fell in the fifth game of the [[2002 American League Division Series|ALDS]], this time to the [[2002 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].\n\n====2003====\nThe [[2003 Major League Baseball season|next year]], both the [[2003 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] and Tejada got off to a slow start, with the shortstop hitting under [[Mendoza line|.200]] for the first month of the season. Improved play in the second half of the season led the A's to their second straight Western Division title and their third in four years. Tejada hit .278 with 27 homers for the year, a decrease from his numbers in 2002, but still leading many offensive categories for shortstops.\n\n[[File:M Tejada - Orioles v Yanks 2007-07-29.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Tejada during his first tenure with the [[2007 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles in 2007]]]]\nIn a [[2003 American League Division Series|tension-filled series]], the powerful offense of the [[2003 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] narrowly edged out the A's in the first round, once again in five games. Tejada was known for his public display of anger toward Boston starting pitcher [[Derek Lowe]] at the series' conclusion for what he perceived as obscene gestures. Lowe denied the accusation, claiming his fist pump was in celebration only.<ref>{{cite web|last=Christensen|first2=Roch|last2=Kubatko|first=Joe|title=Tejada, Lowe say ALDS feud is in past|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-04-07/sports/0404070346_1_mazzilli-tejada-derek-lowe|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=May 18, 2014|date=April 7, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=AL: A's irate about Lowe's gesture|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/10/07/Sports/AL__A_s_irate_about_L.shtml|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=May 18, 2014|date=October 7, 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Baltimore Orioles (2004\u20132007)===\nBy the end of the 2003 season, Tejada had established himself as one of baseball's premier shortstops. The A's elected not to re-sign the free agent, citing budget concerns and a young [[Bobby Crosby]] coming through the system, so Tejada signed a six-year, $72 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles during the offseason.\n\nOn arrival in Baltimore, Tejada was given uniform number 10, since 4, his number in Oakland, had been retired for former manager [[Earl Weaver]]. As an Oriole, Tejada followed in the footsteps of legendary Baltimore shortstop [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]. Like Ripken, Tejada was a strong and durable shortstop with unusual power numbers for a middle infielder.\n\n====2004\u20132005====\nOn July 12, 2004, Tejada won the [[Century 21 Real Estate|Century 21]] [[Home Run Derby]] in [[Houston]]. Tejada hit a (then) record 27 [[home run]]s in the contest, including a record 15 homers in the second round. He defeated [[Houston Astros]] outfielder [[Lance Berkman]] (who would later become his teammate) 5-4 in the final round of the contest.<ref>{{cite web |last=Antonen |first=Mel |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/allstar/2004-07-12-homerun-derby_x.htm |title=Tejada blasts way to victory in Derby |work=USA Today |date=July 12, 2004 |accessdate=April 9, 2016}}</ref> Both records were broken the following year in [[Detroit]] by [[Bobby Abreu]]. Tejada finished the 2004 season with 34 home runs and an MLB-leading 150 RBIs, and won his first career [[Silver Slugger Award]].\n\nWhile Tejada did not participate in the Home Run Derby in 2005, he was an [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] and starter for the [[American League|AL]]. In his first All-Star start, Tejada hit a solo [[home run]] against [[John Smoltz]] of the [[Atlanta Braves]], had a sacrifice RBI and was part of an all-Oriole double play with teammate [[Brian Roberts (baseball)|Brian Roberts]].
