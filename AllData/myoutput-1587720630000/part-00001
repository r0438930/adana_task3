It won the [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]].<ref name=\"AM\" />\n\n==Recording==\n''The Missing Years'' was Prine's first studio release since his 1986 album ''German Afternoons'' and is regarded as his comeback album.  According to the ''Great Days: The John Prine Anthology'' liner notes,  manager Al Bunetta and longtime Prine associate Dan Einstein were brainstorming over prospective producers at Oh Boy headquarters and the name of [[Howie Epstein]] came up.  Epstein, the bass player in [[Tom Petty]]'s Heartbreakers, was a longtime fan, with Prine recalling \"I'd heard for years that he and (Heartbreakers keyboard player) [[Benmont Tench]] would show up at my shows.  And I heard all the guys in the Heartbreakers played my stuff on the road.  So Al called Howie.  And before he could even hang up the phone, Howie was in the office.  Four hours later, he was still there, talking to my manager about my music.\"  [[Roger Waters]] and [[Michael Kamen]] were also very interested in producing Prine's new album.{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=139|2015}} Although it was partially recorded at The Money Pit in [[Nashville]],  it was mostly recorded at Huh Sound Theater in [[Los Angeles]] (actually Epstein's guest bedroom on Laurelcrest Drive),{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=140|2015}} which led to a coterie of famous contributors, including Tom Petty, [[Phil Everly]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Albert Lee]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]].  Prine had bumped into Springsteen at an Italian restaurant the day he arrived to record, with Springsteen telling Prine, \"When you guys get into the record and have something to play, please invite me over.  I'd just love to play guitar or harmonica or sing or whatever.\"{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=144|2015}}  Prine told the ''Phoenix New Times'' in a 1991 interview, \"Howie has one of those houses that looks like it's going to fall off the cliff.  But it was great.  All we paid for was the musicians, the tape and the engineer.  I recorded most of it in a hallway.  I mean a hallway - we're talkin' three-and-a-half feet wide.\"{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=141|2015}}\n\n==Composition==\nAlthough many listeners might assume that the album's title might allude to Prine's recent sabbatical from the music business, it actually refers to the song \"Jesus The Missing Years\", which speculates upon the unrecorded middle 18 years of [[Christ]]'s life.  The surreal piece features, among other things, Jesus traveling to [[France]] and [[Spain]], marrying an [[Irish people|Irish]] bride, inventing [[Santa Claus]], and opening a show for country singer [[George Jones]].  \"All The Best\" dealt with the theme of [[divorce]], with the singer commenting before a performance of the song on Irish TV in 1990, \"Country songs and country songwriters are a strange lot.  Seems like some of the best country songs over the years have come from some of the sadder situations in life - like divorce.  Having recently acquired my second divorce, about a month later the song truck pulled up and dumped a bunch of great songs on my lawn.\"\n\nIn the ''Great Days'' anthology, Prine recalls that \"The Sins Of Memphisto\" was written under pressure from producer Epstein:  \"We were 12 cuts into ''The Missing Years'', and Howie says, 'We need one or two more cuts.'  And I went, 'You're kidding.  From where?  We've been working for nine months.  I don't have anything hiding on the shelf.  You could take a autopsy, and you won't find a song inside of me.' So I went and locked myself in a hotel room and went, 'If he wants a song, he'll get a song.'  I tried to write one from as far in left field as I could and came up with 'Memphisto'.\"  Prine biographer Eddie Huffman calls the song \"a casually visionary song about loss of innocence, relationships, sex, aging, and the passage of time, one of the most remarkable in Prine's catalog, effortlessly tying together various lyrical threads from throughout his career as a songwriter.\"{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=142|2015}}\n\n''The Missing Years'' also features \"Take A Look At My Heart\" (co-written with rocker [[John Mellencamp]]) and collaborations with Keith Sykes and British songwriter [[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Roger Cook]].  Prine covers the [[Lefty Frizzell]] classic \"I Want To Be With You Always,\" while \"Daddy's Little Pumpkin\" was partly inspired by [[Mississippi John Hurt]], who [[Pat McLaughlin]] reintroduced Prine to at the time.{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=142|2015}}  The album opener \"Picture Show\" (which features Tom Petty on background vocals) reflects Prine's lifelong love of movies and namechecks [[John Garfield]], [[James Dean]], and [[Montgomery Clift]], while \"It's a Big Old Goofy World\" was inspired by his mother Verna's love of crossword puzzles.{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=144-145|2015}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 =[[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}} <ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web |first=William |last=Ruhlman |title= ''The Missing Years'' > Review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id= r15828 |pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>\n| rev2 =[[Robert Christgau]]\n| rev2Score = (A-) <ref name=\"RC\">{{cite web |first= Robert |last= Christgau|title= ''The Missing Years'' > Review |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=John+Prine |publisher=[[Robert Christgau]] |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|4|4}} <ref name=\"CT\">{{cite journal |last=Van Matre |first=Lynn |title=Review: ''The Missing Years'' |journal=[[Chicago Tribune]] |issue= |date=October 1991 |url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-10-31/features/9104070905_1_missing-years-all-star-john-prine |page=}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev4Score = (A-)<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite journal |last=Nash |first=Alanna |title=Review: ''The Missing Years'' |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |issue= |date=November 1991 |url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316253,00.html |page=}}</ref>\n|rev5 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n|rev5Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin|title=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|year=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|edition=4th|isbn=978-0195313734|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref>\n}}\n''The Missing Years'' was well received by critics and won the [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]].
