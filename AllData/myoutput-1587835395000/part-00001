This stems largely from [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s proximity to the [[Sun]] which makes reaching it with spacecraft technically challenging and Earth-based observations difficult.\n\nMercury's surface is dominated by [[impact craters]], basaltic rock and smooth plains, many of them a result of [[Flood basalt|flood volcanism]], similar in some respects to the [[lunar maria]],<ref name=nasa_mercury/><ref name=discoverynews_20111005/> and locally by pyroclastic deposits.<ref name=\"becca\">{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Rebecca J.|last2=Rothery|first2=David A.|last3=Conway|first3=Susan J.|last4=Anand|first4=Mahesh|title=Long-lived explosive volcanism on Mercury|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=16 September 2014|volume=41|issue=17|pages=6084\u20136092|doi=10.1002/2014GL061224|bibcode = 2014GeoRL..41.6084T |doi-access=free}}</ref> Other notable features include [[Volcanic cone|vents]] which appear to be the source of magma-carved valleys, often-grouped irregular-shaped depressions termed \"hollows\" that are believed to be the result of collapsed magma chambers,<ref name=jhuapl_20110929/> [[Fault scarp|scarps]] indicative of thrust faulting and mineral deposits (possibly ice) inside craters at the poles. Long thought to be geologically inactive, new evidence suggests there may still be some level of activity.<ref name=messenger_GRS_evolution/><ref name=jhuapl349/>\n\nMercury's density implies a solid iron-rich core that accounts for about 60% of its volume (75% of its radius).<ref name=messenger_key2evolution/> Mercury's magnetic equator is shifted nearly 20% of the planet's radius towards the north, the largest ratio of all planets.<ref name=messenger_offsetfield/> This shift suggests there being one or more iron-rich molten layers surrounding the core producing a dynamo effect similar to that of Earth. Additionally, the offset magnetic [[dipole]] may result in uneven surface weathering by the [[solar wind]], knocking more surface particles up into the southern [[Atmosphere of Mercury|exosphere]] and transporting them for deposit in the north. Scientists are gathering [[telemetry]] to determine if such is the case.<ref name=messenger_offsetfield/>\n\nAfter having completed the first [[Solar time|solar day]] of its mission in September 2011, more than 99% of Mercury's surface had been mapped by [[NASA]]'s ''[[MESSENGER]]'' probe in both color and monochrome with such detail that scientists' understanding of Mercury's geology has significantly surpassed the level achieved following the ''[[Mariner 10]]'' flybys of the 1970s.<ref name=jhuapl_20110929 />\n\n.....\n\n==Difficulties in exploration==\n[[File:Mariner 10.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|''Mariner 10'' probe]]\nReaching Mercury from Earth poses significant technical challenges, because the planet orbits so much closer to the Sun than does the Earth. A Mercury-bound [[spacecraft]] launched from Earth must travel 91 million kilometers into the Sun's [[gravity|gravitational]] [[potential well]]. Starting from the Earth's [[orbital speed]] of 30&nbsp;km/s, the change in [[velocity]] ([[delta-v]]) the spacecraft must make to enter into a [[Hohmann transfer orbit]] that passes near Mercury is large compared to other planetary missions. The [[potential energy]] liberated by moving down the Sun's potential well becomes [[kinetic energy]]; requiring another large delta-''v'' to do anything other than rapidly pass by Mercury. In order to land safely or enter a stable orbit the spacecraft must rely entirely on rocket motors because Mercury has negligible atmosphere. A direct trip to Mercury actually requires more rocket fuel than that required to [[escape velocity|escape]] the Solar System completely. As a result, only two space probes, ''[[Mariner 10]]'' and ''[[MESSENGER]]'', both by [[NASA]], have visited Mercury so far.\n[[File:Mercury's internal structure1.jpg|alt=|thumb|200x200px|{{bulleted list|Crust \u2013 100\u2013200&nbsp;km thick|Mantle \u2013 600&nbsp;km thick|Core \u2013 1,800&nbsp;km radius}}]]\nFurthermore, the space environment near Mercury is demanding, posing the double dangers to spacecraft of intense [[solar radiation]] and high temperatures.\n\nHistorically, a second obstacle has been that Mercury's [[Rotation period|period of rotation]] is a slow 58 [[Earth]] days, so that spacecraft flybys are restricted to viewing only a single illuminated hemisphere. In fact, unfortunately, even though [[Mariner 10]] space probe flew past Mercury three times during 1974 and 1975, it observed the same area during each pass. This was because Mariner 10's orbital period was almost exactly 3 sidereal Mercury days, and the same face of the planet was lit at each of the close approaches. As a result, less than 45% of the planet's surface was mapped.\n\nEarth-based observations are made difficult by Mercury's constant proximity to the Sun. This has several consequences:\n#Whenever the sky is dark enough for viewing through telescopes, Mercury is always already near the horizon, where viewing conditions are poor anyway due to atmospheric factors.\n#The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and other space observatories are usually prevented from pointing close to the Sun for safety reasons (Erroneously pointing such sensitive instruments at the Sun is likely to cause permanent damage).\n\n==Mercury's geological history==\n[[File:Gravity Anomalies on Mercury.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mercury \u2013 Gravity Anomalies \u2013 mass concentrations (red) suggest subsurface structure and evolution.]]\nLike the Earth, Moon and [[Mars]], Mercury's geologic history is divided up into [[Era (geology)|eras]].  From oldest to youngest, these are: the [[pre-Tolstojan]], [[Tolstojan]], [[Calorian]], [[Mansurian (geology)|Mansurian]], and [[Kuiperian]].  These ages are based on [[relative dating]] only.<ref name=Spudis01/>\n\nAfter the formation of Mercury along with the rest of the [[Solar System]] 4.6 billion years ago, heavy bombardment by asteroids and comets ensued. The last intense bombardment phase, the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] came to an end about 3.8 billion years ago. Some regions or [[massif]]s, a prominent one being the one that formed the [[Caloris Basin]], were filled by magma eruptions from within the planet. These created smooth intercrater plains similar to the [[Lunar mare|maria]] found on the [[Moon]].\nLater, as the planet cooled and contracted, its surface began to crack and form ridges; these surface cracks and ridges can be seen on top of other features, such as the craters and smoother plains\u2014a clear indication that they are more recent.\nMercury's period of [[volcanism]] ended when the planet's mantle had contracted enough to prevent further [[lava]] from breaking through to the surface. This probably occurred at some point during its first 700 or 800 million years of history.\n\nSince then, the main surface processes have been intermittent impacts.\n\n===Timeline===\n<timeline>\nImageSize  = width:780 height:100\nPlotArea   = left:10 right:10 bottom:20 top:0\nAlignBars  = early\n\nPeriod      = from:-4500 till:0\nTimeAxis    = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor  = unit:year increment:500 start:-4500\nScaleMinor  = unit:year increment:100 start:-4500\n\nLineData=\n at:-3875 frompos:46 tillpos:55 width:0.5 color:black\n at:-3825 frompos:13 tillpos:20 width:0.5 color:black\nPlotData=\n align:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 mark:(line,black) width:25 shift:(0,-5)\n\n text:Mansurian/Kuiperian from:-3000 till:0 color:limegreen \n text:Late_Calorian from:-3800 till:-3000 color:yellowgreen\n text:Calorian from:-3850 till:-3800 shift:(5,-30) color:teal\n text:Tolstojan from:-3900 till:-3850 shift:(0,25) color:brightgreen\n text:pre-Tolstojan from:start till:-3900 color:green\n</timeline>\nTime unit: millions of years\n\n==Surface features==\nMercury's surface is overall similar in appearance to that of the Moon, with extensive [[Lunar mare|mare]]-like plains and heavily cratered [[terrain]]s similar to the [[Geology of the Moon|lunar highlands]] and made locally by accumulations of pyroclastic deposits.<ref name=\"becca\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; width:600px;\"\n!

They appear in all states of degradation, from relatively fresh rayed-craters, to highly degraded crater remnants. Mercurian craters differ subtly from Lunar craters \u2013 the extent of their ejecta blankets is much smaller, which is a consequence of the 2.5 times stronger surface gravity on Mercury.<ref name=Spudis01 />\n[[File:Unmasking the Secrets of Mercury.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[MESSENGER#Scientific instruments|MASCS]] spectrum scan of Mercury's surface by ''[[MESSENGER]]'']]\n[[File:Mercury's 'Weird Terrain'.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The so-called \"Weird Terrain\" formed by the [[Caloris Basin]] impact at its antipodal point]]\nThe largest known crater is the enormous Caloris Basin, with a diameter of 1550&nbsp;km,<ref name=\"newscientist30012008\" /> A basin of comparable size, tentatively named [[Skinakas Basin]] had been postulated from low resolution Earth-based observations of the non-Mariner-imaged hemisphere, but has not been observed in ''MESSENGER'' imagery of the corresponding terrain. The impact which created the Caloris Basin was so powerful that its effects are seen on a global scale. It caused [[lava]] eruptions and left a concentric ring over 2&nbsp;km tall surrounding the [[impact crater]]. At the [[Antipodes|antipode]] of the Caloris Basin lies a large region of unusual, hilly and furrowed terrain, sometimes called \"Weird Terrain\". The favoured hypothesis for the origin of this geomorphologic unit is that shock waves generated during the impact traveled around the planet, and when they converged at the basin's antipode (180 degrees away) the high stresses were capable of fracturing the surface.<ref name=schultz_gault /> A much less favoured idea was that this terrain formed as a result of the convergence of ejecta at this basin's antipode. Furthermore, the formation of the Caloris Basin appears to have produced a shallow depression concentric around the basin, which was later filled by the smooth plains (see below).\n\nOverall about 15 impact basins have been identified on the imaged part of Mercury. Other notable basins include the 400&nbsp;km wide, multi-ring, [[Tolstoj Basin]] which has an ejecta blanket extending up to 500&nbsp;km from its rim, and its floor has been filled by smooth plains materials. [[Beethoven Basin]] also has a similar-sized ejecta blanket and a 625&nbsp;km diameter rim.<ref name=Spudis01/>\n\nAs on the [[Moon]], fresh craters on Mercury show prominent bright [[ray system]]s. These are made by ejected debris, which tend to be brighter while they remain relatively fresh because of a lesser amount of [[space weathering]] than the surrounding older terrain.\n\n====Pit-floor craters====\nSome impact craters on Mercury have non-circular, irregularly shaped depressions or pits on their floors. Such craters have been termed pit-floor craters, and ''[[MESSENGER]]'' team members have suggested that such pits formed by the collapse of subsurface [[magma chamber]]s. If this suggestion is correct, the pits are evidence of [[volcanic]] processes at work on Mercury.<ref name=jhuapl349 /> Pit craters are rimless, often irregularly shaped, and steep-sided, and they display no associated [[ejecta]] or [[lava flow]]s but are typically distinctive in color. For example, the pits of [[Praxiteles (crater)|Praxiteles]] have an orange hue.<ref name=jhuapl308/> Thought to be evidence of shallow magmatic activity, pit craters may have formed when subsurface magma drained elsewhere and left a roof area unsupported, leading to collapse and the formation of the pit.  Major craters exhibiting these features include [[Beckett (crater)|Beckett]], [[Gibran (crater)|Gibran]] and [[Lermontov (crater)|Lermontov]], among others.<ref name=jhuapl335/> It was suggested that these pits with associated brighter and redder deposits may be pyroclastic deposits caused by explosive volcanism.<ref name=\"becca\"/>\n[[File:PIA19423-Mercury-AbedinCrater-20150416.jpg|thumb|600px|center|<center>Interior of Abedin crater</center>]]\n\n===Plains===\nThere are two geologically distinct plains units on Mercury:<ref name=Spudis01/><ref name=WagWolIva01 />\n* ''[[Intercrater plains on Mercury|Inter-crater plains]]'' are the oldest visible surface,<ref name=Spudis01/> predating the heavily cratered terrain. They are gently rolling or hilly and occur in the regions between larger craters. The inter-crater plains appear to have obliterated many earlier craters, and show a general paucity of smaller craters below about 30&nbsp;km in diameter.<ref name=WagWolIva01/> It is not clear whether they are of volcanic or impact origin.<ref name=WagWolIva01/> The inter-crater plains are distributed roughly uniformly over the entire surface of the planet.\n* ''Smooth plains'' are widespread flat areas resembling the lunar maria, which fill depressions of various sizes. Notably, they fill a wide ring surrounding the Caloris Basin. An appreciable difference to the lunar maria is that the smooth plains of Mercury have the same albedo as the older intercrater plains. Despite a lack of unequivocally volcanic features, their localisation and lobate-shaped colour units strongly support a volcanic origin. All the Mercurian smooth plains formed significantly later than the Caloris basin, as evidenced by appreciably smaller crater densities than on the Caloris ejecta blanket.<ref name=Spudis01/>\nThe floor of the [[Caloris Basin]] is also filled by a geologically distinct flat plain, broken up by ridges and fractures in a roughly polygonal pattern. It is not clear whether they are volcanic lavas induced by the impact, or a large sheet of [[impact melt]].<ref name=Spudis01/>\n\n===Tectonic features===\n[[File:Discovery Rupes.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Discovery Rupes]].]]\nOne unusual feature of the planet's surface is the numerous compression folds which crisscross the plains. It is thought that as the planet's interior cooled, it contracted and its surface began to deform. The folds can be seen on top of other features, such as craters and smoother plains, indicating that they are more recent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dzurisin |first1=D. |title=The tectonic and volcanic history of mercury as inferred from studies of scarps, ridges, troughs, and other lineaments |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth |date=1978 |volume=83 |issue=B10 |pages=4883\u20134906 |doi=10.1029/JB083iB10p04883}}</ref> Mercury's surface is also flexed by significant [[tidal bulge]]s raised by the [[Sun]]\u2014the Sun's tides on Mercury are about 17% stronger than the Moon's on Earth.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Van Hoolst |first1=T. |title=Mercury's tides and interior structure |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets |date=2003 |volume=108 |issue=E11 |doi=10.1029/2003JE002126|last2=Jacobs|first2=C.|page=5121}}</ref>\n\n===Terminology===\nNon-crater surface features are given the following names:\n* [[Albedo]] features \u2013 areas of markedly different reflectivity\n* [[Dorsum (astrogeology)|Dorsa]] \u2014 [[ridge]]s (''see [[List of ridges on Mercury]]'')\n* Montes \u2014 [[mountain]]s (''see [[List of geological features on Mercury#Mountains|List of mountains on Mercury]]'')\n* [[Planitia]]e \u2014 [[plain]]s (''see [[List of plains on Mercury]]'')\n* [[Rupes]] \u2014 [[escarpment|scarps]] (''see [[List of scarps on Mercury]]'')\n* [[Vallis (planetary geology)|Valles]] \u2014 [[valley]]s (''see [[List of valleys on Mercury]]'')\n{{Clear}}\n\n==High-albedo polar patches and possible presence of ice==\nThe first radar observations of Mercury were carried out by the [[radiotelescope]]s at [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]] ([[Puerto Rico]]) and [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] ([[California]], United States), with assistance from the U.S. [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] [[Very Large Array]] (VLA) facility in [[New Mexico]]. The transmissions sent from the NASA [[Deep Space Network]] site at Goldstone were at a power level of 460&nbsp;kW at 8.51&nbsp;GHz; the signals received by the VLA multi-dish array detected points of radar reflectivity (radar luminosity) with depolarized waves from Mercury's north pole.\n\n[[File:Merc fig2sm.jpg|thumb|Radar image of Mercury's north pole.]]\nRadar maps of the surface of the planet were made using the Arecibo radiotelescope. The survey was conducted with 420&nbsp;kW [[Ultra high frequency|UHF band]] (2.4&nbsp;GHz) radio waves which allowed for a 15&nbsp;km resolution. This study not only confirmed the existence of the zones of high reflectivity and depolarization, but also found a number of new areas (bringing the total to 20) and was even able to survey the poles. It has been postulated that surface [[ice]] may be responsible for these high luminosity levels, as the silicate rocks that compose most of the surface of Mercury have exactly the opposite effect on luminosity.\n\nIn spite of its proximity to the Sun, Mercury may have surface ice, since temperatures near the poles are constantly below freezing point: On the polar plains, the temperature does not rise above \u2212106&nbsp;\u00b0C. And [[Impact crater|crater]]s at Mercury's higher latitudes (discovered by radar surveys from Earth as well) may be deep enough to shield the ice from direct sunlight. Inside the craters, where there is no solar light, temperatures fall to \u2212171&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=nssdc_ice/>\n\nDespite [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] into the vacuum of space, the temperature in the permanently shadowed region is so low that this sublimation is slow enough to potentially preserve deposited ice for billions of years.\n\nAt the South Pole, the location of a large zone of high reflectivity coincides with the location of the [[Chao Meng-Fu (crater)|Chao Meng-Fu crater]], and other small craters containing reflective areas have also been identified. At the North Pole, a number of craters smaller than Chao-Meng Fu have these reflective properties.\n\nThe strength of the radar reflections seen on Mercury are small compared to that which would occur with pure ice. This may be due to powder deposition that does not cover the surface of the crater completely or other causes, e.g. a thin overlying surface layer. However, the evidence for ice on Mercury is not definitive. The anomalous reflective properties could also be due to the existence of deposits of [[metal]]lic [[sulfates]] or other materials with high reflectance.\n\n===Possible origin of ice===\nMercury is not unique in having craters that stand in permanent shadow; at the south pole of Earth's [[Moon]] there is a large crater ([[Aitken (crater)|Aitken]]) where some [[lunar ice|possible signs of the presence of ice]] have been seen (although their interpretation is disputed). It is thought by astronomers that ice on both Mercury and the Moon must have originated from external sources, mostly impacting [[comet]]s. These are known to contain large amounts, or a majority, of ice. It is therefore conceivable for meteorite impacts to have deposited water in the permanently shadow craters, where it would remain unwarmed for possibly billions of years due to the lack of an atmosphere to efficiently conduct heat and stable orientation of Mercury's [[axial tilt|rotation axis]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; width:500px;\"\n!

This stems largely from [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s proximity to the [[Sun]] which makes reaching it with spacecraft technically challenging and Earth-based observations difficult.\n\nMercury's surface is dominated by [[impact craters]], basaltic rock and smooth plains, many of them a result of [[Flood basalt|flood volcanism]], similar in some respects to the [[lunar maria]],<ref name=nasa_mercury/><ref name=discoverynews_20111005/> and locally by pyroclastic deposits.<ref name=\"becca\">{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Rebecca J.|last2=Rothery|first2=David A.|last3=Conway|first3=Susan J.|last4=Anand|first4=Mahesh|title=Long-lived explosive volcanism on Mercury|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=16 September 2014|volume=41|issue=17|pages=6084\u20136092|doi=10.1002/2014GL061224|bibcode = 2014GeoRL..41.6084T |doi-access=free}}</ref> Other notable features include [[Volcanic cone|vents]] which appear to be the source of magma-carved valleys, often-grouped irregular-shaped depressions termed \"hollows\" that are believed to be the result of collapsed magma chambers,<ref name=jhuapl_20110929/> [[Fault scarp|scarps]] indicative of thrust faulting and mineral deposits (possibly ice) inside craters at the poles. Long thought to be geologically inactive, new evidence suggests there may still be some level of activity.<ref name=messenger_GRS_evolution/><ref name=jhuapl349/>\n\nMercury's density implies a solid iron-rich core that accounts for about 60% of its volume (75% of its radius).<ref name=messenger_key2evolution/> Mercury's magnetic equator is shifted nearly 20% of the planet's radius towards the north, the largest ratio of all planets.<ref name=messenger_offsetfield/> This shift suggests there being one or more iron-rich molten layers surrounding the core producing a dynamo effect similar to that of Earth. Additionally, the offset magnetic [[dipole]] may result in uneven surface weathering by the [[solar wind]], knocking more surface particles up into the southern [[Atmosphere of Mercury|exosphere]] and transporting them for deposit in the north. Scientists are gathering [[telemetry]] to determine if such is the case.<ref name=messenger_offsetfield/>\n\nAfter having completed the first [[Solar time|solar day]] of its mission in September 2011, more than 99% of Mercury's surface had been mapped by [[NASA]]'s ''[[MESSENGER]]'' probe in both color and monochrome with such detail that scientists' understanding of Mercury's geology has significantly surpassed the level achieved following the ''[[Mariner 10]]'' flybys of the 1970s.<ref name=jhuapl_20110929 />\n\n==Difficulties in exploration==\n[[File:Mariner 10.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|''Mariner 10'' probe]]\nReaching Mercury from Earth poses significant technical challenges, because the planet orbits so much closer to the Sun than does the Earth. A Mercury-bound [[spacecraft]] launched from Earth must travel 91 million kilometers into the Sun's [[gravity|gravitational]] [[potential well]]. Starting from the Earth's [[orbital speed]] of 30&nbsp;km/s, the change in [[velocity]] ([[delta-v]]) the spacecraft must make to enter into a [[Hohmann transfer orbit]] that passes near Mercury is large compared to other planetary missions. The [[potential energy]] liberated by moving down the Sun's potential well becomes [[kinetic energy]]; requiring another large delta-''v'' to do anything other than rapidly pass by Mercury. In order to land safely or enter a stable orbit the spacecraft must rely entirely on rocket motors because Mercury has negligible atmosphere. A direct trip to Mercury actually requires more rocket fuel than that required to [[escape velocity|escape]] the Solar System completely. As a result, only two space probes, ''[[Mariner 10]]'' and ''[[MESSENGER]]'', both by [[NASA]], have visited Mercury so far.\n[[File:Mercury's internal structure1.jpg|alt=|thumb|200x200px|{{bulleted list|Crust \u2013 100\u2013200&nbsp;km thick|Mantle \u2013 600&nbsp;km thick|Core \u2013 1,800&nbsp;km radius}}]]\nFurthermore, the space environment near Mercury is demanding, posing the double dangers to spacecraft of intense [[solar radiation]] and high temperatures.\n\nHistorically, a second obstacle has been that Mercury's [[Rotation period|period of rotation]] is a slow 58 [[Earth]] days, so that spacecraft flybys are restricted to viewing only a single illuminated hemisphere. In fact, unfortunately, even though [[Mariner 10]] space probe flew past Mercury three times during 1974 and 1975, it observed the same area during each pass. This was because Mariner 10's orbital period was almost exactly 3 sidereal Mercury days, and the same face of the planet was lit at each of the close approaches. As a result, less than 45% of the planet's surface was mapped.\n\nEarth-based observations are made difficult by Mercury's constant proximity to the Sun. This has several consequences:\n#Whenever the sky is dark enough for viewing through telescopes, Mercury is always already near the horizon, where viewing conditions are poor anyway due to atmospheric factors.\n#The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and other space observatories are usually prevented from pointing close to the Sun for safety reasons (Erroneously pointing such sensitive instruments at the Sun is likely to cause permanent damage).\n\n==Mercury's geological history==\n[[File:Gravity Anomalies on Mercury.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mercury \u2013 Gravity Anomalies \u2013 mass concentrations (red) suggest subsurface structure and evolution.]]\nLike the Earth, Moon and [[Mars]], Mercury's geologic history is divided up into [[Era (geology)|eras]].  From oldest to youngest, these are: the [[pre-Tolstojan]], [[Tolstojan]], [[Calorian]], [[Mansurian (geology)|Mansurian]], and [[Kuiperian]].  These ages are based on [[relative dating]] only.<ref name=Spudis01/>\n\nAfter the formation of Mercury along with the rest of the [[Solar System]] 4.6 billion years ago, heavy bombardment by asteroids and comets ensued. The last intense bombardment phase, the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] came to an end about 3.8 billion years ago. Some regions or [[massif]]s, a prominent one being the one that formed the [[Caloris Basin]], were filled by magma eruptions from within the planet. These created smooth intercrater plains similar to the [[Lunar mare|maria]] found on the [[Moon]].\nLater, as the planet cooled and contracted, its surface began to crack and form ridges; these surface cracks and ridges can be seen on top of other features, such as the craters and smoother plains\u2014a clear indication that they are more recent.\nMercury's period of [[volcanism]] ended when the planet's mantle had contracted enough to prevent further [[lava]] from breaking through to the surface. This probably occurred at some point during its first 700 or 800 million years of history.\n\nSince then, the main surface processes have been intermittent impacts.\n\n===Timeline===\n<timeline>\nImageSize  = width:780 height:100\nPlotArea   = left:10 right:10 bottom:20 top:0\nAlignBars  = early\n\nPeriod      = from:-4500 till:0\nTimeAxis    = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor  = unit:year increment:500 start:-4500\nScaleMinor  = unit:year increment:100 start:-4500\n\nLineData=\n at:-3875 frompos:46 tillpos:55 width:0.5 color:black\n at:-3825 frompos:13 tillpos:20 width:0.5 color:black\nPlotData=\n align:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 mark:(line,black) width:25 shift:(0,-5)\n\n text:Mansurian/Kuiperian from:-3000 till:0 color:limegreen \n text:Late_Calorian from:-3800 till:-3000 color:yellowgreen\n text:Calorian from:-3850 till:-3800 shift:(5,-30) color:teal\n text:Tolstojan from:-3900 till:-3850 shift:(0,25) color:brightgreen\n text:pre-Tolstojan from:start till:-3900 color:green\n</timeline>\nTime unit: millions of years\n\n==Surface features==\nMercury's surface is overall similar in appearance to that of the Moon, with extensive [[Lunar mare|mare]]-like plains and heavily cratered [[terrain]]s similar to the [[Geology of the Moon|lunar highlands]] and made locally by accumulations of pyroclastic deposits.<ref name=\"becca\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; width:600px;\"\n!

They appear in all states of degradation, from relatively fresh rayed-craters, to highly degraded crater remnants. Mercurian craters differ subtly from Lunar craters \u2013 the extent of their ejecta blankets is much smaller, which is a consequence of the 2.5 times stronger surface gravity on Mercury.<ref name=Spudis01 />\n[[File:Unmasking the Secrets of Mercury.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[MESSENGER#Scientific instruments|MASCS]] spectrum scan of Mercury's surface by ''[[MESSENGER]]'']]\n[[File:Mercury's 'Weird Terrain'.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The so-called \"Weird Terrain\" formed by the [[Caloris Basin]] impact at its antipodal point]]\nThe largest known crater is the enormous Caloris Basin, with a diameter of 1550&nbsp;km,<ref name=\"newscientist30012008\" /> A basin of comparable size, tentatively named [[Skinakas Basin]] had been postulated from low resolution Earth-based observations of the non-Mariner-imaged hemisphere, but has not been observed in ''MESSENGER'' imagery of the corresponding terrain. The impact which created the Caloris Basin was so powerful that its effects are seen on a global scale. It caused [[lava]] eruptions and left a concentric ring over 2&nbsp;km tall surrounding the [[impact crater]]. At the [[Antipodes|antipode]] of the Caloris Basin lies a large region of unusual, hilly and furrowed terrain, sometimes called \"Weird Terrain\". The favoured hypothesis for the origin of this geomorphologic unit is that shock waves generated during the impact traveled around the planet, and when they converged at the basin's antipode (180 degrees away) the high stresses were capable of fracturing the surface.<ref name=schultz_gault /> A much less favoured idea was that this terrain formed as a result of the convergence of ejecta at this basin's antipode. Furthermore, the formation of the Caloris Basin appears to have produced a shallow depression concentric around the basin, which was later filled by the smooth plains (see below).\n\nOverall about 15 impact basins have been identified on the imaged part of Mercury. Other notable basins include the 400&nbsp;km wide, multi-ring, [[Tolstoj Basin]] which has an ejecta blanket extending up to 500&nbsp;km from its rim, and its floor has been filled by smooth plains materials. [[Beethoven Basin]] also has a similar-sized ejecta blanket and a 625&nbsp;km diameter rim.<ref name=Spudis01/>\n\nAs on the [[Moon]], fresh craters on Mercury show prominent bright [[ray system]]s. These are made by ejected debris, which tend to be brighter while they remain relatively fresh because of a lesser amount of [[space weathering]] than the surrounding older terrain.\n\n====Pit-floor craters====\nSome impact craters on Mercury have non-circular, irregularly shaped depressions or pits on their floors. Such craters have been termed pit-floor craters, and ''[[MESSENGER]]'' team members have suggested that such pits formed by the collapse of subsurface [[magma chamber]]s. If this suggestion is correct, the pits are evidence of [[volcanic]] processes at work on Mercury.<ref name=jhuapl349 /> Pit craters are rimless, often irregularly shaped, and steep-sided, and they display no associated [[ejecta]] or [[lava flow]]s but are typically distinctive in color. For example, the pits of [[Praxiteles (crater)|Praxiteles]] have an orange hue.<ref name=jhuapl308/> Thought to be evidence of shallow magmatic activity, pit craters may have formed when subsurface magma drained elsewhere and left a roof area unsupported, leading to collapse and the formation of the pit.  Major craters exhibiting these features include [[Beckett (crater)|Beckett]], [[Gibran (crater)|Gibran]] and [[Lermontov (crater)|Lermontov]], among others.<ref name=jhuapl335/> It was suggested that these pits with associated brighter and redder deposits may be pyroclastic deposits caused by explosive volcanism.<ref name=\"becca\"/>\n[[File:PIA19423-Mercury-AbedinCrater-20150416.jpg|thumb|600px|center|<center>Interior of Abedin crater</center>]]\n\n===Plains===\nThere are two geologically distinct plains units on Mercury:<ref name=Spudis01/><ref name=WagWolIva01 />\n* ''[[Intercrater plains on Mercury|Inter-crater plains]]'' are the oldest visible surface,<ref name=Spudis01/> predating the heavily cratered terrain. They are gently rolling or hilly and occur in the regions between larger craters. The inter-crater plains appear to have obliterated many earlier craters, and show a general paucity of smaller craters below about 30&nbsp;km in diameter.<ref name=WagWolIva01/> It is not clear whether they are of volcanic or impact origin.<ref name=WagWolIva01/> The inter-crater plains are distributed roughly uniformly over the entire surface of the planet.\n* ''Smooth plains'' are widespread flat areas resembling the lunar maria, which fill depressions of various sizes. Notably, they fill a wide ring surrounding the Caloris Basin. An appreciable difference to the lunar maria is that the smooth plains of Mercury have the same albedo as the older intercrater plains. Despite a lack of unequivocally volcanic features, their localisation and lobate-shaped colour units strongly support a volcanic origin. All the Mercurian smooth plains formed significantly later than the Caloris basin, as evidenced by appreciably smaller crater densities than on the Caloris ejecta blanket.<ref name=Spudis01/>\nThe floor of the [[Caloris Basin]] is also filled by a geologically distinct flat plain, broken up by ridges and fractures in a roughly polygonal pattern. It is not clear whether they are volcanic lavas induced by the impact, or a large sheet of [[impact melt]].<ref name=Spudis01/>\n\n===Tectonic features===\n[[File:Discovery Rupes.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Discovery Rupes]].]]\nOne unusual feature of the planet's surface is the numerous compression folds which crisscross the plains. It is thought that as the planet's interior cooled, it contracted and its surface began to deform. The folds can be seen on top of other features, such as craters and smoother plains, indicating that they are more recent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dzurisin |first1=D. |title=The tectonic and volcanic history of mercury as inferred from studies of scarps, ridges, troughs, and other lineaments |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth |date=1978 |volume=83 |issue=B10 |pages=4883\u20134906 |doi=10.1029/JB083iB10p04883}}</ref> Mercury's surface is also flexed by significant [[tidal bulge]]s raised by the [[Sun]]\u2014the Sun's tides on Mercury are about 17% stronger than the Moon's on Earth.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Van Hoolst |first1=T. |title=Mercury's tides and interior structure |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets |date=2003 |volume=108 |issue=E11 |doi=10.1029/2003JE002126|last2=Jacobs|first2=C.|page=5121}}</ref>\n\n===Terminology===\nNon-crater surface features are given the following names:\n* [[Albedo]] features \u2013 areas of markedly different reflectivity\n* [[Dorsum (astrogeology)|Dorsa]] \u2014 [[ridge]]s (''see [[List of ridges on Mercury]]'')\n* Montes \u2014 [[mountain]]s (''see [[List of geological features on Mercury#Mountains|List of mountains on Mercury]]'')\n* [[Planitia]]e \u2014 [[plain]]s (''see [[List of plains on Mercury]]'')\n* [[Rupes]] \u2014 [[escarpment|scarps]] (''see [[List of scarps on Mercury]]'')\n* [[Vallis (planetary geology)|Valles]] \u2014 [[valley]]s (''see [[List of valleys on Mercury]]'')\n{{Clear}}\n\n==High-albedo polar patches and possible presence of ice==\nThe first radar observations of Mercury were carried out by the [[radiotelescope]]s at [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]] ([[Puerto Rico]]) and [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] ([[California]], United States), with assistance from the U.S. [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] [[Very Large Array]] (VLA) facility in [[New Mexico]]. The transmissions sent from the NASA [[Deep Space Network]] site at Goldstone were at a power level of 460&nbsp;kW at 8.51&nbsp;GHz; the signals received by the VLA multi-dish array detected points of radar reflectivity (radar luminosity) with depolarized waves from Mercury's north pole.\n\n[[File:Merc fig2sm.jpg|thumb|Radar image of Mercury's north pole.]]\nRadar maps of the surface of the planet were made using the Arecibo radiotelescope. The survey was conducted with 420&nbsp;kW [[Ultra high frequency|UHF band]] (2.4&nbsp;GHz) radio waves which allowed for a 15&nbsp;km resolution. This study not only confirmed the existence of the zones of high reflectivity and depolarization, but also found a number of new areas (bringing the total to 20) and was even able to survey the poles. It has been postulated that surface [[ice]] may be responsible for these high luminosity levels, as the silicate rocks that compose most of the surface of Mercury have exactly the opposite effect on luminosity.\n\nIn spite of its proximity to the Sun, Mercury may have surface ice, since temperatures near the poles are constantly below freezing point: On the polar plains, the temperature does not rise above \u2212106&nbsp;\u00b0C. And [[Impact crater|crater]]s at Mercury's higher latitudes (discovered by radar surveys from Earth as well) may be deep enough to shield the ice from direct sunlight. Inside the craters, where there is no solar light, temperatures fall to \u2212171&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=nssdc_ice/>\n\nDespite [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] into the vacuum of space, the temperature in the permanently shadowed region is so low that this sublimation is slow enough to potentially preserve deposited ice for billions of years.\n\nAt the South Pole, the location of a large zone of high reflectivity coincides with the location of the [[Chao Meng-Fu (crater)|Chao Meng-Fu crater]], and other small craters containing reflective areas have also been identified. At the North Pole, a number of craters smaller than Chao-Meng Fu have these reflective properties.\n\nThe strength of the radar reflections seen on Mercury are small compared to that which would occur with pure ice. This may be due to powder deposition that does not cover the surface of the crater completely or other causes, e.g. a thin overlying surface layer. However, the evidence for ice on Mercury is not definitive. The anomalous reflective properties could also be due to the existence of deposits of [[metal]]lic [[sulfates]] or other materials with high reflectance.\n\n===Possible origin of ice===\nMercury is not unique in having craters that stand in permanent shadow; at the south pole of Earth's [[Moon]] there is a large crater ([[Aitken (crater)|Aitken]]) where some [[lunar ice|possible signs of the presence of ice]] have been seen (although their interpretation is disputed). It is thought by astronomers that ice on both Mercury and the Moon must have originated from external sources, mostly impacting [[comet]]s. These are known to contain large amounts, or a majority, of ice. It is therefore conceivable for meteorite impacts to have deposited water in the permanently shadow craters, where it would remain unwarmed for possibly billions of years due to the lack of an atmosphere to efficiently conduct heat and stable orientation of Mercury's [[axial tilt|rotation axis]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; width:500px;\"\n!
