The second stage began in New York City, and [[Mayor of New York|Mayor]] [[Ed Koch]], who had denounced Trump as \"one of the great hucksters\", boycotted the event. The last stage of the 10-stage 837-mile race was even more controversial. Going into the last stage, Belgian rider [[Eric Vanderaerden]] was favored to win the tour championship, but lost at least 1 minute 20 seconds when he took a wrong turn on a poorly marked course in [[Atlantic City]], riding a quarter-mile or more out of his way. He ended up finishing third overall, behind tour winner [[Dag-Otto Lauritzen]] (a Norwegian rider with the American-owned [[7-Eleven (cycling team)|7-Eleven team]]) and runner-up [[Henk Lubberding]], who also took a wrong turn during the last stage.
