But Their impacts do not restrict only vegetation, since declines in insect populations were observed after extreme drought and terrible fires during El Ni\u00f1o 2015-16 <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fran\u00e7a|first=Filipe|last2=Ferreira|first2=J| last3=Vaz-de-Mello|first3=FZ| last4=Maia|first4=LF| last5=Berenguer|first5=E| last6=Palmeira|first6=A| last7=Fadini|first7=R| last8=Louzada|first8=J| last9=Braga|first9=R| last10=Oliveira|first10=VH| last11=Barlow|first11=J| date=10 February 2020|title= El Ni\u00f1o impacts on human\u2010modified tropical forests: Consequences for dung beetle diversity and associated ecological processes |journal=Biotropica |volume=52 | issue = 1 |pages=1\u201311|doi=10.1111/btp.12756|doi-access=free}}</ref>. Declines in habitat-specialist and disturbance-sensitive bird species and in large-frugivorous mammals were also observed in Amazonian burned forests, while temporary extirpation of more than 100 lowland butterfly species occurred at a burned forest site in Borneo. \n\nMost critically, global mass bleaching events were recorded in 1997-98 and 2015\u201316, when around 75-99% losses of live coral were registered across the word. Considerable attention was also given to the collapse of Peruvian and Chilean anchovy populations that leaded to a severe fishery crisis following the ENSO events in 1972\u201373, 1982\u201383, 1997-98 and, more recently, in 2015\u201316. In particular, increased surface seawater temperatures in 1982-83 also lead to the probable extinction of two hydrocoral species in Panam\u00e1, and to a massive mortality of kelp beds along 600 km of coastline in Chile, from which kelps and associated biodiversity slowly recovered in the most affected areas even after 20 years. All these findings enlarge the role of ENSO events as a strong climatic force driving ecological changes all around the world \u2013 particularly in tropical forests and coral reefs <ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1098/rstb.2019.0116|title = Climatic and local stressor interactions threaten tropical forests and coral reefs |journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|volume = 375|issue = 1794 |pages = 20190116|year = 2020|last1 = Fran\u00e7a |first1 = FM|last2 = Benkwitt |first2 = CE|last3 = Peralta |first3 = G |last4 = Robinson |first4 = JPW|last5 = Graham|first5 =  NAJ |last6 = Tylianakis |first6 = JM|last7 = Berenguer |first7 = E |last8 = Lees |first8 = AC|last9 = Ferreira |first9 = J|last10 = Louzada |first10 = J |last11 = Barlow |first11 = J}}</ref>.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book| last = Caviedes| first = C\u00e9sar N.| title = El Ni\u00f1o in History: Storming Through the Ages| year = 2001| publisher = [[University Press of Florida]]| location = Gainesville| isbn = 978-0-8130-2099-0}}\n* {{cite book| last = Fagan| first = Brian M.| authorlink = Brian M.
