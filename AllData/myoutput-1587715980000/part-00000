The report is highly topical in regard to the Armenian Genocide, not only because it uses the 1915 events as a historic example, but also as a precedent to Articles 6 (c) and 5 (c) of the [[Nuremberg Charter|Nuremberg]] and [[Tokyo Charter]]s, and thereby as a precursor to the then newly adopted UN [[Genocide Convention]], differentiating between war crimes and crimes against humanity. By referring to the information collected during WWI and put forward by the 1919 [[Commission of Responsibilities]], the report entitled \"Information Concerning Human Rights Arising from Trials of War Criminals\" used the Armenian case as a vivid example of crimes committed by a state against its own citizens. The report also noted that while the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Treaties]] with Germany, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria, did not include any reference to \"laws of humanity\", instead basing the charges on violations of \"[[law of war|laws and customs of war]]\", The [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres|S\u00e8vres Peace Treaty]] with Turkey did so. In addition to Articles 226-228, concerning customs of war (corresponding to Articles 228-230 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]), the S\u00e8vres Treaty also contained an additional Article 230, obviously in compliance with the Allied ultimatum of May 24, 1915 in regard to \"crimes [committed] against humanity and civilization\".<ref name=\"Avedian2018\" /> {{rp|130}}\n\n==== The 1985 UN Genocide Report, the \"Whitaker Report\" ==== \nIn 1985, the [[United Nations]] [[Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities]] received a report from Special Rapporteur and Sub-Commission member [[Ben Whitaker (politician)|Benjamin Whitaker]] (United Kingdom) entitled ''Revised and Updated Report on the Question of the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide'' (commonly known as [[Whitaker Report (United Nations)|The Whitaker Report]]), in which the systematic Ottoman massacre of Armenians during World War I was cited as meeting the criteria for the UN definition of genocide and as one of the genocides of the 20th century.<ref name=unicj>{{cite journal |last1 = Sassounian |first1 = Harut |title = Genocide Recognition and a Quest for Justice |journal = Loyola Law Review |date = 2010 |volume = 32 |issue = 115 |url = http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&context=ilr }}</ref> His report was received and noted by a resolution at the 38th session of the Sub-Commission in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://undocs.org/en/E/CN.4/Sub.2/1985/6|title=E/CN.4/Sub.2/1985/6 - E - E/CN.4/Sub.2/1985/6|website=undocs.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Catholic Church ===\nIn 2015, [[Pope Francis]] said that the Armenian Genocide was \"considered the first genocide of the 20th century\".

The report also noted that while the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Treaties]] with Germany, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria, did not include any reference to \"laws of humanity\", instead basing the charges on violations of \"[[law of war|laws and customs of war]]\", The [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres|S\u00e8vres Peace Treaty]] with Turkey did so.
