Author [[Robert Neuwirth]] suggested in 2004 that there were one billion squatters globally.\n\nSquatting occurs worldwide and tends to occur when people who are poor and homeless find empty buildings or land to occupy for housing. It has a long history, broken down by country below. In [[developing countries]] and [[least developed countries]], [[shanty towns]] often begin as squatted settlements. There are [[pavement dwellers]] in India and South Africa, represented by groups such as [[Slum Dwellers International]] and [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]. In Hong Kong there are [[rooftop slum]]s. In Brazil, there are [[favelas]] and large social movements of thousands of people such as the [[Homeless Workers' Movement]] (MTST) and the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] (MST). Squatted settlements are known in Spanish-speaking countries under terms such as [[villa miseria]] (Argentina), [[pueblos j\u00f3venes]] (Peru), okupas (Chile, Spain) and [[asentamiento irregulares]] (Guatemala, Uruguay).\n\nIn [[industrialized countries]], there are often squats and also political squatting movements, which can be [[anarchist]], [[autonomist]], or [[socialist]] in nature. Oppositional movements from the 1960s and 1970s created freespaces such as [[Freetown Christiania]] in Denmark or [[Ruigoord]] in the Netherlands. Each local situation determines the context, for example in Italy there are [[Self-managed social centers in Italy|self-managed social centres]] and in Athens, Greece, there are [[Athens refugee squats|refugee squats]]. In [[Squatting in England and Wales|England and Wales]], there were estimated to be 50,000 squatters in the late 1970s.\n\n==Overview==\n{{Anarchism sidebar |Theory}}\n{{Libertarian socialism sidebar|Concepts}}\n\nThe majority of squatting is residential in nature. Squatting tends to occur when a poor and homeless population sees derelict property or land.<ref name=\"Homesteaders in the Hood\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2214544/ |last=Pe\u00f1alver |first=Eduardo M. |title=Homesteaders in the Hood |magazine=Slate Magazine |date=March 25, 2009 |access-date=April 17, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409111231/http://www.slate.com/id/2214544 |archive-date=April 9, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> According to author [[Robert Neuwirth]], there were over 1 billion (one in seven) squatters worldwide in 2004.

Social Science Research Network (SSRN). Accessed 16 April 2020.</ref> While these settlements may, in time, grow to become both legalised and indistinguishable from normal residential neighbourhoods, they often start off as squats with minimal basic infrastructure. Thus, there is no sewerage system, drinking water must be bought from vendors or carried from a nearby tap, and if there is electricity, it is stolen from a passing cable. Such settlements also exist in industrialized countries, such as for example [[Ca\u00f1ada Real]] on the outskirts of Madrid.\n\nSquatting can be related to political movements, such as [[anarchist]], [[autonomist]], or [[socialist]]. It can be a means to [[Architectural conservation|conserve buildings]] or a [[Occupation (protest)|protest]] action. Squats can be used by local communities as [[free shops]], caf\u00e9s, venues, [[pirate radio]] stations or as multi-purpose [[autonomous social centre]]s.<ref name=\"pruijt\">{{cite journal |url=http://repub.eur.nl/pub/25656 |last=Pruijt |first=Hans |title=Logic of Urban Squatting |journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research |pages=1\u20138 |date=2011 |access-date=2015-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305025411/http://repub.eur.nl/pub/25656 |archive-date=2016-03-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Typology===\nDutch sociologist Hans Pruijt separates types of squatters into five distinct categories:<ref name=\"pruijt\" />\n\n# Deprivation-based \u2013 homeless people squatting for housing need\n# An alternative housing strategy \u2013 people unprepared to wait on municipal lists to be housed take direct action \n# Entrepreneurial \u2013 people breaking into buildings to service the need of a community for cheap bars, clubs etc.\n# Conservational \u2013 preserving monuments because the authorities have let them decay\n# Political \u2013 activists squatting buildings as protests or to make social centres\n\n===Legality===\nIn many countries, squatting is in itself a [[crime]]; in others, it is only seen as a [[private law|civil conflict]] between the owner and the occupants. [[Property law]] and the [[State (polity)|state]] have traditionally favoured the property owner. However, in many cases where squatters had ''[[de facto]]'' ownership, laws have been changed to legitimize their status. Squatters often claim rights over the spaces they have squatted by virtue of occupation, rather than ownership; in this sense, squatting is similar to (and potentially a necessary condition of) [[adverse possession]], by which a possessor of [[real property]] without [[Title (property)|title]] may eventually gain legal title to the real property.\n\n[[Anarchism|Anarchist]] [[Colin Ward]] comments: \"Squatting is the oldest mode of tenure in the world, and we are all descended from squatters. This is as true of the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] [of the [[United Kingdom]]] with her {{convert|176000|acre|km2}} as it is of the 54 percent of householders in Britain who are owner-occupiers. They are all the ultimate recipients of stolen land, for to regard our planet as a commodity offends every conceivable principle of natural rights.\"<ref name=\"Corbyn\">{{cite book |last1=Wates |first1=Nick |last2=Wolmar |first2=Christian |title=Squatting: the Real Story |date=1980 |publisher=Bay Leaf Books |location=London |isbn=0-9507259-0-0}}</ref>\n\nOthers have a different view. UK [[police]] official Sue Williams, for example, has stated that \"Squatting is linked to [[anti-social behaviour]] and can cause a great deal of nuisance and distress to local residents. In some cases there may also be criminal activities involved.\"<ref>{{cite press release |title=Statement from Detective Chief Superintendent Sue Williams, Borough Commander and Chair of the Community Safety Partnership |url=http://www2.redbridge.gov.uk/cms/council_tax_benefits_housing/housing/strategy_and_development/empty_properties/police_statement_on_squatting.aspx |publisher=London Borough of Redbridge |date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2012-03-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516065913/http://www2.redbridge.gov.uk/cms/council_tax_benefits_housing/housing/strategy_and_development/empty_properties/police_statement_on_squatting.aspx |archivedate=2012-05-16 }}</ref>\n\n===Perceptions===\nThe public attitude toward squatting varies, depending on legal aspects, socioeconomic conditions, and the type of housing occupied by squatters. In particular, while squatting of municipal buildings may be treated leniently, squatting of private property often leads to strong negative reaction on the part of the public and authorities.<ref name=\"Squatting: The need for shelter versus property rights\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15776450 |last=Elms |first=Robert |title=Squatting: The need for shelter versus property rights |publisher=BBC |date=November 22, 2011 |access-date=June 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117052313/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15776450 |archive-date=November 17, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Squatting, when done in a positive and progressive manner, can be viewed as a way to reduce crime and vandalism to vacant properties, depending on the squatter's ability and willingness to conform to certain socioeconomic norms of the community in which they reside. Moreover, squatters can contribute to the maintenance or upgrading of sites that would otherwise be left unattended, the neglect of which would create (and has created) abandoned, dilapidated and decaying neighborhoods within certain sections of moderately to highly urbanized cities or [[borough]]s, one such example being New York City's [[Lower East Side|Lower Manhattan]] from roughly the 1970s to the [[9/11|post-9/11]] era of the [[New Millennium]].<ref name=\"Defining Squatter Settlements\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gdrc.org/uem/define-squatter.html |last=Srinivas |first=Hari |title=Squatting: Defining Squatter Settlements |publisher=gdrc.org |access-date=July 30, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721034747/http://www.gdrc.org/uem/define-squatter.html |archive-date=July 21, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Adverse possession===\n{{Main|Adverse possession}}\nAdverse possession, also known as squatter's rights, is a method of acquiring title to property through possession for a statutory period under certain conditions. Countries where this principle exists include England and the United States, based on common law. However, some non-common law jurisdictions have laws similar to adverse possession. For example, Louisiana has a legal doctrine called acquisitive prescription, which is derived from French law.\n\n==Africa==\nThe [[Zabbaleen]] settlement and the [[City of the Dead (slum)|City of the Dead]] are both well-known squatter communities in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].\n\nThere are large squatter communities in [[Kenya]], such as [[Kibera]] in [[Nairobi]].\n\nAn estimated 1,000 people live in the [[Grande Hotel Beira]] in [[Mozambique]].\n\nInformal settlements in [[Zambia]], particularly around [[Lusaka]], are known as [[komboni]]s.\n\n===South Africa===\nIn [[South Africa]], squatters tend to live in informal settlements or squatter camps on the outskirts of the larger cities, often but not always near [[township (South Africa)|townships]]. In the mid-1990s, an estimated 7.7 million South Africans lived in informal settlements: a fifth of the country's population.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Saff |first1=Grant |title=Claiming a Space in a Changing South Africa: The 'Squatters' of Marconi Beam, Cape Town |journal=[[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]] |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=235\u2013255 |date=1996 |issn=0004-5608 |jstor=2564004 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1996.tb01752.x }}</ref> The number has grown rapidly in the post-apartheid era. Many buildings, particularly in the [[inner city]] of [[Johannesburg]] have also been occupied by squatters. Property owners or government authorities can usually evict squatters after following certain legal procedures including requesting a court order.\n\nIn [[Durban]], the city council routinely evicts without a court order in defiance of the law, and there has been sustained conflict between the city council and a shack dwellers' movement known as [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]. The organisation has represented the squatters in land occupations such as the [[Macassar Village land occupation|Macassar Village]] in 2009 and [[Marikana land occupation (Cape Town)|Marikana]] in 2013. It has also fought against the [[KZN Slums Act]].\n\nThere have been a number of similar conflicts between shack dwellers, some linked with the [[Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign]], and the city council in [[Cape Town]]. One of the most high-profile cases was the eviction of squatters in the [[N2 Gateway]] homes in the suburb of [[Delft, Cape Town|Delft]], where over 20 residents were shot, including a three-year-old child.

Sometimes, the authorities tear the houses down, but often, the squatters simply rebuild again. The houses are built out of whatever material can be scavenged from the local area or bought cheaply. As time goes by, the squatters start to form communities and become more established. The houses are rebuilt piece by piece with more durable materials. In some cases, a deal is reached with the authorities and connections for sewage, drinking water, cable television and electricity are made.\n\nIn [[Peru]], the name given to the squatter settlements is [[pueblos j\u00f3venes]]. In [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]] they are called 'invasiones' (as in \"invading a property\", as squatting can be related to a building or an empty lot) and in [[Argentina]] they are known as [[villa miseria]].\n\nIn [[Chile]] the correct term used for the squatting is the similar term used in Spain \"Casa Okupa\". These houses share similar aspects with other squats around the world, such as being political and activist social centres. They are normally associated with the [[anarchist]] movement and they openly identify with the squatting movement, particularly the Movimiento Okupa in Spain. The mayor number of Casas Okupas are located in [[Valpara\u00edso]] and [[Santiago de Chile]]. They must not be confused with another different housing situation which term is ''Tomas''. These are particular situations of squatting that could be defined more like [[Shanty Town]]s, not necessarily involved with the Okupa movement.{{Citation needed|reason=unreferenced claims|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Brazil===\n{{Main|Favela}}\n[[File:RiodeJaneiro-Favela.jpg|thumb|right|A favela in Rio de Janeiro]]\nIn [[Brazil]], some of the squatter communities are called [[favela]]s, and a famous example is [[Rocinha]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], estimated to be home of 100,000 people. Favelas are mostly inhabited by the poorest strata, and usually lack much infrastructure and public services, but in some cases, already have reached the structure needed for a city. They are equivalent to slums or shanty towns, and typically occupy unused land (instead of unused or abandoned buildings). There were 25 million people living in favelas all over Brazil, as of 2004.<ref name=\"neuwirth\" />\n\nIn [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] the largest favela is [[Heli\u00f3polis]], with over 200,000 inhabitants. However, its occupied area has been officially recognized as a regular neighborhood of the city. There are also a number of squatter buildings in the inner city, the most famous of which was a 22-story building called [[Prestes Maia (building)|Prestes Maia]], whose inhabitants were finally evicted by the police in 2007 after a long conflict with the city administration. Inspired both by this movement and increasing property speculation and gentrification, various occupations in buildings and unoccupied areas in big cities, led by groups such as the [[Homeless Workers' Movement]] (MTST) or Downtown Roofless Movement (MSTC).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Phillips |first1=Tom |title=Brazil's roofless reclaim the cities |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/23/brazil.uknews1 |accessdate=14 April 2019 |work=Guardian |date=23 January 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414231000/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/23/brazil.uknews1 |archive-date=14 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe former Hotel Santos Dumont on Mau\u00e1 Street in the Luz neighbourhood was occupied in 2007 after being derelict for 17 years.

Author [[Robert Neuwirth]] suggested in 2004 that there were one billion squatters globally.\n\nSquatting occurs worldwide and tends to occur when people who are poor and homeless find empty buildings or land to occupy for housing. It has a long history, broken down by country below. In [[developing countries]] and [[least developed countries]], [[shanty towns]] often begin as squatted settlements. There are [[pavement dwellers]] in India and South Africa, represented by groups such as [[Slum Dwellers International]] and [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]. In Hong Kong there are [[rooftop slum]]s. In Brazil, there are [[favelas]] and large social movements of thousands of people such as the [[Homeless Workers' Movement]] (MTST) and the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] (MST). Squatted settlements are known in Spanish-speaking countries under terms such as [[villa miseria]] (Argentina), [[pueblos j\u00f3venes]] (Peru), okupas (Chile, Spain) and [[asentamiento irregulares]] (Guatemala, Uruguay).\n\nIn [[industrialized countries]] there are often squats and also political squatting movements, which can be [[anarchist]], [[autonomist]], or [[socialist]] in nature. Oppositional movements from the 1960s and 1970s created freespaces such as [[Freetown Christiania]] in Denmark or [[Ruigoord]] in the Netherlands. Each local situation determines the context, for example in Italy there are [[Self-managed social centers in Italy|self-managed social centres]] and in Athens, Greece, there are [[Athens refugee squats|refugee squats]]. In [[Squatting in England and Wales|England and Wales]], there were estimated to be 50,000 squatters in the late 1970s.\n\n==Overview==\n{{Anarchism sidebar |Theory}}\n{{Libertarian socialism sidebar|Concepts}}\n\nThe majority of squatting is residential in nature.

Thus, there is no sewerage system, drinking water must be bought from vendors or carried from a nearby tap, and if there is electricity, it is stolen from a passing cable. Such settlements also exist in industrialized countries, such as for example [[Ca\u00f1ada Real]] on the outskirts of Madrid.\n\nSquatting can be related to political movements, such as [[anarchist]], [[autonomist]], or [[socialist]]. It can be a means to [[Architectural conservation|conserve buildings]] or a [[Occupation (protest)|protest]] action. Squats can be used by local communities as [[free shops]], caf\u00e9s, venues, [[pirate radio]] stations or as multi-purpose [[autonomous social centre]]s.<ref name=\"pruijt\">{{cite journal |url=http://repub.eur.nl/pub/25656 |last=Pruijt |first=Hans |title=Logic of Urban Squatting |journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research |pages=1\u20138 |date=2011 |access-date=2015-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305025411/http://repub.eur.nl/pub/25656 |archive-date=2016-03-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Typology===\nDutch sociologist Hans Pruijt separates types of squatters into five distinct categories:<ref name=\"pruijt\" />\n\n# Deprivation-based \u2013 homeless people squatting for housing need\n# An alternative housing strategy \u2013 people unprepared to wait on municipal lists to be housed take direct action \n# Entrepreneurial \u2013 people breaking into buildings to service the need of a community for cheap bars, clubs etc.\n# Conservational \u2013 preserving monuments because the authorities have let them decay\n# Political \u2013 activists squatting buildings as protests or to make social centres\n\n===Legality===\nIn many countries, squatting is in itself a [[crime]]; in others, it is only seen as a [[private law|civil conflict]] between the owner and the occupants. [[Property law]] and the [[State (polity)|state]] have traditionally favoured the property owner. However, in many cases where squatters had ''[[de facto]]'' ownership, laws have been changed to legitimize their status. Squatters often claim rights over the spaces they have squatted by virtue of occupation, rather than ownership; in this sense, squatting is similar to (and potentially a necessary condition of) [[adverse possession]], by which a possessor of [[real property]] without [[Title (property)|title]] may eventually gain legal title to the real property.\n\n[[Anarchism|Anarchist]] [[Colin Ward]] comments: \"Squatting is the oldest mode of tenure in the world, and we are all descended from squatters. This is as true of the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] [of the [[United Kingdom]]] with her {{convert|176000|acre|km2}} as it is of the 54 percent of householders in Britain who are owner-occupiers.

UK [[police]] official Sue Williams, for example, has stated that \"Squatting is linked to [[anti-social behaviour]] and can cause a great deal of nuisance and distress to local residents. In some cases there may also be criminal activities involved.\"<ref>{{cite press release |title=Statement from Detective Chief Superintendent Sue Williams, Borough Commander and Chair of the Community Safety Partnership |url=http://www2.redbridge.gov.uk/cms/council_tax_benefits_housing/housing/strategy_and_development/empty_properties/police_statement_on_squatting.aspx |publisher=London Borough of Redbridge |date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2012-03-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516065913/http://www2.redbridge.gov.uk/cms/council_tax_benefits_housing/housing/strategy_and_development/empty_properties/police_statement_on_squatting.aspx |archivedate=2012-05-16 }}</ref>\n\n===Perceptions===\nThe public attitude toward squatting varies, depending on legal aspects, socioeconomic conditions, and the type of housing occupied by squatters.

Moreover, squatters can contribute to the maintenance or upgrading of sites that would otherwise be left unattended, the neglect of which would create (and has created) abandoned, dilapidated and decaying neighborhoods within certain sections of moderately to highly urbanized cities or [[borough]]s, one such example being New York City's [[Lower East Side|Lower Manhattan]] from roughly the 1970s to the [[9/11|post-9/11]] era of the [[New Millennium]].<ref name=\"Defining Squatter Settlements\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gdrc.org/uem/define-squatter.html |last=Srinivas |first=Hari |title=Squatting: Defining Squatter Settlements |publisher=gdrc.org |access-date=July 30, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721034747/http://www.gdrc.org/uem/define-squatter.html |archive-date=July 21, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Adverse possession===\n{{Main|Adverse possession}}\nAdverse possession, also known as squatter's rights, is a method of acquiring title to property through possession for a statutory period under certain conditions. Countries where this principle exists include England and the United States, based on common law. However, some non-common law jurisdictions have laws similar to adverse possession. For example, Louisiana has a legal doctrine called acquisitive prescription, which is derived from French law.\n\n==Africa==\nThe [[Zabbaleen]] settlement and the [[City of the Dead (slum)|City of the Dead]] are both well-known squatter communities in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].\n\nThere are large squatter communities in [[Kenya]], such as [[Kibera]] in [[Nairobi]].\n\nAn estimated 1,000 people live in the [[Grande Hotel Beira]] in [[Mozambique]].\n\nInformal settlements in [[Zambia]], particularly around [[Lusaka]], are known as [[komboni]]s.\n\n===South Africa===\nIn [[South Africa]], squatters tend to live in informal settlements or squatter camps on the outskirts of the larger cities, often but not always near [[township (South Africa)|townships]].

In [[Berlin]], the now-legalised squats are in desirable areas such as [[Mitte]] and [[Prenzlauer Berg]]. Before the reunification, squats in Berlin were mostly located in former [[West Berlin]]'s borough of [[Kreuzberg]]. The squats were mainly for residential and social use. Squatting became known by the term ''instandbesetzen'', from ''instandsetzen'' (\"renovating\") and ''besetzen'' (\"occupying\").<ref name=\"pruijt\" />\n\nSquatters moved into the former factory site of [[J.A. Topf & S\u00f6hne]] in [[Erfurt]] in April 2001 and remained there until they were evicted by police in April 2009. The firm made crematoria for [[Nazi concentration camps]]. The squatters ran culture programs which drew attention to the history of the company. The occupation was known simply as ''Das Besetzte Haus'' (the occupied house) and was one of the most well known actions of left-radicals of that period in Germany. A book about the occupation was published in 2012, titled ''Topf & S\u00f6hne - Besetzung auf einem T\u00e4terort'' (Topf & S\u00f6hne - Occupation of a crime scene).<ref name=besetz>Meyerbeer, Karl; Sp\u00e4th, Pascal (eds) (2012) ''Topf & S\u00f6hne - Besetzung auf einem T\u00e4terort''.

Sometimes, the authorities tear the houses down, but often, the squatters simply rebuild again. The houses are built out of whatever material can be scavenged from the local area or bought cheaply. As time goes by, the squatters start to form communities and become more established. The houses are rebuilt piece by piece with more durable materials. In some cases, a deal is reached with the authorities and connections for sewage, drinking water, cable television and electricity are made.\n\nIn [[Peru]], the name given to the squatter settlements is [[pueblos j\u00f3venes]]. In [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]] they are called 'invasiones' (as in \"invading a property\", as squatting can be related to a building or an empty lot) and in [[Argentina]] they are known as [[villa miseria]].\n\nIn [[Chile]] the correct term used for the squatting is the similar term used in Spain \"Casa Okupa\". These houses share similar aspects with other squats around the world, such as being political and activist social centres. They are normally associated with the [[anarchist]] movement and they openly identify with the squatting movement, particularly the Movimiento Okupa in Spain. The mayor number of Casas Okupas are located in [[Valpara\u00edso]] and [[Santiago de Chile]]. They must not be confused with another different housing situation which term is ''Tomas''. These are particular situations of squatting that could be defined more like [[Shanty Town]]s, not necessarily involved with the Okupa movement.{{Citation needed|reason=unreferenced claims|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Brazil===\n{{Main|Favela}}\n[[File:RiodeJaneiro-Favela.jpg|thumb|right|A favela in Rio de Janeiro]]\nIn [[Brazil]], some of the squatter communities are called [[favela]]s, and a famous example is [[Rocinha]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], estimated to be home of 100,000 people. Favelas are mostly inhabited by the poorest strata, and usually lack much infrastructure and public services, but in some cases, already have reached the structure needed for a city.

There were 25 million people living in favelas all over Brazil, as of 2004.<ref name=\"neuwirth\" />\n\nIn [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] the largest favela is [[Heli\u00f3polis]], with over 200,000 inhabitants.
