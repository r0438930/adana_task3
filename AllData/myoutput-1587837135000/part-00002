He attended schools in Niagara, Dunneville and [[Montreal]], as his father moved for work. In 1912, he enrolled at [[McGill University]] in Montreal to study engineering. While at McGill he joined [[Zeta Psi Fraternity]].

By this time, he had been posted to the regiment's [[13th Battalion, CEF|13th Battalion]]. For the next few months, the battalion underwent training on the [[Salisbury Plains]], during which time Fisher was promoted to [[lance corporal]]. In March 1915, the battalion departed for the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]].{{sfn|Batchelor|Matson|2011|pp=92\u201393}}\n\nAs part of 3rd Brigade, [[1st Canadian Division]], Fisher's battalion was stationed near St. Julien in the [[Ypres Salient]], with the French 45th Division, made up of Moroccan troops on its left.{{sfn|Batchelor|Matson|2011|pp=90\u201391}} To open the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], on the evening of 22 April 1915, near [[Saint Julien Memorial|St Julien, Belgium]], the Germans released [[Chemical warfare|poison gas]], the first instance of chemical warfare.

His actions allowed for the battery to initially remove the immediate threat posed by the Germans and continue firing and then for its guns eventually hauled to safety later in the evening. Early the next morning, 23 April, when Fisher had obtained four more men from the 14th Battalion, he went forward again into St. Julien to fire on the swarming Germans. Meanwhile, the 13th Battalion positioned on the extreme left of the Canadian Division's sector was under heavy fire.
