Bailey''', (born August 10, 1935), is an [[United States|American]] [[author]] and [[humorist]] who also used the [[pen name]] of R. Adam Solo.\n\nBailey's original name was Marion Bruce Bailey, but he was called \"Bruce\" by family and friends.  Upon entering the military, he was informed that he would be addressed by his first name, not middle name or a nickname.   He immediately proceeded to the local court house and officially changed his name to Bruce Marion Bailey.  Bruce spent a career in the military flying reconnaissance missions, and upon retiring turned to writing.\n\n==Early life==\nBruce was born in [[Crystal Springs, Mississippi|Crystal Springs]], [[Mississippi]], a rural agricultural town, and spent his youth there involved in typical activities of a small town boy.  He was first son of Sidney Bailey and Flayvelle Florence Bruce, his brother John was borne 12 years later.  Bruce was highly intelligent and often found mischief and mayhem as he sought fun and fulfillment in a small town.  During his youth he developed a great love for aviation and aircraft of all types.  As many of America's youth did, he watched the aircraft and the [[United States Army Air Forces|AAF]] with close interest during the second world war, collecting as many cards, pictures, and data about military airframes as possible.\n\n===Military career===\nHe served as Honorary Sergeant and Bugler for an elite National Guard unit for 4 years while still in school (grades 6-10). He started college at Mississippi State and bounced from school to school for nearly 2 years before enlisting in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. He spent 2 years as a reservist in and out of [[Camp Lejeune]] and [[Okinawa]], but Marine life did not suit him. He often said the only thing they taught was how to hate and fight, so transferred to the [[U.S. Air Force]] Aviation Cadet program designed to commission officers for flight duties (pilots and navigators). Cadets enabled him to fulfill his dream of flying. His latest book, ''The Elite'', tells of his time spent in that program.\n\nHis career in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] (1956\u201377) was spent primarily as an [[Electronics Warfare Officer]] flying [[reconnaissance]] missions during the [[cold war]].  He has written several books on the subject and has become a sought-after authority.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.coldwar.org/museum/coldwar_stories.asp | title=Cold War Stories, Oral Histories, and Personal Stories: Additional Tales of the Cold War | publisher=[[Cold War Museum]] | accessdate=April 21, 2015}}</ref>\nBruce has flown different types of aircraft, but most of his 9,000 hours were spent in the [[RB-47]] and [[RC-135]].\nThroughout most of his career he flew combat missions and wore the [[Combat Crew badge]].\nDuring the height of the [[Cold War]] he was constantly either \"On Call\" or deployed.\nAir Force life was much better suited to Bruce.\nHe was a highly effective leader and widely recognized as such by his peer and superior officers.\nThe Air Force also allowed him to put his intellectual capacity to work.\nQuickly mastering electronics and [[Radio Frequency]] theory and processing, he quickly dominated his specialized field within the community.\nBy the time of his retirement, Bruce had been awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]], the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] several times, and many other medals and awards.{{Vague|date=May 2010}}  His life in the military enabled him to travel the world where he had the opportunity to meet and interact with a wide range of people and cultures.\n\n===Life as an Author===\nUpon retirement, he turned his attention to writing and has published several volumes of historical fiction and non-fiction.
