Romualdez Airport|airport]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:TAKLUB.JPG|thumb|left|Street performers carrying ''taklub'' on their backs (Tacloban takes its name from the ''taklub'', a bamboo fish-catching contraption).]]\nTacloban was first known as ''Kankabatok'', an allusion to the first inhabitants &ndash; ''Kabatok''. They established their dwellings in the vicinity of the present day Santo Ni\u00f1o Church. Others who came later were Gumoda, Haraging and Huraw who erected their own settlements in nearby sites. Huraw's domain is the hill where the city hall now sits. The combined settlements acquired the name ''Kankabatok'', meaning ''Kabatok{{'}}s'' property.\n\nThe constant threat of pirates due to its lack of a natural barrier hindered the development and progress of the settlement.  And so the place never figured out in the early centuries of the Spanish colonization of Leyte. When the Jesuits (the first evangelizers of Leyte) left in 1768, the Augustinians took over and in 1770 they established the barrio with a chapel (visita) of Tacloban under the jurisdiction of Palo.  The Augustinians who came from the Province of the Holy Name of Jesus based in Cebu were also responsible in introducing the devotion to the Santo Ni\u00f1o becoming therefore the heavenly patron of the settlement.  With the Moro raids in check, the place became a hub for commercial activity and soon after the place was renamed Tacloban becoming an independent municipality and then capital of the province of Leyte.  In 1843, the Augustinians ceded the administration of the parish to the Franciscans.\n\nThe change of the name came about in this manner: ''Kankabatok'' was a favorite haunt of fishermen.  They would use a bamboo contraption called a ''\"taklub\"'' to catch crabs, shrimps or fish. When asked where they were going, the fishermen would answer, ''\"(to) tarakluban\"'', which meant the place where they used the device to catch these marine resources. Eventually, the name ''Tarakluban'' or Tacloban took prominence.\n\nIt is not known when Tacloban became a municipality because records supporting this fact were destroyed during a typhoon. It is commonly believed that Tacloban was officially proclaimed a municipality in 1770s. In 1768, Leyte and Samar were separated into two provinces, each constituting a politico-military province. Due to its strategic location, Tacloban became a vital trading point between the two provinces.\n\nThe capital of Leyte was transferred from one town to another with Tacloban as the last on 26 February 1830. The decision to make Tacloban the capital was based on the following reasons: 1) ideal location of the port and 2) well-sheltered and adequate facilities. On 20 June 1952, Tacloban was proclaimed a chartered city by virtue of Republic Act No. 760.<ref name=RA760 />\n\n[[File:Tacloban Turnover ceremony statue.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Statue of Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur]] and President [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]]]]\nThe arrival of [[Arthur Murray (colonel)|Colonel Murray]] in 1901 made him the first military governor of Leyte. His first official act was the opening of Tacloban port to world commerce. Before [[World War II]], Tacloban was the commercial, education, social and cultural center of the Province of Leyte. [[Copra]] and [[abaca]] were exported in large quantities. The leading institutions were: Leyte Normal School, Leyte High School, Leyte Trade School, Holy Infant Academy and Tacloban Catholic Institute.\n\nIn November 1912, a typhoon swept through the central Philippines and \"practically destroyed\" Tacloban. In Tacloban and [[Capiz]] on the island of [[Panay]], the death toll was 15,000, half the population of those cities at the time.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045433/1912-11-30/ed-1/seq-1/ |title= 15,000 Die in Philippine Storm |newspaper=Washington Herald |date=30 November 1912 |accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 May 1942, Japanese forces landed in Tacloban, signalling the beginning of their two-year occupation of Leyte. They fortified the city and improved its airfield. Since San Pedro Bay was ideal for larger vessels, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Imperial Naval Forces]] made Tacloban a port of call and entry. This time was considered the darkest in the history of Tacloban and the country due to the incidences of torture among civilians, including the elderly. In response, guerrilla groups operated in Leyte &ndash; the most notable of which was the group of [[Ruperto Kangleon]].\n\nLeyte was the first to be liberated by the combined Filipino and American troops. [[General Douglas MacArthur]]'s assault troops landed in the Tacloban and Palo beaches (White Beach and Red Beach, respectively) and in the neighboring town of Dulag (Blue Beach) on 20 October 1944. These landings signaled the eventual victory of the Filipino and American forces and the fulfillment of MacArthur's famous promise: \"I Shall Return.\"\n\nThree days later, on 23 October, at a ceremony at the Capitol Building in Tacloban, MacArthur, accompanied by President [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]], made Tacloban the temporary seat of the Commonwealth Government and temporary capital of the Philippines until the complete liberation of the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1944/10/23/proclamation-of-general-douglas-macarthur-to-the-people-of-the-philippines-october-23-1944/|title=Proclamation of General Douglas MacArthur to the People of the Philippines, October 23, 1944|last=|first=|date=23 October 1944|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=21 February 2018}}</ref> The provincial government of Leyte and the municipal government of Tacloban were re-established.\n\nPaulo Jaro was the Liberation mayor of Tacloban.

Tropical rainforest climates are tropical climates in which there is no dry season &ndash; all months have mean precipitation values of at least {{convert|60| mm|in|1}}. Tropical rainforest climates have no pronounced summer or winter; it is typically hot and wet throughout the year and rainfall is both heavy and frequent. One day in an equatorial climate can be very similar to the next, while the change in temperature between day and night may be larger than the average change in temperature between \"summer\" and \"winter\".\n\nThe average high (daytime) temperature for the year in Tacloban is {{convert|31.1|C|F|1}}.

\n}}\n\nAccording to the 2015 census, Tacloban has a population of 242,089 inhabitants. \n\nTacloban is predominantly a [[Waray-Waray language|Waray-speaking]] city. The language is also officially called ''Lineyte-Samarnon'' (\"Leyte-Samarnon\") and spoken by more than 90% of the total city population.  [[Waray-Waray language|Waray-Waray]], aside from being the native language of the city, is also the lingua franca used in the city among Filipinos of various ethnic groups.\n\nTacloban is culturally and linguistically diverse. A decade before the end of Spanish sovereignty, it was largely a typical colonial community: most of its residents were either pure Iberian families or the new generations of Spanish-Filipino blood. Today's population consists of a mix of Spanish and Chinese mestizos, foreign expatriates and native Leyte\u00f1os.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nOther Filipino ethnic groups who migrated in the city are Cebuano/Kana/Visayan speaking populace accounts 6.08% of the total population, 0.80% are Tagalog, 0.10% are Ilocano, 0.07% are Kapampangan while 2.95% come from other ethnic origins.\n\n88.52% of the residents of Tacloban City are Roman Catholic; 6.12% are [[Islam|Muslim]]s (most are Maranao migrants from Mindanao); 0.83% are of the indigenous Christian denomination, Iglesia ni Cristo; 0.94% are Evangelicals (born-again Christians); Baptists 0.80%; 0.49% Seventh Day Adventists. Others comprise 3.10%.\n\n==Economy==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Downtown_Tacloban_01.JPG|thumb|Avenida Rizal, downtown area of Tacloban.]]\nTacloban is the economic center of Eastern Visayas, with an economy largely focused on commerce, tourism, trade, education, culture, and government in the region. Several regional broadcasters are based in the city, including ABS-CBN TV-2 Tacloban, PRTV-12 Tacloban and its regional newscasts, \"[[TV Patrol Eastern Visayas]]\" and \"Sumat ha Dose\" respectively.\n\nEconomically, Tacloban is one of the fastest growing cities in the Philippines. It has one of the lowest poverty incidence rates in the country (at roughly 9%, while the national poverty incidence stands at 30%), and is the richest local government unit in Eastern Visayas.\n\nAfter its massive devastation on 8 November 2013, Tacloban is now considered as a 'start up' city, which means everything has to start back from scratch. Currently the city is experiencing a rapid economic bounce back, and is dubbed as the 'rising phoenix of the East' surviving its challenges that once made the city classified into \"ground zero\". The [[Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport]] also makes this city a key regional transportation hub.\n\nIn the mid-90s, Tacloban City worked out the acquisition of {{convert|237|ha|acre}} for its Economic Zone, which was finally realized and approved by the Philippine Economic Zone Authority, by virtue of Presidential Proclamation No. 1210 on 23 April 1998. The Eastern Visayas Agri-Industrial Growth Center (EVRGC) was then officially registered as an Eco-Zone with the City Government of Tacloban as the developer/operator.\n\n==Government==\n\n[[File:Tacloban City Hall 2016.jpg|thumb|left|''Kanhuraw'' &ndash; this nickname of the Tacloban City Hall is also the name of the hill where the building stands.]]\nThe executive power of the City Government is vested in the mayor.  The ''[[Sangguniang Panlungsod]]'' or the city council has the legislative power to create city ordinances.  It is a unicameral body composed of ten elected councilors and certain numbers of ex officio and sectoral representatives.  It is presided by the vice mayor, the mayor and the elected city councilors who are elected-at-large every three years. The current city mayor is Alfred Romualdez.\n\nThe city government ceased to be under the supervision of the provincial government after it became a Highly Urbanized City in 2008.  The city is now under the direct supervision of the national government.\n\nTacloban City is part of the [[Legislative districts of Leyte#1st District|1st District of Leyte]], alongside seven other municipalities: [[Alangalang, Leyte|Alangalang]], [[Babatngon, Leyte|Babatngon]], [[Palo, Leyte|Palo]], [[San Miguel, Leyte|San Miguel]], [[Santa Fe, Leyte|Santa Fe]], [[Tanauan, Leyte|Tanauan]], and [[Tolosa, Leyte|Tolosa]]. The district is currently represented by Congressman [[Martin Romualdez]].\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Official seal of the city of Tacloban===\n\n[[file:Ph seal Tacloban.png|right|150px|Tacloban City Official Seal]]\nThe official Seal of Tacloban is the symbol of the city's identity when it became a city under Republic Act No. 760 on 20 June 1952.\n\nThe city's emblem stands for the following physical attributes and character:<ref>{{cite web\n| title      = City Seal\n| url        = http://tacloban.gov.ph/?page_id=215\n| date       = \n| accessdate = 30 March 2013\n| publisher  = Official website of the City Government of Tacloban\n}}</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n*'''Left Portion''' - Symbolizes the province of Samar ([[Santa Rita, Samar|Santa Rita]]), major supplier of agricultural and marine products to the city, stabilizing its volume of business and trade.\n*'''Center''' - Stands for the beautiful and scenic San Juanico Strait\n*'''The Galleon''' - Illustrates the ship of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] who discovered the island of [[Limasawa, Southern Leyte|Limasawa]] where the first Christian mass was held in Philippine soil.\n*'''Right Portion''' - Leyte side, where Tacloban City is Located\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:PIN-KAS6.JPG|thumb|left|Dancers during the Pintados Festival in 2008]]\nThe week-long celebrations peaks on 30 June,<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno7676.html#.UUl7XpAZ5H0\n| title      = REPUBLIC ACT NO. 7676 - AN ACT DECLARING JUNE THIRTY OF EVERY YEAR A SPECIAL NONWORKING PUBLIC HOLIDAY IN TACLOBAN CITY, PROVINCE OF LEYTE, TO BE KNOWN AS \"TACLOBAN DAY\"\n| date       = 10 January 1994\n| accessdate = 20 March 2013\n}}\n</ref> the Grand fiesta of Tacloban celebrated with the traditional turn-over ceremonies of the \"Teniente\" made by the immediate past Hermano Mayor to the incoming Hermano Mayor. This is accompanied by the ritual of giving the medallion containing the names of all Hermanos Pasados and the Standartes. Fireworks and grand parades mark the occasion. Every house in the city prepares a feast and opens its doors to guests and well wishers.\n\n;Subiran Regatta: Subiran Regatta is a race of one-man native sailboats with outriggers locally called \"subiran\" along scenic and historic [[Leyte Gulf]]. The race is done without using a paddle but only skills and techniques to manoeuvre the sail. The Subiran Regatta is now on its 32nd year and counting. This contest is done annually on that weeklong celebration of the Tacloban City Fiesta. The race aims to preserve the art of sailing with the wind alone, and to showcase the mastery of this art by local boatmen.\n\n;Balyuan: Organized by the Department of Tourism and the city government, this activity which only started in 1975 is supposedly a re-enactment of a purported exchange of images between Barrio Buscada of [[Basey, Samar|Basey]] and Sitio Kankabatok, now Tacloban City.  A local story which only saw print in the 20th century purports that in the old days, Sitio Kankabatok was a small barrio under the jurisdiction of Basey town in Samar. During the Feast of Santo Ni\u00f1o, the residents of Sitio Kankabatok would borrow the bigger image of the saint from the chapel of Barrio Buscada in Basey. Santo Ni\u00f1o is the revered patron saint of both Kankabatok and Barrio Buscada. The image is returned promptly after the festivities. When Kankabatok grew into a barrio of its own, the local Catholic authorities decided that the bigger Santo Ni\u00f1o image be retained in prospering village. However, because of its highly questionable anthropological and historical basis, the story can be best understood as simply etiological.  It gives witness to the cultural, ethnographical and historical relationship between the people of south Samar and the eastern seaboard of Leyte.  Likewise, stories of the image missing in Buscada and turning up in Kankabatok aided to this decision of honoring this relationship. The Basey Flotilla bearing the church and government leaders goes on a fluvial procession along San Pedro Bay. A budyong (shell) call announces the sight of the flotilla off Kankabatok Bay.\n\n;Sangyaw Festival: [[Sangyaw]] is an archaic Waray word which means to herald the news. The Sangyaw Festival was created by [[Imelda Marcos]] in the 1980s. The festival was revived in 2008 by her nephew, current city mayor Alfred Romualdez. The Sangyaw Festival invites contingents of different performing groups of various festivals in the country to compete in this side of the region. Cash prizes and trophies are at stake as the Sangyaw Festival grooms itself to be a big festival to watch out in the succeeding years.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{stack|float=right\n|[[File:San Juanico Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The San Juanico Bridge, north of the city]]\n|[[File:Sto.

Located at the corner of Sen. Enage Street and Magsaysay Boulevard, the \"Capitolio\" is the seat of the provincial government of Leyte. It was also the seat of the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines when President Sergio Osme\u00f1a landed here in 1944 with the WWII Liberation Forces. The Capitol was damaged in 2013 by [[Typhoon Haiyan]].\n\n;Tacloban Metropolitan Arena: Popularly known as the \"Astrodome,\" the [[Tacloban City Convention Center]] is a 5,000-seat indoor arena which is now the perfect location for basketball tourneys and other sporting activities, concerts and other big gatherings like the \"Search for Ms. Tacloban\". It also houses many bars and businesses. The arena was severely damaged by [[Typhoon Haiyan]] but still served as an evacuation center after the typhoon devastation.\n\n;People's Center Library: The library houses a collection of books of different cultures from around the globe &ndash;  USA, Europe and other countries &ndash; including French, Spanish and English literature as well as a compilation of law books.  The People's Center Library is used by local students as well as researchers. It is like a Greek building that houses the collection of books such as [[Imelda Marcos]]'s. It is the alleged oldest library in Tacloban and the whole Eastern Visayas (Region VIII).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://intrepidwanderer.com/2013/07/peoples-center-and-library-the-house-of-books-in-tacloban/|title=People's Center and Library: The House of Books in Tacloban}}</ref>\n\n;Balyuan Park: Balyuan Park is located at the grounds of Magsaysay Boulevard.

It is located at the Kanhuraw Hill near City Hall, facing Kankabato Bay. During the Second World War, the place became a campground for Japanese soldiers.\n\n;Redo\u00f1a Residence: The Redo\u00f1a Residence was one of the remaining houses built at the turn of the 19th century. The historic mansion was a showcase of Filipino craftsmanship and architecture, but in need of serious restoration. It was the official residence of President Sergio Osme\u00f1a, Sr. in 1944, when Leyte was the seat of the Philippine government during the Liberation from the Japanese campaign until Philippine Commonwealth was re-established in Manila. On 7 March 2018, the Redo\u00f1a Residence was demolished under the directives of Margarito Redo\u00f1a's daughter Cristina Pablo, who cited the lack of support from the local government in the restoration of the heritage site as one instrumental reason for its demolition.<ref>https://www.leytesamardailynews.com/vanished-world-war-ii-heritage-house-saddens-owner/</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Daniel Z.

Romualdez Airport|airport]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:TAKLUB.JPG|thumb|left|Street performers carrying ''taklub'' on their backs (Tacloban takes its name from the ''taklub'', a bamboo fish-catching contraption).]]\nTacloban was first known as ''Kankabatok'', an allusion to the first inhabitants &ndash; ''Kabatok''. They established their dwellings in the vicinity of the present day Santo Ni\u00f1o Church. Others who came later were Gumoda, Haraging and Huraw who erected their own settlements in nearby sites. Huraw's domain is the hill where the city hall now sits. The combined settlements acquired the name ''Kankabatok'', meaning ''Kabatok{{'}}s'' property.\n\nThe constant threat of pirates due to its lack of a natural barrier hindered the development and progress of the settlement.  And so the place never figured out in the early centuries of the Spanish colonization of Leyte. When the Jesuits (the first evangelizers of Leyte) left in 1768, the Augustinians took over and in 1770 they established the barrio with a chapel (visita) of Tacloban under the jurisdiction of Palo.  The Augustinians who came from the Province of the Holy Name of Jesus based in Cebu were also responsible in introducing the devotion to the Santo Ni\u00f1o becoming therefore the heavenly patron of the settlement.  With the Moro raids in check, the place became a hub for commercial activity and soon after the place was renamed Tacloban becoming an independent municipality and then capital of the province of Leyte.  In 1843, the Augustinians ceded the administration of the parish to the Franciscans.\n\nThe change of the name came about in this manner: ''Kankabatok'' was a favorite haunt of fishermen.  They would use a bamboo contraption called a ''\"taklub\"'' to catch crabs, shrimps or fish. When asked where they were going, the fishermen would answer, ''\"(to) tarakluban\"'', which meant the place where they used the device to catch these marine resources. Eventually, the name ''Tarakluban'' or Tacloban took prominence.\n\nIt is not known when Tacloban became a municipality because records supporting this fact were destroyed during a typhoon. It is commonly believed that Tacloban was officially proclaimed a municipality in 1770s. In 1768, Leyte and Samar were separated into two provinces, each constituting a politico-military province. Due to its strategic location, Tacloban became a vital trading point between the two provinces.\n\nThe capital of Leyte was transferred from one town to another with Tacloban as the last on 26 February 1830. The decision to make Tacloban the capital was based on the following reasons: 1) ideal location of the port and 2) well-sheltered and adequate facilities. On 20 June 1952, Tacloban was proclaimed a chartered city by virtue of Republic Act No. 760.<ref name=RA760 />\n\n[[File:Tacloban Turnover ceremony statue.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Statue of Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur]] and President [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]]]]\nThe arrival of [[Arthur Murray (colonel)|Colonel Murray]] in 1901 made him the first military governor of Leyte. His first official act was the opening of Tacloban port to world commerce. Before [[World War II]], Tacloban was the commercial, education, social and cultural center of the Province of Leyte.

The leading institutions were: Leyte Normal School, Leyte High School, Leyte Trade School, Holy Infant Academy and Tacloban Catholic Institute.\n\nIn November 1912, a typhoon swept through the central Philippines and \"practically destroyed\" Tacloban. In Tacloban and [[Capiz]] on the island of [[Panay]], the death toll was 15,000, half the population of those cities at the time.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045433/1912-11-30/ed-1/seq-1/ |title= 15,000 Die in Philippine Storm |newspaper=Washington Herald |date=30 November 1912 |accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 May 1942, Japanese forces landed in Tacloban, signalling the beginning of their two-year occupation of Leyte. They fortified the city and improved its airfield. Since San Pedro Bay was ideal for larger vessels, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Imperial Naval Forces]] made Tacloban a port of call and entry. This time was considered the darkest in the history of Tacloban and the country due to the incidences of torture among civilians, including the elderly. In response, guerrilla groups operated in Leyte &ndash; the most notable of which was the group of [[Ruperto Kangleon]].\n\nLeyte was the first to be liberated by the combined Filipino and American troops. [[General Douglas MacArthur]]'s assault troops landed in the Tacloban and Palo beaches (White Beach and Red Beach, respectively) and in the neighboring town of Dulag (Blue Beach) on 20 October 1944. These landings signaled the eventual victory of the Filipino and American forces and the fulfillment of MacArthur's famous promise: \"I Shall Return.\"\n\nThree days later, on 23 October, at a ceremony at the Capitol Building in Tacloban, MacArthur, accompanied by President [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]], made Tacloban the temporary seat of the Commonwealth Government and temporary capital of the Philippines until the complete liberation of the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1944/10/23/proclamation-of-general-douglas-macarthur-to-the-people-of-the-philippines-october-23-1944/|title=Proclamation of General Douglas MacArthur to the People of the Philippines, October 23, 1944|last=|first=|date=23 October 1944|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=21 February 2018}}</ref> The provincial government of Leyte and the municipal government of Tacloban were re-established.\n\nPaulo Jaro was the Liberation mayor of Tacloban.

The language is also officially called ''Lineyte-Samarnon'' (\"Leyte-Samarnon\") and spoken by more than 90% of the total city population.  [[Waray-Waray language|Waray-Waray]], aside from being the native language of the city, is also the lingua franca used in the city among Filipinos of various ethnic groups.\n\nTacloban is culturally and linguistically diverse. A decade before the end of Spanish sovereignty, it was largely a typical colonial community: most of its residents were either pure Iberian families or the new generations of Spanish-Filipino blood. Today's population consists of a mix of Spanish and Chinese mestizos, foreign expatriates and native Leyte\u00f1os.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nOther Filipino ethnic groups who migrated in the city are Cebuano/Kana/Visayan speaking populace accounts 6.08% of the total population, 0.80% are Tagalog, 0.10% are Ilocano, 0.07% are Kapampangan while 2.95% come from other ethnic origins.\n\n88.52% of the residents of Tacloban City are Roman Catholic; 6.12% are [[Islam|Muslim]]s (most are Maranao migrants from Mindanao); 0.83% are of the indigenous Christian denomination, Iglesia ni Cristo; 0.94% are Evangelicals (born-again Christians); Baptists 0.80%; 0.49% Seventh Day Adventists. Others comprise 3.10%.\n\n==Economy==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Downtown_Tacloban_01.JPG|thumb|Avenida Rizal, downtown area of Tacloban.]]\nTacloban is the economic center of Eastern Visayas, with an economy largely focused on commerce, tourism, trade, education, culture, and government in the region. Several regional broadcasters are based in the city, including ABS-CBN TV-2 Tacloban, PRTV-12 Tacloban and its regional newscasts, \"[[TV Patrol Eastern Visayas]]\" and \"Sumat ha Dose\" respectively.\n\nEconomically, Tacloban is one of the fastest growing cities in the Philippines. It has one of the lowest poverty incidence rates in the country (at roughly 9%, while the national poverty incidence stands at 30%), and is the richest local government unit in Eastern Visayas.\n\nAfter its massive devastation on 8 November 2013, Tacloban is now considered as a 'start up' city, which means everything has to start back from scratch. Currently the city is experiencing a rapid economic bounce back, and is dubbed as the 'rising phoenix of the East' surviving its challenges that once made the city classified into \"ground zero\". The [[Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport]] also makes this city a key regional transportation hub.\n\nIn the mid-90s, Tacloban City worked out the acquisition of {{convert|237|ha|acre}} for its Economic Zone, which was finally realized and approved by the Philippine Economic Zone Authority, by virtue of Presidential Proclamation No. 1210 on 23 April 1998. The Eastern Visayas Agri-Industrial Growth Center (EVRGC) was then officially registered as an Eco-Zone with the City Government of Tacloban as the developer/operator.\n\n==Government==\n\n[[File:Tacloban City Hall 2016.jpg|thumb|left|''Kanhuraw'' &ndash; this nickname of the Tacloban City Hall is also the name of the hill where the building stands.]]\nThe executive power of the City Government is vested in the mayor.  The ''[[Sangguniang Panlungsod]]'' or the city council has the legislative power to create city ordinances.  It is a unicameral body composed of ten elected councilors and certain numbers of ex officio and sectoral representatives.  It is presided by the vice mayor, the mayor and the elected city councilors who are elected-at-large every three years. The current city mayor is Alfred Romualdez.\n\nThe city government ceased to be under the supervision of the provincial government after it became a Highly Urbanized City in 2008.  The city is now under the direct supervision of the national government.\n\nTacloban City is part of the [[Legislative districts of Leyte#1st District|1st District of Leyte]], alongside seven other municipalities: [[Alangalang, Leyte|Alangalang]], [[Babatngon, Leyte|Babatngon]], [[Palo, Leyte|Palo]], [[San Miguel, Leyte|San Miguel]], [[Santa Fe, Leyte|Santa Fe]], [[Tanauan, Leyte|Tanauan]], and [[Tolosa, Leyte|Tolosa]].

This is accompanied by the ritual of giving the medallion containing the names of all Hermanos Pasados and the Standartes. Fireworks and grand parades mark the occasion. Every house in the city prepares a feast and opens its doors to guests and well wishers.\n\n;Subiran Regatta: Subiran Regatta is a race of one-man native sailboats with outriggers locally called \"subiran\" along scenic and historic [[Leyte Gulf]]. The race is done without using a paddle but only skills and techniques to manoeuvre the sail. The Subiran Regatta is now on its 32nd year and counting. This contest is done annually on that weeklong celebration of the Tacloban City Fiesta. The race aims to preserve the art of sailing with the wind alone, and to showcase the mastery of this art by local boatmen.\n\n;Balyuan: Organized by the Department of Tourism and the city government, this activity which only started in 1975 is supposedly a re-enactment of a purported exchange of images between Barrio Buscada of [[Basey, Samar|Basey]] and Sitio Kankabatok, now Tacloban City.  A local story which only saw print in the 20th century purports that in the old days, Sitio Kankabatok was a small barrio under the jurisdiction of Basey town in Samar. During the Feast of Santo Ni\u00f1o, the residents of Sitio Kankabatok would borrow the bigger image of the saint from the chapel of Barrio Buscada in Basey. Santo Ni\u00f1o is the revered patron saint of both Kankabatok and Barrio Buscada. The image is returned promptly after the festivities. When Kankabatok grew into a barrio of its own, the local Catholic authorities decided that the bigger Santo Ni\u00f1o image be retained in prospering village. However, because of its highly questionable anthropological and historical basis, the story can be best understood as simply etiological.  It gives witness to the cultural, ethnographical and historical relationship between the people of south Samar and the eastern seaboard of Leyte.  Likewise, stories of the image missing in Buscada and turning up in Kankabatok aided to this decision of honoring this relationship. The Basey Flotilla bearing the church and government leaders goes on a fluvial procession along San Pedro Bay. A budyong (shell) call announces the sight of the flotilla off Kankabatok Bay.\n\n;Sangyaw Festival: [[Sangyaw]] is an archaic Waray word which means to herald the news. The Sangyaw Festival was created by [[Imelda Marcos]] in the 1980s. The festival was revived in 2008 by her nephew, current city mayor Alfred Romualdez. The Sangyaw Festival invites contingents of different performing groups of various festivals in the country to compete in this side of the region. Cash prizes and trophies are at stake as the Sangyaw Festival grooms itself to be a big festival to watch out in the succeeding years.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{stack|float=right\n|[[File:San Juanico Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The San Juanico Bridge, north of the city]]\n|[[File:Sto.
