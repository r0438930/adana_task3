The United States '''Naval Photographic Science Laboratory''' (NPSL) was opened in the midst of the Second World War, on 24 Feb 1943, at the [[Anacostia]] [[Naval Air Station]], [[Washington, D. C.]].  It was established under the military command of the Chief of the Navy's [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] with the mission of centralizing the production and preservation of all naval related photography operations.

==History==
During its four years of operation, the NPSL provided photographic services to the [[United States Navy|Navy]], including the conducting of research to develop new photographic equipment and techniques in the areas of motion picture production, still photography, aerial photography, graphic arts and photolithography. It was responsible for providing secret and confidential services at the Anacostia facilities for [[Photographic printing|printing]] and [[Photographic processing|developing films]] in quantity and for the training of [[motion picture]] [[camera operators]]. It was the Navy's sole wartime unit for the production of [[training film]]s, and ultimately expsnded its operations to provide production services for any military or governmental activity during the last two years of the war. The NPSL also served as a storehouse for copies of motion pictures and still photographs sent to the laboratory from war-time fleet and air base operations. 

In 1947, while maintaining its operations base at Anacostia, the NPSL was renamed the United States Naval Photographic Center (NPC).

'''Fintel''' is a municipality in the [[Rotenburg (district)|district of Rotenburg]], in [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]] and has about 3,000 inhabitants. It is located on the rivers [[Fintau]] and Ruschwede.

== History ==
Fintel belonged to the [[Bishopric of Verden|Prince-Bishopric of Verden]], established in 1180. In 1648 the Prince-Bishopric was transformed into the [[Principality of Verden]], which was first ruled in [[personal union]] by the Swedish Crown - interrupted by a Danish occupation (1712–1715) - and from 1715 on by the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] Crown. In 1807 the ephemeric [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] annexed the Principality, before [[First French Empire|France]] annexed it in 1810. In 1813 the Principality was restored to the [[Electorate of Hanover]], which - after its upgrade to the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] in 1814 - incorporated the Principality in a [[real union]] and the Princely territory, including Fintel, became part of the new [[Stade (region)|Stade Region]], established in 1823.

== Politics ==
Fintel is part of the ''[[Samtgemeinde]]'' (\"collective municipality\") [[Fintel (Samtgemeinde)|Fintel]], population about 7,000.
