They are commonly employed in energy and construction companies.<ref name=\"Sadovskaya2007\" /> Some Chinese who have officially entered the country on short-term business visas for the purpose of trade are also in reality employed as labourers by Chinese companies.<ref name=\"Sadovskaya2007b\">{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2007|p=157}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2000s, independent entrepreneurs running import-export businesses, as well as larger investors, began to become more active.<ref>{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2007|p=155}}</ref> Most of the products which Chinese traders sell are purchased in the special economic zones in the Xinjiang border regions.<ref>{{harvnb|Parham|2004|p=90}}</ref> Over 4,000 Chinese firms or Kazakhstani firms with some Chinese investors are officially registered with the government; however, {{asof|2006|lc=on}}, only 213 were active.<ref>{{harvnb|Syroezhkin|2009|p=43}}</ref>\n\nThere is a Chinese bazaar in Almaty, the Barakholka Bazaar, which in addition to selling general Chinese-made products such as electronics or foodstuffs to local people, also sells products aimed at Chinese people such as Chinese pop music or Chinese-language newspapers. These are not in evidence in other urban areas.<ref>{{harvnb|Parham|2004|pp=79\u201380}}</ref> It came to be dominated by Uyghur and Dungan traders in the 1990s; it is actually located near the site of a former Dungan ''kolkhoz''<ref>{{harvnb|Laruelle|Peyrouse|2009|p=98}}</ref> and the areas of traditional Uyghur settlement in Almaty - ''Zarya Vostoka'' village <ref name=\"Sadovskaya2016d\">{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2016|p=64}}</ref>\n\nThe Dungan have often played an intermediary role in business ventures between migrants from China and local people.<ref>{{harvnb|Laruelle|Peyrouse|2009|p=110}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\nA Xinjiang-based [[free newspaper]] aimed at Chinese people in Kazakhstan, the ''H\u0101s\u00e0k\u00e8s\u012bt\u01cen Hu\u00e1qi\u00e1o B\u00e0o'' (\u54c8\u8428\u514b\u65af\u5766\u534e\u4fa8\u62a5, literally \"Kazakhstan Chinese Emigrant Newspaper\"), received permission from the Kazakhstan government in April 2009 to begin publication. The editors plan to publish it bilingually in both Russian and Chinese, with two issues of eight pages each per month. It is printed by the same department responsible for the ''[[Xinjiang Economic Daily]]''.<ref name=\"Xinhua\"/>\n\n==Ethnic Kazakhs among the migrants==\n{{main|Oralman}}\nThe Kazakh government has sought to promote permanent relocation of ethnic Kazakhs from abroad in Kazakhstan by providing them with financial assistance and land grants in border areas <ref name=\"Sadovskaya2016e\">{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2016|p=52-56}}</ref>. However, this eventually requires them to give up their Chinese nationality and right of residence; according to Xinjiang media, many later come to regret this move <ref name=\"Parham2004a\">{{harvnb|Parham|2004|p=93}}</ref>. They experience difficulty in integration because they are more used to the Arabic orthography for the Kazakh language rather than the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] one used in Kazakhstan, and speak only Chinese and very rarely Russian as a second language, if any at all <ref name=\"Sadovskaya2007a\" /><ref name=\"Parham2004b\">{{harvnb|Parham|2004|p=94}}</ref>.

In 2012 this share with indifferent attitudes shrunk up to 44%, and the share of those with \u201cpoor\u201d attitudes increased from 15 to 33%; respondents with positive attitudes accounted for 23% (26% in 2007) <ref>{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2016|p=84-85}}</ref>.\n\nThere is even some opposition to the presence or further migration of Uyghurs or Kazakhs from Xinjiang, because of the perception that their presence may draw more Chinese influence into the country as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Parham|2004|p=81}}</ref> A 2009 proposal by the Chinese government to lease one million hectares of steppe for cultivation of [[soybean]]s sparked a series of protests in Almaty in December and January over the possibility that Chinese labourers would be brought to the country to work the land.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Prospect_Of_Chinese_Farmers_Brings_Controversy_To_Kazakh_Soil/1906896.html|last=Pannier|first=Bruce|date=2009-12-17|accessdate=2010-01-03|title=Prospect of Chinese Farmers Brings Controversy to Kazakh Soil|periodical=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8489024.stm|periodical=BBC News|date=2010-01-31|accessdate=2010-02-01|title=Kazakhs protest against China farmland lease|first=Rayhan|last=Demytrie}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2012 sociological survey, higher tolerance to Chinese migrants is observed among ethnic minorities and Russians, those aged 18-29 and 30-39, and respondents with higher educational levels <ref name=\"Sadovskaya2016f\">{{harvnb|Sadovskaya|2016|p=86}}</ref>.
