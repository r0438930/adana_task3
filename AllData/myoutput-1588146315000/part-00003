It also noted that the battery pack holds only about 10% of the energy contained in a gasoline tank and is spread across 16 firewalled modules, meaning that the combustion potential is only about 1% as much.

The statement said that a curved piece of metal from a [[semi-trailer]] that had fallen on the roadway appeared to have impaled the {{convert|1/4|in|mm|spell=in|adj=on}} plate on the base of the vehicle. According to the statement, in order for the object to have made a {{convert|3|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter hole in the plate, the object must have had enough [[Mechanical advantage|leverage]] to produce approximately {{convert|25|-STf|kN|sp=us}}. After the driver exited the car, the statement continued, the frontmost of the car's 16 battery modules caught fire due to the initial damage, but the battery pack's internal firewalls kept the fire from spreading and vents directed the flames away from the car down towards the pavement. The statement also noted that the fire never entered the passenger compartment. According to Tesla, the firefighters observed standard procedure, and gained access to the source of the fire by puncturing holes in the top of the battery's protective metal plate and applying water. However, the company noted that although the water and dry-chemical fire extinguisher quickly put out the fire, the firefighters should not have punctured the firewall since the new holes allowed flames to enter the front trunk of the vehicle.<ref name=ModelSfire03/> Musk closed the official statement explaining that the result of this accident could have been \"far worse\" had a conventional gasoline-powered car encountered the same object on the highway, because most gasoline cars do not have an armored underbody, leaving the fuel lines and tank vulnerable. He also noted that Tesla's battery pack only contains about 10% as much energy as a standard tank of gasoline and it is divided into 16 sections means that the combustion potential is about 1% of a comparable gasoline-powered car. Based on U.S. statistics from the [[National Fire Protection Association]], Musk's statement claimed that a fire was five times more likely in a gasoline car than in a Tesla car.<ref name=ModelSfire03/>\n\nThe U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) was not able to send investigators to the scene of the incident due to the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|U.S federal government shutdown]].<ref name=ModelSfire02>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/business/car-fire-a-test-for-high-flying-tesla.html?ref=automobiles&_r=0|title=Car Fire a Test for High-Flying Tesla|author=Bill Vlasic|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2013-10-03|accessdate=2013-10-05}} The video is available at [[YouTube]], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0kjI08n4fg here].</ref> After the agency reopened, the NHTSA began gathering data of the incident.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131022/AUTO01/310220090/1148/rss25|title=NHTSA looking into Tesla EV fire|author=David Shepardson|work=[[The Detroit News]]|date=2013-10-22|accessdate=2013-10-23|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023113709/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131022/AUTO01/310220090/1148/rss25|archivedate=2013-10-23}}</ref> On 24 October 2013, the agency announced it will not open a formal investigation into the Model S fire incident, saying that they had not found evidence that the fire was caused by a vehicle defect or noncompliance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131024/AUTO01/310240137/1121/auto0102/U.S.-will-not-open-investigation-into-Tesla-fire|title=U.S. will not open investigation into Tesla fire|author=David Shepardson|work=The Detroit News|date=2013-10-24|accessdate=2013-10-25}}</ref>\n\nA second reported fire occurred on October 18, 2013 in [[Merida, Mexico]].

It also noted that the battery pack holds only about 10% of the energy contained in a gasoline tank and is spread across 16 firewalled modules, meaning that the combustion potential is only about 1% as much.

The statement said that a curved piece of metal from a [[semi-trailer]] that had fallen on the roadway appeared to have impaled the {{convert|1/4|in|mm|spell=in|adj=on}} plate on the base of the vehicle. According to the statement, in order for the object to have made a {{convert|3|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter hole in the plate, the object must have had enough [[Mechanical advantage|leverage]] to produce approximately {{convert|25|-STf|kN|sp=us}}. After the driver exited the car, the statement continued, the frontmost of the car's 16 battery modules caught fire due to the initial damage, but the battery pack's internal firewalls kept the fire from spreading and vents directed the flames away from the car down towards the pavement. The statement also noted that the fire never entered the passenger compartment. According to Tesla, the firefighters observed standard procedure, and gained access to the source of the fire by puncturing holes in the top of the battery's protective metal plate and applying water. However, the company noted that although the water and dry-chemical fire extinguisher quickly put out the fire, the firefighters should not have punctured the firewall since the new holes allowed flames to enter the front trunk of the vehicle.<ref name=ModelSfire03/> Musk closed the official statement explaining that the result of this accident could have been \"far worse\" had a conventional gasoline-powered car encountered the same object on the highway, because most gasoline cars do not have an armored underbody, leaving the fuel lines and tank vulnerable. He also noted that Tesla's battery pack only contains about 10% as much energy as a standard tank of gasoline and it is divided into 16 sections means that the combustion potential is about 1% of a comparable gasoline-powered car. Based on U.S. statistics from the [[National Fire Protection Association]], Musk's statement claimed that a fire was five times more likely in a gasoline car than in a Tesla car.<ref name=ModelSfire03/>\n\nThe U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) was not able to send investigators to the scene of the incident due to the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|U.S federal government shutdown]].<ref name=ModelSfire02>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/business/car-fire-a-test-for-high-flying-tesla.html?ref=automobiles&_r=0|title=Car Fire a Test for High-Flying Tesla|author=Bill Vlasic|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2013-10-03|accessdate=2013-10-05}} The video is available at [[YouTube]], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0kjI08n4fg here].</ref> After the agency reopened, the NHTSA began gathering data of the incident.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131022/AUTO01/310220090/1148/rss25|title=NHTSA looking into Tesla EV fire|author=David Shepardson|work=[[The Detroit News]]|date=2013-10-22|accessdate=2013-10-23|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023113709/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131022/AUTO01/310220090/1148/rss25|archivedate=2013-10-23}}</ref> On 24 October 2013, the agency announced it will not open a formal investigation into the Model S fire incident, saying that they had not found evidence that the fire was caused by a vehicle defect or noncompliance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131024/AUTO01/310240137/1121/auto0102/U.S.-will-not-open-investigation-into-Tesla-fire|title=U.S. will not open investigation into Tesla fire|author=David Shepardson|work=The Detroit News|date=2013-10-24|accessdate=2013-10-25}}</ref>\n\nA second reported fire occurred on October 18, 2013 in [[Merida, Mexico]].
