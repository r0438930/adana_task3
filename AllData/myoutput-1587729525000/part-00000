From then on the lower section of the track, including the historic [[Knapsack Viaduct|Knapsack Gully Viaduct]], was converted into a road, the Great Western Highway, the main road up the Lapstone hill until the M4 motorway replaced it in 1993.<ref name=\"knpasack\">{{cite web|author=Martin, David |url=http://infobluemountains.net.au/rail/lower/lapstone.htm |title=Lapstone Hill Railway Routes: Blue Mountains, Australia |work=Infobluemountains.net.au |date=28 February 2010 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> The older tunnel was converted for mushroom growing but was also used by the [[RAAF]] for storage during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"tunnel\">{{cite web|author=Martin, David |url=http://infobluemountains.net.au/rail/lower/glen-tunnel-old.htm |title=Glenbrook's old Railway Tunnel: Blue Mountains Railway Pages |work=Infobluemountains.net.au |date=9 December 1912 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> During 1943 to 1946 Glenbrook tunnel stored chemical weapons.<ref>[http://www.mustardgas.org/depots.htm]</ref> Today the Zig Zag, Knapsack Viaduct, The Old Glenbook Tunnel, and Lucasville station can all be accessed by walking tracks.\n\n== Knapsack Viaduct, 1863-65 ==\nThe Knapsack Viaduct was designed by and built by [[John Whitton]]. Its purpose was to carry the Railway Line across Knapsack Gully. It formed part of the Zig Zag, which climbed the eastern escarpment from Emu Plains to today's Glenbrook. Whitton also designed and built The Victoria Bridge across the Nepean River at Penrith. \n[[File:Knapsack Viaduct, Lapstone (2886372648).jpg|thumb|View From Emu Plains, New South Wales]]\nConstruction of the Knapsack Gully Viaduct started in March 1863 by contractor W. Watkins, who also completed the stone piers of the Victoria Bridge at Penrith. Work was completed in 1865, with the bridge being constructed from local sandstone quarried in the neighbourhood around [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]], and carried a single rail line.\n\nThe viaduct fell into disuse in 1913 after the completion of the Glenbrook Gorge Deviation. In 1926, after over a decade of disuse, the Knapsack Viaduct was taken over by the Main Roads Board. The board sought to improve the route of the Great Western Highway between [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]] and [[Blaxland, New South Wales|Blaxland]], that at the time zig zagged up what is today Old Bathurst Road. The viaduct's carriageway was widened to allow for two car lanes, by trimming back the inside face of the stone parapets. The new road was opened by Governor Sir Dudley DeChair on 23 October 1926. The viaduct was again widened in 1939, with the construction of a reinforced concrete cantilevered deck, because of increased traffic use.\n\nThe final deviation of the [[Great Western Highway]], with the opening of the [[M4 (Sydney)#M4 Western Motorway|M4 Western Motorway]] in 1993, ended traffic flow across the Knapsack Viaduct. In 1995 the Viaduct was reopened to the public as part of the historic Lapstone Zig Zag walk.<ref>{{Cite NSW HD|4301012|Knapsack Viaduct, Lapstone|date=|access-date=2018-06-02}}</ref>\n\n== Present day ==\nThe line of the old track and cuttings (including the long abandoned platform of Lucasville station), and the old Knapsack Gully bridge is now a popular [[bushwalking]] track.<ref name=\"walks1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwalks.com/bushwalking-and-hiking-in-nsw/glenbrook-eastern-blue-mountains/lapstone-bridge-zigzig-walk.html |title=Wildwalks |location=AU-NS |publisher=Wildwalks |date= |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> Often a cacophony of [[Bird vocalization|birdsong]] and insects can be heard where the gully is deep at the viaduct and it would tend to echo these sounds, especially that of the [[bell miner]].

The Lapstone ZigZag and [[Lucasville railway station|Lucasville station]] were officially closed on 18 December 1892 and the rails were raised, after the completion of the Glenbrook Tunnel Deviation.<ref name=\"environment.nsw.gov.au\"/> The Deviation soon experienced problems as it was built at the same too steep grade as the Zig Zag which caused the locomotives to slip in the tunnel, mostly due to water leaking onto the tunnel floor from nearby creek, and smoke also became a problem for uphill trains, as the tunnel was not designed to vent the smoke.<ref name=\"Low\" /> \n\nThe building of the tunnel is the subject of [[Arthur Streeton|Arthur Streeton's]] famous painting ''Fire's On''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistsfootsteps.com/html/Streeton_fireson.htm |title=Artist's Footsteps |publisher=Artistsfootsteps.com |date= |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nBy 1910, the line as a whole was being duplicated (made into [[double track]]) and the \"rathole\" tunnel was replaced on a different deviation with a gentler alignment with 1 in 60 (1.67%) grades and the New [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] tunnel at Bluffs point on the Glenbrook Creek escartment. From then on the lower section of the track, including the historic [[Knapsack Viaduct|Knapsack Gully Viaduct]], was converted into a road, the Great Western Highway, the main road up the Lapstone hill until the M4 motorway replaced it in 1993.<ref name=\"knpasack\">{{cite web|author=Martin, David |url=http://infobluemountains.net.au/rail/lower/lapstone.htm |title=Lapstone Hill Railway Routes: Blue Mountains, Australia |work=Infobluemountains.net.au |date=28 February 2010 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> The older tunnel was converted for mushroom growing but was also used by the [[RAAF]] for storage during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"tunnel\">{{cite web|author=Martin, David |url=http://infobluemountains.net.au/rail/lower/glen-tunnel-old.htm |title=Glenbrook's old Railway Tunnel: Blue Mountains Railway Pages |work=Infobluemountains.net.au |date=9 December 1912 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> During 1943 to 1946 Glenbrook tunnel stored chemical weapons.<ref>[http://www.mustardgas.org/depots.htm]</ref> Today the Zig Zag, Knapsack Viaduct, The Old Glenbook Tunnel, and Lucasville station can all be accessed by walking tracks.\n\n== Knapsack Viaduct, 1863-65 ==\nThe Knapsack Viaduct was designed by and built by [[John Whitton]]. Its purpose was to carry the Railway Line across Knapsack Gully. It formed part of the Zig Zag, which climbed the eastern escarpment from Emu Plains to today's Glenbrook. Whitton also designed and built The Victoria Bridge across the Nepean River at Penrith. \n[[File:Knapsack Viaduct, Lapstone (2886372648).jpg|thumb|View From Emu Plains, New South Wales]]\nConstruction of the Knapsack Gully Viaduct started in March 1863 by contractor W. Watkins, who also completed the stone piers of the Victoria Bridge at Penrith. Work was completed in 1865, with the bridge being constructed from local sandstone quarried in the neighbourhood around [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]], and carried a single rail line.\n\nThe viaduct fell into disuse in 1913 after the completion of the Glenbrook Gorge Deviation. In 1926, after over a decade of disuse, the Knapsack Viaduct was taken over by the Main Roads Board. The board sought to improve the route of the Great Western Highway between [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]] and [[Blaxland, New South Wales|Blaxland]], that at the time zig zagged up what is today Old Bathurst Road. The viaduct's carriageway was widened to allow for two car lanes, by trimming back the inside face of the stone parapets. The new road was opened by Governor Sir Dudley DeChair on 23 October 1926. The viaduct was again widened in 1939, with the construction of a reinforced concrete cantilevered deck, because of increased traffic use.\n\nThe final deviation of the [[Great Western Highway]], with the opening of the [[M4 (Sydney)#M4 Western Motorway|M4 Western Motorway]] in 1993, ended traffic flow across the Knapsack Viaduct. In 1995 the Viaduct was reopened to the public as part of the historic Lapstone Zig Zag walk.<ref>{{Cite NSW HD|4301012|Knapsack Viaduct, Lapstone|date=|access-date=2018-06-02}}</ref>\n\n== Present day ==\nThe line of the old track and cuttings (including the long abandoned platform of Lucasville station), and the old Knapsack Gully bridge is now a popular [[bushwalking]] track.<ref name=\"walks1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwalks.com/bushwalking-and-hiking-in-nsw/glenbrook-eastern-blue-mountains/lapstone-bridge-zigzig-walk.html |title=Wildwalks |location=AU-NS |publisher=Wildwalks |date= |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> Often a cacophony of [[Bird vocalization|birdsong]] and insects can be heard where the gully is deep at the viaduct and it would tend to echo these sounds, especially that of the [[bell miner]].
