He played for the [[New York Mets]], [[Baltimore Orioles]], [[Colorado Rockies]] and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]].\n\nFrom his debut in 1999 to 2003, Melvin Mora was known as a [[utility player]], playing all three outfield positions, shortstop, and second base. In 2004, the Orioles made Mora their everyday third baseman, a position he occupied through 2009.\n\n==Career==\n\n===New York Mets===\nMora was signed out of Venezuela in 1991. After spending seven years in the [[Houston Astros|Astros]] [[Minor League Baseball|minors]] system and couple of months in [[CPBL]]'s [[Mercuries Tigers]], he signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[New York Mets|Mets]] in [[1998 Major League Baseball season|1998]] and made his major league debut in the [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999 season]]. Mora made himself more valuable by being able to play all three [[outfield]] positions, [[shortstop]], [[second base]] and [[third base|third]].\n\n[[File:Melvin Mora (1999) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Mora with the [[New York Mets]] in 1999]]\nIn 1999, he scored the winning run of the final game of the year for the Mets on a wild pitch by the Pirates' [[Brad Clontz]], which propelled the [[1999 New York Mets season|Mets]] to a one-game playoff with [[1999 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]], which they won.\n\n===Baltimore Orioles===\n\n====2000&ndash;02====\nMelvin Mora was traded by the Mets to Baltimore on July 28, 2000, with two minor league players and [[Mike Kinkade]] for shortstop [[Mike Bordick]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/M/Pmoram002.htm|title=Melvin Mora|accessdate=2009-06-23 |publisher=[[Retrosheet]]}}</ref>\n\nUsed as a utility player in Baltimore, Mora showed promise and hints of ability to contribute as an everyday player but struggled to break through. Things changed when an injury-depleted Orioles team used Mora almost exclusively in left field, and Mora responded with the best stretch of his career. He reached base in 32 straight games while using a 23-game hitting streak to temporarily become the [[American League]] batting leader. Finally excelling as a hitter, Mora was chosen for his first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] selection. Mora's season was cut short due to injuries (a bruised wrist and a partially torn ligament in his left knee), but finished with a .317 batting average, 15 home runs, and a .418 [[on-base percentage]] in 96 games.\n\n====2003&ndash;04====\nMora's 2003 season proved that he could be a consistent hitter at the major league level. In 2004, Mora became the Orioles' regular third baseman and enjoyed his most productive season in the majors. Mora hit a career-high .340, finishing second in the [[American League|AL]] batting race to [[Ichiro Suzuki]]'s .372 mark; led the league in on-base percentage (.419); ranked 5th in [[slugging average]] (.562) and [[On-base plus slugging|OPS]] (.981); 6th in [[Run (baseball)|runs]] (111), [[Double (baseball)|doubles]] (41) and [[times on base]] (264); 8th in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] (187), and 9th in [[total bases]] (264). His 27 home runs and 104 RBI were also career-highs, while leading his team in batting average, runs, on-base percentage, slugging average and OPS. At third base, he improved and became more consistent as the season wore on. Mora finished 18th in [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|American League MVP]] voting and won a [[Silver Slugger Award]].\n\n====2005&ndash;07====\n[[File:Melvin Mora Baltimore Orioles.jpg|thumb|Melvin Mora, during a break in the action, playing for Baltimore Orioles in 2006.]]\nIn 2005, Mora once again hit 27 home runs, although his [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] and on-base percentage dropped. On May 19, 2006 Mora agreed to a three-year, $25M deal that included a no-trade clause because Mora did not want to move his family to another city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2451156 |title=Mora signs three-year, $25M extension with Orioles |accessdate=2009-06-23|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=2006-05-19 |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Mora's home run total dropped to 16, and again dropped in 2007 to 14. Mora also saw his batting average fall to .274 for both seasons.\n\n====2008====\nMora was named American League Player of the Month for August 2008. Mora batted .418 (41-for-98) with 8 home runs and had an MLB leading 32 RBIs in 24 games. He posted a .765 slugging percentage and a .455 on-base percentage, with 17 extra-base hits, including eight doubles. Mora had a 13 multi-hit games in August 2008 and maintained an 8-game hitting streak from August 1\u201310. On August 17 at [[Comerica Park|Detroit]], Mora went 5-for-6 with two doubles, 2 home runs, 4 runs scored and 6 RBIs during a 16&ndash;8 Orioles win. Overall, Mora had five games in August in which he collected four-or-more RBIs. Mora injured his [[hamstring]] on August 29, 2008, missing the final games of his impressive month.\n\n====2009====\nOn September 18, 2009, [[Brooks Robinson]] made a rare appearance at Camden Yards to honor Mora for moving into second all-time in games played at third base by an Oriole (behind only the Hall of Famer Brooks, himself).
