He [[nationalization|nationalized]] strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full [[external debt]] and achieved nearly [[full employment]]. The economy, however, began to decline in 1950 because of over-expenditure. His highly popular wife, [[Eva Per\u00f3n]], played a central political role. She pushed Congress to enact [[women's suffrage]] in 1947,{{sfn|Barnes|1978|p=3}} and developed an unprecedented social assistance to the most vulnerable sectors of society.{{sfn|Barnes|1978|pp=113ff}} However, her declining health did not allow her to run for the vice-presidency in 1951, and she died of cancer the following year. Per\u00f3n [[Argentine general election, 1951|was reelected in 1951]], surpassing even his 1946 performance. In 1955 the Navy [[bombing of Plaza de Mayo|bombed the Plaza de Mayo]] in an ill-fated attempt to kill the President. A few months later, during the self-called [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora|Liberating Revolution]] coup, he resigned and went into [[exile]] in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

Trade unionists were targeted for assassination by the Peronist and Marxist paramilitaries as early as 1969, and individual cases of [[state-sponsored terrorism]] against Peronism and the left can be traced back to the [[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo]] in 1955. The [[Trelew massacre]] of 1972, the actions of the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] since 1973, and [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n]]'s \"annihilation decrees\" against left-wing guerrillas during ''[[Operativo Independencia]]'' (translates to Operation of Independence) in 1975, have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the Dirty War.\n\nOngan\u00eda shut down Congress, banned all political parties and dismantled student and worker unions. In 1969, popular discontent led to two massive protests: the ''[[Cordobazo]]'' and the ''[[Rosariazo]]''. The terrorist guerrilla organization [[Montoneros]] kidnapped and executed Aramburu.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=127}} The newly chosen head of government, [[Alejandro Agust\u00edn Lanusse]], seeking to ease the growing political pressure, let [[H\u00e9ctor Jos\u00e9 C\u00e1mpora]] be the Peronist candidate instead of Per\u00f3n. C\u00e1mpora won the [[Argentine general election, March 1973|March 1973 election]], issued a [[amnesty|pardon]] for condemned guerrilla members and then secured Per\u00f3n's return from his exile in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=423\u201365}}\n\nOn the day Per\u00f3n returned to Argentina, the clash between Peronist internal factions\u2014[[right-wing]] union leaders and [[left-wing]] youth from Montoneros\u2014resulted in the [[Ezeiza Massacre]]. C\u00e1mpora resigned, overwhelmed by political violence, and Per\u00f3n won the [[Argentine general election, September 1973|September 1973 election]] with his third wife [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n|Isabel]] as vice-president. He [[expulsion of Montoneros from Plaza de Mayo|expelled Montoneros from the party]]{{sfn|Robben|2011|pp=76\u201377}} and they became once again a clandestine organization. [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rega]] organized the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] (AAA) to fight against them and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP).\nPer\u00f3n died in July 1974 and was succeeded by his wife, who signed a secret decree empowering the military and the police to \"annihilate\" the left-wing subversion,{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=145}} [[Operation Independence|stopping ERP's attempt]] to start a rural insurgence in Tucum\u00e1n province.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=148}} [[March 1976 coup|Isabel Per\u00f3n was ousted]] one year later by a junta of the three armed forces, led by army general [[Jorge Rafael Videla]].

By the end of 1976 Montoneros had lost near 2,000 members; by 1977, the ERP was completely defeated. A severely weakened Montoneros launched a counterattack in 1979, which was quickly annihilated, ending the guerrilla threat. Nevertheless, the junta stayed in power.\n\nIn 1982, the then head of state, General [[Leopoldo Galtieri]], authorised the invasion of the British territories of South Georgia and, on 2 April, of the [[Operation Rosario|Falkland Islands]].

The western pampas receive less rainfall, this ''dry pampa'' is a plain of short grasses or [[steppe]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe [[National Parks of Argentina]] make up a network of 35 [[national park]]s in Argentina.

In this stage, in 1786, a tragedy entitled ''Siripo'' had its premiere. ''Siripo'' is now a lost work (only the second act is conserved), and can be considered the first Argentine stage play, because it was written by Buenos Aires poet Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Lavard\u00e9n, it was premiered in Buenos Aires, and its plot was inspired by an historical episode of the early colonization of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]]: the destruction of [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Sancti Spiritu]] colony by aboriginals in 1529. ''La Rancher\u00eda'' theatre operated until its destruction in a fire in 1792. The second theatre stage in Buenos Aires was [[Teatro Coliseo]], opened in 1804 during the term of Viceroy [[Rafael de Sobremonte]]. It was the nation's longest-continuously operating stage. The musical creator of the Argentine National Anthem, [[Blas Parera]], earned fame as a theatre score writer during the early 19th century. The genre suffered during the regime of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], though it flourished alongside the economy later in the century. The national government gave Argentine theatre its initial impulse with the establishment of the [[Col\u00f3n Theatre]], in 1857, which hosted classical and operatic, as well as stage performances. Antonio Petalardo's successful 1871 gambit on the opening of the [[Teatro Opera]], inspired others to fund the growing art in Argentina.\n\n===Cinema===\n{{main|Cinema of Argentina}}\nThe Argentine film industry has historically been one of the three most developed in [[Latin American cinema]], along with those produced in [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Cinema of Brazil|Brazil]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Carl J.|last=Mora|title=Mexican Cinema: Reflections of a Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOwdFIQiTv8C&pg=PA196|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04304-6|page=196}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.argentina.ar/_es/cultura/cine/index.php |title=Argentina \u2013 Cultura \u2013 Cine |language=Spanish |date=16 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216141530/http://www.argentina.ar/_es/cultura/cine/index.php |archivedate=16 December 2008}}</ref> Started in 1896; by the early 1930s it had already become Latin America's leading film producer, a place it kept until the early 1950s.{{sfn|King|2000|p=36}} The world's first [[list of animated feature films|animated feature films]] were made and released in Argentina, by cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]], in 1917 and 1918.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.4/articles/bendazzi1.4.html|title=Quirino Cristiani, The Untold Story of Argentina's Pioneer Animator|first=Giannalberto|last=Bendazzi|publisher=Animation World Network|year=1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928121624/http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.4/articles/bendazzi1.4.html|archivedate=28 September 2013|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|caption_align=center\n|image1=Andr\u00e9s Muschietti.jpg|caption1=[[Andy Muschietti]], director of ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'', the highest-grossing horror film of all-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/stephen-king-it-the-exorcist-highest-grossing-horror-film-ever|title=Stephen King's It scares off The Exorcist to become highest-grossing horror ever|last=Mumford|first=Gwilym|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 29, 2017|accessdate=October 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114000256/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/stephen-king-it-the-exorcist-highest-grossing-horror-film-ever|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-it-movie-horror-record-despicable-me-3-kingsman-never-say-die-weekend-results-international-box-office-1202184382/|title='Blade Runner 2049' Launches With $50M Overseas; 'It' Tops $600M WW; 'Despicable 3' Hops Past 'Zootopia' \u2013 Intl Box Office|accessdate=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008205909/http://deadline.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-it-movie-horror-record-despicable-me-3-kingsman-never-say-die-weekend-results-international-box-office-1202184382/|archive-date=8 October 2017|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|image2=Marcelo Pont Verg\u00e9s.jpg|caption2=The art director of ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' won the [[Academy Award]] for that film.\n}}\n\nArgentine films have achieved worldwide recognition: the country has won two [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]], for ''[[The Official Story]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (2009), from seven nominations:\n* ''[[The Truce (1974 film)|The Truce]]'' (''La tregua'') in 1974\n* ''[[Camila (film)|Camila]]'' in 1984\n* ''[[The Official Story]]'' (''La historia oficial'') in 1985\n* ''[[Tango (1998 film)|Tango]]'' in 1998\n* ''[[Son of the Bride]]'' (''El hijo de la novia'') in 2001\n* ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (''El secreto de sus ojos'') in 2009\n* ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]'' (''Relatos salvajes'') in 2015\n\nIn addition, Argentine composers [[Luis Enrique Bacalov]] and [[Gustavo Santaolalla]] have been honored with [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Awards for Best Original Score]], and [[Armando B\u00f3 (screenwriter)|Armando B\u00f3]] and [[Nicol\u00e1s Giacobone]] shared in the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] for 2014.

He [[nationalization|nationalized]] strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full [[external debt]] and achieved nearly [[full employment]]. The economy, however, began to decline in 1950 because of over-expenditure. His highly popular wife, [[Eva Per\u00f3n]], played a central political role. She pushed Congress to enact [[women's suffrage]] in 1947,{{sfn|Barnes|1978|p=3}} and developed an unprecedented social assistance to the most vulnerable sectors of society.{{sfn|Barnes|1978|pp=113ff}} However, her declining health did not allow her to run for the vice-presidency in 1951, and she died of cancer the following year. Per\u00f3n [[Argentine general election, 1951|was reelected in 1951]], surpassing even his 1946 performance. In 1955 the Navy [[bombing of Plaza de Mayo|bombed the Plaza de Mayo]] in an ill-fated attempt to kill the President. A few months later, during the self-called [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora|Liberating Revolution]] coup, he resigned and went into [[exile]] in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

Trade unionists were targeted for assassination by the Peronist and Marxist paramilitaries as early as 1969, and individual cases of [[state-sponsored terrorism]] against Peronism and the left can be traced back to the [[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo]] in 1955. The [[Trelew massacre]] of 1972, the actions of the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] since 1973, and [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n]]'s \"annihilation decrees\" against left-wing guerrillas during ''[[Operativo Independencia]]'' (translates to Operation of Independence) in 1975, have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the Dirty War.\n\nOngan\u00eda shut down Congress, banned all political parties and dismantled student and worker unions. In 1969, popular discontent led to two massive protests: the ''[[Cordobazo]]'' and the ''[[Rosariazo]]''. The terrorist guerrilla organization [[Montoneros]] kidnapped and executed Aramburu.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=127}} The newly chosen head of government, [[Alejandro Agust\u00edn Lanusse]], seeking to ease the growing political pressure, let [[H\u00e9ctor Jos\u00e9 C\u00e1mpora]] be the Peronist candidate instead of Per\u00f3n. C\u00e1mpora won the [[Argentine general election, March 1973|March 1973 election]], issued a [[amnesty|pardon]] for condemned guerrilla members and then secured Per\u00f3n's return from his exile in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=423\u201365}}\n\nOn the day Per\u00f3n returned to Argentina, the clash between Peronist internal factions\u2014[[right-wing]] union leaders and [[left-wing]] youth from Montoneros\u2014resulted in the [[Ezeiza Massacre]]. C\u00e1mpora resigned, overwhelmed by political violence, and Per\u00f3n won the [[Argentine general election, September 1973|September 1973 election]] with his third wife [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n|Isabel]] as vice-president. He [[expulsion of Montoneros from Plaza de Mayo|expelled Montoneros from the party]]{{sfn|Robben|2011|pp=76\u201377}} and they became once again a clandestine organization. [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rega]] organized the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] (AAA) to fight against them and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP).\nPer\u00f3n died in July 1974 and was succeeded by his wife, who signed a secret decree empowering the military and the police to \"annihilate\" the left-wing subversion,{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=145}} [[Operation Independence|stopping ERP's attempt]] to start a rural insurgence in Tucum\u00e1n province.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=148}} [[March 1976 coup|Isabel Per\u00f3n was ousted]] one year later by a junta of the three armed forces, led by army general [[Jorge Rafael Videla]]. They initiated the [[National Reorganization Process]], often shortened to ''Proceso''.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

By the end of 1976 Montoneros had lost near 2,000 members; by 1977, the ERP was completely defeated. A severely weakened Montoneros launched a counterattack in 1979, which was quickly annihilated, ending the guerrilla threat. Nevertheless, the junta stayed in power.\n\nIn 1982, the then head of state, General [[Leopoldo Galtieri]], authorised the invasion of the British territories of South Georgia and, on 2 April, of the [[Operation Rosario|Falkland Islands]].

In this stage, in 1786, a tragedy entitled ''Siripo'' had its premiere. ''Siripo'' is now a lost work (only the second act is conserved), and can be considered the first Argentine stage play, because it was written by Buenos Aires poet Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Lavard\u00e9n, it was premiered in Buenos Aires, and its plot was inspired by an historical episode of the early colonization of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]]: the destruction of [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Sancti Spiritu]] colony by aboriginals in 1529. ''La Rancher\u00eda'' theatre operated until its destruction in a fire in 1792. The second theatre stage in Buenos Aires was [[Teatro Coliseo]], opened in 1804 during the term of Viceroy [[Rafael de Sobremonte]]. It was the nation's longest-continuously operating stage. The musical creator of the Argentine National Anthem, [[Blas Parera]], earned fame as a theatre score writer during the early 19th century. The genre suffered during the regime of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], though it flourished alongside the economy later in the century. The national government gave Argentine theatre its initial impulse with the establishment of the [[Col\u00f3n Theatre]], in 1857, which hosted classical and operatic, as well as stage performances. Antonio Petalardo's successful 1871 gambit on the opening of the [[Teatro Opera]], inspired others to fund the growing art in Argentina.\n\n===Cinema===\n{{main|Cinema of Argentina}}\nThe Argentine film industry has historically been one of the three most developed in [[Latin American cinema]], along with those produced in [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Cinema of Brazil|Brazil]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Carl J.|last=Mora|title=Mexican Cinema: Reflections of a Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOwdFIQiTv8C&pg=PA196|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04304-6|page=196}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.argentina.ar/_es/cultura/cine/index.php |title=Argentina \u2013 Cultura \u2013 Cine |language=Spanish |date=16 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216141530/http://www.argentina.ar/_es/cultura/cine/index.php |archivedate=16 December 2008}}</ref> Started in 1896; by the early 1930s it had already become Latin America's leading film producer, a place it kept until the early 1950s.{{sfn|King|2000|p=36}} The world's first [[list of animated feature films|animated feature films]] were made and released in Argentina, by cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]], in 1917 and 1918.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.4/articles/bendazzi1.4.html|title=Quirino Cristiani, The Untold Story of Argentina's Pioneer Animator|first=Giannalberto|last=Bendazzi|publisher=Animation World Network|year=1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928121624/http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.4/articles/bendazzi1.4.html|archivedate=28 September 2013|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|caption_align=center\n|image1=Andr\u00e9s Muschietti.jpg|caption1=[[Andy Muschietti]], director of ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'', the highest-grossing horror film of all-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/stephen-king-it-the-exorcist-highest-grossing-horror-film-ever|title=Stephen King's It scares off The Exorcist to become highest-grossing horror ever|last=Mumford|first=Gwilym|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 29, 2017|accessdate=October 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114000256/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/stephen-king-it-the-exorcist-highest-grossing-horror-film-ever|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-it-movie-horror-record-despicable-me-3-kingsman-never-say-die-weekend-results-international-box-office-1202184382/|title='Blade Runner 2049' Launches With $50M Overseas; 'It' Tops $600M WW; 'Despicable 3' Hops Past 'Zootopia' \u2013 Intl Box Office|accessdate=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008205909/http://deadline.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-it-movie-horror-record-despicable-me-3-kingsman-never-say-die-weekend-results-international-box-office-1202184382/|archive-date=8 October 2017|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|image2=Marcelo Pont Verg\u00e9s.jpg|caption2=The art director of ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' won the [[Academy Award]] for that film.\n}}\n\nArgentine films have achieved worldwide recognition: the country has won two [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]], for ''[[The Official Story]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (2009), from seven nominations:\n* ''[[The Truce (1974 film)|The Truce]]'' (''La tregua'') in 1974\n* ''[[Camila (film)|Camila]]'' in 1984\n* ''[[The Official Story]]'' (''La historia oficial'') in 1985\n* ''[[Tango (1998 film)|Tango]]'' in 1998\n* ''[[Son of the Bride]]'' (''El hijo de la novia'') in 2001\n* ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (''El secreto de sus ojos'') in 2009\n* ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]'' (''Relatos salvajes'') in 2015\n\nIn addition, Argentine composers [[Luis Enrique Bacalov]] and [[Gustavo Santaolalla]] have been honored with [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Awards for Best Original Score]], and [[Armando B\u00f3 (screenwriter)|Armando B\u00f3]] and [[Nicol\u00e1s Giacobone]] shared in the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] for 2014.
