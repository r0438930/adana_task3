In 1926, the Taylor, Hobart, and Maple Valley school districts merged to create a cooperative high school district and purchased a parcel of property for the construction of a dedicated local secondary school. This school, known as TaHoMa High School, opened in 1927 and held both junior and senior high students of the area for many years.  After several remodels, this first TaHoMa High School building became Tahoma Middle School.<ref>Tahoma School District. (2004). Tahoma Middle School Dedication [Brochure]. Maple Valley, WA: Kevin Patterson.</ref>\n\nA new building opened in 1974 as an [[Openconcept|open concept]] high school, while the previous building remained as the district's junior high. The open concept design proved unsatisfactory to the faculty at the time, and temporary walls were constructed early in the school building's life. In 1999, an intensive remodel of the Tahoma Senior High School building commenced. Following voter approval of a $10 million, four-year Instructional Technology Levy in 2006, the Tahoma School District outfitted the campus with wireless internet service, Activboard digital whiteboards, and upgraded computer labs.<ref>http://www.k12.wa.us/safs/PUB/LEV/0607/levy06.pdf</ref>\n\nThe building faced struggles with overcrowding throughout the 21st century as [[Maple Valley, Washington|Maple Valley]] experienced rapid growth. The district installed 17 portable classrooms, many of which were purchased for $1 from the neighboring [[Kent School District]].
