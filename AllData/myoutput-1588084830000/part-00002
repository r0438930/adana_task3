Narrative |publisher=National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior}}</ref> The school opened on May 1, 1875, at a church on Eustis Street, with instruction for 61 teaching students overseen by Principal Councill, assisted by Rev. Alfred Hunt.<ref name=\"NRHP Narrative\"/> By 1878, the state appropriation increased from $1,000 to $2,000 and the school expanded its enrollment and curriculum.<ref name=\"NRHP Narrative\"/>\n\nIn 1881, the faculty pooled money from their salaries to purchase {{convert|2+1/2|acres|spell=in}} on West Clinton Street. In 1885 the school, now with around 180 students, changes its name to State Normal and Industrial School of Huntsville, after the earlier addition of programs for sewing, printing, carpentry, mattress making and gardening.<ref name=\"NRHP Narrative\"/> By 1890, the school site became known as Normal, Alabama, and a post office was established. In 1891, the school was designated as a land-grant college through legislative enactment under the terms of the [[Morrill Act of 1890]]. In 1896, its name was changed to The State Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes. In 1919, the school became the State Agricultural and Mechanical Institute for Negroes. In 1948 it was renamed the Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College. AAMU became fully accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] in 1963. In June 1969, the school adopted its current name.\n\nThe new millennium saw the construction of the West Campus Complex, the erection of the 21,000-seat Louis Crews Stadium, the renovations of buildings and the moving of athletic programs to the [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]] (SWAC). The School of Engineering and Technology facility was built in 2002, and the Ph.D. program in Reading and Literacy was established. [[Andrew Hugine]] was approved by the Board of Trustees as the 11th president on June 18, 2009. In 2015, the Board of Trustees approved out-of-state scholarships for the Fall 2016 semester. The scholarships are contingent on prospective students meeting various academic qualifications.\n\n==Campus==\nThe campus grounds were designed by the [[Olmsted Brothers]] firm. The J.F. Drake Memorial Learning Resources Center was renovated in 2002, adding over 15,000 square feet (1,400 m\u00b2), an interactive Distance Learning Auditorium, conference, study and class rooms, lounges, and computer lab. The State Black Archives Research Center and Museum is located in the James H. Wilson Building, a national registered historical structure.\n[[Louis Crews Stadium]] is the sixth largest stadium in Alabama. [[Elmore Gymnasium]] is home to the basketball teams, and was once rated as one of the toughest places for opponents to play. In 1994, the Mamie Foster Student Living/Learning Complex was erected. Groundbreaking was held for the School of Business facility in 1995 and Louis Crews Stadium and Ernest L. Knight Complex Residence Hall construction began. The Engineering and Technology building known as Bond Hall was completed in 2002 and opened for classes in January 2003. The Normal Historic Preservation Association was incorporated on April 15, 2009, to help preserve and protect the Alabama A&M University National Historic District. The campus is served by the Bulldog Transit Shuttle bus system. A new 600-bed residence hall was constructed and opened for students January 2018, and construction planning of a new Event Center was approved by the Board of Trustees in September 2019.\n\n==Academics==\nThe university awards 41 Baccalaureate, 23 Master's, one EdS, and four PhD degrees.

Narrative |publisher=National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior}}</ref> The school opened on May 1, 1875, at a church on Eustis Street, with instruction for 61 teaching students overseen by Principal Councill, assisted by Rev. Alfred Hunt.<ref name=\"NRHP Narrative\"/> By 1878, the state appropriation increased from $1,000 to $2,000 and the school expanded its enrollment and curriculum.<ref name=\"NRHP Narrative\"/>\n\nIn 1881, the faculty pooled money from their salaries to purchase {{convert|2+1/2|acres|spell=in}} on West Clinton Street. In 1885 the school, now with around 180 students, changes its name to State Normal and Industrial School of Huntsville, after the earlier addition of programs for sewing, printing, carpentry, mattress making and gardening.<ref name=\"NRHP Narrative\"/> By 1890, the school site became known as Normal, Alabama, and a post office was established. In 1891, the school was designated as a land-grant college through legislative enactment under the terms of the [[Morrill Act of 1890]]. In 1896, its name was changed to The State Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes. In 1919, the school became the State Agricultural and Mechanical Institute for Negroes. In 1948 it was renamed the Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College. AAMU became fully accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] in 1963. In June 1969, the school adopted its current name.\n\nThe new millennium saw the construction of the West Campus Complex, the erection of the 21,000-seat Louis Crews Stadium, the renovations of buildings and the moving of athletic programs to the [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]] (SWAC). The School of Engineering and Technology facility was built in 2002, and the Ph.D. program in Reading and Literacy was established. [[Andrew Hugine]] was approved by the Board of Trustees as the 11th president on June 18, 2009. In 2015, the Board of Trustees approved out-of-state scholarships for the Fall 2016 semester. The scholarships are contingent on prospective students meeting various academic qualifications.\n\n==Campus==\nThe campus grounds were designed by the [[Olmsted Brothers]] firm. The J.F. Drake Memorial Learning Resources Center was renovated in 2002, adding over 15,000 square feet (1,400 m\u00b2), an interactive Distance Learning Auditorium, conference, study and class rooms, lounges, and computer lab. The State Black Archives Research Center and Museum is located in the James H. Wilson Building, a national registered historical structure.\n[[Louis Crews Stadium]] is the sixth largest stadium in Alabama. [[Elmore Gymnasium]] is home to the basketball teams, and was once rated as one of the toughest places for opponents to play. In 1994, the Mamie Foster Student Living/Learning Complex was erected. Groundbreaking was held for the School of Business facility in 1995 and Louis Crews Stadium and Ernest L. Knight Complex Residence Hall construction began. The Engineering and Technology building known as Bond Hall was completed in 2002 and opened for classes in January 2003. The Normal Historic Preservation Association was incorporated on April 15, 2009, to help preserve and protect the Alabama A&M University National Historic District. The campus is served by the Bulldog Transit Shuttle bus system. A new 600-bed residence hall was constructed and opened for students January 2018, and construction planning of a new Event Center was approved by the Board of Trustees in September 2019.\n\n==Academics==\nThe university awards 41 Baccalaureate, 23 Master's, one EdS, and four PhD degrees.
