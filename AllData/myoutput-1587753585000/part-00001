According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], Attleboro had a population of 43,593 in 2010.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Attleboro city, Massachusetts |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=December 2, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAttleboro is located about {{convert|10|mi|km}} west of [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]], the same distance to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], {{convert|18|mi|km}} northwest of [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]], and {{convert|39|mi}} south of [[Boston]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1634, English settlers first arrived in the territory that is now Attleboro.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cityofattleboro.us/historicalcommission/history.htm | title=Attleboro Timeline | publisher=City of Attleboro Historical Commission | accessdate=2012-05-30 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811000625/http://www.cityofattleboro.us/historicalcommission/history.htm | archive-date=2011-08-11 | url-status=dead }}</ref> It was later incorporated from [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts|Rehoboth]] from the [[Pokanoket]]  tribe. The deed that granted them the land was written by Native American [[Wamsutta]]. The land was divided in 1694 as the [[New England town|town]] of Attleborough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mocavo.com/Sketch-of-the-History-of-Attleborough-From-Its-Settlement-to-the-Present-Time/105905/28|title=Sketch of the History of Attleborough: From Its Settlement to the Present Time|work=Mocavo|accessdate=4 March 2016}}</ref> It included the towns of [[Cumberland, Rhode Island]], until 1747 and [[North Attleborough, Massachusetts]], until 1887. In 1697 in response to an unwanted amount of disturbances, mainly from nearby tribes of natives, the town had a meeting and ended up deciding that selectmen would keep tabs on strangers and foreigners as well as banning certain ones from entering the town. The town was reincorporated in 1914 as the City of Attleboro, with the \"-ugh\" removed from the name, although North Attleborough kept it. Like many towns in Massachusetts, it was named for [[Attleborough|a British town]].\n\nDuring the Native American insurgency in the colonial era, Nathaniel Woodcock, the son of an Attleborough resident, was murdered, and his head was placed on a pole in his father's front yard. His father's house is now a historical site. It is rumored that [[George Washington]] once passed through Attleborough and stayed near the Woodcock Garrison House at the Hatch Tavern, where he exchanged a shoe buckle with Israel Hatch, a revolutionary soldier and the new owner of the Garrison House.\n\nThe city became known for jewelry manufacturing in 1913, particularly because of the [[L.G. Balfour Company]]. That company has since moved out of the city, and the site of the former plant has been converted into a riverfront park. Attleboro was once known as \"The Jewelry Capital of the World\", and jewelry manufacturing firms continue to operate there. One such is the Guyot Brothers Company, which was started in 1904.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guyotbrothers.com/aboutus.htm |title=Brief history of jewelry findings manufacturer Guyot Brothers |publisher=Guyot Brothers Company, Inc. |year=2003\u20132007 |accessdate=2007-06-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615145755/http://www.guyotbrothers.com/aboutus.htm |archivedate=15 June 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> General Findings, M.S.

Attleboro and [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] are both served by the [[Greater Attleboro Taunton Regional Transit Authority]], or GATRA, which provides bus transit between the two cities and the surrounding regions.\n\n==Religion==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2012}}\nReligions represented in Attleboro reflect the historic ethnic makeup of the community. The three Catholic churches \u2014 St. John, St. Theresa of the Little Flower, and St. Vincent de Paul \u2014 reflect the English and Irish, the former French (now Hispanic), and the Portuguese neighborhoods, respectively.\n\nAll Saints [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] (1890) on North Main Street provides a traditional Anglican presence, although the church is now very diverse. In 2007 it divided over the liberal policies of the US Episcopal Church, resulting in the establishment of All Saints Anglican Church in the Hebronville village of Attleboro. This church is affiliated with an Anglican diocese in [[Uganda]].\n\nCentenary [[United Methodist Church]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cumc.thischurch.org/|title=Centenary United Methodist Church \u2013 Come and See \u2013 Go and Tell \u2013 Attleboro, MA|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2016}}</ref> on North Main Street began on November 26, 1865, as a fellowship meeting in a building on Railroad Avenue. The first church building on the present site was dedicated in 1896 under the name of Davis Methodist Episcopal Church. The structure was destroyed by fire in 1883. The rebuilt church was named Centenary Methodist Episcopal Church in 1884, commemorating American Methodism's 100th anniversary. In 1998 Centenary and the Hebron Methodist were consolidated into one church.\n[[File:Second Congregational Church, Attleboro, Massachusetts.jpg|thumb|right|Second Congregational Church]]\n[[Second Congregational Church of Attleboro (Massachusetts)|Second Congregational Church]] (1748), near the town common, is typical of a New England town and is the founding church of what was then East Attleboro. It is a daughter church of the First Congregational Church in the Oldtown section of North Attleborough.  Originally located in a meeting house on what is now the common, Second Congregational had a stately white clapboard building built in 1825. It was removed in the early 1950s to make way for the addition of a new Fellowship Hall and education rooms. The main red brick building and clock tower were built in 1904 beside the white church. In the early 1960s the interior of the sanctuary and the entrance were dramatically remodeled, resulting in a blend of high Victorian style and the open feel of mid-century modern. The church owns the Old Kirk Yard Cemetery to its rear, where many of the town's earliest families are buried. In its tower is the clock, owned originally by the city and now by the church. The Jack & Jill School has operated at the church for over 70 years. One of the city's elementary schools is named in honor of the church's first settled minister, the Reverend Peter Thacher.\n\nProtestant denominations represented in Attleboro include Baptist (Grace Baptist on Oakhill Avenue, Word of Truth Baptist on Union Street,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtbc.net|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2016}}</ref> and First Baptist on South Main), [[Advent Christian]] (also on Pleasant), [[Fruit of the Spirit Mission Church]] (Leroy Street), and [[Assembly of God]] (the [[South Attleboro AOG]] on Newport Avenue). The [[Bethany Village Fellowship]], formerly Bethany Congregational Church, (1886) is also on Newport Avenue.

The deed that granted them the land was written by Native American [[Wamsutta]]. The land was divided in 1694 as the [[New England town|town]] of Attleborough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mocavo.com/Sketch-of-the-History-of-Attleborough-From-Its-Settlement-to-the-Present-Time/105905/28|title=Sketch of the History of Attleborough: From Its Settlement to the Present Time|work=Mocavo|accessdate=4 March 2016}}</ref> It included the towns of [[Cumberland, Rhode Island]], until 1747 and [[North Attleborough, Massachusetts]], until 1887. In 1697 in response to an unwanted amount of disturbances, mainly from nearby tribes of natives, the town had a meeting and ended up deciding that selectmen would keep tabs on strangers and foreigners as well as banning certain ones from entering the town. The town was reincorporated in 1914 as the City of Attleboro, with the \"-ugh\" removed from the name, although North Attleborough kept it. Like many towns in Massachusetts, it was named for [[Attleborough|a British town]].\n\nDuring the Native American insurgency in the colonial era, Nathaniel Woodcock, the son of an Attleborough resident, was murdered, and his head was placed on a pole in his father's front yard. His father's house is now a historical site. It is rumored that [[George Washington]] once passed through Attleborough and stayed near the Woodcock Garrison House at the Hatch Tavern, where he exchanged a shoe buckle with Israel Hatch, a revolutionary soldier and the new owner of the Garrison House.\n\nThe city became known for jewelry manufacturing in 1913, particularly because of the [[L.G. Balfour Company]]. That company has since moved out of the city, and the site of the former plant has been converted into a riverfront park. Attleboro was once known as \"The Jewelry Capital of the World\", and jewelry manufacturing firms continue to operate there.

It is a daughter church of the First Congregational Church in the Oldtown section of North Attleborough.  Originally located in a meeting house on what is now the common, Second Congregational had a stately white clapboard building built in 1825. It was removed in the early 1950s to make way for the addition of a new Fellowship Hall and education rooms. The main red brick building and clock tower were built in 1904 beside the white church. In the early 1960s the interior of the sanctuary and the entrance were dramatically remodeled, resulting in a blend of high Victorian style and the open feel of mid-century modern. The church owns the Old Kirk Yard Cemetery to its rear, where many of the town's earliest families are buried. In its tower is the clock, owned originally by the city and now by the church. The Jack & Jill School has operated at the church for over 70 years. One of the city's elementary schools is named in honor of the church's first settled minister, the Reverend Peter Thacher.\n\nProtestant denominations represented in Attleboro include Baptist (Grace Baptist on Oakhill Avenue, Word of Truth Baptist on Union Street,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtbc.net|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2016}}</ref> and First Baptist on South Main), [[Advent Christian]] (also on Pleasant), [[Fruit of the Spirit Mission Church]] (Leroy Street), and [[Assembly of God]] (the [[South Attleboro AOG]] on Newport Avenue).
