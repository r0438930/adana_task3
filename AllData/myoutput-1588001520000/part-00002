It is located in the [[Districts of Copenhagen|district]] of [[Indre By]], and is named after the historic ''N\u00f8rreport [[city gate]]'', near the original location. It is one of the busiest railway station in Denmark, serving 165,000 people daily. The entire station is underground, with three pairs of platforms: one for S-trains, one for main line trains and one for the metro. The station is located on the [[Boulevard Line]] of the S-train and main line network. Several bus lines run through and start from N\u00f8rreport above ground.\n\nLocated in fare zone 1, it serves lines [[M1 (Copenhagen)|M1]] and [[M2 (Copenhagen)|M2]] of the Metro, most [[S-train]] lines, [[regional train]]s to [[Zealand]] and southern [[Sweden]], intercity trains to [[Esbjerg]] and international trains to [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[Gothenburg]], Sweden, and trains to other places, but not express trains. The station has bicycle parking facilities, and bicycles are allowed on board the trains, but not during rush hours.\n\n==History==\nThe station opened on 1 July 1918, as part of the tunnel which would connect the stations [[\u00d8sterport station|\u00d8sterport]] and [[Copenhagen Central Station]]. S-train service began on 15 May 1934.\n\nIn order to let passengers easily change from S-trains and regional trains to the Metro and vice versa, a tunnel was constructed to connect the train platforms with the Metro platforms. The S-train platforms were therefore closed partially from March 2000 to February 2002, allowing only the front-most four doors to open at the station.\n\nWith the opening of the first phase of the Metro on 19 October 2002, N\u00f8rreport station started serving M1 and M2. The station was the original terminus until it moved to [[Frederiksberg station|Frederiksberg]] when phase 2A opened on 29 May 2003.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:N\u00f8rreport Station 01.JPG|Former station building (now demolished)\nFile:N\u00f8rreport Station 2014.JPG|One of the entrances to the S-train and regional platforms (the metro can be reached from these two platforms)\nFile:N\u00f8rreport Metro station entrance.jpg|Entrance to the Metro station (the S-train & regional-train platforms cen be reached from the metro platform also)\nFile:N\u00f8rreport Station 2015 16.JPG|Regional Platform\n</gallery>\n\n==Plans==\n{{Update|section|date=May 2014|cat=Rail transport articles in need of updating}}\nThe current station building is worn down and dimly lit, and the air quality is poor because of diesel trains, at least on the regional train platform. Passengers also have to cross busy streets to access the station. Therefore, [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]] has presented a proposal for a new station. One of the adjacent roads will be [[pedestrianised]], thereby make the station easier to access. A new glass roof at ground level will allow more light into the station. The new station design would also improve air quality thanks to a new ventilation system.\n\nThe proposal is a product of discussions between DSB, the [[Greater Copenhagen Authority]] and the [[Copenhagen Municipality]]. The decision to go ahead was made in 2009 and the rebuilding takes place between 2011 and 2016. The [[S-train]] platform has been renovated and remains open. The platforms for regional and intercity trains are undergoing renovation and are estimated to remain closed until April 2014.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=December 2010}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat-inline|N\u00f8rreport Station}}\n* [http://m.dk/stations/stationer/noerreport N\u00f8rreport Metro station on www.m.dk] {{in lang|da}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170411095841/http://intl.m.dk/stations/stationer/noerreport N\u00f8rreport Metro station on www.m.dk] {{in lang|en}}\n* [https://www.dsb.dk/kundeservice/stationer/norreport/ N\u00f8rreport Railway station on www.dsb.dk] {{in lang|da}}\n\n\n{{Copenhagen Metro}}\n\n{{Copenhagen}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Norreport Station}}\n[[Category:Copenhagen Metro stations]]\n[[Category:Railway stations in Copenhagen]]\n[[Category:Copenhagen S-train stations]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1918]]\n[[Category:Railway stations located underground in Denmark]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Copenhagen metro station}}\n{{Infobox station \n| name          = N\u00f8rreport\n| type          = [[List of S-train stations|S-train]], [[:Category:Railway stations in Denmark|DSB]] and [[List of Copenhagen Metro stations|Copenhagen Metro]] station\n| image         = \n[[File:N\u00f8rreport Station 2015 02.JPG|thumb|N\u00f8rreport Station (2015)]]\n| image_caption = \n| address       = \n| coordinates   = {{Coord|55|41|00|N|12|34|18|E|type:railwaystation_region:DK|display=inline,title}}\n| line          = [[Boulevard Line]]<br>[[M1 (Copenhagen)|M1]] and [[M2 (Copenhagen)|M2]]\n| other         = \n| structure     = Underground\n| platform      = 3\n| depth         =    \n| levels        = 2\n| tracks        = 6\n| parking       = \n| bicycle       = \n| baggage_check = \n| opened        = 1 July 1918<br/>19 October 2002 (Metro)\n| closed        = \n| rebuilt       = 15 May 1934 (S-train)\n| electrified   = 1934 (S-train), 1986 (Mainline)\n| ADA           = \n| code          = \n| owned         = [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]]\n| zone          = \n| smartcardname = \n| smartcardstatus = \n| former        = \n| passengers    = \n| pass_year     = \n| pass_percent  = \n| pass_system   = \n| mpassengers   = \n| services      = {{s-rail|title=STL}}\n{{s-line|system=STL|line=H|previous=Vesterport|next=\u00d8sterport|rows1=2}}\n{{s-line|system=STL|line=C|previous=Vesterport|next=\u00d8sterport|hide1=yes}}\n{{s-line|system=STL|line=Bx|previous=Vesterport|next=\u00d8sterport|rows1=2}}\n{{s-line|system=STL|line=B|previous=Vesterport|next=\u00d8sterport|hide1=yes}}\n{{s-line|system=STL|line=E|previous=Vesterport|next=\u00d8sterport}}\n{{s-line|system=STL|line=A|previous=Vesterport|next=\u00d8sterport}}\n{{s-rail-next|title=CMT}}\n{{s-line|system=CMT|line=M1|previous=Forum|next=Kongens Nytorv|rows1=2}}\n{{s-line|system=CMT|line=M2|next=Kongens Nytorv|hide1=yes}}\n{{s-rail-next|title=DSB}}\n{{s-line|system=DSB|line=R40|previous=\u00d8sterport|next=K\u00f8benhavn H|rows1=2}}\n{{s-line|system=DSB|line=R40a|previous=\u00d8sterport|next=K\u00f8benhavn H|hide1=yes|rows2=2}}\n{{s-line|system=DSB|line=CphRos|previous=\u00d8sterport|next=K\u00f8benhavn H|type=\u00d8sterport|rows1=4|hide2=yes}}\n{{s-line|system=DSB|line=R50|previous=\u00d8sterport|next=K\u00f8benhavn H|type=\u00d8sterport|hide1=yes}}\n{{s-line|system=DSB|line=R54|previous=\u00d8sterport|next=K\u00f8benhavn H|hide1=yes|type2=Both}}\n{{s-line|system=DSB|line=R56|previous=\u00d8sterport|next=K\u00f8benhavn H|hide1=yes}}\n| map_locator   = \n| web           = \n}}\n'''N\u00f8rreport Station''' is an [[S-train (Copenhagen)|S-train]], [[Copenhagen Metro|metro]] and [[main line (railway)|main line]] [[railway station]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].
