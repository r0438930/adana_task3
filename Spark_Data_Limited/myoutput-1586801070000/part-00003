{"title_page": "Structural unemployment", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=March 2010}}\n'''Structural unemployment''' is a form of [[involuntary unemployment]] caused by a mismatch between the skills that workers in the economy can offer, and the skills demanded of workers by employers (also known as the '''skills gap''').  Structural unemployment is often brought about by [[technological change]]s that make the job skills of many workers obsolete. \n\nStructural unemployment is one of three categories of unemployment distinguished by [[economics|economists]], the others being [[frictional unemployment]] and [[cyclical unemployment]].\n\nBecause it requires either migration or re-training, structural unemployment can be long-term and slow to fix.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5955NE20091006 | work=Reuters | title=Structural unemployment crisis stalking U.S. economy | date=October 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Causes and examples ==\n{{further|Technological unemployment|Productivity improving technologies (economic history)}}\n\nFrom an individual perspective, structural unemployment can be due to:\n* Inability to afford or decision not to pursue further education or [[On-the-job training|job training]].\n* Choice of a field of study which did not produce marketable job skills.\n* Inability to afford relocation.\n* Inability to relocate due to inability to sell a house (for example due to the collapse of a [[real estate bubble]] or of the local economy).\n* Decision not to relocate, in order to stay with a spouse, family, friends, etc.<ref>[https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr566.pdf Mismatch Unemployment], Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report No. 566, June 2013; accessed 2016-06-17]</ref>\n\nFrom a larger perspective, there can be a number of reasons for structural unemployment across large numbers of workers:\n* Technological [[obsolescence]] makes a specific expertise useless.  For example, demand for manual typesetters disappeared with digitization of printing plate production.\n* [[Productivity]] increases reduce the number of workers (with the same or similar skills) needed to satisfy [[demand]].\n* New technology significantly increases productivity, but requires a smaller number of higher-skilled workers.  For example, fewer agricultural workers are needed when the work is [[mechanized agriculture|mechanized]]; those that remain must be trained to operate equipment.  Another common example is the use of [[industrial robot]]s to automate manufacturing. A study by [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne found in 2013 that almost half of U.S jobs are at risk of automation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|last2=Osborne|first2=Michael A.|date=2017-01-01|title=The future of employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerisation?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162516302244|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|language=en|volume=114|pages=254\u2013280|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019|issn=0040-1625}}</ref>\n* Competition causes the same jobs to move to a different location, and workers do not or cannot follow.  Examples:\n** Manufacturing jobs in the [[United States]] moved from what are now called [[Rust Belt]] cities to lower-cost cities in the South and rural areas.\n** [[Globalization]] has caused many manufacturing jobs to move from high-wage to low-wage countries.\n** [[Free trade agreement]]s can cause jobs to move as competitive advantage changes.\n* Political changes, for example the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]].\n\nLarge-scale changes in the economy can be particularly challenging.  For example, if a large company is the only employer in a given industry for a certain city, when it closes workers will have no competing company to move to, and the local education system and government will be burdened with many people who need job re-training all at once (possibly at the same time the local economy fails to create new jobs due to decreased overall demand).\n\nEmployers may also reject workers for reasons unrelated to skills or geography, so for example structural unemployment can also result from [[discrimination]].\n\nWhile temporary changes in overall demand for labor cause [[cyclical unemployment]], structural unemployment can be caused by temporary changes in demand from different industries. For example, [[seasonal unemployment]] often affects [[farm worker]]s after harvesting is complete, and workers in [[resort town]]s after the tourist season ends.  The [[dot-com bubble]] caused a temporary spike in demand for information technology workers, which was suddenly reversed in 2000\u20132001.\n\nStructural unemployment is often associated with workers being unable to shift from industry to industry, but it can also happen within industries as technology changes the nature of work within a given field.<ref>[http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2012/04/the-structure-of-the-structural-unemployment-question.html The structure of the structural unemployment question], Macroblog, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, April 9, 2012; accessed 2016-06-17</ref><ref>[http://burning-glass.com/research/production-skills-gap/ Production Skills Gap], Burning Glass Technologies, Jan. 8, 2014; accessed 2016-06-17</ref> This is a driver of skills gaps as technology and globalization \"hollow out\" many middle-skill jobs, positions that traditionally have not required a college degree.<ref>[http://burning-glass.com/research/middle-skills/ Bridge the Gap: Rebuilding America\u2019s Middle Skills], Harvard Business School, Accenture, and Burning Glass Technologies, Nov. 14, 2014; accessed 2016-06-17</ref>\n\n== Relation to other unemployment ==\n\nStructural unemployment is hard to separate empirically from [[frictional unemployment]], except to say that for any given individual it lasts longer. As with frictional unemployment, simple demand-side stimulus will not work to easily abolish this type of unemployment.\n\n[[Seasonal unemployment]] may be seen as a kind of structural unemployment, since it is a type of unemployment that is linked to certain kinds of jobs (construction work, migratory farm work). The most-cited official unemployment measures erase this kind of unemployment from the statistics using \"seasonal adjustment\" techniques.\n\nStructural unemployment may also be encouraged to rise by persistent [[cyclical unemployment]]: if an economy suffers from long-lasting low aggregate demand, it means that many of the unemployed become disheartened, while their skills (including job-searching skills) become \"rusty\" and obsolete.<ref>[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20150423214253/http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/app/uploads/Long-Term-Unemployment.pdf \"Long-Term Unemployment,\"] Rockefeller Foundation, May 2016; accessed 2016-06-17</ref> Problems with debt may lead to homelessness and a fall into the [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] of [[poverty]].

They assert that because the governmentally imposed minimum wage is higher than some individuals' [[marginal revenue product]] in any given job, those individuals remain unemployed because employers legally cannot pay them what they are \"worth.\"<ref>Robert Schenk.

When a minimum wage does not exist, more people may be employed, but they may be [[underemployment|underemployed]] and thus unable to fully provide for themselves.\n\nManagement professor Peter Cappelli blames poor human resource practices for complaints that not enough qualified job applicants are found, such as replacing skilled HR workers with software that is less capable of matching resumes that exhibit the right combination of skills but without word-for-word alignment with a job posting.  (This actually may be a form of [[frictional unemployment]] if a match will eventually be made, perhaps with a different employer.)  Cappelli also points to a decrease in [[apprenticeship]]s and hiring from within an organization.  Instead, companies attempt to avoid the time and cost of on-the-job training by hiring people from who already have experience doing the same job elsewhere (including at a competitor).<ref>{{cite book|title=Why Good People Can't Get Jobs: The Skills Gap and What Companies Can Do About It|isbn=978-1613630143|author=Peter Cappelli|year=2012|publisher=Wharton Digital Press}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Classical unemployment]]\n*[[Deindustrialization]]\n*[[Involuntary unemployment]]\n*[[Natural rate of unemployment]]\n*[[Jobless recovery]]\n*[[Post-industrial society]]\n*[[Reserve army of labour]]\n*[[Types of unemployment]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{Ford 2009 The lights in the tunnel}}\n* {{Citation | last = Rifkin | first = Jeremy | authorlink = Jeremy Rifkin | year = 1995 | title = [[The End of Work|The End of Work: The Decline of the Global Labor Force and the Dawn of the Post-Market Era]] | publisher = Tarcher\u2013G.P.
