In the 1860s M.J.B. Vidard introduced two-storied carriages on the Chemins de fer de l'Est, with a full body, windows, and doors; the same design lowered the floor of the lower storey to keep the center of gravity low. Vidard's carriages had a total height of {{convert|13|ft|8|in}} with the head height in the lower part of the carriage only {{convert|5|ft|5|in}}; the carriages had a capacity of 80 persons (third class) in a 2 axle vehicle of 13 tons{{which|date=April 2015}} fully loaded.<ref>{{citation| url =http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/images/0/09/Eg18700527.pdf | title = Two-storied railway carriages| page = 377| date = 27 May 1870| journal = Engineering|volume = 9}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] placed bilevel cars in [[commuter rail|commuter service]] in the Chicago area in 1950.

Such a design will fit under more [[bridge]]s, [[tunnel]]s and [[Overhead line|power wires]] ([[structure gauge]]). For cost and safety, this design also minimizes car height ([[loading gauge]]) and lowers the centre of gravity.\n\nDepending on train station platform heights, three designs can be used for entry \u2013 high platforms require use of a \"split level\" car design, where the doors are located on a middle level, with access into the upper or lower level branching off \u2013 with stairs or ramps going both up and down (sometimes this configuration includes a section of seating at the middle level in the entry section, with double levels only in part of the lengths of the car).<ref name=\"MAYADD\">{{cite news|title=L.I.R.R.

Occasionally a third, very tall \"two floors over-wheel\" design is used. This is a traditional single floor car \"with a second story\" design which, when using a low platform, requires steps up to a traditional floor height and then internal stairs up to the upper floor.\n\n== Platform height and floor height issues ==\nThere are four important height measurements above the railhead: [[Railway platform height|platform height]], traditional [[Railway platform height|floor height]], downstairs floor height and upstairs floor height. Platform height determines the level entry height for wheeled objects, such as luggage, strollers, wheelchairs and bicycles. Platform height is ideally standardized across all stations the train serves. Traditional rail car floor height matters for end doors connecting to existing single floor rail cars. Downstairs or lowest floor height is primarily determined by the thickness of the beams connecting the span between the wheels and bogies (trucks) of a rail car. The upstairs floor or highest floor height is above the lowest floor and must fit under bridges and tunnels. Level entry floor height must match the platform height. Hopefully either the traditional or downstairs floor height already matches the platform height. Despite the name \"bilevel\" or \"double-decker\", for maximum compatibility the rail car will have up to four different floor heights. High platform design (Using outside steps to avoid having a level entry from the platform) is troublesome.\n\n===Common low-platform design===\nMost [[Railway platform height|low-platform]] double-decker trains have level entry onto the lower level of the car, allowing wheelchair access. There are two-floor heights (upstairs and downstairs) in these \"bilevel\" cars. There is a staircase between floors inside the car. [[Gangway connection|Connecting doors]] between cars are either at the (higher) upper floor or at an intermediate level over the bogies. In the former case, connecting directly to a single level car causes drag and connecting door problems.\n\nIn the western USA, cars are of the upper-level-connection type. They use low-platform stations, because the traditional single floor trains all had exterior entry steps to maximize flexibility (emergency and temporary stops) and minimize infrastructure costs. There are no examples of two-floor platforms, so there are no platform doors on the upper floor. Car roof lines lengthwise are flat for connecting doors to the upstairs of bi-level cars. A Bombardier Amtrak [[Superliner (railcar)|Superliner]] car is {{convert|16|ft|2|in|mm|0}} tall.\n\n===Uncommon very tall design===\nThere are several very tall bilevel cars (e.g. [[Colorado Railcar]] has {{convert|19|ft|9+1/2|in|m mm|sigfig=4}} . They typically are described as a traditional rail car with a second story. Most of these cars serve low platforms so they have exterior steps up to the traditional \"over-wheel\" floor height e.g. US {{convert|51|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. [[Gangway connection|End doors]] connect at the traditional height of existing rolling stock. Some cars have upstairs end doors as well. Many of these cars also include outside balconies on either the upper or lower level. Upstairs and downstairs connect by interior stairs. These cars can fit most able people, but lack level entry. On almost all these cars the upper level consists of a full length glass dome. Some cars are self-propelled [[Multiple Units]] so using traditional floor heights appears fixed. In towed cars it is possible to lower the downstairs floor between the wheels/bogies so that level entry is possible with more than {{convert|500|mm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} of added headroom and interior steps from that floor to the traditional floor.\n\n==Operators==\n\n===Argentina===\n\n[[File:Coche Toshiba Doble Piso, Ferrocarril Sarmiento, Castelar, Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|Argentine double-decker electric coaches.]]\n\nIn 2005, [[Emprendimientos Ferroviarios]] (Emfer), [[Trenes de Buenos Aires]] (TBA (Trains of Buenos Aires), [[National Institute of Industrial Technology]] and the Argentine National Government subscribed to a framework agreement to start the national designing and construction of bi-level electric trains. This was decided due to the overwhelming and increasing number of passengers using the {{RailGauge|1676mm}} gauge urban [[Sarmiento Line]], serving the centre and east of [[Greater Buenos Aires]]. The first prototype was released in 2005, but mass-production only started in mid 2008. In 2013, these coaches were retired from the line and replaced with new [[CSR EMU (Argentina)|CSR Electric Multiple Units]], though it remains unclear if the Emfer trains will be moved elsewhere in the country.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.trenvista.net/noticias-ferroviarias/resto-del-mundo/argentina/linea-sarmiento-estrena-trenes-nuevos/ | title=La l\u00ednea Sarmiento estrena hoy nuevos trenes | date=21 July 2014 | first=Miguel | last=Bustos | publisher=Trenvista | language=es | accessdate=6 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Emprendimientos Ferroviarios and Trenes de Buenos Aires presented non-engined double-decker coaches for a {{convert|100|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} diesel interurban link between [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Mercedes, Buenos Aires Province|Mercedes]] city. Attending to different technical needs, the new coaches have only two simple non-automatic doors in the ends (instead of the two electric double doors in the middle) and were designed for low platforms.\n\n===Australia===\n{{main|Rail rolling stock in New South Wales}}\n[[File:(1)Cheltenham Station-3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sydney Trains A set]]]]\n[[File:CityRail H Set stairs to upper and lower decks.jpg|thumb|Interior of a [[NSW TrainLink H set]] carriage in Sydney]]\nIn 1964, [[Tulloch Limited]] built the [[New South Wales Tulloch double deck carriage stock|first double-decker trailer cars]] for use in [[Sydney]]. They ran with [[New South Wales Sputnik carriage stock|single deck electric motor cars]]. After the success of the trailers, Tulloch built four experiment [[Sydney Trains S set|double decker power cars]] in 1968.\n\nFrom 1972, more double decker multiple units were constructed by [[Commonwealth Engineering|Comeng]] and [[UGL Rail|Goninan]]. These are now known as the [[Sydney Trains S set|S sets]]. All electric suburban and interurban trains in [[Greater Sydney]] are now double deck, though the [[Sydney Metro]] uses single deck carriages. All double deck carriages have two doors per side per carriage, with a [[Vestibuled train|vestibule]] at each end at platform height. The Sydney double deck commuter trains are {{convert|14|ft|4+1/2|in|mm|abbr=on}} high.\n\nThe [[Public Transport Corporation]] in [[Melbourne]] ordered a prototype [[4D (train)|Double Deck Development and Demonstration]] train in 1991, a modification of the successful [[Sydney Trains T set|Tangara]] design used in Sydney. It suffered frequent breakdowns and spent long periods out of use. It was withdrawn in 2002 and scrapped in 2006.\n\n===Canada===\n[[File:RockyMountaineerRailCoach3998.jpg|left|thumb|A Rocky Mountaineer bi-level car built by Colorado Railcar]]\nCanada's national intercity passenger railway company, [[Via Rail]], does not currently operate any bilevel cars in its rolling stock fleet although during the late 1980s and early 1990s it had examined purchasing [[Superliner (railcar)|Superliner II]] equipment; this did not occur as the company endured a significant budget cut in 1990 and opted to instead rebuild the former [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] stainless steel passenger car fleet produced by the [[Budd Company]].\n\nCommuter train services operated by [[GO Transit]], [[West Coast Express]], and [[Exo (public transit)|Exo]] use bi-level cars produced by [[Bombardier Transportation]] or its predecessor companies. All rolling stock for both GO Transit and West Coast Express, and part of Exo's fleet, consists of [[Bombardier BiLevel Coach]]es. However, Exo mainly operates [[Bombardier MultiLevel Coach]]es. These cars (designed in collaboration with [[NJ Transit Rail Operations|NJ Transit]]; see [[#Northeastern United States and Quebec|below]]) were built to be operable within the restrictive structure gauge of the [[Mount Royal Tunnel]] and to accommodate the low level platforms along the [[Deux-Montagnes line]] as well as the {{convert|51|in|0|adj=on}} high platforms of [[Montreal Central Station]]. They are {{convert|14|ft|6|in||abbr=on}} high. Previously, the region had a fleet of [[Pullman Gallery Car|gallery cars]] produced in 1969 by [[Canadian Vickers]] for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s \"TownTrain\" service; CPR's commuter rail operations in Montreal were transferred to public authorities in October 1982, and these bilevel cars have now been retired.\n\nOlder bilevel cars used in Canada are not low-floor designs and are therefore not wheelchair accessible. New bilevel cars such as the BiLevel and Multilevel coaches are wheelchair accessible, allowing operators of those cars to offer spaces for wheelchair passengers.\n\nSome privately owned passenger rail operators also use bilevel passenger cars in their fleets: [[Ontario Northland]]'s intercity passenger train ''[[Polar Bear Express]]'' operates a [[Dome car|domed car]] that has two levels, however, this car is not technically considered a bilevel passenger rail car.

All LIRR bilevel passenger rail cars have two wide quarter-point doors on each side, for high level platforms only.  The bilevel cars used by NJ Transit and Exo have four doors on each side, two quarter-point doors at high level platform height and one at each end vestibule, with traps used to reach low level platforms. The bilevel cars used by MBTA have side doors with traps at each end vestibule. MARC operates both of the latter two types of cars.\n\n====California====\nDue to the typically-generous clearances on California railroads due to freight railroads expanding clearances to accommodate double-stacked containers, bilevel cars are common in the state. The [[California Department of Transportation]] owns 88 [[California Car (railcar)|California Car]]s, which are based on the [[Superliner (railcar)|Superliner]] body shell, but with high-density interiors suitable for corridor trains.

Platform height determines the level entry height for wheeled objects, such as luggage, strollers, wheelchairs and bicycles. Platform height is ideally standardized across all stations the train serves. Traditional rail car floor height matters for end doors connecting to existing single floor rail cars. Downstairs or lowest floor height is primarily determined by the thickness of the beams connecting the span between the wheels and bogies (trucks) of a rail car. The upstairs floor or highest floor height is above the lowest floor and must fit under bridges and tunnels. Level entry floor height must match the platform height. Hopefully either the traditional or downstairs floor height already matches the platform height. Despite the name \"bilevel\" or \"double-decker\", for maximum compatibility the rail car will have up to four different floor heights. High platform design (Using outside steps to avoid having a level entry from the platform) is troublesome.\n\n===Common low-platform design===\nMost [[Railway platform height|low-platform]] double-decker trains have level entry onto the lower level of the car, allowing wheelchair access. There are two-floor heights (upstairs and downstairs) in these \"bilevel\" cars. There is a staircase between floors inside the car. [[Gangway connection|Connecting doors]] between cars are either at the (higher) upper floor or at an intermediate level over the bogies. In the former case, connecting directly to a single level car causes drag and connecting door problems.\n\nIn the western USA, cars are of the upper-level-connection type. They use low-platform stations, because the traditional single floor trains all had exterior entry steps to maximize flexibility (emergency and temporary stops) and minimize infrastructure costs. There are no examples of two-floor platforms, so there are no platform doors on the upper floor. Car roof lines lengthwise are flat for connecting doors to the upstairs of bi-level cars. A Bombardier Amtrak [[Superliner (railcar)|Superliner]] car is {{convert|16|ft|2|in|mm|0}} tall.\n\n===Uncommon very tall design===\nThere are several very tall bilevel cars (e.g. [[Colorado Railcar]] has {{convert|19|ft|9+1/2|in|m mm|sigfig=4}} . They typically are described as a traditional rail car with a second story. Most of these cars serve low platforms so they have exterior steps up to the traditional \"over-wheel\" floor height e.g. US {{convert|51|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. [[Gangway connection|End doors]] connect at the traditional height of existing rolling stock. Some cars have upstairs end doors as well. Many of these cars also include outside balconies on either the upper or lower level. Upstairs and downstairs connect by interior stairs. These cars can fit most able people, but lack level entry. On almost all these cars the upper level consists of a full length glass dome. Some cars are self-propelled [[Multiple Units]] so using traditional floor heights appears fixed. In towed cars it is possible to lower the downstairs floor between the wheels/bogies so that level entry is possible with more than {{convert|500|mm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} of added headroom and interior steps from that floor to the traditional floor.\n\n==Operators==\n\n===Argentina===\n\n[[File:Coche Toshiba Doble Piso, Ferrocarril Sarmiento, Castelar, Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|Argentine double-decker electric coaches.]]\n\nIn 2005, [[Emprendimientos Ferroviarios]] (Emfer), [[Trenes de Buenos Aires]] (TBA (Trains of Buenos Aires), [[National Institute of Industrial Technology]] and the Argentine National Government subscribed to a framework agreement to start the national designing and construction of bi-level electric trains. This was decided due to the overwhelming and increasing number of passengers using the {{RailGauge|1676mm}} gauge urban [[Sarmiento Line]], serving the centre and east of [[Greater Buenos Aires]]. The first prototype was released in 2005, but mass-production only started in mid 2008. In 2013, these coaches were retired from the line and replaced with new [[CSR EMU (Argentina)|CSR Electric Multiple Units]], though it remains unclear if the Emfer trains will be moved elsewhere in the country.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.trenvista.net/noticias-ferroviarias/resto-del-mundo/argentina/linea-sarmiento-estrena-trenes-nuevos/ | title=La l\u00ednea Sarmiento estrena hoy nuevos trenes | date=21 July 2014 | first=Miguel | last=Bustos | publisher=Trenvista | language=es | accessdate=6 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Emprendimientos Ferroviarios and Trenes de Buenos Aires presented non-engined double-decker coaches for a {{convert|100|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} diesel interurban link between [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Mercedes, Buenos Aires Province|Mercedes]] city. Attending to different technical needs, the new coaches have only two simple non-automatic doors in the ends (instead of the two electric double doors in the middle) and were designed for low platforms.\n\n===Australia===\n{{main|Rail rolling stock in New South Wales}}\n[[File:(1)Cheltenham Station-3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sydney Trains A set]]]]\n[[File:CityRail H Set stairs to upper and lower decks.jpg|thumb|Interior of a [[NSW TrainLink H set]] carriage in Sydney]]\nIn 1964, [[Tulloch Limited]] built the [[New South Wales Tulloch double deck carriage stock|first double-decker trailer cars]] for use in [[Sydney]]. They ran with [[New South Wales Sputnik carriage stock|single deck electric motor cars]]. After the success of the trailers, Tulloch built four experiment [[Sydney Trains S set|double decker power cars]] in 1968.\n\nFrom 1972, more double decker multiple units were constructed by [[Commonwealth Engineering|Comeng]] and [[UGL Rail|Goninan]]. These are now known as the [[Sydney Trains S set|S sets]]. All electric suburban and interurban trains in [[Greater Sydney]] are now double deck, though the [[Sydney Metro]] uses single deck carriages. All double deck carriages have two doors per side per carriage, with a [[Vestibuled train|vestibule]] at each end at platform height. The Sydney double deck commuter trains are {{convert|14|ft|4+1/2|in|mm|abbr=on}} high.\n\nThe [[Public Transport Corporation]] in [[Melbourne]] ordered a prototype [[4D (train)|Double Deck Development and Demonstration]] train in 1991, a modification of the successful [[Sydney Trains T set|Tangara]] design used in Sydney. It suffered frequent breakdowns and spent long periods out of use. It was withdrawn in 2002 and scrapped in 2006.\n\n===Canada===\n[[File:RockyMountaineerRailCoach3998.jpg|left|thumb|A Rocky Mountaineer bi-level car built by Colorado Railcar]]\nCanada's national intercity passenger railway company, [[Via Rail]], does not currently operate any bilevel cars in its rolling stock fleet although during the late 1980s and early 1990s it had examined purchasing [[Superliner (railcar)|Superliner II]] equipment; this did not occur as the company endured a significant budget cut in 1990 and opted to instead rebuild the former [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] stainless steel passenger car fleet produced by the [[Budd Company]].\n\nCommuter train services operated by [[GO Transit]], [[West Coast Express]], and [[Exo (public transit)|Exo]] use bi-level cars produced by [[Bombardier Transportation]] or its predecessor companies. All rolling stock for both GO Transit and West Coast Express, and part of Exo's fleet, consists of [[Bombardier BiLevel Coach]]es. However, Exo mainly operates [[Bombardier MultiLevel Coach]]es. These cars (designed in collaboration with [[NJ Transit Rail Operations|NJ Transit]]; see [[#Northeastern United States and Quebec|below]]) were built to be operable within the restrictive structure gauge of the [[Mount Royal Tunnel]] and to accommodate the low level platforms along the [[Deux-Montagnes line]] as well as the {{convert|51|in|0|adj=on}} high platforms of [[Montreal Central Station]]. They are {{convert|14|ft|6|in||abbr=on}} high. Previously, the region had a fleet of [[Pullman Gallery Car|gallery cars]] produced in 1969 by [[Canadian Vickers]] for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s \"TownTrain\" service; CPR's commuter rail operations in Montreal were transferred to public authorities in October 1982, and these bilevel cars have now been retired.\n\nOlder bilevel cars used in Canada are not low-floor designs and are therefore not wheelchair accessible. New bilevel cars such as the BiLevel and Multilevel coaches are wheelchair accessible, allowing operators of those cars to offer spaces for wheelchair passengers.\n\nSome privately owned passenger rail operators also use bilevel passenger cars in their fleets: [[Ontario Northland]]'s intercity passenger train ''[[Polar Bear Express]]'' operates a [[Dome car|domed car]] that has two levels, however, this car is not technically considered a bilevel passenger rail car. Additionally, the rail tour company [[Rocky Mountaineer]] also uses bilevel full length dome cars built by Colorado Railcar.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===China===\n[[File:SRZ1 25Z 110743@Shoupakou (20150611161248).JPG|thumb|The [[First class travel#Railways|first class]] double-decker car (SRZ1<sub>25Z</sub>) of T5684 Shijiazhuang\u2013Qinhuangdao Express train]]\nThe first bilevel train for [[China Railway]]s was built by [[CSR Sifang Co Ltd.|Sifang]] in 1958 as Dongfeng diesel multiple unit, consisting of two locomotives and four bilevel coaches. After withdrawing Dongfeng DMU from use in 1982, China Railways redeveloped double-decker trains, the first of which rolled out from [[Nanjing Puzhen Rolling Stock Works]] in 1987 as SYZ25 and SRZ25.\n\nThe carriage designations of bilevel cars in China start with \"S\", abbreviating \"double-decker\" ({{zh|s=\u53cc\u5c42|p=shu\u0101ngc\u00e9ng|labels=no}}) in Chinese.

In addition, [[Alaska Railroad]] operates passenger trains with a mix of traditional passenger equipment and large fleets of [[Colorado Railcar]] Ultra Domes (sometimes as many as 15 in one train) owned by several major cruise ship lines.\n\n====Northeastern United States and Quebec====\nMost passenger rail lines in the Northeast have a [[loading gauge]] that can only accommodate cars  {{convert|14|ft|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} or less in height; this is due to [[structure gauge]] restrictions such as [[bridge]]s and [[tunnel]]s that are too low, and may also have [[Overhead line|electrified lines]] overhead.\n\nExceptions in this region include [[Bombardier MultiLevel Coach|bilevel passenger rail cars]] used by the [[Long Island Rail Road]] and [[NJ Transit Rail Operations|NJ Transit]], Montreal's [[Exo (public transit)|Exo]], [[MARC Train|MARC]] and [[MBTA Commuter Rail]], all of which were built to unique designs to clear specific [[structure gauge]] problems on those systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/lirr|title=LIRR \u2013 Tickets, Schedules, fares, Rail \u2013 MTA|website=web.mta.info}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njtransit.com/|title=New Jersey Transit \u2013 Home|website=www.njtransit.com}}</ref> The bilevels used on LIRR, MARC, and MBTA were built by [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company|Kawasaki Rail Car, Inc.]], while the bilevels for Exo and NJ Transit were built by [[Bombardier Transportation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombardier.com/index.jsp |title=Inc. \u2013 Bombardier \u2013 Home |publisher=Bombardier |date=2 July 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kawasakirailcar.com/mbta.htm#1 |title=Kawasaki MBCR Bi-Level Cars |accessdate=8 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726040851/http://www.kawasakirailcar.com/mbta.htm#1 |archivedate=26 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Recently Rotem has built additional new cars of a similar design for MBTA.\n\nIn each of these agencies' bilevel cars, two levels are present between the trucks of the car. At each end, stairs lead from both levels to a common floor which is located at standard height over the trucks. All LIRR bilevel passenger rail cars have two wide quarter-point doors on each side, for high level platforms only.  The bilevel cars used by NJ Transit and Exo have four doors on each side, two quarter-point doors at high level platform height and one at each end vestibule, with traps used to reach low level platforms. The bilevel cars used by MBTA have side doors with traps at each end vestibule. MARC operates both of the latter two types of cars.\n\n====California====\nDue to the typically-generous clearances on California railroads due to freight railroads expanding clearances to accommodate double-stacked containers, bilevel cars are common in the state. The [[California Department of Transportation]] owns 88 [[California Car (railcar)|California Car]]s, which are based on the [[Superliner (railcar)|Superliner]] body shell, but with high-density interiors suitable for corridor trains. These cars, along with 39 owned directly by Amtrak, are dedicated to state-subsidized [[Amtrak California]] routes including the [[San Joaquin (train)|San Joaquin]], [[Capitol Corridor]] and [[Pacific Surfliner]] routes.<ref name=\"AmtrakRoster\">{{cite web|url=http://www.on-track-on-line.com/amtk-roster-cars.shtml#California|title=On Track on Line \u2013 Amtrak Passenger Equipment Roster \u2013 Rolling Stock|first=David Warner and Harry|last=Sutton|website=www.on-track-on-line.com}}</ref> The [[Surfliner (railcar)|Surfliner]] also serves Amtrak's California lines.\n\nMetrolink which serves Southern California also has 137 active [[Bombardier BiLevel Coach|Bombardier Bi-level Coach]]es (Sentinel Fleet) and 137 [[Hyundai Rotem]] Bi-level cars (Guardian Fleet).\n\n====Florida====\n[[File:Tri-rail Bombardier BiLevel Coach.jpg|thumb|[[Bombardier BiLevel Coach]] in [[Tri-rail]] livery at the Deerfield Beach Tri-Rail station]]\nSoutheast Florida's [[Tri-Rail]] service between Miami and West Palm Beach uses Bombardier bi-level coaches similar to those of Ontario's GO Transit.\n\n====Illinois====\n[[Metra]]'s bilevel passenger cars are known as \"gallery cars\" (see below) as there is an open space between the two sides of the upper deck, allowing [[Conductor (railroad)|ticket collector]]s to check tickets on both levels from the bottom level. Chicago does not have the loading gauge problems that affect passenger rail lines in most northeastern states because it has very few railroad tunnels for the lines of these passenger trains except for a brief distance in the city. Former Metra coaches are also used by the [[Virginia Railway Express]] and Nashville's [[Music City Star]]. {{Clear}}\n\n====Massachusetts====\n[[File:MBTA car 1801 approaching Salem.JPG|thumb|right|Hyundai Rotem bilevel car approaching [[Salem, Massachusetts]]]]\n\n[[File:Outbound Needham Line train at Forest Hills.JPG|thumb|left|The MBTA utilizes both bilevel and single level railcars.]]\n\nThe [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] is the public agency responsible for operating most [[public transport]]ation services in [[Greater Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Earlier modes of public transportation in [[Boston]] were independently owned and operated; many were first folded into a single agency with the formation of the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) in 1947. The MTA was replaced in 1964 with the present-day MBTA, which was established as an individual department within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts before becoming a division of the [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] (MassDOT) in 2009. [[North Station]] is a major transportation hub located at Causeway and Nashua Streets in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]]. It is one of the city's two inbound terminals for [[Amtrak]] and [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] trains, the other being [[South Station]], the largest railroad station and intercity bus terminal in [[Greater Boston]] and [[New England]]'s second-largest transportation center after [[Logan International Airport]].\n\n====New Mexico====\nThe [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]] utilizes bilevel cars on its route from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] to [[Belen, New Mexico]]\n\n===Other countries===\n[[File:VIRM6.jpg|right|thumb|Dutch [[NS VIRM]] bilevel train at station [[Amsterdam Bijlmer ArenA]]]]\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], there are three types of double-deck trains, [[DDM-1]] carriage based trains, the [[NS DD-AR|DD-AR]] and the [[NS VIRM|VIRM (Regiorunner)]]. The VIRM, is an example from the Netherlands, of High platform (split level) double-decker cars. It is one step up from the station platform to the entrance, and from there seven steps upstairs or four steps downstairs.\n\nIn [[Spain]], several lines of [[Cercan\u00edas]] ([[Renfe]]'s commuter rail service) use double-deck trains.\n\nIn [[Portugal]], [[CP Urban Services]] and [[Fertagus]] use double-deck trains around [[Lisbon]] in commuter rail services.\n\nIn [[Germany]], [[Bombardier Double-deck Coach|Bombardier's double-deck rail cars]] are also used extensively on suburban trains by the [[Deutsche Bahn|DB]]. The same rail cars serve some of the routes on the [[Israel Railways]] network, hauled by diesel locomotives and include electric generators housed in the control car.\n\nIn [[Iran]], the [[Tehran]]-[[Hashtgerd]] suburban commuter line is served with electric push-pull hauled trainsets with double-decker carriages manufactured by [[Wagon Pars]] in Iran.\n\nIn [[South Korea]], ITX-Cheongchun, the express train of [[Korail]] uses double-decker.\n\nIn [[Romania]], some regional trains use bilevel cars.\n\nIn [[Vietnam]], the train operated by [[Vietnam Railways]] between Saigon and Phan Thiet occasionally carries double deck carriages to fulfil extra demand.\n\n==Gallery cars==\n[[File:Nippon Sharyo bi-level passenger car interior hallway.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Nippon Sharyo]] bi-level passenger car operated by [[Caltrain]]]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2012}}\nBecause of the two levels being separate on most cars, there is a physical limitation on a single conductor, as it can be difficult for him or her to verify, collect payment and sell tickets to passengers on the two levels. In 1955, the [[St. Louis Car Company]] came up with a solution in the form of the \"gallery\" car design, which features upper levels, which are \"[[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]]s\" or \"balconies\" running along both sides of the car, with an open area between them.<ref name=\"irm.org\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.irm.org/railwire/rw179a1.html |title=Illinois Railway Museum \u2013 C&NW; Gallery Cars |access-date=10 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216195612/http://www.irm.org/railwire/rw179a1.html |archive-date=16 February 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Most gallery cars have four separate galleries with four separate stairwells to the main level (one on each side, split in the middle by the central vestibule).<ref name=\"RENOVATED\">{{cite news|title=More renovated gallery cars in service on Fredericksburg Line|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gTQzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5QgGAAAAIBAJ&pg=4176,5703656&dq=gallery-car+train&hl=en|accessdate=11 January 2011|newspaper=The Free Lance-Star|date=22 February 2004}}</ref><!-- ***This contradicts the \"solution found in 1955\" sentence:*** The first gallery cars were ordered by the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]], and delivered in 1950.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=10 September 1950|title=Long time Burlington Commuters get Free Ride in New Double Deck Coach|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1950/09/10/page/191/article/long-time-burlington-commuters-get-free-ride-in-new-double-deck-coach|journal=Chicago Sunday Tribune|volume=|pages=Part 3, Metropolitan Section}}</ref>-->\n\nThe split balcony enables the conductor(s) walking along on the lower level to easily reach up and punch or validate tickets of the passengers seated on the mezzanine level. Passengers can place their tickets in clips along a lengthwise panel, located slightly above the conductor's head and within easy reach. The conductor can then check all tickets and move to the next car.\n\nMost gallery cars have a low first step at the vestibule entrance to the car, which is {{convert|14+5/8|in|mm|0}} above the head of the rail. [[Highliner|Metra Electric Highliner]] (now retired<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metrarail.com/about-metra/newsroom/metra-electrics-original-highliner-cars-officially-retired|title=Metra Electric's Original Highliner Cars Officially Retired {{!}} Metra|website=metrarail.com|language=en|access-date=9 February 2018}}</ref>) and [[Highliner|Highliner II]], however have high-level entrances for the high-level platforms on that line. [[Highliner|NICTD South Shore Line Bi-Levels]] are similar to the Metra Highliner IIs but have entrances at the end of the rail car opposite the cab with a stairwell and trap doors for low-level platforms and a station stop in the middle of 11th street in Michigan City, Indiana.\n\nThe Chicago and Northwestern was the first to receive gallery cars followed by the [[Southern Pacific]] Railroad. Today, such cars are still used by [[Metra]] in and around [[Chicago]], [[Caltrain]] along the west side of San Francisco Bay, [[Virginia Railway Express]] in Northern Virginia, Nashville's [[Music City Star]] and the NICTD's [[South Shore Line]] from Chicago to South Bend, Indiana. Chicago's commuter rail system is currently receiving new versions of these cars built by [[Nippon Sharyo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Gallery Type Bi-Level Passenger Car for METRA (2002\u2013)|url=http://www.n-sharyo.co.jp/business/tetsudo_e/pages/zusametra-pc2002.htm |publisher=NIPPON SHARYO | accessdate= 16 December 2015}}</ref> [[Caltrain]], the [[San Francisco]] peninsula [[commuter rail]] service, has recently overhauled its fleet.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Autorack]]\n** [[Piggyback (transportation)]]; Related concepts in rail-freight transport\n** [[Double-stack rail transport]]; Related concepts in rail-freight transport\n* [[Double-decker bus]]\n* [[Double-decker tram]]\n* [[California Car (railcar)]]\n* [[Dome car]]\n* [[Pullman Gallery Car]]\n* [[Super Dome (railcar)]]\n* [[Superliner (railcar)]]\n* [[Surfliner (railcar)]]\n* [[Highliner]]{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline|Double-decker trains}}\n*{{Commons category-inline|Double-decker trams}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFLqmgc0V0 Double Deck Train in China]\n\n{{Passenger cars}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bilevel Car}}\n[[Category:Double-decker rail vehicles]]\n", "name_user": "Fork99", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilevel_rail_car"}
