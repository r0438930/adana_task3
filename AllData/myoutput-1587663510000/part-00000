It portrays the life of Hatid\u017ee Muratova, a wild [[beekeeper]] in the remote mountainous village of Bekirlija, [[North Macedonia]], and follows her lifestyle before and after neighbors move in next door. Although initially planned as a short film documenting the region surrounding the river [[Bregalnica]], the documentary's area of focus changed course when directors met Hatid\u017ee. ''Honeyland'' received its world premiere at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]] on 28 January and it has grossed $1,140,879.\n\nFilming of ''Honeyland'' lasted three years, with directors collecting a total of four hundred hours of footage. Several [[environmentalism|environmental topics]] are explored, such as [[climate change]], [[biodiversity loss]], and [[exploitation of natural resources]]. Primarily focusing on the visual aspects, the directors wanted to portray humanity's balance with the [[ecosystem]] through Hatid\u017ee and [[consumerism]] and [[resource depletion]] through her neighbors. The documentary also portrays the protagonist's relationship with her bedridden mother and neighbors. ''Honeyland'' contains elements of several documentary styles, including [[fly on the wall]], [[direct cinema]], and [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]]. \n\n''Honeyland'' received universal critical acclaim from film critics who praised attention to detail and applauded the message of conservation of nature. The documentary received numerous awards and nominations at film festivals, including three awards at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]] and two nominations at the [[92nd Academy Awards]] in the categories for [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]]. ''Honeyland'' marked the first documentary in history to receive a nomination in both categories in the history of the Oscars.\n\n==Plot==\n''Honeyland'' documents the life of Hatid\u017ee Muratova, a Macedonian wild [[beekeeping|beekeeper]] of [[Turks in North Macedonia|Turkish]] descent who lives in the village of Bekirlija in the [[Lozovo Municipality|municipality of Lozovo]]. She is one of the last remaining wild beekeepers in [[North Macedonia]] and [[Europe]]. Due to its location in a secluded mountain, the village has no access to electricity or running water. Hatid\u017ee lives with her 85-year-old partly blind bedridden mother, Nazife, who is completely dependent on her daughter. She earns a living by selling honey in the country's capital [[Skopje]] which is four hours away from the village. \n\nThe atmosphere in the village changes when the nomadic rancher Hussein Sam arrives with a trailer along with his wife Ljutvie, their seven children and their imported domestic animals.<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-2020-north-macedonia-selects-honeyland-best-international-feature-category-1234863|title=Oscars: North Macedonia Selects 'Honeyland' for Best International Feature Category|last=Holdsworth|first=Nick|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=27 August 2019|accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/106712-living-and-working-with-each-other-for-those-three-years-in-almost-unbearable-life-conditions-directors-ljubo-stefanov-and-tamara-kotevska-honeyland/|title=\"Living and Working with Each Other for Those Three Years in Almost Unbearable Life Conditions\": Directors Ljubo Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska {{!}} Honeyland|website=Filmmaker|date=28 January 2019|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> Initially, Hatid\u017ee maintains good relationships with the family and spends time playing around with the children. In need of financial means, and inspired by Hatid\u017ee's way of earning money, Sam takes an interest in wild beekeeping himself. Hatid\u017ee instructs him on collecting honey and provides him with several bees so Sam can start his own colony. Despite being initially successful at it, Sam receives a demand by a customer to sell him more honey than his bees can produce. Sam disregards Hatid\u017ee's advice of always leaving half of the honey to his bees and proceeds to sell the entire honey his beehives produce. This leads to Sam's colonies attacking Hatid\u017ee's during the resource-scarce winter period. Hatid\u017ee scolds Sam for not following her advice as she finds her bee colony collapsing. Soon after, her mother passes away. As the nomadic family decides to move on to another village, Hatid\u017ee remains alone in Bekirlija.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/62254-honeyland-documentary-science-golden-rule|title=Oscar-nominated doc 'Honeyland' teaches a golden rule, rooted in science|work=Inverse.com|first=Sarah|last=Slota|date=13 January 2020|accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Conception and development==\n[[File:Bregalnica River.JPG|thumb|left|The film was originally planned as a documentary short about preserving the region surrounding river [[Bregalnica]] (''pictured'').]]\n''Honeyland'' marks [[Tamara Kotevska]]'s and [[Ljubomir Stefanov]]'s second collaboration on a documentary movie after ''Lake of Apples'' (2017).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Eagan |first1=Daniel |title='It's a Choice: To Be a Filmmaker or a Human': Ljubomir Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska on Honeyland |url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/107983-its-a-choice-to-be-a-filmmaker-or-a-human-ljubomir-stefanov-and-tamara-kotevska-on-honeyland/#.XhyTzFNKgWo |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]] |date=22 August 2019}}</ref> The movie was originally intended as [[documentary short]] financially supported by the government.

It portrays the life of Hatid\u017ee Muratova, a wild [[beekeeper]] in the remote mountainous village of Bekirlija, [[North Macedonia]], and follows her lifestyle before and after neighbors move in next door. Although initially planned as a short film documenting the region surrounding the river [[Bregalnica]], the documentary's area of focus changed course when directors met Hatid\u017ee. ''Honeyland'' received its world premiere at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]] on 28 January and it has grossed $1,140,879.\n\nFilming of ''Honeyland'' lasted three years, with directors collecting a total of four hundred hours of footage. Several [[environmentalism|environmental topics]] are explored, such as [[climate change]], [[biodiversity loss]], and [[exploitation of natural resources]]. Primarily focusing on the visual aspects, the directors wanted to portray humanity's balance with the [[ecosystem]] through Hatid\u017ee and [[consumerism]] and [[resource depletion]] through her neighbors. The documentary also portrays the protagonist's relationship with her bedridden mother and neighbors. ''Honeyland'' contains elements of several documentary styles, including [[fly on the wall]], [[direct cinema]], and [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]]. \n\n''Honeyland'' received universal critical acclaim from film critics who praised attention to detail and applauded the message of conservation of nature. The documentary received numerous awards and nominations at film festivals, including three awards at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]] and two nominations at the [[92nd Academy Awards]] in the categories for [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]]. ''Honeyland'' marked the first documentary in history to receive a nomination in both categories in the history of the Oscars.\n\n==Plot==\n''Honeyland'' documents the life of Hatid\u017ee Muratova, a Macedonian wild [[beekeeping|beekeeper]] of [[Turks in North Macedonia|Turkish]] descent who lives in the village of Bekirlija in the [[Lozovo Municipality|municipality of Lozovo]]. She is one of the last remaining wild beekeepers in [[North Macedonia]] and [[Europe]]. Due to its location in a secluded mountain, the village has no access to electricity or running water. Hatid\u017ee lives with her 85-year-old partly blind bedridden mother, Nazife, who is completely dependent on her daughter. She earns a living by selling honey in the country's capital [[Skopje]] which is four hours away from the village. \n\nThe atmosphere in the village changes when the nomadic rancher Hussein Sam arrives with a trailer along with his wife Ljutvie, their seven children and their imported domestic animals.<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-2020-north-macedonia-selects-honeyland-best-international-feature-category-1234863|title=Oscars: North Macedonia Selects 'Honeyland' for Best International Feature Category|last=Holdsworth|first=Nick|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=27 August 2019|accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/106712-living-and-working-with-each-other-for-those-three-years-in-almost-unbearable-life-conditions-directors-ljubo-stefanov-and-tamara-kotevska-honeyland/|title=\"Living and Working with Each Other for Those Three Years in Almost Unbearable Life Conditions\": Directors Ljubo Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska {{!}} Honeyland|website=Filmmaker|date=28 January 2019|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> Initially, Hatid\u017ee maintains good relationships with the family and spends time playing around with the children. In need of financial means, and inspired by Hatid\u017ee's way of earning money, Sam takes an interest in wild beekeeping himself. Hatid\u017ee instructs him on collecting honey and provides him with several bees so Sam can start his own colony. Despite being initially successful at at it, Sam receives a demand by a customer to sell him more honey than his bees can produce. Sam disregards Hatid\u017ee's advice of always leaving half of the honey to his bees and proceeds to sell the entire honey his beehives produce. This leads to Sam's colonies attacking Hatid\u017ee's during the resource-scarce winter period. Hatid\u017ee scolds Sam for not following her advice as she finds her bee colony collapsing. Soon after, her mother passes away. As the nomadic family decides to move on to another village, Hatid\u017ee remains alone in Bekirlija.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/62254-honeyland-documentary-science-golden-rule|title=Oscar-nominated doc 'Honeyland' teaches a golden rule, rooted in science|work=Inverse.com|first=Sarah|last=Slota|date=13 January 2020|accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Conception and development==\n[[File:Bregalnica River.JPG|thumb|left|The film was originally planned as a documentary short about preserving the region surrounding river [[Bregalnica]] (''pictured'').]]\n''Honeyland'' marks [[Tamara Kotevska]]'s and [[Ljubomir Stefanov]]'s second collaboration on a documentary movie after ''Lake of Apples'' (2017).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Eagan |first1=Daniel |title='It's a Choice: To Be a Filmmaker or a Human': Ljubomir Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska on Honeyland |url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/107983-its-a-choice-to-be-a-filmmaker-or-a-human-ljubomir-stefanov-and-tamara-kotevska-on-honeyland/#.XhyTzFNKgWo |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]] |date=22 August 2019}}</ref> The movie was originally intended as [[documentary short]] financially supported by the government.
