Crates have 18-in. (46-cm) \"troughs\" on each side where the piglets can safely lie without being in danger of sow overlay (when the sow lies down on top of a piglet).\n\nPiglet survival also depends on selection pressure.  Groups of piglets bred for higher survival showed no difference in mortality when weaned in farrowing crates and outdoor systems.<ref>E. M.

The most comprehensive publication to date on this subject concluded that there is no significant effect of housing on overall piglet mortality, the authors stating that \u201cDespite the fact that the crate system has been considered to reduce piglet mortality mainly through a reduction of crushing, there is not much scientific evidence for this when considering the few large surveys that compare the mortality rate in commercial herds\u201c. The review goes on to describe several large studies dating from as early as 1983, the majority of which found no difference in piglet mortality rates between loose and crated sows. The review also details an argument as to why piglet mortality rates have been reported to be somewhat higher in a comparably small number of studies, citing methodological flaws.<ref name=Pedersen>L.J.

The same effect could be achieved with larger pens that kept the animals separate, but allowed them more freedom of movement. There are also other ways of reducing, but not eliminating, aggression besides gestation crates. These include eliminating overcrowding, not mixing pigs from different litters, providing straw or other bedding material, and providing sufficient food that not only meets nutritional needs but satisfies the appetite.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weaver | first1 = SA | last2 = Morris | first2 = MC | year = 2003 | title = Science, pigs and politics: an New Zealand perspective on the phase-out of sow stalls | url = | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 51\u201366 }}</ref>  Other important means to reduce aggression among sows rely on alternative feeding methods, as many sows will compete with each other for food.

Group housing: alternative systems, alternative management. Advances in Pork Production 14:101-7.</ref>\n\nEarly veterinary studies seemed to support the use of gestation crates. According to the [[U.S. National Pork Producers Council]], which promotes pork as a food product and is a leading proponent of gestation crates, the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] \"recognize[s] gestation stalls and group housing systems as appropriate for providing for the well-being of sows during pregnancy.\"<ref name=Kaufmann1/> While the practice of immobilizing the animals in crates limits fighting, it subsequently increases the animals' stress levels, causing other health problems. The American Association of Swine Veterinarians adopted a position statement in 2002 specifying five standards of sow welfare and concluding, \"Current scientific literature indicates that individual gestation stalls meet each of the aforementioned, provided the appropriate level of stockmanship is administered.\"<ref>\"AASV Position Statement: Pregnant Sow Housing.\" Accessed 31 July 2012.</ref>\n\n{{farming}}\n''The Washington Post'' reported in 2001 that researchers have not found sows in gestation crates to have elevated levels of [[stress hormone]]s. The paper notes that this suggests their overall health is not compromised. Some producers in Europe use a \u201cfree access\u201d maternity pen configuration in which sows are in individual pens for the first four weeks of pregnancy but can \u201cunlock\u201d the stall by backing out and entering a common area. The producers observed that pregnant pigs will stay in the individual pens more than 90 percent of the time, and return to the same stall more than 90 percent of the time.<ref name=\"Salek-Johnson\">{{cite news|last=Salek-Johnson|first=Janeen|title=Individual pens for sows' safety|url=http://thegazette.com/2012/09/30/individual-pens-for-sows-safety/|accessdate=10 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]]|date=30 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nHowever, other veterinary studies contradict those earlier studies.

Crates have 18-in. (46-cm) \"troughs\" on each side where the piglets can safely lie without being in danger of sow overlay (when the sow lies down on top of a piglet).\n\nPiglet survival also depends on selection pressure.  Groups of piglets bred for higher survival showed no difference in mortality when weaned in farrowing crates and outdoor systems.<ref>E. M.

The most comprehensive publication to date on this subject concluded that there is no significant effect of housing on overall piglet mortality, the authors stating that \u201cDespite the fact that the crate system has been considered to reduce piglet mortality mainly through a reduction of crushing, there is not much scientific evidence for this when considering the few large surveys that compare the mortality rate in commercial herds\u201c. The review goes on to describe several large studies dating from as early as 1983, the majority of which found no difference in piglet mortality rates between loose and crated sows. The review also details an argument as to why piglet mortality rates have been reported to be somewhat higher in a comparably small number of studies, citing methodological flaws.<ref name=Pedersen>L.J.

The same effect could be achieved with larger pens that kept the animals separate, but allowed them more freedom of movement. There are also other ways of reducing, but not eliminating, aggression besides gestation crates. These include eliminating overcrowding, not mixing pigs from different litters, providing straw or other bedding material, and providing sufficient food that not only meets nutritional needs but satisfies the appetite.<ref>SA Weaver and MC Morris, \"Science, pigs and politics: an New Zealand perspective on the phase-out of sow stalls,\" ''Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics'' 17 (2003), 51\u201366.</ref>  Other important means to reduce aggression among sows rely on alternative feeding methods, as many sows will compete with each other for food.  These include trickle feeding systems, individual feeding stalls, and electronic sow feeding equipment, all of which resolve feed competition among pigs.<ref>Gonyou HW. 2003. Group housing: alternative systems, alternative management. Advances in Pork Production 14:101-7.</ref>\n\nEarly veterinary studies seemed to support the use of gestation crates.

The American Association of Swine Veterinarians adopted a position statement in 2002 specifying five standards of sow welfare and concluding, \"Current scientific literature indicates that individual gestation stalls meet each of the aforementioned, provided the appropriate level of stockmanship is administered.\"<ref>\"AASV Position Statement: Pregnant Sow Housing.\" Accessed 31 July 2012.</ref>\n\n{{farming}}\n''The Washington Post'' reported in 2001 that researchers have not found sows in gestation crates to have elevated levels of [[stress hormone]]s. The paper notes that this suggests their overall health is not compromised. Some producers in Europe use a \u201cfree access\u201d maternity pen configuration in which sows are in individual pens for the first four weeks of pregnancy but can \u201cunlock\u201d the stall by backing out and entering a common area. The producers observed that pregnant pigs will stay in the individual pens more than 90 percent of the time, and return to the same stall more than 90 percent of the time.<ref name=\"Salek-Johnson\">{{cite news|last=Salek-Johnson|first=Janeen|title=Individual pens for sows' safety|url=http://thegazette.com/2012/09/30/individual-pens-for-sows-safety/|accessdate=10 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]]|date=30 September 2012}}</ref>  \n\nHowever, other veterinary studies contradict those earlier studies. A 1997 report of the Scientific Veterinary Committee of the European Union, where a gestation crate ban went into effect in 2013, noted that because \"overall welfare appears to be better when sows are not confined throughout gestation, sows should be preferably be kept in groups.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">Tim Carman, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/pork-industry-gives-sows-room-to-move/2012/05/25/gJQAISlxyU_story.html \"Pork industry gives sows room to move\"], ''The Washington Post'', 29 May 2012.</ref> Likewise in 2008, the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production, after 2.5 years of research, recommended \"the phase-out, within 10 years, of all intensive confinement systems that restrict natural movement and normal behaviors, including swine gestation crates.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>\n\nMany studies have shown that sows in crates exhibit behavior such as bar-biting, head weaving, and tongue rolling, indicating chronic frustration. When given the choice, pigs will relieve themselves far away from where they sleep and eat.<ref> {{cite journal |title=Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare on a request from the Commission related to welfare of weaners and rearing pigs: effects of different space allowances and floor types |publisher=The EFSA Journal |date=2005 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2005.268 |doi-access=free }} </ref> Sows in crates bite the bars, chew even when they have no food, and press their water bottles obsessively, all reportedly signs of boredom. The ''Post'' (uncited reference) writes that a report by veterinarians for the [[European Union]] concluded that abnormal behavior in sows \"develop[s] when the animal is severely or chronically frustrated. Hence their development indicates that the animal is having difficulty in coping and its welfare is poor.\"<ref name=Kaufmann2/> This behavior, such as bar-biting and other stereotypic behavior can also lead to other physical trauma, such as sores from frequent contact with the metal bars, and mouth sores from sham-chewing and bar-biting.<ref>Mendl MT. 1991.
