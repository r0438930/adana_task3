It descended to his grandson [[Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam]] (1745-1816) of [[Mount Merrion]], Dublin, Ireland, who named it \"FitzWilliam House\" and there formed his famous art collection and by his will founded the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] in Cambridge. The monument to Sir Matthew Decker and Richard FitzWilliam survives against the external wall of St Mary Magdalene's Church, Richmond. FitzWilliam's heir was his cousin [[George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke]] (1759-1827), of [[Wilton House]] in Wiltshire, who renamed the house \"Pembroke House\". It was demolished in 1840.<ref>[https://www.richmond.gov.uk/richmond_green_old_palace_lane_to_the_old_deer_park_gates]</ref> \nNumbers 1 to 10, Pembroke Villas are Grade II listed.<ref name=\"Pembroke Villas 1-10\">{{National Heritage List for England |num=1065319 |desc=Pembroke Villas  |accessdate=19 September 2016}}</ref> The street running along the north east of the Green, where it joins Pembroke Villas, is called Portland Terrace.

The earliest reference to cricket on Richmond Green is from a 1666 letter by [[Sir Robert Paston]], a resident of Richmond.\n\nThe Green is presently home to two [[village cricket]] teams each affiliated to two of Richmond's [[public houses|pubs]], ''The Prince's Head'' and ''The Cricketers''. Midweek matches are contested in the modern limited overs format of [[Twenty20]] usually on a Tuesday or Thursdays, where surrounding village teams compete for the Len Smith Charity Shield.\n\n==Richmond Green in art==\nTwo [[watercolours]]  by Edward Walker, made in 1942, showing nos 10, 11 and 12 Richmond Green<ref name=\"V&A 1\">{{cite web | url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O596336/nos-10-11-12-richmond-watercolour-walker/#.U-eFHvkFGTM.facebook | title=Nos 10, 11 & 12 Richmond Green, Surrey; Recording Britain | publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] | work=Search the collections | accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref> and the south side of the Green,<ref name=\"V&A 2\">{{cite web | url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O596335/south-side-of-the-green-drawing-walker/#.U-eEhbwI8d0.facebook | title=South Side of the Green, Richmond; Recording Britain | publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] | work=Search the collection | accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref> are in the [[Recording Britain]] collection at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].\n\n==Societies==\nThe Friends of Richmond Green, an amenity action group, seek to \"protect and enhance the Green for local residents, visitors and future generations\".<ref name=\"Friends\">{{cite web | url=http://www.forg.org.uk/ | title=Welcome to the Friends of Richmond Green | publisher=Friends of Richmond Green | accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=packed heights=165 class=center>\nImage:Richmond Green 5260-6s.jpg|View of the northern half of Richmond Green, showing Pembroke Villas and Portland Terrace\nFile:Splendid Victorian Houses on Richmond Green, London-5057587834.jpg|Houses on Portland Terrace\nFile:Houses_At_Richmond_Green,_London-95369622.jpg|The south corner of Richmond Green\nFile:Richmond Green, London-geograph-2621535-by-Philip-Halling.jpg|Footpaths crossing Richmond Green\nFile:North side of Richmond Green-geograph-2498025-by-Marathon.jpg| Park Gates House, in Pembroke Villas, is next to the old entrance to [[Old Deer Park]]\n</gallery>\n[[Image:Map-richmondgreen.png|thumb|right|150px|Map of Richmond Green]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Richmond Green cricket ground]]\n*[[Richmond Green United Reformed Church]]\n*[[Richmond Palace]]\n*[[Richmond Theatre]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[John Cloake |Cloake, John]] (2001).
