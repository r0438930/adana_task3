'''Sathuragiri Hills''' ({{lang|ta|சதுரகிரி}}; {{transl|ta|ISO|caturakiri}}), also known as \"Chathuragiri\" or \"Sundara Mahalingam\"<ref>https://www.sanskritimagazine.com/hindu-temples/sathuragiri-hill-chathuragiri-the-abode-of-siddhas/</ref>, is a [[pilgrimage]] site located 10&nbsp;km from [[Watrap]], near [[Srivilliputhur]], in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]] in South [[India]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sanskritimagazine.com/hindu-temples/sathuragiri-hill-chathuragiri-the-abode-of-siddhas/|title=Sathuragiri Hill (Chathuragiri) - The Abode of Siddhas|date=2018-03-13|website=Sanskriti - Hinduism and Indian Culture Website|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>

There are a few select days when the general public is permitted to visit and enter the Sathuragiri Hills. These are every [[new moon]] and [[full moon]], the days on either side of these moons, and on two [[Pradosha|Pradhosham]] dates. Visiting hours are between 6 a.m. and 4 p.m.

== Origin of the name ==
The name Sathuragiri originates from the words \"Chathur\" which means \"Four,\" \"Veda\" which means \"[Vedas]\" (ancient Hindu scriptures), and \"Giri\" which means \"Hill.\" When combined, the words mean \"the hill formed at the confluence of all the four Vedas.\" An alternative origin for the name is attributed to the fact that the hill is square-shaped and therefore known as \"Chathuragiri.\" 
In ancient times Sathuragiri was known as Udayagirinathar. In Udayagirinathar, a wealthy landlord owned a vast tract of land which was home to an ancient Shiva temple. The temple was looked after by an elderly priest. A stream (similar to the present Agaya Ganga Theertham at Sathuragiri) ran next to the temple.
Sathuragiri is known as the Abode of God. It is also known as Mahalingam Hill and \"Siddhargal bhoomi.\" The 18 [[Siddhar|Siddhars]] are said to have lived there.

[[Image:Closeup 9oclockgun.jpg|thumb|A closer view of the gun.]]

The '''9 O'Clock Gun''' is a [[cannon]] located in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, that is ordinarily fired daily at 21:00 (9&nbsp;p.m.) [[Pacific Time Zone|PT]]. From 30 March to 30 April 2020, the gun is set to fire at 19:00 (7 p.m.), in support of local health care workers during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Canada|COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ip |first1=Stephanie |title=COVID-19: Stanley Park's Nine O'Clock Gun to fire two hours earlier for health-care workers |url=https://vancouversun.com/news/covid-19-stanley-parks-nine-oclock-gun-to-fire-two-hours-earlier-for-healthcare-workers/ |accessdate=29 March 2020 |work=Vancouver Sun |publisher=Postmedia |date=29 March 2020}}</ref>

The gun is a 12-pound<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arc.id.au/Cannonballs.html|title=British Cannonball Sizes|website=arc.id.au}}</ref> [[muzzleloader|muzzle-loaded]] naval cannon, cast in [[Woolwich]], [[England]] in 1816.<ref name=\"vhist\">{{cite web | url=http://www.vancouverhistory.ca/archives_gun.htm | title=Vancouver's Nine O'Clock Gun | accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref> The crests of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and [[Henry Phipps, 1st Earl of Mulgrave]], [[Master-General of the Ordnance]] at the time the cannon was [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]], are on the barrel. Seventy-eight years later, in about 1894, it was brought to [[Stanley Park]] by the [[Department of Marine and Fisheries (Canada)|Department of Marine and Fisheries]] to warn [[fishermen]] of the 18:00 Sunday close of fishing. On October 15, 1898, the gun was fired for the first time in [[Stanley Park]] at noon.

The 21:00 firing was later established as a [[time signal]] for the general population and to allow the chronometers of ships in port to be accurately set.  The [[Brockton Point]] lighthouse keeper, William D. Jones, originally detonated a stick of dynamite over the water until the cannon was installed. The cannon is now activated automatically with an electronic trigger which was installed by the Parks Board electrical department. It is still loaded daily with a black powder charge. The fluorescent lights illuminating the gun from overhead go out exactly ten seconds before it fires, and turn back on a few seconds afterward.

The clock used to time the firing of the gun runs slightly fast, such that towards the end of each year, the gun fires up to 50 seconds before 9pm. At New Year's Day, the clock seems to be reset, and the gun goes off at 9pm again.

The 9 O'Clock Gun has been silent for at least seven periods:{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} once during [[World War II]], in 1969 when it was stolen and held by [[University of British Columbia]] Engineering students until a \"[[ransom]]\" was donated to [[BC Children's Hospital]], in 2007 during a work stoppage, in 2008 when UBC Engineering students painted it red, and on 20 May 2011, July 22, 2017, July 26, 2017, August 8, 2019, October 7, 2019, November 17, 2019, November 26, 2019 with no explanation.  After the 1969 theft, the cannon was surrounded by a stone and metal enclosure as shown in the photo.

The gun was restored and sheltered by a new pavilion designed by architect [[Gregory Henriquez]] in 1986 and built as a [[centennial]] gift to the city from [[Ebco Industries]], Chester Millar, First Generation Capital, and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].<ref name=\"vhist\"/>

In the past there was a Texaco floating gas station permanently anchored in line with the gun and in 1964 someone was able to toss rocks from the beach below into the barrel which then perforated the 'O' in the large illuminated sign above the barge.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}  The barge was moved slightly after that event.

At noon on Canada Day (1 July), three additional cannons were added to the sea wall just to the West of the 9 O'Clock Gun. These three cannons each fired seven times, resulting in a 21 gun salute.

The 9 O'Clock Gun has had its own [[Twitter]] Parody Account since May 21, 2012, in which it tweets \"BOOM!\" every day at 21:00 Pacific Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/the9oclockgun|title=Nine O'Clock Gun (@the9oclockgun) - Twitter|website=twitter.com}}</ref>

The '''9 O'Clock Gun''' is a [[cannon]] located in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, that is ordinarily shot daily at 21:00 (9&nbsp;p.m.) [[Pacific Time Zone|PT]]. From 30 March to 30 April 2020, the gun is set to fire at 19:00 (7 p.m.), in support of local health care workers during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Canada|COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ip |first1=Stephanie |title=COVID-19: Stanley Park's Nine O'Clock Gun to fire two hours earlier for health-care workers |url=https://vancouversun.com/news/covid-19-stanley-parks-nine-oclock-gun-to-fire-two-hours-earlier-for-healthcare-workers/ |accessdate=29 March 2020 |work=Vancouver Sun |publisher=Postmedia |date=29 March 2020}}</ref>

Seventy-eight years later, in about 1894, it was brought to [[Stanley Park]] by the [[Department of Marine and Fisheries (Canada)|Department of Marine and Fisheries]] to warn [[fishermen]] of the 18:00 Sunday close of fishing. On October 15, 1898, the gun was fired for the first time in [[Stanley Park]] at noon.

The 21:00 firing was later established as a [[time signal]] for the general population and to allow the chronometers of ships in port to be accurately set.  The [[Brockton Point]] lighthouse keeper, William D. Jones, originally detonated a stick of dynamite over the water until the cannon was installed. The cannon is now activated automatically with an electronic trigger which was installed by the Parks Board electrical department. It is still loaded daily with a black powder charge. The fluorescent lights illuminating the gun from overhead go out exactly ten seconds before it fires, and turn back on a few seconds afterward.

The clock used to time the firing of the gun runs slightly fast, such that towards the end of each year, the gun fires up to 50 seconds before 9pm. At New Year's Day, the clock seems to be reset, and the gun goes off at 9pm again.

'''Sathuragiri Hills''' ({{lang|ta|சதுரகிரி}}; {{transl|ta|ISO|caturakiri}}), also known as \"Chathuragiri\" or \"Sundara Mahalingam\"<ref>https://www.sanskritimagazine.com/hindu-temples/sathuragiri-hill-chathuragiri-the-abode-of-siddhas/</ref>, is a [[pilgrimage]] site located 10&nbsp;km from [[Watrap]], near [[Srivilliputhur]], in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]] in South [[India]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sanskritimagazine.com/hindu-temples/sathuragiri-hill-chathuragiri-the-abode-of-siddhas/|title=Sathuragiri Hill (Chathuragiri) - The Abode of Siddhas|date=2018-03-13|website=Sanskriti - Hinduism and Indian Culture Website|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>

There are a few select days when the general public is permitted to visit and enter the Sathuragiri Hills. These are every [[new moon]] and [[full moon]], the days on either side of these moons, and on two [[Pradosha|Pradhosham]] dates. Visiting hours are between 6 a.m. and 4 p.m.

== Origin of the name ==
The name Sathuragiri originates from the words \"Chathur\" which means \"Four,\" \"Veda\" which means \"[Vedas]\" (ancient Hindu scriptures), and \"Giri\" which means \"Hill.\" When combined, the words mean \"the hill formed at the confluence of all the four Vedas.\" An alternative origin for the name is attributed to the fact that the hill is square-shaped and therefore known as \"Chathuragiri.\" 
In ancient times Sathuragiri was known as Udayagirinathar. In Udayagirinathar, a wealthy landlord owned a vast tract of land which was home to an ancient Shiva temple. The temple was looked after by an elderly priest. A stream (similar to the present Agaya Ganga Theertham at Sathuragiri) ran next to the temple.
Sathuragiri is known as the Abode of God. It is also known as Mahalingam Hill and \"Siddhargal bhoomi.\" The 18 [[Siddhar|Siddhars]] are said to have lived there.

'''Sathuragiri Hills''' ({{lang|ta|சதுரகிரி}}; {{transl|ta|ISO|caturakiri}}), also known as \"Chathuragiri\" or \"Sundara Mahalingam\"<ref>https://www.sanskritimagazine.com/hindu-temples/sathuragiri-hill-chathuragiri-the-abode-of-siddhas/</ref>, is a [[pilgrimage]] site located 10&nbsp;km from [[Watrap]], near [[Srivilliputhur]], in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]] in South [[India]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sanskritimagazine.com/hindu-temples/sathuragiri-hill-chathuragiri-the-abode-of-siddhas/|title=Sathuragiri Hill (Chathuragiri) - The Abode of Siddhas|date=2018-03-13|website=Sanskriti - Hinduism and Indian Culture Website|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>

There are a few select days when the general public is permitted to visit and enter the Sathuragiri Hills. These are every [[new moon]] and [[full moon]], the days on either side of these moons, and on two [[Pradosha|Pradhosham]] dates. Visiting hours are between 6 a.m. and 4 p.m.

== Origin of the name ==
The name Sathuragiri originates from the words \"Chathur\" which means \"Four,\" \"Veda\" which means \"[Vedas]\" (ancient Hindu scriptures), and \"Giri\" which means \"Hill.\" When combined, the words mean \"the hill formed at the confluence of all the four Vedas.\" An alternative origin for the name is attributed to the fact that the hill is square-shaped and therefore known as \"Chathuragiri.\" 
In ancient times Sathuragiri was known as Udayagirinathar. In Udayagirinathar, a wealthy landlord owned a vast tract of land which was home to an ancient Shiva temple. The temple was looked after by an elderly priest. A stream (similar to the present Agaya Ganga Theertham at Sathuragiri) ran next to the temple.
Sathuragiri is known as the Abode of God. It is also known as Mahalingam Hill and \"Siddhargal bhoomi.\" The 18 [[Siddhar|Siddhars]] are said to have lived there.

[[Image:Self-sharpening effect.png|thumb|350px|The self-sharpening effect in ITP: due to a difference in electrical field, an ion will move faster when it comes in the previous zone, and slower when it comes in the next zone. Therefore, it will return to its own zone. Below the corresponding electrical field for each zone]]
'''Isotachophoresis''' ('''ITP''') is a technique in [[analytical chemistry]] used for selective separation and concentration of ionic [[analyte]]s. It is a form of [[electrophoresis]]; charged analytes are separated based on [[ionic mobility]], a quantity which tells how fast an [[ion]] migrates through an [[electric field]].

==Overview==
In conventional ITP separations, a discontinuous buffer system is used. The sample is introduced between a zone of fast leading [[electrolyte]] (LE) and a zone of slow terminating (or: trailing) electrolyte (TE). Usually, the LE and the TE have a common [[counterion]], but the co-ions (having charges with the same sign as the analytes of interest) are different: the LE is defined by co-ions with high [[Electrical mobility|ionic mobility]], while the TE is defined by co-ions with low ionic mobility. The analytes of interest have intermediate ionic mobility. Application of an electric potential results in a low [[Electric field|electrical field]] in the leading electrolyte and a high electrical field in the terminating electrolyte. Analyte ions situated in the TE zone will migrate faster than the surrounding TE co-ions, while analyte ions situated in the LE will migrate slower; the result is that analytes are focused at the LE/TE interface.

ITP is a displacement method: focusing ions of a certain kind displace other ions. If present in sufficient amounts, focusing analyte ions can displace all electrolyte co-ions, reaching a plateau [[concentration]]. Multiple analytes with sufficiently different ionic mobilities will form multiple plateau zones. Indeed, plateau mode ITP separations are readily recognized by stairlike profiles, each plateau of the stair representing an electrolyte or analyte zone having (from LE to TE) increasing electric fields and decreasing conductivities. In peak mode ITP, analytes amounts are insufficient to reach plateau concentrations, such analytes will focus in sharp [[normal distribution|Gaussian]]-like peaks. In peak mode ITP, analyte peaks will strongly overlap, unless so-called spacer compounds are added with intermediate ionic mobilities between those of the analytes; such spacer compounds are able to segregate adjacent analyte zones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationaldiagnostics.com/electrophoresis/article/isotachophoresis|title=Isotachophoresis {{!}} National Diagnostics|website=www.nationaldiagnostics.com|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>

A completed ITP separation is characterized by a [[dynamic equilibrium]] in which all coionic zones migrate with equal velocities. From this phenomenon ITP has obtained its name: iso = equal, ''tachos'' = speed, ''phoresis'' = migration.

Isotachophoresis is exactly equal to the steady-state-stacking step in [[Discontinuous Electrophoresis|Discontinuous electrophoresis]].<ref>(1959–1964) see Ornstein*</ref>

==Transient ITP==
A popular form of ITP is transient ITP (tITP). It alleviates the limitation of conventional ITP that it has limited separation capacity because of analyte zone overlap. In transient ITP, analytes are first concentrated by ITP, and then can be baseline separated by [[capillary zone electrophoresis|zone electrophoresis]]. Transient ITP is usually accomplished by dissolving the sample in the TE and sandwiching the sample/TE plug between LE zones - or vice versa: a sample/LE plug can also be sandwiched between TE zones. In the first case, analytes are focused at the front TE/LE interface. Meanwhile, the back of the TE plug becomes dissolved in the LE because the faster LE ions overcome the TE ions. When all of the TE ions are dissolved, the focusing process ceases and the analytes are separated according to the principles of zone electrophoresis.

tITP is nowadays more widespread than conventional ITP because it is easily implemented in [[capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) separations as a preconcentration step, making CE more sensitive while profiting from its powerful separation capacities.

Previously a private investment trust, '''English National Investment Company''' was floated on the [[London stock exchange]] in 1997 as '''ENIC plc''' and became a [[holding company]] for sports, media and leisure businesses. During the football investment boom of the mid to late 1990s it began to acquire shares in football clubs around [[Europe]] and bought stakes in Tottenham Hotspur (29.9%), [[Rangers F.C.]] (25.1%), [[SK Slavia Prague]] (96.7%), [[AEK Athens F.C.]] (47%), [[Vicenza Calcio]] (99.9%) and [[FC Basel]] (50%).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/dec/21/newsstory.sport6|title=Sugar sells for £22m as Levy steps in|work=The Guardian|date=21 December 2000}}</ref><ref>[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=875712 “Company Overview of ENIC plc,”] Bloomberg Businessweek (Retrieved 21 April 2013).</ref><ref>[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-02-942_en.htm?locale=FR Press Release “Commission closes investigation into UEFA rule on multiple ownership of football clubs,”] European Commission, Référence: IP/02/942  (27 June 2002)</ref>

As well as football clubs, ENIC also invested in other businesses, such as software company [[Autonomy Corporation|Autonomy]], retailer [[Warner Bros. Studio Stores]], gambling website [[365 Media Group|ukbetting.com]] and entertainment complex [[Church Street Station (Orlando)|Church Street Station]].

In 2001 ENIC bought a controlling stake in [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.]] from [[Alan Sugar]] and Levy became [[chairman]] of the club. Later in 2001, ENIC's listing was transferred from the main stock exchange to the [[Alternative Investment Market|AIM index]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://citywire.co.uk/money/enic-to-move-down-to-aim/a221531|title=ENIC to move down to AIM|publisher=City Wire|date=29 March 2001}}</ref>

[[Faroe Islands Premier League Football]] in the 2006 season.

[[EB/Streymur]] were top of the league throughout most of the season, with [[Havnar Bóltfelag|HB Tórshavn]], [[B36 Tórshavn]] and [[NSÍ Runavík]] staying in contention. With 4 matches left to play, EB/Streymur were 7 points ahead of second placed HB, but after 1 draw and 1 loss for EB/Streymur, HB managed to reduce that lead by 2 points by winning twice. By this time B36, KÍ and NSÍ were out of the title race. With one match left to play, HB Tórshavn's only chance of securing the title was if EB/Streymur lost to [[KÍ Klaksvík]]. In addition to that, HB had to win their match against [[ÍF]]. But as both matches were locked in stalemates and time was ebbing out, EB/Streymur were on the way to winning the title. 
But then, 82 minutes into the match between EB/Streymur and KÍ, events took a dramatic twist, as Paul Clapson put KÍ 1-0 up against EB/Streymur with a long range effort. But EB/Streymur were still champions at this stage, because HB didn't seem to be able to capitalize on the golden opportunity given by EB/Streymur and KÍ. 

88 minutes had gone in the match between HB and ÍF, and still HB hadn't scored the crucial goal that would hand them the title. But in a last desperate effort, HB's central defender [[Vagnur Mohr Mortensen]] joined the attack. A long high ball was sent into ÍF's penalty area on the left where Vagnur headed the ball over a stranded goalkeeper and into the goal for a 1-0 lead and, more importantly, secured HB the 2006 championship title. Deep into stoppage time, [[Rógvi Jacobsen]] added another and HB won 2-0.

[[Faroe Islands Premier League Football]] in the 2006 season.

[[EB/Streymur]] were top of the league throughout most of the season, with [[Havnar Bóltfelag|HB Tórshavn]], [[B36 Tórshavn]] and [[NSÍ Runavík]] staying in contention. With 4 matches left to play, EB/Streymur were 7 points ahead of second placed HB, but after 1 draw and 1 loss for EB/Streymur, HB managed to reduce that lead by 2 points by winning twice. By this time B36, KÍ and NSÍ were out of the title race. With one match left to play, HB Tórshavn's only chance of securing the title was if EB/Streymur lost to [[KÍ Klaksvík]]. In addition to that, HB had to win their match against [[ÍF]]. But as both matches were locked in stalemates and time was ebbing out, EB/Streymur were on the way to winning the title. 
But then, 82 minutes into the match between EB/Streymur and KÍ, events took a dramatic twist, as Paul Clapson put KÍ 1-0 up against EB/Streymur with a long range effort. But EB/Streymur were still champions at this stage, because HB didn't seem to be able to capitalize on the golden opportunity given by EB/Streymur and KÍ. 

88 minutes had gone in the match between HB and ÍF, and still HB hadn't scored the crucial goal that would hand them the title. But in a last desperate effort, HB's central defender [[Vagnur Mohr Mortensen]] joined the attack. A long high ball was sent into ÍF's penalty area on the left where Vagnur headed the ball over a stranded goalkeeper and into the goal for a 1-0 lead and, more importantly, secured HB the 2006 championship title. Deep into stoppage time, [[Rógvi Jacobsen]] added another and HB won 2-0.

== Work ==

=== Poetry ===
Couzyn's first collection was titled ''Flying'' (1970). Later collections include ''Christmas in Africa'' (1975), ''A Time to be Born'' (1981), ''Life by Drowning: Selected poems'' (1985), and ''That's It'' (1993).<ref name= S145>Stringer p. 145</ref>

''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Literature in English'' remarks that Couzyn's poetry repeatedly engages the social, political and imaginative implications of womanhood.

The ''Oxford Companion'' observes that her conception of poetry as pre-eminently oral gives much of her work clarity and immediacy.<ref name= S145/><ref name = P183>Papke p. 183</ref>

=== Anthologies ===
Couzyn edited the influential ''[[Bloodaxe Books#Women poets|The Bloodaxe Book of Contemporary Women Poets]]'' (1985), set as an [[A-level]] text in British schools at the time.

'''Kira Maria Asenina''' ({{lang-bg|Кира-Мария Асенина}}) was a [[Bulgaria]]n [[princess]] and [[empress consort]] ([[tsarina]]), second wife of [[George I of Bulgaria]]. She was the daughter of [[tsar]] [[Mitso Asen of Bulgaria]] and his wife [[Maria Asenina of Bulgaria|Maria]]. The dates and the places of her birth and death are unknown.

== History ==
Through her mother, Kira Maria was a granddaughter of [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]] and [[Irene Komnene of Epirus]]. She was also the sister of tsar [[Ivan Asen III]], who seized the [[Bulgaria]]n throne in 1280 with Byzantine support.

She married the Bulgaro-[[Cumans|Cuman]] nobleman [[George I of Bulgaria|George Terter]] in a marriage arranged by her brother in order to strengthen his position. George divorced his first wife, [[Maria Terter|Maria]], and sent her and their son, [[Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria|Theodore Svetoslav]], as hostages to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. He was accordingly made a ''[[despotēs]]'', the highest rank in the Byzantino-Bulgarian court hierarchy, and Kira Maria was granted the title of ''despoina''.

Ivan Asen III failed to assert himself throughout the country and he secretly fled [[Tarnovo]] in 1280 and escaped to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. George Terter seized the throne and Kira Maria was proclaimed the new ''[[tsarina]]''.

However, she was very unpopular in [[Tarnovo]], because of her deposed brother. Her marriage also proved to be controversial as Maria Terter was still alive in [[Constantinople]]. According to the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] George's first marriage was still valid and Kira Maria was his uncanonical wife. [[Patriarch]] [[Joachim III of Bulgaria|Yoakim III of Bulgaria]] threatened to excommunicate the couple and insisted that he would not relent until George I Terter put away Kira Maria. The tsar re-opened negotiations with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and sought the return of Maria, what he eventually accomplished in a treaty in which Maria and Kira Maria exchanged places as empress and hostage.

== Children ==
According to [[Georgius Pachymeres]] [[Ana Terter]], wife of [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian king]] [[Stefan Uroš II Milutin of Serbia|Stefan Uroš II Milutin]], was the daughter of Kira Maria and George Terter.<ref>Georgius Pachymeres.

'''Kira Maria Asenina''' ({{lang-bg|Кира-Мария Асенина}}) was a [[Bulgaria]]n [[princess]] and [[empress consort]] ([[tsarina]]), second wife of [[George I of Bulgaria]]. She was the daughter of [[tsar]] [[Mitso Asen of Bulgaria]] and his wife [[Maria Asenina of Bulgaria|Maria]]. The dates and the places of her birth and death are unknown.

== History ==
Through her mother, Kira Maria was a granddaughter of [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]] and [[Irene Komnene of Epirus]]. She was also the sister of tsar [[Ivan Asen III]], who seized the [[Bulgaria]]n throne in 1280 with Byzantine support.

She married the Bulgaro-[[Cumans|Cuman]] nobleman [[George I of Bulgaria|George Terter]] in a marriage arranged by her brother in order to strengthen his position. George divorced his first wife, [[Maria Terter|Maria]], and sent her and their son, [[Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria|Theodore Svetoslav]], as hostages to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. He was accordingly made a ''[[despotēs]]'', the highest rank in the Byzantino-Bulgarian court hierarchy, and Kira Maria was granted the title of ''despoina''.

Ivan Asen III failed to assert himself throughout the country and he secretly fled [[Tarnovo]] in 1280 and escaped to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. George Terter seized the throne and Kira Maria was proclaimed the new ''[[tsarina]]''.

However, she was very unpopular in [[Tarnovo]], because of her deposed brother. Her marriage also proved to be controversial as Maria Terter was still alive in [[Constantinople]]. According to the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] George's first marriage was still valid and Kira Maria was his uncanonical wife. [[Patriarch]] [[Joachim III of Bulgaria|Yoakim III of Bulgaria]] threatened to excommunicate the couple and insisted that he would not relent until George I Terter put away Kira Maria. The tsar re-opened negotiations with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and sought the return of Maria, what he eventually accomplished in a treaty in which Maria and Kira Maria exchanged places as empress and hostage.

== Children ==
According to [[Georgius Pachymeres]] [[Ana Terter]], wife of [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian king]] [[Stefan Uroš II Milutin of Serbia|Stefan Uroš II Milutin]], was the daughter of Kira Maria and George Terter.<ref>Georgius Pachymeres.

'''''Sub Battle Simulator''''' is a naval combat [[simulation game]] released by [[Epyx]] in 1987. The game was developed by Digital Illusions, Inc. It was released for the [[Amiga]], [[Apple II]], [[Apple IIGS]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari ST]], [[Macintosh]], [[MS-DOS]], and the [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Tandy Color Computer 3]].

==Description==
''Sub Battle Simulator'' sets the action in times of World War 2, with the player on the American or German side. There are 36 German missions and 24 American missions in which the player can command six different submarines. The player is responsible for navigation, using five different levels of mapping, attacks' planning based on weather and surroundings as well as paying attention to the radar. The game gives the possibility to play underwater or on the surface. A player can choose target practice, individual missions or war commands as either a German or an American submarine Captain.

==Reception==
Game reviewers Hartley and Pattie Lesser complimented the game in their \"The Role of Computers\" column in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #122 (1987), calling it \"the finest of the submarine simulation games\" and stating \"This is a real winner for wargaming enthusiasts!\"<ref name=\"Dragon122\">{{cite journal
