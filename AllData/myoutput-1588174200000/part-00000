His most famous invention was the [[snowmobile]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Valcourt (city), Quebec|Valcourt]], Quebec, Joseph-Armand Bombardier dabbled in mechanics from an early age. He acquired experience by reading, taking notes and repairing what he found until he opened his own garage at age 19, where he would repair cars and sell gasoline in the summertime.\n\nDuring wintertime, he worked on developing a vehicle able to travel on snow. At that time, the Quebec government did not clear snow from secondary roads, so residents of these areas stored their cars for the winter season. The idea to build a winter vehicle came to Bombardier after a blizzard in which his young son fell ill of [[peritonitis]] and died because he could not be brought to the nearest hospital.\n\nThe first B7 (B for Bombardier and 7 for 7 passengers) snowmobiles were sold during the winter of 1936\u201337 and were well received. A new plant able to produce more than 200 vehicles a year was built in 1940. A new 12-passenger model was made available in 1941, but demand was halted when Canada entered [[World War II]]. Bombardier offered his expertise to the Canadian government and started producing specialized military vehicles for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].\n\nAfter the war, business declined when the Quebec government began clearing snow from secondary roads in 1948. Bombardier went on to build smaller snowmobiles during the 1950s and developed a new market for recreational products for one or two people. Bombardier died in 1964 of cancer but the snowmobile idea was a success and more than 8200 units were sold annually. he is a human\n\n==Honours==\nIn 2004, [[Quebec Autoroute 55|Autoroute 55]] in Quebec was named ''{{lang|fr-CA|autoroute Joseph-Armand-Bombardier}}'' between [[Stanstead, Quebec|Stanstead]] and [[Quebec Autoroute 20|Autoroute 20]] (''{{lang|fr-CA|autoroute Jean-Lesage}}'') near [[Drummondville]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/pdf/joseph_armand_bombardier.pdf\n |title       = Hommage \u00e0 Joseph-Armand Bombardier\n |publisher   = gouv.qc.ca\n |accessdate  = 2009-04-03\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091007171928/http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/pdf/joseph_armand_bombardier.pdf\n |archivedate = 2009-10-07\n}}</ref> The [[Bombardier Glacier]] in [[Antarctica]] is also named after him.\n\nIn 2000, Joseph-Armand Bombardier was honoured by the [[government of Canada]] with his image on a [[List of people on stamps of Canada|postage stamp]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&lang=eng&rec_nbr=2266912&rec_nbr_list=2266912|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307093419/http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&lang=eng&rec_nbr=2266912&rec_nbr_list=2266912|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-03-07|title=Joseph-Armand Bombardier: Getting Around in the Winter|work=Library and Archives Canada}}</ref>\n\nHe is a member of the [[Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"CSEHoF-hall\">[http://sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/about/hallfame/u_m_e.cfm The Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame: The Hall] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109201033/http://sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/about/hallfame/u_m_e.cfm |date=2014-11-09 }}, Canada Science and Technology Museum.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bombardier Recreational Products]]\n*[[Snowmobile|Ski-doo]]\n*[[Roski]], a division founded by Joseph-Armand Bombardier\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book| title=Joseph-Armand Bombardier: An Inventor's Dream Come True| last=Lacasse |first=Roger| year=1988| publisher=Libre expression| isbn=2-89111-341-1}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bombardiermuseum.com/  J.
