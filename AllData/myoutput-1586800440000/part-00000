The Group believes that it benefits from lower operating costs compared to other hydro power generation companies in part due to the geographic location, scale and efficient management of the power generating assets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/638e1dc6-1bb2-11e7-bcac-6d03d067f81f|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=24 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nEn+ Group's Energy segment is a member of the Global Sustainable Electricity Partnership, a non-profit organisation whose members are the world's leading electricity companies, supplying energy to over 1.2 billion customers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalelectricity.org/members/eurosibenergo-ese/|title=EuroSibEnergo (ESE)|website=GSEP|language=en-US|access-date=24 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, En+ Group produced 68.4TWh of electricity and 26.7mn Gcal of heat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enplus.ru/upload/iblock/f39/f39a6115f1afe4f4305168831115bec9.pdf|title=En+ 2017 Operational results}}</ref>\n\n==== Key assets of the En+ Group Energy segment ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+style=\"text-align: left\"|Hydropower plants\n!Country\n!Name\n!Location\n!Start of operations\n!'''Installed capacity, MW'''\n|-\n|{{flag|Russia}}\n|[[Krasnoyarsk Dam|Krasnoyarsk HPP]]\n|[[Divnogorsk]]\n|1972 \u2014\n|6000\n|-\n|{{flag|Russia}}\n|[[Bratsk Hydroelectric Power Station|Bratsk HPP]]\n|[[Bratsk]]\n|1966 \u2014\n|4500\n|-\n|{{flag|Russia}}\n|[[Ust-Ilimsk Hydroelectric Power Station|Ust-Ilimsk HPP]]\u00a0 \u00a0\n|[[Ust-Ilimsk]]\u00a0 \u00a0\n|1980 \u2014\n|3840\n|-\n|{{flag|Russia}}\n|[[Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station|Irkutsk HPP]]\n|[[Irkutsk]]\n|1956 \u2014\n|662\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+style=\"text-align: left\"|Combined heat plants\n!Country\n!Name\n!Location\n!Start of operations\n!'''Installed capacity, MW'''\n|-\n|{{flag|Russia}}\n|CHP-10\n|Angarsk\n|1959\n|1100\n|-\n|{{flag|Russia}}\n|CHP-9\n|Angarsk\n|1963\n|540\n|-\n|{{flag|Russia}}\n|Novo-Irkutsk CHP\n|Irkutsk\n|1975\n|708\n|-\n|{{flag|Russia}}\n|Ust-Ilimsk CHP\u00a0 \u00a0\n|Ust-Ilimsk\u00a0 \u00a0\n|1978\n|515\n|-\n|{{flag|Russia}}\n|CHP-11\n|Usolye-Sibirskoye\n|1959\n|350\n|-\n|{{flag|Russia}}\n|CHP-6\n|Bratsk\n|1965\n|270\n|-\n|{{flag|Russia}}\n|Novo-Ziminskaya CHP\u00a0 \u00a0\n|Sayansk\n|1980\n|260\n|-\n|{{flag|Russia}}\n|Avtozavodskaya CHP\u00a0 \u00a0\n|Nizhny Novgorod\u00a0 \u00a0\n|1931\n|580\n|}\n== Renewables ==\n\nIn 2015 En+ Group commenced the operations of the Abakan solar power plant.
