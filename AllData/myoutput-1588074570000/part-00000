It is a [[deciduous]] [[tree]] that bears a [[pome]] [[fruit]], similar in appearance to a pear, and bright golden-yellow when mature. Throughout history the cooked fruit has been used as food, but the tree is also grown for its attractive pale pink blossoms and other ornamental qualities.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Quince (10928s).jpg|thumb|left|Halved quince, with seeds and [[food browning|oxidation]] visible]]\nThe tree grows {{convert|5|to|8|m|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|4|to|6|m|abbr=on}} wide. The fruit is {{convert|70|to|120|mm|abbr=on|0}} long and {{convert|60|to|90|mm|abbr=on|0}} across.\n\nThe immature fruit is green with dense grey-white fine hair, most of which rubs off before maturity in late autumn when the fruit changes colour to yellow with hard, strongly perfumed flesh. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternately arranged, simple, {{convert|60|-|110|mm|in|abbr=on|0}} long, with an entire margin and densely pubescent with fine white hairs. The [[flower]]s, produced in spring after the leaves, are white or pink, {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on|0}} across, with five petals.\n\nThe seeds contain [[nitrile]]s, which are common in the seeds of [[Rosaceae|the rose family]].  In the stomach, enzymes or stomach acid or both cause some of the nitriles to be [[hydrolysis reaction|hydrolysed]] and produce [[hydrogen cyanide]], which is a volatile gas. The seeds are only likely to be toxic if a large quantity is eaten.<ref name=pfaf>{{cite web|url=http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Cydonia%20oblonga|title=Cydonia oblonga Quince PFAF Plant Database|work=pfaf.org}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nFour other species previously included in the genus ''Cydonia'' are now treated in separate [[genera]]. These are ''[[Pseudocydonia|Pseudocydonia sinensis]]'' and the three flowering quinces of eastern Asia in the genus ''Chaenomeles''. Another unrelated fruit, the [[Aegle marmelos|bael]], is sometimes called the \"Bengal quince\".\n\nThe modern name originated in the 14th century as a plural of ''quoyn'', via [[Old French]] ''cooin'' from [[Latin]] ''cotoneum malum'' / ''cydonium malum'', ultimately from [[Classical Greek language|Greek]] \u03ba\u03c5\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03bc\u1fc6\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, ''kydonion melon'' \"[[Kydonia]]n apple\".\n\n''Cydonia'' is included in the subfamily [[Amygdaloideae]].<ref name=Potter>Potter, D., et al.

It was cultivated from an archaic period around the Mediterranean. The Greeks associated it with [[Kydonia|Cydonia]] on Crete, as the \"Cydonian [[Pome (botany)|pome]]\", and [[Theophrastus]], in his ''Enquiry into Plants'', noted that quince was one of many fruiting plants that do not come true from seed.<ref>Theophrastus: \"Quince produces wild quince\" ''Enquiry'' ii.2.5</ref> As a sacred emblem of [[Aphrodite]], a quince figured in a lost poem of [[Callimachus]] that survives in a prose epitome: seeing his beloved in the courtyard of the temple of Aphrodite, Acontius plucks a quince from the \"orchard of Aphrodite\", inscribes its skin and furtively rolls it at the feet of her illiterate nurse, whose curiosity aroused, hands it to the girl to read aloud, and the girl finds herself saying \"I swear by Aphrodite that I will marry Acontius\".

It may also affect other Rosaceae plants such as [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] and [[medlar]], but is typically less damaging than on quince.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=745 |title=Quince leaf blight |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |year=2016 |access-date=22 November 2016}}</ref> Cedar-quince rust, caused by ''[[Gymnosporangium clavipes]]'', requires two hosts to complete the fungal life cycle, one being a cedar (most commonly a juniper, ''[[Juniperus virginiana]]'') and the other a rosacea. Appearing as red excrescence on various parts of the plant, it may affect quinces grown in vicinity of junipers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/pests-and-problems/diseases/rusts/cedar-quince-rust.aspx |title=Cedar-Quince Rust |publisher=RMissouri Botanical Garden |year=2016 |access-date=22 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Cultivation ==\nQuince is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub which adapts to many soils of low to medium [[pH]]. It tolerates both shade and sun, but sunlight is required in order to produce larger flowers and ensure fruit ripening. It is an incredibly tough plant that does not require much maintenance, and tolerates years without pruning or major insect and disease problems.<ref name=Cumo2013/>\n\nQuince is cultivated on all continents in warm-temperate and temperate climates. It requires a cooler period of the year, with temperatures under {{convert|7|C}}, to flower properly. Propagation is done by [[cutting (plant)|cutting]]s or [[layering]]; the former method produces better plants, but they take longer to mature than by the latter. Named cultivars are propagated by cuttings or layers [[grafted]] on quince [[rootstock]]. Propagation by seed is not used commercially. Quince forms thick bushes, which must be pruned and reduced into a single stem in order to grow fruit-bearing trees for commercial use. The tree is [[self-pollination|self-pollinated]], but it produces better yields when [[cross-pollination|cross-pollinated]].<ref name=Cumo2013/>\n\nFruits are typically left on the tree to ripen fully. In warmer climates, it may become soft to the point of being edible, but additional ripening may be required in cooler climates. They are harvested in late autumn, before first frosts.<ref name=Cumo2013/>\n\nQuince is also used as rootstock for certain [[pear]] cultivars.<ref name=Cumo2013/> The resultant [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]] is called + ''Pirocydonia danielii''.\n\nIn Europe, quinces are commonly grown in central and southern areas where the summers are sufficiently hot for the fruit to fully ripen. They are not grown in large amounts; typically one or two quince trees are grown in a mixed orchard with several apples and other fruit trees. In the 18th-century New England colonies, for example, there was always a quince at the lower corner of the vegetable garden, Ann Leighton notes in records of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]] and [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]].<ref>Leighton 1986:243.</ref> [[Charlemagne]] directed that quinces be planted in well-stocked orchards. Quinces in England are first recorded in about 1275, when Edward I had some planted at the Tower of London.<ref name=hughfearnleywhittingstall>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/07/quince-recipes-hugh-fearnley-whittingstall|title=Quince recipes - Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall|author=Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall|work=the Guardian}}</ref>\n\n== Cultivars ==\n\n{|\n|- valign=top\n|\n*'Aromatnaya'\n*'Bereczki'\n*'Champion'\n*'Cooke's Jumbo' (syn.

It was cultivated from an archaic period around the Mediterranean. The Greeks associated it with [[Kydonia|Cydonia]] on Crete, as the \"Cydonian [[Pome (botany)|pome]]\", and [[Theophrastus]], in his ''Enquiry into Plants'', noted that quince was one of many fruiting plants that do not come true from seed.<ref>Theophrastus: \"Quince produces wild quince\" ''Enquiry'' ii.2.5</ref> As a sacred emblem of [[Aphrodite]], a quince figured in a lost poem of [[Callimachus]] that survives in a prose epitome: seeing his beloved in the courtyard of the temple of Aphrodite, Acontius plucks a quince from the \"orchard of Aphrodite\", inscribes its skin and furtively rolls it at the feet of her illiterate nurse, whose curiosity aroused, hands it to the girl to read aloud, and the girl finds herself saying \"I swear by Aphrodite that I will marry Acontius\". A vow thus spoken in the goddess's ''[[temenos]]'' cannot be broken.<ref>Marilyn B.

It may also affect other Rosaceae plants such as [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] and [[medlar]], but is typically less damaging than on quince.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=745 |title=Quince leaf blight |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |year=2016 |access-date=22 November 2016}}</ref> Cedar-quince rust, caused by ''[[Gymnosporangium clavipes]]'', requires two hosts to complete the fungal life cycle, one being a cedar (most commonly a juniper, ''[[Juniperus virginiana]]'') and the other a rosacea.

It tolerates both shade and sun, but sunlight is required in order to produce larger flowers and ensure fruit ripening. It is an incredibly tough plant that does not require much maintenance, and tolerates years without pruning or major insect and disease problems.<ref name=Cumo2013/>\n\nQuince is cultivated on all continents in warm-temperate and temperate climates. It requires a cooler period of the year, with temperatures under {{convert|7|C}}, to flower properly. Propagation is done by [[cutting (plant)|cutting]]s or [[layering]]; the former method produces better plants, but they take longer to mature than by the latter. Named cultivars are propagated by cuttings or layers [[grafted]] on quince [[rootstock]]. Propagation by seed is not used commercially. Quince forms thick bushes, which must be pruned and reduced into a single stem in order to grow fruit-bearing trees for commercial use. The tree is [[self-pollination|self-pollinated]], but it produces better yields when [[cross-pollination|cross-pollinated]].<ref name=Cumo2013/>\n\nFruits are typically left on the tree to ripen fully. In warmer climates, it may become soft to the point of being edible, but additional ripening may be required in cooler climates. They are harvested in late autumn, before first frosts.<ref name=Cumo2013/>\n\nQuince is also used as rootstock for certain [[pear]] cultivars.<ref name=Cumo2013/> The resultant [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]] is called + ''Pirocydonia danielii''.\n\nIn Europe, quinces are commonly grown in central and southern areas where the summers are sufficiently hot for the fruit to fully ripen. They are not grown in large amounts; typically one or two quince trees are grown in a mixed orchard with several apples and other fruit trees. In the 18th-century New England colonies, for example, there was always a quince at the lower corner of the vegetable garden, Ann Leighton notes in records of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]] and [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]].<ref>Leighton 1986:243.</ref> [[Charlemagne]] directed that quinces be planted in well-stocked orchards. Quinces in England are first recorded in about 1275, when Edward I had some planted at the Tower of London.<ref name=hughfearnleywhittingstall>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/07/quince-recipes-hugh-fearnley-whittingstall|title=Quince recipes - Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall|author=Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall|work=the Guardian}}</ref>\n\n== Cultivars ==\n\n{|\n|- valign=top\n|\n*'Aromatnaya'\n*'Bereczki'\n*'Champion'\n*'Cooke's Jumbo' (syn.
