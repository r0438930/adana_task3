The station is currently owned by [[iHeartMedia, Inc.]] and the [[broadcast license]] is held by Clear Channel Broadcasting Licenses, Inc.  WRGV broadcasts an [[urban contemporary]] music format to the greater Pensacola, Florida, and [[Mobile, Alabama]], area.  Its studios are located inside the building of unrelated television station [[WKRG]] on Broadcast Drive in Mobile, and the transmitter is near [[Robertsdale, Alabama]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1976, 107.3 FM belonged to '''WAJB-FM''', which was a beautiful music station with studios at the Tiger Point Country Club in Gulf Breeze, until it was purchased by Colonial Broadcasting in 1979.  The format was changed to [[country music]] along with new call letters, '''WOWW-FM''' to become known as \"WOW 107\", moving its studios to Davis Highway in Pensacola.\n\nAs the 1980s progressed, \"WOW 107\" would rise up to become a country music power house, overthrowing the heritage country station in the market, WXBM-FM, and winning several ''Billboard'' Magazine's Station of the Year (small market) awards.  It was also known for its full-time News department, winner of multiple AP news awards.\n\nAs the 1980s ended, so did WOW 107's run of being a ratings king, now owned by Sun Media Group.  The 1990s saw several re-imaging attempts, including \"The New WOW 107.3\" and \"107 Thunder Country\", until its demise as a country station in 1995 when it became \"New Rock One Zero Seven\", flipping to [[alternative rock]]. Riding the popularity wave of mid-1990s Alternative Music, WOWW debuted at #1 in Arbitron's Persons 18-34, where it remained until the purchase and format flip by Paxson. New Rock 107 staff included Steve Williams, OM/AM Drive, Program Director Joel Sampson, PM Drive, Music Director LaLaine and Suzy Boe among others.\n\nIn 1996, the station was purchased by Southern Broadcasting, which owned New Rock 107's only competition, [[WTKX-FM|WTKX]], \"TK101\".  Two months later, both were purchased by [[Paxson Communications]].  After the Paxson purchase, TK101, being a heritage rock station since the mid-1970s, brought over WOWW's PD Joel Sampson, retained Midday personality Mark \"the Shark\" Dyba and added a majority of WOWW air staff and re-imaged itself as \"The Rock Station\", dropping the moniker \"The New Rock Alternative\", leaving WOWW without an airstaff or a format.\n\nAfter stunting for two days playing \"[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]\" non-stop, WOWW changed formats to [[oldies]] from the 1950s and 1960s, and changed its call letters to '''WYCL''' (think \"Way Cool\").  As time went on, they phased out the 1950s music to include more 1970s songs.\n\n[[Image:My10732.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A billboard in downtown Pensacola advertising the change in format.]]\nThen in late 2004, the station's owner, now [[iHeartMedia, Inc.]] (formerly Clear Channel Communications), switched the music format to \"My 107.3\" and played 1970s and 1980s music.  However, the \"My 70s, My 80s\" positioner was discontinued and the station used \"My Variety\" as its main positioner, in order to include a slightly wider variety of music.  The playlist remained mostly 1970s and early 1980s, with a fair amount of 1960s and other 1980s songs, making it a basic [[classic hits]] format.\n\nFor three years after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the station played breaking news bulletins every hour on top of the hour (first provided by [[ABC News]], then by Clear Channel Worldwide News), as well as \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" at the start and close of each workday.\n\n[[File:WRGV 107.3KissFM logo.png|thumb|Kiss FM logo, 2015-2017]]\nIn February 2010, the station ceased the \"My 107.3\" format and started airing the format of their [[sister station]], \"Lite Mix 99.9\". On February 26, 2010, at 8:00&nbsp;a.m. WYCL launched a new [[rhythmic adult contemporary]] format branded as \"107.3 The Groove\". The first song on The Groove was \"[[Into the Groove]]\" by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. On March 5, 2010, WYCL changed their call letters to '''WRGV''' to go with \"The Groove\" branding. After a year as a Rhythmic AC, WRGV evolved to Rhythmic Top 40 in April 2011. On September 2, 2011 WRGV changed their format to [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40 (CHR)]], branded as \"107.3 Hit Music Now\". It features the syndicated Elvis Duran Morning Show and former WABB staffers Reid and Matt McCoy. On July 20, 2015 WRGV rebranded as \"107.3 Kiss FM\".<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/93773/wrgv-relaunches-as-107-3-kiss-fm/ WRGV Relaunches as 107.3 Kiss FM]</ref>\n\nOn December 8, 2017 at 5 PM, after playing \"[[1-800-273-8255 (song)|1-800-273-8255]]\" by [[Logic (musician)|Logic]], 107.3 adopted W262BL/WMXC-HD2's urban contemporary format as \"107.3 The Beat\".
