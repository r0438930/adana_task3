''Tucker''{{'}}s [[main battery]] consisted of five [[Dual-purpose gun|dual-purpose]] [[38 caliber 5-inch (127 mm) guns]].\n\nFirst assigned to the [[United States Battle Fleet]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]], ''Tucker'' operated along the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. After participating in [[naval exercise]]s in the [[Caribbean Sea]], she returned to duty in [[Territory of Hawaii|Hawaii]]. She then went on a goodwill tour to New Zealand, returning to Hawaii and docking at [[Pearl Harbor]]. When the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7{{nbsp}}December 1941, ''Tucker'' was undergoing an overhaul and was not attacked. Soon afterward, she began escorting convoys between the West Coast and Hawaii. ''Tucker'' was then tasked with escort duty to islands in the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]].\n\n''Tucker'' steamed out of port on 1 August 1942, escorting a [[cargo ship]] to [[Espiritu Santo]].

(The source, Hodges and Friedman, do not indicate if ''Tucker'' was refitted). {{sfn|Hodges|Friedman|1979|p=145}}\n\n==Construction and service history==\n\n''Tucker'' was the second vessel to be named for [[Samuel Tucker]], who had been an officer in the [[Continental Navy]] and the United States Navy.{{sfn|Parkin|1996|p=67}} ''Tucker''{{'}}s [[keel]] was laid down on 15{{nbsp}}August 1934. She was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 26{{nbsp}}February 1936 and [[Ceremonial ship launching|christened]] by a third cousin of Tucker. The ship was commissioned in the United States Navy on 23{{nbsp}}July, with [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] George T. Howard in command.{{sfn|Parkin|1996|p=68-69}}\n\n[[File:USS Tucker.jpg|thumb|alt=Naval warship rigged with sails|''Tucker'' rigged with sails, June 1940]]\nAfter her [[shakedown cruise]], she joined destroyer forces attached to the United States Battle Fleet in [[San Diego]], [[California]]. She operated with them along the West Coast and in the Hawaiian islands as part of Destroyer Squadron{{nbsp}}3 of the Destroyer Division.\nIn February 1939, she took part in [[Fleet Problem&nbsp;XX]], a naval exercise held in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean and observed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. As tensions with Japan increased, the fleet was ordered to return to Hawaiian waters.{{sfn|NHHC}}\n\nIn June 1940, ''Tucker'' steamed from Hawaii to a location east of [[Wake Island]] for fleet exercises. In ''United States Navy Destroyers of World War II,'' John Reilly, Jr. described the uncommon method used to power the vessel on its return to Hawaii: {{blockquote|... Tucker stretched her fuel supply by rigging Sails. Her homemade [[foresail]] and [[mainsail]] moved Tucker at an estimated 3.4 knots, letting her maintain [[Glossary of nautical terms#steerageway|steerageway]] as she loitered on station several days.{{sfn|Reilly|1983|p=30}}}}\n\n''Tucker'' continued operating between Hawaii and the West Coast into February 1941. She then set course for New Zealand on a goodwill tour, arriving in [[Auckland]] on 17 March. Returning to Pearl Harbor, she took part in routine exercises at sea before returning to her homeport of San Diego on 19{{nbsp}}September. After a short stay, ''Tucker'' steamed to Hawaii in November as part of Task Force{{nbsp}}19, operating again in the Hawaiian Islands. Shortly afterward, she put into Pearl Harbor for an overhaul by a [[destroyer tender]].{{sfn|NHHC}}\n\nWhen the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, ''Tucker'' was one of five destroyers moored at berth X\u20139, East Loch, alongside the destroyer tender {{USS|Whitney|AD-4|2}}.{{sfn|Roscoe|1953|pp=47\u201348}} Even before ''Tucker''{{'}}s [[general quarters]] alarm could be sounded, one of her on-deck sailors began firing a 50-caliber machine gun at the first wave of Japanese aircraft. When the second wave attacked, every ship that could opened fire. ''Tucker''{{'}}s gunners scored hits on at least two aircraft: one crashed in a cane field, another in flames disappeared over a mountaintop. Still undergoing overhaul, much of ''Tucker''\u2019s machinery had been torn down for repairs. Despite the crew's efforts, she was unable to get [[underway]] until that evening.{{sfn|Parkin|1996|p=68}}\n\nAfter her overhaul, ''Tucker'' patrolled off Pearl Harbor and spent several months escorting convoys between Hawaii and the West Coast. With new orders, she steamed to the South Pacific for convoy duty. ''Tucker'' then escorted the [[seaplane tender]] {{USS|Wright|AV-1|2}} to [[Tutuila]], [[American Samoa]], as part of the drive to fortify outposts. She then escorted her charge to [[Suva]], [[British Fiji|Fiji]], and proceeded to [[Noumea]], [[New Caledonia]]. Steaming on for Australia, she arrived at [[Sydney]] on 27{{nbsp}}April. After taking on fuel, she visited [[Melbourne]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] before steaming back to Sydney. ''Tucker'' and  ''Wright'' returned to Suva, arriving on 3{{nbsp}}June 1942. For the remainder of June and into the first week of July, ''Tucker'' operated out of Suva before relieving the cruiser {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}} of convoy escort duties on 10{{nbsp}}July. On{{nbsp}}30 July, the ship arrived at Auckland and the following day started back for Suva.{{sfn|NHHC}}\n\n==Fate==\n[[Image:DD-374 sunk 5Aug1942 EspirituSanto NAN09-10-86.jpg|thumb|alt=Naval ship struck by a mine and sinking|USS ''Tucker'' (D-374) sinking south of Espiritu Santo,  5 August 1942]]\n\nOn 1{{nbsp}}August 1942 ''Tucker'' left Suva, escorting the cargo ship SS ''Nira Luckenbach'' to [[Espiritu Santo]], [[New Hebrides]].{{sfn|NHHC}} On 4{{nbsp}}August ''Tucker'' led the cargo ship into the harbor at Espiritu Santo, as she headed into the western entrance, she struck at least one [[Naval mine|mine]]. The explosion tore her hull nearly in two at the [[Funnel (ship)|No.{{nbsp}}1 stack]], killing all three crew members on watch in the forward [[fire room]]. The rest of the ship's company survived.\n''Nira Luckenbach'' and other vessels rescued sailors from their sinking ship.

An investigation revealed that ''Tucker's'' captain had not been informed of the minefield.{{sfn|Rohwer|2005|p=184}} She was stricken from the ''[[Naval Vessel Register]]'' on 2{{nbsp}}December 1944.{{sfn|NHHC}} ''Tucker''{{'}}s loss was a setback to the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]], which was trying to assemble every available ship for the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]].{{sfn|Roscoe|1953|p=165}}\n\nThree days after ''Tucker'' sank, the seagoing tugboat {{USS|Navajo|AT-64|2}} arrived on site with divers, [[marine salvage|salvaging]] her guns, turbines, anchors and chains. During the remainder of the war, the Navy used the wreckage site for diver training; they did not undertake further salvaging. \nSettling in just {{convert|60|ft}} of water, the ship was easily accessible to private salvors, who harvested anything of value, ransacking and further scattering ''Tucker''{{'}}s remains. Sport divers also had a destructive effect on the site, which by 1997 resembled an \"underwater junkyard\".{{sfn|Stone|1997|pp=78\u201379}} Mike Gerken, an underwater photojournalist, dove the ''Tucker'' wreckage site several times; in 2013 he eulogized ''Tucker'' and other sunken ships:\n\n{{quote\n|text=To see a ship with a distinguished record as the ''Tucker'' in such a poor state gave me pause for thought.

She operated with them along the West Coast and in the Hawaiian islands as part of Destroyer Squadron{{nbsp}}3 of the Destroyer Division.\nIn February 1939, she took part in [[Fleet Problem&nbsp;XX]], a naval exercise held in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean and observed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. As tensions with Japan increased, the fleet was ordered to return to Hawaiian waters.{{sfn|NHHC}}\n\nIn June 1940, ''Tucker'' steamed from Hawaii to a location east of [[Wake Island]] for fleet exercises. In ''United States Navy Destroyers of World War II,'' John Reilly, Jr. described the uncommon method used to power the vessel on its return to Hawaii: {{blockquote|... Tucker stretched her fuel supply by rigging Sails. Her homemade [[foresail]] and [[mainsail]] moved Tucker at an estimated 3.4 knots, letting her maintain [[Glossary of nautical terms#steerageway|steerageway]] as she loitered on station several days.{{sfn|Reilly|1983|p=30}}}}\n\n''Tucker'' continued operating between Hawaii and the West Coast into February 1941. She then set course for New Zealand on a goodwill tour, arriving in [[Auckland]] on 17 March. Returning to Pearl Harbor, she took part in routine exercises at sea before returning to her homeport of San Diego on 19{{nbsp}}September. After a short stay, ''Tucker'' steamed to Hawaii in November as part of Task Force{{nbsp}}19, operating again in the Hawaiian Islands. Shortly afterward, she put into Pearl Harbor for an overhaul by a [[destroyer tender]].{{sfn|NHHC}}\n\nWhen the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, ''Tucker'' was one of five destroyers moored at berth X\u20139, East Loch, alongside the destroyer tender {{USS|Whitney|AD-4|2}}.{{sfn|Roscoe|1953|pp=47\u201348}} Even before ''Tucker''{{'}}s [[general quarters]] alarm could be sounded, one of her on-deck sailors began firing a 50-caliber machine gun at the first wave of Japanese aircraft. When the second wave attacked, every ship that could opened fire. ''Tucker''{{'}}s gunners scored hits on at least two aircraft: one crashed in a cane field, another in flames disappeared over a mountaintop. Still undergoing overhaul, much of ''Tucker''\u2019s machinery had been torn down for repairs. Despite the crew's efforts, she was unable to get [[underway]] until that evening.{{sfn|Parkin|1996|p=68}}\n\nAfter her overhaul, ''Tucker'' patrolled off Pearl Harbor and spent several months escorting convoys between Hawaii and the West Coast. With new orders, she steamed to the South Pacific for convoy duty. ''Tucker'' then escorted the [[seaplane tender]] {{USS|Wright|AV-1|2}} to [[Tutuila]], [[American Samoa]], as part of the drive to fortify outposts. She then escorted her charge to [[Suva]], [[British Fiji|Fiji]], and proceeded to [[Noumea]], [[New Caledonia]]. Steaming on for Australia, she arrived at [[Sydney]] on 27{{nbsp}}April. After taking on fuel, she visited [[Melbourne]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] before steaming back to Sydney. ''Tucker'' and  ''Wright'' returned to Suva, arriving on 3{{nbsp}}June 1942. For the remainder of June and into the first week of July, ''Tucker'' operated out of Suva before relieving the cruiser {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}} of convoy escort duties on 10{{nbsp}}July. On{{nbsp}}30 July, the ship arrived at Auckland and the following day started back for Suva.{{sfn|NHHC}}\n\n==Fate==\n[[Image:DD-374 sunk 5Aug1942 EspirituSanto NAN09-10-86.jpg|thumb|alt=Naval ship struck by a mine and sinking|USS ''Tucker'' (D-374) sinking south of Espiritu Santo,  5 August 1942]]\n\nOn 1{{nbsp}}August 1942 ''Tucker'' left Suva, escorting the cargo ship SS ''Nira Luckenbach'' to [[Espiritu Santo]], [[New Hebrides]].{{sfn|NHHC}} On 4{{nbsp}}August ''Tucker'' led the cargo ship into the harbor at Espiritu Santo, as she headed into the western entrance, she struck at least one [[Naval mine|mine]]. The explosion tore her hull nearly in two at the [[Funnel (ship)|No.{{nbsp}}1 stack]], killing all three crew members on watch in the forward [[fire room]]. The rest of the ship's company survived.\n''Nira Luckenbach'' and other vessels rescued sailors from their sinking ship. ''Tucker''{{'}}s [[stern]] sank the following morning; a diving party scuttled and sank her [[bow (ship)|bow]].{{sfn|Roscoe|1953|p=165}} The ship had steamed into the [[Segond Channel]] unaware that the minelayers {{USS|Gamble|DD-123|2}}, {{USS|Breese|DD-122|2}}, and {{USS|Tracy|DD-214|2}} had laid mines at its western entrance. An investigation revealed that ''Tucker's'' captain had not been informed of the minefield.{{sfn|Rohwer|2005|p=184}} She was stricken from the ''[[Naval Vessel Register]]'' on 2{{nbsp}}December 1944.{{sfn|NHHC}} ''Tucker''{{'}}s loss was a setback to the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]], which was trying to assemble every available ship for the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]].{{sfn|Roscoe|1953|p=165}}\n\nThree days after ''Tucker'' sank, the seagoing tugboat {{USS|Navajo|AT-64|2}} arrived on site with divers, [[marine salvage|salvaging]] her guns, turbines, anchors and chains. During the remainder of the war, the Navy used the wreckage site for diver training; they did not undertake further salvaging. \nSettling in just {{convert|60|ft}} of water, the ship was easily accessible to private salvors, who harvested anything of value, ransacking and further scattering ''Tucker''{{'}}s remains. Sport divers also had a destructive effect on the site, which by 1997 resembled an \"underwater junkyard\".{{sfn|Stone|1997|pp=78\u201379}} Mike Gerken, an underwater photojournalist, dove the ''Tucker'' wreckage site several times; in 2013 he eulogized ''Tucker'' and other sunken ships:\n\n{{quote\n|text=To see a ship with a distinguished record as the ''Tucker'' in such a poor state gave me pause for thought.
