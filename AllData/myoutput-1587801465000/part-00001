The kingdom's grip on the region was weak, and by 1370 it was forced to surrender it to [[Harihara I]] of the [[Vijayanagara empire]]. The Vijayanagara monarchs held on to the territory until 1469, when it was appropriated by the [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmani sultans]] of [[Gulbarga]]. After that dynasty crumbled, the area fell into the hands of the [[Adil Shahi]]s of [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]], who established as their auxiliary capital the city known under the Portuguese as [[Velha Goa]] (or Old Goa).<ref name=dobbie>{{cite book|last=Dobbie|first=Aline|title=India: The Elephant's Blessing|year=2006|publisher=Melrose Press|pages=253 pages (see page 220)}}</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nMahadev Temple, Tambdi Surla (12th century).jpg|The [[Mahadev Temple, Tambdi Surla|Mahadev Temple]], attributed to the [[Kadambas of Goa]]; in what is today [[Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park]].\nKadamba.PNG|Gold coins issued by the Kadamba king of Goa, Shivachitta Paramadideva.

They set up a permanent settlement in Velha Goa. This was the beginning of [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colonial rule]] in Goa that would last for four and a half centuries, until its [[Annexation of Goa|annexation in 1961]].

By the mid-18th century, Portuguese Goa had expanded to most of the present-day state limits. Simultaneously the Portuguese lost other possessions in India until their borders stabilised and formed the [[Portuguese India|Estado da \u00cdndia Portuguesa]] or ''State of Portuguese India''.\n\n===Contemporary period===\n{{See also|Annexation of Goa}}\nAfter [[Indian independence movement|India gained independence]] from the British in 1947, India requested that Portuguese territories on the Indian subcontinent be ceded to India.

It lies on the left bank of the Mandovi. The seat of the [[Goa Legislative Assembly]] is in [[Porvorim]], across the Mandovi from Panaji.

Unlike other states, which follow the British Indian model of civil laws framed for individual religions, the Portuguese [[Goa civil code]], a uniform code based on the [[Napoleonic code]], has been retained in Goa.\n\nGoa has a [[unicameral]] [[legislature]], the [[Goa Legislative Assembly]], of 40 members, headed by a speaker. The Chief Minister heads the executive, which is made up from the party or coalition elected with a majority in the legislature. The Governor, the head of the state, is appointed by the President of India.

The coconut tree has been reclassified by the government as a palm (like a grass), enabling farmers and real estate developers to clear land with fewer restrictions.\n\nRice is the main food crop, and pulses (legume), ''Ragi'' (Finger Millet) and other food crops are also grown. Main cash crops are coconut, cashewnut, arecanut, sugarcane and fruits like pineapple, mango and banana.<ref name=\"nic1\" /> Goa's state animal is the [[Gaur]], the state bird is the Ruby Throated Yellow Bulbul, which is a variation of [[Black-crested Bulbul]], and the state tree is the [[Terminalia tomentosa|Matti (Asna)]].\n\nThe important forests products are bamboo canes, [[Maratha]] barks, chillar barks and the [[bhirand]].

Iron, bauxite, manganese, clays, limestone, and silica are mined. The [[Mormugao]] port handled 31.69&nbsp;million tonnes of cargo last year, which was 39% of India's total iron ore exports. [[Sesa Goa]] (now owned by Vedanta Resources) and Dempo are the lead miners. Rampant mining has been depleting the forest cover as well as posing a health hazard to the local population. Corporations are also mining illegally in some areas. During 2015\u201316, the total traffic handled by Mormugao port was recorded to be 20.78&nbsp;million tonnes.\n\nAgriculture, while of shrinking importance to the economy over the past four decades, offers part-time employment to a sizeable portion of the populace. Rice is the main agricultural crop, followed by areca, cashew, and coconut. Fishing employs about 40,000 people, though recent official figures indicate a decline of the importance of this sector and also a fall in catch, due perhaps, to traditional fishing giving way to large-scale mechanised trawling.\n\nMedium scale industries include the manufacturing of pesticides, fertilisers, tyres, tubes, footwear, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, wheat products, steel rolling, fruits and fish canning, cashew nuts, textiles, brewery products.\n\nCurrently, there are 16 planned SEZs in Goa. The Goa government has recently decided to not allow any more [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZs) in Goa after strong opposition to them by political parties and the powerful Goa Catholic Church.<ref name=goasez>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Business/India_Business/Goa_not_to_have_any_more_SEZs_Digamber_Kamat/rssarticleshow/2538932.cms|title=Goa not to have any more SEZs|accessdate=13 November 2007|work=The Times of India|date=13 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011132502/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Business/India_Business/Goa_not_to_have_any_more_SEZs_Digamber_Kamat/rssarticleshow/2538932.cms#|archive-date=11 October 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGoa is also notable for its low priced beer, wine, and spirits prices due to its very low excise duty on alcohol.

The Portuguese set up seminaries for religious education and parish schools for elementary education. Founded circa 1542 by Saint Francis Xavier, [[Saint Paul's College, Goa]] was a Jesuit school in Old Goa, which later became a college. St Paul's was once the main Jesuit institution in the whole of Asia. It housed the first printing press in India and published the first books in 1556.\n\nMedical education began in 1801 with the offering of regular medical courses at the Royal and Military Hospital in the old City of Goa. Built in 1842 as the Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica de (Nova) Goa (Medical-Surgical School of Goa), [[Goa Medical College]] is one of Asia's oldest medical colleges and has one of the oldest medical libraries (since 1845).<ref>{{Cite web|title = MEDICALEDUCATION CELL-GMC- BAMBOLIM GOA.|url = http://www.gmcmec.gov.in/|website = gmcmec.gov.in|accessdate = 1 December 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160109164022/http://gmcmec.gov.in/#|archive-date = 9 January 2016|url-status = live}}</ref> It houses the largest hospital in Goa and continues to provide medical training to this day.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Goa has a [[literacy rate]] of 87%, with 90% of males and 84% of females being literate.<ref name=\"LitRate\">{{cite web |url=http://educationforallinindia.com/page157.html |title=District-specific Literates and Literacy Rates, 2001 |accessdate=18 July 2007 |publisher=Education for all in India |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709081028/http://www.educationforallinindia.com/page157.html# |archive-date=9 July 2007 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Each taluka is made up of villages, each having a school run by the government.

There are also a few schools that subscribe to the all-India [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|ICSE]] syllabus or the [[National Institute of Open Schooling|NIOS]] syllabus. Most students in Goa complete their high school with English as the medium of instruction. Most primary schools, however, use Konkani and Marathi (in private, but government-aided schools). As is the case in most of India, enrolment for vernacular media has seen a fall in numbers in favour of English medium education. Per a report published in ''[[The Times of India]]'', 84% of Goan primary schools run without an administrative head.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Cities/84-Goa-schools-without-heads/articleshow/4363801.cms |title=No Administrative head |accessdate=6 April 2009 |work=The Times of India |first1=Gauree |last1=Malkarnekar |date=6 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902072435/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Cities/84-Goa-schools-without-heads/articleshow/4363801.cms# |archive-date=2 September 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nSome notable schools in Goa include [[Sharada Mandir]] School in [[Miramar, Panaji|Miramar]], [[Loyola High School (Goa)|Loyola High School]] in Margao and [[The King's School, Goa|The King's School]] in [[S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Areal]]. After ten years of schooling, students join a Higher Secondary school, which offers courses in popular streams such as [[Science]], [[Liberal Arts|Arts]], [[Law]] and [[Commerce]]. A student may also opt for a course in vocational studies. Additionally, they may join three-year [[diploma]] courses. Two years of college is followed by a [[professional degree]] programme. [[Goa University]], the sole [[university]] in Goa, is located in [[Taleig\u00e3o]] and most Goan colleges are affiliated to it.\n\nThere are six [[engineering]] colleges in the state.

The Vijayanagara monarchs held on to the territory until 1469, when it was appropriated by the [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmani sultans]] of [[Gulbarga]].

It lies on the left bank of the Mandovi. The seat of the [[Goa Legislative Assembly]] is in [[Porvorim]], across the Mandovi from Panaji. As the state comes under the [[Bombay High Court]], Panaji has a bench in it. Unlike other states, which follow the British Indian model of civil laws framed for individual religions, the Portuguese [[Goa civil code]], a uniform code based on the [[Napoleonic code]], has been retained in Goa.\n\nGoa has a [[unicameral]] [[legislature]], the [[Goa Legislative Assembly]], of 40 members, headed by a speaker. The Chief Minister heads the executive, which is made up from the party or coalition elected with a majority in the legislature. The Governor, the head of the state, is appointed by the President of India. After having stable governance for nearly thirty years up to 1990, Goa is now notorious for its political instability having seen fourteen governments in the span of the fifteen years between 1990 and 2005.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2005/01/31/stories/2005013104051100.htm Odds stacked against Parrikar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313090814/http://www.hindu.com/2005/01/31/stories/2005013104051100.htm# |date=13 March 2007 }}, Anil Sastry, ''[[The Hindu]]'', 31 January 2005, verified 2 April 2005</ref>\n\nIn March 2005, the assembly was dissolved by the Governor and [[President's Rule]] was declared, which suspended the legislature.

The coconut tree has been reclassified by the government as a palm (like a grass), enabling farmers and real estate developers to clear land with fewer restrictions.\n\nRice is the main food crop, and pulses (legume), ''Ragi'' (Finger Millet) and other food crops are also grown. Main cash crops are coconut, cashewnut, arecanut, sugarcane and fruits like pineapple, mango and banana.<ref name=\"nic1\" /> Goa's state animal is the [[Gaur]], the state bird is the Ruby Throated Yellow Bulbul, which is a variation of [[Black-crested Bulbul]], and the state tree is the [[Terminalia tomentosa|Matti (Asna)]].\n\nThe important forests products are bamboo canes, [[Maratha]] barks, chillar barks and the [[bhirand]]. Coconut trees are ubiquitous and are present in almost all areas of Goa barring the elevated regions. A large number of [[deciduous]] trees, such as teak, Sal tree, cashew and mango trees are present. Fruits include jackfruit, mango, pineapple and \"black-berry\" (\"podkoam\" in Konkani language). Goa's forests are rich with medicinal plants.\n\n[[File:Goa Fields.JPG|thumb|left|[[Paddy field|Rice paddies]] are common in rural Goa.]]\nFoxes, wild boar and migratory birds are found in the jungles of Goa. The avifauna (bird species) includes kingfisher, ''myna'' and parrot. Numerous types of fish are also caught off the coast of Goa and in its rivers. Crab, lobster, shrimp, jellyfish, oysters and catfish are the basis of the marine fishery. Goa also has a high snake population. Goa has many famous \"National Parks\", including the renowned [[Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary]] on the island of [[Chor\u00e3o (Island)|Chor\u00e3o]]. Other wildlife sanctuaries include the [[Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Molem Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Madei Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary]], and [[Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary]].\n\nGoa has more than 33% of its geographic area under government forests (1224.38&nbsp;km\u00b2) of which about 62% has been brought under Protected Areas (PA) of Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Park.

Iron, bauxite, manganese, clays, limestone, and silica are mined. The [[Mormugao]] port handled 31.69&nbsp;million tonnes of cargo last year, which was 39% of India's total iron ore exports. [[Sesa Goa]] (now owned by Vedanta Resources) and Dempo are the lead miners. Rampant mining has been depleting the forest cover as well as posing a health hazard to the local population. Corporations are also mining illegally in some areas. During 2015\u201316, the total traffic handled by Mormugao port was recorded to be 20.78&nbsp;million tonnes.\n\nAgriculture, while of shrinking importance to the economy over the past four decades, offers part-time employment to a sizeable portion of the populace. Rice is the main agricultural crop, followed by areca, cashew, and coconut. Fishing employs about 40,000 people, though recent official figures indicate a decline of the importance of this sector and also a fall in catch, due perhaps, to traditional fishing giving way to large-scale mechanised trawling.\n\nMedium scale industries include the manufacturing of pesticides, fertilisers, tyres, tubes, footwear, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, wheat products, steel rolling, fruits and fish canning, cashew nuts, textiles, brewery products.\n\nCurrently, there are 16 planned SEZs in Goa. The Goa government has recently decided to not allow any more [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZs) in Goa after strong opposition to them by political parties and the powerful Goa Catholic Church.<ref name=goasez>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Business/India_Business/Goa_not_to_have_any_more_SEZs_Digamber_Kamat/rssarticleshow/2538932.cms|title=Goa not to have any more SEZs|accessdate=13 November 2007|work=The Times of India|date=13 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011132502/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Business/India_Business/Goa_not_to_have_any_more_SEZs_Digamber_Kamat/rssarticleshow/2538932.cms#|archive-date=11 October 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGoa is also notable for its low priced beer, wine, and spirits prices due to its very low excise duty on alcohol. Another main source of cash inflow to the state is remittance, from many of its citizens who work abroad, to their families. It is said to have some of the largest bank savings in the country.\n\nGoa is the second state in India to achieve a 100 percent automatic telephone system with a solid network of telephone exchanges.

Per a report published in ''[[The Times of India]]'', 84% of Goan primary schools run without an administrative head.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Cities/84-Goa-schools-without-heads/articleshow/4363801.cms |title=No Administrative head |accessdate=6 April 2009 |work=The Times of India |first1=Gauree |last1=Malkarnekar |date=6 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902072435/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Cities/84-Goa-schools-without-heads/articleshow/4363801.cms# |archive-date=2 September 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nSome notable schools in Goa include [[Sharada Mandir]] School in [[Miramar, Panaji|Miramar]], [[Loyola High School (Goa)|Loyola High School]] in Margao and [[The King's School, Goa|The King's School]] in [[S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Areal]].

A student may also opt for a course in vocational studies. Additionally, they may join three-year [[diploma]] courses. Two years of college is followed by a [[professional degree]] programme. [[Goa University]], the sole [[university]] in Goa, is located in [[Taleig\u00e3o]] and most Goan colleges are affiliated to it.\n\nThere are six [[engineering]] colleges in the state. [[Goa Engineering College]] and [[National Institute of Technology Goa]] are government funded colleges whereas the private engineering colleges include Don Bosco College of Engineering at Fatorda, Shree Rayeshwar Institute of Engineering and Information Technology at Shiroda, Agnel Institute of Technology and Design (AITD), Assagao, Bardez and [[Padre Conceicao College of Engineering]] at Verna.

NH-66 (ex [[National Highway 17 (India)(old numbering)|NH-17]]) runs along India's west coast and links Goa to [[Mumbai]] in the north and [[Mangalore]] to the south. [[National Highway 4A (India)|NH-4A]] running across the state connects the capital Panaji to [[Belgaum]] in east, linking Goa to cities in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The NH-366 (ex [[National Highway 17A (India)|NH-17A]]) connects NH-66 to [[Mormugao]] Port from Cortalim. The new NH-566 (ex NH-17B) is a four-lane highway connecting Mormugao Port to NH-66 at Verna via [[Dabolim Airport]], primarily built to ease pressure on the NH-366 for traffic to Dabolim Airport and Vasco da Gama. NH-768 (ex NH-4A) links Panaji and Ponda to Belgaum and NH-4. Goa has a total of {{convert|224|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} of national highways, {{Convert|232|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} of state highway and {{convert|815|km|abbr=off}} of district highway. National Highways in Goa are among the narrowest in the country and will remain so for the foreseeable future, as the state government has received an exemption that allows narrow national highways. In Kerala, highways are {{convert|45|m|abbr=off}} wide. In other states National Highways are grade separated highways {{convert|60|m|abbr=off}} wide with a minimum of four lanes, as well as 6 or 8 lane access-controlled expressways.<ref>[http://www.digitalgoa.com/ca_disp.php?id=1428 Goa, Goa Breaking News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304100727/http://www.digitalgoa.com/ca_disp.php?id=1428 |date=4 March 2014 }}.
