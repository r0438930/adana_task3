It is a medical procedure that is used to obtain a view, for example, of the [[vocal folds]] and the [[glottis]]. Laryngoscopy may be performed to facilitate [[tracheal intubation]] during [[general anaesthesia]] or [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] or for [[surgery|surgical]] procedures on the larynx or other parts of the upper [[respiratory tract#Respiratory tree|tracheobronchial tree]].\n\n==Direct laryngoscopy==\n[[File:Larynx (top view).jpg|thumb|Anatomical parts seen during laryngoscopy]]\nDirect laryngoscopy is carried out (usually) with the [[patient]] lying on his or her back; the laryngoscope is inserted into the [[mouth]] on the right side and flipped to the left to trap and move the [[tongue]] out of the line of sight, and, depending on the type of blade used, inserted either anterior or posterior to the [[epiglottis]] and then lifted with an upwards and forward motion (\"away from you and towards the roof \"). This move makes a view of the [[glottis]] possible. \nThis procedure is done in an operation theatre with full preparation for resuscitative measures to deal with respiratory distress.\nThere are at least ten different types of laryngoscope used for this procedure, each of which has a specialized use for the otolaryngologist and medical speech pathologist. This procedure is most often employed by anaesthetists for endotracheal intubation under general anaesthesia, but also in direct diagnostic laryngoscopy with biopsy. It is extremely uncomfortable and is not typically performed on [[conscious]] [[patient]]s, or on patients with an intact [[gag reflex]].\n\n==Indirect laryngoscopy==\nIndirect laryngoscopy is performed whenever the provider visualizes the patient's vocal cords by a means other than obtaining a direct line of sight (e.g. a mirror).  For the purpose of intubation, this is facilitated by fiberoptic bronchoscopes, video laryngoscopes, fiberoptic stylets and mirror or prism optically-enhanced laryngoscopes.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Tracheal intubation}}\n\n[[File:Garcia-Laryngoskop.gif|thumb|The laryngoscopy.

With this in mind, he developed a laryngoscope designed for the sole purpose of tracheal intubation. Similar to Jackson's device, Janeway's instrument incorporated a distal light source. Unique however was the inclusion of [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] within the handle, a central notch in the blade for maintaining the tracheal tube in the midline of the oropharynx during intubation, and a slight curve to the distal tip of the blade to help guide the tube through the glottis. The success of this design led to its subsequent use in other types of surgery. Janeway was thus instrumental in popularizing the widespread use of direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in the practice of anesthesiology.<ref name=Burkle2004/>\n\n==Applications==\n*Helps in intubation during the administration of general anaesthesia or for mechanical ventilation.\n*Detects causes of voice problems, such as breathing voice, hoarse voice, weak voice, or no voice.\n*Detects causes of throat and ear pain.\n*Evaluates difficulty in swallowing : a persistent sensation of lump in the throat, or mucous with blood.\n*Detects strictures or injury to the throat, or obstructive masses in the airway.\n\n==Conventional laryngoscope==\n[[File:Laryngoscopes-Miller blades.JPG|thumb|Laryngoscope handles with an assortment of Miller blades (large adult, small adult, [[pediatrics|pediatric]], [[infant]], and [[neonate]])]]\n[[File:Macintosh Blades.jpg|thumb|'''Laryngoscope''' handle with an assortment of [[Robert Reynolds Macintosh|Macintosh]] blades (large adult, small adult, [[pediatrics|pediatric]], [[infant]], and [[neonate]])]]\nThe vast majority of tracheal intubations involve the use of a [[viewing instrument]] of one type or another.

These include a number of indirect [[Optical fiber|fiberoptic]] viewing laryngoscopes such as the [[fiberscope|flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope]]. The flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope or [[rhinoscope]] can be used for office-based diagnostics or for tracheal intubation. The patient can remain conscious during the procedure, so that the [[vocal folds]] can be observed during [[phonation]]. [[Surgical instrument]]s passed through the scope can be used for performing procedures such as biopsies of suspicious masses. These instruments have become indispensable within the [[otolaryngology]], [[pulmonology]] and [[anesthesia]] communities.\n\nOther available fiberoptic devices include the Bullard scope,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gorback MS |title=Management of the challenging airway with the Bullard laryngoscope |journal=Journal of Clinical Anesthesia |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=473\u20137 |year=1991 |pmid=1760171\n|doi=10.1016/0952-8180(91)90096-6}}</ref> UpsherScope,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pearce AC, Shaw S, Macklin S |title=Evaluation of the Upsherscope.

The frequent failure of direct laryngoscopy to provide an adequate view for tracheal intubation led to the development of alternative devices such as the lighted stylet, and a number of indirect [[Optical fiber|fiberoptic]] viewing laryngoscopes, such as the [[fiberscope]], Bullard scope, Upsher scope, and the WuScope. Though these devices can be effective alternatives to direct laryngoscopy, they each have certain limitations, and none of them is effective under all circumstances. One important limitation commonly associated with these devices is fogging of the [[Lens (optics)|lens]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Foley LJ, Ochroch EA |title=Bridges to establish an emergency airway and alternate intubating techniques |journal=Crit Care Clin |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=429\u201344, vi |date=July 2000 |pmid=10941582 |doi=10.1016/S0749-0704(05)70121-4}}</ref> In an attempt to address some of these limitations, Dr. Jon Berall, a [[New York City]] [[Internal medicine|internist]] and [[emergency medicine]] [[physician]], designed the camera screen straight video laryngoscope in 1998. The first true video laryngoscope Glidescope was produced in 1999 and a production version with 60 degree angle, an onboard heater, and a custom screen was first sold in dec 2000. The true video laryngoscope has a camera on the blade with no intervening fiberoptic components. The concept is important because it is simpler to produce and handle the resultant images from CMOS cameras. The integrated camera leads to a series of low cost variants that are not possible with the hybrid Fiberoptic units.\n\n===GlideScope===\n[[File:Glidescope 02.JPG|thumb|[[Anesthesiologist]] using GlideScope video laryngoscope to [[Tracheal intubation|intubate]] the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] of a patient with challenging [[airway]] [[Human anatomy|anatomy]]]]\nIn 2001, the GlideScope (designed by vascular and [[General surgery|general surgeon]] John Allen Pacey) became the first commercially available video laryngoscope. It incorporates a [[Image resolution|high resolution]] digital camera, connected by a video cable to a high resolution [[TFT LCD|LCD monitor]]. It can be used for tracheal intubation to provide controlled [[mechanical ventilation]], as well as for removal of foreign bodies from the airway. GlideScope owes its superior results to a combination of five key factors:\n#The steep 60-degree angulation of its blade improves the view of the glottis by reducing the requirement for anterior displacement of the tongue.\n#The CMOS APS digital camera is located at the point of angulation of the blade (rather than at the tip). This placement allows the operator to more effectively view the field in front of the camera.\n#The video camera is recessed for protection from blood and secretions which might otherwise obstruct the view.\n#The video camera has a relatively wide viewing angle of 50 degrees.\n#The heated lens innovation helps to prevent fogging of the lens, which might otherwise obscure the view.\n\nTracheal intubation with the GlideScope can be facilitated by the use of the Verathon Stylet, a rigid stylet that is curved to follow the 60\u00b0 angulation of the blade.<ref name=Agro2003/> To achieve a 99% successful rate of intubation with the GlideScope requires the operator to acquire a new skill set with this stylet.\n\nIn a 2003 study, the authors noted that the GlideScope provided adequate vision of the glottis (Cormack and Lehane grade I-II) <ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cormack RS, Lehane J |title=Difficult tracheal intubation in obstetrics |journal=Anaesthesia |volume=39 |issue=11 |pages=1105\u201311 |date=November 1984 |pmid=6507827 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.1984.tb08932.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|author=Ernst Zadrobilek\n|title=The Cormack-Lehane classification: twenty-fifth anniversary of the first published description\n|journal=Internet Journal of Airway Management\n|volume=5\n|date=28 October 2009\n|url=http://www.ijam.at/volume05/historicalnote02/default.htm\n|accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> even when the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes could not be optimally aligned due to the presence of a [[cervical collar]].

The Cobalt series of GlideScope then introduced a single-use variant that encompasses weights from 1000&nbsp;grams to morbid obesity and is successful in many airway syndromes as well. The GlideScope Ranger is a variant designed for use in pre-hospital airway management including air, land, and sea applications. This device weighs 1.5 pounds, and is waterproof as well as airworthy to 20,000 feet altitude. The GlideScope Cobalt is a variant that has a reusable video camera with light-emitting core which has a disposable or single use external shell for prevention of cross infection.\n\nIn August 2009, the team at Verathon collaborated with Professor John Sakles from the University of Arizona Emergency Department in achieving the world's first tracheal intubation conducted with the assistance of [[telemedicine]] technology.

It is a medical procedure that is used to obtain a view, for example, of the [[vocal folds]] and the [[glottis]]. Laryngoscopy may be performed to facilitate [[tracheal intubation]] during [[general anaesthesia]] or [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] or for [[surgery|surgical]] procedures on the larynx or other parts of the upper [[respiratory tract#Respiratory tree|tracheobronchial tree]].\n\n==Direct laryngoscopy==\n[[File:Larynx (top view).jpg|thumb|Anatomical parts seen during laryngoscopy]]\nDirect laryngoscopy is carried out (usually) with the [[patient]] lying on his or her back; the laryngoscope is inserted into the [[mouth]] on the right side and flipped to the left to trap and move the [[tongue]] out of the line of sight, and, depending on the type of blade used, inserted either anterior or posterior to the [[epiglottis]] and then lifted with an upwards and forward motion (\"away from you and towards the roof \"). This move makes a view of the [[glottis]] possible. \nThis procedure is done in an operation theatre with full preparation for resuscitative measures to deal with respiratory distress.\nThere are at least ten different types of laryngoscope used for this procedure, each of which has a specialized use for the otolaryngologist and medical speech pathologist. This procedure is most often employed by anaesthetists for endotracheal intubation under general anaesthesia, but also in direct diagnostic laryngoscopy with biopsy. It is extremely uncomfortable and is not typically performed on [[conscious]] [[patient]]s, or on patients with an intact [[gag reflex]].\n\n==Indirect laryngoscopy==\nIndirect laryngoscopy is performed whenever the provider visualizes the patient's vocal cords by a means other than obtaining a direct line of sight (e.g. a mirror).  For the purpose of intubation, this is facilitated by fiberoptic bronchoscopes, video laryngoscopes, fiberoptic stylets and mirror or prism optically-enhanced laryngoscopes.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Tracheal intubation}}\n\n[[File:Garcia-Laryngoskop.gif|thumb|The laryngoscopy.

With this in mind, he developed a laryngoscope designed for the sole purpose of tracheal intubation. Similar to Jackson's device, Janeway's instrument incorporated a distal light source. Unique however was the inclusion of [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] within the handle, a central notch in the blade for maintaining the tracheal tube in the midline of the oropharynx during intubation, and a slight curve to the distal tip of the blade to help guide the tube through the glottis. The success of this design led to its subsequent use in other types of surgery. Janeway was thus instrumental in popularizing the widespread use of direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in the practice of anesthesiology.<ref name=Burkle2004/>\n\n==Applications==\n*Helps in intubation during the administration of general anaesthesia or for mechanical ventilation.\n*Detects causes of voice problems, such as breathing voice, hoarse voice, weak voice, or no voice.\n*Detects causes of throat and ear pain.\n*Evaluates difficulty in swallowing : a persistent sensation of lump in the throat, or mucous with blood.\n*Detects strictures or injury to the throat, or obstructive masses in the airway.\n\n==Conventional laryngoscope==\n[[File:Laryngoscopes-Miller blades.JPG|thumb|Laryngoscope handles with an assortment of Miller blades (large adult, small adult, [[pediatrics|pediatric]], [[infant]], and [[neonate]])]]\n[[File:Macintosh Blades.jpg|thumb|'''Laryngoscope''' handle with an assortment of [[Robert Reynolds Macintosh|Macintosh]] blades (large adult, small adult, [[pediatrics|pediatric]], [[infant]], and [[neonate]])]]\nThe vast majority of tracheal intubations involve the use of a [[viewing instrument]] of one type or another.

These include a number of indirect [[Optical fiber|fiberoptic]] viewing laryngoscopes such as the [[fiberscope|flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope]]. The flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope or [[rhinoscope]] can be used for office-based diagnostics or for tracheal intubation. The patient can remain conscious during the procedure, so that the [[vocal folds]] can be observed during [[phonation]]. [[Surgical instrument]]s passed through the scope can be used for performing procedures such as biopsies of suspicious masses. These instruments have become indispensable within the [[otolaryngology]], [[pulmonology]] and [[anesthesia]] communities.\n\nOther available fiberoptic devices include the Bullard scope,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gorback MS |title=Management of the challenging airway with the Bullard laryngoscope |journal=Journal of Clinical Anesthesia |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=473\u20137 |year=1991 |pmid=1760171\n|doi=10.1016/0952-8180(91)90096-6}}</ref> UpsherScope,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pearce AC, Shaw S, Macklin S |title=Evaluation of the Upsherscope.

An [[Anaesthetic machine|anesthesia machine]] is visible on the [[Image resolution|high resolution]] [[TFT LCD|LCD monitor]].]]\n\nThe conventional direct laryngoscope uses a line of sight provided by a rigid [[viewing instrument]] with a light on the blade or intra-oral portion which requires a direct view of the target larynx; this view is clearly seen in 80-90% of attempts. The frequent failure of direct laryngoscopy to provide an adequate view for tracheal intubation led to the development of alternative devices such as the lighted stylet, and a number of indirect [[Optical fiber|fiberoptic]] viewing laryngoscopes, such as the [[fiberscope]], Bullard scope, Upsher scope, and the WuScope. Though these devices can be effective alternatives to direct laryngoscopy, they each have certain limitations, and none of them is effective under all circumstances. One important limitation commonly associated with these devices is fogging of the [[Lens (optics)|lens]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Foley LJ, Ochroch EA |title=Bridges to establish an emergency airway and alternate intubating techniques |journal=Crit Care Clin |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=429\u201344, vi |date=July 2000 |pmid=10941582 |doi=10.1016/S0749-0704(05)70121-4}}</ref> In an attempt to address some of these limitations, Dr. Jon Berall, a [[New York City]] [[Internal medicine|internist]] and [[emergency medicine]] [[physician]], designed the camera screen straight video laryngoscope in 1998. The first true video laryngoscope Glidescope was produced in 1999 and a production version with 60 degree angle, an onboard heater, and a custom screen was first sold in dec 2000. The true video laryngoscope has a camera on the blade with no intervening fiberoptic components. The concept is important because it is simpler to produce and handle the resultant images from CMOS cameras. The integrated camera leads to a series of low cost variants that are not possible with the hybrid Fiberoptic units.\n\n===GlideScope===\n[[File:Glidescope 02.JPG|thumb|[[Anesthesiologist]] using GlideScope video laryngoscope to [[Tracheal intubation|intubate]] the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] of a patient with challenging [[airway]] [[Human anatomy|anatomy]]]]\nIn 2001, the GlideScope (designed by vascular and [[General surgery|general surgeon]] John Allen Pacey) became the first commercially available video laryngoscope. It incorporates a [[Image resolution|high resolution]] digital camera, connected by a video cable to a high resolution [[TFT LCD|LCD monitor]]. It can be used for tracheal intubation to provide controlled [[mechanical ventilation]], as well as for removal of foreign bodies from the airway. GlideScope owes its superior results to a combination of five key factors:\n#The steep 60-degree angulation of its blade improves the view of the glottis by reducing the requirement for anterior displacement of the tongue.\n#The CMOS APS digital camera is located at the point of angulation of the blade (rather than at the tip). This placement allows the operator to more effectively view the field in front of the camera.\n#The video camera is recessed for protection from blood and secretions which might otherwise obstruct the view.\n#The video camera has a relatively wide viewing angle of 50 degrees.\n#The heated lens innovation helps to prevent fogging of the lens, which might otherwise obscure the view.\n\nTracheal intubation with the GlideScope can be facilitated by the use of the Verathon Stylet, a rigid stylet that is curved to follow the 60\u00b0 angulation of the blade.<ref name=Agro2003/> To achieve a 99% successful rate of intubation with the GlideScope requires the operator to acquire a new skill set with this stylet.\n\nIn a 2003 study, the authors noted that the GlideScope provided adequate vision of the glottis (Cormack and Lehane grade I-II) <ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cormack RS, Lehane J |title=Difficult tracheal intubation in obstetrics |journal=Anaesthesia |volume=39 |issue=11 |pages=1105\u201311 |date=November 1984 |pmid=6507827 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.1984.tb08932.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|author=Ernst Zadrobilek\n|title=The Cormack-Lehane classification: twenty-fifth anniversary of the first published description\n|journal=Internet Journal of Airway Management\n|volume=5\n|date=28 October 2009\n|url=http://www.ijam.at/volume05/historicalnote02/default.htm\n|accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> even when the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes could not be optimally aligned due to the presence of a [[cervical collar]]. Despite this significant limitation, the average time to intubate the trachea with the GlideScope was only 38 seconds.<ref name=Agro2003/> In 2005, the first major clinical study comparing the Glidescope to the conventional laryngoscope was published. In 133 patients in whom both Glidescope and conventional laryngoscopy were performed, excellent or good laryngeal exposure was obtained in 124/133 (93%) of Glidescope laryngoscopy patients, compared with only 98/133 (74%) of patients in whom conventional laryngoscopy was used.

The Cobalt series of GlideScope then introduced a single-use variant that encompasses weights from 1000&nbsp;grams to morbid obesity and is successful in many airway syndromes as well. The GlideScope Ranger is a variant designed for use in pre-hospital airway management including air, land, and sea applications. This device weighs 1.5 pounds, and is waterproof as well as airworthy to 20,000 feet altitude. The GlideScope Cobalt is a variant that has a reusable video camera with light-emitting core which has a disposable or single use external shell for prevention of cross infection.\n\nIn August 2009, the team at Verathon collaborated with Professor John Sakles from the University of Arizona Emergency Department in achieving the world's first tracheal intubation conducted with the assistance of [[telemedicine]] technology. During this demonstration, Dr. Sakles and the University of Arizona Telemedicine service guided physicians in a [[rural]] [[hospital]] as they performed a tracheal intubation using the GlideScope.\n\n===Other video laryngoscopes===\nSeveral types of [[Laryngoscope#Video laryngoscope|video laryngoscopes]] are also currently available, such as the Truview PCD-R Manufactured by Truphatek Israel, Glidescope,<ref name=Agro2003/><ref name=Cooper2005/> McGrath laryngoscope,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shippey B, Ray D, McKeown D |title=Use of the McGrath videolaryngoscope in the management of difficult and failed tracheal intubation |journal=[[British Journal of Anaesthesia]] |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=116\u20139 |year=2008 |pmid=17959584\n|doi=10.1093/bja/aem303|doi-access=free }}</ref> Daiken Medical Coopdech C-scope VLP-100,<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Daiken Medical Co., Ltd.\n|year=2007\n|url=http://www.baobabmedical.com.au/Pdfs/portablecolourvideo.pdf\n|title=Coopdech video laryngoscope portable VLP-100\n|publisher=Daiken Medical Co., Ltd.\n|location=Osaka, Japan\n|accessdate=27 August 2010\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216044108/http://baobabmedical.com.au/Pdfs/portablecolourvideo.pdf\n|archive-date=16 February 2011\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref> the [[Karl Storz GmbH|Storz]] C-Mac,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Boedeker BH, Berg BW, Bernhagen MA, Murray WB |title=Endotracheal intubation comparing a prototype Storz CMAC and a glidescope videolaryngoscope in a medical transport helicopter - a pilot study |journal=Studies in Health Technology and Informatics |volume=142 |pages=37\u20139 |year=2009 |pmid=19377109 |url=http://booksonline.iospress.nl/Extern/EnterMedLine.aspx?ISSN=0926-9630&Volume=142&SPage=37|accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref> Pentax-AWS(or Airway Scope),<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Pentax Medical Company\n|date=6 July 2006\n|url=http://www.pentax.co.jp/english/news/2006/200633.html\n|title=Airway Scope AWS-S100, Rigid Video Laryngoscope for Intubation\n|publisher=[http://www.pentaxmedical.com/ Pentax Medical Company]\n|location=Montvale, New Jersey\n|accessdate=27 August 2010\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728075509/http://www.pentax.co.jp/english/news/2006/200633.html\n|archive-date=28 July 2010\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|author=Pentax Medical Company\n|url=http://www.pentaxmedical.com/brochures/PentaxAWS.pdf\n|title=Pentax AWS\n|publisher=Pentax Medical Company\n|location=Montvale, New Jersey\n|accessdate=27 August 2010\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715063400/http://www.pentaxmedical.com/brochures/PentaxAWS.pdf\n|archive-date=15 July 2011\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Suzuki A, Toyama Y, Katsumi N, Kunisawa T, Sasaki R, Hirota K, Henderson JJ, Iwasaki H |title=The Pentax-AWS((R)) rigid indirect video laryngoscope: clinical assessment of performance in 320 cases |journal=[[Anaesthesia (journal)|Anaesthesia]] |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=641\u20137|year=2008 |pmid=18477277 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.2008.05452.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Malik MA, O'Donoghue C, Carney J, Maharaj CH, Harte BH, Laffey JG |title=Comparison of the Glidescope, the Pentax AWS, and the Truview EVO2 with the Macintosh laryngoscope in experienced anaesthetists: a manikin study |journal=[[British Journal of Anaesthesia]] |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=128\u201334 |year=2009 |pmid=19059923\n|doi=10.1093/bja/aen342|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Asai T, Enomoto Y, Shimizu K, Shingu K, Okuda Y |title=The Pentax-AWS video-laryngoscope: the first experience in one hundred patients |journal=[[Anesthesia & Analgesia]] |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=257\u20139, table of contents |year=2008 |pmid=18165587\n|doi=10.1213/01.ane.0000287647.46165.bc}}</ref> Video Macintosh Intubating Laryngoscope System (VMS),<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaplan MB, Ward DS, Berci G |title=A new video laryngoscope-an aid to intubation and teaching |journal=Journal of Clinical Anesthesia |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=620\u20136 |year=2002 |pmid=12565125\n|pmc=4803417 |doi=10.1016/S0952-8180(02)00457-9}}</ref> the Berci DCI,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Low D, Healy D, Rasburn N |title=The use of the BERCI DCI Video Laryngoscope for teaching novices direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation |journal=[[Anaesthesia (journal)|Anaesthesia]] |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=195\u2013201 |year=2008 |pmid=18211452\n|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.2007.05323.x}}</ref> and the Copilot VL.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tydlaska|first=Jay|title=Introducing the CoPilotVL|url=http://copilotvl.com|publisher=Magaw LLC|accessdate=5 August 2011}}</ref>   These laryngoscopes employ a variety of features such as a [[Video monitor|monitor]] on the handle and or channels to assist in guiding the endotracheal tube into the trachea.
