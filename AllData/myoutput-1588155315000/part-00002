Despite losing the first match to Queensland the tour was a great success, the Lions winning the Test series against the [[All Blacks]]. They are still the only Lions side to have won a Test series in New Zealand. The side was captained by [[John Dawes]], coached by [[Carwyn James]] and managed by [[Doug Smith (rugby union)|Doug Smith]].\n\nAlthough the Lions had done poorly when touring New Zealand in 1966 (they lost all four Tests to the All Blacks), the seeds had been sown for the successful series of 1971. Wales had won the [[Grand Slam (Rugby Union)#Six Nations Championship|Grand Slam]] in the [[Six Nations Championship|Five Nations Championship]] in 1971, and appropriately supplied more players than any other home nation to the touring squad. Both the coach and captain were also Welsh. This was the only tour to result in a Lions victory over the All Blacks. A major factor in their victory was self belief. [[Gerald Davies]] explained, \"...somewhere along the line it becomes a mental thing...We grew in confidence; we came to believe it was possible to beat the All Blacks.\"<ref>Palenski, R: ''Century in Black, 100 Years of All Black Test Rugby'', page 122. Hodder Moa Beckett Publishers Ltd, 2003</ref>\n\nThe Lions won the [[#First Test|first Test]] in Dunedin 9\u20133, with a penalty goal to the All Blacks, and two penalties and a try, (scored by [[Ian McLauchlan]]) to the Lions. Several Lions players later admitted they were overconfident following their initial Test victory. The Lions were thus convincingly beaten 22\u201312 in the [[#Second Test|second Test]] in Christchurch, with the All Blacks outscoring them five tries (Bob Burgess (2), [[Sid Going]], [[Ian Kirkpatrick]], pen try) to two (Davies (2)). The [[#Third Test|third Test]] was played at [[Athletic Park (Wellington)|Athletic Park]], Wellington. The Lions did not make the same mistake they had in Christchurch, resulting in a 13\u20133 win, the Lions scored two converted tries and a drop goal. The All Blacks managed only a try.\n\nFollowing the third Test the Lions led the series 2\u20131. The final game played in [[Auckland]] would require an All Black victory for New Zealand to draw the series. A draw or Lions victory would give the Lions a series win. Scores were level 8\u20138 at half time with a try, conversion and penalty each. The first 15 minutes of the second half saw the Lions land a penalty goal and the All Blacks score a try. With the scores tied 11\u201311, Lions [[Fullback (rugby union)|fullback]] [[JPR Williams]] received the ball 45 metres out and attempted a drop goal, it was successful and put the Lions ahead 14\u201311. Williams's drop goal was the only one he landed in his Test career. The All Blacks could only manage three further points from a penalty to draw the game 14-14, which gave the Lions the series.\n\n==Squad==\n\n===Backs===\n* [[John Dawes]] ([[London Welsh R.F.C.|London Welsh]] and Wales) (captain)\n* [[J.P.R.
