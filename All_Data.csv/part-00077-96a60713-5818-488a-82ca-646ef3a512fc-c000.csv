'''Máximo Jerez Tellería''' (8 June 1818 in [[León, Nicaragua]] &ndash; 12 August 1881 in [[Washington, D.C.]], USA) was a 19th-century [[Nicaragua]]n [[politician]], [[lawyer]] and [[military leader]].

He is considered to be one of the greatest [[Liberalism|Liberal]] political thinkers in Nicaraguan history. He was a leader of the movement towards Central American unity.<ref>Gamez, Jose D., ''El León del Istmo Apuntamientos para la Biografía de Máximo Jerez'', Guadalupe LTDA, 1989, Colombia.</ref><ref>

Together with [[Francisco Castellón Sanabria]], he participated in bringing to Nicaragua the [[Filibuster (military)|filibuster]] of [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] and on 31 October 1855 was designated Minister of Foreign Relations in Walker's provisional government, led officially by [[Patricio Rivas]]. He ran for the presidency in 1856, but no candidate obtained an absolute majority. By Walker's decision, provisional President Rivas summoned new elections on 10 March 1856, but countermanded the decree on 14 March, and broke relations with Walker.

'''Karl Max Schneider''' (13 March 1887 - 26 October 1955) was an East German zoologist who served as director for the [[Leipzig Zoological Garden|Leipzig Zoo]] from 1934 till his death. He was an expert on lions and their biology and was responsible for coining the behavioural term \"[[flehmen]]\".

==Biography==
Schneider was born in [[Callenberg]], [[Lichtenstein, Saxony|Lichtenstein]], one of six siblings in a merchant family. He studied in his hometown and then at [[Waldenburg, Baden-Württemberg|Waldenberg]] where he became a teacher from 1908 working in Meerane. In 1912 he received an [[Abitur]] from the Realgymnasium Freiberg and a degree in science in 1910 from the University of Leipzig. In 1913 he wrote a thesis on the philosophy of [[Heinrich Rickert]]'s [[transcendentalism]], but due to the onset of World War I he received a doctorate only in 1918. During the war he was drafted into the front line and was injured in the lower left leg, leading to its amputation. After the war he became an assistant in zoology at Frankfurt University. In 1919 he moved to Leipzig and worked at the university and as an assistant in the Leipzig Zoo from 1920. In 1934 he became director of the Leipzig Zoo where he took a special interest in the breeding behaviour of big cats, particularly lions. He coined the word flehmen in 1930<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schneider, K.M.|year=1930| title= Das Flehmen, Part 1 |journal= Zool.

He made it to a friend's house and died. His last words were, \"Keep my boys together.\" At the middle of the book, he is removed from his baseball team due to the fact that he has no birth certificate of file.

He is sitting on the sidelines on a game when Ellie and her father show up with his birth certificate and he is allowed to finish the game.

[[Image:Bordeaux sainte catherine.jpg|thumb|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]

The '''rue Sainte-Catherine''', a 1.2 km long pedestrian street, is the main shopping street in [[Bordeaux]], [[France]].

Located on the former roman [[cardo]], this street is one of two main lines running through the historic part of the city. It cuts the center following a North-South axis linking the place de la Comédie where the [[Grand Théâtre (Bordeaux)|Grand Theatre]] stands to the Place de la Victoire. The rue Sainte-Catherine and neighborhoods located to the West are very commercial areas. It became a pedestrian street for most of its length between 1976 and 1977 and then in full in 1984. It is often billed as the longest pedestrian street in Europe.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} It was completely refurbished between 2000 and 2003 in a project by [[Jean-Michel Wilmotte]].

At the center of the rue Sainte-Catherine you find place Saint-Project ([[Auvergnat (dialect)|Auvergnat]] bishop died in 674). The cross intersection was restored in 1977, it was at the centre of a cemetery since 1392. The church was located to the south and its bell tower still remains. The fountain was made around 1715.

At the top of the street is one of the entrances to the Galerie Bordelaise, a shopping mall which opened in 1834.

At the junction of the street and the cours Alsace-Lorraine, a [[bas-relief]] indicates the presence of two underground rivers that are flowing into the [[Garonne]]: the [[Peugue]] and [[Devèze River|Devèze]].

== Transport ==
The rue Sainte-Catherine is served by [[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|Line A]] of the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]], [[Station Sainte-Catherine (Tram de Bordeaux)|station Sainte-Catherine]], and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|Line B]], stations [[Station Grand Théâtre (Tram de Bordeaux)|Grand Théâtre]] and  [[Station Victoire (Tram de Bordeaux)|Victoire]].

The '''gallbladder flush''' or '''liver cleanse''' is an [[alternative medicine]] practice involving fasting, followed by the ingestion of some combination of [[magnesium sulfate|Epsom salt]], [[olive oil]], and [[grapefruit]] juice, in some cases substituted by other, similar ingredients.<ref name=AMR/> Those who advocate it claim that it is possible to remove not only the well-known [[gallstone]]s from the [[gallbladder]], but also the so-called intra-hepatic stones from the [[bile duct]]s of the [[liver]] by this procedure.

[[File:Umananda Island, Guwahati (4).jpg|thumb|As seen from Umananda Ghat, near Guwahati Highcourt (August 2018)]]

'''Umananda Island''' (from [[Assamese language|Assamese]] ''Uma'', another name for the [[Hindu deities|Hindu goddess]] [[Parvati]], the wife of [[Shiva]]; and ''ananda'', \"happiness\") is the smallest river island in the midst of [[Brahmaputra River|river Brahmaputra]] flowing through the city of [[Guwahati]] in [[Assam]], a state in northeast [[India]]. The [[British Raj|British]] named the island ''Peacock Island'' for its structure. The island can be reached via 10 minute ferry, available from Umananda Ghat, located near Guwahati Highcourt.

==Mythology==
According to [[Hindu mythology]], Shiva created the island for his wife Parvati's happiness and pleasure. Shiva is said to have resided here in the form of Bhayananda. According to a myth in [[Kalika Purana]], Shiva burnt [[Kamadeva]] with his [[third eye]] on Umananda when he interrupted Shiva's deep meditation, hence its alternative name ''Bhasmachal'' (Assamese: ''bhasma'', \"ash\"; and ''achal'', \"hill\"; literally, \"hill of ashes\").

==History==
In 1897, [[1897 Assam earthquake|an earthquake]] damaged the temple heavily, but was later repaired by a local merchant. The temple displays mixture of both Hindu [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaivism]]. There are Assamese craftings of [[Ganesha]], Shiva, Parvati, [[Vishnu]], and other Hindu deities. During the repairing work of the temple some new [[Vaishnavi (deity)|Vaishnavi]] scripts were written on the walls. Craftsmen also carved figures out of rock on the island.

==Festivals==
[[Maha Shivaratri]] is widely celebrated in Umananda. Monday is considered to be the holiest day in the temple and the [[new moon]] brings bliss to the pilgrims.

==Biodiversity==
[[File:Umananda Island, Guwahati (56).jpg|thumb|Island is home Golden Langur]]
Umananda Island was the home to the species of the endangered [[Gee's golden langur|golden langur]], introduced to the island in the 1980s, with the last one dying in 2020.<ref>https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/36-years-after-they-were-first-introduced-golden-langurs-disappear-from-umananda-temple/story-eLdI4jh0mSh8BQz8uazPVN.html</ref>

'''Carlo II Malatesta''' ({{Circa|1390}} – 14 November 1438) was an Italian politician and [[condottiero]]. He was lord of [[Pesaro]], [[Gradara]], [[Senigallia]], [[Fossombrone]] and [[Civitanova Marche]]. He was the son of [[Malatesta IV Malatesta]] and [[Elisabetta da Varano]].

==Life==
In 1409 he followed his father to [[Florence]] to fight against the [[King of Naples]]'s army. In 1421 he fought for the [[Papal States]] against [[Perugia]] and for a short time for the Florentines against [[Milan]]. He and his brother [[Galeazzo Malatesta|Galeazzo]] were captured at [[Gradara]] in 1424 after their father's and their cousin Carlo's defeat at [[Zagonara]] by the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]]. Carlo joined the Visconti army and in 1426 fought in [[Romagna]] against the Anti-Visconti League.

In 1427 he was made captain general of the Visconti armies, putting him in command of 1,200 cavalry in the battle against [[Francesco Bussone]]. The Visconti force was defeated at [[Pizzighettone]] and Carlo was captured again until being freed when the two sides made peace. In 1428 Carlo married [[Colonna family|Vittoria Colonna]], [[Pope Martin V]]'s niece, but the couple remained childless. In 1430 he fought against [[Rimini]] but was defeated and fled from [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]]. Shortly afterwards he defended [[Bologna]] against an attack by [[Anton Galeazzo Bentivoglio]].

In 1431 a revolt broke out in [[Pesaro]], forcing Carlo to retreat to [[Fossombrone]] then to Gradara and elsewhere. In 1433 he helped the Montefeltro and the Visconti reconquer their own lands. The resulting treaty brought peace between the Papal States and the two Malatesta brothers, Carlo and Galeazzo. Carlo returned to Pesaro on 24 September and killed all those who had revolted two years earlier.

The '''Wellington West Coast and Taranaki Regiment''' was a Territorial Force unit of the [[New Zealand Army]]. It was originally formed in 1948 by the amalgamation of two separate regiments:
*'''Wellington West Coast Regiment''' (previously the 7th (Wellington West Coast Rifles) Regiment)
*'''Taranaki Regiment'''  (previously the 11th (Taranaki Rifles) Regiment)

The regiment became a TF battalion of the [[Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment]] in 1964 during the reorganisation of the army. This was until the later reorganisation of 1999, which saw the TF battalions split from the RNZIR to become multi-function ''battalion groups''. The Wellington, West Coast and Taranaki Regiment became the 5th Wellington, West Coast and Taranaki Battalion Group, with the following unit types:
*[[Military engineering|Engineers]] – 1 Field Squadron, [[Corps of Royal New Zealand Engineers|RNZE]]
*[[Infantry]]
*[[Battlefield medicine|Medical]]
*[[Logistics]]
*[[Pipe band|Pipes and Drums of the Wellington West Coast and Taranaki Regiment]]

In December 2012 the regiment was amalgamated with the [[Wellington_(City_of_Wellington's_Own)_and_Hawke's_Bay_Regiment|7th Wellington and Hawke's Bay Battalion]] to form the [[5th/7th Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment]] (5/7 RNZIR).

==Battle honours==
*New Zealand
*South Africa
*First World War: Somme 1916–18, Messines 1917, Ypres 1917, Bapaume 1918, Hindenburg Line, Landing at ANZAC, France and Flanders 1916–1918, Sari Bair 1915, Gallipoli 1915, Egypt 1915–1916
*Second World War: Greece 1941, Crete, Sidi Rezegh 1941, Minquar Qaim, El Alamein, North Africa 1940–1943, Cassino I, The Senio, Italy 1943–45, Solomons

The regiment is one of two unique regiments of the Commonwealth, in that it is one of two regiments to have its own country's name as a battle honour. This dates from the service of the Taranaki Volunteer Rifle Corps, from which the Taranaki Regiment is descended, during the [[New Zealand Wars]], specifically in the [[Battle of Waireka]].

The other unit to share this honour is the [[Cape Town Highlanders Regiment]], a reserve mechanised unit of [[South African Army]].

'''Capitol City''' is a [[ghost town]] in [[Hinsdale County, Colorado]], on the [[Alpine Loop National Scenic Back Country Byway]].

Capitol City was founded in 1877, originally named Galena City. At its peak, the city boasted around 800 citizens and its' founders wished it had become the capital of [[Colorado]].

== History ==
As its name hints, Capitol City's founder wished for it to become the capital of Colorado. George Lee started the town in 1877, originally calling the site Galena City. At its peak, however, it only had a population of less than 1,000 people. In order to try and garner interest, he would later change the name to Capitol City as he had also dreamed of becoming the state's governor.

Lee built a beautiful home here with brick hauled from Pueblo at $1 per brick. It reportedly had a generous living room, theater with an orchestral pit and a few guest ballrooms. In addition to his house, he built the Henson Creek smelter and sawmill. The original 200-acre town site had everything needed, including a few hotels, restaurants, bars, a post office, schoolhouse, cabins, a sawmill and mining smelters. The richest year was in 1877, when the town boasted a population of 800. When the cost of silver dropped, so did the residents. Lawsuits and difficult transportation also sped up the town's downfall. <ref name=\":0\" />

== Geography ==
The city is located on Engineer Pass, a part of the Alpine 4×4 Loop. A national scenic byway. The town can be accessed via [[Lake City, Colorado|Lake City]], which is situated 9mi (14.5km) to the East on CO-20.
