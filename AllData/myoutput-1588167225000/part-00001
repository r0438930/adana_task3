In total, hundreds of thousands of texts and text fragments have been excavated, covering a vast textual tradition of mythological narrative, legal texts, scientific works, correspondence, political and military events, and many other examples. \n\nAkkadian (in its Assyrian and Babylonian varieties) was the native language of the Mesopotamian empires ([[Akkadian Empire]], [[Old Assyrian Empire]], [[Babylonia]], [[Middle Assyrian Empire]]) throughout the later Bronze Age, and Akkadian became the [[lingua franca]] of much of the Ancient [[Near East]] by the time of the [[Bronze Age collapse]]. Its decline began in the Iron Age,   during the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], by about the 8th century BC ([[Tiglath-Pileser III]]), \nin favour of [[Old Aramaic language|Old Aramaic]].  By the [[Hellenistic period]], the language was largely confined to scholars and priests working in temples in Assyria and Babylonia.

Akkadian and its successor Aramaic, however, are only ever attested in Mesopotamia and the Near East.\n\nWithin the Near Eastern Semitic languages, Akkadian forms an [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic]] subgroup (with [[Eblaite language|Eblaite]]). This group distinguishes itself from the Northwest and South Semitic languages by its [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] word order, while the other Semitic languages usually have either a [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] or [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] order. This novel word order is due to the influence of the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] substratum, which has an SOV order.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAdditionally Akkadian is the only Semitic language to use the [[preposition and postposition|preposition]]s ''ina'' and ''ana'' ([[locative case]], English ''in''/''on''/''with'', and [[dative case|dative]]-locative case, ''for''/''to'', respectively). Other Semitic languages like [[Arabic]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] have the prepositions ''bi/b\u0259'' and ''li/l\u0259'' (locative and dative, respectively). The origin of the Akkadian spatial prepositions is unknown.\n\nIn contrast to most other Semitic languages, Akkadian has only one non-sibilant [[fricative consonant|fricative]]: '''\u1e2b''' {{IPA|[x]}}. Akkadian lost both the [[glottal consonant|glottal]] and [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] fricatives, which are characteristic of the other Semitic languages. Until the Old Babylonian period, the Akkadian [[sibilant]]s were exclusively [[affricate consonant|affricated]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History and writing==\n\n===Writing===\n{{Main|Akkadian cuneiform}}\n[[Image:AkkadischLand.png|200px|thumb|[[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform writing]] (Neoassyrian script)<br />(1 = Logogram (LG) \"mix\"/syllabogram (SG) ''{{IPA|\u1e2bi}}'',<br />2 = LG \"moat\",<br />3 = SG ''{{IPA|a\u02be}}'',<br />4 = SG ''{{IPA|a\u1e2b}}, {{IPA|e\u1e2b}}, {{IPA|i\u1e2b}}, {{IPA|u\u1e2b}}'',<br />5 = SG ''kam'',<br />6 = SG ''im'',<br />7 = SG ''bir'')]]\nOld Akkadian is preserved on clay tablets dating back to c. 2500 BC. It was written using [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]], a script adopted from the Sumerians using wedge-shaped symbols pressed in wet clay. As employed by Akkadian scribes, the adapted cuneiform script could represent either (a) [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[logogram]]s (''i.e.'', picture-based characters representing entire words), (b) Sumerian syllables, (c) Akkadian syllables, or (d) [[phonetic complement]]s. However, in Akkadian the script practically became a fully fledged [[Syllabary|syllabic script]], and the original [[Logogram|logographic]] nature of cuneiform became secondary, though logograms for frequent words such as 'god' and 'temple' continued to be used. For this reason, the sign ''AN'' can on the one hand be a logogram for the word ''ilum'' ('god') and on the other signify the god [[Anu]] or even the syllable ''-an-''. Additionally, this sign was used as a [[determinative]] for divine names.\n\nAnother peculiarity of Akkadian cuneiform is that many signs do not have a well-defined phonetic value. Certain signs, such as ''{{transl|sem|A\u1e2a}}'', do not distinguish between the different [[vowel]] qualities. Nor is there any coordination in the other direction; the syllable ''{{transl|sem|-\u0161a-}}'', for example, is rendered by the sign ''{{transl|sem|\u0160A}}'', but also by the sign ''{{transl|sem|N\u012a\u011c}}''. Both of these are often used for the same syllable in the same text.\n\nCuneiform was in many ways unsuited to Akkadian: among its flaws was its inability to represent important [[phonemes]] in Semitic, including a [[glottal stop]], [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeals]], and [[emphatic consonant]]s. In addition, cuneiform was a [[syllabary]] writing system\u2014i.e., a consonant plus vowel comprised one writing unit\u2014frequently inappropriate for a Semitic language made up of [[Triliteral|triconsonantal root]]s (i.e., three consonants plus any vowels).\n\n===Development===\nAkkadian is divided into several [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] based on [[geography]] and [[historical period]]:<ref>Caplice, p.5 (1980)</ref>\n*Old Akkadian, 2500\u20131950 BC\n*Old Babylonian and Old Assyrian, 1950\u20131530 BC\n*Middle Babylonian and Middle Assyrian, 1530\u20131000 BC\n*Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian, 1000\u2013600 BC\n*Late Babylonian, 600 BC\u2013100 AD\n[[File:Antiochus cylinder.jpg|thumb|left|Cylinder of Hellenistic king [[Antiochus I]] (r.281\u2013261 BC), as great king of kings of [[Babylon]], restorer of gods [[Esagila|E-sagila]] and [[E-zida]].

During the [[Middle Bronze Age]] (Old Assyrian and Old Babylonian period), the language virtually displaced Sumerian, which is assumed to have been extinct as a living language by the 18th century BC.\n\nOld Akkadian, which was used until the end of the 3rd millennium BC, differed from both Babylonian and Assyrian, and was displaced by these dialects. By the 21st century BC Babylonian and Assyrian, which were to become the primary dialects, were easily distinguishable. Old Babylonian, along with the closely related dialect [[Mari, Syria|Mariotic]], is clearly more innovative than the Old Assyrian dialect and the more distantly related [[Eblaite language]]. For this reason, forms like ''lu-prus'' ('I will decide') were first encountered in Old Babylonian instead of the older ''la-prus''. While generally more archaic, Assyrian developed certain innovations as well, such as the \"Assyrian [[vowel harmony]]\". Eblaite was even more so, retaining a productive [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] and a [[relative pronoun]] declined in case, number and gender. Both of these had already disappeared in Old Akkadian. Over 20,000 cuneiform tablets in Old Akkadian have been recovered from the [[K\u00fcltepe]] site in [[Anatolia]]. Most of the archaeological evidence is typical of Anatolia rather than of Assyria, but the use both of [[cuneiform]] and the dialect is the best indication of Assyrian presence.<ref>K. R. Veenhof, Ankara Kultepe Tabletleri V, Turk Tarih Kurumu, 2010, {{ISBN|978-975-16-2235-8}}</ref>\n\nOld Babylonian was the language of king [[Hammurabi]] and his [[Code of Hammurabi|code]], which is one of the oldest collections of laws in the world. (see [[Code of Ur-Nammu]].) The Middle Babylonian (or Assyrian) period started in the 16th century BC. The division is marked by the [[Kassites|Kassite]] invasion of Babylonia around 1550 BC. The Kassites, who reigned for 300 years, gave up their own language in favor of Akkadian, but they had little influence on the language. At its apogee, Middle Babylonian was the written language of diplomacy of the entire [[Ancient Near East]], including Egypt. During this period, a large number of loan words were included in the language from [[Northwest Semitic languages]] and [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]]; however, the use of these words was confined to the fringes of the Akkadian-speaking territory.\n\nMiddle Assyrian served as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in much of the [[Ancient Near East]] of the [[Late Bronze Age]] ([[Amarna Period]]). During the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], Neo-Assyrian began to turn into a chancellery language, being marginalized by [[Old Aramaic]]. Under the [[Achaemenids]], Aramaic continued to prosper, but Assyrian continued its decline. The language's final demise came about during the [[Hellenistic period]] when it was further marginalized by [[Koine Greek]], even though Neo-Assyrian cuneiform remained in use in literary tradition well into [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] times. The latest known text in cuneiform Babylonian is an astronomical almanac dated to 79/80 AD.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hunger |first1=Hermann |last2=de Jong |first2=Teije |title=Almanac W22340a From Uruk: The Latest Datable Cuneiform Tablet |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Assyriologie und vorderasiatische Arch\u00e4ologie |date=30 January 2014 |volume=104 |issue=2 |doi=10.1515/za-2014-0015}}</ref> However, the latest cuneiform texts are almost entirely written in Sumerian logograms.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walker |first1=C.

From 1500 BC onwards, the language is termed Middle Assyrian.\n\nDuring the first millennium BC, Akkadian progressively lost its status as a ''lingua franca''. In the beginning, from around 1000 BC, Akkadian and [[Aramaic]] were of equal status, as can be seen in the number of copied texts: clay tablets were written in Akkadian, while scribes writing on papyrus and leather used Aramaic. From this period on, one speaks of [[Neo-Babylonian]] and [[Neo-Assyrian]]. Neo-Assyrian received an upswing in popularity in the 10th century BC when the Assyrian kingdom became a major power with the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], but texts written 'exclusively' in Neo-Assyrian disappear within 10 years of [[Nineveh]]'s destruction in 612 BC. The dominance of the Neo-Assyrian Empire under [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] over [[Aram-Damascus]] in the middle of the 8th century led to the establishment of Aramaic as a ''lingua franca''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sejongjul.org/archive/view_article?pid=jul-5-1-1|title=Aramaic as a Lingua Franca During the Persian Empire (538-333 B.C.E.)|last=Bae|first=Chul-hyun|date=2004|website=Journal of Universal Language|doi=10.22425/jul.2004.5.1.1|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref> of the empire, rather than it being eclipsed by Akkadian.\n\nAfter the end of the Mesopotamian kingdoms, which were conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], Akkadian (which existed solely in the form of Late Babylonian) disappeared as a popular language. However, the language was still used in its written form; and even after the Greek invasion under [[Alexander the Great]] in the 4th century BC, Akkadian was still a contender as a written language, but spoken Akkadian was likely extinct by this time, or at least rarely used.

The deciphering of the texts started immediately, and bilinguals, in particular [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]]-Akkadian bilinguals, were of great help. Since the texts contained several royal names, isolated signs could be identified, and were presented in 1802 by [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]]. By this time it was already evident that Akkadian was a Semitic language, and the final breakthrough in deciphering the language came from [[Edward Hincks]], [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] and [[Jules Oppert]] in the middle of the 19th century.

For the sibilants, traditionally /\u0161/ has been held to be postalveolar {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, and /s/, /z/, /{{transl|sem|\u1e63}}/ analyzed as fricatives; but attested [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilations]] in Akkadian suggest otherwise.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Kogan, Leonid (2011). \"Proto-Semitic Phonetics and Phonology\". In Semitic languages: an international handbook, Stefan Weninger, ed. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. p. 68.</ref> For example, when the possessive suffix ''-\u0161u'' is added to the root ''awat'' ('word'), it is written ''awassu'' ('his word') even though ''\u0161\u0161'' would be expected. The most straightforward interpretation of this shift from ''t\u0161'' to ''ss'' is that /s, \u1e63/ form a pair of voiceless alveolar affricates {{IPA|[t\u0361s t\u0361s\u02bc]}}, *\u0161 is a voiceless alveolar fricative {{IPA|[s]}}, and *z is a voiced alveolar affricate or fricative {{IPA|[d\u0361z~z]}}. The assimilation is then [awat+su] > {{IPA|[awatt\u0361su]}}. In this vein, an alternative transcription of *\u0161 is *s\u0320, with the macron below indicating a soft (lenis) articulation in Semitic transcription. Other interpretations are possible, however. {{IPA|[\u0283]}} could have been assimilated to the preceding {{IPA|[t]}}, yielding {{IPA|[ts]}}, which would later have been simplified to {{IPA|[ss]}}.\n\nThe phoneme /r/ has traditionally been interpreted as a trill but its pattern of alternation with /{{transl|ar|DIN|\u1e2b}}/ suggests it was a velar (or uvular) fricative. In the Hellenistic period, Akkadian /r/ was transcribed using the Greek \u03c1, indicating it was pronounced similarly as an [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar trills|alveolar trill]] (though Greeks may also have perceived a [[uvular trill]] as \u03c1).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Descent from Proto-Semitic ===\nSeveral [[Proto-Semitic]] phonemes are lost in Akkadian. The Proto-Semitic glottal stop {{transl|sem|[[Aleph (letter)|*\u02be]], as well as the fricatives [[Ayin|*\u02bf]]}}, {{transl|sem|[[He (letter)|*h]], [[Heth (letter)|*\u1e25]]}} are lost as consonants, either by sound change or orthographically, but they gave rise to the vowel quality ''e'' not exhibited in Proto-Semitic. The [[voiceless lateral fricatives]] ({{transl|sem|[[\u015aawt|*\u015b]], [[\u1e0c\u0101d|*\u1e63\u0301]]}}) merged with the sibilants as in [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]], leaving 19 consonantal phonemes.

(section on vowels and semi-vowels)</ref> There is limited contrast between different u-signs in lexical texts, but this scribal differentiation may reflect the superimposition of the Sumerian phonological system (for which an /o/ phoneme has also been proposed), rather than a separate phoneme in Akkadian.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Akkadian and Eblaite|url = https://www.academia.edu/6933497|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-19|last = Huehnergard & Woods|page = 233}}</ref>\n\nAll consonants and [[vowel]]s appear in long and short forms. Long consonants are represented in writing as double consonants, and long vowels are written with a macron (\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u016b). This distinction is [[phoneme|phonemic]], and is used in the grammar, for example ''iprusu'' ('that he decided') versus ''iprus\u016b'' ('they decided').\n\n===Stress===\nThe [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] patterns of Akkadian are disputed, with some authors claiming that nothing is known of the topic. There are however certain points of reference, such as the rule of vowel syncope, and some forms in the cuneiform that might represent the stressing of certain vowels; however, attempts at identifying a rule for stress have so far been unsuccessful.\n\nHuenergard (2005:3-4) claims that stress in Akkadian is completely predictable. In his syllable typology there are three syllable weights: ''light'' (V, CV); ''heavy'' (CVC, CV\u0304, CV\u0302), and ''superheavy'' (CV\u0302C). If the last syllable is superheavy, it is stressed, otherwise the rightmost heavy non-final syllable is stressed. If a word contains only light syllables, the first syllable is stressed.\n\nA rule of Akkadian phonology is that certain short (and probably unstressed) vowels are dropped. The rule is that the last vowel of a succession of syllables that end in a short vowel is dropped, for example the declinational root of the verbal adjective of a root PRS is ''PaRiS-''. Thus the masculine singular nominative is ''PaRS-um'' (< ''*PaRiS-um'') but the feminine singular nominative is ''PaRiStum'' (< ''*PaRiS-at-um''). Additionally there is a general tendency of syncope of short vowels in the later stages of Akkadian.\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Morphology===\n\n====Consonantal root====\nMost roots of the Akkadian language consist of three consonants (called the radicals), but some roots are composed of four consonants (so-called quadriradicals). The radicals are occasionally represented in transcription in upper-case letters, for example ''PRS'' (to decide). Between and around these radicals various [[infix]]es, [[suffix]]es and [[prefix]]es, having word generating or grammatical functions, are inserted. The resulting consonant-vowel pattern differentiates the original meaning of the root. Also, the middle radical can be geminated, which is represented by a doubled consonant in transcription (and sometimes in the cuneiform writing itself).\n\nThe consonants ''{{IPA|\u0294}}'', ''{{IPA|w}}'', ''{{IPA|j}}'' and ''{{IPA|n}}'' are termed \"weak radicals\" and roots containing these radicals give rise to irregular forms.\n\n==== Case, number and gender ====\nFormally, Akkadian has three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and three cases ([[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]] and [[Genitive case|genitive]]). However, even in the earlier stages of the language, the dual number is vestigial, and its use is largely confined to natural pairs (eyes, ears, etc.), and adjectives are never found in the dual. In the dual and plural, the accusative and genitive are merged into a single [[oblique case]].\n\nAkkadian, unlike [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but like [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], has only \"sound\" plurals formed by means of a plural ending (i.e. no [[broken plurals]] formed by changing the word stem). As in all Semitic languages, some masculine nouns take the prototypically feminine plural ending (''-\u0101t'').\n\nThe nouns ''\u0161arrum'' (king) and ''\u0161arratum'' (queen) and the adjective ''dannum'' (strong) will serve to illustrate the case system of Akkadian.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+ Noun and adjective paradigms\n !\n !

Certain nouns, primarily those referring to geography, can also form a locative ending in ''-um'' in the singular and the resulting forms serve as [[adverbial]]s. These forms are generally not productive, but in the Neo-Babylonian the ''um''-locative replaces several constructions with the preposition ''ina''.\n\nIn the later stages of Akkadian the [[mimation]] (word-final ''-m'') - along with [[nunation]] (dual final \"-n\") - that occurred at the end of most case endings disappeared, except in the locative. Later, the nominative and accusative singular of masculine nouns collapsed to ''-u'' and in Neo-Babylonian most word-final short vowels were dropped. As a result, case differentiation disappeared from all forms except masculine plural nouns. However many texts continued the practice of writing the case endings (although often sporadically and incorrectly). As the most important [[Language contact|contact language]] throughout this period was [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], which itself lacks case distinctions, it is possible that Akkadian's loss of cases was an areal as well as [[Phonology|phonological]] phenomenon.\n\n====Noun states and nominal sentences====\nAs is also the case in other Semitic languages, Akkadian nouns may appear in a variety of \"states\" depending on their grammatical function in a sentence. The basic form of the noun is the ''status rectus'' (the [[governed state]]), which is the form as described above, complete with case endings. In addition to this, Akkadian has the ''status absolutus'' (the [[absolute state]]) and the ''status constructus'' ([[Construct state]]). The latter is found in all other Semitic languages, while the former appears only in Akkadian and some dialects of Aramaic.\n\nThe status absolutus is characterised by the loss of a noun's case ending (e.g. ''aw\u012bl'' < ''aw\u012blum'', ''\u0161ar'' < ''\u0161arrum''). It is relatively uncommon, and is used chiefly to mark the predicate of a nominal sentence, in fixed adverbial expressions, and in expressions relating to measurements of length, weight, and the like.\n\n(1) ''Aw\u012bl-um \u0161\u016b \u0161arr\u0101q''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''Aw\u012bl-um'' || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | ''\u0161\u016b'' || Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161arr\u0101q.''\n|-\n| Man (Masculine, nominative) || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | he <small>(3rd masc. personal pronoun)</small> || Align=\"right\" | thief (status absolutus)\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' This man is a thief\n\n(2) ''\u0161arrum l\u0101 \u0161an\u0101n''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161arr-um'' || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | ''l\u0101'' || Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161an\u0101n.''\n|-\n| King <small>(Status rectus, nominative)</small> || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | not <small>(negative particle)</small> || Align=\"right\" | oppose <small>(verbal infinitive, status absolutus)</small>\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The king who cannot be rivaled\n\nThe status constructus is a great deal more common, and has a much wider range of applications. It is employed when a noun is followed by another noun in the genitive, a pronominal suffix, or a verbal clause in the subjunctive, and typically takes the ''shortest form of the noun which is phonetically possible''. In general, this amounts to the loss of case endings with short vowels, with the exception of the genitive -i in nouns preceding a pronominal suffix, hence:\n\n(3) ''m\u0101ri-\u0161u''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''m\u0101ri-\u0161u''\n|-\n| Son (status constructus) + his <small>(3rd person singular possessive pronoun) </small>\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' His son, its (masculine) son\n\nbut\n\n(4) ''m\u0101r \u0161arr-im''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''m\u0101r'' || Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161arr-im''\n|-\n| Son (Status constructus) || king (genitive singular)\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The king's son\n\nThere are numerous exceptions to this general rule, usually involving potential violations of the language's phonological limitations. Most obviously, Akkadian does not tolerate word final consonant clusters, so nouns like ''kalbum'' (dog) and ''ma\u1e2brum'' (front) would have illegal construct state forms ''*kalb'' and ''*ma\u1e2br'' unless modified. In many of these instances, the first vowel of the word is simply repeated (e.g. ''kalab'', ''ma\u1e2bar''). This rule, however, does not always hold true, especially in nouns where a short vowel has historically been elided (e.g. ''\u0161aknum'' < ''*\u0161akinum'' \"governor\"). In these cases, the lost vowel is restored in the construct state (so ''\u0161aknum'' yields ''\u0161akin'').\n\n(5) ''kalab belim''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''kalab'' || Align=\"center\" | ''bel-im''\n|-\n| dog (Status constructus) || master (genitive singular)\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The master's dog\n\n(6) ''\u0161akin \u0101lim''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161akin'' || Align=\"center\" | ''\u0101l-im''\n|-\n| Governor (Status constructus) || city (genitive singular)\n|}\n\nA genitive relation can also be expressed with the relative preposition ''\u0161a'', and the noun that the genitive phrase depends on appears in status rectus.\n\n(7) sal\u012bm\u0101tum \u0161a aw\u012bl E\u0161nunna\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''sal\u012bm\u0101tum'' || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | ''\u0161a'' || Align=\"center\" | ''aw\u012bl''|| Align=\"center\" | ''E\u0161nunna''\n|-\n| Alliances <small>(Status rectus, nominative)</small> || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | which <small>(relative particle)</small> || Align=\"right\" | man <small>(status constructus)</small> || Align=\"right\" | E\u0161nunna <small>(genitive, unmarked)</small>\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The alliances of the Ruler of E\u0161nunna (literally \"Alliances which man of E\u0161nunna (has)\")\n\nThe same preposition is also used to introduce true relative clauses, in which case the verb is placed in the subjunctive mood.\n\n(7) ''aw\u012bl-um \u0161a m\u0101t-am i-k\u0161ud-\u00d8-u''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''Aw\u012bl-um'' || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | ''\u0161a'' || Align=\"center\" | ''m\u0101t-am'' || Align=\"center\" | ''i-k\u0161ud-\u00d8-u''\n|-\n| Man (Masculine, nominative) || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | that <small>(relative pronoun)</small> || Align=\"center\" | land (singular, accusative) || Align=\"center\" | 3rd person - conquer (preterite) - singular, masculine - subjunctive\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The man who conquered the land\n\n====Verbal morphology====\n\n=====Verb aspects=====\nThe Akkadian verb has six [[Finite verb|finite]] [[Grammatical aspect|verb aspects]] ([[preterite]],  [[Perfective|perfect]], [[present tense|present]], [[imperative (grammar)|imperative]], [[Irrealis mood#Precative|precative]] and [[vetitive]]) and three [[Non-finite verb|infinite]] forms ([[infinitive]], [[participle]] and [[Non-finite verb|verbal adjective]]). The preterite is used for actions that are seen by the speaker as having occurred at a single point in time. The present is primarily imperfective in meaning and is used for concurrent and future actions as well as past actions with a temporal dimension. The final three finite forms are [[Injunctive mood|injunctive]] where the imperative and the precative together form a paradigm for positive commands and wishes, and the vetitive is used for negative wishes. Additionally the [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] [[Imperative mood#Indicative and prohibitive mood|prohibitive]], formed by the present form of the verb and the negative [[adverb]] l\u0101, is used to express negative commands. The infinitive of the Akkadian verb is a [[verbal noun]], and in contrast to some other languages the Akkadian infinitive can be declined in [[grammatical case|case]]. The verbal adjective is an adjectival form and designates the state or the result of the action of the verb, and consequently the exact meaning of the verbal adjective is determined by the [[semantics]] of the verb itself. The participle, which can be active or passive, is another verbal adjective and its meaning is similar to the [[English gerund]].\n\nThe following table shows the conjugation of the [[Derived stem|G-stem]] verbs derived from the root PRS (\"to decide\") in the various verb aspects of Akkadian:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n!\n!

The subjunctive is marked in forms which do not end in a vowel by the suffix -u (compare Arabic and Ugaritic subjunctives), but is otherwise unmarked. In the later stages of most dialects, the subjunctive is indistinct, as short final vowels were mostly lost\n#[[Ventive|Venitive]] or [[allative]]. The venitive is not a mood in the strictest sense, being a development of the 1st person dative pronominal suffix -am/-m/-nim. With verbs of motion, it often indicates motion towards an object or person (e.g. ''illik'', \"he went\" vs. ''illikam'', \"he came\"). However, this pattern is not consistent, even in earlier stages of the language, and its use often appears to serve a stylistic rather than morphological or lexical function.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the verb moods of verbs derived from the root PRS (\"to decide\",\"to separate\"):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! Preterite.<ref group=t4 name=third-pm>Both verbs are for the 3rd person masculine singular.</ref>\n! [[Akkadian language#Stative|Stative]].<ref group=t4 name=third-pm/>\n|-\n!

[[Ventive|Venitive]]\n| ''iprusam'' || ''parsam''\n|}\n\n{{reflist|group=t4}}\n\n=====Verb patterns=====\nAkkadian verbs have thirteen separate [[derived stem]]s formed on each [[Triliteral|root]]. The basic, underived, stem is the G-stem (from the German Grundstamm, meaning \"basic stem\"). [[Causative]] or [[intensive]] forms are formed with the doubled D-stem, and it gets its name from the doubled-middle radical that is characteristic of this form. The doubled middle radical is also characteristic of the present, but the forms of the D-stem use the secondary conjugational affixes, so a D-form will never be identical to a form in a different stem. The \u0160-stem is formed by adding a prefix ''\u0161-'', and these forms are mostly causatives. Finally, the passive forms of the verb are in the N-stem, formed by adding a ''n-'' prefix. However the ''n-'' element is assimilated to a following consonant, so the original /n/ is only visible in a few forms.\n\nFurthermore, [[reflexive verb|reflexive]] and [[iterative]] verbal stems can be derived from each of the basic stems. The reflexive stem is formed with an infix ''-ta'', and the [[derived stems]] are therefore called Gt, Dt, \u0160t and Nt, and the preterite forms of the Xt-stem are identical to the perfects of the X-stem. Iteratives are formed with the infix ''-tan-'', giving the Gtn, Dtn, \u0160tn and Ntn. Because of the [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of ''n'', the /n/ is only seen in the present forms, and the Xtn preterite is identical to the Xt [[Dynamic verb|durative]].\n\nThe final stem is the \u0160D-stem, a form mostly attested only in poetic texts, and whose meaning is usually identical to either the \u0160-stem or the D-stem of the same verb.  It is formed with the \u0160 prefix (like the \u0160-stem) in addition to a doubled-middle radical (like the D-stem).\n\nAn alternative to this naming system is a numerical system. The basic stems are numbered using [[Roman numeral]]s so that G, D, \u0160 and N become I, II, III and IV, respectively, and the [[infix]]es are numbered using [[Arabic numeral]]s; 1 for the forms without an infix, 2 for the Xt, and 3 for the Xtn. The two numbers are separated using a solidus. As an example, the \u0160tn-stem is called III/3. The most important user of this system is the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary.\n\nThere is mandatory congruence between the subject of the sentence and the verb, and this is expressed by [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es. There are two different sets of affixes, a primary set used for the forms of the G and N-stems, and a secondary set for the D and \u0160-stems.\n\nThe stems, their nomenclature and examples of the third-person masculine singular [[Akkadian language#Stative|stative]] of the verb ''par\u0101sum'' (root PRS: 'to decide, distinguish, separate') is shown below:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n! # || Stem || Verb || Description || Correspondence\n|-\n|I.1||G||''PaRiS''||the simple stem, used for [[Transitive verbs|transitive]] and [[intransitive verbs]]|| Arabic stem I (''fa\u2018ala'') and Hebrew pa'al\n|-\n|II.1||D||''PuRRuS''||gemination of the second radical, indicating the intensive|| Arabic stem II (''fa\u2018\u2018ala'') and Hebrew ''pi\u2018el''\n|-\n|III.1||\u0160||''\u0161uPRuS''||\u0161-preformative, indicating the causative|| Arabic stem IV (''\u2019af\u2018ala'') and Hebrew ''hiph\u2018il''\n|-\n|IV.1||N||''naPRuS''||n-preformative, indicating the reflexive/passive|| Arabic stem VII (''infa\u2018ala'') and Hebrew ''niph\u2018al''\n|-\n|I.2||Gt||''PitRuS''||simple stem with t-infix after first radical, indicating reciprocal or reflexive|| Arabic stem VIII (''ifta\u2018ala'') and Aramaic ''\u2019ithpe\u2018al'' (tG)\n|-\n|II.2||Dt||''PutaRRuS''||doubled second radical preceded by infixed t, indicating intensive reflexive|| Arabic stem V (''tafa\u2018\u2018ala'') and Hebrew ''hithpa\u2018el'' (tD)\n|-\n|III.2||\u0160t||''\u0161utaPRuS''||\u0161-preformative with t-infix, indicating reflexive causative|| Arabic stem X (''istaf\u2018ala'') and Aramaic ''\u2019ittaph\u2018al'' (tC)\n|-\n|IV.2||Nt||''itaPRuS'' || n-preformative with a t-infix preceding the first radical, indicating reflexive passive || rowspan='6' bgcolor='gray' |\n|-\n|I.3||Gtn||''PitaRRuS''||simple stem with tan-infix after first radical|\n|-\n|II.3||Dtn||''PutaRRuS''||doubled second radical preceded by tan-infix\n|-\n|III.3||\u0160tn|| ''\u0161utaPRuS'' ||\u0161-preformative with tan-infix\n|-\n|IV.3||Ntn||''itaPRuS''||n-preformative with tan-infix\n|-\n|||\u0160D||''\u0161uPuRRuS''||\u0161-preformative with doubled second radical\n|}\n{{reflist|group=t5}}\n\n===Stative===\nA very often appearing form which can be formed by [[noun]]s, [[adjectives]] as well as by [[predicative verb|verbal adjectives]] is the [[stative]]. [[Predicative (adjectival or nominal)|Nominal predicatives]] occur in the [[status absolutus]] and correspond to the verb \"to be\" in English. The stative in Akkadian corresponds to the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] pseudo-participle. The following table contains an example of using the noun ''\u0161arrum'' (king), the adjective ''rap\u0161um'' (wide) and the verbal adjective ''parsum'' (decided).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!''\u0161arrum''\n!''rap\u0161um''\n!''parsum''\n|-\n| '''1st Person singular''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101ku'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101ku'' || ''pars-\u0101ku''\n|-\n| '''1st Person plural''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101nu'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101nu'' || ''pars-\u0101nu''\n|-\n| '''2nd Person singular masc.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101ta'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101ta'' || ''pars-\u0101ta''\n|-\n| '''2nd Person singular fem.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101ti'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101ti'' || ''pars-\u0101ti''\n|-\n| '''2nd Person plural masc.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101tunu'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101tunu'' || ''pars-\u0101tunu''\n|-\n| '''2nd Person plural fem.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101tina'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101tina'' || ''pars-\u0101tina''\n|-\n| '''3rd Person singular masc.''' || ''\u0161ar-\u00d8'' || ''rapa\u0161-\u00d8'' || ''paris-\u00d8''\n|-\n| '''3rd Person singular fem.''' || ''\u0161arr-at'' || ''rap\u0161-at'' || ''pars-at''\n|-\n| '''3rd Person plural masc.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u016b'' || ''rap\u0161-\u016b'' || ''pars-\u016b''\n|-\n| '''3rd Person plural fem.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101'' || ''pars-\u0101''\n|-\n|}\n\nThus, the stative in Akkadian is used to convert simple stems into effective sentences, so that the form ''\u0161arr-\u0101ta'' is equivalent to: \"you were king\", \"you are king\" and \"you will be king\". Hence, the stative is independent of time forms.\n\n===Derivation===\nBeside the already explained possibility of derivation of different verb stems, Akkadian has numerous nominal formations derived from verb [[triliteral|roots]]. A very frequently encountered form is the maPRaS form. It can express the location of an event, the person performing the act and many other meanings. If one of the root consonants is [[labial consonant|labial]] (p, b, m), the [[prefix]] becomes na- (maPRaS > naPRaS).  Examples for this are: ''ma\u0161kanum'' (place, location) from \u0160KN (set, place, put), ''ma\u0161ra\u1e2bum'' (splendour) from \u0160R\u1e2a (be splendid), ''ma\u1e63\u1e63arum'' (guards) from N\u1e62R (guard), ''nap\u1e2barum'' (sum) from  P\u1e2aR (summarize).\n\nA very similar formation is the maPRaSt form. The noun derived from this nominal formation is grammatically feminine. The same rules as for the maPRaS form apply, for example ''ma\u0161kattum'' (deposit) from \u0160KN (set, place, put), ''narkabtum'' (carriage) from RKB (ride, drive, mount).\n\nThe [[suffix]] - \u016bt is used to derive [[Noun#Concrete nouns and abstract nouns|abstract nouns]]. The nouns which are formed with this suffix are grammatically feminine. The suffix can be attached to nouns, adjectives and verbs, e.g. ''ab\u016btum'' (paternity) from ''abum'' (father), ''rabutum'' (size) from ''rabum'' (large), ''wa\u1e63\u016btum'' (leaving) from W\u1e62Y (leave).\n\nAlso derivatives of verbs from nouns, adjectives and numerals are numerous. For the most part, a D-stem is derived from the root of the noun or adjective. The derived verb then has the meaning of \"make X do something\" or \"becoming X\", for example: ''du\u0161\u0161\u00fbm'' (let sprout) from ''di\u0161u'' (grass), ''\u0161ullu\u0161um'' (to do something for the third time ) from ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161'' (three).\n\n===Pronouns===\n\n====Personal pronouns====\n\n=====Independent personal pronouns=====\nIndependent [[personal pronouns]] in Akkadian are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | || colspan=2 | Nominative || colspan=2 | Oblique || colspan=2 | [[Dative]]\n|-\n!  colspan=2|Person || [[Singulative number|Singular]] || [[Plural]] || Singular || Plural || Singular || Plural\n|-\n! colspan=2|1st\n| an\u0101ku \"I\" || n\u012bnu \"we\" || y\u0101ti || ni\u0101ti || y\u0101\u0161im || ni\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n!  rowspan=2|2nd\n!<small>masculine</small>\n|  atta \"you\" ||  attunu \"you\" || k\u0101ti (k\u0101ta) || kun\u016bti ||k\u0101\u0161im || kun\u016b\u0161im\n|-\n!<small>feminine</small>\n| atti \"you\" || attina \"you\" || k\u0101ti || kin\u0101ti || k\u0101\u0161im || kin\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n! rowspan=2|3rd\n!<small>masculine</small>\n| \u0161\u016b \"he\" || \u0161unu \"they\" || \u0161\u0101tilu (\u0161\u0101tilu) || \u0161un\u016bti ||\u0161u\u0101\u0161im (\u0161\u0101\u0161im) || \u0161un\u016b\u0161im\n|-\n!<small>feminine</small>\n| \u0161\u012b \"she\" || \u0161ina \"they\" || \u0161i\u0101ti (\u0161u\u0101ti;\u0161\u0101ti) || \u0161in\u0101ti || \u0161i\u0101\u0161im (\u0161\u0101\u0161im, \u0161\u0101\u0161im) || \u0161in\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n|}\n\n=====Suffixed (or enclitic) pronouns=====\n[[Suffix]]ed (or [[enclitic]]) pronouns (mainly denoting the [[genitive]], [[accusative]] and [[dative]]) are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | || colspan=2 | Genitive || colspan=2 | Accusative || colspan=2 | [[Dative]]\n|-\n!  colspan=2|Person || [[Singulative number|singular]] || [[Plural]] || Singular || Plural || Singular || Plural\n|-\n! colspan=2|1st\n| -i, -ya <ref group=t5>-ni is used for the nominative, i.e. following a verb denoting the subject.</ref> || -ni || -ni || -ni\u0101ti || -am/-nim || -ni\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n!  rowspan=2|2nd\n!<small>masculine</small>\n|  -ka ||  -kunu || -ka || -kun\u016bti || -kum || -kun\u016b\u0161im\n|-\n!<small>feminine</small>\n| -ki || -kina || -ki || -kin\u0101ti || -kim || -kin\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n! rowspan=2|3rd\n!<small>masculine</small>\n| -\u0161\u016b  || -\u0161unu || -\u0161\u016b  || -\u0161un\u016bti || -\u0161um || -\u0161un\u016b\u0161im\n|-\n!<small>feminine</small>\n| -\u0161a || -\u0161ina || -\u0161i || -\u0161in\u0101ti || -\u0161im || -\u0161in\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n|}\n\n{{reflist|group=t5}}\n\n====Demonstrative pronouns====\n[[Demonstrative pronoun]]s in Akkadian differ from the [[West Semitic languages|Western Semitic]] variety.

There are, however, some compound prepositions which are combined with ''ina'' and ''ana'' (e.g. ''ina ma\u1e2bar'' (forwards), ''ina balu'' (without), ''ana \u1e63\u0113r'' (up to), ''ana ma\u1e2bar'' (forwards). Regardless of the complexity of the preposition, the following noun is always in the [[genitive]] [[case ending|case]].\n\nExamples: ''ina b\u012btim'' (in the house, from the house), ''ana dummuqim'' (to do good), ''itti \u0161arrim'' (with the king), ''ana \u1e63\u0113r m\u0101r\u012b\u0161u'' (up to his son).\n\n===Numerals===\nSince [[Numeral system|numeral]]s are written mostly as a number sign in the [[cuneiform]] script, the [[transliteration]] of many numerals is not well ascertained yet. Along with the counted noun, the [[cardinal number|cardinal numeral]]s are in the [[status absolutus]]. Because other cases are very rare, the forms of the [[status rectus]] are known only by isolated numerals. The numerals 1 and 2 as well as 21\u201329, 31\u201339, 41\u201349 correspond with the counted in the [[grammatical gender]], while the numerals 3\u201320, 30, 40 and 50 are characterized by [[polarity of gender]], i.e. if the counted noun is masculine, the numeral would be feminine and vice versa. This polarity is typical of the [[Semitic language]]s and appears also in [[Arabic language|classical Arabic]] for example. The numerals 60, 100 and 1000 do not change according to the gender of the counted noun. Counted nouns more than two appear in the plural form. However, body parts which occur in pairs appear in the [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form  in Akkadian. e.g. ''\u0161epum'' (foot) becomes ''\u0161ep\u0101n'' (two feet).\n\nThe [[ordinal number|ordinal]]s are formed (with a few exceptions) by adding a [[case ending]] to the nominal form PaRuS (the P, R and S. must be substituted with the suitable consonants of the numeral). It is noted, however, that in the case of the numeral \"one\", the ordinal (masculine) and the cardinal number are the same. A [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] occurs in the numeral \"four\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|+Akkadian numbers<ref>Huehnergard, 3rd ed., \u00a723.2</ref>\n!rowspan=3|#\n!colspan=4|Cardinal \n!Congruence \n!colspan=2|Ordinal\n|-\n!colspan=2|<small>(masculine)</small>\n!colspan=2|<small>(feminine)</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>(Gender agreement of the cardinal numeral)</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>(masculine)</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>(feminine)</small>\n|-\n!<small>(absolute)</small>\n!<small>(free)</small>\n!<small>(absolute)</small>\n!<small>(free)</small>\n|-\n| align='left' | 1 || ''i\u0161t\u0113n'' || (''i\u0161t\u0113num'') || ''i\u0161teat'', ''i\u0161t\u0113t'' || (''i\u0161t\u0113tum'') || Congruent (no gender polarity) || ''p\u0101n\u00fbm''<br>''ma\u1e2br\u00fbm''<br>(''i\u0161t\u012b\u02beum'')<br>''i\u0161t\u0113n'' || ''p\u0101n\u012btum''<br>''ma\u1e2br\u012btum''<br>(''i\u0161t\u012btum'')<br>''i\u0161teat''\n|-\n| align='left' | 2 || ''\u0161in\u0101'' || \u2014 || ''\u0161itt\u0101'' || \u2014 || Congruent || ''\u0161an\u00fbm'' || ''\u0161an\u012btum''\n|-\n| align='left' | 3 || ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161at'' || ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161tum'' || ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161'' || ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161um'' || Gender polarity || ''\u0161al\u0161um'' || ''\u0161alu\u0161tum''\n|-\n| align='left' | 4 || ''erbet(ti)'' || ''erbettum'' || ''erbe'', ''erba'' || ''erb\u00fbm'' || Gender polarity || ''reb\u00fbm'' || ''reb\u016btum''\n|-\n| align='left' | 5 || ''\u1e2bam\u0161at'' || ''\u1e2bami\u0161tum'' || ''\u1e2bami\u0161'' || ''\u1e2bam\u0161um'' || Gender polarity || ''\u1e2bam\u0161um'' || ''\u1e2bamu\u0161tum''\n|-\n| align='left' | 6 || ''\u0161e\u0161\u0161et'' || ''\u0161edi\u0161tum'' || ''\u0161edi\u0161''?

(Modern [[South Semitic]] languages in [[Ethiopia]] also have SOV order, but these developed within historical times from the classical [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] (VSO) language [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]].) It has been hypothesized that this word order was a result of influence from the [[Sumerian language]], which was also SOV. There is evidence that native speakers of both languages were in intimate language contact, forming a single society for at least 500 years, so it is entirely likely that a [[sprachbund]] could have formed.{{sfn | Deutscher | 2000 | p=21}} Further evidence of an original VSO or SVO ordering can be found in the fact that direct and indirect object pronouns are suffixed to the verb.  Word order seems to have shifted to SVO/VSO late in the 1st millennium BC to the 1st millennium AD, possibly under the influence of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]].\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe Akkadian vocabulary is mostly of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] origin. Although classified as '[[East Semitic]]', many elements of its basic vocabulary find no evident parallels in related Semitic languages. For example: ''m\u0101ru'' 'son' (Semitic *bn), ''q\u0101tu'' 'hand' (Semitic *yd), ''\u0161\u0113pu'' 'foot' (Semitic *rgl), ''qab\u00fb'' 'say' (Semitic *qwl), ''izuzzu'' 'stand' (Semitic *qwm), ''ana'' 'to, for' (Semitic *li).\n\nDue to extensive contact with Sumerian and [[Aramaic]], the Akkadian vocabulary contains many loan words from these languages. Aramaic loan words, however, were limited to the 1st centuries of the 1st millennium BC and primarily in the north and middle parts of [[Mesopotamia]], whereas Sumerian loan words were spread in the whole linguistic area. Beside the previous languages, some nouns were borrowed from [[Hurrian]], [[Kassite language|Kassite]], [[Ugaritic]] and other ancient languages.\nSince Sumerian and Hurrian, two non-Semitic languages, differ from Akkadian in word structure, only nouns and some adjectives (not many verbs) were borrowed from these languages. However, some verbs were borrowed (along with many nouns) from Aramaic and Ugaritic, both of which are Semitic languages.\n\nThe following table contains examples of loan words in Akkadian:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Akkadian\n!Meaning\n!Source\n!Word in the language of origin\n|-\n| ''d\u00fb'' || hill || Sumerian || ''du''\n|-\n| ''er\u0113qu'' || flee || Aramaic || ''\u02bfRQ'' ([[Triliteral|root]])\n|-\n| ''gadal\u00fb'' || dressed in linen || Sumerian || ''gada l\u00e1''\n|-\n| ''isinnu'' || firmly || Sumerian || ''ezen''\n|-\n| ''kasulat\u1e2bu'' || a device of copper || Hurrian || ''kasulat\u1e2b-''\n|-\n| ''kisallu'' || court || Sumerian || ''kisal''\n|-\n| ''laq\u0101\u1e2bu'' || take || Ugaritic || ''LQ\u1e24''([[Triliteral|root]])\n|-\n| ''para\u0161\u0161annu'' || part of horse riding gear || Hurrian || ''para\u0161\u0161ann-''\n|-\n| ''purkullu'' || stone cutter || Sumerian || ''bur-gul''\n|-\n| ''qa\u1e6d\u0101lu'' || kill || Aramaic || ''Q\u1e6cL'' ([[Triliteral|root]])\n|-\n| ''uri\u1e2bullu'' || conventional penalty || Hurrian || ''uri\u1e2bull-''\n|-\n|}\nAkkadian was also a source of borrowing to other languages, above all [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. Some examples are: Sumerian ''da-ri'' ('lastingly', from Akkadian ''d\u0101ru''), Sumerian ''ra gaba'' ('riders, messenger', from Akkadian ''r\u0101kibu'').\n\n==Sample text==\nThe following is the 7th section of the [[Code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi law code]], written in the mid-18th century BC:\n\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| \u0161umma aw\u012bl-um l\u016b kasp-am l\u016b \u1e2bur\u0101\u1e63-am l\u016b ward-am l\u016b amt-am\n| if man-NOM or silver-ACC or gold-ACC or slave-M.ACC or slave-F.ACC\n|}}\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| l\u016b alp-am l\u016b immer-am l\u016b im\u0113r-am \u016b l\u016b {mimma \u0161um\u0161u} ina\n| or cattle/oxen-ACC or sheep-ACC or donkey-ACC and or something from\n|}}\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| q\u0101t m\u0101r aw\u012bl-im \u016b l\u016b warad aw\u012bl-im balum \u0161\u012bb-\u012b u\n| hand-{{gcl|CONST|Status Constructus|Construct state}} son-{{gcl|CONST|Status Constructus|Construct state}} man-GEN and or slave-{{gcl|CONST|Status Constructus|Construct state}} man-GEN without witnesses-GEN and\n|}}\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| riks-\u0101tim i-\u0161t\u0101m-\u00d8 \u016b l\u016b ana ma\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r\u016bt-im i-m\u1e2bur-\u00d8\n| contracts-GEN bought-3.SG.PERF and or for safekeeping-GEN received-3.SG.PRET\n|}}\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| aw\u012bl-um \u0161\u016b \u0161arr\u0101q i-dd\u0101k\n| man-NOM he-3.M.SG stealer-{{gcl|ABS|Status Absolutus|Absolute state}} is_killed-3.SG.PASS-PRS\n|}}\n\nTranslation:\n:''If a man has bought silver or gold, a male or a female slave,<br/>an ox, a sheep, or a donkey\u2014or anything for that matter\u2014<br/>from another man or from another man\u2019s slave without witnesses or contract,<br/>or if he accepted something for safekeeping without same,<br/>then this man is a thief and hence to be killed.''\n\n==Akkadian literature==\n{{Portal|Asia}}\n{{Main|Akkadian literature}}\n*[[Atrahasis Epic]] (early 2nd millennium BC)\n*[[En\u00fbma Elish]] (c. 18th century BC)\n*[[Amarna letters]] (14th century BC)\n*[[Epic of Gilgamesh]] ([[Sin-liqe-unninni]]', Standard Babylonian version, 13th to 11th century BC)\n*[[Ludlul b\u0113l n\u0113meqi|Ludlul Bel Nemeqi]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*Aro, Jussi (1957).

In total, hundreds of thousands of texts and text fragments have been excavated, covering a vast textual tradition of mythological narrative, legal texts, scientific works, correspondence, political and military events, and many other examples. \n\nAkkadian (in its Assyrian and Babylonian varieties) was the native language of the Mesopotamian empires ([[Akkadian Empire]], [[Old Assyrian Empire]], [[Babylonia]], [[Middle Assyrian Empire]]) throughout the later Bronze Age, and Akkadian became the [[lingua franca]] of much of the Ancient [[Near East]] by the time of the [[Bronze Age collapse]]. Its decline began in the Iron Age,   during the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], by about the 8th century BC ([[Tiglath-Pileser III]]), \nin favour of [[Old Aramaic language|Old Aramaic]].  By the [[Hellenistic period]], the language was largely confined to scholars and priests working in temples in Assyria and Babylonia.

Akkadian and its successor Aramaic, however, are only ever attested in Mesopotamia and the Near East.\n\nWithin the Near Eastern Semitic languages, Akkadian forms an [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic]] subgroup (with [[Eblaite language|Eblaite]]). This group distinguishes itself from the Northwest and South Semitic languages by its [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] word order, while the other Semitic languages usually have either a [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] or [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] order. This novel word order is due to the influence of the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] substratum, which has an SOV order.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAdditionally Akkadian is the only Semitic language to use the [[preposition and postposition|preposition]]s ''ina'' and ''ana'' ([[locative case]], English ''in''/''on''/''with'', and [[dative case|dative]]-locative case, ''for''/''to'', respectively). Other Semitic languages like [[Arabic]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] have the prepositions ''bi/b\u0259'' and ''li/l\u0259'' (locative and dative, respectively). The origin of the Akkadian spatial prepositions is unknown.\n\nIn contrast to most other Semitic languages, Akkadian has only one non-sibilant [[fricative consonant|fricative]]: '''\u1e2b''' {{IPA|[x]}}. Akkadian lost both the [[glottal consonant|glottal]] and [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] fricatives, which are characteristic of the other Semitic languages. Until the Old Babylonian period, the Akkadian [[sibilant]]s were exclusively [[affricate consonant|affricated]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History and writing==\n\n===Writing===\n{{Main|Akkadian cuneiform}}\n[[Image:AkkadischLand.png|200px|thumb|[[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform writing]] (Neoassyrian script)<br />(1 = Logogram (LG) \"mix\"/syllabogram (SG) ''{{IPA|\u1e2bi}}'',<br />2 = LG \"moat\",<br />3 = SG ''{{IPA|a\u02be}}'',<br />4 = SG ''{{IPA|a\u1e2b}}, {{IPA|e\u1e2b}}, {{IPA|i\u1e2b}}, {{IPA|u\u1e2b}}'',<br />5 = SG ''kam'',<br />6 = SG ''im'',<br />7 = SG ''bir'')]]\nOld Akkadian is preserved on clay tablets dating back to c. 2500 BC. It was written using [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]], a script adopted from the Sumerians using wedge-shaped symbols pressed in wet clay. As employed by Akkadian scribes, the adapted cuneiform script could represent either (a) [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[logogram]]s (''i.e.'', picture-based characters representing entire words), (b) Sumerian syllables, (c) Akkadian syllables, or (d) [[phonetic complement]]s. However, in Akkadian the script practically became a fully fledged [[Syllabary|syllabic script]], and the original [[Logogram|logographic]] nature of cuneiform became secondary, though logograms for frequent words such as 'god' and 'temple' continued to be used. For this reason, the sign ''AN'' can on the one hand be a logogram for the word ''ilum'' ('god') and on the other signify the god [[Anu]] or even the syllable ''-an-''. Additionally, this sign was used as a [[determinative]] for divine names.\n\nAnother peculiarity of Akkadian cuneiform is that many signs do not have a well-defined phonetic value. Certain signs, such as ''{{transl|sem|A\u1e2a}}'', do not distinguish between the different [[vowel]] qualities. Nor is there any coordination in the other direction; the syllable ''{{transl|sem|-\u0161a-}}'', for example, is rendered by the sign ''{{transl|sem|\u0160A}}'', but also by the sign ''{{transl|sem|N\u012a\u011c}}''. Both of these are often used for the same syllable in the same text.\n\nCuneiform was in many ways unsuited to Akkadian: among its flaws was its inability to represent important [[phonemes]] in Semitic, including a [[glottal stop]], [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeals]], and [[emphatic consonant]]s. In addition, cuneiform was a [[syllabary]] writing system\u2014i.e., a consonant plus vowel comprised one writing unit\u2014frequently inappropriate for a Semitic language made up of [[Triliteral|triconsonantal root]]s (i.e., three consonants plus any vowels).\n\n===Development===\nAkkadian is divided into several [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] based on [[geography]] and [[historical period]]:<ref>Caplice, p.5 (1980)</ref>\n*Old Akkadian, 2500\u20131950 BC\n*Old Babylonian and Old Assyrian, 1950\u20131530 BC\n*Middle Babylonian and Middle Assyrian, 1530\u20131000 BC\n*Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian, 1000\u2013600 BC\n*Late Babylonian, 600 BC\u2013100 AD\n[[File:Antiochus cylinder.jpg|thumb|left|Cylinder of Hellenistic king [[Antiochus I]] (r.281\u2013261 BC), as great king of kings of [[Babylon]], restorer of gods [[Esagila|E-sagila]] and [[E-zida]].

During the [[Middle Bronze Age]] (Old Assyrian and Old Babylonian period), the language virtually displaced Sumerian, which is assumed to have been extinct as a living language by the 18th century BC.\n\nOld Akkadian, which was used until the end of the 3rd millennium BC, differed from both Babylonian and Assyrian, and was displaced by these dialects. By the 21st century BC Babylonian and Assyrian, which were to become the primary dialects, were easily distinguishable. Old Babylonian, along with the closely related dialect [[Mari, Syria|Mariotic]], is clearly more innovative than the Old Assyrian dialect and the more distantly related [[Eblaite language]]. For this reason, forms like ''lu-prus'' ('I will decide') were first encountered in Old Babylonian instead of the older ''la-prus''. While generally more archaic, Assyrian developed certain innovations as well, such as the \"Assyrian [[vowel harmony]]\". Eblaite was even more so, retaining a productive [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] and a [[relative pronoun]] declined in case, number and gender. Both of these had already disappeared in Old Akkadian. Over 20,000 cuneiform tablets in Old Akkadian have been recovered from the [[K\u00fcltepe]] site in [[Anatolia]]. Most of the archaeological evidence is typical of Anatolia rather than of Assyria, but the use both of [[cuneiform]] and the dialect is the best indication of Assyrian presence.<ref>K. R. Veenhof, Ankara Kultepe Tabletleri V, Turk Tarih Kurumu, 2010, {{ISBN|978-975-16-2235-8}}</ref>\n\nOld Babylonian was the language of king [[Hammurabi]] and his [[Code of Hammurabi|code]], which is one of the oldest collections of laws in the world. (see [[Code of Ur-Nammu]].) The Middle Babylonian (or Assyrian) period started in the 16th century BC. The division is marked by the [[Kassites|Kassite]] invasion of Babylonia around 1550 BC. The Kassites, who reigned for 300 years, gave up their own language in favor of Akkadian, but they had little influence on the language. At its apogee, Middle Babylonian was the written language of diplomacy of the entire [[Ancient Near East]], including Egypt. During this period, a large number of loan words were included in the language from [[Northwest Semitic languages]] and [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]]; however, the use of these words was confined to the fringes of the Akkadian-speaking territory.\n\nMiddle Assyrian served as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in much of the [[Ancient Near East]] of the [[Late Bronze Age]] ([[Amarna Period]]). During the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], Neo-Assyrian began to turn into a chancellery language, being marginalized by [[Old Aramaic]]. Under the [[Achaemenids]], Aramaic continued to prosper, but Assyrian continued its decline. The language's final demise came about during the [[Hellenistic period]] when it was further marginalized by [[Koine Greek]], even though Neo-Assyrian cuneiform remained in use in literary tradition well into [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] times. The latest known text in cuneiform Babylonian is an astronomical almanac dated to 79/80 AD.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hunger |first1=Hermann |last2=de Jong |first2=Teije |title=Almanac W22340a From Uruk: The Latest Datable Cuneiform Tablet |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Assyriologie und vorderasiatische Arch\u00e4ologie |date=30 January 2014 |volume=104 |issue=2 |doi=10.1515/za-2014-0015}}</ref> However, the latest cuneiform texts are almost entirely written in Sumerian logograms.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walker |first1=C.

From 1500 BC onwards, the language is termed Middle Assyrian.\n\nDuring the first millennium BC, Akkadian progressively lost its status as a ''lingua franca''. In the beginning, from around 1000 BC, Akkadian and [[Aramaic]] were of equal status, as can be seen in the number of copied texts: clay tablets were written in Akkadian, while scribes writing on papyrus and leather used Aramaic. From this period on, one speaks of [[Neo-Babylonian]] and [[Neo-Assyrian]]. Neo-Assyrian received an upswing in popularity in the 10th century BC when the Assyrian kingdom became a major power with the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], but texts written 'exclusively' in Neo-Assyrian disappear within 10 years of [[Nineveh]]'s destruction in 612 BC. The dominance of the Neo-Assyrian Empire under [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] over [[Aram-Damascus]] in the middle of the 8th century led to the establishment of Aramaic as a ''lingua franca''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sejongjul.org/archive/view_article?pid=jul-5-1-1|title=Aramaic as a Lingua Franca During the Persian Empire (538-333 B.C.E.)|last=Bae|first=Chul-hyun|date=2004|website=Journal of Universal Language|doi=10.22425/jul.2004.5.1.1|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref> of the empire, rather than it being eclipsed by Akkadian.\n\nAfter the end of the Mesopotamian kingdoms, which were conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], Akkadian (which existed solely in the form of Late Babylonian) disappeared as a popular language. However, the language was still used in its written form; and even after the Greek invasion under [[Alexander the Great]] in the 4th century BC, Akkadian was still a contender as a written language, but spoken Akkadian was likely extinct by this time, or at least rarely used.  The last positively identified Akkadian text comes from the 1st century AD.<ref>John Huehnergard & Christopher Woods, 2004 \"Akkadian and Eblaite\", ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages'', pg. 218.</ref>\n\n===Decipherment===\n[[File:Georg Friedrich Grotefend.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]]]]\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center\n | total_width       = 275\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Edward Hincks.jpg\n | width1            = 600\n | height1           = 728\n | alt1              =\n | link1             =\n | caption1          = [[Edward Hincks]]\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            = Henry Creswicke Rawlinson.jpg\n | width2            = 1274\n | height2           = 1600\n | alt2              =\n | link2             =\n | caption2          = [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Rawlinson]]\n}}\nThe Akkadian language began to be rediscovered when [[Carsten Niebuhr]] in 1767 was able to make extensive copies of cuneiform texts and published them in Denmark. The deciphering of the texts started immediately, and bilinguals, in particular [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]]-Akkadian bilinguals, were of great help. Since the texts contained several royal names, isolated signs could be identified, and were presented in 1802 by [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]]. By this time it was already evident that Akkadian was a Semitic language, and the final breakthrough in deciphering the language came from [[Edward Hincks]], [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] and [[Jules Oppert]] in the middle of the 19th century.  The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago recently completed a 21-volume dictionary of the Akkadian language, which is available commercially and [http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/assyrian-dictionary-oriental-institute-university-chicago-cad online].<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13715296 | title=Dictionary 90 years in the making| work=BBC News| date=2011-06-14| last1=Hebblethwaite| first1=Cordelia}}</ref>\n[[Image:GilgameshTablet.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[deluge (mythology)|Deluge]] tablet of the [[Gilgamesh]] epic in Akkadian.]]\n\n===Dialects===\nThe following table summarises the dialects of Akkadian identified with certainty so far.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+ Known Akkadian dialects\n !

Sommerfeld 2003) believe that the Old Akkadian variant used in the older texts is not an ancestor of the later Assyrian and Babylonian dialects, but rather a separate dialect that was replaced by these two dialects and which died out early.\n\n[[Eblaite language|Eblaite]], formerly thought of as yet another Akkadian dialect, is now generally considered a separate East Semitic language.\n\n==Phonetics and phonology==\n{{anchor|Phonology}}\nBecause Akkadian as a spoken language is extinct and no contemporary descriptions of the pronunciation are known, little can be said with certainty about the [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] of Akkadian. Some conclusions can be made, however, due to the relationship to the other [[Semitic language]]s and variant spellings of Akkadian words.\n\n===Consonants===\n\nThe following table gives the [[consonant]] sounds distinguished in the Akkadian use of cuneiform, with the presumed pronunciation in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription according to Huehnergard and Woods,<ref name=\":0\" /> which most closely corresponds to recent reconstructions of [[Proto-Semitic language|Proto-Semitic phonology]]. The parenthesised symbol following is the transcription used in the literature, in the cases where that symbol is different from the phonetic symbol.

For the sibilants, traditionally /\u0161/ has been held to be postalveolar {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, and /s/, /z/, /{{transl|sem|\u1e63}}/ analyzed as fricatives; but attested [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilations]] in Akkadian suggest otherwise.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Kogan, Leonid (2011). \"Proto-Semitic Phonetics and Phonology\". In Semitic languages: an international handbook, Stefan Weninger, ed. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. p. 68.</ref> For example, when the possessive suffix ''-\u0161u'' is added to the root ''awat'' ('word'), it is written ''awassu'' ('his word') even though ''\u0161\u0161'' would be expected. The most straightforward interpretation of this shift from ''t\u0161'' to ''ss'' is that /s, \u1e63/ form a pair of voiceless alveolar affricates {{IPA|[t\u0361s t\u0361s\u02bc]}}, *\u0161 is a voiceless alveolar fricative {{IPA|[s]}}, and *z is a voiced alveolar affricate or fricative {{IPA|[d\u0361z~z]}}. The assimilation is then [awat+su] > {{IPA|[awatt\u0361su]}}. In this vein, an alternative transcription of *\u0161 is *s\u0320, with the macron below indicating a soft (lenis) articulation in Semitic transcription. Other interpretations are possible, however. {{IPA|[\u0283]}} could have been assimilated to the preceding {{IPA|[t]}}, yielding {{IPA|[ts]}}, which would later have been simplified to {{IPA|[ss]}}.\n\nThe phoneme /r/ has traditionally been interpreted as a trill but its pattern of alternation with /{{transl|ar|DIN|\u1e2b}}/ suggests it was a velar (or uvular) fricative. In the Hellenistic period, Akkadian /r/ was transcribed using the Greek \u03c1, indicating it was pronounced similarly as an [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar trills|alveolar trill]] (though Greeks may also have perceived a [[uvular trill]] as \u03c1).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Descent from Proto-Semitic ===\nSeveral [[Proto-Semitic]] phonemes are lost in Akkadian. The Proto-Semitic glottal stop {{transl|sem|[[Aleph (letter)|*\u02be]], as well as the fricatives [[Ayin|*\u02bf]]}}, {{transl|sem|[[He (letter)|*h]], [[Heth (letter)|*\u1e25]]}} are lost as consonants, either by sound change or orthographically, but they gave rise to the vowel quality ''e'' not exhibited in Proto-Semitic. The [[voiceless lateral fricatives]] ({{transl|sem|[[\u015aawt|*\u015b]], [[\u1e0c\u0101d|*\u1e63\u0301]]}}) merged with the sibilants as in [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]], leaving 19 consonantal phonemes.

(section on vowels and semi-vowels)</ref> There is limited contrast between different u-signs in lexical texts, but this scribal differentiation may reflect the superimposition of the Sumerian phonological system (for which an /o/ phoneme has also been proposed), rather than a separate phoneme in Akkadian.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Akkadian and Eblaite|url = https://www.academia.edu/6933497|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-19|last = Huehnergard & Woods|page = 233}}</ref>\n\nAll consonants and [[vowel]]s appear in long and short forms. Long consonants are represented in writing as double consonants, and long vowels are written with a macron (\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u016b). This distinction is [[phoneme|phonemic]], and is used in the grammar, for example ''iprusu'' ('that he decided') versus ''iprus\u016b'' ('they decided').\n\n===Stress===\nThe [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] patterns of Akkadian are disputed, with some authors claiming that nothing is known of the topic. There are however certain points of reference, such as the rule of vowel syncope, and some forms in the cuneiform that might represent the stressing of certain vowels; however, attempts at identifying a rule for stress have so far been unsuccessful.\n\nHuenergard (2005:3-4) claims that stress in Akkadian is completely predictable. In his syllable typology there are three syllable weights: ''light'' (V, CV); ''heavy'' (CVC, CV\u0304, CV\u0302), and ''superheavy'' (CV\u0302C). If the last syllable is superheavy, it is stressed, otherwise the rightmost heavy non-final syllable is stressed. If a word contains only light syllables, the first syllable is stressed.\n\nA rule of Akkadian phonology is that certain short (and probably unstressed) vowels are dropped. The rule is that the last vowel of a succession of syllables that end in a short vowel is dropped, for example the declinational root of the verbal adjective of a root PRS is ''PaRiS-''. Thus the masculine singular nominative is ''PaRS-um'' (< ''*PaRiS-um'') but the feminine singular nominative is ''PaRiStum'' (< ''*PaRiS-at-um''). Additionally there is a general tendency of syncope of short vowels in the later stages of Akkadian.\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Morphology===\n\n====Consonantal root====\nMost roots of the Akkadian language consist of three consonants (called the radicals), but some roots are composed of four consonants (so-called quadriradicals). The radicals are occasionally represented in transcription in upper-case letters, for example ''PRS'' (to decide). Between and around these radicals various [[infix]]es, [[suffix]]es and [[prefix]]es, having word generating or grammatical functions, are inserted. The resulting consonant-vowel pattern differentiates the original meaning of the root. Also, the middle radical can be geminated, which is represented by a doubled consonant in transcription (and sometimes in the cuneiform writing itself).\n\nThe consonants ''{{IPA|\u0294}}'', ''{{IPA|w}}'', ''{{IPA|j}}'' and ''{{IPA|n}}'' are termed \"weak radicals\" and roots containing these radicals give rise to irregular forms.\n\n==== Case, number and gender ====\nFormally, Akkadian has three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and three cases ([[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]] and [[Genitive case|genitive]]). However, even in the earlier stages of the language, the dual number is vestigial, and its use is largely confined to natural pairs (eyes, ears, etc.), and adjectives are never found in the dual. In the dual and plural, the accusative and genitive are merged into a single [[oblique case]].\n\nAkkadian, unlike [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but like [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], has only \"sound\" plurals formed by means of a plural ending (i.e. no [[broken plurals]] formed by changing the word stem). As in all Semitic languages, some masculine nouns take the prototypically feminine plural ending (''-\u0101t'').\n\nThe nouns ''\u0161arrum'' (king) and ''\u0161arratum'' (queen) and the adjective ''dannum'' (strong) will serve to illustrate the case system of Akkadian.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+ Noun and adjective paradigms\n !\n !

Certain nouns, primarily those referring to geography, can also form a locative ending in ''-um'' in the singular and the resulting forms serve as [[adverbial]]s. These forms are generally not productive, but in the Neo-Babylonian the ''um''-locative replaces several constructions with the preposition ''ina''.\n\nIn the later stages of Akkadian the [[mimation]] (word-final ''-m'') - along with [[nunation]] (dual final \"-n\") - that occurred at the end of most case endings disappeared, except in the locative. Later, the nominative and accusative singular of masculine nouns collapsed to ''-u'' and in Neo-Babylonian most word-final short vowels were dropped. As a result, case differentiation disappeared from all forms except masculine plural nouns. However many texts continued the practice of writing the case endings (although often sporadically and incorrectly). As the most important [[Language contact|contact language]] throughout this period was [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], which itself lacks case distinctions, it is possible that Akkadian's loss of cases was an areal as well as [[Phonology|phonological]] phenomenon.\n\n====Noun states and nominal sentences====\nAs is also the case in other Semitic languages, Akkadian nouns may appear in a variety of \"states\" depending on their grammatical function in a sentence. The basic form of the noun is the ''status rectus'' (the [[governed state]]), which is the form as described above, complete with case endings. In addition to this, Akkadian has the ''status absolutus'' (the [[absolute state]]) and the ''status constructus'' ([[Construct state]]). The latter is found in all other Semitic languages, while the former appears only in Akkadian and some dialects of Aramaic.\n\nThe status absolutus is characterised by the loss of a noun's case ending (e.g. ''aw\u012bl'' < ''aw\u012blum'', ''\u0161ar'' < ''\u0161arrum''). It is relatively uncommon, and is used chiefly to mark the predicate of a nominal sentence, in fixed adverbial expressions, and in expressions relating to measurements of length, weight, and the like.\n\n(1) ''Aw\u012bl-um \u0161\u016b \u0161arr\u0101q''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''Aw\u012bl-um'' || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | ''\u0161\u016b'' || Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161arr\u0101q.''\n|-\n| Man (Masculine, nominative) || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | he <small>(3rd masc. personal pronoun)</small> || Align=\"right\" | thief (status absolutus)\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' This man is a thief\n\n(2) ''\u0161arrum l\u0101 \u0161an\u0101n''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161arr-um'' || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | ''l\u0101'' || Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161an\u0101n.''\n|-\n| King <small>(Status rectus, nominative)</small> || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | not <small>(negative particle)</small> || Align=\"right\" | oppose <small>(verbal infinitive, status absolutus)</small>\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The king who cannot be rivaled\n\nThe status constructus is a great deal more common, and has a much wider range of applications. It is employed when a noun is followed by another noun in the genitive, a pronominal suffix, or a verbal clause in the subjunctive, and typically takes the ''shortest form of the noun which is phonetically possible''. In general, this amounts to the loss of case endings with short vowels, with the exception of the genitive -i in nouns preceding a pronominal suffix, hence:\n\n(3) ''m\u0101ri-\u0161u''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''m\u0101ri-\u0161u''\n|-\n| Son (status constructus) + his <small>(3rd person singular possessive pronoun) </small>\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' His son, its (masculine) son\n\nbut\n\n(4) ''m\u0101r \u0161arr-im''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''m\u0101r'' || Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161arr-im''\n|-\n| Son (Status constructus) || king (genitive singular)\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The king's son\n\nThere are numerous exceptions to this general rule, usually involving potential violations of the language's phonological limitations. Most obviously, Akkadian does not tolerate word final consonant clusters, so nouns like ''kalbum'' (dog) and ''ma\u1e2brum'' (front) would have illegal construct state forms ''*kalb'' and ''*ma\u1e2br'' unless modified. In many of these instances, the first vowel of the word is simply repeated (e.g. ''kalab'', ''ma\u1e2bar''). This rule, however, does not always hold true, especially in nouns where a short vowel has historically been elided (e.g. ''\u0161aknum'' < ''*\u0161akinum'' \"governor\"). In these cases, the lost vowel is restored in the construct state (so ''\u0161aknum'' yields ''\u0161akin'').\n\n(5) ''kalab belim''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''kalab'' || Align=\"center\" | ''bel-im''\n|-\n| dog (Status constructus) || master (genitive singular)\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The master's dog\n\n(6) ''\u0161akin \u0101lim''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''\u0161akin'' || Align=\"center\" | ''\u0101l-im''\n|-\n| Governor (Status constructus) || city (genitive singular)\n|}\n\nA genitive relation can also be expressed with the relative preposition ''\u0161a'', and the noun that the genitive phrase depends on appears in status rectus.\n\n(7) sal\u012bm\u0101tum \u0161a aw\u012bl E\u0161nunna\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''sal\u012bm\u0101tum'' || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | ''\u0161a'' || Align=\"center\" | ''aw\u012bl''|| Align=\"center\" | ''E\u0161nunna''\n|-\n| Alliances <small>(Status rectus, nominative)</small> || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | which <small>(relative particle)</small> || Align=\"right\" | man <small>(status constructus)</small> || Align=\"right\" | E\u0161nunna <small>(genitive, unmarked)</small>\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The alliances of the Ruler of E\u0161nunna (literally \"Alliances which man of E\u0161nunna (has)\")\n\nThe same preposition is also used to introduce true relative clauses, in which case the verb is placed in the subjunctive mood.\n\n(7) ''aw\u012bl-um \u0161a m\u0101t-am i-k\u0161ud-\u00d8-u''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Align=\"center\" | ''Aw\u012bl-um'' || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | ''\u0161a'' || Align=\"center\" | ''m\u0101t-am'' || Align=\"center\" | ''i-k\u0161ud-\u00d8-u''\n|-\n| Man (Masculine, nominative) || Align=\"center\" Colspan='3' | that <small>(relative pronoun)</small> || Align=\"center\" | land (singular, accusative) || Align=\"center\" | 3rd person - conquer (preterite) - singular, masculine - subjunctive\n|}\n\n'''Translation:''' The man who conquered the land\n\n====Verbal morphology====\n\n=====Verb aspects=====\nThe Akkadian verb has six [[Finite verb|finite]] [[Grammatical aspect|verb aspects]] ([[preterite]],  [[Perfective|perfect]], [[present tense|present]], [[imperative (grammar)|imperative]], [[Irrealis mood#Precative|precative]] and [[vetitive]]) and three [[Non-finite verb|infinite]] forms ([[infinitive]], [[participle]] and [[Non-finite verb|verbal adjective]]). The preterite is used for actions that are seen by the speaker as having occurred at a single point in time. The present is primarily imperfective in meaning and is used for concurrent and future actions as well as past actions with a temporal dimension. The final three finite forms are [[Injunctive mood|injunctive]] where the imperative and the precative together form a paradigm for positive commands and wishes, and the vetitive is used for negative wishes. Additionally the [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] [[Imperative mood#Indicative and prohibitive mood|prohibitive]], formed by the present form of the verb and the negative [[adverb]] l\u0101, is used to express negative commands. The infinitive of the Akkadian verb is a [[verbal noun]], and in contrast to some other languages the Akkadian infinitive can be declined in [[grammatical case|case]]. The verbal adjective is an adjectival form and designates the state or the result of the action of the verb, and consequently the exact meaning of the verbal adjective is determined by the [[semantics]] of the verb itself. The participle, which can be active or passive, is another verbal adjective and its meaning is similar to the [[English gerund]].\n\nThe following table shows the conjugation of the [[Derived stem|G-stem]] verbs derived from the root PRS (\"to decide\") in the various verb aspects of Akkadian:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n!\n!

The subjunctive is marked in forms which do not end in a vowel by the suffix -u (compare Arabic and Ugaritic subjunctives), but is otherwise unmarked. In the later stages of most dialects, the subjunctive is indistinct, as short final vowels were mostly lost\n#[[Ventive|Venitive]] or [[allative]]. The venitive is not a mood in the strictest sense, being a development of the 1st person dative pronominal suffix -am/-m/-nim. With verbs of motion, it often indicates motion towards an object or person (e.g. ''illik'', \"he went\" vs. ''illikam'', \"he came\"). However, this pattern is not consistent, even in earlier stages of the language, and its use often appears to serve a stylistic rather than morphological or lexical function.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the verb moods of verbs derived from the root PRS (\"to decide\",\"to separate\"):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!

[[Ventive|Venitive]]\n| ''iprusam'' || ''parsam''\n|}\n\n{{reflist|group=t4}}\n\n=====Verb patterns=====\nAkkadian verbs have thirteen separate [[derived stem]]s formed on each [[Triliteral|root]]. The basic, underived, stem is the G-stem (from the German Grundstamm, meaning \"basic stem\"). [[Causative]] or [[intensive]] forms are formed with the doubled D-stem, and it gets its name from the doubled-middle radical that is characteristic of this form. The doubled middle radical is also characteristic of the present, but the forms of the D-stem use the secondary conjugational affixes, so a D-form will never be identical to a form in a different stem. The \u0160-stem is formed by adding a prefix ''\u0161-'', and these forms are mostly causatives. Finally, the passive forms of the verb are in the N-stem, formed by adding a ''n-'' prefix. However the ''n-'' element is assimilated to a following consonant, so the original /n/ is only visible in a few forms.\n\nFurthermore, [[reflexive verb|reflexive]] and [[iterative]] verbal stems can be derived from each of the basic stems. The reflexive stem is formed with an infix ''-ta'', and the [[derived stems]] are therefore called Gt, Dt, \u0160t and Nt, and the preterite forms of the Xt-stem are identical to the perfects of the X-stem. Iteratives are formed with the infix ''-tan-'', giving the Gtn, Dtn, \u0160tn and Ntn. Because of the [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of ''n'', the /n/ is only seen in the present forms, and the Xtn preterite is identical to the Xt [[Dynamic verb|durative]].\n\nThe final stem is the \u0160D-stem, a form mostly attested only in poetic texts, and whose meaning is usually identical to either the \u0160-stem or the D-stem of the same verb.  It is formed with the \u0160 prefix (like the \u0160-stem) in addition to a doubled-middle radical (like the D-stem).\n\nAn alternative to this naming system is a numerical system. The basic stems are numbered using [[Roman numeral]]s so that G, D, \u0160 and N become I, II, III and IV, respectively, and the [[infix]]es are numbered using [[Arabic numeral]]s; 1 for the forms without an infix, 2 for the Xt, and 3 for the Xtn. The two numbers are separated using a solidus. As an example, the \u0160tn-stem is called III/3. The most important user of this system is the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary.\n\nThere is mandatory congruence between the subject of the sentence and the verb, and this is expressed by [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es. There are two different sets of affixes, a primary set used for the forms of the G and N-stems, and a secondary set for the D and \u0160-stems.\n\nThe stems, their nomenclature and examples of the third-person masculine singular [[Akkadian language#Stative|stative]] of the verb ''par\u0101sum'' (root PRS: 'to decide, distinguish, separate') is shown below:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n! # || Stem || Verb || Description || Correspondence\n|-\n|I.1||G||''PaRiS''||the simple stem, used for [[Transitive verbs|transitive]] and [[intransitive verbs]]|| Arabic stem I (''fa\u2018ala'') and Hebrew pa'al\n|-\n|II.1||D||''PuRRuS''||gemination of the second radical, indicating the intensive|| Arabic stem II (''fa\u2018\u2018ala'') and Hebrew ''pi\u2018el''\n|-\n|III.1||\u0160||''\u0161uPRuS''||\u0161-preformative, indicating the causative|| Arabic stem IV (''\u2019af\u2018ala'') and Hebrew ''hiph\u2018il''\n|-\n|IV.1||N||''naPRuS''||n-preformative, indicating the reflexive/passive|| Arabic stem VII (''infa\u2018ala'') and Hebrew ''niph\u2018al''\n|-\n|I.2||Gt||''PitRuS''||simple stem with t-infix after first radical, indicating reciprocal or reflexive|| Arabic stem VIII (''ifta\u2018ala'') and Aramaic ''\u2019ithpe\u2018al'' (tG)\n|-\n|II.2||Dt||''PutaRRuS''||doubled second radical preceded by infixed t, indicating intensive reflexive|| Arabic stem V (''tafa\u2018\u2018ala'') and Hebrew ''hithpa\u2018el'' (tD)\n|-\n|III.2||\u0160t||''\u0161utaPRuS''||\u0161-preformative with t-infix, indicating reflexive causative|| Arabic stem X (''istaf\u2018ala'') and Aramaic ''\u2019ittaph\u2018al'' (tC)\n|-\n|IV.2||Nt||''itaPRuS'' || n-preformative with a t-infix preceding the first radical, indicating reflexive passive || rowspan='6' bgcolor='gray' |\n|-\n|I.3||Gtn||''PitaRRuS''||simple stem with tan-infix after first radical|\n|-\n|II.3||Dtn||''PutaRRuS''||doubled second radical preceded by tan-infix\n|-\n|III.3||\u0160tn|| ''\u0161utaPRuS'' ||\u0161-preformative with tan-infix\n|-\n|IV.3||Ntn||''itaPRuS''||n-preformative with tan-infix\n|-\n|||\u0160D||''\u0161uPuRRuS''||\u0161-preformative with doubled second radical\n|}\n{{reflist|group=t5}}\n\n===Stative===\nA very often appearing form which can be formed by [[noun]]s, [[adjectives]] as well as by [[predicative verb|verbal adjectives]] is the [[stative]]. [[Predicative (adjectival or nominal)|Nominal predicatives]] occur in the [[status absolutus]] and correspond to the verb \"to be\" in English. The stative in Akkadian corresponds to the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] pseudo-participle. The following table contains an example of using the noun ''\u0161arrum'' (king), the adjective ''rap\u0161um'' (wide) and the verbal adjective ''parsum'' (decided).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!''\u0161arrum''\n!''rap\u0161um''\n!''parsum''\n|-\n| '''1st Person singular''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101ku'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101ku'' || ''pars-\u0101ku''\n|-\n| '''1st Person plural''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101nu'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101nu'' || ''pars-\u0101nu''\n|-\n| '''2nd Person singular masc.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101ta'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101ta'' || ''pars-\u0101ta''\n|-\n| '''2nd Person singular fem.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101ti'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101ti'' || ''pars-\u0101ti''\n|-\n| '''2nd Person plural masc.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101tunu'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101tunu'' || ''pars-\u0101tunu''\n|-\n| '''2nd Person plural fem.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101tina'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101tina'' || ''pars-\u0101tina''\n|-\n| '''3rd Person singular masc.''' || ''\u0161ar-\u00d8'' || ''rapa\u0161-\u00d8'' || ''paris-\u00d8''\n|-\n| '''3rd Person singular fem.''' || ''\u0161arr-at'' || ''rap\u0161-at'' || ''pars-at''\n|-\n| '''3rd Person plural masc.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u016b'' || ''rap\u0161-\u016b'' || ''pars-\u016b''\n|-\n| '''3rd Person plural fem.''' || ''\u0161arr-\u0101'' || ''rap\u0161-\u0101'' || ''pars-\u0101''\n|-\n|}\n\nThus, the stative in Akkadian is used to convert simple stems into effective sentences, so that the form ''\u0161arr-\u0101ta'' is equivalent to: \"you were king\", \"you are king\" and \"you will be king\". Hence, the stative is independent of time forms.\n\n===Derivation===\nBeside the already explained possibility of derivation of different verb stems, Akkadian has numerous nominal formations derived from verb [[triliteral|roots]]. A very frequently encountered form is the maPRaS form. It can express the location of an event, the person performing the act and many other meanings. If one of the root consonants is [[labial consonant|labial]] (p, b, m), the [[prefix]] becomes na- (maPRaS > naPRaS).  Examples for this are: ''ma\u0161kanum'' (place, location) from \u0160KN (set, place, put), ''ma\u0161ra\u1e2bum'' (splendour) from \u0160R\u1e2a (be splendid), ''ma\u1e63\u1e63arum'' (guards) from N\u1e62R (guard), ''nap\u1e2barum'' (sum) from  P\u1e2aR (summarize).\n\nA very similar formation is the maPRaSt form. The noun derived from this nominal formation is grammatically feminine. The same rules as for the maPRaS form apply, for example ''ma\u0161kattum'' (deposit) from \u0160KN (set, place, put), ''narkabtum'' (carriage) from RKB (ride, drive, mount).\n\nThe [[suffix]] - \u016bt is used to derive [[Noun#Concrete nouns and abstract nouns|abstract nouns]]. The nouns which are formed with this suffix are grammatically feminine. The suffix can be attached to nouns, adjectives and verbs, e.g. ''ab\u016btum'' (paternity) from ''abum'' (father), ''rabutum'' (size) from ''rabum'' (large), ''wa\u1e63\u016btum'' (leaving) from W\u1e62Y (leave).\n\nAlso derivatives of verbs from nouns, adjectives and numerals are numerous. For the most part, a D-stem is derived from the root of the noun or adjective. The derived verb then has the meaning of \"make X do something\" or \"becoming X\", for example: ''du\u0161\u0161\u00fbm'' (let sprout) from ''di\u0161u'' (grass), ''\u0161ullu\u0161um'' (to do something for the third time ) from ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161'' (three).\n\n===Pronouns===\n\n====Personal pronouns====\n\n=====Independent personal pronouns=====\nIndependent [[personal pronouns]] in Akkadian are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | || colspan=2 | Nominative || colspan=2 | Oblique || colspan=2 | [[Dative]]\n|-\n!  colspan=2|Person || [[Singulative number|Singular]] || [[Plural]] || Singular || Plural || Singular || Plural\n|-\n! colspan=2|1st\n| an\u0101ku \"I\" || n\u012bnu \"we\" || y\u0101ti || ni\u0101ti || y\u0101\u0161im || ni\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n!  rowspan=2|2nd\n!<small>masculine</small>\n|  atta \"you\" ||  attunu \"you\" || k\u0101ti (k\u0101ta) || kun\u016bti ||k\u0101\u0161im || kun\u016b\u0161im\n|-\n!<small>feminine</small>\n| atti \"you\" || attina \"you\" || k\u0101ti || kin\u0101ti || k\u0101\u0161im || kin\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n! rowspan=2|3rd\n!<small>masculine</small>\n| \u0161\u016b \"he\" || \u0161unu \"they\" || \u0161\u0101tilu (\u0161\u0101tilu) || \u0161un\u016bti ||\u0161u\u0101\u0161im (\u0161\u0101\u0161im) || \u0161un\u016b\u0161im\n|-\n!<small>feminine</small>\n| \u0161\u012b \"she\" || \u0161ina \"they\" || \u0161i\u0101ti (\u0161u\u0101ti;\u0161\u0101ti) || \u0161in\u0101ti || \u0161i\u0101\u0161im (\u0161\u0101\u0161im, \u0161\u0101\u0161im) || \u0161in\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n|}\n\n=====Suffixed (or enclitic) pronouns=====\n[[Suffix]]ed (or [[enclitic]]) pronouns (mainly denoting the [[genitive]], [[accusative]] and [[dative]]) are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | || colspan=2 | Genitive || colspan=2 | Accusative || colspan=2 | [[Dative]]\n|-\n!  colspan=2|Person || [[Singulative number|singular]] || [[Plural]] || Singular || Plural || Singular || Plural\n|-\n! colspan=2|1st\n| -i, -ya <ref group=t5>-ni is used for the nominative, i.e. following a verb denoting the subject.</ref> || -ni || -ni || -ni\u0101ti || -am/-nim || -ni\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n!  rowspan=2|2nd\n!<small>masculine</small>\n|  -ka ||  -kunu || -ka || -kun\u016bti || -kum || -kun\u016b\u0161im\n|-\n!<small>feminine</small>\n| -ki || -kina || -ki || -kin\u0101ti || -kim || -kin\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n! rowspan=2|3rd\n!<small>masculine</small>\n| -\u0161\u016b  || -\u0161unu || -\u0161\u016b  || -\u0161un\u016bti || -\u0161um || -\u0161un\u016b\u0161im\n|-\n!<small>feminine</small>\n| -\u0161a || -\u0161ina || -\u0161i || -\u0161in\u0101ti || -\u0161im || -\u0161in\u0101\u0161im\n|-\n|}\n\n{{reflist|group=t5}}\n\n====Demonstrative pronouns====\n[[Demonstrative pronoun]]s in Akkadian differ from the [[West Semitic languages|Western Semitic]] variety.

However, only the form ''\u0161a'' (originally accusative masculine singular) survived, while the other forms disappeared in time.\n\n====Interrogative pronouns====\nThe following table shows the [[Interrogative pronouns]] used in Akkadian:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Akkadian\n! English\n|-\n| ''mannu''||who?\n|-\n| ''m\u012bn\u016b''||what?\n|-\n| ''ayyu''||which?\n|-\n|}\n\n===Prepositions===\nAkkadian has [[preposition]]s which consist mainly of only one word. For example: ''ina'' (in, on, out, through, under), ''ana'' (to, for, after, approximately), ''adi'' (to), ''a\u0161\u0161u'' (because of), ''eli'' (up, over), ''i\u0161tu/ultu'' (of, since), ''mala'' (in accordance with), ''itti'' (also, with). There are, however, some compound prepositions which are combined with ''ina'' and ''ana'' (e.g. ''ina ma\u1e2bar'' (forwards), ''ina balu'' (without), ''ana \u1e63\u0113r'' (up to), ''ana ma\u1e2bar'' (forwards). Regardless of the complexity of the preposition, the following noun is always in the [[genitive]] [[case ending|case]].\n\nExamples: ''ina b\u012btim'' (in the house, from the house), ''ana dummuqim'' (to do good), ''itti \u0161arrim'' (with the king), ''ana \u1e63\u0113r m\u0101r\u012b\u0161u'' (up to his son).\n\n===Numerals===\nSince [[Numeral system|numeral]]s are written mostly as a number sign in the [[cuneiform]] script, the [[transliteration]] of many numerals is not well ascertained yet. Along with the counted noun, the [[cardinal number|cardinal numeral]]s are in the [[status absolutus]]. Because other cases are very rare, the forms of the [[status rectus]] are known only by isolated numerals. The numerals 1 and 2 as well as 21\u201329, 31\u201339, 41\u201349 correspond with the counted in the [[grammatical gender]], while the numerals 3\u201320, 30, 40 and 50 are characterized by [[polarity of gender]], i.e. if the counted noun is masculine, the numeral would be feminine and vice versa. This polarity is typical of the [[Semitic language]]s and appears also in [[Arabic language|classical Arabic]] for example. The numerals 60, 100 and 1000 do not change according to the gender of the counted noun. Counted nouns more than two appear in the plural form. However, body parts which occur in pairs appear in the [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form  in Akkadian. e.g. ''\u0161epum'' (foot) becomes ''\u0161ep\u0101n'' (two feet).\n\nThe [[ordinal number|ordinal]]s are formed (with a few exceptions) by adding a [[case ending]] to the nominal form PaRuS (the P, R and S. must be substituted with the suitable consonants of the numeral). It is noted, however, that in the case of the numeral \"one\", the ordinal (masculine) and the cardinal number are the same. A [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] occurs in the numeral \"four\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|+Akkadian numbers<ref>Huehnergard, 3rd ed., \u00a723.2</ref>\n!rowspan=3|#\n!colspan=4|Cardinal \n!Congruence \n!colspan=2|Ordinal\n|-\n!colspan=2|<small>(masculine)</small>\n!colspan=2|<small>(feminine)</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>(Gender agreement of the cardinal numeral)</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>(masculine)</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>(feminine)</small>\n|-\n!<small>(absolute)</small>\n!<small>(free)</small>\n!<small>(absolute)</small>\n!<small>(free)</small>\n|-\n| align='left' | 1 || ''i\u0161t\u0113n'' || (''i\u0161t\u0113num'') || ''i\u0161teat'', ''i\u0161t\u0113t'' || (''i\u0161t\u0113tum'') || Congruent (no gender polarity) || ''p\u0101n\u00fbm''<br>''ma\u1e2br\u00fbm''<br>(''i\u0161t\u012b\u02beum'')<br>''i\u0161t\u0113n'' || ''p\u0101n\u012btum''<br>''ma\u1e2br\u012btum''<br>(''i\u0161t\u012btum'')<br>''i\u0161teat''\n|-\n| align='left' | 2 || ''\u0161in\u0101'' || \u2014 || ''\u0161itt\u0101'' || \u2014 || Congruent || ''\u0161an\u00fbm'' || ''\u0161an\u012btum''\n|-\n| align='left' | 3 || ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161at'' || ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161tum'' || ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161'' || ''\u0161al\u0101\u0161um'' || Gender polarity || ''\u0161al\u0161um'' || ''\u0161alu\u0161tum''\n|-\n| align='left' | 4 || ''erbet(ti)'' || ''erbettum'' || ''erbe'', ''erba'' || ''erb\u00fbm'' || Gender polarity || ''reb\u00fbm'' || ''reb\u016btum''\n|-\n| align='left' | 5 || ''\u1e2bam\u0161at'' || ''\u1e2bami\u0161tum'' || ''\u1e2bami\u0161'' || ''\u1e2bam\u0161um'' || Gender polarity || ''\u1e2bam\u0161um'' || ''\u1e2bamu\u0161tum''\n|-\n| align='left' | 6 || ''\u0161e\u0161\u0161et'' || ''\u0161edi\u0161tum'' || ''\u0161edi\u0161''?

(Modern [[South Semitic]] languages in [[Ethiopia]] also have SOV order, but these developed within historical times from the classical [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] (VSO) language [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]].) It has been hypothesized that this word order was a result of influence from the [[Sumerian language]], which was also SOV. There is evidence that native speakers of both languages were in intimate language contact, forming a single society for at least 500 years, so it is entirely likely that a [[sprachbund]] could have formed.{{sfn | Deutscher | 2000 | p=21}} Further evidence of an original VSO or SVO ordering can be found in the fact that direct and indirect object pronouns are suffixed to the verb.  Word order seems to have shifted to SVO/VSO late in the 1st millennium BC to the 1st millennium AD, possibly under the influence of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]].\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe Akkadian vocabulary is mostly of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] origin. Although classified as '[[East Semitic]]', many elements of its basic vocabulary find no evident parallels in related Semitic languages. For example: ''m\u0101ru'' 'son' (Semitic *bn), ''q\u0101tu'' 'hand' (Semitic *yd), ''\u0161\u0113pu'' 'foot' (Semitic *rgl), ''qab\u00fb'' 'say' (Semitic *qwl), ''izuzzu'' 'stand' (Semitic *qwm), ''ana'' 'to, for' (Semitic *li).\n\nDue to extensive contact with Sumerian and [[Aramaic]], the Akkadian vocabulary contains many loan words from these languages. Aramaic loan words, however, were limited to the 1st centuries of the 1st millennium BC and primarily in the north and middle parts of [[Mesopotamia]], whereas Sumerian loan words were spread in the whole linguistic area. Beside the previous languages, some nouns were borrowed from [[Hurrian]], [[Kassite language|Kassite]], [[Ugaritic]] and other ancient languages.\nSince Sumerian and Hurrian, two non-Semitic languages, differ from Akkadian in word structure, only nouns and some adjectives (not many verbs) were borrowed from these languages. However, some verbs were borrowed (along with many nouns) from Aramaic and Ugaritic, both of which are Semitic languages.\n\nThe following table contains examples of loan words in Akkadian:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Akkadian\n!Meaning\n!Source\n!Word in the language of origin\n|-\n| ''d\u00fb'' || hill || Sumerian || ''du''\n|-\n| ''er\u0113qu'' || flee || Aramaic || ''\u02bfRQ'' ([[Triliteral|root]])\n|-\n| ''gadal\u00fb'' || dressed in linen || Sumerian || ''gada l\u00e1''\n|-\n| ''isinnu'' || firmly || Sumerian || ''ezen''\n|-\n| ''kasulat\u1e2bu'' || a device of copper || Hurrian || ''kasulat\u1e2b-''\n|-\n| ''kisallu'' || court || Sumerian || ''kisal''\n|-\n| ''laq\u0101\u1e2bu'' || take || Ugaritic || ''LQ\u1e24''([[Triliteral|root]])\n|-\n| ''para\u0161\u0161annu'' || part of horse riding gear || Hurrian || ''para\u0161\u0161ann-''\n|-\n| ''purkullu'' || stone cutter || Sumerian || ''bur-gul''\n|-\n| ''qa\u1e6d\u0101lu'' || kill || Aramaic || ''Q\u1e6cL'' ([[Triliteral|root]])\n|-\n| ''uri\u1e2bullu'' || conventional penalty || Hurrian || ''uri\u1e2bull-''\n|-\n|}\nAkkadian was also a source of borrowing to other languages, above all [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. Some examples are: Sumerian ''da-ri'' ('lastingly', from Akkadian ''d\u0101ru''), Sumerian ''ra gaba'' ('riders, messenger', from Akkadian ''r\u0101kibu'').\n\n==Sample text==\nThe following is the 7th section of the [[Code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi law code]], written in the mid-18th century BC:\n\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| \u0161umma aw\u012bl-um l\u016b kasp-am l\u016b \u1e2bur\u0101\u1e63-am l\u016b ward-am l\u016b amt-am\n| if man-NOM or silver-ACC or gold-ACC or slave-M.ACC or slave-F.ACC\n|}}\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| l\u016b alp-am l\u016b immer-am l\u016b im\u0113r-am \u016b l\u016b {mimma \u0161um\u0161u} ina\n| or cattle/oxen-ACC or sheep-ACC or donkey-ACC and or something from\n|}}\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| q\u0101t m\u0101r aw\u012bl-im \u016b l\u016b warad aw\u012bl-im balum \u0161\u012bb-\u012b u\n| hand-{{gcl|CONST|Status Constructus|Construct state}} son-{{gcl|CONST|Status Constructus|Construct state}} man-GEN and or slave-{{gcl|CONST|Status Constructus|Construct state}} man-GEN without witnesses-GEN and\n|}}\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| riks-\u0101tim i-\u0161t\u0101m-\u00d8 \u016b l\u016b ana ma\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r\u016bt-im i-m\u1e2bur-\u00d8\n| contracts-GEN bought-3.SG.PERF and or for safekeeping-GEN received-3.SG.PRET\n|}}\n{{interlinear|lang=akk|glossing=link\n| aw\u012bl-um \u0161\u016b \u0161arr\u0101q i-dd\u0101k\n| man-NOM he-3.M.SG stealer-{{gcl|ABS|Status Absolutus|Absolute state}} is_killed-3.SG.PASS-PRS\n|}}\n\nTranslation:\n:''If a man has bought silver or gold, a male or a female slave,<br/>an ox, a sheep, or a donkey\u2014or anything for that matter\u2014<br/>from another man or from another man\u2019s slave without witnesses or contract,<br/>or if he accepted something for safekeeping without same,<br/>then this man is a thief and hence to be killed.''\n\n==Akkadian literature==\n{{Portal|Asia}}\n{{Main|Akkadian literature}}\n*[[Atrahasis Epic]] (early 2nd millennium BC)\n*[[En\u00fbma Elish]] (c. 18th century BC)\n*[[Amarna letters]] (14th century BC)\n*[[Epic of Gilgamesh]] ([[Sin-liqe-unninni]]', Standard Babylonian version, 13th to 11th century BC)\n*[[Ludlul b\u0113l n\u0113meqi|Ludlul Bel Nemeqi]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*Aro, Jussi (1957).
