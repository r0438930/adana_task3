The film, based on [[DC Comics]] characters, stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and provides a possible [[origin story]] for the character. Set in 1981, it follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian whose descent into insanity and nihilism inspires a violent counter-cultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying [[Gotham City]]. [[Robert De Niro]], [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Frances Conroy]], [[Brett Cullen]], [[Glenn Fleshler]], [[Bill Camp]], [[Shea Whigham]], and [[Marc Maron]] appear in supporting roles. ''Joker'' was produced by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]], [[DC Films]], and Joint Effort, in association with [[Bron Studios|Bron Creative]] and [[Village Roadshow Pictures]], and distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nPhillips conceived ''Joker'' in 2016 and wrote the script with Silver throughout 2017. The two were inspired by 1970s character studies and the films of [[Martin Scorsese]] (particularly ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]''), who was initially attached to the project as a producer. The graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' (1988) was the basis for the film's premise, but Phillips and Silver otherwise did not look to specific comics for inspiration. Phoenix became attached in February 2018 and was cast that July, while the majority of the cast signed on by August. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[New York City]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], from September to December 2018. ''Joker'' is the first live-action [[Batman in film|theatrical ''Batman'' film]] to receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R-rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], due to its violent and disturbing content.\n\n''Joker'' premiered at the [[76th Venice International Film Festival]] on August 31, 2019, where it won the [[Golden Lion]], and was released in the United States on October 4, 2019. The film polarized critics; while it was highly praised for Phoenix's performance, the musical score, cinematography and production values, it was met with mixed reception concerning Phillips' screenplay and direction. The film's dark tone, portrayal of mental illness, and handling of violence divided opinion and also generated concerns of inspiring real-world violence; the movie theater where the [[2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting|2012 Aurora, Colorado mass shooting]] occurred during a screening of ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' refused to show it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/03/why-joker-became-one-most-divisive-movies-year/|title=Why 'Joker' became one of the most divisive movies of the year|last=Cavna|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2019|website=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=October 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003213559/https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/03/why-joker-became-one-most-divisive-movies-year/|archive-date=October 3, 2019}}</ref> Despite this, ''Joker'' became a major box office success and set records for an October release. It grossed over $1 billion, making it the first [[List of highest-grossing R-rated films|R-rated film]] to do so, the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and the [[List of highest-grossing films|31st-highest-grossing film]] of all time.\n\n''Joker'' received [[List of accolades received by Joker (2019 film)|numerous accolades]]. At the [[92nd Academy Awards]], the film earned a leading 11 nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Phoenix and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for [[Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir]]. Phoenix and Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir also won at the [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] and [[BAFTA Award]] ceremonies.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should generally be no more than 700 words. The current summary is 624 words.-->\nIn 1981, [[Clown|party clown]] and aspiring [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] Arthur Fleck lives with his mother, Penny, in [[Gotham City]]. Frequently teased and made fun of, Arthur is despondent of Gotham's ambiance, which is rife with crime and unemployment, leaving swathes of the population disenfranchised and impoverished. Arthur suffers from <!-- DO NOT LINK TO PSUEDOBULBAR AFFECT, IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE FILM -->a medical disorder that causes him to laugh at uncomfortable and inappropriate times;<!-- DO NOT LINK TO PSUEDOBULBAR AFFECT, IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE FILM --> he depends on social services for medication. After a gang of delinquents attacks Arthur in an alley, his co-worker, Randall, gives him a gun for protection. Arthur meets his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to his upcoming stand-up routine at a nightclub.\n\nWhile entertaining at a children's hospital, Arthur's gun falls out of his pocket. Despite his claim that the gun is a prop for his shows, Randall states it's real and lies to management that Arthur bought the gun himself and Arthur is fired. On the subway, still in his clown makeup, Arthur is beaten by three drunken [[Wayne Enterprises]] businessmen; he shoots two in self-defense and executes the third. The killings are condemned by billionaire mayoral candidate [[Thomas Wayne]], who calls those envious of more successful people \"clowns.\" Demonstrations against Gotham's rich begin, with protesters donning clown masks in Arthur's image. Funding cuts shutter the social service program, leaving Arthur without his medication. All this results in Arthur having a mental breakdown, leading him to knock on Sophie's door and passionately kiss her, leading to a budding relationship.\n\nSophie attends Arthur's stand-up routine, which goes poorly; he laughs uncontrollably and has difficulty delivering his jokes. Popular talk show host Murray Franklin mocks Arthur by showing clips from the comedy routine on his show. Arthur intercepts a letter written by Penny to Thomas, alleging that he is Thomas's illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth. Arthur goes to [[Wayne Manor]], where he meets Thomas's young son [[Batman|Bruce]], but flees after a scuffle with the family butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. Following a visit from two [[Gotham City Police Department]] detectives investigating Arthur's involvement in the train murders, Penny suffers a stroke and is hospitalized.\n\nAt a public event, Arthur confronts Thomas, who tells him that Penny is delusional and not his biological mother. In denial, Arthur visits [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham State Hospital]] and steals Penny's case file; the file says Penny adopted Arthur as a baby and allowed her abusive boyfriend to harm them both. However, Penny says that Thomas used his influence to fabricate the adoption to hide their affair. Distraught, Arthur returns home and enters Sophie's apartment unannounced. Frightened, Sophie tells him to leave and their previous encounters are revealed to be Arthur's delusions. The following day, Arthur smothers Penny with a pillow at the hospital.\n\nArthur is invited to appear on Murray's show due to the unexpected popularity of his comedy routine's clips. As he prepares, Arthur is visited by Randall and fellow ex-colleague Gary. Arthur brutally murders Randall but leaves Gary unharmed as he treated him well in the past. En{{nbsp}}route to the studio, Arthur is pursued by the two detectives onto a train filled with some of the clown protesters. One detective accidentally shoots a protester and incites a riot, allowing Arthur to escape.\n\nBefore the show goes live, Arthur requests that Murray introduce him as [[Joker (character)|Joker]], a reference to Murray's previous mockery. Arthur walks out to applause, but starts telling morbid jokes, confesses to the train murders, and rants about how society abandons the downtrodden and [[Mental disorder|mentally ill]]. When Murray criticizes him, Arthur begins acting more erratically. To everyone's shock Arthur murders him and is arrested as riots break out across Gotham. <!--DO NOT LINK TO JOE CHILL, HE IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE MOVIE-->One rioter<!--DO NOT LINK TO JOE CHILL, HE IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE MOVIE--> corners the Wayne family in an alley and murders Thomas and his wife, [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], sparing Bruce.{{efn|Identified off-screen as the [[origin of Batman]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Russel |first1=Bradley |title=Joker ending explained: your biggest questions answered |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/joker-ending-explained/ |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |accessdate=October 5, 2019 |date=October 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191004233012/https://www.gamesradar.com/joker-ending-explained/ |archive-date=October 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>}} Rioters in an ambulance crash into the police car carrying Arthur, freeing him; he dances to the cheers of the crowd.\n\nAt Arkham, Arthur laughs to himself about a joke and tells his psychiatrist she would not understand it.

The film, based on [[DC Comics]] characters, stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and provides a possible [[origin story]] for the character. Set in 1981, it follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian whose descent into insanity and nihilism inspires a violent counter-cultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying [[Gotham City]]. [[Robert De Niro]], [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Frances Conroy]], [[Brett Cullen]], [[Glenn Fleshler]], [[Bill Camp]], [[Shea Whigham]], and [[Marc Maron]] appear in supporting roles. ''Joker'' was produced by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]], [[DC Films]], and Joint Effort, in association with [[Bron Studios|Bron Creative]] and [[Village Roadshow Pictures]], and distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nPhillips conceived ''Joker'' in 2016 and wrote the script with Silver throughout 2017. The two were inspired by 1970s character studies and the films of [[Martin Scorsese]] (particularly ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]''), who was initially attached to the project as a producer. The graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' (1988) was the basis for the film's premise, but Phillips and Silver otherwise did not look to specific comics for inspiration. Phoenix became attached in February 2018 and was cast that July, while the majority of the cast signed on by August. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[New York City]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], from September to December 2018. ''Joker'' is the first live-action [[Batman in film|theatrical ''Batman'' film]] to receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R-rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], due to its violent and disturbing content.\n\n''Joker'' premiered at the [[76th Venice International Film Festival]] on August 31, 2019, where it won the [[Golden Lion]], and was released in the United States on October 4, 2019. The film polarized critics; while it was highly praised for Phoenix's performance, the musical score, cinematography and production values, it was met with mixed reception concerning Phillips' screenplay and direction. The film's dark tone, portrayal of mental illness, and handling of violence divided opinion and also generated concerns of inspiring real-world violence; the movie theater where the [[2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting|2012 Aurora, Colorado mass shooting]] occurred during a screening of ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' refused to show it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/03/why-joker-became-one-most-divisive-movies-year/|title=Why 'Joker' became one of the most divisive movies of the year|last=Cavna|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2019|website=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=October 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003213559/https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/03/why-joker-became-one-most-divisive-movies-year/|archive-date=October 3, 2019}}</ref> Despite this, ''Joker'' became a major box office success, setting records for an October release. It has grossed over $1 billion, making it the first [[List of highest-grossing R-rated films|R-rated film]] to do so, the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and the [[List of highest-grossing films|31st-highest-grossing film]] of all time.\n\n''Joker'' received [[List of accolades received by Joker (2019 film)|numerous accolades]]. At the [[92nd Academy Awards]], the film earned a leading 11 nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Phoenix and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for [[Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir]]. Phoenix and Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir also won at the [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] and [[BAFTA Award]] ceremonies.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should generally be no more than 700 words. The current summary is 624 words.-->\nIn 1981, [[Clown|party clown]] and aspiring [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] Arthur Fleck lives with his mother, Penny, in [[Gotham City]]. Frequently teased and made fun of, Arthur is despondent of Gotham's ambiance, which is rife with crime and unemployment, leaving swathes of the population disenfranchised and impoverished. Arthur suffers from <!-- DO NOT LINK TO PSUEDOBULBAR AFFECT, IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE FILM -->a medical disorder that causes him to laugh at uncomfortable and inappropriate times;<!-- DO NOT LINK TO PSUEDOBULBAR AFFECT, IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE FILM --> he depends on social services for medication. After a gang of delinquents attacks Arthur in an alley, his co-worker, Randall, gives him a gun for protection. Arthur meets his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to his upcoming stand-up routine at a nightclub.\n\nWhile entertaining at a children's hospital, Arthur's gun falls out of his pocket. Despite his claim that the gun is a prop for his shows, Randall states it's real and lies to management that Arthur bought the gun himself and Arthur is fired. On the subway, still in his clown makeup, Arthur is beaten by three drunken [[Wayne Enterprises]] businessmen; he shoots two in self-defense and executes the third. The killings are condemned by billionaire mayoral candidate [[Thomas Wayne]], who calls those envious of more successful people \"clowns.\" Demonstrations against Gotham's rich begin, with protesters donning clown masks in Arthur's image. Funding cuts shutter the social service program, leaving Arthur without his medication. All this results in Arthur having a mental breakdown, leading him to knock on Sophie's door and passionately kiss her, leading to a budding relationship.\n\nSophie attends Arthur's stand-up routine, which goes poorly; he laughs uncontrollably and has difficulty delivering his jokes. Popular talk show host Murray Franklin mocks Arthur by showing clips from the comedy routine on his show. Arthur intercepts a letter written by Penny to Thomas, alleging that he is Thomas's illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth. Arthur goes to [[Wayne Manor]], where he meets Thomas's young son [[Batman|Bruce]], but flees after a scuffle with the family butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. Following a visit from two [[Gotham City Police Department]] detectives investigating Arthur's involvement in the train murders, Penny suffers a stroke and is hospitalized.\n\nAt a public event, Arthur confronts Thomas, who tells him that Penny is delusional and not his biological mother. In denial, Arthur visits [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham State Hospital]] and steals Penny's case file; the file says Penny adopted Arthur as a baby and allowed her abusive boyfriend to harm them both. However, Penny says that Thomas used his influence to fabricate the adoption to hide their affair. Distraught, Arthur returns home and enters Sophie's apartment unannounced. Frightened, Sophie tells him to leave and their previous encounters are revealed to be Arthur's delusions. The following day, Arthur smothers Penny with a pillow at the hospital.\n\nArthur is invited to appear on Murray's show due to the unexpected popularity of his comedy routine's clips. As he prepares, Arthur is visited by Randall and fellow ex-colleague Gary. Arthur brutally murders Randall but leaves Gary unharmed as he treated him well in the past. En{{nbsp}}route to the studio, Arthur is pursued by the two detectives onto a train filled with some of the clown protesters. One detective accidentally shoots a protester and incites a riot, allowing Arthur to escape.\n\nBefore the show goes live, Arthur requests that Murray introduce him as [[Joker (character)|Joker]], a reference to Murray's previous mockery.
