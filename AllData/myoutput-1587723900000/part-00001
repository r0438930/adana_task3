Although spurred to life by events in [[Soviet Russia]] in the aftermath of [[World War I]], the party had roots in pre-existing [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] and [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] organisations, including in particular the independent [[Wellington]] Socialist Party, supporters of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] in the Auckland region, and a network of [[impossiblism|impossiblist]] study groups of miners on the west coast of the South Island.\n\nNever high on the list of priorities of the [[Communist International]], the CPNZ was considered an appendage of the [[Communist Party of Australia]] until 1928, when it began to function as a fully independent national party. Party membership remained small, only briefly topping the 1,000 mark, with its members subjected to government repression and isolated by expulsions from the mainstream labour movement concentrated in the [[New Zealand Labour Party]].\n\nDuring the period of the [[Sino-Soviet split]] of the 1960s, the CPNZ sided with the Chinese government headed by [[Mao Tse-tung]]. The party splintered into a multiplicity of tiny political parties after 1966 and no longer exists as an independent group.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nAs the 20th Century dawned, New Zealand was recognised by adherents of International Socialism around the globe as a sort of laboratory test case of [[social democracy|social democratic government]] in practice. One June 1901 pamphlet put to print by [[Julius Wayland|J.A. Wayland]], proprietor of the mass circulation socialist weekly ''[[Appeal to Reason (newspaper)|Appeal to Reason]],'' detailed the ways in which the island nation of 720,000 had already passed extensive legislation for the benefit of wage workers, backed by 200 agents of the \"Labour Intelligence Department.\"<ref name=Nutshell5-6>''New Zealand in a Nutshell.'' Wayland's Monthly No. 14. Girard, KS: J.A. Wayland, June 1901; pp. 5\u20136.</ref> While the country was declared \"no Utopia,\" New Zealand nevertheless was said to have \"no real want\" and \"no unemployment problem to solve.\"<ref name=Nutshell5-6 /> Instead trade unions were not merely formally recognised but were pervasive and had managed to mitigate the [[class struggle]] through [[arbitration]] laws sanctioned by law, with disputes decided by three member courts of arbitration, each including representatives of capital, labour, and the courts as provided in the 1894 [[Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act]].<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' pp. 7, 21.</ref>\n\nAn extensive system of public works were in existence, governed by the principle of \"fair work and fair pay.\"<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' p. 7.</ref> More than 200 employment bureaus dotted the country, connecting every willing worker with a job.<ref name=Nutshell8>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' pg. 8.</ref> [[Sweatshop]]s were banned, as was systematic home manufacturing, with mandatory labelling of all products made outside of factories.<ref name=Nutshell8 /> Wages were generally high and the 48-hour week said to be a local maximum.<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' p. 9.</ref> The presence of \"tramps\" had been eliminated through town allotments of small homesteads to poor workers, granted through easily affordable perpetual leases.<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' pp. 10\u201311.</ref> The power of [[eminent domain]] had been assumed by the [[New Zealand parliament]] in 1896, allowing the state to assume ownership of large estates at their assessed price for division into small farms.<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' p. 11.</ref>\n\nState finance had been accomplished by a [[property tax|tax on land values]] and the establishment of a progressive [[income tax]].<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' pp. 12\u201313.</ref> The national government itself owned and operated the railways, telegraph and telephone systems, schools, and [[postal savings bank]]s throughout the country even before the landmark election of 1891.<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' pp. 15\u201317, 34.</ref> Workers' compensation insurance to protect against injury was required by law, and low cost [[life insurance]] had been provided by the state since 1869. Old age pensions were provided to all New Zealanders 65 years of age or older who had been resident in the country for at least 25 years.<ref name=\"Nutshell, pg. 19\">''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' p. 19.</ref>\n\n\"The New Zealanders are collectivists, although they adhere to the old party names of liberals and tories,\" the American examiners enthused, with the [[New Zealand Liberal Party]] reckoned as equivalent to the [[Fabian Society|Fabian socialists]] of Great Britain.<ref name=\"Nutshell, pg. 19\"/> [[Richard Seddon]] (1845\u20131906), Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1893 until his death in 1906, oversaw implementation of an array of social welfare programs as leader of the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal Government]]\n\nThis idyllic vision \u2013 which incidentally paid no attention to the treatment of or conditions endured by the [[M\u0101ori people|indigenous Polynesian population]] \u2013 proved to be short-lived. With the eruption of [[World War I]] in 1914, [[Military history of New Zealand in World War I|New Zealand sent soldiers to Allied campaigns in Turkey, Palestine, and France and Flanders]]. Over 120,000 New Zealanders were enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, with about 100,000 men and women eventually serving as soldiers and nurses in Europe, out of a population of 1.14&nbsp;million.<ref name=MC1>[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/first-world-war-overview/introduction \"First World War \u2013 Overview,\"] History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage, p. 1.</ref> Of these, about 18,000 were killed in battle and another 41,000 felled by wounds or disease \u2013 a casualty rate approaching 60%.<ref name=MC1 /> [[Conscription]] was introduced in 1916, with the stream of volunteer enthusiasts exhausted.<ref name=MC5>\"First World War \u2013 Overview,\" p. 5.</ref> As casualties continued to mount into 1917, public war-weariness set in, fuelling political discontent.<ref name=MC5 /> A [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] movement began to emerge.\n\n===Establishment===\n[[File:Soviets-At-Worl.jpg|thumb|right|180px|West Coast American edition of Lenin's ''The Soviets at Work'' (1919) was an influential political tract among NZ revolutionary socialist activists.]]\n\nThere were isolated reflections of international radical tendencies present in New Zealand from shortly after the turn of the 20th Century. The [[New Zealand Socialist Party]] (NZSP), founded in 1901, included in its ranks a left wing which eschewed political action, arguing that socialism could only be won by the direct efforts of the organised working class acting through their unions.<ref name=Motto162>Kerry Taylor, \"'Our Motto, No Compromise': The Ideological Origins and Foundation of the Communist Party of New Zealand,\" ''New Zealand Journal of History,'' vol. 28, no. 2 (October 1994), p. 162.</ref>\n\nOthers adhered to the theories of [[Daniel DeLeon]], which advocated the use of the ballot box for a revolutionary transformation of society leading to a socialist state governed by revolutionary industrial unions.<ref name=Motto162-163>Taylor, \"'Our Motto, No Compromise,'\" pp. 162\u2013163.</ref> From 1911 the ideas of [[syndicalism]] began to gain a foothold in the [[Auckland]] area under the banner of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], while the anti-political [[impossibilism|impossibilist]] ideas of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] made their mark upon others.<ref name=Motto162-163 /> All of these tendencies would contribute adherents to the pioneer New Zealand communist movement.\n\nParticularly worthy of note were a small network of [[Marxist]] study circles were formed during the wartime years, concentrated mainly in the small mining communities of the [[South Island]].<ref name=Roth337>[[Bert Roth]], \"New Zealand,\" in Witold S. Sworakowski (ed.), ''World Communism: A Handbook, 1918\u20131965.'' Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1973; p. 337.</ref> Wartime violence and the [[October Revolution|October 1917 Revolution]] in Russia proved a stimulant to revolutionary ideas, drawing members to these groups, leading to their formal affiliation during the summer Christmas holiday of 1918 as the [[New Zealand Marxist Association]] (NZMA).<ref name=Roth337 /> This group electing [[T. W. Feary]] as secretary of the organisation and in 1919 dispatched him and two others to North America to gain additional information on the revolutionary movement through the American and Canadian prism.<ref name=Roth337 />\n\nVisiting the Pacific Coast cities of San Francisco and [[Vancouver]], Feary and his co-thinkers obtained copies of a number of influential publications, including ''[[Ten Days That Shook the World]],'' a participant's account of the October Revolution by [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], and ''The Soviets at Work,'' a widely reprinted pamphlet by [[V. I. Lenin|Lenin]].<ref name=Roth337 /> These were successfully smuggled back to New Zealand, with the Lenin tract immediately put into print in yet another new edition.<ref name=Roth337 />\n\nAdding to the complexity of the fragmented radical movement was the Wellington Socialist Party, formerly a branch of the NZSP which had split with the national organisation in 1913 over the issue of electoral politics. While the main body of the NZSP had gone on to found the [[New Zealand Labour Party]] in 1916, the Wellington Socialist Party believed in [[direct action]] and use of the [[general strike]] for the intended overthrow of capitalism and had forced a split.<ref name=Motto168>Taylor, \"'Our Motto, No Compromise,'\" p. 168.</ref> Suffering attenuation but surviving the war, this Wellington organisation would constitute the main component of the new Communist Party of New Zealand.<ref name=Motto168 />\n\nBy 1921 sentiment had begun to build for the establishment of a communist political party along those lines advocated by the fledgling [[Communist International]]. A preparatory conference was called for Easter weekend, 26\u201327 March 1921, in [[Wellington]].<ref name=Roth337 /> This preliminary gathering was followed with a formal organisational conference held on Saturday, 9 April, at Wellington Socialist Hall \u2013 headquarters of the Wellington Socialist Party \u2013 at which time the Communist Party of New Zealand (CPNZ) was formally established.<ref name=Motto170-171>Taylor, \"'Our Motto, No Compromise,'\" pp. 170\u2013171.</ref>\n\nOf the origins of the Communist Party, historian Kerry Taylor writes:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The foundation of the CPNZ will always remain shrouded in a degree of mystery. No direct record of the event survives \u2014 the minutes have long since been lost and no reports appeared in the media at the time.... The precise nature of the discussion and debate is obscure but the delegates had before them the constitution of the Communist Party of Australia and a draft manifesto and constitution drawn up over the previous few months by members of the Wellington Socialist Party.\"<ref name=Motto170-171 /></blockquote>\n\n[[E.

While in many countries this meant directives to immediately shatter joint work with social democratic political and trade union leaders, the Comintern's \"Resolution on the Tasks of the Communist Party of New Zealand,\" brought back to Wellington by Griffin, maintained that New Zealand was still marked by \"the steady upward swing of capitalist development, combined with relatively good conditions for the workers,\" thereby serving to \"prevent the possibility of a general revolutionary situation in New Zealand.\"<ref name=1928Res>\"Resolution on the Tasks of the Communist Party of New Zealand,\" RGASPI fond 495, opis 20, delo 430; quoted in Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 274.</ref> Instead of consolidating itself for an envisioned revolutionary uprising, the CPNZ was directed to concentrate its attention on continued agitation and propaganda.<ref name=1928Res />\n\nDick Griffin became the first full-time organiser of the CPNZ in May 1929.<ref name=Third277>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 277.</ref> In August of that same year he assumed the role of General Secretary of the organisation.<ref name=Third277 />\n\nIt was only in March 1930 that the CPNZ received a communication from ECCI directing it to take on ultra-radical policies in accord the Third Period analysis.<ref name=Third274>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 274.</ref> The party's previous policies were deemed incorrect and the CPNZ was instructed to attempt to assume leadership of the New Zealand workers movement by working to \"expose and destroy all the Labourite, [[pacifism|pacifist]], social democratic illusions about the possibility of solving social problems...under the existing political and economic regime.\"<ref>Letter from the Political Secretariat of ECCI to CPNZ, 4 March 1930, RGASPI f. 495, op. 20 d. 430; quoted in Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 274.</ref> This marked the actual beginning of [[sectarianism|sectarian]] Third Period tactics in New Zealand.\n\nThe CPNZ was beset by rapid membership turnover throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s, with general secretary Griffin accused of operating a personal dictatorship, spurring rank-and-file discontent.<ref name=Third278>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 278.</ref> The CPNZ was also subjected to unrelenting police operations by the national government, including a July 1929 raid which seized the internal records and literature of the Wellington branch and the subsequent successful prosecution of five members of the governing Central Executive Committee for possession and sale of allegedly seditious literature.<ref name=Third278 /> Party leaders were particularly targeted, with three more members of the Central Executive Committee arrested in 1930, four more in 1931 and 1932, and all seven members in 1933.<ref name=Third279>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 279.</ref>\n\nThe party was further disorganised by the churn of its rank-and-file members in and out of the party, exemplified by the count of Wellington members booming from 51 in March to 80 by May 1931 before plummeting to just 25 in January 1932.<ref name=Third278 /> Things grew so bad that by October 1932 only one member of the Central Executive Committee had been a member of the party for longer than a year, with some members for as little as two months.<ref name=Third278 /> The party was impoverished, its coffers drained both by the cost of producing the ''Red Worker'' (rival publication to the mainstream trade unionist ''Maoriland Worker),'' and by courtroom losses in several [[libel]] cases brought against that publication.<ref name=Third278 /> Party publications were carefully scrutinised, with two issues of the ''Red Worker'' and a pamphlet found to be seditious in 1932 and those responsible for their publication jailed for more than a year.<ref name=Third279 />\n\nThe CPNZ also lost its influence in the country's trade unions during the late 1920s and early 1930s owing to its rigid support for unpopular [[secondary strike]]s in solidarity with workers in other countries. This was epitomised by a 1929 call for a miners' strike in sympathy with mine and timber workers in Australia, which annihilated party influence among the miners of the South Island's West Coast and 1931 efforts to blackball a Japanese ship, which led to discord and alienation from the party in the Seamen's Union.<ref name=Third282>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 282.</ref>\n\n===\"Freemanisation\"===\n\nBy the middle of 1933, the Communist Party of New Zealand was in crisis, with its entire Central Committee jailed for publication of the pamphlet ''Karl Marx and the Struggle of the Masses.''<ref name=Third288>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" pg. 288.</ref> The New Zealand-born [[Fred Freeman]] was returned to the country to assume the position of general secretary following four years in Moscow at the service of the Comintern.<ref name=Third288 /> More politically astute and organisationally adroit than Griffin, Freeman promoted university graduates [[Clement Gordon Watson]] and his future wife, Elsie Farrelly, to positions of party leadership, where they were joined by party veteran Ernie Brooks.<ref name=Third288 /> This group of four would dominate CPNZ politics through the end of 1935.<ref name=Third288 />\n\nThe operations of the CPNZ came to resemble those of larger and more efficient communist parties in other countries, with official directives and circulars issued systematically for the first time by the Central Committee to local party committees.<ref name=Third288 /> Representatives of the Central Committee also began to travel regularly to visit local party organisations.<ref name=Third288 /> Dues collecting and record-keeping of branches was made more regular and increased attention was paid to the problem of internal security in an effort to stave the crippling series of arrests that had swept the party.<ref>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" pp. 288\u2013289.</ref>\n\nComintern policy began to change in 1933 following the victory of the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany, leading to eventual advocacy of a so-called [[Popular Front]] against fascism by 1935. Under the Freeman leadership the CPNZ took the first tentative steps in this direction late in 1933 when the CPNZ approached the National Executive Committee of the [[New Zealand Labour Party]] with a proposal for a joint campaign against fascism.<ref name=Third289>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 289.</ref> No answer was given.

Tensions worsened in 1940, when the [[Battle of Britain|Great Britain came under attack]] \u2013 a country to which New Zealanders felt a particular national affinity.

The party was divided between supporters of the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and those who claimed Khrushchev was a \"revisionist\" and chose instead to follow China under [[Mao Zedong]]. Subsequently, the CPNZ under the leadership of [[Victor Wilcox]] became the first official Communist party in the First World to side with Mao. The majority of the party and its newspaper ''The People's Voice'' adopted Maoism, while supporters of Khrushchev's [[Soviet Union]] (mainly Auckland trade unionists) split off to form the [[Socialist Unity Party (New Zealand)|Socialist Unity Party]].{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=29}} The Communist Party also maintained warm ties with the [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Indonesian Communist Party]] and supported Indonesia during the [[Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation]] (1963&ndash;1966). It also condemned the [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u201366|Indonesian mass killings]] that followed the alleged [[30 September Movement|30 September coup attempt]] as a right wing coup.{{sfn|Lim|2016|pp=49-53}}\n\nLater, when Mao died, the Communist Party of New Zealand began to follow the lead of [[Enver Hoxha]]'s [[Albania]], which they considered to be the last truly Communist country in the world. Members of the CPNZ national leadership who continued to uphold the line of the post-Mao [[Chinese Communist Party]] including Wilcox were expelled, and formed the [[Organisation for Marxist Unity \u2013 New Zealand|Preparatory Committee for the Formation of the Communist Party of New Zealand (Marxist\u2013Leninist)]].{{sfn|Alexander|2001|p=198}} \n\nMeanwhile, other former members of the CPNZ in Wellington, where the party branch had been expelled ''en masse'' in 1970, founded the Wellington Marxist Leninist Organisation, which in 1980 merged with the Northern Communist Organisation to form the [[Workers' Communist League (New Zealand)|Workers' Communist League]] (WCL).{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=29}}\n\nWhile the CPNZ never had mass influence or real political power, it pursued a Leninist vanguard party approach that involved trying to [[entryism|influence and penetrate]] the Labour Party, the  New Zealand trade union movement, various single-issue protest groups and public opinion on foreign policy, industrial activity, opposition to New Zealand's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], [[M\u0101ori protest movement|M\u0101ori rights]], the anti-[[Apartheid]] movement, feminism, and [[nuclear disarmament]], and anti-colonial activism in the Pacific region; issues in which communists and non-communist left-wing elements found common cause.{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|pp=29-30}}\n\n===Decline and legacy===\nAfter the collapse of Communism in Albania, the Communist Party of New Zealand gradually changed its views, renouncing its former support of [[Stalinism]], [[Maoism]], and [[Enver Hoxha|Hoxhaism]]. Instead, under the leadership of its last general secretary, [[Grant Morgan]], it developed a [[State Capitalist]] analysis of the Stalinist states. The party now believed that the Soviet Union had never been socialist at all, not even in Stalin's time. Opponents of this change departed and established the [[Communist Party of Aotearoa]] (a Maoist group) and the Marxist\u2013Leninist Collective (a pro-Hoxha group). The Communist Party of New Zealand eventually merged with the neo-Trotskyist [[International Socialist Organization (New Zealand)|International Socialist Organization]] in 1994. The resultant party, known as the [[Socialist Workers Organization (New Zealand)|Socialist Workers Organization]], evolved into the small but highly active [[Socialist Worker (Aotearoa)]]. However, most of the ISO members split off again and resumed their own organisation. SW voted to dissolve itself at its conference in January 2012.   A number of SW members split from the organisation in 2008 to form [[Socialist Aotearoa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fightback.org.nz/resources/open-letter-to-socialist-aotearoa-may-2008/|title=Open Letter to Socialist Aotearoa (May 2008)|date=2008-05-05|website=FightBack|language=en|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 the [[New Communist Party of Aotearoa]] was founded, with its first [[Party conference|party congress]] held in Wellington on 21 and 22 November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newcommunist.party/congress/|title=Announcing our First National Congress \u2013 New Communist Party of Aotearoa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newcommunist.party/1nc/|title=First National Congress of the NCPA \u2013 New Communist Party of Aotearoa|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref>\n\n== Membership ==\n{{Communist parties}}\n::{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"3\"\n|-\n!

Although spurred to life by events in [[Soviet Russia]] in the aftermath of [[World War I]], the party had roots in pre-existing [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] and [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] organisations, including in particular the independent [[Wellington]] Socialist Party, supporters of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] in the Auckland region, and a network of [[impossiblism|impossiblist]] study groups of miners on the west coast of the South Island.\n\nNever high on the list of priorities of the [[Communist International]], the CPNZ was considered an appendage of the [[Communist Party of Australia]] until 1928, when it began to function as a fully independent national party. Party membership remained small, only briefly topping the 1,000 mark, with its members subjected to government repression and isolated by expulsions from the mainstream labour movement concentrated in the [[New Zealand Labour Party]].\n\nDuring the period of the [[Sino-Soviet split]] of the 1960s, the CPNZ sided with the Chinese government headed by [[Mao Tse-tung]]. The party splintered into a multiplicity of tiny political parties after 1966 and no longer exists as an independent group.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nAs the 20th Century dawned, New Zealand was recognised by adherents of International Socialism around the globe as a sort of laboratory test case of [[social democracy|social democratic government]] in practice. One June 1901 pamphlet put to print by [[Julius Wayland|J.A. Wayland]], proprietor of the mass circulation socialist weekly ''[[Appeal to Reason (newspaper)|Appeal to Reason]],'' detailed the ways in which the island nation of 720,000 had already passed extensive legislation for the benefit of wage workers, backed by 200 agents of the \"Labour Intelligence Department.\"<ref name=Nutshell5-6>''New Zealand in a Nutshell.'' Wayland's Monthly No. 14. Girard, KS: J.A. Wayland, June 1901; pp. 5\u20136.</ref> While the country was declared \"no Utopia,\" New Zealand nevertheless was said to have \"no real want\" and \"no unemployment problem to solve.\"<ref name=Nutshell5-6 /> Instead trade unions were not merely formally recognised but were pervasive and had managed to mitigate the [[class struggle]] through [[arbitration]] laws sanctioned by law, with disputes decided by three member courts of arbitration, each including representatives of capital, labour, and the courts as provided in the 1894 [[Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act]].<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' pp. 7, 21.</ref>\n\nAn extensive system of public works were in existence, governed by the principle of \"fair work and fair pay.\"<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' p. 7.</ref> More than 200 employment bureaus dotted the country, connecting every willing worker with a job.<ref name=Nutshell8>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' pg. 8.</ref> [[Sweatshop]]s were banned, as was systematic home manufacturing, with mandatory labelling of all products made outside of factories.<ref name=Nutshell8 /> Wages were generally high and the 48-hour week said to be a local maximum.<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' p. 9.</ref> The presence of \"tramps\" had been eliminated through town allotments of small homesteads to poor workers, granted through easily affordable perpetual leases.<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' pp. 10\u201311.</ref> The power of [[eminent domain]] had been assumed by the [[New Zealand parliament]] in 1896, allowing the state to assume ownership of large estates at their assessed price for division into small farms.<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' p. 11.</ref>\n\nState finance had been accomplished by a [[property tax|tax on land values]] and the establishment of a progressive [[income tax]].<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' pp. 12\u201313.</ref> The national government itself owned and operated the railways, telegraph and telephone systems, schools, and [[postal savings bank]]s throughout the country even before the landmark election of 1891.<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' pp. 15\u201317, 34.</ref> Workers' compensation insurance to protect against injury was required by law, and low cost [[life insurance]] had been provided by the state since 1869. Old age pensions were provided to all New Zealanders 65 years of age or older who had been resident in the country for at least 25 years.<ref name=\"Nutshell, pg. 19\">''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' p. 19.</ref>\n\n\"The New Zealanders are collectivists, although they adhere to the old party names of liberals and tories,\" the American examiners enthused, with the [[New Zealand Liberal Party]] reckoned as equivalent to the [[Fabian Society|Fabian socialists]] of Great Britain.<ref name=\"Nutshell, pg. 19\"/> [[Richard Seddon]] (1845\u20131906), Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1893 until his death in 1906, oversaw implementation of an array of social welfare programs as leader of the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal Government]]\n\nThis idyllic vision \u2013 which incidentally paid no attention to the treatment of or conditions endured by the [[M\u0101ori people|indigenous Polynesian population]] \u2013 proved to be short-lived. With the eruption of [[World War I]] in 1914, [[Military history of New Zealand in World War I|New Zealand sent soldiers to Allied campaigns in Turkey, Palestine, and France and Flanders]]. Over 120,000 New Zealanders were enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, with about 100,000 men and women eventually serving as soldiers and nurses in Europe, out of a population of 1.14&nbsp;million.<ref name=MC1>[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/first-world-war-overview/introduction \"First World War \u2013 Overview,\"] History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage, p. 1.</ref> Of these, about 18,000 were killed in battle and another 41,000 felled by wounds or disease \u2013 a casualty rate approaching 60%.<ref name=MC1 /> [[Conscription]] was introduced in 1916, with the stream of volunteer enthusiasts exhausted.<ref name=MC5>\"First World War \u2013 Overview,\" p. 5.</ref> As casualties continued to mount into 1917, public war-weariness set in, fuelling political discontent.<ref name=MC5 /> A [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] movement began to emerge.\n\n===Establishment===\n[[File:Soviets-At-Worl.jpg|thumb|right|180px|West Coast American edition of Lenin's ''The Soviets at Work'' (1919) was an influential political tract among NZ revolutionary socialist activists.]]\n\nThere were isolated reflections of international radical tendencies present in New Zealand from shortly after the turn of the 20th Century. The [[New Zealand Socialist Party]] (NZSP), founded in 1901, included in its ranks a left wing which eschewed political action, arguing that socialism could only be won by the direct efforts of the organised working class acting through their unions.<ref name=Motto162>Kerry Taylor, \"'Our Motto, No Compromise': The Ideological Origins and Foundation of the Communist Party of New Zealand,\" ''New Zealand Journal of History,'' vol. 28, no. 2 (October 1994), p. 162.</ref>\n\nOthers adhered to the theories of [[Daniel DeLeon]], which advocated the use of the ballot box for a revolutionary transformation of society leading to a socialist state governed by revolutionary industrial unions.<ref name=Motto162-163>Taylor, \"'Our Motto, No Compromise,'\" pp. 162\u2013163.</ref> From 1911 the ideas of [[syndicalism]] began to gain a foothold in the [[Auckland]] area under the banner of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], while the anti-political [[impossibilism|impossibilist]] ideas of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] made their mark upon others.<ref name=Motto162-163 /> All of these tendencies would contribute adherents to the pioneer New Zealand communist movement.\n\nParticularly worthy of note were a small network of [[Marxist]] study circles were formed during the wartime years, concentrated mainly in the small mining communities of the [[South Island]].<ref name=Roth337>[[Bert Roth]], \"New Zealand,\" in Witold S. Sworakowski (ed.), ''World Communism: A Handbook, 1918\u20131965.'' Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1973; p. 337.</ref> Wartime violence and the [[October Revolution|October 1917 Revolution]] in Russia proved a stimulant to revolutionary ideas, drawing members to these groups, leading to their formal affiliation during the summer Christmas holiday of 1918 as the [[New Zealand Marxist Association]] (NZMA).<ref name=Roth337 /> This group electing [[T. W. Feary]] as secretary of the organisation and in 1919 dispatched him and two others to North America to gain additional information on the revolutionary movement through the American and Canadian prism.<ref name=Roth337 />\n\nVisiting the Pacific Coast cities of San Francisco and [[Vancouver]], Feary and his co-thinkers obtained copies of a number of influential publications, including ''[[Ten Days That Shook the World]],'' a participant's account of the October Revolution by [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], and ''The Soviets at Work,'' a widely reprinted pamphlet by [[V. I.

While in many countries this meant directives to immediately shatter joint work with social democratic political and trade union leaders, the Comintern's \"Resolution on the Tasks of the Communist Party of New Zealand,\" brought back to Wellington by Griffin, maintained that New Zealand was still marked by \"the steady upward swing of capitalist development, combined with relatively good conditions for the workers,\" thereby serving to \"prevent the possibility of a general revolutionary situation in New Zealand.\"<ref name=1928Res>\"Resolution on the Tasks of the Communist Party of New Zealand,\" RGASPI fond 495, opis 20, delo 430; quoted in Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 274.</ref> Instead of consolidating itself for an envisioned revolutionary uprising, the CPNZ was directed to concentrate its attention on continued agitation and propaganda.<ref name=1928Res />\n\nDick Griffin became the first full-time organiser of the CPNZ in May 1929.<ref name=Third277>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 277.</ref> In August of that same year he assumed the role of General Secretary of the organisation.<ref name=Third277 />\n\nIt was only in March 1930 that the CPNZ received a communication from ECCI directing it to take on ultra-radical policies in accord the Third Period analysis.<ref name=Third274>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 274.</ref> The party's previous policies were deemed incorrect and the CPNZ was instructed to attempt to assume leadership of the New Zealand workers movement by working to \"expose and destroy all the Labourite, [[pacifism|pacifist]], social democratic illusions about the possibility of solving social problems...under the existing political and economic regime.\"<ref>Letter from the Political Secretariat of ECCI to CPNZ, 4 March 1930, RGASPI f. 495, op. 20 d. 430; quoted in Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 274.</ref> This marked the actual beginning of [[sectarianism|sectarian]] Third Period tactics in New Zealand.\n\nThe CPNZ was beset by rapid membership turnover throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s, with general secretary Griffin accused of operating a personal dictatorship, spurring rank-and-file discontent.<ref name=Third278>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 278.</ref> The CPNZ was also subjected to unrelenting police operations by the national government, including a July 1929 raid which seized the internal records and literature of the Wellington branch and the subsequent successful prosecution of five members of the governing Central Executive Committee for possession and sale of allegedly seditious literature.<ref name=Third278 /> Party leaders were particularly targeted, with three more members of the Central Executive Committee arrested in 1930, four more in 1931 and 1932, and all seven members in 1933.<ref name=Third279>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 279.</ref>\n\nThe party was further disorganised by the churn of its rank-and-file members in and out of the party, exemplified by the count of Wellington members booming from 51 in March to 80 by May 1931 before plummeting to just 25 in January 1932.<ref name=Third278 /> Things grew so bad that by October 1932 only one member of the Central Executive Committee had been a member of the party for longer than a year, with some members for as little as two months.<ref name=Third278 /> The party was impoverished, its coffers drained both by the cost of producing the ''Red Worker'' (rival publication to the mainstream trade unionist ''Maoriland Worker),'' and by courtroom losses in several [[libel]] cases brought against that publication.<ref name=Third278 /> Party publications were carefully scrutinised, with two issues of the ''Red Worker'' and a pamphlet found to be seditious in 1932 and those responsible for their publication jailed for more than a year.<ref name=Third279 />\n\nThe CPNZ also lost its influence in the country's trade unions during the late 1920s and early 1930s owing to its rigid support for unpopular [[secondary strike]]s in solidarity with workers in other countries. This was epitomised by a 1929 call for a miners' strike in sympathy with mine and timber workers in Australia, which annihilated party influence among the miners of the South Island's West Coast and 1931 efforts to blackball a Japanese ship, which led to discord and alienation from the party in the Seamen's Union.<ref name=Third282>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 282.</ref>\n\n===\"Freemanisation\"===\n\nBy the middle of 1933, the Communist Party of New Zealand was in crisis, with its entire Central Committee jailed for publication of the pamphlet ''Karl Marx and the Struggle of the Masses.''<ref name=Third288>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" pg. 288.</ref> The New Zealand-born [[Fred Freeman]] was returned to the country to assume the position of general secretary following four years in Moscow at the service of the Comintern.<ref name=Third288 /> More politically astute and organisationally adroit than Griffin, Freeman promoted university graduates [[Clement Gordon Watson]] and his future wife, Elsie Farrelly, to positions of party leadership, where they were joined by party veteran Ernie Brooks.<ref name=Third288 /> This group of four would dominate CPNZ politics through the end of 1935.<ref name=Third288 />\n\nThe operations of the CPNZ came to resemble those of larger and more efficient communist parties in other countries, with official directives and circulars issued systematically for the first time by the Central Committee to local party committees.<ref name=Third288 /> Representatives of the Central Committee also began to travel regularly to visit local party organisations.<ref name=Third288 /> Dues collecting and record-keeping of branches was made more regular and increased attention was paid to the problem of internal security in an effort to stave the crippling series of arrests that had swept the party.<ref>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" pp. 288\u2013289.</ref>\n\nComintern policy began to change in 1933 following the victory of the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany, leading to eventual advocacy of a so-called [[Popular Front]] against fascism by 1935.

Tensions worsened in 1940, when the [[Battle of Britain|Great Britain came under attack]] \u2013 a country to which New Zealanders felt a particular national affinity. Although membership in the CPNZ remained legal, ''People's Voice'' was suppressed by the government.<ref>Roth, \"New Zealand,\" pp. 338\u2013339.</ref>\n\nThe tide turned in June 1941 following the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]].

The party was divided between supporters of the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and those who claimed Khrushchev was a \"revisionist\" and chose instead to follow China under [[Mao Zedong]]. Subsequently, the CPNZ under the leadership of [[Victor Wilcox]] became the first official Communist party in the First World to side with Mao. The majority of the party and its newspaper ''The People's Voice'' adopted Maoism, while supporters of Khrushchev's [[Soviet Union]] (mainly Auckland trade unionists) split off to form the [[Socialist Unity Party (New Zealand)|Socialist Unity Party]].{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=29}} The Communist Party also maintained warm ties with the [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Indonesian Communist Party]] and supported Indonesia during the [[Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation]] (1963&ndash;1966). It also condemned the [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u201366|Indonesian mass killings]] that followed the alleged [[30 September Movement|30 September coup attempt]] as a right wing coup.{{sfn|Lim|2016|pp=49-53}}\n\nLater, when Mao died, the Communist Party of New Zealand began to follow the lead of [[Enver Hoxha]]'s [[Albania]], which they considered to be the last truly Communist country in the world. Members of the CPNZ national leadership who continued to uphold the line of the post-Mao [[Chinese Communist Party]] including Wilcox were expelled, and formed the [[Organisation for Marxist Unity \u2013 New Zealand|Preparatory Committee for the Formation of the Communist Party of New Zealand (Marxist\u2013Leninist)]].{{sfn|Alexander|2001|p=198}} \n\nMeanwhile, other former members of the CPNZ in Wellington, where the party branch had been expelled ''en masse'' in 1970, founded the Wellington Marxist Leninist Organisation, which in 1980 merged with the Northern Communist Organisation to form the [[Workers' Communist League (New Zealand)|Workers' Communist League]] (WCL).{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=29}}\n\nWhile the CPNZ never had mass influence or real political power, it pursued a Leninist vanguard party approach that involved trying to [[entryism|influence and penetrate]] the Labour Party, the  New Zealand trade union movement, various single-issue protest groups and public opinion on foreign policy, industrial activity, opposition to New Zealand's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], [[M\u0101ori protest movement|M\u0101ori rights]], the anti-[[Apartheid]] movement, feminism, and [[nuclear disarmament]], and anti-colonial activism in the Pacific region; issues in which communists and non-communist left-wing elements found common cause.{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|pp=29-30}}\n\n===Decline and legacy===\nAfter the collapse of Communism in Albania, the Communist Party of New Zealand gradually changed its views, renouncing its former support of [[Stalinism]], [[Maoism]], and [[Enver Hoxha|Hoxhaism]]. Instead, under the leadership of its last general secretary, [[Grant Morgan]], it developed a [[State Capitalist]] analysis of the Stalinist states. The party now believed that the Soviet Union had never been socialist at all, not even in Stalin's time. Opponents of this change departed and established the [[Communist Party of Aotearoa]] (a Maoist group) and the Marxist\u2013Leninist Collective (a pro-Hoxha group). The Communist Party of New Zealand eventually merged with the neo-Trotskyist [[International Socialist Organization (New Zealand)|International Socialist Organization]] in 1994. The resultant party, known as the [[Socialist Workers Organization (New Zealand)|Socialist Workers Organization]], evolved into the small but highly active [[Socialist Worker (Aotearoa)]]. However, most of the ISO members split off again and resumed their own organisation. SW voted to dissolve itself at its conference in January 2012.
