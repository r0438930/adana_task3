This bread is often referred to as whole-wheat but in fact is not: the flour used is mostly so-called ''grey flour'' of 85% extraction (meaning that some but not all of the wheat bran is retained). According to Poil\u00e2ne's own website, the dough also contains 30% [[spelt]], an ancestor of wheat.\n\n== life ==\nHis father, Pierre Poil\u00e2ne started a baking business in 1932, creating bread using stone-ground flour, [[Yeast (baking)|natural fermentation]] and a wood-fired oven.  Lionel took over the bakery in 1970, continuing the traditional methods.\n\n[[Image:Pain Po\u00eelane- Paris 15e.jpg|thumb|''Pain Poil\u00e2ne'' (Poil\u00e2ne bread)]]\nIn addition to ''miches'', the Poil\u00e2ne bakery offers [[rye]] bread, raisin bread, nut bread, Punitions ([[shortbread]] cookies), and an assortment of pastries to its clients.  Poil\u00e2ne is perhaps one of the most famous names in the baking industry today.\n\nPoil\u00e2ne mastered his single product and trained his apprentices in the physical baking process, which he believed to be the most important aspect of his vision.  He believed as much of the work as possible should be done by hand, by one person taking responsibility for their loaves from start to finish.  Lionel Poil\u00e2ne laid the basis of a concept he called \"retro-innovation\"; combining the best of traditional elements together with the best of modern developments.  The only deviation from his father's original formula was machine kneading, saving hours of work for his bakers.  He was knighted as a Knight of the National Order of Merit for services to the economy in 1993.\n\n''Pain Poil\u00e2ne'' is produced in the [[Latin Quarter]] of [[Paris]] where it is sold at the original ''boulangerie'' on ''rue du Cherche-Midi''.  A second Paris bakery on ''boulevard de Grenelle'' is located in the [[15th arrondissement of Paris|15th arrondissement]].  The worldwide demand for Poil\u00e2ne bread is met in a facility located in [[Bi\u00e8vres, Essonne|Bi\u00e8vres]] which was built in the 1980s.  The Bi\u00e8vres bakery produces around 15,000 loaves per day in 24 wood-burning ovens which are exact replicas of the ovens used at the Paris locations.  These loaves are shipped worldwide.  The firm opened a facility in [[London|London's]] [[Belgravia]] district in June 2000.\n\nOn October 31, 2002, Lionel Poil\u00e2ne was killed when the helicopter he was piloting crashed into the bay of [[Cancale]], off the coast of [[Brittany]].  The passengers, Poil\u00e2ne's wife Ir\u00e9na and their dog, also died in the crash.  Poil\u00e2ne was survived by daughters Athena and [[Apollonia Poil\u00e2ne|Apollonia]], who now runs the enterprise. Apollonia is a graduate of [[Harvard University]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Sancton |first=Tom |url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/01/22/8397991/index.htm |title=Apollonia Poil\u00e2ne inherits a famous Paris bakery - January 22, 2007 |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=January 19, 2001 |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202120721/http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/01/22/8397991/index.htm |archivedate=February 2, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/12/13/apollonia-u-poilane-apollonia-u-poilane/ |title=Apollonia U.
