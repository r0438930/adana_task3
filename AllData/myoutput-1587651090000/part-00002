In this historical context, PRS comprises three stages equivalent to those subsumed within PRS: thesis (intellectual proposition, problem), antithesis (negation of the proposition, response to thesis), and synthesis (resolution of tension between proposition and reaction, resolution).

Without any protective clothing they lifted aside the burning wreckage and, with great difficulty, succeeded in extricating the injured man.
