It is found in [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[South Africa]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. Its natural [[habitat]]s are dry [[savannah]], [[subtropical or tropical dry shrubland]], and rural gardens.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\nThe lemon-breasted canary was identified as species in 1960 by Clancey and Lawson from a type obtained near Panda, in [[Inhambane Province]] of southern Mozambique. Research involving mitochondrial DNA analysis suggests that this species along with ''[[Crithagra leucopygius|S. leucopygia]]'', ''[[Serinus mozambicus|S. mozambicus]]'', and ''[[Serinus dorsostriatus|S. dorsostriatus]]'' belong in a separate genus, ''Ochrospiza'', as they have been revealed to be only distantly related to other African members of the present genus, ''Serinus''. However, before a revision can be made, a detailed inspection of all the taxa in the current genus is necessary. Some consider this species to be a hybrid between ''[[Serinus atrogularis|S. atrogularis]]'' and ''S. mozambicus''.<ref>\"Lemon-breasted Canary (Serinus citrinipectus).\" Handbook of the Birds of the World: Alive.

However, both sexes have noticeably yellow rumps around the tail feathers and bicolored beaks, the upper part being darker brown/black than the lower part.  In addition, males also have white and yellow cheek patches and two yellow and white dots above their beaks. Nestlings of this species show yellow beak edges.

Their song is brief, rapid, and relatively tuneless and occurs in a series of short rising and falling twittering. Their breeding season occurs between December and May, but main activity is in January and February. These birds are monogamous and are fairly solitary and territorial. The courtship process in general is less complex than in most other finches, mostly involving singing and the raised posture of the males with slightly extended wings to attract females. Maturity of the males is measured during this time by their singing and courting. In captivity chicks are fed by females with egg food, germinated seeds, and some animal food during their first week of life. Overall the lemon-breasted canary is sedentary and partially nomadic, and during non-breeding season the flocks move about at random within their home range.<ref>\"Lemon-breasted Canary, Lemon-breasted Serin.\" Serinus Society: European Society of Serinus Breeders.

This is mostly due to overall pressures on the palms in which they reside (which are used for furniture manufacturing) as well as capture for the cage bird trade. That said, in some locations such as the deforested Shire Valley of Malawi, the populations of lemon-breasted canaries are seemingly increasing. In the particular example of the Shire Valley, this is likely due to its adaptability to a wide variety of grassland habitats. One study has estimated that at least 2,000 individuals are exported from the population of southern Mozambique each year, leading to a decline of populations in that area.<ref>\"Lemon-breasted Seedeater Serinus Citrinipectus.\" BirdLife International.
