They each discover hardships in their new roles, however, as the switch causes a strain on the family's relationship, and eventually resulting in the ultimate consequence.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Steve Callaghan]] and directed by Joseph Lee. It received mostly positive reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 6.55 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by [[Gary Cole]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Rachael MacFarlane]], [[Laura Vandervoort]], [[Lisa Wilhoit]], and [[Nina Dobrev]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \"Trading Places\" was one of five episodes submitted for consideration for an [[Emmy Award]] in the \"[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]]\" category in 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nA drunk [[List of Family Guy characters|Tom Tucker]] appears on television, announcing a contest to win a dirtbike. [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] decides to enter the contest, in which the person who keeps their hand on the bike the longest wins. As time goes on, competitors continually begin to give up. Nine hours later, the last two contestants remaining are Peter and [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor Adam West]], the latter of whom is tricked into taking his hand off the bike when Peter sends him a text message with his free hand. The next day, Peter's children, Chris and Meg decide to get on the bike and take it for a ride through [[Family Guy#Setting|Quahog]]. Daring Meg he can jump over a fire hydrant, Chris suddenly crashes the bike, completely destroying it. Once their parents, Peter and Lois, discover that they crashed the bike (and Peter \"punishes\" Chris by making him [[Tobacco smoking|start smoking]]), they decide to teach the two a lesson by switching roles in the family. Meg and Chris then become the parents, dressing more conservatively, with Meg doing housework and Chris going to the brewery where their father works, and Lois and Peter begin attending school.\n\nPeter and Lois undergo constant hard school work beyond their generation, as well as having to keep up a social status all the time, and dealing with bullies. Meanwhile, Meg and Chris find adult work to be very easy to handle. Meg's youth allows her to finish all the housework in under an hour, while making a fine dining dinner, while Chris accomplishes a great deal of work Peter had been slacking off in. Once Chris begins working, his boss, [[List of Family Guy characters|Angela]], is surprised to see his work ethic and offers him a raise. That night, after returning home, Chris and Meg alert their parents that switching roles is easier than they thought, with Lois and Peter admitting that they are suffering and being bullied in school. Wanting to call off the role switching, Peter and Lois attempt to get their children to go back to school, but Chris refuses. Chris then tells his father that he has been hired at the brewery as Peter's replacement. Chris then alerts his parents that he is now the breadwinner, and can make his own rules. In the meantime, Peter attempts to find a new job, as Chris begins working overtime at the brewery. Becoming exhausted by work, Chris begins drinking, and taking his anger and frustration out on the family, and eventually suffers a [[heart attack]]. Realizing being an adult is just as hard as being a kid, Chris agrees to go back to the way things used to be, and the family goes back to normal, with the exception of Dr. Hartman questioning them about their antics when the screen goes black.\n\n==Production and development==\n[[File:Steve Callaghan by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|right|thumb|155px|[[Steve Callaghan]] wrote the episode.]]\nThe episode was written by series regular, executive producer and [[showrunner]] [[Steve Callaghan]], and directed by series regular Joseph Lee during the course of the [[Family Guy (season 9)|ninth production season]].<ref name=\"episode\">{{cite episode |title=Trading Places|series=Family Guy |serieslink=Family Guy |credits=Callaghan, Steve; Lee, Joseph; MacFarlane, Seth|network=Fox |airdate=2010-03-20 |season=09 |number=13}}</ref> Series veterans [[Peter Shin]] and [[James Purdum]], both of whom having previously served as animation directors, served as supervising directors for the episode,<ref name=\"episode\"/> with [[Andrew Goldberg (writer)|Andrew Goldberg]], Alex Carter, [[Elaine Ko]], Spencer Porter and [[Aaron Blitzstein]] serving as [[staff writer]]s for the episode.<ref name=\"episode\"/> Composer [[Ron Jones (composer)|Ron Jones]], who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for \"Trading Places\".<ref name=\"episode\"/>\n\nIn addition to the regular cast, actor [[Gary Cole]], actress [[Nina Dobrev]], actress [[Carrie Fisher]], voice actress [[Rachael MacFarlane]], actress [[Laura Vandervoort]], and voice actress [[Lisa Wilhoit]] guest starred in the episode.
