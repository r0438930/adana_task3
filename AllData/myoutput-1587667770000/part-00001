George and Arthur Dobson set out in March 1864, later to be joined by their brother Edward at [[Craigieburn, New Zealand|Craigieburn]]. While George surveyed road lines there, Edward and Arthur proceeded to explore the high country. On the advice of West Coast [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] chief Tarapuhi, they found a pass that steeply descended to what became known as [[Otira]]; the route had long been used by M\u0101ori for trading [[pounamu]].

Edward Dobson was commissioned to examine every possible pass to the West Coast from the watersheds of the Waimakariri, [[Taramakau River|Taramakau]] and [[Hurunui River]]s. After finishing his examination, he declared that \"Arthur's pass\" was by far the most suitable to get to the gold fields.<ref name=\"Te Ara Dobson Brothers\" /> The provincial government decided that a road was to be built between Christchurch and Hokitika, a distance of {{convert|156|miles|km}}, and Edward Dobson was put in charge of the project.<ref name=\"Te Ara Dobson Brothers\" /> The road was opened on 20 March 1866.<ref name=\"DNZB Dobson\" /> The alpine pass became known as [[Arthur's Pass (mountain pass)|Arthur's Pass]], with a [[Arthur's Pass|nearby village]] and a later a [[Arthur's Pass National Park|national park]] also taking this name.<ref name=\"Arthur's Pass discovery\" />\n\n;Australia\nDobson resigned as provincial engineer in 1868 and moved to Australia the following year. He undertook engineering work for a railway company in Melbourne, and water supply engineering work in Melbourne and [[Geelong]]. He returned to New Zealand in 1876.<ref name=\"NZHPT bio\" />\n\n;New Zealand again\nIn 1878, Edward Dobson went into a formal partnership with his son Arthur, which lasted until 1885. They were working on water supply schemes for [[Timaru]] and the [[Canterbury Plains]]. They surveyed the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] over the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]] and, in partnership with others, launched the [[New Zealand Midland Railway Company|Midland Railway Company]]. The venture was a failure, as it was underfunded. Eventually, the government took over the scheme, but the line between Christchurch and [[Greymouth]] was not finished until 1923.<ref name=\"DNZB Dobson\" />\n\nIn his later years, Edward Dobson concentrated on education. He had lectured since the 1860s, and his lectures to the [[Christchurch High School]] are regarded as \"the first attempt to make Physical Science a branch of regular instruction in this colony\". He published papers for the Philosophical Institute of Canterbury and the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] in London, which awarded him the [[Telford Medal]] for the 1868\u20131869 session for a paper entitled ''The public works of the province of Canterbury, New Zealand''.<ref name=\"DNZB Dobson\" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Engineering: Volume 10|year=1870|publisher=Design Council|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0xCAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA306 |accessdate=9 May 2011|page=306}}</ref>\n\nHe helped establish the Engineering School of the Canterbury College, which became the [[University of Canterbury]], and lectured until 1892.

George and Arthur Dobson set out in March 1864, later to be joined by their brother Edward at [[Craigieburn, New Zealand|Craigieburn]]. While George surveyed road lines there, Edward and Arthur proceeded to explore the high country. On the advice of West Coast [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] chief Tarapuhi, they found a pass that steeply descended to what became known as [[Otira]]; the route had long been used by M\u0101ori for trading [[pounamu]]. Arthur prepared a report, which included a sketch of the unnamed pass, and presented it to Cass.<ref name=\"DNZB Dobson\" /><ref name=\"Arthur's Pass discovery\">{{cite web|title=Arthur's Pass 'discovered'|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/timeline&new_date=12/03|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=7 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Edward Dobson, 1866.jpg|thumb|right|Edward Dobson, ca 1866]]\nSoon after, the discovery of gold triggered the [[West Coast Gold Rush]]. Edward Dobson was commissioned to examine every possible pass to the West Coast from the watersheds of the Waimakariri, [[Taramakau River|Taramakau]] and [[Hurunui River]]s. After finishing his examination, he declared that \"Arthur's pass\" was by far the most suitable to get to the gold fields.<ref name=\"Te Ara Dobson Brothers\" /> The provincial government decided that a road was to be built between Christchurch and Hokitika, a distance of {{convert|156|miles|km}}, and Edward Dobson was put in charge of the project.<ref name=\"Te Ara Dobson Brothers\" /> The road was opened on 20 March 1866.<ref name=\"DNZB Dobson\" /> The alpine pass became known as [[Arthur's Pass (mountain pass)|Arthur's Pass]], with a [[Arthur's Pass|nearby village]] and a later a [[Arthur's Pass National Park|national park]] also taking this name.<ref name=\"Arthur's Pass discovery\" />\n\n;Australia\nDobson resigned as provincial engineer in 1868 and moved to Australia the following year. He undertook engineering work for a railway company in Melbourne, and water supply engineering work in Melbourne and [[Geelong]]. He returned to New Zealand in 1876.<ref name=\"NZHPT bio\" />\n\n;New Zealand again\nIn 1878, Edward Dobson went into a formal partnership with his son Arthur, which lasted until 1885. They were working on water supply schemes for [[Timaru]] and the [[Canterbury Plains]]. They surveyed the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] over the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]] and, in partnership with others, launched the [[New Zealand Midland Railway Company|Midland Railway Company]]. The venture was a failure, as it was underfunded. Eventually, the government took over the scheme, but the line between Christchurch and [[Greymouth]] was not finished until 1923.<ref name=\"DNZB Dobson\" />\n\nIn his later years, Edward Dobson concentrated on education. He had lectured since the 1860s, and his lectures to the Christchurch High School are regarded as \"the first attempt to make Physical Science a branch of regular instruction in this colony\". He published papers for the Philosophical Institute of Canterbury and the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] in London, which awarded him the [[Telford Medal]] for the 1868\u20131869 session for a paper entitled ''The public works of the province of Canterbury, New Zealand''.<ref name=\"DNZB Dobson\" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Engineering: Volume 10|year=1870|publisher=Design Council|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0xCAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA306 |accessdate=9 May 2011|page=306}}</ref>\n\nHe helped establish the Engineering School of the Canterbury College, which became the [[University of Canterbury]], and lectured until 1892.
