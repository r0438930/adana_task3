Technical documents, training materials, test suites, reference implementations and other interoperability resources developed in OGC Interoperability Initiatives are available on our resources page.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://wwwdev.opengeospatial.org/resources |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005051654/http://wwwdev.opengeospatial.org/resources |archive-date=2017-10-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In addition, the OGC and its members support publications, workshops, seminars and conferences<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ogc.org/event|title=Events List - times on this page are GMT &#124; OGC|website=www.ogc.org}}</ref> to help technology developers, integrators and procurement managers introduce OGC plug and play capabilities into their architectures.\n\n==Membership==\nThe OGC is an open membership organization. The OGC offers a range of membership options for industry, government, academic, research and not-for-profit organizations interested in supporting the Consortium's global mission<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ogc.org/ogc/join|title=Membership Levels &#124; OGC|website=www.ogc.org}}</ref>\n\n==Collaboration==\nThe OGC has a close relationship with [[ISO/TC 211]] (Geographic Information/Geomatics). Volumes from the ISO 19100 series under development by this committee progressively replace the OGC abstract specification. Further, the OGC standards Web Map Service, GML, Web Feature Service, [[Observations and Measurements]], and Simple Features Access have become ISO standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opengeospatial.org/pressroom/pressreleases/1374|title=OGC Web Feature Service Standard accepted as ISO Standard|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nThe OGC works with more than 20 international standards-bodies including [[W3C]], [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]], [[Workflow Management Coalition|WfMC]], and the [[IETF]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=6207&ei=haJwVY7ZOcfusAXb4oK4DA&usg=AFQjCNEKzXyIOXuYNii4cRrwGU6wfD4BgQ&sig2=41F6mU19BEdW_td2wCIrIQ&bvm=bv.94911696,d.b2w|title=OGC\u2019s Role in the Spatial Standards World}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[GeoTools]] \u2013 implements OGC standards as OGC releases them\n*[[Open Source Geospatial Foundation]] (OSGeo)\n*[[List of geographic information systems software]]\n*[[Comparison of geographic information systems software]]\n*[[OpenLayers]]\n*[[Semantic Sensor Web]]\n*[[Weather Information Exchange Model]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}}\n\n{{OGC}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Open Geospatial Consortium| ]]\n[[Category:Earth sciences metadata conventions]]\n[[Category:Geographic information systems organizations]]\n", "name_user": "Dadasacks", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Geospatial_Consortium"}
