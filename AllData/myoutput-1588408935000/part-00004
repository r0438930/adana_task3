The MINECON 2011 convention was held in [[Las Vegas]] and celebrated the launch of the game with ''Minecraft''-related discussion panels and gaming areas. The most recent convention, held in [[Anaheim]], had 12,000 attendees. Since 2017, MINECON has taken the form of an interactive live stream, and as such MINECON 2016 was the last full MineCon convention currently. However, similar conventions, now to be known as Minecraft Festival, will be held in the future as announced in MINECON Live 2019.\n\n==Events by year==\n===2010===\nMinecraftCon 2010 was a gathering of more than 30 people at [[Bellevue, Washington]] on 31 August. [[Markus Persson]] made an appearance at the meet-up when several requests were made for a community meet-up, so he called on the community to pick no specific venue.<ref name=\"2010-spontaneus\" /> This was not technically a convention, but some count it as the first ''Minecraft'' convention.\n\n===2011===\n5,000 people attended the first official MineCon convention held in [[Las Vegas]] on 18 November 2011.<ref name=\"MCV-2012-paris\" /> The convention focused on celebrating the game's release and hosted ''Minecraft''-related discussion panels, and invited people to play the game with others while at the convention.<ref name=\"MCV-2012-paris\" /> There were keynote speeches from members of the community, building contests, costume contests and exhibits. One of the many events at MINECON was the \"Nether Party\", an event for those aged 21 and over, featuring [[deadmau5]]. This event also marked the release of Minecraft 1.0 to the public, officially taking the game out of beta.\n\n===2012===\nOn 2 August 2012, [[Mojang]] announced that the 2012 MineCon convention would take place in the [[Paris]] [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Park]] on 24 and 25 November.<ref name=\"eurogamer-2012-paris\" /><ref name=\"joystiq-2012-paris\" /> The announcement was made over the social networking platform [[Twitter]] when the game's creator, [[Markus Persson]], posted a short trailer revealing the new convention location.<ref name=\"eurogamer-2012-paris\" /> The video shows Mojang team members wearing Disney paraphernalia, and Persson comments to lead developer [[Jens Bergensten]], \"I think they are trying to tell us something\".<ref name=\"gi.biz-2012\" /><ref name=\"yt-2012-announcement\" /> [[Joystiq]]'s JC Fletcher said that the site was a \"step up\" from the first MINECON's location in Las Vegas.<ref name=\"joystiq-2012-paris\" /> The second annual convention was the first held outside of the United States, making it available to European fans who might not have been able to attend the first.<ref name=\"ign-2012-venue\" /> It was held in the wake of ''Minecraft'''s growing popularity as the [[Xbox 360]] version of the game sold 3 million copies.<ref name=\"ign-2012-venue\" /> 2012 was also the start of several in-game unofficial MINECONs, notably a Virtual MINECON,<ref name=\"forum-1\" /> which although an unofficial event, was attended by a member of the Mojang Team.<ref name=\"2013-virtual-vip\" /> Many in-game MINECONs have announced an intent to return with the start of the next MINECON.<ref name=\"2013-virtual\" />\n\nThe convention in 2012 was attended by 4,500 fans.<ref name=\"pcgamer-2012\" /> Mojang made several announcements at the 2012 convention. Details about the 1.5 \"Redstone\" update were revealed as well as information on the game's modding [[API]].<ref name=\"MCV-2012-over\" />\n\n===2013===\nIn April 2013, Lydia Winters revealed that MINECON 2013 would be held in the United States.<ref name=\"winters-2013-US\" /> [[Jens Bergensten]] later said that it would be on the [[East coast of the United States|east coast]].<ref name=\"jeb-2013-US\" /> On 27 June, it was announced on Mojang's YouTube Channel that MINECON 2013 will be held in [[Orlando, Florida]].<ref name=\"yt-2013\" /> The website for the [[Orange County Convention Center]] had listed MineCon as an upcoming event in November, with an attendance of 7,500,<ref name=\"ocounty-calendar-2013\" /> but then removed the event from the web page.<ref name=\"ocounty-calendar-2013\" /> Tickets went on sale in three batches each of 2,500 tickets on 31 July 2 August, and 3 August. The first batch of 2,500 tickets was sold out in three seconds, according to Mojang [[Chief operating officer|COO]] Vu Bui.<ref name=\"2014-tickets-3sec\" /> The event took place on 2 and 3 November.\n\n===2014 (cancelled)===\nOn 30 March 2014, Lydia Winters revealed in a tweet that MINECON 2014 would be held in Europe.<ref name=\"winters-2014-europe\" /> However, on 21 August 2014, Vu Bui created a blog post, stating that there would be no MineCon 2014, but instead the next MineCon would be in Spring 2015 in London.<ref name=\"mojang-2015\" />\n\n===2015===\n{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIdvjx6kDk4 MineCon 2015 Opening Ceremony Animation]}}\n\n[[File:MineCon2015ExpoHall.jpg|thumb|right|The Expo Hall at MineCon 2015]]\nOn 2 February 2015, Vu Bui announced MINECON 2015 would be held in [[London]], at the [[ExCeL London|ExCeL London Exhibition and Conference Centre]] on 4 and 5 July 2015.<ref name=\"mojang-2015-announcement\" /> Ticket prices were announced on 18 March 2015 and were set at \u00a3129.

After this announcement came the introduction of 'Official Community Events', which allow events such as Minefaire, Minevention and Multiplay's BlockFest to be considered 'Official Minecraft Conventions'.\nDuring MINECON Earth, developers announced the next major update, the \"Update Aquatic\"; this update was released in July 2018. Vu Bui, [[Chief operating officer|COO]] of Mojang, also announced the winning mob based on a community vote: \"The Monster of The Night Skies\", later named the \"phantom\".<ref name=\"eurogamer-2017-mob\" />\n\n===2018===\nOn 10 April 2018, Mojang announced that MINECON Earth would be taking place on 29 September 2018 for 90 minutes on stream.<ref name=\"onmsft-2018-earth\" /><ref name=\"digitaltrends-2018\" /> During the event, Mojang announced ''[[Minecraft#Minecraft: Dungeons|Minecraft: Dungeons]]'', a dungeon-crawler spin-off of ''Minecraft'', and features of the upcoming \"Village & Pillage\" update, which was released in April 2019. Viewers voted for one of three in-game biomes to be updated in the next update;<ref name=\"shack-2018-earth\" /> the Taiga biome won the vote.\n\n=== 2019 ===\nOn 17 May 2019, MINECON Live 2019 was announced to be held on 28 September of that year, changing the name of the event from \"MINECON Earth\" to \"MINECON Live\" to avoid confusion with their new game ''[[Minecraft Earth]]''.<ref name=\"playerone-2019-live\" /><ref name=\"comicbook-2019-live\" /> Like the previous year, viewers were able to vote for new features to be added to one of three in-game biomes in a following update;<ref name=\"eurogamer-2019-biome\" /> the Mountains biome won the vote.

previous [[fan convention]] about the video game ''[[Minecraft]]'', hosted by [[Mojang]].<ref name=\"pcgamer-2012\" /> The first gathering in 2010 was known as ''MinecraftCon''. The MINECON 2011 convention was held in [[Las Vegas]] and celebrated the launch of the game with ''Minecraft''-related discussion panels and gaming areas. The most recent convention, held in [[Anaheim]], had 12,000 attendees. Since 2017, MINECON has taken the form of an interactive live stream, and as such MINECON 2016 was the last full MineCon convention currently. However, similar conventions, now to be known as Minecraft Festival, will be held in the future as announced in MINECON Live 2019.\n\n==Events by year==\n===2010===\nMinecraftCon 2010 was a gathering of more than 30 people at [[Bellevue, Washington]] on 31 August. [[Markus Persson]] made an appearance at the meet-up when several requests were made for a community meet-up, so he called on the community to pick no specific venue.<ref name=\"2010-spontaneus\" /> This was not technically a convention, but some count it as the first ''Minecraft'' convention.\n\n===2011===\n5,000 people attended the first official MineCon convention held in [[Las Vegas]] on 18 November 2011.<ref name=\"MCV-2012-paris\" /> The convention focused on celebrating the game's release and hosted ''Minecraft''-related discussion panels, and invited people to play the game with others while at the convention.<ref name=\"MCV-2012-paris\" /> There were keynote speeches from members of the community, building contests, costume contests and exhibits. One of the many events at MINECON was the \"Nether Party\", an event for those aged 21 and over, featuring [[deadmau5]]. This event also marked the release of Minecraft 1.0 to the public, officially taking the game out of beta.\n\n===2012===\nOn 2 August 2012, [[Mojang]] announced that the 2012 MineCon convention would take place in the [[Paris]] [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Park]] on 24 and 25 November.<ref name=\"eurogamer-2012-paris\" /><ref name=\"joystiq-2012-paris\" /> The announcement was made over the social networking platform [[Twitter]] when the game's creator, [[Markus Persson]], posted a short trailer revealing the new convention location.<ref name=\"eurogamer-2012-paris\" /> The video shows Mojang team members wearing Disney paraphernalia, and Persson comments to lead developer [[Jens Bergensten]], \"I think they are trying to tell us something\".<ref name=\"gi.biz-2012\" /><ref name=\"yt-2012-announcement\" /> [[Joystiq]]'s JC Fletcher said that the site was a \"step up\" from the first MINECON's location in Las Vegas.<ref name=\"joystiq-2012-paris\" /> The second annual convention was the first held outside of the United States, making it available to European fans who might not have been able to attend the first.<ref name=\"ign-2012-venue\" /> It was held in the wake of ''Minecraft'''s growing popularity as the [[Xbox 360]] version of the game sold 3 million copies.<ref name=\"ign-2012-venue\" /> 2012 was also the start of several in-game unofficial MINECONs, notably a Virtual MINECON,<ref name=\"forum-1\" /> which although an unofficial event, was attended by a member of the Mojang Team.<ref name=\"2013-virtual-vip\" /> Many in-game MINECONs have announced an intent to return with the start of the next MINECON.<ref name=\"2013-virtual\" />\n\nThe convention in 2012 was attended by 4,500 fans.<ref name=\"pcgamer-2012\" /> Mojang made several announcements at the 2012 convention. Details about the 1.5 \"Redstone\" update were revealed as well as information on the game's modding [[API]].<ref name=\"MCV-2012-over\" />\n\n===2013===\nIn April 2013, Lydia Winters revealed that MINECON 2013 would be held in the United States.<ref name=\"winters-2013-US\" /> [[Jens Bergensten]] later said that it would be on the [[East coast of the United States|east coast]].<ref name=\"jeb-2013-US\" /> On 27 June, it was announced on Mojang's YouTube Channel that MINECON 2013 will be held in [[Orlando, Florida]].<ref name=\"yt-2013\" /> The website for the [[Orange County Convention Center]] had listed MineCon as an upcoming event in November, with an attendance of 7,500,<ref name=\"ocounty-calendar-2013\" /> but then removed the event from the web page.<ref name=\"ocounty-calendar-2013\" /> Tickets went on sale in three batches each of 2,500 tickets on 31 July 2 August, and 3 August. The first batch of 2,500 tickets was sold out in three seconds, according to Mojang [[Chief operating officer|COO]] Vu Bui.<ref name=\"2014-tickets-3sec\" /> The event took place on 2 and 3 November.\n\n===2014 (cancelled)===\nOn 30 March 2014, Lydia Winters revealed in a tweet that MINECON 2014 would be held in Europe.<ref name=\"winters-2014-europe\" /> However, on 21 August 2014, Vu Bui created a blog post, stating that there would be no MineCon 2014, but instead the next MineCon would be in Spring 2015 in London.<ref name=\"mojang-2015\" />\n\n===2015===\n{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIdvjx6kDk4 MineCon 2015 Opening Ceremony Animation]}}\n\n[[File:MineCon2015ExpoHall.jpg|thumb|right|The Expo Hall at MineCon 2015]]\nOn 2 February 2015, Vu Bui announced MINECON 2015 would be held in [[London]], at the [[ExCeL London|ExCeL London Exhibition and Conference Centre]] on 4 and 5 July 2015.<ref name=\"mojang-2015-announcement\" /> Ticket prices were announced on 18 March 2015 and were set at \u00a3129. During the opening ceremony on 4 July 2015 it was announced by [[Guinness World Records]] that MineCon won the world record for the most attendance for a convention that is solely for one game, selling 10,000 tickets.<ref name=\"guiness-2015\" /><ref name=\"ign-2015\" />\n\n===2016===\nOn 7 March 2016, Mojang announced in a blog post that MINECON 2016 would be held in [[Anaheim, California]], at the [[Anaheim Convention Center]] on 24 and 25 September 2016.<ref name=\"mojang-2016\" /> They announced new features during that time, such as the [[Minecraft]] novel, ''Minecraft: The Island'', and an update coming to the console versions of the game.<ref name=\"BI-2016\" />\n\n===2017===\nOn 8 August 2017, Mojang announced that MINECON would be taking the form of an interactive [[livestream]] on 18 November 2017, dubbed \"MINECON Earth\".<ref name=\"MS-2017-inclusive\" /> The host of MINECON Earth is [[Will Arnett]], a Canadian actor. After this announcement came the introduction of 'Official Community Events', which allow events such as Minefaire, Minevention and Multiplay's BlockFest to be considered 'Official Minecraft Conventions'.\nDuring MINECON Earth, developers announced the next major update, the \"Update Aquatic\"; this update was released in July 2018. Vu Bui, [[Chief operating officer|COO]] of Mojang, also announced the winning mob based on a community vote: \"The Monster of The Night Skies\", later named the \"phantom\".<ref name=\"eurogamer-2017-mob\" />\n\n===2018===\nOn 10 April 2018, Mojang announced that MINECON Earth would be taking place on 29 September 2018 for 90 minutes on stream.<ref name=\"onmsft-2018-earth\" /><ref name=\"digitaltrends-2018\" /> During the event, Mojang announced ''[[Minecraft#Minecraft: Dungeons|Minecraft: Dungeons]]'', a dungeon-crawler spin-off of ''Minecraft'', and features of the upcoming \"Village & Pillage\" update, which was released in April 2019. Viewers voted for one of three in-game biomes to be updated in the next update;<ref name=\"shack-2018-earth\" /> the Taiga biome won the vote.\n\n=== 2019 ===\nOn 17 May 2019, MINECON Live 2019 was announced to be held on 28 September of that year, changing the name of the event from \"MINECON Earth\" to \"MINECON Live\" to avoid confusion with their new game ''[[Minecraft Earth]]''.<ref name=\"playerone-2019-live\" /><ref name=\"comicbook-2019-live\" /> Like the previous year, viewers were able to vote for new features to be added to one of three in-game biomes in a following update;<ref name=\"eurogamer-2019-biome\" /> the Mountains biome won the vote. During the livestream, developers of the game announced the \"Nether Update\". An [[early access]] release date of ''[[Minecraft Earth]]'' was also announced to be for October 2019.<ref name=\"wc-2019-roundup\" />\n\n=== 2020 ===\nOn 28 September 2019, Mojang announced ''Minecraft'' Festival, an in-person event that was to be held in Orlando, Florida, on 25\u201327 September 2020.<ref name=\"mojang-2020-festival\"  /> Due to the fears surrounding the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] the event was postponed to 2021.
