The NPS started with the decision of the Government of India to stop defined benefit pensions for all its employees who joined after 1 January 2004. While the scheme was initially designed for government employees only, it was opened up for all citizens of India in 2009. NPS is an attempt by the government to create a pensioned society in India. In its overall structure NPS is closer to 401(k) plans of the United States. Today, the NPS<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nps.karvy.com/|title=National Pension Scheme (NPS) in India|website=Karvy KCRA eNPS}}</ref> is readily available and tax efficient under Section 80CCC and Section 80CCD. Under the NPS, an individual can contribute to his retirement account. Also, his employer can contribute to the welfare and social security of the individual.\n\nNPS is a quasi-EET instrument in India where 40% of the corpus escapes tax at maturity, while 60% of the corpus is taxable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest/how-good-is-the-recently-revamped-nps/articleshow/55632329.cms|title=How good is the recently revamped NPS?}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/now-you-can-open-a-nps-account-completely-online-via-aadhar-without-sending-physical-documents/articleshow/56235215.cms|title=NPS: Now you can open a NPS account completely online via Aadhar without sending physical documents - The Economic Times|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/tax-parity-for-nps-and-epf-members-is-a-welcome-step/articleshow/56387353.cms|title=Tax parity for NPS and EPF members is a welcome step - The Economic Times|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref> Of the 60% taxable corpus, 40% is tax-exempt as it has to be compulsorily used to purchase an [[annuity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2017-arun-jaitley-likely-to-make-national-pension-system-totally-tax-free/509491/|title=Budget 2017: Arun Jaitley likely to make National Pension system totally tax-free|author=|date=16 January 2017|website=FinancialExpress.com|access-date=17 September 2017}}</ref> The [[annuity]] income will be taxed, though.

Based on the recommendations of the OASIS report, the Government of India introduced a new Defined Contribution Pension System for the new entrants to Central/State Government service, except to the Defence forces i.e. Army, Navy and Air Force, replacing the existing system of the Defined Benefit Pension System.\n\nOn 23 August 2003, the Interim Pension Fund Regulatory & Development Authority (PFRDA) was established through a resolution by the Government of India to \"promote old age income security by establishing, developing and regulating pension funds, to protect the interests of subscribers to schemes of pension funds and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\" The Pension Fund Regulatory & Development Authority Act was passed on 19 September 2013 and notified on 1 February 2014, thus setting up PFRDA as the regulator for pension sector in India. However, there remains a considerable amount of confusion with other entities like the Employee Provident Fund, pension funds run by life insurers, and mutual fund companies being outside the purview of PFRDA.\n\nThe contributory pension system was notified by the Government of India on 22 December 2003, now named the National Pension System (NPS) with effect from 1 January 2004. The NPS was subsequently extended to all citizens of the country with effect from 1 May 2009, including self-employed professionals and others in the unorganized sector on a voluntary basis.\n\n==Architecture==\nUnlike traditional financial products where all the functions (sales, operations, service, fund management, depository) are done by one company, NPS follows an unbundled architecture where each step of the value chain has been made disjointed from the other. This unbundling not only allows the customer to mix and match his providers of service through the value chain, picking the best-suited option, but it also curbs the incidence of misselling.\n\nNPS architecture consists of the NPS Trust, which is entrusted with safeguarding subscribers' interests, Central Recordkeeping Agencies (CRAs) which maintains the data and records, Point of Presence (POP) as collection, distribution and servicing arms, pension fund managers (PFM) for managing the investments of subscribers, a custodian to take care of the assets purchased by the fund managers, and a trustee bank to manage the banking operations. At age 60 the customer can choose to purchase pension Annuity Service Providers (ASP). NPS investors can't opt for two pension fund managers, neither can switch to another pension fund before a year.  In 2017, PFRDA increased the entry age in NPS to 65 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Money/tdXgBZCrEbrzOUVEBHp3qM/You-can-continue-investing-in-NPS-even-after-retirement.html|title=You can continue investing in NPS even after retirement}}</ref>\n\nThe number of pension fund managers (PFM) has increased to seven in NPS:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Money/LmEMAB8K4qOusRorpNGqIO/Pension-gets-a-stronger-equity-push.html|title=Pension gets a stronger equity push|first=Deepti Bhaskaran & Shaikh Zoaib|last=Saleem|date=27 December 2016|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pick-the-best-nps-funds/articleshow/58567386.cms|title=How to select best NPS funds - Times of India|author=|date=|website=IndiaTimes.com|access-date=17 September 2017}}</ref>\n* SBI Pension Funds\n* LIC Pension Fund\n* UTI Retirement Solutions\n* HDFC Pension Fund\n* ICICI Prudential Pension Fund\n* Kotak Pension Fund\n* Birla Sun Life Pension Management Ltd\n\nSBI Pension Funds is the largest pension fund manager (PFM) in India and its assets under management(AUM) level is Rs 61,000 crore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-pension-funds-eyes-rs-65000-crore-aum-by-endfiscal_8268241.html|title=SBI Pension Funds eyes Rs 65,000 crore AUM by end of fiscal|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt present, central government employees have no say in the matter of choice of fund manager or investment allocation in NPS, as both are decided by the government.

The subscriber can choose any one of them. There are seven fund managers and eight annuity service providers for subscribers to choose from. The subscriber can choose to invest either, wholly or in combination, in four types of investment schemes offered by the pension fund managers. These are:\n\n* Scheme E (equity) which allows up to 75% equity participation, this is invested in stocks\n* Scheme C (corporate debt) which invests only in high-quality corporate bonds up to 100%\n* Scheme G (government/gilt bonds) which invests only in government bonds up to 100%\n* Scheme A (alternative investment) which allows up to 5% (newly added asset class only for private sector subscriber with active choice)\n\nAlternatively, the subscriber can opt for the default scheme, whereas per the time left to retirement his portfolio is rebalanced each year for the proportion of equity, corporate bonds, and government bonds.\n\nNPS offers two types of accounts to its subscribers:\n* Tier I :The primary account, which is a pension account which has restrictions on withdrawals and utilization of accumulated corpus. All the tax breaks that NPS offers are applicable only to Tier I accounts.\n* Tier II: In order to introduce some liquidity to the scheme, the PFRDA allows for a Tier II account where subscribers with pre-existing Tier I accounts can deposit and withdrawn monies as and when they want.

The NPS started with the decision of the Government of India to stop defined benefit pensions for all its employees who joined after 1 January 2004. While the scheme was initially designed for government employees only, it was opened up for all citizens of India in 2009. NPS is an attempt by the government to create a pensioned society in India. In its overall structure NPS is closer to 401(k) plans of the United States. Today, the NPS<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nps.karvy.com/|title=National Pension Scheme (NPS) in India|website=Karvy KCRA eNPS}}</ref> is readily available and tax efficient under Section 80CCC and Section 80CCD. Under the NPS, an individual can contribute to his retirement account. Also, his employer can contribute to the welfare and social security of the individual.\n\nNPS is a quasi-EET instrument in India where 40% of the corpus escapes tax at maturity, while 60% of the corpus is taxable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest/how-good-is-the-recently-revamped-nps/articleshow/55632329.cms|title=How good is the recently revamped NPS?}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/now-you-can-open-a-nps-account-completely-online-via-aadhar-without-sending-physical-documents/articleshow/56235215.cms|title=NPS: Now you can open a NPS account completely online via Aadhar without sending physical documents - The Economic Times|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/tax-parity-for-nps-and-epf-members-is-a-welcome-step/articleshow/56387353.cms|title=Tax parity for NPS and EPF members is a welcome step - The Economic Times|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref> Of the 60% taxable corpus, 40% is tax-exempt as it has to be compulsorily used to purchase an [[annuity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2017-arun-jaitley-likely-to-make-national-pension-system-totally-tax-free/509491/|title=Budget 2017: Arun Jaitley likely to make National Pension system totally tax-free|author=|date=16 January 2017|website=FinancialExpress.com|access-date=17 September 2017}}</ref> The [[annuity]] income will be taxed, though.

Based on the recommendations of the OASIS report, the Government of India introduced a new Defined Contribution Pension System for the new entrants to Central/State Government service, except to the Defence forces i.e. Army, Navy and Air Force, replacing the existing system of the Defined Benefit Pension System.\n\nOn 23 August 2003, the Interim Pension Fund Regulatory & Development Authority (PFRDA) was established through a resolution by the Government of India to \"promote old age income security by establishing, developing and regulating pension funds, to protect the interests of subscribers to schemes of pension funds and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\" The Pension Fund Regulatory & Development Authority Act was passed on 19 September 2013 and notified on 1 February 2014, thus setting up PFRDA as the regulator for pension sector in India. However, there remains a considerable amount of confusion with other entities like the Employee Provident Fund, pension funds run by life insurers, and mutual fund companies being outside the purview of PFRDA.\n\nThe contributory pension system was notified by the Government of India on 22 December 2003, now named the National Pension System (NPS) with effect from 1 January 2004. The NPS was subsequently extended to all citizens of the country with effect from 1 May 2009, including self-employed professionals and others in the unorganized sector on a voluntary basis.\n\n==Architecture==\nUnlike traditional financial products where all the functions (sales, operations, service, fund management, depository) are done by one company, NPS follows an unbundled architecture where each step of the value chain has been made disjointed from the other. This unbundling not only allows the customer to mix and match his providers of service through the value chain, picking the best-suited option, but it also curbs the incidence of misselling.\n\nNPS architecture consists of the NPS Trust, which is entrusted with safeguarding subscribers' interests, Central Recordkeeping Agencies (CRAs) which maintains the data and records, Point of Presence (POP) as collection, distribution and servicing arms, pension fund managers (PFM) for managing the investments of subscribers, a custodian to take care of the assets purchased by the fund managers, and a trustee bank to manage the banking operations. At age 60 the customer can choose to purchase pension Annuity Service Providers (ASP). NPS investors can't opt for two pension fund managers, neither can switch to another pension fund before a year.  In 2017, PFRDA increased the entry age in NPS to 65 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Money/tdXgBZCrEbrzOUVEBHp3qM/You-can-continue-investing-in-NPS-even-after-retirement.html|title=You can continue investing in NPS even after retirement}}</ref>\n\nThe number of pension fund managers (PFM) has increased to seven in NPS:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Money/LmEMAB8K4qOusRorpNGqIO/Pension-gets-a-stronger-equity-push.html|title=Pension gets a stronger equity push|first=Deepti Bhaskaran & Shaikh Zoaib|last=Saleem|date=27 December 2016|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pick-the-best-nps-funds/articleshow/58567386.cms|title=How to select best NPS funds - Times of India|author=|date=|website=IndiaTimes.com|access-date=17 September 2017}}</ref>\n* SBI Pension Funds\n* LIC Pension Fund\n* UTI Retirement Solutions\n* HDFC Pension Fund\n* ICICI Prudential Pension Fund\n* Kotak Pension Fund\n* Birla Sun Life Pension Management Ltd\n\nSBI Pension Funds is the largest pension fund manager (PFM) in India and its assets under management(AUM) level is Rs 61,000 crore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-pension-funds-eyes-rs-65000-crore-aum-by-endfiscal_8268241.html|title=SBI Pension Funds eyes Rs 65,000 crore AUM by end of fiscal|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt present, central government employees have no say in the matter of choice of fund manager or investment allocation in NPS, as both are decided by the government.
