As a teenager she dabbled with acting by playing a supporting role in [[Ram Mukherjee|her father]]'s Bengali-language film ''[[Biyer Phool]]'' (1996) and accepted a leading role in the 1996 social drama ''[[Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat]]'' on the insistence of her mother. Mukerji had her first commercial success with the action drama&nbsp;[[Ghulam (film)|''Ghulam'']] (1998) and breakthrough with the romance&nbsp;''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'' (1998). Following a brief setback, the year 2002 marked a turning point for her when she was cast by [[Yash Raj Films]] as the star of the drama ''[[Saathiya (film)|Saathiya]]''.\n\nMukerji established herself by starring in several top-grossing romantic films, including ''[[Chalte Chalte (2003 film)|Chalte Chalte]]'' (2003), ''[[Hum Tum]]'' (2004), ''[[Veer-Zaara]]'' (2004), and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), and the crime comedy ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005). She also gained praise for playing an abused wife in the political thriller ''[[Yuva]]'' (2004) and a deaf, blind and mute woman in the drama ''[[Black (2005 film)|Black]]'' (2005). Mukerji then collaborated with Yash Raj Films on several unsuccessful films which led critics to bemoan her choice of roles. This changed when she played a headstrong journalist in the semi-biographical thriller ''[[No One Killed Jessica]]'' (2011), and further success came for her starring roles in the thrillers ''[[Talaash: The Answer Lies Within]]'' (2012), ''[[Mardaani]]'' (2014) and its sequel ''[[Mardaani 2]]'' (2019), and the comedy-drama ''[[Hichki]]'' (2018). The lattermost emerged as her highest-grossing release.\n\nIn addition to acting in films, Mukerji is involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. She has participated in concert tours and stage shows, and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show ''[[Dance Premier League]]''. Reticent to discuss her personal life in public, Mukerji is married to filmmaker [[Aditya Chopra]], with whom she has a daughter.\n\n== Early life and background ==\n{{See also|Mukherjee-Samarth family}}\nRani Mukerji was born  in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] (present-day Mumbai) on 21 March 1978.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wish Rani Mukerji! |date=19 March 2008|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/mar/19wish.htm |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |accessdate=5 January 2011 |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921083402/http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/mar/19wish.htm|archivedate=21 September 2012 }}</ref> Her father, [[Ram Mukherjee]] (born to the [[Mukherjee-Samarth family]]), is a former film director and one of the founders of Filmalaya Studios.

As a teenager she dabbled with acting by playing a supporting role in [[Ram Mukherjee|her father]]'s Bengali-language film ''[[Biyer Phool]]'' (1996) and accepted a leading role in the 1996 social drama ''[[Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat]]'' on the insistence of her mother. Mukerji had her first commercial success with the action drama&nbsp;[[Ghulam (film)|''Ghulam'']] (1998) and breakthrough with the romance&nbsp;''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'' (1998). Following a brief setback, the year 2002 marked a turning point for her when she was cast by [[Yash Raj Films]] as the star of the drama ''[[Saathiya (film)|Saathiya]]''.\n\nMukerji established herself by starring in several top-grossing romantic films, including ''[[Chalte Chalte (2003 film)|Chalte Chalte]]'' (2003), ''[[Hum Tum]]'' (2004), ''[[Veer-Zaara]]'' (2004), and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), and the crime comedy ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005). She also gained praise for playing an abused wife in the political thriller ''[[Yuva]]'' (2004) and a deaf, blind and mute woman in the drama ''[[Black (2005 film)|Black]]'' (2005). Mukerji then collaborated with Yash Raj Films on several unsuccessful films which led critics to bemoan her choice of roles. This changed when she played a headstrong journalist in the semi-biographical thriller ''[[No One Killed Jessica]]'' (2011), and further success came for her starring roles in the thrillers ''[[Talaash: The Answer Lies Within]]'' (2012), ''[[Mardaani]]'' (2014) and its sequel ''[[Mardaani 2]]'' (2019), and the comedy-drama ''[[Hichki]]'' (2018). The lattermost emerged as her highest-grossing release.\n\nIn addition to acting in films, Mukerji is involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. She has participated in concert tours and stage shows, and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show ''[[Dance Premier League]]''. Reticent to discuss her personal life in public, Mukerji is married to filmmaker [[Aditya Chopra]], with whom she has a daughter.\n\n== Early life and background ==\n{{See also|Mukherjee-Samarth family}}\nRani Mukerji was born  in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] (present-day Mumbai) on 21 March 1978.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wish Rani Mukerji! |date=19 March 2008|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/mar/19wish.htm |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |accessdate=5 January 2011 |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921083402/http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/mar/19wish.htm|archivedate=21 September 2012 }}</ref> Her father, [[Ram Mukherjee]] (born to the [[Mukherjee-Samarth family]]), is a former film director and one of the founders of Filmalaya Studios.
