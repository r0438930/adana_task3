Five of its tracks would rise into the Top 40 of the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart in 1991 and 1992. They were \"Turn It On, Turn It Up, Turn Me Loose\" at No. 11, \"You're the One\" at No. 5, \"Nothing's Changed Here\" at No. 15, \"It Only Hurts When I Cry\" at No. 7 \"Send a Message to My Heart\", (a duet with fellow [[Pikeville, Kentucky]] native [[Patty Loveless]]) at No. 47, and finally the No. 18 \"The Heart That You Own\".  \n\n==Background==\nAfter recording three consecutive number one albums, Yoakam released the greatest hits collection ''Just Lookin\u2019 for a Hit'' in 1989.  His first three albums, beginning with ''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'' in 1986, contained several old songs he demoed in [[Nashville]] in 1982, with producer and guitarist Pete Anderson recalling, \u201c\u2026we\u2019d had twenty-one of his songs to record, and he wrote some new songs along the way.  But not a whole album of new songs.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=119}}  Consequently, his next LP would mostly be a clean slate.  Yoakam\u2019s previous album, ''Buenos Noches from a Lonely Room'', gave him his first two chart-topping country hits (\u201c[[Streets of Bakersfield]],\u201d a duet with his hero [[Buck Owens]], and \u201c[[I Sang Dixie]]\u201d) but it was the end of an era of sorts, with the singer later reflecting, \u201cI look at it this way \u2013 those albums are trilogies, in a sense, in retrospect.  It\u2019s like, I told \u2018em what I was gonna tell \u2018em\u2026I was tellin\u2019 \u2018em where I\u2019d come from, the legacy and culture that shaped my music.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=101}}  \n\n==Recording & Composition==\n''If There Was a Way'' features the most diverse set of material Yoakam had recorded up to that point, introducing rock and soul influences while retaining the [[Bakersfield]] [[honky-tonk]] sound that made him famous. The biggest departure is the title track, which incorporates a Hammond B-3 organ into the mix, giving the song more of a [[Muscle Shoals]] or [[Stax Records|Stax]] sound than Nashville or Bakersfield.  Yoakam cited [[Percy Sledge]] as the primary influence on the recording.{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=116}}  [[AllMusic]] comments, \u201cThe bluesy, doo-woppy, [[Doc Pomus]]-inspired rock balladry of the title track is another move toward the margins for Yoakam - especially with the shimmering B-3 work by Skip Edwards.\u201d<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/los-lobos-p99039/biography|title=Los Lobos - Biography|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref>  A driving doo-wop piano also infuses \u201cI Don\u2019t Need It Done\u201d while \u201cTakes a Lot to Rock You,\u201d \u201cDangerous Man,\u201d and the cover of [[Canned Heat]]\u2019s magnanimous \u201cLet\u2019s Work Together\u201d boast a more hard-edged rock sound foreshadowed by Yoakam\u2019s psychedelic cover of the [[The Blasters|Blasters]]'s \u201cLong White Cadillac\u201d found on ''Just Lookin\u2019 for a Hit'' the previous year.  \n\nAnother change was Yoakam collaborating with fellow songwriters such as [[Kostas]] and [[Roger Miller]].  The album\u2019s first single, \u201c[[Turn It On, Turn It Up, Turn Me Loose]],\u201d was written by Kostas and Wayland Patton, and it was producer Pete Anderson who brought the song to Yoakam, telling him, \u201c\u2026this is one song I came across that sounds like something you would have written for yourself.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=118}}  Yoakam and Kostas teamed up to compose \u201cNothing\u2019s Changed Here,\u201d which Anderson gave a bluesy, swaggering arrangement, and Kostas had a hand in writing the aching \u201cSend a Message to My Heart,\u201d which Yoakam performs as a duet with Patty Loveless.  Yoakam\u2019s other songwriting collaboration was on \u201c[[It Only Hurts When I Cry]]\u201d with country legend Roger Miller, and the song, which reached #7 on the country singles chart, contains the famous wordplay found in some of Miller\u2019s biggest hits.\n\nAlthough ''If There Was a Way'' shows Yoakam\u2019s \u201cfragmented musical personality\"<ref name=Allmusic/>, it also contains unremittingly bitter and despairing country originals, such as \u201cSad, Sad Music\u201d and the metaphorical \u201cThe Heart That You Own.\u201d  Although the latter only reached #18 on the country singles chart, it remains highly regarded ([[Bob Dylan]] has covered the song in concert) and proved Yoakam could still write songs of heartache on par with previous classics like \u201cJohnson\u2019s Love,\u201d \u201c1,000 Miles,\u201d and \u201cI Sang Dixie.\u201d  The albums biggest hit was the ballad \u201cYou\u2019re the One,\u201d which reached #5 and was the final song from his 1981 demo session to be used for a major label release.  Thom Jurek of AllMusic calls \u201cSince I Started Drinkin\u2019 Again\u201d (another old song played in Yoakam's 1986 set at the Roxy, which can be heard on the Rhino Deluxe Edition of ''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc, Etc.'') \u201c\u2026a bluegrass shitkicker, but it is one hell of a self-destructive broken-heart song that features some awesome fiddlework by Scott Joss and mandolin and backing vocals by Tim O'Brien.\u201d  Album opener \u201cThe Distance Between You and Me\u201d also incorporates banjo but, with its unconventional arrangement and exasperated lyrics, sounded downright surreal compared to most of what was on country radio in 1990.  (The non-performance sequences in the music videos Yoakam starred in for \u201cTurn it On, Turn it Up, Turn Me Loose\u201d and \u201cTakes a Lot to Rock You\u201d also verge on the bizarre and point the way to the former drama student\u2019s nascent acting career.)

A dominant theme found in Yoakam's new songs is the new absence of a lover, as he croons on the bridge of \"The Distance Between You and Me\":\n\n:''I lie awake and here you breathing\n:''Only inches from me in this bed\n:''Not much space nut it's all that we needed\n:''To live alone not that out love is dead\n\nOn \"Sad, Sad Music\" the narrator declares, \"I swear that I woke up with you this morning, but I can see that it's been days since you were here...\" while \"Nothing's Changed Here\" contains the lines \"I I feel you body lyin' next to mine, I reach out to touch you but you're not there for me to find...\"  Yoakam carries off these songs vocally with without a trace of irony, and the dark subject matter that dominates them, and the entire LP, may have played a part in his decision to conclude the album with \"Let's Work Together,' but, as Yoakam biographer Don McLeese writes, that particular cover song \"served to show there were interpretive limits to what Dwight could do.  He was far more convincing brooding about dark nights of the soul than celebrating the brotherhood of man.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=117}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe album rose to No. 7 on the Country Albums chart.<ref>{{cite news|title=A look back: Dwight Yoakam\u2019s \u2018If There Was A Way\u2019 20 years later|url=http://starcasm.net/archives/62252|publisher=Starcasm|agency=|date=24 August 2010}}</ref>  AllMusic: \u201cHere again the rock side of country, the soul side of rock, and the country side of soul are all wrapped here in Yokam's voice backed by a band who have a complete understanding of the tune.
