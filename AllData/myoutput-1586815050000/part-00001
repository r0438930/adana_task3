{"title_page": "Nines (notation)", "text_new": "[[Image:Four nines fine gold.jpeg|thumb|upright|1 troy ounce of four nines fine gold (999.9)]]\n'''Nines''' are an informal, [[logarithm]]ic notation for proportions very near to one, or equivalently percentages very near 100%. Their common uses including grading the purity of materials.\n\nPut simply, \"nines\" are the number of consecutive nines in a [[percentage]] such as 99% (two nines) or a [[decimal fraction]] such as 0.999 (three nines). The number of nines of a proportion {{var|x}} is\n\n<math>\\mathrm{nines} = -\\log_{10}(1-x)</math>\n\nHowever, there are different conventions for stating a non-[[integer]] number of nines. 99.5% could be expressed as \"two nines five\" or 2.3 nines, as outlined below.

Based on the system of [[millesimal fineness]], a metal is said to be ''one nine'' or ''one nine fine'' if it is 900 fine, or 90% pure. A metal that is 990 fine is then described as ''two nines fine'' and one that is 999 fine is described as ''three nines fine''. Thus, nines are a [[logarithmic scale]] of purity for very fine precious metals.
