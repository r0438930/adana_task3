They replaced the  [[Douglas AC-47 Spooky]] and operated alongside the early versions of the [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 Spectre]] gunship.\n\n==Design and development==\nBy late 1967, the idea of the fixed-wing gunship had been proven so successful, the United States Air Force was having a difficult time keeping up with demand.  The newer [[AC-130 gunship|AC-130s]] that had been created under '''Project Gunship II''' were effective, but were being mostly used for armed reconnaissance and [[interdiction]] of the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]].  Furthermore, the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130]] airframe was in active service as a transport, vital to the war effort in Southeast Asia. The Air Force desperately needed a new gunship to replace the vulnerable and underpowered [[AC-47 Spooky|AC-47]] in the close air support role, as well as supplementing the AC-130 in attacking targets on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.\n\nThe [[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar]] presented an obvious choice, having been phased out of front-line service in favor of the [[Fairchild C-123 Provider|C-123]] and C-130, and with the stock of available airframes in [[United States Air Force Reserve|U.S. Air Force Reserve]] being sufficient. In February 1968, under the USAF program '''Project Gunship III''', 26 C-119Gs were converted to AC-119G standard, initially taking on the name \"Creep\", but later assigned the callsign \"Shadow\".<ref>[http://www.strategic-air-command.com/aircraft/attack/ac119_gunship.htm \"Fairchild AC-119 Gunship 'Shadow'.\"] strategic-air-command. Retrieved: 8 May 2012.</ref>\n\nIn addition, [[Fairchild (aircraft manufacturer)|Fairchild-Hiller]], which was contracted for all the conversions, converted another 26 C-119Gs into AC-119Ks, primarily for the \"truck hunter\" role over the Ho Chi Minh Trail. These aircraft were called \"Stingers\" primarily in reference to the two [[M61 Vulcan]] 20-mm cannons they carried in addition to the AC-119G's four [[Minigun|GAU-2/A miniguns]]. The AC-119K could be visually distinguished by the addition of two [[General Electric J85]] turbojet engines in underwing pods. The conversions were completed at Fairchild-Hiller's facility in St. Augustine, Florida.\n\nProject Gunship III, being a follow-on to the success of the AC-130 series, meant that the AC-119 was a more advanced aircraft in both its iterations than the [[Douglas AC-47 Spooky|AC-47]]. Even the TIC AC-119G featured some of the most up-to-date [[electronic countermeasures]] and radar equipment, as well as more basic technology, including an AVQ-8 xenon light, a night observation sight, and an LAU-74/A flare launcher.\n\nThe AC-119K, designed to hit trucks on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, was more advanced. Included in the conversion was the AN/APN-147 Doppler navigation radar, AN/AAD-4 forward looking infrared, AN/APQ-133 side-looking beacon tracking radar and AN/APQ-136 search radar.\n\nThe armament scheme for both aircraft was simpler than that of the AC-130.  The AC-119G had a total of four GAU-2A/A miniguns in [[Minigun#Gun Pods and Mounts|SUU-11A/A]] pods, all on mounts similar to those used on early AC-47s. Like late-model AC-47s, these were soon changed to the purpose-built MXU-470/A minigun modules.  The AC-119K, needing a more powerful and longer range \"punch\" to take out vehicles, featured two M61 20-mm cannons in addition to the four miniguns of the AC-119G.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:AC-119 Stinger.png|thumb|right|300px|One of the J85 turbojet engines added to later models of the AC-119 is visible in this photo.]]\nBy November 1968, the aircraft had deployed to Vietnam and joined the [[14th Special Operations Wing]] at [[Nha Trang Air Base]].  The AC-119Gs were placed in the [[71st Special Operations Squadron]] which was formed from the activated 71st Troop Carrier Squadron, of the [[Air Force Reserve]] located at [[Bakalar Air Force Base]] in Columbus, Indiana. When the 71 SOS returned to continental USA in 1969, the gunships were taken over by the newly formed [[17th Special Operations Squadron|17 SOS]].\n \nThe AC-119Ks were placed in the [[18th Special Operations Squadron]].  With the addition of the two types, the 14 SOW for a time in 1968 was flying eight different aircraft from ten different bases in South Vietnam.  The 14 SOW was inactivated in 1971. Limited numbers continued to be operated out of Thailand as late as the fall of 1972, but the AC-119 was phased out shortly after from the US Air Force.  The AC-119G and 119K continued to serve with the [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] (RVNAF) until the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975.  During the Vietnam War, only five AC-119 Gunship IIIs were lost to all causes.<ref>Hobson 2001</ref>\n\n==Operators==\n; {{flag|South Vietnam}}\n[[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]]\n; {{USA}}\n[[United States Air Force]]\n* [[14th Special Operations Wing]] \u2013 [[Nha Trang Air Base]], [[South Vietnam]]\n:: [[17th Special Operations Squadron]] 1969\u20131971\n:: [[18th Special Operations Squadron]] 1969\u20131971\n:: [[71st Special Operations Squadron]] 1968\u20131969\n:: (Detachments at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base|Tan San Nhut]], [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan Rang]] and [[Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t Air Base|Phu Cat AB]])\n* [[56th Special Operations Wing]] \u2013 Nakhon Phanom Air Base, [[Thailand]]\n:: 18th Special Operations Squadron 1971\u20131972\n\n==Surviving example==\n* AC-119G Shadow, AF Ser.
