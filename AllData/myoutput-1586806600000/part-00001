Swift|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 9, 1942}}</ref> The split (which NBC conducted voluntarily in the event that its appeal to have the ruling overturned was denied) was enforced to expand competition in radio broadcasting in the [[United States]] as the industry had only a few companies such as NBC and [[CBS]] that dominated the radio market, and in particular, was intended to prevent the limited competition from dominating news and political broadcasting and projecting narrow [[point of view (philosophy)|points of view]]. Television [[History of television#United States and Canada|broadcasting was suspended]], however, during [[World War II]].\n\nRegular television news broadcasts on ABC began soon after the network signed on its initial [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated television station]] (WJZ-TV, now [[WABC-TV]]) and production center in [[New York City]] in August 1948. ABC news broadcasts have continued as the television network expanded nationwide, a process that took many years beginning with its launch in 1948. However, from the 1950s through the early 1970s, ABC News' programs (as was the case with the television network in general during that period) consistently ranked third in viewership behind news programs on [[CBS News|CBS]] and [[NBC News|NBC]]. Until the 1970s, the ABC television network had fewer [[network affiliate|affiliate stations]], as well as a weaker prime-time programming slate to be able to truly support the network's news operations in comparison to the two larger networks, each of which had established their radio news operations during the 1930s.\n\n===Under Roone Arledge===\nOnly after [[Roone Arledge]], the president of [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] at the time, was appointed as president of ABC News in 1977, at a time when the network's prime-time entertainment programs were achieving stronger ratings and drawing in higher advertising revenue and profits to the ABC corporation overall, was ABC able to invest the resources to make it a major source of news content. Arledge, known for experimenting with the broadcast \"model\", created many of ABC News' most popular and enduring programs, including ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'', ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]'', ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'', ''[[Nightline]]'' and ''[[Primetime (American TV program)|Primetime Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/obit/NEWarledgeobit.html|title=ESPN Classic \u2013 Arledge brought modern innovations to TV sports|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nABC News' longtime slogan, \"More Americans get their news from ABC News than from any other source\" (introduced in the late 1980s), was a claim referring to the number of people who watch, listen to and read ABC News content on television, radio and (eventually) the Internet, and not necessarily to the telecasts alone.<ref>{{cite press release|title=ABC News, Disney Online and ESPN.com Providing Extensive Line-Up of Podcast Content via the New iTunes Podcast Directory |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |publisher=The Walt Disney Company |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621053357/http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |archivedate=June 21, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 1998, ABC News (which owned an 80% stake in the service), [[Nine Network]] and [[ITN]] sold their respective interests in Worldwide Television News to the [[Associated Press]].

Swift|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 9, 1942}}</ref> The split (which NBC conducted voluntarily in the event that its appeal to have the ruling overturned was denied) was enforced to expand competition in radio broadcasting in the [[United States]] as the industry had only a few companies such as NBC and [[CBS]] that dominated the radio market, and in particular, was intended to prevent the limited competition from dominating news and political broadcasting and projecting narrow [[point of view (philosophy)|points of view]]. Television [[History of television#United States and Canada|broadcasting was suspended]], however, during [[World War II]].\n\nRegular television news broadcasts on ABC began soon after the network signed on its initial [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated television station]] (WJZ-TV, now [[WABC-TV]]) and production center in [[New York City]] in August 1948. ABC news broadcasts have continued as the television network expanded nationwide, a process that took many years beginning with its launch in 1948. However, from the 1950s through the early 1970s, ABC News' programs (as was the case with the television network in general during that period) consistently ranked third in viewership behind news programs on [[CBS News|CBS]] and [[NBC News|NBC]]. Until the 1970s, the ABC television network had fewer [[network affiliate|affiliate stations]], as well as a weaker prime-time programming slate to be able to truly support the network's news operations in comparison to the two larger networks, each of which had established their radio news operations during the 1930s.\n\n===Under Roone Arledge===\nOnly after [[Roone Arledge]], the president of [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] at the time, was appointed as president of ABC News in 1977, at a time when the network's prime-time entertainment programs were achieving stronger ratings and drawing in higher advertising revenue and profits to the ABC corporation overall, was ABC able to invest the resources to make it a major source of news content. Arledge, known for experimenting with the broadcast \"model\", created many of ABC News' most popular and enduring programs, including ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'', ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]'', ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'', ''[[Nightline]]'' and ''[[Primetime (American TV program)|Primetime Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/obit/NEWarledgeobit.html|title=ESPN Classic \u2013 Arledge brought modern innovations to TV sports|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nABC News' longtime slogan, \"More Americans get their news from ABC News than from any other source\" (introduced in the late 1980s), was a claim referring to the number of people who watch, listen to and read ABC News content on television, radio and (eventually) the Internet, and not necessarily to the telecasts alone.<ref>{{cite press release|title=ABC News, Disney Online and ESPN.com Providing Extensive Line-Up of Podcast Content via the New iTunes Podcast Directory |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |publisher=The Walt Disney Company |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621053357/http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |archivedate=June 21, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 1998, ABC News (which owned an 80% stake in the service), [[Nine Network]] and [[ITN]] sold their respective interests in Worldwide Television News to the [[Associated Press]].
