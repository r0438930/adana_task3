It is a direct sequel to the 2015 title ''[[Ori and the Blind Forest]]'', announced during [[E3 2017]], and was released on March 11, 2020. The game is a [[Ultra-high-definition television|4K UHD]], [[List of Xbox One X Enhanced games|Xbox One X Enhanced]] and [[Xbox Live|Xbox Play Anywhere]] title.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://gematsu.com/2017/06/ori-will-wisps-announced-xbox-one-windows-10|title=Ori and the Will of the Wisps announced for Xbox One|date=2017-06-11|work=Gematsu|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826072910/http://gematsu.com/2017/06/ori-will-wisps-announced-xbox-one-windows-10|archive-date=2017-08-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe game was developed by Moon Studios, a collective organization without a set location. The game's visuals were given an overhaul from the two-dimensional artwork in ''Blind Forest'', to the three-dimensional models played in multilayered backgrounds in ''Will of the Wisps''. The game maintains narrative continuity with ''Blind Forest'' and introduces new melee combat. \n\nUpon release, the game received universal acclaim for the Xbox One version and favourable acclaim for the Microsoft Windows version, with players and critics praising the game\u2019s visuals, improved combat, elements of exploration, environments, chase sequences, and soundtrack, though criticism was made at technical issues such as frame rate issues and visual bugs which were largely resolved with the day-one [[patch (computing)|patch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/03/10/xboxs-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-is-the-best-reviewed-game-of-2020-minus-technical-issues/#2591ff11c3ac|title=Xbox's 'Ori and the Will of the Wisps' Is The Best Reviewed Game Of 2020, Minus Techical Issues|last=Tassi|first=Paul|date=March 10, 2020|accessdate=April 28, 2020|work=[[Forbes]]}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\nPlayers assume control of Ori, a white guardian spirit. As Ori, players must jump, climb, glide, and swim between various platforms to solve intricate puzzles. Gameplay unfolds in the form of a [[Metroidvania]], with new abilities and upgrades allowing players to unlock previously inaccessible areas of the map. Some of the foundational gameplay elements were inspired by the ''[[Rayman]]'' and ''[[Metroid]]'' franchises.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.videogamer.com/news/soul-links-in-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-didnt-make-sense-says-developer |title= Soul Links in Ori and the Will of the Wisps \"didn't make sense\", says developer |last= Donovan |first= Imogen |date= March 9, 2020 |accessdate= March 15, 2020 |work= VideoGamer |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200314191058/https://www.videogamer.com/news/soul-links-in-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-didnt-make-sense-says-developer |archive-date= March 14, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nUnlike its predecessor ''[[Ori and the Blind Forest|Blind Forest]]'', ''Will of the Wisps'' relies on autosaving rather than manually placed \"soul links.\" The sequential upgrade system of the first title has been abandoned for a system of \u201cshards,\u201d which can be purchased or found throughout the game to upgrade or modify Ori\u2019s stats and attacks. Ori\u2019s attacks can be managed via a convenient radial menu, and orbs to increase Ori\u2019s health and energy can be found throughout the map. \n\nA new mode called Spirit Trials was revealed at [[Gamescom]] 2018. The mode challenges players to race to a goal in the fastest time possible. To enhance competition and strategy, players can see the best times and the routes taken by other players. <ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.windowscentral.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-preview |last= Corden |first= Jez |title= Ori and the Will of the Wisps is gorgeous, moving, and now, addictive |website= Windows Central |date= August 30, 2018 |accessdate= February 25, 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200225054703/https://www.windowscentral.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-preview |archive-date= February 25, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> ''Will of the Wisps'' also introduces side quests from NPCs to earn collectible items such as Gorlek Ores, which are used to expand the map.\n\n== Plot ==\n''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' takes place in the forest of Niwen and is narrated by the forest's Spirit Tree. The story picks up immediately after the events of ''Blind Forest'' with Kuro\u2019s last egg having hatched, giving birth to a baby owl named Ku whom Ori, Naru, and Gumo raise as part of their family. Ku is unable to fly because she was born with a damaged wing. Gumo affixes a feather to Kuro\u2019s damaged wing, and she and Ori fly off together, eventually taking themselves to Niwen where they are separated by a terrific storm. \n\nAfter regaining consciousness from the fall, Ori searches for Ku and discovers Kwolok, a toad in Inkwater Marsh who guards Niwen\u2019s inhabitants. Kwolok informs Ori that Ku was located in the Silent Woods, the former home of the Moki turned into a desolate graveyard. However, the path to the Silent Woods is barred by polluted water. In order to progress, Ori must set the wheels of The Wellspring back into motion. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. While Ori heads to The Wellspring, Naru and Gumo realize where Ori and Ku are and depart via a raft to find them. \n\nUpon setting The Wellspring\u2019s wheels back into motion and clearing Niwen\u2019s water, Ori proceeds to enter the Silent Woods and reunites with Ku. Shortly after, they encounter Shriek, a deformed owl who was an orphan since birth and rejected by the rest of her kind. Shriek attacks the pair and kills Ku. \n\nAfter Ori mourns for Ku, Kwolok explains that the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and can't help Ku in it's curent state. When the Spirit Willow died, the light of its power was shattered into five wisps that scattered across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed the Willow\u2019s guardian spirits and Shriek\u2019s parents before her birth. With the goal of restoring Niwen, Kwolok tasks Ori with finding the remaining four wisps of the Spirit Willow\u2019s light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength, and Heart of the Forest to reform the Willow's light. \n\nKwolok leaves Inkwater Marsh to help Ori find one of the wisps, but his body is controlled by the Stink Spirit, a creature born of the forest\u2019s decay whose body jamming the wheels of The Wellspring was the source of it's non-functionality. Ori rends the Stink Spirit\u2019s hold on Kwolok, allowing him to kill it, but the fight leaves Kwolok mortally wounded. Before dying, Kwolok pleads with Ori to restore and protect Niwen in his place.  \n\nOri eventually finds all 5 wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Upon arriving at the Spirit Willow, Seir revives it. However, the tree informs Ori that it can no longer carry Seir and asks Ori to merge with the light to restore Niwen in its place, though this requires Ori to leave their previous life behind. The Spirit Willow passes Seir on to Ori, but Shriek arrives and snatches it. Ori battles Shriek and defeats her. Once defeated, Shriek returns to the Silent Woods to nestle under the wings of her parents\u2019 corpses. Ori limps their way to Seir and merges with it, healing Niwen and reviving Ku, restoring her damaged wing in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. \n\nNaru, Gumo, and Ku discover a new Spirit Tree growing where Ori and Seir merged. They help the tree flourish and continue their life together while the Spirit Tree watches over them. The tree reveals that it was Ori narrating all along, retelling the events leading up to the moment they merged with Seir. Eventually, the tree grows completely and the cycle begins anew as another guardian spirit falls from the tree.\n\n== Development and release ==\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"A lot of people completed ''Blind Forest'' in roughly eight hours, and thought that it was a positive experience.

He described the game as \"A hallmark of excellence,\" saying, \"There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage\". Carter particularly praised the game's visuals, combat improvements from the game's predecessor, as well as the \"dramatic chase sequences\". However, he mentioned some [[frame rate]] issues regarding the Xbox One version of the game.<ref name=\"Carter\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'}}s Michael Goroff stated positive opinions regarding the game, while pointing out the performance issues which the [[Xbox One]] edition of the game suffered from before the day-one patch was released. Goroff further mentioned that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' does everything that a good sequel is supposed to do. It refines ''The Blind Forest''{{'}}s mechanics, expands on the world, and throws in a whole bunch of new moves and concepts. But in an era that's rich with 'emotional platformers', ''Will of the Wisps'' doesn't do anything to make itself stand out. It's a fine, if not forgettable, experience\".<ref name=\"EGMreview\"/> Writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', Andrew Reiner praised the game's graphics, story and combat, subsequently calling the game better than its predecessor. Reiner said, \"The story is fantastic, the world is breathtaking, and all of that pales in comparison to the wonderfully made gameplay that soars both as a platforming and combat game. Moon Studios has outdone itself with ''Will of the Wisps'', delivering an experience that doesn't have any lulls, makes the player feel clever, and just keeps getting better as it goes.\"<ref name=\"Game Informer\"/> ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s critic, Steve Watts, gave the game a positive review, commending the combat, exploring elements, story as well as the \"Gorgeous animation and environments.\" Moreover, he highlighted occasional visual bugs as negative aspects of the game.<ref name=\"GSreview\"/> \n\nAustin Wood, reviewer for ''[[GamesRadar+]]'', acclaimed the game and its \"breathtaking music,\" world and its platforming. Wood stated that \"There are a few minor stumbles here and there, but make no mistake: I ''adore'' ''Ori and The Will of the Wisps''. It's one of the best platformers ever made, and it's an easy front-runner for game of the year. If you liked the first game, you will love this one. And if you haven't experienced Ori's story, you owe it to yourself to dive in now, especially with both games now on Xbox Game Pass. I'll be replaying this game, listening to its soundtrack, and reminiscing over its characters for years to come.\" However, Wood acknowledged some negatives regarding a few of the game's abilities and called the final level \"slightly underwhelming\".<ref name=\"GRadarreview\"/> Brandin Tyrrel of ''[[IGN]]'' also praised the game, saying that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an excellent return to this bright and beautiful open-world platformer, with an affecting story to bolster the white-knuckle challenge.\" Tyrrell further complimented the game for staying true to the original, while at the same time adding more content than its predecessor.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s critic Tyler Wilde gave the game a favorable review, praising the platforming, boss fights and the visuals. However, Wilde mentioned some criticism regarding the fighting, saying, \"it's not much fun\".<ref name=\"PCG review\"/> \n\nWriting for ''VideoGamer'', Josh Wise acclaimed the game for its graphics, music and platforming, stating that \"In the beauty stakes and beyond, there are very few, in the rarefied realms of indie or AAA, who can challenge it\". However, Wise pointed out some negatives towards the game's plot, calling it \"thin\".<ref name=\"VGreview\"/> Tola Onanuga of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the game, saying that \"More than anything else, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an intoxicating feast for the senses. From its hauntingly beautiful visuals to its ambient, responsive music, there is so much to love about the look and feel of this long-awaited sequel.\" Onanuga acknowledged some less positive aspects of the game, calling the story \"melancholy at times\" and stating that fighting \"the more common enemies can feel a little tedious after a while\". She ended her review in a positive manner, saying, \"Peppered with devious puzzles, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisp[s]'' is an irresistible challenge.

The story picks up immediately after the events of ''Blind Forest'' with Kuro\u2019s last egg having hatched, giving birth to a baby owl named Ku whom Ori, Naru, and Gumo raise as part of their family. Ku is unable to fly because she was born with a damaged wing. Gumo affixes a feather to Kuro\u2019s damaged wing, and she and Ori fly off together, eventually taking themselves to Niwen where a storm separates them. \n\nAfter regaining consciousness from the fall, Ori searches for Ku and discovers Kwolok, a toad in Inkwater Marsh who guards Niwen\u2019s inhabitants. Kwolok informs Ori that Ku was located in the Silent Woods, the former home of the Moki turned into a desolate graveyard. However, the path to the Silent Woods is barred by polluted water. In order to progress, Ori must set the wheels of The Wellspring back into motion. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. While Ori heads to The Wellspring, Naru and Gumo realize where Ori and Ku are and depart via a raft to find them. \n\nUpon setting The Wellspring\u2019s wheels back into motion and clearing Niwen\u2019s water, Ori proceeds to enter the Silent Woods and reunites with Ku. Shortly after, they encounter Shriek, a deformed owl who was an orphan since birth and rejected by the rest of her kind. Shriek attacks the pair and kills Ku. \n\nAfter Ori mourns for Ku, Kwolok explains that the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and can't help Ku in it's curent state. When the Spirit Willow died, the light of its power was shattered into five wisps that scattered across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed the Willow\u2019s guardian spirits and Shriek\u2019s parents before her birth. With the goal of restoring Niwen, Kwolok tasks Ori with finding the remaining four wisps of the Spirit Willow\u2019s light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength, and Heart of the Forest to reform the Willow's light. \n\nKwolok leaves Inkwater Marsh to help Ori find one of the wisps, but his body is controlled by the Stink Spirit, a creature born of the forest\u2019s decay whose body jamming the wheels of The Wellspring was the source of it's non-functionality. Ori rends the Stink Spirit\u2019s hold on Kwolok, allowing him to kill it, but the fight leaves Kwolok mortally wounded. Before dying, Kwolok pleads with Ori to restore and protect Niwen in his place.  \n\nOri eventually finds all 5 wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Upon arriving at the Spirit Willow, Seir revives it. However, the tree informs Ori that it can no longer carry Seir and asks Ori to merge with the light to restore Niwen in its place, though this requires Ori to leave their previous life behind. The Spirit Willow passes Seir on to Ori, but Shriek arrives and snatches it. Ori battles Shriek and defeats her. Once defeated, Shriek returns to the Silent Woods to nestle under the wings of her parents\u2019 corpses. Ori limps their way to Seir and merges with it, healing Niwen and reviving Ku, restoring her damaged wing in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. \n\nNaru, Gumo, and Ku discover a new Spirit Tree growing where Ori and Seir merged. They help the tree flourish and continue their life together while the Spirit Tree watches over them. The tree reveals that it was Ori narrating all along, retelling the events leading up to the moment they merged with Seir. Eventually, the tree grows completely and the cycle begins anew as another guardian spirit falls from the tree.\n\n== Development and release ==\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"A lot of people completed ''Blind Forest'' in roughly eight hours, and thought that it was a positive experience.

It's one of the best platformers ever made, and it's an easy front-runner for game of the year. If you liked the first game, you will love this one. And if you haven't experienced Ori's story, you owe it to yourself to dive in now, especially with both games now on Xbox Game Pass. I'll be replaying this game, listening to its soundtrack, and reminiscing over its characters for years to come.\" However, Wood acknowledged some negatives regarding a few of the game's abilities and called the final level \"slightly underwhelming\".<ref name=\"GRadarreview\"/> Brandin Tyrrel of ''[[IGN]]'' also praised the game, saying that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an excellent return to this bright and beautiful open-world platformer, with an affecting story to bolster the white-knuckle challenge.\" Tyrrell further complimented the game for staying true to the original, while at the same time adding more content than its predecessor.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s critic Tyler Wilde gave the game a favorable review, praising the platforming, boss fights and the visuals. However, Wilde mentioned some criticism regarding the fighting, saying, \"it's not much fun\".<ref name=\"PCG review\"/> \n\nWriting for ''VideoGamer'', Josh Wise acclaimed the game for its graphics, music and platforming, stating that \"In the beauty stakes and beyond, there are very few, in the rarefied realms of indie or AAA, who can challenge it\". However, Wise pointed out some negatives towards the game's plot, calling it \"thin\".<ref name=\"VGreview\"/> Tola Onanuga of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the game, saying that \"More than anything else, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an intoxicating feast for the senses. From its hauntingly beautiful visuals to its ambient, responsive music, there is so much to love about the look and feel of this long-awaited sequel.\" Onanuga acknowledged some less positive aspects of the game, calling the story \"melancholy at times\" and stating that fighting \"the more common enemies can feel a little tedious after a while\". She ended her review in a positive manner, saying, \"Peppered with devious puzzles, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisp[s]'' is an irresistible challenge.
