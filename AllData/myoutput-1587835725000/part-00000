It operates as a public-private partnership and a UK registered charity headquartered in Edinburgh.\n \nGALVmed's vision is transformational improvement in the wellbeing and economic progression of smallholder livestock farmers. While the mission is to contribute to the transformation of smallholder farmers\u2019 lives by: \n* understanding the constraints to animal health and how to overcome them; \n* engaging the animal health industry; and\u00a0 \n* ensuring awareness, availability and adoption of effective animal health interventions. \n \n\nThe intended beneficiaries of GALVmed's work are many of the 900 million people worldwide who rely on livestock for their livelihoods.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moredun|title= Visit Bill Gates discuss progress development livestock vaccines|url= http://www.moredun.org.uk/news/visit-bill-gates-discuss-progress-development-livestock-vaccines}}</ref>\n\nGALVmed's purpose is \"protecting livestock, improving human lives\" and its mission is to make a real difference to the livelihoods of resource poor farmers by providing animal health tools within a sustainable economic framework.<ref>{{cite web|last=Charity Commission|title=Register of Charities|url=\thttp://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1115606&SubsidiaryNumber=0}}</ref>\n\nGALVmed achieves its aims by: catalysing interactions with and between others as well as facilitating, supporting and forming partnerships (e.g. veterinarians, governments, policy makers, NGOs) and employing consultants.\n\n==History==\nOriginally GALVmed was known as the Global Alliance for Livestock Vaccines (GALV). GALV was founded in 2004. \nEarlier, in the early 2000s,scoping work under the DFID Animal Health Programme (AHP),<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Animal Health Programme|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50007/}}</ref> identified the need for an organisation to promote the creation of a consortium to invest in research to produce livestock vaccines, diagnostics and other products for the control of tropical livestock diseases, which the private pharmaceutical sector was not  funding at the time. \nAs a result, the AHP went on to facilitate the establishment of GALV with an appropriate legal and institutional framework and its first business plan. It was envisaged that GALV would work in a similar way to the [[GAVI Alliance]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Web Archives|title=Archives|url=http://www.dfid-ahp.org.uk/downloads/Ann_Rep_2004-5_-_FINAL.pdf|archive-date=October 19, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019235440/http://www.dfid-ahp.org.uk/downloads/Ann_Rep_2004-5_-_FINAL.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> a similar organisation but with a human health agenda.\n\nThe inception phase of GALV ran from October 2004 to March 2005. It was funded through a \u00a3300,000 grant from [[DFID]] with the objective of establishing a global public-private partnership to develop new vaccines against diseases that inflict the livestock of poor people.<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed)|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50092/Default.aspx}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the brief inception phase, DFID provided GALV (later GALVmed) with core and project funding totalling UK\u00a35.6 million during the period April 2005 to November 2011. Of this total, \u00a33 million was joint funding in partnership with the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] (BMGF)for phase 1 of what is now known as the Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed). This change of name reflected the recognition by GALV/GALVmed's management and board that although vaccines were important, the development of other types of veterinary medicines, including drugs, would also be relevant in some cases. Together DFID and BMGF provided a total of \u00a320 million for phase 1, which was scheduled to run from September 2008 until August 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed)|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50092/Default.aspx}}</ref>\n\nThroughout GALVmed phase 1, the organisation had as its mission statement and strapline \"protecting livestock, saving human life\" (PLSHL).Known as the PLSHL project, protecting livestock reflected the predominant focus on preventive veterinary medicines, especially vaccines, while saving human life indicated that two of the four key diseases GALVmed was targeting were [[zoonotic]]. The stated goal for phase 1 was to improve the health of livestock and increase food security and human health of poor livestock keepers in low-income countries.<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed)|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50092/Default.aspx}}</ref> \nDuring phase 1, GALVmed focused on four key diseases: [[East Coast fever]] (ECF) that affects cattle, [[Rift Valley fever]] (RVF)that affects cattle, sheep, goats, camels and also people, porcine cysticercosis, that affects pigs and also people, and [[Newcastle disease]], that affects poultry.\n\nFor these diseases, GALVmed and partners aimed to identify suitable mechanisms for the development of control tools (vaccines, diagnostics and pharmaceuticals) and to facilitate their access and adoption. They also aimed to develop data-driven decision making tools and to communicate, network and support advocacy and global access strategy requirements of project delivery.<br />\n \nThe PLSHL project also comprised funding to assess existing vaccines and diagnostics on a further three diseases: [[contagious caprine pleuropneumonia]] (CCPP), that is a sheep and goat disease, [[contagious bovine pleuropneumonia]](CBPP), that is a cattle disease and [[peste des petits ruminants]] (PPR), which is sheep and goat disease. In addition, exploratory activities were undertaken on [[African swine fever]].\n\nBy the end of phase 1, DFID reported that GALVmed and partners had made four vaccines available to poor livestock keepers. Two vaccines, one for the tick-borne cattle disease ECF and one emergency vaccine for the cattle, sheep and goat disease RVF, were reported to be already in wide use in Africa.\n\nPhase 2 followed with another joint funding of US$51 million from BMGF (80 percent) and DFID (20 percent). It ran from 2012 to 2017. In commenting on the awarding of the phase 2 grant, the UK International Development Secretary, Andrew Mitchell, explained that, \u201cGALVmed has pioneered work to identify vaccines, medicine and early diagnostic solutions to tackle some of the most devastating livestock diseases that affect poor farmers in the developing world. This new funding from the British taxpayer and from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will ensure that these innovative solutions are produced at scale and that solutions can get to those who need them most, at an affordable price.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|title= Gates Foundation and the UK Government award GALVmed additional US$ 51 million|url= http://www.galvmed.org/gates-foundation-and-dfid-award-galvmed-additional-us-51-million}}</ref>\n \nIn view of the progress made during GALVmed phase 1 and 2, BMGF and DFID decided to jointly fund a new programme, Veterinary Innovations Transforming Animal Health and Livelihoods (VITAL) which will run from 2018 to 2022. The VITAL programme aims to make a significant contribution towards transformational change in the smallholder livestock health landscape by developing a portfolio of high impact products and initiating a range of private sector market initiatives operating at scale in the smallholder sector. For the VITAL programme, DFID and BMGF jointly committed to providing US$50 million with DFID contributing 20 percent and BMGF 80 percent.<ref>{{cite web|last=Charity Commission|title= Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed)|url= http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/SIR/ENDS06/0001115606_SIR_20130331_E.PDF}}</ref>\n\nIn awarding the VITAL funding, Bill Gates, who is the co-Chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said that \"for over a billion people living in the world\u2019s poorest countries, agriculture and livestock are a lifeline out of poverty. The science and research being led by the great minds here in Edinburgh are making huge strides in improving the health and productivity of livestock. With this investment in GALVmed, we can take advantage of the UK\u2019s leading R&D capabilities to fight the spread of livestock diseases, both protecting animals in the developing world and here in the UK. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s investment of $40 million dollars will help GALVmed make vaccines, medicines and diagnostics accessible to millions of the world\u2019s poorest smallholder farmers.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.galvmed.org/news/bill-gates-visits-edinburgh-showcase-british-excellence-research-development-announces-new-40-million-investment-galvmed-boost-british-livestock-research-worlds-poore/|title=Bill Gates visits Edinburgh to showcase British excellence in research and development and Announces new $40 million investment in GALVmed to boost British livestock research for world\u2019s poorest people|website=GALVmed|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-27}}\n</ref> \n\nWhile the focus for GALVmed phase 1 and 2 was targeting specific diseases such Newcastle disease, RVF, CBPP, ECF and CCPP affecting poor smallholder farmers in Africa and south Asia, the VITAL programme focuses on delivering a portfolio of animal health products to smallholder farmers. The broad objectives of the VITAL project are (1) Developing six new high impact livestock vaccines, ready for commercial production and suitable for widespread use by smallholders in Africa and South Asia in the control of major livestock diseases.

Other partners included the African Union Panafrican Veterinary Vaccine Centre (AU-PANVAC) and the centre de coop\u00e9ration internationale enrechercheagronomique pour le d\u00e9veloppement (CIRAD).\n \nGALVmed led the implementation of a VACNADA component to improve the capacity of eight African laboratories to make quality assured vaccines in more efficient ways that met internationally recognised quality standards and best practices. Staff from selected national vaccine producing laboratories, identified through a needs assessment, received training in laboratory and vaccine operation management, had their laboratory facilities upgraded and technical support provided for the implementation of quality assurance and standardisation of the production process of selected vaccines.<ref>{{cite web|last=AU-IBAR|title= Current Programmes and Projects|url= http://au-ibar.org/library/publications/57-en/programmes-and-projects/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=99&Itemid=445}}</ref><br />\n \nIn 2011, DFID awarded GALVmed an additional grant worth \u00a38,010,708 to support the development of an integrated package of tools and policies and implement it as a cost-effective control of animal African trypanosomosis (AAT). The objective was to develop a new robust field diagnostic tool for AAT, new trypanocidal drugs and to establish the basis for the development of a vaccine for AAT.  The Controlling AAT project was scheduled to run until February 2014,.<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Controlling African Animal Trypanosomosis (AAT)|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/60796/Default.aspx}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Controlling African Animal Trypanosomosis (AAT)|url= http://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/projects/GB-1-202040/}}</ref><br />\n \nThe DFID funding for AAT was subsequently complemented by a grant worth US$1,421,722 awarded by BMGF in January 2014 to undergo Phase 2 of the project. The stated purpose of the BMGF grant was to develop safe and effective drugs against drug-resistant AAT as well as a diagnostic test for field diagnosis of infection in cattle and to improve the quality control of existing trypanocidal drugs used by smallholder livestock keepers in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|title= How We Work|url= http://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/Quick-Links/Grants-Database/Grants/2014/01/OPP1100291}}</ref>\n\nGALVmed is also part of the consortium awarded US$1.8 million by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia BEN-1 Vaccine Evaluation project. The project is exploring the potential efficacy of a vaccine to combat [[contagious bovine pleuropneumonia]] which is a major constraint to cattle production in many areas of sub-Saharan Africa where 18 countries are reported to be affected by this disease.<ref>{{cite web|last=CAAS|title= HVRI to lead the Bill & Melinda Gates project on Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia BEN-1 Vaccine Evaluation|url= http://www.caas.cn/en/newsroom/international_cooperation_update/235999.shtml}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, GALVmed received funding from [https://agresults.org/ AgResults] to implement the Brucellosis Vaccine Prize Initiative,  a US$30 million global competition, which invites animal health innovators (\u2018Solvers\u2019) to submit their proposals for \u2013 and ultimately develop \u2013 a suitable vaccine that is efficacious, safe and viable for use against ''Brucella melitensis'' a pathogen causing Brucellosis that particularly affects smallholder farmers in the developing world.\n\nAnd in 2018, GALVmed partnered with Boehringer Ingelheim on the \u201cLastMile\u201d, the initiative which is funded by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This integrated, solutions-driven initiative aims to address crucial animal health challenges by creating consistent availability of animal medical resources in hard-to-reach areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. It targets ruminants, such as sheep, goats and cattle, and will further expand to include poultry. Through this project, Boehringer Ingelheim helps smallholder farmers, in Africa, access to veterinary medicines reaffirming its strong social commitment to make a difference to human and animal lives where it is needed.\n\n==Organisation==\nGALVmed is a company limited by guarantee and a registered charity in both Scotland, England and Wales.\nIts head office is located in Edinburgh, Scotland. \nGALVmed has regional offices in New Delhi and Nairobi.\nGALVmed has 31 staff members and long-term consultants in addition to advisors and contracted consultants. It has more than 200 active partnerships.\nGALVmed is governed by a board made up of 11 trustees, recruited for their individual skills and experiences. The board provides strategic oversight and is in turn overseen by Members who are drawn from a wide range of public bodies, private institutions including pharmaceutical companies, and non-governmental organisations.<ref>{{cite web|last=GALVmed|title= About GALVmed|url= http://www.galvmed.org/about-galvmed/}}</ref>\nCurrent Chief Executive of GALVmed is [https://www.galvmed.org/people/carolin-schumacher/ Dr Carolin Schumacher].\n\n==Focus of work==\nUnder PLHS 1 and 2, GALVmed is supported activities in 15 African countries and also India and Nepal. In addition, product development activities were undertaken in Europe, Asia, North & Latin America and Australia.\n\nduring these phases, GALVmed worked on 12 viral, bacterial and protozoal diseases that affect cattle, sheep and goats, pigs and poultry, some of which are zoonotic. The 12 diseases are:\n\n'''Cattle diseases''':\n* East Coast fever (Theileriosis)\n* Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia\n* Trypanosomosis\n* [[Lumpy skin disease]]\n\n'''Sheep and goats diseases''':\n* Peste des petits ruminants\n* Contagious caprinepleuropneumonia\n* Sheep & goat pox\n* [[Brucellosis]]\n\n'''Pigs diseases''':\n* Porcine cysticercosis (zoonotic)\n* African swine fever\n\n'''Poultry diseases''':\n* Newcastle disease\n\n'''Multi-species diseases''':\n* Rift Valley fever (zoonotic)\n\nTwenty different veterinary products were also actively worked upon at various stages in the exploratory-proof of concept-development-registration-commercialization continuum: 11 vaccines, 4 pharmaceutical and 2 diagnostic products.\n\nUnder the '''VITAL programme''', GALVmed is undertaking two complimentary strands of work, Product Development and Market Development. \n\nThe '''Product Development''' projects include:\n* Small ruminant systemic multivalent vaccine\n* Small ruminant reproductive multivalent vaccine\n* PPR-SGP Combination vaccine\n* CBPP-LSD RVF combination vaccine\n* ND-Gumboro combination vaccine\n* Negatively marked PPR vaccine\n* ND-FP concurrent use vaccine field studies\n* Product Registration Expansion\n* ASF vaccine\n* Animal African Trypanosomosis\n* High Release Titre ND vaccine \n\n'''Market Development''' activities include:\n* Asia initiative \u2013 a manufacturer driven & led enterprise\n* East Africa initiative \u2013 multi manufacturer\n* West Africa initiative \u2013 multi manufacturer\n* West Africa \u2013 a manufacturer-distributor driven & managed entreprise\n* West Africa \u2013 upstream enterprise \n* Sensitisation of R&D products\n* Last Mile project with Boehringer Ingelheim\n\n==Key projects==\n'''Newcastle disease''': One of GALVmed's projects has focused on the prevention of Newcastle disease in the chickens kept by poor women in Nepal. \nGALVmed, in partnership with the NGO Heifer International Nepal, has established a vaccine supply system that has transformed backyard poultry keeping. Whereas previously these women regularly lost 90 percent of their small flocks to the disease, now, thanks to vaccination, they have built up profitable small-scale enterprises. These have not only enabled them to pay their children's school fees and meet medical bills, but have also empowered the women who report that they now enjoy more respect from their husbands.\n \nVaccination is carried out by trained community animal health workers who buy vaccines and offer vaccination services to the women on payment of a small fee. Following a recent assessment of the project, the BMGF concluded that, \u201cThis is possibly the easiest, quickest and most economic way of reaching out to the poor of the world with visible results in helping alleviate poverty.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last=The Times|title= Farmers take Bill Gates\u2019s \u00a325m tip: care for the animals to beat poverty|url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/scotland/article4307623.ece}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, GALVmed announced it was to bring Newcastle disease vaccination to 100,000 backyard poultry farmers in the Mayurbhanj district of Orissa, India. In partnership with [[Hester Biosciences|Hester Biosciences Limited]], GALVmed will use the thermostable Lasota vaccine for Newcastle disease. Although this vaccine needs to be transported and stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius, at village-level, it can be kept in room temperature for 10 days at 37 degrees Celsius. This means that the 237 local vaccinators will be able to stock up on the vaccine and not need to make frequent trips to the retailer for fresh stocks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Animal Pharm|title= India targeted in Newcastle disease vaccine plan|url= https://www.agra-net.net/agra/animal-pharm/regions/india/india-targeted-in-newcastle-disease-vaccine-plan-467426.htm}}</ref>\n\n'''East Coast fever:''' From the outset a major focus of GALVmed's work has been ECF. GALVmed has invested heavily in providing infrastructure and business and technical support to the Centre for Tick and Tick Borne Diseases in Lilongwe, Malawi. In December 2014, CTTBD became the African Union centre of excellence in ECF vaccine production within Africa when it began production on the Muguga Cocktail vaccine against ECF. The one-shot-for-life vaccine will help protect 25 million cattle across 11 countries. The Muguga Cocktail ECF vaccine was originally developed by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and its predecessor, the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases (ILRAD) and the Kenya Agricultural Research institute \u2013 now known as the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO).<ref>{{cite web|last=Animal Pharm|title= Africa's top ECF vaccine facility upgraded|url=https://cttbdlaunch.wordpress.com/}}</ref>\n\n==Key Achievements==\nBy the end of phase two, GALVmed reported the following key achievements<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.galvmed.org/galvmedat10/index.html|title=GALVmed @10 - A decade of protecting livestock, improving human lives|website=www.galvmed.org|access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref>\n\n* 10 products delivered \n* Proof of Concept achieved for 8 products \n* 6,000+ compounds screened, 1 potential trypanocide, several backup candidates for Trypanosomosis\n* 8 products commercialised \n* 1.67 million cattle vaccinated against ECF\n* 170 million ND vaccines sold \n* Over 2.5 million households reached \n* USD$ 167 million estimated value of livestock disease mortalities averted \n* Over 12,400 vaccinators trained\n* EAC MRP system established, 1 product registered, 2 under review\n* FARM Africa Business plan development supported resulting in successful establishment of livestock social enterprise Sidai \n* Manufacturing capability of 8 African laboratories enhanced \n\n==Key partnerships==\nPartnerships are central to GALVmed's approach; it currently has 200 active partnerships.

GALV was founded in 2004. \nEarlier, in the early 2000s,scoping work under the DFID Animal Health Programme (AHP),<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Animal Health Programme|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50007/}}</ref> identified the need for an organisation to promote the creation of a consortium to invest in research to produce livestock vaccines, diagnostics and other products for the control of tropical livestock diseases, which the private pharmaceutical sector was not  funding at the time. \nAs a result, the AHP went on to facilitate the establishment of GALV with an appropriate legal and institutional framework and its first business plan. It was envisaged that GALV would work in a similar way to the [[GAVI Alliance]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Web Archives|title=Archives|url=http://www.dfid-ahp.org.uk/downloads/Ann_Rep_2004-5_-_FINAL.pdf|archive-date=October 19, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019235440/http://www.dfid-ahp.org.uk/downloads/Ann_Rep_2004-5_-_FINAL.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> a similar organisation but with a human health agenda.\n\nThe inception phase of GALV ran from October 2004 to March 2005. It was funded through a \u00a3300,000 grant from [[DFID]] with the objective of establishing a global public-private partnership to develop new vaccines against diseases that inflict the livestock of poor people.<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed)|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50092/Default.aspx}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the brief inception phase, DFID provided GALV (later GALVmed) with core and project funding totalling UK\u00a35.6 million during the period April 2005 to November 2011. Of this total, \u00a33 million was joint funding in partnership with the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] (BMGF)for phase 1 of what is now known as the Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed). This change of name reflected the recognition by GALV/GALVmed's management and board that although vaccines were important, the development of other types of veterinary medicines, including drugs, would also be relevant in some cases. Together DFID and BMGF provided a total of \u00a320 million for phase 1, which was scheduled to run from September 2008 until August 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed)|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50092/Default.aspx}}</ref>\n\nThroughout GALVmed phase 1, the organisation had as its mission statement and strapline \"protecting livestock, saving human life\" (PLSHL).Known as the PLSHL project, protecting livestock reflected the predominant focus on preventive veterinary medicines, especially vaccines, while saving human life indicated that two of the four key diseases GALVmed was targeting were [[zoonotic]]. The stated goal for phase 1 was to improve the health of livestock and increase food security and human health of poor livestock keepers in low-income countries.<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed)|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50092/Default.aspx}}</ref> \nDuring phase 1, GALVmed focused on four key diseases: [[East Coast fever]] (ECF) that affects cattle, [[Rift Valley fever]] (RVF)that affects cattle, sheep, goats, camels and also people, porcine cysticercosis, that affects pigs and also people, and [[Newcastle disease]], that affects poultry.\n\nFor these diseases, GALVmed and partners aimed to identify suitable mechanisms for the development of control tools (vaccines, diagnostics and pharmaceuticals) and to facilitate their access and adoption. They also aimed to develop data-driven decision making tools and to communicate, network and support advocacy and global access strategy requirements of project delivery.<br />\n \nThe PLSHL project also comprised funding to assess existing vaccines and diagnostics on a further three diseases: [[contagious caprine pleuropneumonia]] (CCPP), that is a sheep and goat disease, [[contagious bovine pleuropneumonia]](CBPP), that is a cattle disease and [[peste des petits ruminants]] (PPR), which is sheep and goat disease. In addition, exploratory activities were undertaken on [[African swine fever]].\n\nBy the end of phase 1, DFID reported that GALVmed and partners had made four vaccines available to poor livestock keepers. Two vaccines, one for the tick-borne cattle disease ECF and one emergency vaccine for the cattle, sheep and goat disease RVF, were reported to be already in wide use in Africa.\n\nPhase 2 followed with another joint funding of US$51 million from BMGF (80 percent) and DFID (20 percent). It ran from 2012 to 2017. In commenting on the awarding of the phase 2 grant, the UK International Development Secretary, Andrew Mitchell, explained that, \u201cGALVmed has pioneered work to identify vaccines, medicine and early diagnostic solutions to tackle some of the most devastating livestock diseases that affect poor farmers in the developing world. This new funding from the British taxpayer and from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will ensure that these innovative solutions are produced at scale and that solutions can get to those who need them most, at an affordable price.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|title= Gates Foundation and the UK Government award GALVmed additional US$ 51 million|url= http://www.galvmed.org/gates-foundation-and-dfid-award-galvmed-additional-us-51-million}}</ref>\n \nIn view of the progress made during GALVmed phase 1 and 2, BMGF and DFID decided to jointly fund a new programme, Veterinary Innovations Transforming Animal Health and Livelihoods (VITAL) which will run from 2018 to 2022. The VITAL programme aims to make a significant contribution towards transformational change in the smallholder livestock health landscape by developing a portfolio of high impact products and initiating a range of private sector market initiatives operating at scale in the smallholder sector. For the VITAL programme, DFID and BMGF jointly committed to providing US$50 million with DFID contributing 20 percent and BMGF 80 percent.<ref>{{cite web|last=Charity Commission|title= Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed)|url= http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/SIR/ENDS06/0001115606_SIR_20130331_E.PDF}}</ref>\n\nIn awarding the VITAL funding, Bill Gates, who is the co-Chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said that \"for over a billion people living in the world\u2019s poorest countries, agriculture and livestock are a lifeline out of poverty. The science and research being led by the great minds here in Edinburgh are making huge strides in improving the health and productivity of livestock. With this investment in GALVmed, we can take advantage of the UK\u2019s leading R&D capabilities to fight the spread of livestock diseases, both protecting animals in the developing world and here in the UK. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s investment of $40 million dollars will help GALVmed make vaccines, medicines and diagnostics accessible to millions of the world\u2019s poorest smallholder farmers.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.galvmed.org/news/bill-gates-visits-edinburgh-showcase-british-excellence-research-development-announces-new-40-million-investment-galvmed-boost-british-livestock-research-worlds-poore/|title=Bill Gates visits Edinburgh to showcase British excellence in research and development and Announces new $40 million investment in GALVmed to boost British livestock research for world\u2019s poorest people|website=GALVmed|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-27}}\n</ref> \n\nWhile the focus for GALVmed phase 1 and 2 was targeting specific diseases such Newcastle disease, RVF, CBPP, ECF and CCPP affecting poor smallholder farmers in Africa and south Asia, the VITAL programme focuses on delivering a portfolio of animal health products to smallholder farmers. The broad objectives of the VITAL project are (1) Developing six new high impact livestock vaccines, ready for commercial production and suitable for widespread use by smallholders in Africa and South Asia in the control of major livestock diseases. (2)Partnering the animal health industry in establishing five large scale portfolio distribution networks in Africa and Asia.

Other partners included the African Union Panafrican Veterinary Vaccine Centre (AU-PANVAC) and the centre de coop\u00e9ration internationale enrechercheagronomique pour le d\u00e9veloppement (CIRAD).\n \nGALVmed led the implementation of a VACNADA component to improve the capacity of eight African laboratories to make quality assured vaccines in more efficient ways that met internationally recognised quality standards and best practices. Staff from selected national vaccine producing laboratories, identified through a needs assessment, received training in laboratory and vaccine operation management, had their laboratory facilities upgraded and technical support provided for the implementation of quality assurance and standardisation of the production process of selected vaccines.<ref>{{cite web|last=AU-IBAR|title= Current Programmes and Projects|url= http://au-ibar.org/library/publications/57-en/programmes-and-projects/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=99&Itemid=445}}</ref><br />\n \nIn 2011, DFID awarded GALVmed an additional grant worth \u00a38,010,708 to support the development of an integrated package of tools and policies and implement it as a cost-effective control of animal African trypanosomosis (AAT). The objective was to develop a new robust field diagnostic tool for AAT, new trypanocidal drugs and to establish the basis for the development of a vaccine for AAT.  The Controlling AAT project was scheduled to run until February 2014,.<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Controlling African Animal Trypanosomosis (AAT)|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/60796/Default.aspx}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Controlling African Animal Trypanosomosis (AAT)|url= http://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/projects/GB-1-202040/}}</ref><br />\n \nThe DFID funding for AAT was subsequently complemented by a grant worth US$1,421,722 awarded by BMGF in January 2014 to undergo Phase 2 of the project. The stated purpose of the BMGF grant was to develop safe and effective drugs against drug-resistant AAT as well as a diagnostic test for field diagnosis of infection in cattle and to improve the quality control of existing trypanocidal drugs used by smallholder livestock keepers in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|title= How We Work|url= http://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/Quick-Links/Grants-Database/Grants/2014/01/OPP1100291}}</ref>\n\nGALVmed is also part of the consortium awarded US$1.8 million by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia BEN-1 Vaccine Evaluation project. The project is exploring the potential efficacy of a vaccine to combat [[contagious bovine pleuropneumonia]] which is a major constraint to cattle production in many areas of sub-Saharan Africa where 18 countries are reported to be affected by this disease.<ref>{{cite web|last=CAAS|title= HVRI to lead the Bill & Melinda Gates project on Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia BEN-1 Vaccine Evaluation|url= http://www.caas.cn/en/newsroom/international_cooperation_update/235999.shtml}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, GALVmed received funding from [https://agresults.org/ AgResults] to implement the Brucellosis Vaccine Prize Initiative,  a US$30 million global competition, which invites animal health innovators (\u2018Solvers\u2019) to submit their proposals for \u2013 and ultimately develop \u2013 a suitable vaccine that is efficacious, safe and viable for use against ''Brucella melitensis'' a pathogen causing Brucellosis that particularly affects smallholder farmers in the developing world.\n\nAnd in 2018, GALVmed partnered with Boehringer Ingelheim on the \u201cLastMile\u201d, the initiative which is funded by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This integrated, solutions-driven initiative aims to address crucial animal health challenges by creating consistent availability of animal medical resources in hard-to-reach areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. It targets ruminants, such as sheep, goats and cattle, and will further expand to include poultry. Through this project, Boehringer Ingelheim helps smallholder farmers, in Africa, access to veterinary medicines reaffirming its strong social commitment to make a difference to human and animal lives where it is needed.\n\n==Organisation==\nGALVmed is a company limited by guarantee and a registered charity in both Scotland, England and Wales.\nIts head office is located in Edinburgh, Scotland. \nGALVmed has regional offices in New Delhi and Nairobi.\nGALVmed has 31 staff members and long-term consultants in addition to advisors and contracted consultants. It has more than 200 active partnerships.\nGALVmed is governed by a board made up of 11 trustees, recruited for their individual skills and experiences. The board provides strategic oversight and is in turn overseen by Members who are drawn from a wide range of public bodies, private institutions including pharmaceutical companies, and non-governmental organisations.<ref>{{cite web|last=GALVmed|title= About GALVmed|url= http://www.galvmed.org/about-galvmed/}}</ref>\nCurrent Chief Executive of GALVmed is [https://www.galvmed.org/people/carolin-schumacher/ Dr Carolin Schumacher].\n\n==Focus of work==\nUnder PLHS 1 and 2, GALVmed is supported activities in 15 African countries and also India and Nepal. In addition, product development activities were undertaken in Europe, Asia, North & Latin America and Australia.\n\nduring these phases, GALVmed worked on 12 viral, bacterial and protozoal diseases that affect cattle, sheep and goats, pigs and poultry, some of which are zoonotic. The 12 diseases are:\n\n'''Cattle diseases''':\n* East Coast fever (Theileriosis)\n* Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia\n* Trypanosomosis\n* [[Lumpy skin disease]]\n\n'''Sheep and goats diseases''':\n* Peste des petits ruminants\n* Contagious caprinepleuropneumonia\n* Sheep & goat pox\n* [[Brucellosis]]\n\n'''Pigs diseases''':\n* Porcine cysticercosis (zoonotic)\n* African swine fever\n\n'''Poultry diseases''':\n* Newcastle disease\n\n'''Multi-species diseases''':\n* Rift Valley fever (zoonotic)\n\nTwenty different veterinary products were also actively worked upon at various stages in the exploratory-proof of concept-development-registration-commercialization continuum: 11 vaccines, 4 pharmaceutical and 2 diagnostic products.\n\nUnder the '''VITAL programme''', GALVmed is undertaking two complimentary strands of work, Product Development and Market Development. \n\nThe '''Product Development''' projects include:\n* Small ruminant systemic multivalent vaccine\n* Small ruminant reproductive multivalent vaccine\n* PPR-SGP Combination vaccine\n* CBPP-LSD RVF combination vaccine\n* ND-Gumboro combination vaccine\n* Negatively marked PPR vaccine\n* ND-FP concurrent use vaccine field studies\n* Product Registration Expansion\n* ASF vaccine\n* Animal African Trypanosomosis\n* High Release Titre ND vaccine \n\n'''Market Development''' activities include:\n* Asia initiative \u2013 a manufacturer driven & led enterprise\n* East Africa initiative \u2013 multi manufacturer\n* West Africa initiative \u2013 multi manufacturer\n* West Africa \u2013 a manufacturer-distributor driven & managed entreprise\n* West Africa \u2013 upstream enterprise \n* Sensitisation of R&D products\n* Last Mile project with Boehringer Ingelheim\n\n==Key projects==\n'''Newcastle disease''': One of GALVmed's projects has focused on the prevention of Newcastle disease in the chickens kept by poor women in Nepal. \nGALVmed, in partnership with the NGO Heifer International Nepal, has established a vaccine supply system that has transformed backyard poultry keeping. Whereas previously these women regularly lost 90 percent of their small flocks to the disease, now, thanks to vaccination, they have built up profitable small-scale enterprises. These have not only enabled them to pay their children's school fees and meet medical bills, but have also empowered the women who report that they now enjoy more respect from their husbands.\n \nVaccination is carried out by trained community animal health workers who buy vaccines and offer vaccination services to the women on payment of a small fee. Following a recent assessment of the project, the BMGF concluded that, \u201cThis is possibly the easiest, quickest and most economic way of reaching out to the poor of the world with visible results in helping alleviate poverty.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last=The Times|title= Farmers take Bill Gates\u2019s \u00a325m tip: care for the animals to beat poverty|url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/scotland/article4307623.ece}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, GALVmed announced it was to bring Newcastle disease vaccination to 100,000 backyard poultry farmers in the Mayurbhanj district of Orissa, India. In partnership with [[Hester Biosciences|Hester Biosciences Limited]], GALVmed will use the thermostable Lasota vaccine for Newcastle disease. Although this vaccine needs to be transported and stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius, at village-level, it can be kept in room temperature for 10 days at 37 degrees Celsius. This means that the 237 local vaccinators will be able to stock up on the vaccine and not need to make frequent trips to the retailer for fresh stocks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Animal Pharm|title= India targeted in Newcastle disease vaccine plan|url= https://www.agra-net.net/agra/animal-pharm/regions/india/india-targeted-in-newcastle-disease-vaccine-plan-467426.htm}}</ref>\n\n'''East Coast fever:''' From the outset a major focus of GALVmed's work has been ECF. GALVmed has invested heavily in providing infrastructure and business and technical support to the Centre for Tick and Tick Borne Diseases in Lilongwe, Malawi. In December 2014, CTTBD became the African Union centre of excellence in ECF vaccine production within Africa when it began production on the Muguga Cocktail vaccine against ECF. The one-shot-for-life vaccine will help protect 25 million cattle across 11 countries. The Muguga Cocktail ECF vaccine was originally developed by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and its predecessor, the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases (ILRAD) and the Kenya Agricultural Research institute \u2013 now known as the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO).<ref>{{cite web|last=Animal Pharm|title= Africa's top ECF vaccine facility upgraded|url=https://cttbdlaunch.wordpress.com/}}</ref>\n\n==Key Achievements==\nBy the end of phase two, GALVmed reported the following key achievements<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.galvmed.org/galvmedat10/index.html|title=GALVmed @10 - A decade of protecting livestock, improving human lives|website=www.galvmed.org|access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref>\n\n* 10 products delivered \n* Proof of Concept achieved for 8 products \n* 6,000+ compounds screened, 1 potential trypanocide, several backup candidates for Trypanosomosis\n* 8 products commercialised \n* 1.67 million cattle vaccinated against ECF\n* 170 million ND vaccines sold \n* Over 2.5 million households reached \n* USD$ 167 million estimated value of livestock disease mortalities averted \n* Over 12,400 vaccinators trained\n* EAC MRP system established, 1 product registered, 2 under review\n* FARM Africa Business plan development supported resulting in successful establishment of livestock social enterprise Sidai \n* Manufacturing capability of 8 African laboratories enhanced \n\n==Key partnerships==\nPartnerships are central to GALVmed's approach; it currently has 200 active partnerships.
