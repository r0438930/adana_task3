The period between the initial infection when the dog is bitten by a mosquito and the maturation of the worms into adults living in the pulmonary arteries takes six to seven months in dogs and is known as the \"prepatent period\".\n\nThe first larval stage (L<sub>1</sub>) and second larval stage (L<sub>2</sub>) of heartworm development occurs within the body of a mosquito. Once the larvae develop into the infective third larval stage (L<sub>3</sub>), the mosquito locates and bites a host, depositing the larvae under the skin at the site of the bite. After a week or two of further growth, they molt into the fourth larval stage (L<sub>4</sub>) . Then, they migrate to the [[muscle]]s of the [[chest]] and [[abdomen]], and 45 to 60 days after infection, molt to the fifth stage (L<sub>5</sub>, immature adult). Between 75 and 120 days after infection, these immature heartworms then enter the bloodstream and are carried through the heart to reside in the pulmonary artery.  Over the next three to four months, they increase greatly in size.

Rarely, migrating heartworm larvae get \"lost\" and end up in aberrant sites, such as the eye, brain, or an artery in the leg, which results in unusual symptoms such as blindness, [[seizures]], and [[lameness]], but normally, until the larvae mature and congregate inside the heart, they produce no symptoms or signs of illness.\n\nMany dogs show little or no sign of infection even after the worms become adults. These animals usually have only a light infection and live a fairly sedentary lifestyle. However, active dogs and those with heavier infections may show the classic signs of heartworm disease. Early signs include a cough, especially during or after exercise, and exercise intolerance. In the most advanced cases where many adult worms have built up in the heart without treatment, signs progress to severe weight loss, [[fainting]], coughing up blood, and finally, congestive heart failure.\n\n==Role of ''Wolbachia pipientis''==\n''[[Wolbachia pipientis]]'' is an intracellular [[bacterium]] that is an [[endosymbiont]] of ''D. immitis''.  All heartworms are thought to be infected with ''[[Wolbachia]]'' to some degree.  The inflammation occurring at the die-off of adult heartworms or larvae is in part due to the release of ''Wolbachia'' bacteria or protein into the tissues.  This may be particularly significant in cats, in which the disease seems to be more related to larval death than living adult heartworms.  Treating heartworm-positive animals with an antibiotic such as [[doxycycline]] to remove ''Wolbachia'' may prove to be beneficial, but further studies are necessary.<ref name=forum>{{Cite journal| last = Todd-Jenkins | first = Karen | title = The Role of ''Wolbachia'' in heartworm disease | journal = Veterinary Forum | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 28&ndash;30 |date=October 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis in dogs==\n[[File:Microfilaria of Dirofilaria immitis (Heartworms) Surrounded by Neoplastic Lymphocytes 1.jpg|thumb|Microfilaria of ''Dirofilaria immitis'' (heartworms) in a lymph node of a dog with lymphoma.

The accuracy of these tests, typically used for routine screening or diagnosis of heartworm infection, is improved by multiple testing. The modified Knott test and millipore filtration are more sensitive because they concentrate microfilariae, improving the chance of diagnosis.<ref name=\"Ettinger_2010\"/> The direct smear technique allows examination of larval motion, helping in the distinction of ''D. immitis'' from ''Acanthocheilonema reconditum''. This distinction is important because the presence of the latter parasite does not require expensive and potentially harmful therapy. The potential for a microfilaremic infection is 5 - 67%. The number of circulating microfilariae does not correlate with the number of adult heartworms, so is not an indicator of disease severity.<ref name=\"Ettinger_2010\"/>\n\n'''Antigen testing''', in most practices, has supplanted or supplemented microfilarial detection. Combining the microfilaria and adult antigen test is most useful in dogs receiving [[diethylcarbamazine]] or no preventive ([[macrolides]] like [[ivermectin]] or [[moxidectin]] typically render the dog amicrofilaremic). Up to 1% of infected dogs are microfilaria-positive and antigen-negative.<ref name=\"Ettinger_2010\"/>'''[[Immunodiagnostics]]''' ([[ELISA]], [[Lateral flow test|lateral flow immunoassay]], rapid immunomigration techniques) to detect heartworm antigen in the host's blood are now regularly used. They can detect occult infections, or infections without the presence of circulating microfilariae. However, these tests are limited in that they only detect the antigens released from the sexually mature female worm's [[reproductive tract]]. Therefore,  false-negative results may occur during the first five to eight months of infection when the worms are not yet sexually mature.<ref name=\"Ettinger_2010\"/> The [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of these tests is close to 100%, and the sensitivity is more than 80%.<ref>{{cite web| last = Atkins | first = Clarke | title = Heartworm Disease in Dogs: An Update | work = Proceedings of the 30th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2005 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2005&PID=10900&O=Generic | accessdate = 2007-02-26 }}</ref> A recent study demonstrated a sensitivity of only 64% for infections of only one female worm, but improved with increasing female worm burden (85%, 88%, and 89% for two, three, and four female worms, respectively).

Typically, the changes observed are enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, the right side of the heart, and the pulmonary arteries in the lobes of the lung. Inflammation of the lung tissue is also often observed.<ref>{{cite web|title=American Heaartworm Society|url=http://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/canine-heartworm.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131104095619/http://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/canine-heartworm.htm|archivedate=2013-11-04}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment in dogs==\nIf an animal is diagnosed with heartworms, treatment may be indicated. Before the worms can be treated, however, the dog's heart, liver, and kidney function must be evaluated to determine the risks of treatment. Usually, the adult worms are killed with an [[arsenic]]-based compound. The currently approved drug in the US, [[melarsomine]], is marketed under the brand name Immiticide.<ref>{{cite web| title = Product Information| url = http://ph.merial.com/pet_owners/dogs/product_immiticide.asp| accessdate = 2008-07-01| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080828103952/http://ph.merial.com/pet_owners/dogs/product_immiticide.asp| archivedate = 2008-08-28}}</ref> It has a greater efficacy and fewer side effects than the previously used drug [[thiacetarsamide]], sold as Caparsolate, which makes it a safer alternative for dogs with late-stage infections.\n\nAfter treatment, the dog must rest, and exercise is to be heavily reduced for several weeks so as to give its body sufficient time to absorb the dead worms without ill effect. Otherwise, if the dog is under exertion, dead worms may break loose and travel to the lungs, potentially causing [[respiratory failure]] and sudden death. According to the American Heartworm Society, the administering of [[aspirin]] to dogs infected with heartworms is no longer recommended due to a lack of evidence of clinical benefit, and aspirin may be contraindicated in several cases.  Aspirin had previously been recommended for its effects on platelet adhesion and the reduction of vascular damage caused by the heartworms.\n\nThe course of treatment is not completed until several weeks later, when the microfilariae are dealt with in a separate course of treatment. Once heartworm tests are negative and no surviving worm is detected, the treatment is considered a success, and the patient is effectively cured.\n\nSurgical removal of the adult heartworms as a form of treatment may also be indicated, especially in advanced cases with substantial heart involvement and damage.<ref>{{cite web|title=2005 Guidelines For the Diagnosis, Prevention and Management of Heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) Infection in Dogs |work=American Heartworm Society |year=2005 |url=http://www.heartwormsociety.org/article.asp?id=48 |accessdate=2008-07-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616144710/http://www.heartwormsociety.org/article.asp?id=48 |archivedate=2008-06-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nLong-term monthly administration of [[ivermectin]] year-round at three times the dose normally used for heartworm [[Heartworm#Prevention|prevention]] eventually kills adult heartworms. However, this is not the treatment of choice for removal of adult heartworms for two reasons. Firstly, this treatment is not as effective as melarsomine. More importantly, adult heartworms do not begin to die until 18 months of treatment have elapsed, which is not acceptable for dogs with high-volume infections, and the worms cause irreversible damage to the heart and lungs during that time.  Long-term treatment over a year with doxycycline daily and Heartgard Plus has been shown to be effective in early heartworm patients which are asymptomatic.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Prevention of infection in dogs==\nPrevention of heartworm infection can be obtained through a number of veterinary drugs. The drugs approved for use in the US are ivermectin (sold under the brand names [[Heartgard]], [[Iverhart]], and several other generic versions), [[milbemycin]] (Interceptor Flavor Tabs and [[Sentinel Flavor Tabs]]) and [[moxidectin]] (ProHeart) administered as pills or chewable tablets. Moxidectin is also available in both a six-month and 12-month, sustained-release injection, [[ProHeart 6]] or [[ProHeart 12]], administered by veterinarians.  The injectable form of moxidectin was taken off the market in the United States due to safety concerns in 2004, but the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] returned a newly formulated ProHeart 6 to the market in 2008. ProHeart 6 remains on the market in many other countries, including Canada and Japan. Its sister product, [[ProHeart 12]], is used extensively in Australia and Asia as a 12-month injectable preventive. It was approved for use in the United States by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] in July 2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Medicine|first=Center for Veterinary|date=2019-07-02|title=FDA Approves ProHeart 12 (moxidectin) for Prevention of Heartworm Disease in Dogs|url=https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/cvm-updates/fda-approves-proheart-12-moxidectin-prevention-heartworm-disease-dogs|journal=FDA|language=en}}</ref> Topical treatments are available, as well.  Advantage Multi (imidacloprid + moxidectin) Topical Solution, uses moxidectin for control and prevention of [[Toxocaridae|roundworms]], [[hookworms]], heartworms, and [[whipworms]], as well as [[imidacloprid]] to kill adult [[fleas]].  [[Selamectin]] ([[Revolution (pet medicine)|Revolution]]) is a topical preventive likewise administered monthly, and can also be used to control fleas, [[ticks]], and [[mites]].\n\nPreventive drugs are highly effective, and when regularly administered, have been shown to protect more than 99% of dogs and cats from heartworm. Most compromises in protection result from the failure to properly administer the drugs during seasonal transmission periods.<ref name=\"Knight 1998\"/> In regions where the temperature is consistently above 14&nbsp;\u00b0C (57&nbsp;\u00b0F) year-round, a continuous prevention schedule is recommended.\n\nDue to newly emerging resistant strains of heartworms, which no macrocyclic lactone (heartworm prevention) can protect against, the American Heartworm Society recommends dogs be on a repellent and a heartworm preventive. The repellent, such as Vectra 3-D, keeps mosquitoes from feeding on the dog and transmitting the L<sub>3</sub> stage worms. If a dog is bitten, the heartworm preventive takes over when administered. If a mosquito feeds on a heartworm positive dog on a repellent, they do not live long enough for the microfilaria they ingested to molt into the ineffective L<sub>3</sub> larva. Vectra 3-D was tested using thousands of mosquitoes infected with the resistant heartworm strain JYD34. In the control group that was given only a placebo, every dog contracted heartworms. In the experimental group that was given only Vectra 3-D, two of eight dogs contracted heartworms and had an average of 1.5 adult worms each. In the experimental group given both heartworm prevention and Vectra 3-D, one dog was infected with L<sub>3</sub> stage larvae that did not mature into adulthood due to the heartworm prevention. Using a repellant and a prevention is over 99% effective.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fightheartwormnow.com/|title=Fight Heartworm Now|website=Fight Heartworm Now}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2019}}\n\nIvermectin, even with lapses up to four months between doses, still provides 95% protection from adult worms.

Because of this, differences between canine and feline heartworm diseases are significant.  The majority of heartworm larvae do not survive in cats, so unlike in dogs, a typical infection in cats is two to five worms.  The lifespan of heartworms is considerably shorter in cats, only two to three years, and most infections in cats do not have circulating microfilariae.  Cats are also more likely to have aberrant migration of heartworm larvae, resulting in infections in the brain or body cavities.<ref name=AHS_2007>{{cite web|title=2007 Guidelines For the Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Heartworm (''Dirofilaria immitis'') Infection in Cats |publisher=American Heartworm Society |year=2007 |url=http://www.heartwormsociety.org/article.asp?id=47 |accessdate=2007-07-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614130430/http://www.heartwormsociety.org/article.asp?id=47 |archivedate=2007-06-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe infection rate in cats is 1-5% of that in dogs in [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] areas.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Berdoulay P, Levy JK, Snyder PS |title=Comparison of serological tests for the detection of natural heartworm infection in cats |journal=Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=376&ndash;84 |year=2004 |pmid=15347617 |doi=10.5326/0400376|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  Both indoor and outdoor cats are infected.

The subsequent inflammation of the pulmonary vasculature and lungs can be easily misdiagnosed as [[feline asthma]] or allergic bronchitis.<ref name=forum_246>{{Cite journal| last = Yin | first = Sophia | title = Update on heartworm infection | journal = Veterinary Forum | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 42&ndash;43 |date=June 2007}}</ref>\n\nObstruction of pulmonary arteries due to [[Embolism|emboli]] from dying worms is more likely to be fatal in cats than dogs because of less [[collateral circulation]] and fewer vessels.<ref name=Foley_2005>{{Cite book|editor=August, John R.|chapter=Heartworm Disease|author1=Atkins, Clarke E. |author2=Litster, Annette L. |title=Consultations in Feline Internal Medicine Vol. 5|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7216-0423-7}}</ref>\n\n===Signs and symptoms===\nAcute heartworm disease in cats can result in [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], vomiting, diarrhea, fainting, and sudden death.

The signs of heartworm-associated respiratory disease can persist even after complete elimination of the heartworm infection.<ref name=forum_246/> Normally, a cat's immune response is strong enough to clear a heartworm infection; however, the immune response itself can cause the same signs associated with heartworm disease.<ref name=\"Reno, Tabitha.\">Reno, Tabitha.

Like in dogs, a positive [[ELISA]] test for heartworm antigen is a very strong indication of infection.  However, the likelihood of a positive antigen test depends on the number of adult female worms present.  If only male worms are present, the test will be negative.  Even with female worms, an antigen test usually only becomes positive seven to eight months after infection.  Therefore, a cat may have significant clinical signs long before the development of a positive test.  Heartworm-associated respiratory disease can be found in cats that never develop adult heartworms and therefore never have a positive antigen test.\n\nAn antibody test is also available for feline heartworm infection.  It will be positive in the event of exposure to ''D. immitis'', so a cat that has successfully eliminated an infection may still be positive for up to three months.  The antibody test is more sensitive than the antigen test, but it does not provide direct evidence of adult infection.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Atkins C |title=The diagnosis of feline heartworm infection |journal=Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=185&ndash;7 |year=1999 |pmid=10333254 |doi=10.5326/15473317-35-3-185}}</ref>  It can, however, be considered specific for diagnosing previous larval infections, and therefore fairly specific for heartworm-associated respiratory disease.\n\n[[Radiography|X-rays]] of the chest of a heartworm-infected cat may show an increased width of the pulmonary arteries and focal or diffuse opacities in the lungs.

A significant number of cats develop [[pulmonary embolism]]s a few days after treatment.  The effects of melarsomine are poorly studied in cats.  Due to a lack of studies showing a clear benefit of treatment and the short lifespan of heartworms in cats, adulticide therapy is not recommended, and no drugs are approved in the US for use in cats.<ref name=Foley_2005/>\n\nTreatment typically consists of putting the cat on a monthly heartworm preventive and a short-term [[corticosteroid]].<ref name=AHS_2007/>  Surgery has also been used successfully to remove adult worms.

The prognosis for feline heartworm disease is guarded.\n\n==Heartworm infection in humans==\nDirofiliaria are important medical parasites, but diagnosis is unusual and is often only made after an infected person happens to have a chest X-ray following granuloma formation in the lung. The nodule itself may be large enough to resemble [[lung cancer]] on the X-ray, and requires a [[biopsy]] for a pathologic assessment. This has been shown to be the most significant medical consequence of human infection by the canine heartworm. Patients are infected with the parasite through the bite of an infected mosquito, which is the same mechanism that causes heartworm infection in dogs.<ref name=\"Jewell, Tim\">Jewell, Tim.

Once the larvae develop into the infective third larval stage (L<sub>3</sub>), the mosquito locates and bites a host, depositing the larvae under the skin at the site of the bite.

Then, they migrate to the [[muscle]]s of the [[chest]] and [[abdomen]], and 45 to 60 days after infection, molt to the fifth stage (L<sub>5</sub>, immature adult). Between 75 and 120 days after infection, these immature heartworms then enter the bloodstream and are carried through the heart to reside in the pulmonary artery.

Rarely, migrating heartworm larvae get \"lost\" and end up in aberrant sites, such as the eye, brain, or an artery in the leg, which results in unusual symptoms such as blindness, [[seizures]], and [[lameness]], but normally, until the larvae mature and congregate inside the heart, they produce no symptoms or signs of illness.\n\nMany dogs show little or no sign of infection even after the worms become adults. These animals usually have only a light infection and live a fairly sedentary lifestyle. However, active dogs and those with heavier infections may show the classic signs of heartworm disease. Early signs include a cough, especially during or after exercise, and exercise intolerance. In the most advanced cases where many adult worms have built up in the heart without treatment, signs progress to severe weight loss, [[fainting]], coughing up blood, and finally, congestive heart failure.\n\n==Role of ''Wolbachia pipientis''==\n''[[Wolbachia pipientis]]'' is an intracellular [[bacterium]] that is an [[endosymbiont]] of ''D. immitis''.  All heartworms are thought to be infected with ''[[Wolbachia]]'' to some degree.  The inflammation occurring at the die-off of adult heartworms or larvae is in part due to the release of ''Wolbachia'' bacteria or protein into the tissues.  This may be particularly significant in cats, in which the disease seems to be more related to larval death than living adult heartworms.  Treating heartworm-positive animals with an antibiotic such as [[doxycycline]] to remove ''Wolbachia'' may prove to be beneficial, but further studies are necessary.<ref name=forum>{{Cite journal| last = Todd-Jenkins | first = Karen | title = The Role of ''Wolbachia'' in heartworm disease | journal = Veterinary Forum | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 28&ndash;30 |date=October 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis in dogs==\n[[File:Microfilaria of Dirofilaria immitis (Heartworms) Surrounded by Neoplastic Lymphocytes 1.jpg|thumb|Microfilaria of ''Dirofilaria immitis'' (heartworms) in a lymph node of a dog with lymphoma.

The accuracy of these tests, typically used for routine screening or diagnosis of heartworm infection, is improved by multiple testing. The modified Knott test and millipore filtration are more sensitive because they concentrate microfilariae, improving the chance of diagnosis.<ref name=\"Ettinger_2010\"/> The direct smear technique allows examination of larval motion, helping in the distinction of ''D. immitis'' from ''Acanthocheilonema reconditum''. This distinction is important because the presence of the latter parasite does not require expensive and potentially harmful therapy. The potential for a microfilaremic infection is 5 - 67%. The number of circulating microfilariae does not correlate with the number of adult heartworms, so is not an indicator of disease severity.<ref name=\"Ettinger_2010\"/>\n\n'''Antigen testing''', in most practices, has supplanted or supplemented microfilarial detection. Combining the microfilaria and adult antigen test is most useful in dogs receiving [[diethylcarbamazine]] or no preventive ([[macrolides]] like [[ivermectin]] or [[moxidectin]] typically render the dog amicrofilaremic). Up to 1% of infected dogs are microfilaria-positive and antigen-negative.<ref name=\"Ettinger_2010\"/>'''[[Immunodiagnostics]]''' ([[ELISA]], [[Lateral flow test|lateral flow immunoassay]], rapid immunomigration techniques) to detect heartworm antigen in the host's blood are now regularly used. They can detect occult infections, or infections without the presence of circulating microfilariae. However, these tests are limited in that they only detect the antigens released from the sexually mature female worm's [[reproductive tract]]. Therefore,  false-negative results may occur during the first five to eight months of infection when the worms are not yet sexually mature.<ref name=\"Ettinger_2010\"/> The [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of these tests is close to 100%, and the sensitivity is more than 80%.<ref>{{cite web| last = Atkins | first = Clarke | title = Heartworm Disease in Dogs: An Update | work = Proceedings of the 30th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2005 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2005&PID=10900&O=Generic | accessdate = 2007-02-26 }}</ref> A recent study demonstrated a sensitivity of only 64% for infections of only one female worm, but improved with increasing female worm burden (85%, 88%, and 89% for two, three, and four female worms, respectively).

Otherwise, if the dog is under exertion, dead worms may break loose and travel to the lungs, potentially causing [[respiratory failure]] and sudden death. According to the American Heartworm Society, the administering of [[aspirin]] to dogs infected with heartworms is no longer recommended due to a lack of evidence of clinical benefit, and aspirin may be contraindicated in several cases.  Aspirin had previously been recommended for its effects on platelet adhesion and the reduction of vascular damage caused by the heartworms.\n\nThe course of treatment is not completed until several weeks later, when the microfilariae are dealt with in a separate course of treatment. Once heartworm tests are negative and no surviving worm is detected, the treatment is considered a success, and the patient is effectively cured.\n\nSurgical removal of the adult heartworms as a form of treatment may also be indicated, especially in advanced cases with substantial heart involvement and damage.<ref>{{cite web|title=2005 Guidelines For the Diagnosis, Prevention and Management of Heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) Infection in Dogs |work=American Heartworm Society |year=2005 |url=http://www.heartwormsociety.org/article.asp?id=48 |accessdate=2008-07-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616144710/http://www.heartwormsociety.org/article.asp?id=48 |archivedate=2008-06-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nLong-term monthly administration of [[ivermectin]] year-round at three times the dose normally used for heartworm [[Heartworm#Prevention|prevention]] eventually kills adult heartworms. However, this is not the treatment of choice for removal of adult heartworms for two reasons. Firstly, this treatment is not as effective as melarsomine. More importantly, adult heartworms do not begin to die until 18 months of treatment have elapsed, which is not acceptable for dogs with high-volume infections, and the worms cause irreversible damage to the heart and lungs during that time.  Long-term treatment over a year with doxycycline daily and Heartgard Plus has been shown to be effective in early heartworm patients which are asymptomatic.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Prevention of infection in dogs==\nPrevention of heartworm infection can be obtained through a number of veterinary drugs. The drugs approved for use in the US are ivermectin (sold under the brand names [[Heartgard]], [[Iverhart]], and several other generic versions), [[milbemycin]] (Interceptor Flavor Tabs and [[Sentinel Flavor Tabs]]) and [[moxidectin]] (ProHeart) administered as pills or chewable tablets. Moxidectin is also available in both a six-month and 12-month, sustained-release injection, [[ProHeart 6]] or [[ProHeart 12]], administered by veterinarians.  The injectable form of moxidectin was taken off the market in the United States due to safety concerns in 2004, but the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] returned a newly formulated ProHeart 6 to the market in 2008. ProHeart 6 remains on the market in many other countries, including Canada and Japan. Its sister product, [[ProHeart 12]], is used extensively in Australia and Asia as a 12-month injectable preventive. It was approved for use in the United States by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] in July 2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Medicine|first=Center for Veterinary|date=2019-07-02|title=FDA Approves ProHeart 12 (moxidectin) for Prevention of Heartworm Disease in Dogs|url=https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/cvm-updates/fda-approves-proheart-12-moxidectin-prevention-heartworm-disease-dogs|journal=FDA|language=en}}</ref> Topical treatments are available, as well.  Advantage Multi (imidacloprid + moxidectin) Topical Solution, uses moxidectin for control and prevention of [[Toxocaridae|roundworms]], [[hookworms]], heartworms, and [[whipworms]], as well as [[imidacloprid]] to kill adult [[fleas]].  [[Selamectin]] ([[Revolution (pet medicine)|Revolution]]) is a topical preventive likewise administered monthly, and can also be used to control fleas, [[ticks]], and [[mites]].\n\nPreventive drugs are highly effective, and when regularly administered, have been shown to protect more than 99% of dogs and cats from heartworm. Most compromises in protection result from the failure to properly administer the drugs during seasonal transmission periods.<ref name=\"Knight 1998\"/> In regions where the temperature is consistently above 14&nbsp;\u00b0C (57&nbsp;\u00b0F) year-round, a continuous prevention schedule is recommended. \n\nDue to newly emerging resistant strains of heartworms, which no macrocyclic lactone (heartworm prevention) can protect against, the American Heartworm Society recommends dogs be on a repellent and a heartworm preventive. The repellent, such as Vectra 3-D, keeps mosquitoes from feeding on the dog and transmitting the L<sub>3</sub> stage worms. If a dog is bitten, the heartworm preventive takes over when administered. If a mosquito feeds on a heartworm positive dog on a repellent, they do not live long enough for the microfilaria they ingested to molt into the ineffective L<sub>3</sub> larva. Vectra 3-D was tested using thousands of mosquitoes infected with the resistant heartworm strain JYD34. In the control group that was given only a placebo, every dog contracted heartworms. In the experimental group that was given only Vectra 3-D, two of eight dogs contracted heartworms and had an average of 1.5 adult worms each. In the experimental group given both heartworm prevention and Vectra 3-D, one dog was infected with L<sub>3</sub> stage larvae that did not mature into adulthood due to the heartworm prevention. Using a repellant and a prevention is over 99% effective. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://fightheartwormnow.com/|title=Fight Heartworm Now|website=Fight Heartworm Now}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=November 2019}}\n\nIvermectin, even with lapses up to four months between doses, still provides 95% protection from adult worms.

Because of this, differences between canine and feline heartworm diseases are significant.  The majority of heartworm larvae do not survive in cats, so unlike in dogs, a typical infection in cats is two to five worms.  The lifespan of heartworms is considerably shorter in cats, only two to three years, and most infections in cats do not have circulating microfilariae.  Cats are also more likely to have aberrant migration of heartworm larvae, resulting in infections in the brain or body cavities.<ref name=AHS_2007>{{cite web|title=2007 Guidelines For the Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Heartworm (''Dirofilaria immitis'') Infection in Cats |publisher=American Heartworm Society |year=2007 |url=http://www.heartwormsociety.org/article.asp?id=47 |accessdate=2007-07-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614130430/http://www.heartwormsociety.org/article.asp?id=47 |archivedate=2007-06-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe infection rate in cats is 1-5% of that in dogs in [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] areas.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Berdoulay P, Levy JK, Snyder PS |title=Comparison of serological tests for the detection of natural heartworm infection in cats |journal=Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=376&ndash;84 |year=2004 |pmid=15347617 |doi=10.5326/0400376|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  Both indoor and outdoor cats are infected.

A syndrome related to this inflammatory reaction has been identified in cats: heartworm-associated respiratory disease, which can occur three to four months after the initial infection, and is caused by the presence of the L<sub>5</sub> larvae in the vessels.  The subsequent inflammation of the pulmonary vasculature and lungs can be easily misdiagnosed as [[feline asthma]] or allergic bronchitis.<ref name=forum_246>{{Cite journal| last = Yin | first = Sophia | title = Update on heartworm infection | journal = Veterinary Forum | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 42&ndash;43 |date=June 2007}}</ref>\n\nObstruction of pulmonary arteries due to [[Embolism|emboli]] from dying worms is more likely to be fatal in cats than dogs because of less [[collateral circulation]] and fewer vessels.<ref name=Foley_2005>{{Cite book|editor=August, John R.|chapter=Heartworm Disease|author1=Atkins, Clarke E. |author2=Litster, Annette L. |title=Consultations in Feline Internal Medicine Vol. 5|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7216-0423-7}}</ref>\n\n===Signs and symptoms===\nAcute heartworm disease in cats can result in [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], vomiting, diarrhea, fainting, and sudden death.  Chronic infection can cause loss of appetite, weight loss, lethargy, exercise intolerance, coughing, and difficulty breathing.  The signs of heartworm-associated respiratory disease can persist even after complete elimination of the heartworm infection.<ref name=forum_246/> Normally, a cat's immune response is strong enough to clear a heartworm infection; however, the immune response itself can cause the same signs associated with heartworm disease.<ref name=\"Reno, Tabitha.\"> Reno, Tabitha.

Like in dogs, a positive [[ELISA]] test for heartworm antigen is a very strong indication of infection.  However, the likelihood of a positive antigen test depends on the number of adult female worms present.  If only male worms are present, the test will be negative.  Even with female worms, an antigen test usually only becomes positive seven to eight months after infection.  Therefore, a cat may have significant clinical signs long before the development of a positive test.  Heartworm-associated respiratory disease can be found in cats that never develop adult heartworms and therefore never have a positive antigen test.\n\nAn antibody test is also available for feline heartworm infection.  It will be positive in the event of exposure to ''D. immitis'', so a cat that has successfully eliminated an infection may still be positive for up to three months.  The antibody test is more sensitive than the antigen test, but it does not provide direct evidence of adult infection.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Atkins C |title=The diagnosis of feline heartworm infection |journal=Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=185&ndash;7 |year=1999 |pmid=10333254 |doi=10.5326/15473317-35-3-185}}</ref>  It can, however, be considered specific for diagnosing previous larval infections, and therefore fairly specific for heartworm-associated respiratory disease.\n\n[[Radiography|X-rays]] of the chest of a heartworm-infected cat may show an increased width of the pulmonary arteries and focal or diffuse opacities in the lungs.  [[Echocardiography]] is a fairly sensitive test in cats.

A significant number of cats develop [[pulmonary embolism]]s a few days after treatment.  The effects of melarsomine are poorly studied in cats.  Due to a lack of studies showing a clear benefit of treatment and the short lifespan of heartworms in cats, adulticide therapy is not recommended, and no drugs are approved in the US for use in cats.<ref name=Foley_2005/>\n\nTreatment typically consists of putting the cat on a monthly heartworm preventive and a short-term [[corticosteroid]].<ref name=AHS_2007/>  Surgery has also been used successfully to remove adult worms.  Ivermectin, milbemycin, and selamectin are approved for use in cats in the US.  The prognosis for feline heartworm disease is guarded.\n\n==Heartworm infection in humans==\nDirofiliaria are important medical parasites, but diagnosis is unusual and is often only made after an infected person happens to have a chest X-ray following granuloma formation in the lung. The nodule itself may be large enough to resemble [[lung cancer]] on the X-ray, and requires a [[biopsy]] for a pathologic assessment. This has been shown to be the most significant medical consequence of human infection by the canine heartworm. Patients are infected with the parasite through the bite of an infected mosquito, which is the same mechanism that causes heartworm infection in dogs.<ref name=\"Jewell, Tim\"> Jewell, Tim.

It was thought to infect the human eye, with most cases reported from the southeastern United States. However, these cases are now thought to be caused by a closely related parasite of [[raccoons]], ''[[Dirofilaria tenuis]]''. Several hundred cases of [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] infections in humans have been reported in Europe, but these are almost always caused by another closely related parasite, ''[[Dirofilaria repens]]'', rather than the dog heartworm. However, a few cases are proven ''D. immitis'' infections.<ref name=\"TumolskayaPozio2016\"/> Although there have been a few proven cases, humans mostly never get infected with heartworms due to the larvae never fully maturing.<ref name=\"Jewell, Tim\"/> When the heartworm microfilariae are on their way through the skin, they often die since heartworms cannot survive in a human host, even if they make it into the bloodstream.<ref name=\"Jewell, Tim\"/> Once the heartworms die, the immune system in the human body reacts to their tissue with inflammation as it tries to destroy the heartworms.<ref name=\"Jewell, Tim\"/> When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary dirofilariasis.<ref name=\"Jewell, Tim\"/> Heartworms in humans is not a serious problem unless they are causing pain, discomfort, and other noticeable symptoms.<ref name=\"Jewell, Tim\"/>\n\n{{Clear right}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Traversa D., Cesare A.
