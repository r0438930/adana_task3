W. Bromiley, D. M. Beegle, and W. M. Smith, \u201cEnglish Versions,\u201d ed. Geoffrey W. Bromiley, The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Revised (Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1979\u20131988), 83.</ref> The [[Authorized King James Version]] of 1611 was sporadically altered until 1769, but was not thoroughly updated until the creation of the [[Revised Version]] in 1885; it was not until the [[Revised Standard Version]] of 1952 (New Testament in 1948) that a rival to the KJV was composed, nearly 350 years after the KJV was first published. The RSV gained widespread adoption among the mainstream Protestant Churches in America and a Catholic Edition was released in 1962.  It was updated as the [[New Revised Standard Version]] in 1989.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, Bibles increasingly appeared that were much less literal in their approach to translation. In 1946, the [[New English Bible]] was initiated in the United Kingdom, intended to enable readers to better understand the King James Bible. In 1958, [[John Bertram Phillips|J. B. Phillips]] (1906\u20131982) produced an edition of the [[New Testament]] [[Epistles|letters]] in paraphrase, the ''Letters to Young Churches'', so that members of his youth group could understand what the New Testament authors had written. In 1966, ''[[Good News for Modern Man]]'', a non-literal translation of the New Testament, was released to wide acceptance.  Others followed suit. [[The Living Bible]], released in 1971, was published by its author [[Kenneth N. Taylor]], based on the literal [[American Standard Version]] of 1901. Taylor had begun because of the trouble his children had in understanding the literal (and sometimes archaic) text of the King James Bible. His work was at first intended for children, but was later positioned for marketing to high school and college students, as well as adults wishing to better understand the Bible. Like Phillips' version, the Living Bible was a dramatic departure from the [[King James Bible|King James version]].\n \nDespite widespread criticism due to being a [[paraphrase]] rather than a translation, the popularity of [[The Living Bible]] created a demand for a new approach to translating the Bible into contemporary English called [[dynamic equivalence]], which attempts to preserve the meaning of the original text in a readable way. Realizing the immense benefits of a Bible that was more easily accessible to the average reader, and responding to the criticisms of the Living Bible, the [[American Bible Society]] extended the ''Good News for Modern Man'' to the [[Good News Bible]] (1976) by adding the Old Testament, in this more readable style. This translation has gone on to become one of the best selling in history. In 1996, a new revision of Taylor's Living Bible was published. This [[New Living Translation]] is a full translation from the original languages rather than a paraphrase of the Bible.\n\nAnother project aimed to create something in between the very literal translation of the [[King James Bible]] and the more informal [[Good News Bible]]. The goal of this was to create a Bible that would be scholarly yet not overly formal. The result of this project was the [[New International Version]] (1978). This version became highly popular in Evangelical Protestant circles.\n\nThe debate between the formal equivalence and dynamic (or 'functional') equivalence translation styles has increased with the introduction of [[Gender-neutral language|inclusive language]] versions. Various terms are employed to defend or attack this development, such as ''feminist'', ''gender neutral'', or ''gender accurate''. New editions of some previous translations have been updated to take this change in language into account, including the [[New Jerusalem Bible]] (1985), the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (1989), the [[Revised English Bible]] (1989), and [[Today's New International Version]] (2005). Some translations have approached the issue more cautiously, such as the [[English Standard Version]] (2001).\n\nA further process that has assisted in greatly increasing the number of English Bible versions is the use of the Internet in producing virtual bibles, of which a growing number are beginning to appear in print \u2013 especially given the development of \"[[print on demand]]\".\n\nToday, there is a range of translations ranging from the most literal, such as the ''[[Young's Literal Translation]]'' to the most free such as ''[[The Message (Bible)|The Message]]'' and ''[[The Word on the Street (book)|The Word on the Street]]''.\n\n==18th and 19th century translations==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Eerdmans, 1979\u20131988), 83.</ref> The [[Authorized King James Version]] of 1611 was sporadically altered until 1769, but was not thoroughly updated until the creation of the [[Revised Version]] in 1885; it was not until the [[Revised Standard Version]] of 1952 (New Testament in 1948) that a rival to the KJV was composed, nearly 350 years after the KJV was first published. The RSV gained widespread adoption among the mainstream Protestant Churches in America and a Catholic Edition was released in 1962.  It was updated as the [[New Revised Standard Version]] in 1989.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, Bibles increasingly appeared that were much less literal in their approach to translation. In 1946, the [[New English Bible]] was initiated in the United Kingdom, intended to enable readers to better understand the King James Bible. In 1958, [[John Bertram Phillips|J. B. Phillips]] (1906\u20131982) produced an edition of the [[New Testament]] [[Epistles|letters]] in paraphrase, the ''Letters to Young Churches'', so that members of his youth group could understand what the New Testament authors had written. In 1966, ''[[Good News for Modern Man]]'', a non-literal translation of the New Testament, was released to wide acceptance.  Others followed suit. [[The Living Bible]], released in 1971, was published by its author [[Kenneth N. Taylor]], based on the literal [[American Standard Version]] of 1901. Taylor had begun because of the trouble his children had in understanding the literal (and sometimes archaic) text of the King James Bible. His work was at first intended for children, but was later positioned for marketing to high school and college students, as well as adults wishing to better understand the Bible. Like Phillips' version, the Living Bible was a dramatic departure from the [[King James Bible|King James version]].\n \nDespite widespread criticism due to being a [[paraphrase]] rather than a translation, the popularity of [[The Living Bible]] created a demand for a new approach to translating the Bible into contemporary English called [[dynamic equivalence]], which attempts to preserve the meaning of the original text in a readable way. Realizing the immense benefits of a Bible that was more easily accessible to the average reader, and responding to the criticisms of the Living Bible, the [[American Bible Society]] extended the ''Good News for Modern Man'' to the [[Good News Bible]] (1976) by adding the Old Testament, in this more readable style. This translation has gone on to become one of the best selling in history. In 1996, a new revision of Taylor's Living Bible was published. This [[New Living Translation]] is a full translation from the original languages rather than a paraphrase of the Bible.\n\nAnother project aimed to create something in between the very literal translation of the [[King James Bible]] and the more informal [[Good News Bible]]. The goal of this was to create a Bible that would be scholarly yet not overly formal. The result of this project was the [[New International Version]] (1978). This version became highly popular in Evangelical Protestant circles.\n\nThe debate between the formal equivalence and dynamic (or 'functional') equivalence translation styles has increased with the introduction of [[Gender-neutral language|inclusive language]] versions. Various terms are employed to defend or attack this development, such as ''feminist'', ''gender neutral'', or ''gender accurate''. New editions of some previous translations have been updated to take this change in language into account, including the [[New Jerusalem Bible]] (1985), the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (1989), the [[Revised English Bible]] (1989), and [[Today's New International Version]] (2005). Some translations have approached the issue more cautiously, such as the [[English Standard Version]] (2001).\n\nA further process that has assisted in greatly increasing the number of English Bible versions is the use of the Internet in producing virtual bibles, of which a growing number are beginning to appear in print \u2013 especially given the development of \"[[print on demand]]\".\n\nToday, there is a range of translations ranging from the most literal, such as the ''[[Young's Literal Translation]]'' to the most free such as ''[[The Message (Bible)|The Message]]'' and ''[[The Word on the Street (book)|The Word on the Street]]''.\n\n==18th and 19th century translations==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!
