Lacey. Bailey suggested the formation of an 'Imperial Cricket Board'. In the letter, he suggested that the board would be responsible for formulation of rules and regulations which will govern the international matches between the three members: Australia, England and South Africa. Bailey, wanted to host a Triangular Test series between the participant countries in South Africa. Australia rejected the offer. However, Bailey did not lose hope. He saw an opportunity of getting the three members together during the Australia's tour of England in 1909.

The emergence of new technology saw the introduction of a [[third umpire]] who was equipped with video playback facilities.\n\nBy 1995, TV replays were made available for run outs and stumpings in Test matches with the third umpire required to signal out or not out with red and green lights respectively. The following year, the cameras were used to determine if the ball had crossed the boundary, and in 1997 decisions on the cleanness of catches could be referred to the third umpire.

The independent ICC was funded initially by commercial exploitation of the rights to the World Cup of One Day International cricket. As not all Member countries had [[Double taxation|double-tax agreements]] with the United Kingdom, it was necessary to protect cricket's revenues by creating a company, ICC Development (International) Pvt. Ltd \u2013 known as IDI, outside the UK. This was established in January 1994 and was based in Monaco.\n\nFor the remainder of the nineties, the administration of IDI was a modest affair. But with the negotiation of a bundle of rights to all ICC events from 2001\u20132008, revenues available to International cricket and the ICC member countries rose substantially. This led to a growth in the number of commercial staff employed by IDI in Monaco. It also had the disadvantage that the Council's cricket administrators, who remained at Lord's, were separated from their commercial colleagues in Monaco. The Council decided to seek ways of bringing all of their staff together in one office while protecting their commercial income from tax.\n\nThe option of staying at Lord's was investigated and a request was made, through [[Sport England]], to the British Government to allow the ICC to have all its personnel (including those working on commercial matters) in London \u2013 but be given special exemption from paying UK [[corporation tax]] on its commercial income. The British Government was unwilling to create a precedent and would not agree to this request. As a consequence, the ICC examined other locations and eventually settled on the emirate of [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. ICC is registered in [[British Virgin Islands]]. In August 2005, the ICC moved its offices to [[Dubai]], and subsequently closed its offices at Lord's and Monaco. The move to Dubai was made after an 11\u20131 vote by the ICC's Executive Board in favour.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/4326601.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cricket chiefs move base to Dubai | date=7 March 2005}}</ref>\n\nWhile the principal driver of the ICC's move to [[Dubai]] was the wish to bring its main employees together in one tax efficient location, a secondary reason was the wish to move offices closer to the increasingly important new centres of cricketing power in South Asia. Lord's had been a logical venue when the ICC had been administered by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) (a situation that lasted until 1993). But the growing power of India and Pakistan in world cricket had made the continued control of international cricket by a British private members club (the MCC) anachronistic and unsustainable. A direct consequence of the changes and reforms instituted in 1993 was eventually to be the move away from Lord's to a more neutral venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GD23Df05.html|title= Cricket's home moves closer to the money|work=[[Asia Times Online]]| date=23 April 2005|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Income generation==\n[[File:ICC logo 2010.jpg|thumb|Variant ICC Logo with old motto]]\nThe ICC generates income from the tournaments it organises, primarily the [[Cricket World Cup]], and it distributes the majority of that income to its members.

There was also investment income of $6.695 million in the period.{{Update inline|reason=There have been 3 World Cups since this date|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe ICC has no income streams from the bilateral international cricket matches ([[Test cricket|Test matches]], [[One Day International]] and [[Twenty20|Twenty20 Internationals]]), that account for the great majority of the international playing schedule, as they are owned and run by its members. It has sought to create other new events to augment its World Cup revenues. These include the [[ICC Champions Trophy]] and the [[ICC Super Series]] played in Australia in 2005. However these events have not been as successful as the ICC hoped. The Super Series was widely seen as a failure and is not expected to be repeated, and India called for the Champions Trophy to be scrapped in 2006.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/biggest-player-in-the-game-flexes-muscle/2006/01/06/1136387626870.html | location=Melbourne | work=[[The Age]] | title=Biggest player in the game flexes muscle | date=7 January 2006}}</ref> The [[2004 ICC Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy 2004]] event was referred to in ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden 2005]]'' by the editor as a \"turkey of a tournament\" and a \"fiasco\"; although the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy|2006 edition]] was seen as a greater success due to a new format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/267074.html |title=ICC President thanks India for \"outstanding\" ICC Champions Trophy | author=Murgatroyd, Brian / ICC|publisher=ESPN | work=Cricinfo |date= 6 November 2006|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/267074.html |title=When the cricket did all the talking |publisher=ESPN | work=Cricinfo |date= 7 November 2006|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ICC World Twenty20]], first played [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|in 2007]], was a success. The ICC's current plan is to have an international tournament every year, with a Twenty20 World Cup played in even number years, the World Cup continuing to be held the year before the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], and the ICC Champions Trophy in the remaining year of the cycle. This cycle will begin [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|in 2010]], one year after the [[2009 ICC World Twenty20|2009 edition]].\n\n== Rules and regulation ==\nThe International Cricket Council oversees playing conditions, bowling reviews, and other ICC regulations. The ICC does not have copyright to the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'': only the MCC may change the Laws, though this is usually done in consultation with the game's global governing body. The ICC maintains a set of playing conditions for international cricket which make slight amendments to the Laws. They also have a \"[[ICC Code of Conduct|Code of Conduct]]\" to which teams and players in international matches are required to adhere. Where breaches of this code occur the ICC can apply sanctions, usually fines. In 2008, the ICC imposed 19 penalties on players.\n\n==Umpires and referees==\nThe ICC appoints international [[umpire (cricket)|umpires]] and [[Match referee]]s who officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. The ICC operates 3 panels of umpires: namely the [[Elite Panel of ICC Umpires|Elite Panel]], the [[International Panel of Umpires and Referees|International Panel]], and the [[ICC Associates and Affiliates umpire panel|Associates and Affiliates Panel]].\n\nAs of April 2012, the Elite Panel includes twelve umpires. In theory, two umpires from the Elite Panel officiate at every Test match, while one Elite Panel umpire stands in ODI matches together with an umpire from the International Panel. In practice, members of the International Panel stand in occasional Test matches, as this is viewed as a good opportunity to see whether they can cope at the Test level, and whether they should be elevated to the Elite Panel. The Elite Panel are full-time employees of the ICC, although do still, very occasionally umpire [[first-class cricket]] in their country of residence. The average, annual, officiating schedule for Elite Umpires is 8\u201310 Test matches and 10\u201315 ODIs, a potential on-field workload of 75 days plus travel and preparation time per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Match officials|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003001326/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|archivedate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe International Panel is made up of officials nominated from each of the ten Test-playing cricket boards. The Panel Members officiate in ODI matches in their home country, and assist the Elite Panel at peak times in the cricket calendar when they can be appointed to overseas ODI and Test matches. International Panel members also undertake overseas umpiring assignments such as the ICC [[U/19 Cricket World Cup|Under 19 Cricket World Cup]] to improve their knowledge and understanding of overseas conditions, and help them prepare for possible promotion onto the Elite Panel. Some of these umpires also officiate in the Cricket World Cup. Each of the Test cricket boards nominates a \"third umpire\" who can be called upon to review certain on-field decisions through instant television replays. All third umpires are first-class umpires in their own county, and the role is seen as a step onto the International Panel, and then the Elite Panel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/88/match-officials/emirates-international-panel-of-icc-umpires|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044124/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/88/match-officials/emirates-international-panel-of-icc-umpires|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe inaugural ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel was formed in June 2006.\nIt superseded the ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel, created in 2005, and serves as the pinnacle for umpires from non-Test playing Members, with selection achieved through each of the five ICC Development Program Regional Umpires Panels.\nMembers of the Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel are eligible for appointments to ODIs involving ICC Associate Members, ICC Intercontinental Cup matches and other Associate and Affiliate tournaments. High-performing umpires may also be considered for other ICC events, including the ICC U/19 Cricket World Cup, and could also be invited to be involved in the ICC Champions Trophy and ICC Cricket World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|title=ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/89/match-officials/icc-associate-and-affiliate-international-umpires-panel|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602070629/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/89/match-officials/icc-associate-and-affiliate-international-umpires-panel|archivedate=2 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThere is also an [[Elite Panel of ICC Referees]] who act as the independent representative of the ICC at all Test and ODI matches. As of January 2009, it has 6 members, all highly experienced former international cricketers. The Referees do not have the power to report players or officials (which has to be done by the umpires), but they are responsible for conducting hearings under the ICC Code of Conduct and imposing penalties as required at matches, ranging from an official reprimand to a lifetime ban from cricket.

The independent ICC was funded initially by commercial exploitation of the rights to the World Cup of One Day International cricket. As not all Member countries had [[Double taxation|double-tax agreements]] with the United Kingdom, it was necessary to protect cricket's revenues by creating a company, ICC Development (International) Pvt. Ltd \u2013 known as IDI, outside the UK. This was established in January 1994 and was based in Monaco.\n\nFor the remainder of the nineties, the administration of IDI was a modest affair. But with the negotiation of a bundle of rights to all ICC events from 2001\u20132008, revenues available to International cricket and the ICC member countries rose substantially. This led to a growth in the number of commercial staff employed by IDI in Monaco. It also had the disadvantage that the Council's cricket administrators, who remained at Lord's, were separated from their commercial colleagues in Monaco. The Council decided to seek ways of bringing all of their staff together in one office while protecting their commercial income from tax.\n\nThe option of staying at Lord's was investigated and a request was made, through [[Sport England]], to the British Government to allow the ICC to have all its personnel (including those working on commercial matters) in London \u2013 but be given special exemption from paying UK [[corporation tax]] on its commercial income. The British Government was unwilling to create a precedent and would not agree to this request. As a consequence, the ICC examined other locations and eventually settled on the emirate of [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. ICC is registered in [[British Virgin Islands]]. In August 2005, the ICC moved its offices to [[Dubai]], and subsequently closed its offices at Lord's and Monaco. The move to Dubai was made after an 11\u20131 vote by the ICC's Executive Board in favour.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/4326601.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cricket chiefs move base to Dubai | date=7 March 2005}}</ref>\n\nWhile the principal driver of the ICC's move to [[Dubai]] was the wish to bring its main employees together in one tax efficient location, a secondary reason was the wish to move offices closer to the increasingly important new centres of cricketing power in South Asia. Lord's had been a logical venue when the ICC had been administered by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) (a situation that lasted until 1993). But the growing power of India and Pakistan in world cricket had made the continued control of international cricket by a British private members club (the MCC) anachronistic and unsustainable. A direct consequence of the changes and reforms instituted in 1993 was eventually to be the move away from Lord's to a more neutral venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GD23Df05.html|title= Cricket's home moves closer to the money|work=[[Asia Times Online]]| date=23 April 2005|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Income generation==\n[[File:ICC logo 2010.jpg|thumb|Variant ICC Logo with old motto]]\nThe ICC generates income from the tournaments it organises, primarily the [[Cricket World Cup]], and it distributes the majority of that income to its members. Sponsorship and television rights of the World Cup brought in over US$1.6 billion between 2007 and 2015, by far the ICC's main source of income.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/current/story/271994.html |title=ICC rights go to ESPN-Star|publisher=[[ESPN]] | work=[[Cricinfo]]|date= 9 December 2006|accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/276853.html |title=ICC set to cash in on sponsorship rights |publisher=[[ESPN]] | work=[[Cricinfo]] |date= 18 January 2007|accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref> In the nine-month accounting period to 31 December 2007 the ICC had operating income of $12.66 million, mainly from member subscriptions and sponsorship. In contrast, event income was [[US$]]285.87 million, including $239 million from the 2007 World Cup. There was also investment income of $6.695 million in the period.{{Update inline|reason=There have been 3 World Cups since this date|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe ICC has no income streams from the bilateral international cricket matches ([[Test cricket|Test matches]], [[One Day International]] and [[Twenty20|Twenty20 Internationals]]), that account for the great majority of the international playing schedule, as they are owned and run by its members. It has sought to create other new events to augment its World Cup revenues. These include the [[ICC Champions Trophy]] and the [[ICC Super Series]] played in Australia in 2005. However these events have not been as successful as the ICC hoped. The Super Series was widely seen as a failure and is not expected to be repeated, and India called for the Champions Trophy to be scrapped in 2006.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/biggest-player-in-the-game-flexes-muscle/2006/01/06/1136387626870.html | location=Melbourne | work=[[The Age]] | title=Biggest player in the game flexes muscle | date=7 January 2006}}</ref> The [[2004 ICC Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy 2004]] event was referred to in ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden 2005]]'' by the editor as a \"turkey of a tournament\" and a \"fiasco\"; although the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy|2006 edition]] was seen as a greater success due to a new format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/267074.html |title=ICC President thanks India for \"outstanding\" ICC Champions Trophy | author=Murgatroyd, Brian / ICC|publisher=ESPN | work=Cricinfo |date= 6 November 2006|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/267074.html |title=When the cricket did all the talking |publisher=ESPN | work=Cricinfo |date= 7 November 2006|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ICC World Twenty20]], first played [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|in 2007]], was a success. The ICC's current plan is to have an international tournament every year, with a Twenty20 World Cup played in even number years, the World Cup continuing to be held the year before the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], and the ICC Champions Trophy in the remaining year of the cycle. This cycle will begin [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|in 2010]], one year after the [[2009 ICC World Twenty20|2009 edition]].\n\n== Rules and regulation ==\nThe International Cricket Council oversees playing conditions, bowling reviews, and other ICC regulations. The ICC does not have copyright to the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'': only the MCC may change the Laws, though this is usually done in consultation with the game's global governing body. The ICC maintains a set of playing conditions for international cricket which make slight amendments to the Laws. They also have a \"[[ICC Code of Conduct|Code of Conduct]]\" to which teams and players in international matches are required to adhere. Where breaches of this code occur the ICC can apply sanctions, usually fines. In 2008, the ICC imposed 19 penalties on players.\n\n==Umpires and referees==\nThe ICC appoints international [[umpire (cricket)|umpires]] and [[Match referee]]s who officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. The ICC operates 3 panels of umpires: namely the [[Elite Panel of ICC Umpires|Elite Panel]], the [[International Panel of Umpires and Referees|International Panel]], and the [[ICC Associates and Affiliates umpire panel|Associates and Affiliates Panel]].\n\nAs of April 2012, the Elite Panel includes twelve umpires. In theory, two umpires from the Elite Panel officiate at every Test match, while one Elite Panel umpire stands in ODI matches together with an umpire from the International Panel. In practice, members of the International Panel stand in occasional Test matches, as this is viewed as a good opportunity to see whether they can cope at the Test level, and whether they should be elevated to the Elite Panel. The Elite Panel are full-time employees of the ICC, although do still, very occasionally umpire [[first-class cricket]] in their country of residence. The average, annual, officiating schedule for Elite Umpires is 8\u201310 Test matches and 10\u201315 ODIs, a potential on-field workload of 75 days plus travel and preparation time per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Match officials|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003001326/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|archivedate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe International Panel is made up of officials nominated from each of the ten Test-playing cricket boards. The Panel Members officiate in ODI matches in their home country, and assist the Elite Panel at peak times in the cricket calendar when they can be appointed to overseas ODI and Test matches. International Panel members also undertake overseas umpiring assignments such as the ICC [[U/19 Cricket World Cup|Under 19 Cricket World Cup]] to improve their knowledge and understanding of overseas conditions, and help them prepare for possible promotion onto the Elite Panel. Some of these umpires also officiate in the Cricket World Cup. Each of the Test cricket boards nominates a \"third umpire\" who can be called upon to review certain on-field decisions through instant television replays. All third umpires are first-class umpires in their own county, and the role is seen as a step onto the International Panel, and then the Elite Panel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/88/match-officials/emirates-international-panel-of-icc-umpires|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044124/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/88/match-officials/emirates-international-panel-of-icc-umpires|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe inaugural ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel was formed in June 2006.\nIt superseded the ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel, created in 2005, and serves as the pinnacle for umpires from non-Test playing Members, with selection achieved through each of the five ICC Development Program Regional Umpires Panels.\nMembers of the Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel are eligible for appointments to ODIs involving ICC Associate Members, ICC Intercontinental Cup matches and other Associate and Affiliate tournaments. High-performing umpires may also be considered for other ICC events, including the ICC U/19 Cricket World Cup, and could also be invited to be involved in the ICC Champions Trophy and ICC Cricket World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|title=ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/89/match-officials/icc-associate-and-affiliate-international-umpires-panel|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602070629/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/89/match-officials/icc-associate-and-affiliate-international-umpires-panel|archivedate=2 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThere is also an [[Elite Panel of ICC Referees]] who act as the independent representative of the ICC at all Test and ODI matches. As of January 2009, it has 6 members, all highly experienced former international cricketers. The Referees do not have the power to report players or officials (which has to be done by the umpires), but they are responsible for conducting hearings under the ICC Code of Conduct and imposing penalties as required at matches, ranging from an official reprimand to a lifetime ban from cricket. Decisions can be appealed, but the original decision is upheld in most cases.\n\nThe Council failed to achieve consensus among the cricket playing nations \u2013 as of June 2012 \u2013 on the universal application of Umpire's Decision Review System, due to opposition by BCCI. It will continue to be applied subject to mutual agreement of the playing countries.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-27/top-stories/32440276_1_drs-ball-tracking-icc-executive-board| title= No decision yet on universal application of DRS\n|work=Times of India |date=27 June 2012}}</ref> In July 2012, ICC decided to send a delegation to show the ball tracking research done by Dr Ed Rosten, an expert on computer vision and technology, to BCCI to remove the scepticism about the use of DRS technology.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-10/top-stories/32617106_1_expert-in-computer-vision-icc-management-decision-review-system| title= Research on DRS to be shown to BCCI\n| date= 10 July 2012 |work=Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ireland and Afghanistan ICC newest full members amid wide-ranging governance reform|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/422449|website=icc-cricket.com|publisher=ICC|accessdate=22 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Regional bodies==\nThese regional bodies aim to organise, promote and develop the game of cricket:\n* [[African Cricket Association]]\n* [[Asian Cricket Council]]\n* [[ICC Americas]]\n* [[ICC East Asia-Pacific]]\n* [[European Cricket Council]]\n\nTwo further regional bodies were disestablished following the creation of the African Cricket Association:\n* [[East and Central Africa Cricket Council]]\n* [[West Africa Cricket Council]]\n\n==Competitions and awards==\n{{Main|International cricket}}\n\n=== Rankings ===\n\n* [[ICC Test Championship]] (Notional league for Test rankings)\n* [[ICC ODI Championship]] (Notional league for ODI rankings)\n* [[ICC T20I Championship]] (Notional league for T20I rankings)\n\n=== Tournaments ===\nThe ICC organises various international '''''test''''', '''''one-day''''' and '''''Twenty20''''' cricket competitions:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Format\n! colspan=\"2\" |Men\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Women\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Youth\n|-\n!Full Members\n!Associates Members\n|-\n|[[Test cricket|Test]]\n|[[ICC World Test Championship]]\n|[[ICC Intercontinental Cup]] (defunct)\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[One-day cricket|One-day]]\n|[[Cricket World Cup|ICC Cricket World Cup]]\n|[[ICC World Cricket League]] (defunct)\n|[[ICC Women's Cricket World Cup]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Under-19 Cricket World Cup|ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup]]\n|-\n|[[ICC Champions Trophy]] (defunct)\n|[[ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier]]\n|[[ICC Women's Championship]]\n|-\n|[[2020\u201322_ICC_Cricket_World_Cup_Super_League|ICC Cricket World Cup Super League]]\n|[[ICC Cricket World Cup League 2]]<br />[[ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Twenty20]]\n|[[ICC Men's T20 World Cup]]\n|[[ICC Men's T20 World Cup Qualifier]]\n|[[ICC Women's T20 World Cup]]\n|\n|}\nThe ICC has instituted the '''[[ICC Awards]]''' to recognise and honour the best international cricket players of the previous 12 months.

Following the corruption scandals by cricketers connected with the legal and illegal [[bookmaking]] markets, the ICC set up an Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) in 2000 under the retired [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner]] of the [[London Metropolitan Police]], [[Paul Condon, Baron Condon|Lord Condon]]. Among the corruption on which they have reported was that of former [[South African national cricket captains|South African captain]] [[Hansie Cronje]] who had accepted substantial sums of money from an Indian bookmaker for under-performing or ensuring that certain matches had a pre-determined result. Similarly, the former [[Indian national cricket captains|Indian captain]] [[Mohammad Azharuddin]] and [[Ajay Jadeja]] were investigated, found guilty of match-fixing, and banned from playing cricket (for life and for five years, respectively).  The ACSU continues to monitor and investigate any reports of corruption in cricket and protocols have been introduced, which for example prohibit the use of [[mobile telephone]]s in [[Changeroom|dressing room]]s.\n\nPrior to the 2007 [[Cricket World Cup]] ICC chief executive [[Malcolm Speed]] warned against any corruption and said that the ICC would be vigilant and intolerant against it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20070213/sports/sports3.html |work=The Jamaica Star |title=Speed warns against corruption during World Cup |date=13 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201121545/http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20070213/sports/sports3.html |archivedate=1 February 2009  }}</ref>\n\nFollowing a [[Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal|scandal that occurred]] during the 2010 Pakistan tour of England, 3 Pakistani players, [[Mohammad Amir]], [[Mohammad Asif (cricketer)|Mohammad Asif]] and [[Salman Butt]] were found to be guilty of spot-fixing, and were banned for 5 years, 7 years and 10 years respectively.
