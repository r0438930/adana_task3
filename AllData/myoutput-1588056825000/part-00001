Prior to printing, distributed works were copied manually, by [[scribe]]s. Due to printing, publishing progressed hand-in-hand with the [[History of books|development of books]].\n\nThe Chinese inventor [[Bi Sheng]] made [[movable type]] of earthenware circa 1045, but there are no known surviving examples of his work. Around 1450, in what is commonly regarded as an independent invention, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented movable type in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and [[hand mould]]. This invention gradually made books less expensive to produce and more widely available.\n\nEarly printed books, single sheets and images which were created before 1501 in Europe are known as [[incunable]]s or ''incunabula''. \"A man born in 1453, the year of the fall of Constantinople, could look back from his fiftieth year on a lifetime in which about eight million books had been printed, more perhaps than all the scribes of Europe had produced since Constantine founded his city in A.D. 330.\"<ref>[[Michael Clapham (industrialist)|Clapham, Michael]], \"Printing\" in ''A History of Technology'', Vol 2.

Eisenstein]], ''The Printing Press as an Agent of Change'' (Cambridge University, 1980).</ref>\n\nEventually, printing enabled other forms of publishing besides books. The [[History of newspaper publishing|history of modern newspaper publishing]] started in Germany in 1609, with [[magazine#History|publishing of magazines]] following in 1663. \n\nMissionaries brought printing presses to sub-Saharan Africa in the mid-18th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theelephant.info/culture/2019/12/13/african-publishing-minefields-and-the-woes-of-the-african-writer/|title=African Publishing Minefields and the Woes of the African Writer|last=Gazemba|first=Stanley|date=2019-12-13|website=The Elephant|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, publishing has been handled by [[#Publishing as a business|publishers]], although some authors self-published.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pw.org/content/notable_moments_in_selfpublishing_history_a_timeline|title=Notable Moments in Self-Publishing History: A Timeline|date=2013-11-01|website=Poets & Writers|language=en|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> The [[History of the World Wide Web|establishment of the World Wide Web]] in 1989 soon propelled the [[website]] into a dominant medium of publishing. [[history of wikis|Wikis]] and [[history of blogging|Blogs]] soon developed, followed by [[online book]]s, [[Online newspaper#History|online newspapers]], and [[online magazine]]s.\n\nSince its start, the World Wide Web has been facilitating the [[technological convergence]] of commercial and self-published content, as well as the convergence of publishing and producing into [[Online producer|online production]] through the development of [[multimedia]] content.\n\n==The process of publishing (traditional)==\nBook publishers buy or commission copy from independent authors; newspaper publishers, by contrast, usually hire staff to produce copy, although they may also employ freelance journalists, called [[Stringer (journalism)|stringers]]. Magazines may employ either strategy or a mixture. \n\nTraditional book publishers are selective about what they publish.  They do not accept manuscripts direct from authors.  Authors must first submit a query letter or proposal, either to a [[literary agent]] or direct to the publisher. depending on the publisher's submission guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allenandunwin.com/being-a-writer/getting-published/submitting-your-work|title=Submitting your work - Allen & Unwin - Australia|website=www.allenandunwin.com|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> If the publisher does accept unsolicited [[manuscript (publishing)|manuscripts]], then the manuscript is placed in the [[slush pile]], which [[publisher's reader]]s sift through to identify manuscripts worthy of publication. The acquisitions editors review these and if they agree, send them to the editorial staff. Larger companies have more levels of assessment between submission and publication than smaller companies. Unsolicited submissions have a very low rate of acceptance, with some estimates as low as 3 out of every 10,000 being accepted.<ref>{{cite web\n| author=Tara K. Harper\n| url=http://www.tarakharper.com/faq_pub.htm\n| title = On Publishers and Getting Published\n| year = 2004\n|access-date= 28 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Acceptance and negotiation===\nOnce a work is accepted, [[commissioning editor]]s negotiate the purchase of [[intellectual property]] rights and agree on [[royalties|royalty]] rates.\n\nAuthors typically sell exclusive territorial intellectual property rights that match the list of countries in which distribution is proposed (i.e. the rights match the legal systems under which copyright protections can be enforced). In the case of books, the publisher and writer must also agree on the intended formats of publication \u2014 [[mass-market paperback]], \"trade\" [[paperback]] and [[hardback]] are the most common options.\n\nWhere distribution is to be by [[CD-ROM]] or other physical media, the same rules are applied.  However if distribution is offered electronically on the internet, national copyright can no longer be applied and this presents legal problems. These are usually solved by selling language or translation rights rather than national rights. Thus, internet access across the [[European Union]] is relatively open because of the laws forbidding discrimination based on nationality, but the fact of publication in, say, France, limits the target market to those who read [[French language|French]].\n\nThe parties must then agree on [[royalty rate]]s, (the percentage of the gross retail price to be paid to the author), and the [[advance payment]]. The publisher will estimate the potential sales and balance projected revenue against production costs. Royalties usually range between 10\u201312% of RRP. An advance is usually one third of the first print run's projected royalties. For example, if the first print run is 5000 copies at $14.95 with 10% royalties, potential royalties would be $7475 (10% x $14.95 x 5000). The advance would therefore be $2490. Advances vary greatly, with established authors commanding larger advances.\n\n===Stages of Publishing===\nThe publishing process includes creation, acquisition, [[copy editing]], production, [[printing]] (and its [[Electronic publishing|electronic equivalents]]), [[marketing]], and [[distribution (business)|distribution]].\n\nAlthough listed as distinct stages, parts of these occur concurrently. As editing of text progresses, front cover design and initial layout takes place, and sales and marketing of the book begins.\n\nThe publisher may [[subcontract]] various aspects of this process to specialist companies and/or [[freelancer]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/about/faq/index.php?ToDo=view&questId=144&catId=11|title=Jobs and Careers \u2013 Help|publisher=Random House, Inc.|accessdate=13 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gs12.globalsuccessor.com/fe/tpl_penguin01.asp?newms=info03#para2|title=Jobs with Penguin|publisher=Penguin Books Ltd|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906215646/http://gs12.globalsuccessor.com/fe/tpl_penguin01.asp?newms=info03#para2|archivedate=6 September 2008|accessdate=13 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Editorial stage====\nIt is likely the author will be asked to work with an editor to improve the quality of the work.  Publishers may maintain a [[Style guide|house style]], and staff will [[copy edit]] to ensure that the work matches the style and grammatical requirements of each market.  Editing may also involve structural changes and requests for more information. Some publishers employ [[fact checker]]s, particularly regarding non-fiction works.\n\n====Design stage====\nThis stage includes the visual appearance of the product. The design process prepares the work for [[printing]] through processes such as [[typesetting]], dust jacket composition, specification of paper quality, binding method and casing.\n\nFor standard fiction titles, the design is usually restricted to typography and cover design. For books containing illustrations or images, design takes on a much larger role in laying out how the page looks, how chapters begin and end, colours, typography, cover design and ancillary materials such as posters, catalogue images, and other sales materials. Non-fiction illustrated titles are the most design intensive books, requiring extensive use of images and illustrations, captions, typography and a deep involvement and consideration of the reader experience.\n\nThe activities of typesetting, page layout, the production of negatives, plates from the negatives and, for hardbacks, the preparation of brasses for the spine legend and [[Imprint (bibliography)|Imprint]] are now all computerized. Prepress computerization evolved mainly in about the last twenty years of the 20th century. If the work is to be distributed electronically, the final files are saved in formats appropriate to the target operating systems of the hardware used for reading. These may include [[PDF]] files.\n\n====Sales and marketing stage====\nAs editing and design are underway, sales people may start talking about the book with their customers to build early interest. Publishing companies often send advance information sheets to customers or overseas publishers to gauge possible sales. This information feeds back through the editorial process and may affect the formatting of the book and the strategy employed to sell it. For example, if interest from foreign publishers is high, co-publishing deals may be established whereby publishers share printing costs in producing large print runs thereby lowering the per-unit cost of the books. Conversely, if initial feedback is not strong, the print-run of the book may be reduced, the marketing budget cut or, in some cases, the book is dropped from publication altogether.\n\nDedicated in-house salespeople are sometimes replaced by companies who specialize in sales to bookshops, wholesalers, and chain stores for a fee. This trend is accelerating as retail book chains and supermarkets have centralized their buying.\n\n====Printing====\nOnce editing and design are complete, the printing phase begins, starting with a [[pre-press proof]], for final checking and sign-off by the publisher. This proof shows the book precisely as it will appear once printed and represents the final opportunity for the publisher to correct errors. Some printing companies use electronic proofs rather than printed proofs. Once approved, printing \u2013 the physical production of the printed work \u2013 begins.\n\nRecently new printing process have emerged, such as [[printing on demand]] (POD) and [[web-to-print]]. The book is written, edited, and designed as usual, but it is not printed until the publisher receives an order for the book from a customer. This procedure ensures low costs for storage and reduces the likelihood of printing more books than will be sold. Web-to-print enables a more streamlined way of connecting customers to printing through an online medium.\n\n====Binding====\n{{Main| Bibliopegy}}\n\nIn the case of books, binding follows upon the printing process. It involves folding the printed sheets, \"securing them together, affixing boards or sides to it, and covering the whole with leather or other materials\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last                  = Hannett\n| first                 = John\n| title                 = Bibliopegia: Or the Art of Bookbinding, in All Its Branches\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=6O0YcnwsR-MC\n| accessdate            = 19 February 2013\n| edition               = 2\n| series                = Cambridge Library Collection: Printing and Publishing History\n| origyear              = 1836\n| year                  = 2010\n| publisher             = Cambridge University Press\n| isbn                  = 978-1-108-02144-9\n| page                  = 3\n| quote                 = Binding is the art of folding the sheets of a book, securing them together, affixing boards or sides thereto, and covering the whole with leather or other materials\n}}\n</ref>\n\n====Distribution====\nThe final stage in publication involves making the product available to the public, usually by offering it for sale. In previous centuries, authors frequently also acted as their own editor, printer, and bookseller, but these functions have become separated. Once a book, newspaper, or another publication is printed, the publisher may use a variety of channels to distribute it. Books are most commonly sold through [[bookselling|booksellers]] and through other retailers. Newspapers and magazines are typically sold in advance directly by the publisher to [[subscriber]]s, and then distributed either through the postal system or by [[newspaper carrier]]s. Periodicals are also frequently sold through [[newsagent]]s and vending machines.\n\nWithin the book industry, printers often fly some copies of the finished book to publishers as sample copies to aid sales or to be sent out for pre-release reviews. The remaining books often travel from the printing facility via sea freight. Accordingly, the delay between the approval of the pre-press proof and the arrival of books in a warehouse, much less in a retail store, can take some months. For books that tie into movie release-dates (particularly for [[children's films]]), publishers will arrange books to arrive in store up to two months prior to the movie release to build interest in the movie.\n\n==== Book Packaging ====\nIf the processes above, up to the stage of printing, are handled by a third party and then sold to the publishing company, it is known as ''[[book packaging]]''. This is a common strategy for smaller publishers, which buy the intellectual property rights then sell the package to other publishers and gain an immediate return on capital invested. The first publisher will often print sufficient copies for all markets and thereby get the maximum quantity efficiency on the print run for all.\n\n<br />\n\n==Publishing as a business==\n[[File:ChungyoEslite fullsize.png|thumb|[[Eslite Bookstore]] in [[Taiwan]].]]\n\nThere are four basic [[business model]]s in book publishing:\n\n# Traditional or commercial publishers: are selective as to which books they publish. If accepted, authors pay no costs to publish. In exchange for selling rights to their work, they receive free editing, design, printing, marketing and distribution services, and are paid royalties on sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publishlawyer.com/publishing-faq/#Q_What_is_self-publishing|title=Self-publishing \u2013 In traditional royalty publishing|last1=Steven|first1=Daniel|website=publishlawyer.com|publisher=Daniel N. Steven, LLC|accessdate=1 March 2018}}</ref>\n#[[Self-publishing]]: The author uses a self-publishing service to publish their work. Self-publishing houses are not selective, allowing all-comers to publish anything they wish. Most self-publishing houses offer enhanced services (e.g. editing, design) but authors may choose which (if any) to use.  The author bears all costs, keeps total control and retains full rights to the work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publishlawyer.com/publishing-faq/#Q_What_is_self-publishing|title=What is self-publishing|last1=Steven|first1=Daniel|website=publishlawyer.com|publisher=Daniel N.

Unlike genuine self-publishing services, the author is often obliged to use some or all of their additional services, and the press will often take rights to the work as part of their contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.writersandartists.co.uk/writers/advice/255/self-publishing/considering-self-publishing/self-publishing-vs-vanity-publishing-confused|title=Self-publishing vs vanity publishing.

Publishing is now a major industry with the largest companies [[Reed Elsevier]] and [[Pearson PLC]] having global publishing operations.\n\nSome businesses maximize their profit margins through [[vertical integration]]; book publishing is not one of them. Although newspaper and magazine companies still often own printing presses and binderies, book publishers rarely do. Similarly, the trade usually sells the finished products through a [[distribution (business)|distributor]] who stores and distributes the publisher's wares for a percentage fee or sells on a sale or return basis.\n\nThe advent of the Internet has provided the electronic way of book distribution without the need of physical printing, physical delivery and storage of books. This, therefore, poses an interesting question that challenges publishers, distributors, and retailers. The question pertains to the role and importance the publishing houses have in the overall publishing process. It is a common practice that the author, the original creator of the work, signs the contract awarding him or her only around 10% of the proceeds of the book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indexbooks.net/publishingcontract.htm |title=Sample Publishing Contract |publisher=Indexbooks.net |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>  Such contract leaves 90% of the book proceeds to the publishing houses, distribution companies, marketers, and retailers. One example (rearranged) of the distribution of proceeds from the sale of a book was given as follows:<ref name=\"ireaderreview.com\">{{cite web|url=http://ireaderreview.com/2009/05/03/book-cost-analysis-cost-of-physical-book-publishing/|title=Book Cost Analysis \u2013 Cost of Physical Book Publishing - Kindle Review \u2013 Kindle Phone Review, Kindle Fire HD Review|work=Kindle Review}}</ref>\n* 45% to the retailer\n* 10% to the wholesaler\n* 10.125% to the publisher for printing (this is usually subcontracted out)\n* 7.15% to the publisher for marketing\n* 12.7% to the publisher for pre-production\n* 15% to the author (royalties)\n\nThere is a common misconception that publishing houses make large profits and that authors are the lowest paid in the publishing chain. However, most publishers make little profit from individual titles, with 75% of books not breaking even. Approximately 80% of the cost of a book is taken up by the expenses of preparing, distributing, and printing (with printing being one of the lowest costs of all).  On successful titles, publishing companies will usually make around 10% profit, with the author(s) receiving 8\u201315% of the retail price. However, given that authors are usually individuals, are often paid advances irrespective of whether the book turns a profit and do not normally have to split profits with others, it makes them the highest paid individuals in the publishing process.\n\nWithin the electronic book path, the publishing house's role remains almost identical.  The process of preparing a book for e-book publication is exactly the same as print publication, with only minor variations in the process to account for the different mediums of publishing.  While some costs, such as the discount given to retailers (normally around 45%)<ref name=\"ireaderreview.com\"/> are eliminated, additional costs connected to ebooks apply (especially in the conversion process), raising the production costs to a similar level.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n[[Print on demand]] is rapidly becoming an established alternative to traditional publishing ''[[Print on demand|(see main article)]]''.\n\nBook clubs are almost entirely direct-to-retail, and niche publishers pursue a mixed strategy to sell through all available outlets \u2014 their output is insignificant to the major booksellers, so lost revenue poses no threat to the traditional symbiotic relationships between the four activities of printing, publishing, distribution, and retail.\n\n==Industry sub-divisions==\n===Newspaper publishing===\n{{Main|Newspaper}}\nNewspapers are regularly scheduled publications that present recent news, typically on a type of inexpensive paper called [[newsprint]]. Most newspapers are primarily sold to [[subscriber]]s, through retail newsstands or are distributed as advertising-supported [[free newspaper]]s. About one-third of publishers in the United States are newspaper publishers.<ref name=DOL>{{cite web | title = Career Guide to Industries, 2010\u201311 Edition: Publishing, Except Software | url = http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs013.htm | publisher = U.S. Department of Labor | author = Bureau of Labor Statistics | date = 17 December 2009 | accessdate = 28 May 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Periodical publishing===\n{{Main|Periodical publication}}\nNominally, periodical publishing involves publications that appear in a new edition on a regular schedule. Newspapers and magazines are both periodicals, but within the industry, the periodical publishing is frequently considered a separate branch that includes magazines and even [[academic journal]]s, but not newspapers.<ref name=DOL />  About one-third of publishers in the United States publish periodicals (not including newspapers).<ref name=DOL />\n\n===Book publishing=== <!-- [[Big Five (publishers)]] links here.

Many small- and medium-sized book publishers specialize in a specific area. Additionally, thousands of authors have created publishing companies and self-published their own works.\n\nWithin the book publishing, the '''publisher of record''' for a book is the entity in whose name the book's [[ISBN]] is registered. The publisher of record may or may not be the actual publisher.\n\nApproximately 60%<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/drm-lawsuit-independent-bookstores-amazon_n_2727519.html | work=Huffington Post |first=Andrew |last=Losowsky |title=Indie Bookstores File Lawsuit Against Amazon | date=20 February 2013}}</ref> of English-language books are produced through the \"Big Five\" publishing houses: [[Penguin Random House]], [[Hachette Book Group USA|Hachette]], [[HarperCollins]], [[Simon & Schuster]] and [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]. (See also: [[List of English-language book publishing companies]].)\n\n===Directory publishing===\nDirectory publishing is a specialized genre within the publishing industry. These publishers produce mailing lists, [[telephone book]]s, and other types of directories.<ref name=DOL /> With the advent of the Internet, many of these directories are now online.\n\n===Academic publishing===\n{{Main|Academic publishing}}\nAcademic publishers are typically either book or periodical publishers that have specialized in academic subjects. Some, like [[university presses]], are owned by scholarly institutions. Others are commercial businesses that focus on academic subjects.\n\nThe development of the [[printing press]] represented a revolution for communicating the latest hypotheses and research results to the academic community and supplemented what a scholar could do personally. But this improvement in the [[communication efficiency|efficiency of communication]] created a challenge for libraries, which have had to accommodate the weight and volume of literature.\n\nOne of the key functions that academic publishers provide is to manage the process of [[peer review]]. Their role is to facilitate the impartial assessment of research and this vital role is not one that has yet been usurped, even with the advent of social networking and online document sharing.\n\nToday, publishing academic journals and textbooks is a large part of an international industry. Critics claim that standardised accounting and profit-oriented policies have displaced the publishing ideal of providing access to all. In contrast to the commercial model, there is [[non-profit]] publishing, where the publishing organization is either organised specifically for the purpose of publishing, such as a [[university press]], or is one of the functions of an organisation such as a medical charity, founded to achieve specific practical goals. An alternative approach to the corporate model is [[Open access (publishing)|open access]], the online distribution of individual articles and academic journals without charge to readers and libraries. The pioneers of Open Access journals are [[BioMed Central]] and the Public Library of Science ([[PLoS]]). Many commercial publishers are experimenting with hybrid models where certain articles or government funded articles are made free due to authors' payment of processing charges, and other articles are available as part of a subscription or individual article purchase.\n\n===Tie-in publishing===\n{{Main|Tie-in}}\nTechnically, radio, television, cinemas, VCDs and DVDs, music systems, games, computer hardware and mobile telephony publish information to their audiences. Indeed, the marketing of a major film often includes a [[novelization]], a graphic novel or comic version, the soundtrack album, a game, model, toys and endless promotional publications.\n\nSome of the major publishers have entire divisions devoted to a single franchise, e.g. Ballantine Del Rey Lucasbooks has the exclusive rights to ''Star Wars'' in the United States; Random House UK (Bertelsmann)/Century LucasBooks holds the same rights in the United Kingdom. The game industry self-publishes through BL Publishing/[[Black Library]] ([[Warhammer Fantasy (setting)|Warhammer]]) and Wizards of the Coast ([[Dragonlance]], [[Forgotten Realms]], etc.). The BBC has its publishing division that does very well with long-running series such as [[Doctor Who]]. These multimedia works are cross-marketed aggressively and sales frequently outperform the average stand-alone published work, making them a focus of corporate interest.<ref name=\"cave\">Shelagh Vainker in Anne Farrer (ed.), \"Caves of the Thousand Buddhas\", 1990, British Museum publications, {{ISBN|0-7141-1447-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Independent publishing alternatives===\n{{See also|Alternative media}}\n\nWriters in a specialized field or with a narrower appeal have found smaller alternatives to the mass market in the form of [[small press]]es and [[self-publishing]]. More recently, these options include [[print on demand]] and [[ebook]] format. \n\n==Recent developments==\nThe 21st century has brought some new technological changes to the publishing industry. These changes include [[e-books]], [[print on demand]], and [[accessible publishing]]. E-books have been quickly growing in availability in major publishing markets such as the US and the UK since 2005. [[Google]], [[Amazon.com]], and [[Sony]] have been leaders in working with publishers and libraries to digitize books. As of early 2011, Amazon's [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] reading device is a significant force in the market, along with the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPad]] and the [[Barnes & Noble Nook|Nook]] from [[Barnes & Noble]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Along with the growing popularity of e-books, some companies like [[Oyster (company)|Oyster]] and [[Scribd]] have pursued the subscription model, providing members unlimited access to a content library on a variety of digital reading devices.\n\nThe ability to quickly and cost-effectively print on demand has meant that publishers no longer have to store books at warehouses, if the book is in low or unknown demand. This is a huge advantage to small publishers who can now operate without large overheads and large publishers who can now cost-effectively sell their backlisted items.\n\n[[Accessible publishing]] uses the digitization of books to mark up books into [[XML]] and then produces multiple formats from this to sell to consumers, often targeting those with difficulty reading. Formats include a variety larger print sizes, specialized print formats for [[dyslexia]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/making-reading-easier/ |title=Making Reading Easier \u2013 Paper Cuts Blog |newspaper=NYTimes.com |date=20 May 2008|author=Dwight Garner}}</ref> eye tracking problems and [[macular degeneration]], as well as [[Braille]], [[Digital accessible information system|DAISY]], [[audiobook]]s and [[e-books]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.readhowyouwant.com/Technology/overview.aspx |title=Overview of the Technology- Awards, Cost Savings|publisher=Radhowyouwant.com|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nGreen publishing means adapting the publishing process to minimise environmental impact. One example of this is the concept of on-demand printing, using digital or print-on-demand technology. This cuts down the need to ship books since they are manufactured close to the customer on a just-in-time basis.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kanter |first=James |url=http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/reading-green-on-demand/?scp=1&sq=green%20publishing%20toby&st=cse |title=Reading Green On Demand |publisher=Green blogs, New York Times |date=2 December 2008 |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nA further development is the growth of on-line publishing where no physical books are produced. The ebook is created by the author and uploaded to a website from where it can be downloaded and read by anyone.\n\nAn increasing number of authors are using [[niche marketing]] online to sell more books by engaging with their readers online.<ref>{{cite news |first=Alan |last=Rinzler |title=The Magic of Niche Marketing for Authors |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/booked/2010/07/29/the-magic-of-niche-marketing-for-authors/ |work=[[Forbes]] |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=3 July 2012 }}</ref> These authors can use free services such as [[Smashwords]] or Amazon's [[CreateSpace]] to have their book available for worldwide sale.  There is an obvious attraction for first time authors who have been repeatedly rejected by the existing agent/publisher model to explore this opportunity. However, a consequence of this change in the mechanics of book distribution is that there is now no mandatory check on author skill or even their ability to spell, and any person with an internet connection can publish whatever they choose, regardless of the literary merit or even basic readability of their writing.\n\n==Standardization==\nRefer to the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] divisions of ICS 01.140.40 and 35.240.30 for further information.<ref name=pub>{{cite web\n  | author = International Organization for Standardization\n  | title = 01.140.40: Publishing\n  | publisher =\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/products/standards/catalogue_ics_browse.htm?ICS1=01&ICS2=140&ICS3=40&\n  | accessdate = 14 July 2008 }}</ref><ref name=itpub>{{cite web\n  | author = International Organization for Standardization\n  | title = 35.240.30: IT applications in information, documentation and publishing\n  | publisher =\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_ics_browse?ICS1=35&ICS2=240&ICS3=30&\n  | accessdate = 14 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Legal issues==\n[[File:World Intellectual Property Organization Geneva.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[World Intellectual Property Organization]], [[Geneva]]]]\n{{Main|Publication}}\n\nPublication is the distribution of copies or [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] to the [[General public|public]].<ref name=\"bc\">{{cite web|author=WIPO |url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P98_14701 |title=Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works |publisher=Wipo.int |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"ucc\">{{cite web|url=http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/copyrights/The%20Universal%20Copyright%20Convention%20_Geneva%20Text--September.pdf |title=Microsoft Word \u2013 The Universal Copyright Convention _Geneva Text\u2014September |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125161930/http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/copyrights/The%20Universal%20Copyright%20Convention%20_Geneva%20Text--September.pdf |archivedate=25 November 2012 |df= }}</ref>  The [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] requires that this can only be done with the consent of the copyright holder, which is initially always the author.<ref name=\"bc\"/>  In the [[Universal Copyright Convention]], \"publication\" is defined in article VI as \"the reproduction in tangible form and the general distribution to the public of copies of a work from which it can be read or otherwise visually perceived.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/>\n\nIn providing a work to the general public, the publisher takes responsibility for the publication in a way that a mere printer or a shopkeeper does not.

Prior to printing, distributed works were copied manually, by [[scribe]]s. Due to printing, publishing progressed hand-in-hand with the [[History of books|development of books]].\n\nThe Chinese inventor [[Bi Sheng]] made [[movable type]] of earthenware circa 1045, but there are no known surviving examples of his work. Around 1450, in what is commonly regarded as an independent invention, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented movable type in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and [[hand mould]]. This invention gradually made books less expensive to produce and more widely available.\n\nEarly printed books, single sheets and images which were created before 1501 in Europe are known as [[incunable]]s or ''incunabula''. \"A man born in 1453, the year of the fall of Constantinople, could look back from his fiftieth year on a lifetime in which about eight million books had been printed, more perhaps than all the scribes of Europe had produced since Constantine founded his city in A.D. 330.\"<ref>[[Michael Clapham (industrialist)|Clapham, Michael]], \"Printing\" in ''A History of Technology'', Vol 2.

Eisenstein]], ''The Printing Press as an Agent of Change'' (Cambridge University, 1980).</ref>\n\nEventually, printing enabled other forms of publishing besides books. The [[History of newspaper publishing|history of modern newspaper publishing]] started in Germany in 1609, with [[magazine#History|publishing of magazines]] following in 1663. \n\nMissionaries brought printing presses to sub-Saharan Africa in the mid-18th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theelephant.info/culture/2019/12/13/african-publishing-minefields-and-the-woes-of-the-african-writer/|title=African Publishing Minefields and the Woes of the African Writer|last=Gazemba|first=Stanley|date=2019-12-13|website=The Elephant|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, publishing has been handled by [[#Publishing as a business|publishers]], although some authors self-published.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pw.org/content/notable_moments_in_selfpublishing_history_a_timeline|title=Notable Moments in Self-Publishing History: A Timeline|date=2013-11-01|website=Poets & Writers|language=en|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> The [[History of the World Wide Web|establishment of the World Wide Web]] in 1989 soon propelled the [[website]] into a dominant medium of publishing. [[history of wikis|Wikis]] and [[history of blogging|Blogs]] soon developed, followed by [[online book]]s, [[Online newspaper#History|online newspapers]], and [[online magazine]]s.\n\nSince its start, the World Wide Web has been facilitating the [[technological convergence]] of commercial and self-published content, as well as the convergence of publishing and producing into [[Online producer|online production]] through the development of [[multimedia]] content.\n\n==The process of publishing (traditional)==\nBook publishers buy or commission copy from independent authors; newspaper publishers, by contrast, usually hire staff to produce copy, although they may also employ freelance journalists, called [[Stringer (journalism)|stringers]]. Magazines may employ either strategy or a mixture. \n\nTraditional book publishers are selective about what they publish.  They do not accept manuscripts direct from authors.  Authors must first submit a query letter or proposal, either to a [[literary agent]] or direct to the publisher. depending on the publisher's submission guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allenandunwin.com/being-a-writer/getting-published/submitting-your-work|title=Submitting your work - Allen & Unwin - Australia|website=www.allenandunwin.com|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> If the publisher does accept unsolicited [[manuscript (publishing)|manuscripts]], then the manuscript is placed in the [[slush pile]], which [[publisher's reader]]s sift through to identify manuscripts worthy of publication. The acquisitions editors review these and if they agree, send them to the editorial staff. Larger companies have more levels of assessment between submission and publication than smaller companies. Unsolicited submissions have a very low rate of acceptance, with some estimates as low as 3 out of every 10,000 being accepted.<ref>{{cite web\n| author=Tara K. Harper\n| url=http://www.tarakharper.com/faq_pub.htm\n| title = On Publishers and Getting Published\n| year = 2004\n|access-date= 28 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Acceptance and negotiation===\nOnce a work is accepted, [[commissioning editor]]s negotiate the purchase of [[intellectual property]] rights and agree on [[royalties|royalty]] rates.\n\nAuthors typically sell exclusive territorial intellectual property rights that match the list of countries in which distribution is proposed (i.e. the rights match the legal systems under which copyright protections can be enforced). In the case of books, the publisher and writer must also agree on the intended formats of publication \u2014 [[mass-market paperback]], \"trade\" [[paperback]] and [[hardback]] are the most common options.\n\nWhere distribution is to be by [[CD-ROM]] or other physical media, the same rules are applied.  However if distribution is offered electronically on the internet, national copyright can no longer be applied and this presents legal problems. These are usually solved by selling language or translation rights rather than national rights. Thus, internet access across the [[European Union]] is relatively open because of the laws forbidding discrimination based on nationality, but the fact of publication in, say, France, limits the target market to those who read [[French language|French]].\n\nThe parties must then agree on [[royalty rate]]s, (the percentage of the gross retail price to be paid to the author), and the [[advance payment]]. The publisher will estimate the potential sales and balance projected revenue against production costs. Royalties usually range between 10\u201312% of RRP. An advance is usually one third of the first print run's projected royalties. For example, if the first print run is 5000 copies at $14.95 with 10% royalties, potential royalties would be $7475 (10% x $14.95 x 5000). The advance would therefore be $2490. Advances vary greatly, with established authors commanding larger advances.\n\n===Stages of Publishing===\nThe publishing process includes creation, acquisition, [[copy editing]], production, [[printing]] (and its [[Electronic publishing|electronic equivalents]]), [[marketing]], and [[distribution (business)|distribution]].\n\nAlthough listed as distinct stages, parts of these occur concurrently. As editing of text progresses, front cover design and initial layout takes place, and sales and marketing of the book begins.\n\nThe publisher may [[subcontract]] various aspects of this process to specialist companies and/or [[freelancer]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/about/faq/index.php?ToDo=view&questId=144&catId=11|title=Jobs and Careers \u2013 Help|publisher=Random House, Inc.|accessdate=13 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gs12.globalsuccessor.com/fe/tpl_penguin01.asp?newms=info03#para2|title=Jobs with Penguin|publisher=Penguin Books Ltd|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906215646/http://gs12.globalsuccessor.com/fe/tpl_penguin01.asp?newms=info03#para2|archivedate=6 September 2008|accessdate=13 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Editorial stage====\nIt is likely the author will be asked to work with an editor to improve the quality of the work.  Publishers may maintain a [[Style guide|house style]], and staff will [[copy edit]] to ensure that the work matches the style and grammatical requirements of each market.  Editing may also involve structural changes and requests for more information. Some publishers employ [[fact checker]]s, particularly regarding non-fiction works.\n\n====Design stage====\nThis stage includes the visual appearance of the product. The design process prepares the work for [[printing]] through processes such as [[typesetting]], dust jacket composition, specification of paper quality, binding method and casing.\n\nFor standard fiction titles, the design is usually restricted to typography and cover design. For books containing illustrations or images, design takes on a much larger role in laying out how the page looks, how chapters begin and end, colours, typography, cover design and ancillary materials such as posters, catalogue images, and other sales materials. Non-fiction illustrated titles are the most design intensive books, requiring extensive use of images and illustrations, captions, typography and a deep involvement and consideration of the reader experience.\n\nThe activities of typesetting, page layout, the production of negatives, plates from the negatives and, for hardbacks, the preparation of brasses for the spine legend and [[Imprint (bibliography)|Imprint]] are now all computerized. Prepress computerization evolved mainly in about the last twenty years of the 20th century. If the work is to be distributed electronically, the final files are saved in formats appropriate to the target operating systems of the hardware used for reading. These may include [[PDF]] files.\n\n====Sales and marketing stage====\nAs editing and design are underway, sales people may start talking about the book with their customers to build early interest. Publishing companies often send advance information sheets to customers or overseas publishers to gauge possible sales. This information feeds back through the editorial process and may affect the formatting of the book and the strategy employed to sell it. For example, if interest from foreign publishers is high, co-publishing deals may be established whereby publishers share printing costs in producing large print runs thereby lowering the per-unit cost of the books. Conversely, if initial feedback is not strong, the print-run of the book may be reduced, the marketing budget cut or, in some cases, the book is dropped from publication altogether.\n\nDedicated in-house salespeople are sometimes replaced by companies who specialize in sales to bookshops, wholesalers, and chain stores for a fee. This trend is accelerating as retail book chains and supermarkets have centralized their buying.\n\n====Printing====\nOnce editing and design are complete, the printing phase begins, starting with a [[pre-press proof]], for final checking and sign-off by the publisher. This proof shows the book precisely as it will appear once printed and represents the final opportunity for the publisher to correct errors. Some printing companies use electronic proofs rather than printed proofs. Once approved, printing \u2013 the physical production of the printed work \u2013 begins.\n\nRecently new printing process have emerged, such as [[printing on demand]] (POD) and [[web-to-print]]. The book is written, edited, and designed as usual, but it is not printed until the publisher receives an order for the book from a customer. This procedure ensures low costs for storage and reduces the likelihood of printing more books than will be sold. Web-to-print enables a more streamlined way of connecting customers to printing through an online medium.\n\n====Binding====\n{{Main| Bibliopegy}}\n\nIn the case of books, binding follows upon the printing process. It involves folding the printed sheets, \"securing them together, affixing boards or sides to it, and covering the whole with leather or other materials\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last                  = Hannett\n| first                 = John\n| title                 = Bibliopegia: Or the Art of Bookbinding, in All Its Branches\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=6O0YcnwsR-MC\n| accessdate            = 19 February 2013\n| edition               = 2\n| series                = Cambridge Library Collection: Printing and Publishing History\n| origyear              = 1836\n| year                  = 2010\n| publisher             = Cambridge University Press\n| isbn                  = 978-1-108-02144-9\n| page                  = 3\n| quote                 = Binding is the art of folding the sheets of a book, securing them together, affixing boards or sides thereto, and covering the whole with leather or other materials\n}}\n</ref>\n\n====Distribution====\nThe final stage in publication involves making the product available to the public, usually by offering it for sale. In previous centuries, authors frequently also acted as their own editor, printer, and bookseller, but these functions have become separated. Once a book, newspaper, or another publication is printed, the publisher may use a variety of channels to distribute it. Books are most commonly sold through [[bookselling|booksellers]] and through other retailers. Newspapers and magazines are typically sold in advance directly by the publisher to [[subscriber]]s, and then distributed either through the postal system or by [[newspaper carrier]]s. Periodicals are also frequently sold through [[newsagent]]s and vending machines.\n\nWithin the book industry, printers often fly some copies of the finished book to publishers as sample copies to aid sales or to be sent out for pre-release reviews. The remaining books often travel from the printing facility via sea freight. Accordingly, the delay between the approval of the pre-press proof and the arrival of books in a warehouse, much less in a retail store, can take some months. For books that tie into movie release-dates (particularly for [[children's films]]), publishers will arrange books to arrive in store up to two months prior to the movie release to build interest in the movie.\n\n==== Book Packaging ====\nIf the processes above, up to the stage of printing, are handled by a third party and then sold to the publishing company, it is known as ''[[book packaging]]''. This is a common strategy for smaller publishers, which buy the intellectual property rights then sell the package to other publishers and gain an immediate return on capital invested. The first publisher will often print sufficient copies for all markets and thereby get the maximum quantity efficiency on the print run for all.\n\n<br />\n\n==Publishing as a business==\n[[File:ChungyoEslite fullsize.png|thumb|[[Eslite Bookstore]] in [[Taiwan]].]]\n\nThere are four basic [[business model]]s in book publishing:\n\n# Traditional or commercial publishers: are selective as to which books they publish. If accepted, authors pay no costs to publish. In exchange for selling rights to their work, they receive free editing, design, printing, marketing and distribution services, and are paid royalties on sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publishlawyer.com/publishing-faq/#Q_What_is_self-publishing|title=Self-publishing \u2013 In traditional royalty publishing|last1=Steven|first1=Daniel|website=publishlawyer.com|publisher=Daniel N.

Publishing is now a major industry with the largest companies [[Reed Elsevier]] and [[Pearson PLC]] having global publishing operations.\n\nSome businesses maximize their profit margins through [[vertical integration]]; book publishing is not one of them. Although newspaper and magazine companies still often own printing presses and binderies, book publishers rarely do. Similarly, the trade usually sells the finished products through a [[distribution (business)|distributor]] who stores and distributes the publisher's wares for a percentage fee or sells on a sale or return basis.\n\nThe advent of the Internet has provided the electronic way of book distribution without the need of physical printing, physical delivery and storage of books. This, therefore, poses an interesting question that challenges publishers, distributors, and retailers. The question pertains to the role and importance the publishing houses have in the overall publishing process. It is a common practice that the author, the original creator of the work, signs the contract awarding him or her only around 10% of the proceeds of the book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indexbooks.net/publishingcontract.htm |title=Sample Publishing Contract |publisher=Indexbooks.net |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>  Such contract leaves 90% of the book proceeds to the publishing houses, distribution companies, marketers, and retailers. One example (rearranged) of the distribution of proceeds from the sale of a book was given as follows:<ref name=\"ireaderreview.com\">{{cite web|url=http://ireaderreview.com/2009/05/03/book-cost-analysis-cost-of-physical-book-publishing/|title=Book Cost Analysis \u2013 Cost of Physical Book Publishing - Kindle Review \u2013 Kindle Phone Review, Kindle Fire HD Review|work=Kindle Review}}</ref>\n* 45% to the retailer\n* 10% to the wholesaler\n* 10.125% to the publisher for printing (this is usually subcontracted out)\n* 7.15% to the publisher for marketing\n* 12.7% to the publisher for pre-production\n* 15% to the author (royalties)\n\nThere is a common misconception that publishing houses make large profits and that authors are the lowest paid in the publishing chain. However, most publishers make little profit from individual titles, with 75% of books not breaking even. Approximately 80% of the cost of a book is taken up by the expenses of preparing, distributing, and printing (with printing being one of the lowest costs of all).  On successful titles, publishing companies will usually make around 10% profit, with the author(s) receiving 8\u201315% of the retail price. However, given that authors are usually individuals, are often paid advances irrespective of whether the book turns a profit and do not normally have to split profits with others, it makes them the highest paid individuals in the publishing process.\n\nWithin the electronic book path, the publishing house's role remains almost identical.  The process of preparing a book for e-book publication is exactly the same as print publication, with only minor variations in the process to account for the different mediums of publishing.  While some costs, such as the discount given to retailers (normally around 45%)<ref name=\"ireaderreview.com\"/> are eliminated, additional costs connected to ebooks apply (especially in the conversion process), raising the production costs to a similar level.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n[[Print on demand]] is rapidly becoming an established alternative to traditional publishing ''[[Print on demand|(see main article)]]''.\n\nBook clubs are almost entirely direct-to-retail, and niche publishers pursue a mixed strategy to sell through all available outlets \u2014 their output is insignificant to the major booksellers, so lost revenue poses no threat to the traditional symbiotic relationships between the four activities of printing, publishing, distribution, and retail.\n\n==Industry sub-divisions==\n===Newspaper publishing===\n{{Main|Newspaper}}\nNewspapers are regularly scheduled publications that present recent news, typically on a type of inexpensive paper called [[newsprint]]. Most newspapers are primarily sold to [[subscriber]]s, through retail newsstands or are distributed as advertising-supported [[free newspaper]]s. About one-third of publishers in the United States are newspaper publishers.<ref name=DOL>{{cite web | title = Career Guide to Industries, 2010\u201311 Edition: Publishing, Except Software | url = http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs013.htm | publisher = U.S. Department of Labor | author = Bureau of Labor Statistics | date = 17 December 2009 | accessdate = 28 May 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Periodical publishing===\n{{Main|Periodical publication}}\nNominally, periodical publishing involves publications that appear in a new edition on a regular schedule. Newspapers and magazines are both periodicals, but within the industry, the periodical publishing is frequently considered a separate branch that includes magazines and even [[academic journal]]s, but not newspapers.<ref name=DOL />  About one-third of publishers in the United States publish periodicals (not including newspapers).<ref name=DOL />\n\n===Book publishing=== <!-- [[Big Five (publishers)]] links here.  Please do not change. -->\n{{See also|History of books}}\n{{Redirect|Book publishing company|the publisher named Book Publishing Company|The Farm (Tennessee)}}\n\nThe global book publishing industry accounts for over $100 billion of annual revenue, or about 15% of the total media industry.<ref>{{cite publication |url=http://www.internationalpublishers.org/images/data-statistics/2012/ipa-global-publishing-statistics-2.pdf|publisher =IPA Global|title=Publishing Statistics|first =R\u00fcdiger |last=Wischenbart|year = 2012}}</ref>\n\nBook publishers represent less than a sixth of the publishers in the United States.<ref name=DOL /> Most books are published by a small number of very large book publishers, but thousands of smaller book publishers exist. Many small- and medium-sized book publishers specialize in a specific area. Additionally, thousands of authors have created publishing companies and self-published their own works.\n\nWithin the book publishing, the '''publisher of record''' for a book is the entity in whose name the book's [[ISBN]] is registered. The publisher of record may or may not be the actual publisher.\n\nApproximately 60%<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/drm-lawsuit-independent-bookstores-amazon_n_2727519.html | work=Huffington Post |first=Andrew |last=Losowsky |title=Indie Bookstores File Lawsuit Against Amazon | date=20 February 2013}}</ref> of English-language books are produced through the \"Big Five\" publishing houses: [[Penguin Random House]], [[Hachette Book Group USA|Hachette]], [[HarperCollins]], [[Simon & Schuster]] and [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]. (See also: [[List of English-language book publishing companies]].)\n\n===Directory publishing===\nDirectory publishing is a specialized genre within the publishing industry. These publishers produce mailing lists, [[telephone book]]s, and other types of directories.<ref name=DOL /> With the advent of the Internet, many of these directories are now online.\n\n===Academic publishing===\n{{Main|Academic publishing}}\nAcademic publishers are typically either book or periodical publishers that have specialized in academic subjects. Some, like [[university presses]], are owned by scholarly institutions. Others are commercial businesses that focus on academic subjects.\n\nThe development of the [[printing press]] represented a revolution for communicating the latest hypotheses and research results to the academic community and supplemented what a scholar could do personally. But this improvement in the [[communication efficiency|efficiency of communication]] created a challenge for libraries, which have had to accommodate the weight and volume of literature.\n\nOne of the key functions that academic publishers provide is to manage the process of [[peer review]]. Their role is to facilitate the impartial assessment of research and this vital role is not one that has yet been usurped, even with the advent of social networking and online document sharing.\n\nToday, publishing academic journals and textbooks is a large part of an international industry. Critics claim that standardised accounting and profit-oriented policies have displaced the publishing ideal of providing access to all. In contrast to the commercial model, there is [[non-profit]] publishing, where the publishing organization is either organised specifically for the purpose of publishing, such as a [[university press]], or is one of the functions of an organisation such as a medical charity, founded to achieve specific practical goals. An alternative approach to the corporate model is [[Open access (publishing)|open access]], the online distribution of individual articles and academic journals without charge to readers and libraries. The pioneers of Open Access journals are [[BioMed Central]] and the Public Library of Science ([[PLoS]]). Many commercial publishers are experimenting with hybrid models where certain articles or government funded articles are made free due to authors' payment of processing charges, and other articles are available as part of a subscription or individual article purchase.\n\n===Tie-in publishing===\n{{Main|Tie-in}}\nTechnically, radio, television, cinemas, VCDs and DVDs, music systems, games, computer hardware and mobile telephony publish information to their audiences. Indeed, the marketing of a major film often includes a [[novelization]], a graphic novel or comic version, the soundtrack album, a game, model, toys and endless promotional publications.\n\nSome of the major publishers have entire divisions devoted to a single franchise, e.g. Ballantine Del Rey Lucasbooks has the exclusive rights to ''Star Wars'' in the United States; Random House UK (Bertelsmann)/Century LucasBooks holds the same rights in the United Kingdom. The game industry self-publishes through BL Publishing/[[Black Library]] ([[Warhammer Fantasy (setting)|Warhammer]]) and Wizards of the Coast ([[Dragonlance]], [[Forgotten Realms]], etc.). The BBC has its publishing division that does very well with long-running series such as [[Doctor Who]]. These multimedia works are cross-marketed aggressively and sales frequently outperform the average stand-alone published work, making them a focus of corporate interest.<ref name=\"cave\">Shelagh Vainker in Anne Farrer (ed.), \"Caves of the Thousand Buddhas\", 1990, British Museum publications, {{ISBN|0-7141-1447-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Independent publishing alternatives===\n{{See also|Alternative media}}\n\nWriters in a specialized field or with a narrower appeal have found smaller alternatives to the mass market in the form of [[small press]]es and [[self-publishing]]. More recently, these options include [[print on demand]] and [[ebook]] format. \n\n==Recent developments==\nThe 21st century has brought some new technological changes to the publishing industry. These changes include [[e-books]], [[print on demand]], and [[accessible publishing]]. E-books have been quickly growing in availability in major publishing markets such as the US and the UK since 2005. [[Google]], [[Amazon.com]], and [[Sony]] have been leaders in working with publishers and libraries to digitize books. As of early 2011, Amazon's [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] reading device is a significant force in the market, along with the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPad]] and the [[Barnes & Noble Nook|Nook]] from [[Barnes & Noble]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Along with the growing popularity of e-books, some companies like [[Oyster (company)|Oyster]] and [[Scribd]] have pursued the subscription model, providing members unlimited access to a content library on a variety of digital reading devices.\n\nThe ability to quickly and cost-effectively print on demand has meant that publishers no longer have to store books at warehouses, if the book is in low or unknown demand. This is a huge advantage to small publishers who can now operate without large overheads and large publishers who can now cost-effectively sell their backlisted items.\n\n[[Accessible publishing]] uses the digitization of books to mark up books into [[XML]] and then produces multiple formats from this to sell to consumers, often targeting those with difficulty reading. Formats include a variety larger print sizes, specialized print formats for [[dyslexia]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/making-reading-easier/ |title=Making Reading Easier \u2013 Paper Cuts Blog |newspaper=NYTimes.com |date=20 May 2008|author=Dwight Garner}}</ref> eye tracking problems and [[macular degeneration]], as well as [[Braille]], [[Digital accessible information system|DAISY]], [[audiobook]]s and [[e-books]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.readhowyouwant.com/Technology/overview.aspx |title=Overview of the Technology- Awards, Cost Savings|publisher=Radhowyouwant.com|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nGreen publishing means adapting the publishing process to minimise environmental impact. One example of this is the concept of on-demand printing, using digital or print-on-demand technology. This cuts down the need to ship books since they are manufactured close to the customer on a just-in-time basis.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kanter |first=James |url=http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/reading-green-on-demand/?scp=1&sq=green%20publishing%20toby&st=cse |title=Reading Green On Demand |publisher=Green blogs, New York Times |date=2 December 2008 |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nA further development is the growth of on-line publishing where no physical books are produced. The ebook is created by the author and uploaded to a website from where it can be downloaded and read by anyone.\n\nAn increasing number of authors are using [[niche marketing]] online to sell more books by engaging with their readers online.<ref>{{cite news |first=Alan |last=Rinzler |title=The Magic of Niche Marketing for Authors |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/booked/2010/07/29/the-magic-of-niche-marketing-for-authors/ |work=[[Forbes]] |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=3 July 2012 }}</ref> These authors can use free services such as [[Smashwords]] or Amazon's [[CreateSpace]] to have their book available for worldwide sale.  There is an obvious attraction for first time authors who have been repeatedly rejected by the existing agent/publisher model to explore this opportunity. However, a consequence of this change in the mechanics of book distribution is that there is now no mandatory check on author skill or even their ability to spell, and any person with an internet connection can publish whatever they choose, regardless of the literary merit or even basic readability of their writing.\n\n==Standardization==\nRefer to the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] divisions of ICS 01.140.40 and 35.240.30 for further information.<ref name=pub>{{cite web\n  | author = International Organization for Standardization\n  | title = 01.140.40: Publishing\n  | publisher =\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/products/standards/catalogue_ics_browse.htm?ICS1=01&ICS2=140&ICS3=40&\n  | accessdate = 14 July 2008 }}</ref><ref name=itpub>{{cite web\n  | author = International Organization for Standardization\n  | title = 35.240.30: IT applications in information, documentation and publishing\n  | publisher =\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_ics_browse?ICS1=35&ICS2=240&ICS3=30&\n  | accessdate = 14 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Legal issues==\n[[File:World Intellectual Property Organization Geneva.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[World Intellectual Property Organization]], [[Geneva]]]]\n{{Main|Publication}}\n\nPublication is the distribution of copies or [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] to the [[General public|public]].<ref name=\"bc\">{{cite web|author=WIPO |url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P98_14701 |title=Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works |publisher=Wipo.int |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"ucc\">{{cite web|url=http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/copyrights/The%20Universal%20Copyright%20Convention%20_Geneva%20Text--September.pdf |title=Microsoft Word \u2013 The Universal Copyright Convention _Geneva Text\u2014September |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125161930/http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/copyrights/The%20Universal%20Copyright%20Convention%20_Geneva%20Text--September.pdf |archivedate=25 November 2012 |df= }}</ref>  The [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] requires that this can only be done with the consent of the copyright holder, which is initially always the author.<ref name=\"bc\"/>  In the [[Universal Copyright Convention]], \"publication\" is defined in article VI as \"the reproduction in tangible form and the general distribution to the public of copies of a work from which it can be read or otherwise visually perceived.\"<ref name=\"ucc\"/>\n\nIn providing a work to the general public, the publisher takes responsibility for the publication in a way that a mere printer or a shopkeeper does not.
