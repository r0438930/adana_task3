The goddess [[Tyche]] was invited to come and live in the city, and her statue was placed in the hand of the statue of the emperor that was on top of the [[Column of Constantine]], on the Forum with the same name. Although by now Constantine openly supported Christianity, the city still offered room to pagan religions: there were shrines for the [[Dioscuri]] and [[Tyche]]. The [[Acropolis]], with its ancient pagan temples, was left as it was. As for worshipping the emperor, Constantine's mausoleum gave him a Christ-like status: his tomb was set amid 12 monuments, each containing relics of one of the Apostles. Constantine had continued to engage in pagan rituals. The emperor still claimed to be a supernatural being, although the outward form of this personality cult had become Christian.<ref>[https://www.livius.org/cn-cs/constantinople/constantinople01.html]</ref>\n\n[[File:Follis-Constantine-lyons RIC VI 309.jpg|thumb|300px|Early coin of Constantine commemorating the pagan [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] of ''[[Sol Invictus]]'']]\nAccording to some authors,{{Who|date=April 2011}} the issuing of the [[Edict of Milan]],<ref>\"[[Edict of Milan]]\", 313CE.{{cite web |url=http://gbgm-umc.org/UMW/Bible/milan.stm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717025539/http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/Bible/milan.stm |archivedate=2007-07-17 }}</ref> showed that Constantine continued the policy of toleration which [[Galerius]] had established.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} He \"continued to pay his public honors to the Sun\", until 325, on coins that showed him jointly with ''[[Sol Invictus]]'', whereas his later coins showed the [[labarum|Chi-Rho]] sign.<ref>MacMullan 1984:44.</ref> In that year he had the Christian Bishops convene at the [[First Council of Nicaea]], and from then on continued to take an active interest in the affairs of the Church.\n\nMany historians, including MacMullen, have seen the seeds of future persecution by the state in Constantine's more belligerent utterances regarding the old religion.<ref name=\"ramsey\"/> Other historians{{Who|date=April 2011}} emphasize that ''de facto'' [[paganism]] \"was tolerated in the period from Constantine to [[Gratian]].

Pagans used the occasion to attempt to revive the old rites. In 484, the [[Magister militum per Orientem]], [[Illus]], revolted against Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and raised his own candidate, [[Leontius (usurper)|Leontius]], to the throne. Leontius hoped to reopen the temples and restore the ancient ceremonies; as such, many Pagans joined in his revolt against Zeno.<ref name=\"PhotiusBibliotheca242\"/> Illus and Leontius were compelled, however, to flee to a remote [[Isauria]]n fortress, where Zeno besieged them for four years. Zeno finally captured them in 488 and promptly had them executed.<ref>Theophanes Chronographia s.a. A.M. 5976-5980; John Malalas Chronicle 15.12-15.14.</ref> Following the revolt, Zeno instituted harsh anti-paganism policies.

Kirsch, \"God Against the Gods,\" p. 278, Viking Compass, 1997.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Evaluation and legacy==\nExcept for the most recent literature, for at least the last 200 years historical scholarship has followed a conceptual scheme in which the persecution of those Mediterranean religions that we now label \"paganism\" was seen as the result of the [[religious intolerance]] inherent in the monotheistic Christian faith. The classic expression of this view occurs in the work of [[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]].'' As historian [[Harold A. Drake]] puts it, \"It is difficult to overestimate the influence of Gibbon's interpretation on subsequent scholarship.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions'', p. 8</ref>\n\nHarold Drake takes issue with the historiography of Gibbon, arguing that while persecution certainly occurred for religious reasons, that the underlying motivation was consolidation of power in the Constantinian dynasty, which was offered in the form of promoting the cult of Christianity to the exclusion of others. He writes that \"while there is obviously some truth in the proposition that intolerance follows from the rejection of other gods that lies at the core of monotheistic belief,\" this alone could neither explain why pagans had previously persecuted Christians, nor why there were \"important voices for moderation in the early Christian community.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions,'' p. 5</ref> H.A. Drake writes: \"Gibbon skirts a serious problem: for three centuries prior to Constantine, the tolerant pagans who people the Decline and Fall were the authors of several major persecutions, in which Christians were the victims.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions,'' p. 7</ref> Gibbon, however, implies that such an argument is in itself flawed, in that Christians later exaggerated the depth and magnitude of the persecutions against them. He argues that a diligent review of the earliest Christian source, Eusebius, reveals by his own accounting that less than one hundred Christians were executed in Palestine under [[Diocletian]] for refusing civic sacrifices as a test of their loyalty.<ref>Gibbon, Edward The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chapter XVI, Part 8; [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/732/732-h/732-h.htm#link2HCH0008 online text] from [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref>\n\nIt should be remembered, however, that early persecution of Christians did not follow the same prerogatives commonly ascribed to religious persecution in the modern sense, but rather arose from a feeling of \"otherness\" that Christians aroused in the society of the time, being adverse as they were to participating in the religious life of the Roman empire at large. Private religion, or the sacra privita, was not regulated by the state until the [[Christianization]] of the Empire, when paganism was proscribed even within the home. Private religion was the purview of the family and the individual, and varied between various ethnic groups. As such, many pagans were not opposed to Christian theology per se, but rather to the motivations of early Christians, who seemed rather \"unpatriotic\" in their isolation and aggressiveness towards other faiths. Christians were also seen as being a public embodiment of [[superstitio]]; what might be described today as [[religious zeal]], but which also had connotations of [[magical thinking]]. While this was usually regarded as a private vice, one which was commonly thought to cause mental instability, it could also been seen as dangerous to the order of society. Romans had previously ascribed superstitio to excessive practice of magic, as well as other religious groups, among them [[Judaism]], which was seen as opposed to the [[interpretatio romana]], under which their public observances would be syncretised and brought into line with Roman practices. Unlike Christianity, however, these groups were not generally seen as threats to traditional Roman religious observance itself, but as obstacles to civic order and [[Romanization]].\n\nPeter Garnsey strongly disagrees with those who describe the attitude of the \"plethora of cults\" that are labelled 'Paganism' as \"tolerant\" or \"inclusive.\"<ref>Garnsey 1984: 24</ref> What [[Ramsay MacMullen]] wrote, that in its process of expansion, the Roman Empire was \"completely tolerant, in heaven as on earth\"<ref>quoted after Garnsey 1984: 25</ref> (with the notable exceptions of the Jews and Christians), is for Garnsey a simple \"misuse of terminology.\"<ref name=\"Garnsey -25\">Garnsey 1984: 25</ref> The foreign gods were not tolerated, but made subject together with their communities when they were conquered.

The [[Acropolis]], with its ancient pagan temples, was left as it was. As for worshipping the emperor, Constantine's mausoleum gave him a Christ-like status: his tomb was set amid 12 monuments, each containing relics of one of the Apostles.

Pagans used the occasion to attempt to revive the old rites. In 484, the [[Magister militum per Orientem]], [[Illus]], revolted against Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and raised his own candidate, [[Leontius (usurper)|Leontius]], to the throne. Leontius hoped to reopen the temples and restore the ancient ceremonies; as such, many Pagans joined in his revolt against Zeno.<ref name=\"PhotiusBibliotheca242\"/> Illus and Leontius were compelled, however, to flee to a remote [[Isauria]]n fortress, where Zeno besieged them for four years. Zeno finally captured them in 488 and promptly had them executed.<ref>Theophanes Chronographia s.a. A.M. 5976-5980; John Malalas Chronicle 15.12-15.14.</ref> Following the revolt, Zeno instituted harsh anti-paganism policies.

Kirsch, \"God Against the Gods,\" p. 278, Viking Compass, 1997.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Evaluation and legacy==\nExcept for the most recent literature, for at least the last 200 years historical scholarship has followed a conceptual scheme in which the persecution of those Mediterranean religions that we now label \"paganism\" was seen as the result of the [[religious intolerance]] inherent in the monotheistic Christian faith. The classic expression of this view occurs in the work of [[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]].'' As historian [[Harold A. Drake]] puts it, \"It is difficult to overestimate the influence of Gibbon's interpretation on subsequent scholarship.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions'', p. 8</ref>\n\nHarold Drake takes issue with the historiography of Gibbon, arguing that while persecution certainly occurred for religious reasons, that the underlying motivation was consolidation of power in the Constantinian dynasty, which was offered in the form of promoting the cult of Christianity to the exclusion of others. He writes that \"while there is obviously some truth in the proposition that intolerance follows from the rejection of other gods that lies at the core of monotheistic belief,\" this alone could neither explain why pagans had previously persecuted Christians, nor why there were \"important voices for moderation in the early Christian community.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions,'' p. 5</ref> H.A. Drake writes: \"Gibbon skirts a serious problem: for three centuries prior to Constantine, the tolerant pagans who people the Decline and Fall were the authors of several major persecutions, in which Christians were the victims.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions,'' p. 7</ref> Gibbon, however, implies that such an argument is in itself flawed, in that Christians later exaggerated the depth and magnitude of the persecutions against them. He argues that a diligent review of the earliest Christian source, Eusebius, reveals by his own accounting that less than one hundred Christians were executed in Palestine under [[Diocletian]] for refusing civic sacrifices as a test of their loyalty.<ref>Gibbon, Edward The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chapter XVI, Part 8; [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/732/732-h/732-h.htm#link2HCH0008 online text] from [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref>\n\nIt should be remembered, however, that early persecution of Christians did not follow the same prerogatives commonly ascribed to religious persecution in the modern sense, but rather arose from a feeling of \"otherness\" that Christians aroused in the society of the time, being adverse as they were to participating in the religious life of the Roman empire at large. Private religion, or the sacra privita, was not regulated by the state until the [[Christianization]] of the Empire, when paganism was proscribed even within the home. Private religion was the purview of the family and the individual, and varied between various ethnic groups. As such, many pagans were not opposed to Christian theology per se, but rather to the motivations of early Christians, who seemed rather \"unpatriotic\" in their isolation and aggressiveness towards other faiths. Christians were also seen as being a public embodiment of [[superstitio]]; what might be described today as [[religious zeal]], but which also had connotations of [[magical thinking]]. While this was usually regarded as a private vice, one which was commonly thought to cause mental instability, it could also been seen as dangerous to the order of society. Romans had previously ascribed superstitio to excessive practice of magic, as well as other religious groups, namely [[Druidism]] and [[Judaism]], both of which were seen as opposed to the [[interpretatio romana]], under which their public observances would be syncretised and brought into line with Roman practices. Unlike Christianity, however, these groups were not generally seen as threats to traditional Roman religious observance itself, but as obstacles to civic order and [[Romanization]].\n\nPeter Garnsey strongly disagrees with those who describe the attitude of the \"plethora of cults\" that are labelled 'Paganism' as \"tolerant\" or \"inclusive.\"<ref>Garnsey 1984: 24</ref> What [[Ramsay MacMullen]] wrote, that in its process of expansion, the Roman Empire was \"completely tolerant, in heaven as on earth\"<ref>quoted after Garnsey 1984: 25</ref> (with the notable exceptions of the Jews, Christians and Druids), is for Garnsey a simple \"misuse of terminology.\"<ref name=\"Garnsey -25\">Garnsey 1984: 25</ref> The foreign Gods were not tolerated, but made subject together with their communities when they were conquered.
