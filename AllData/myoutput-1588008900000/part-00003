From humble beginnings, the [[Roman Republic]] (509 BCE to 27 BCE) and [[Roman Empire|empire]] (27 BCE to 476 CE) expanded to rule much of [[Europe]], northern [[Africa]], and the [[Middle East]] and thus comprised many agricultural environments of which the [[Mediterranean climate]] of dry, hot summers and cool, rainy winters was the most common. Within the Mediterranean area, a triad of crops were most important: [[grain]]s, [[olive]]s, and [[Viticulture|grapes]].\n \nThe great majority of the people ruled by Rome were engaged in agriculture. From a beginning of small, largely self-sufficient landowners, rural society became dominated by [[latifundium]], large estates owned by the wealthy and utilizing mostly slave labor. The growth in the urban population, especially of the city of Rome, required the development of commercial markets and long-distance trade in agricultural products, especially grain, to supply the people in the cities with food.\n\n==The \"delightful\" life==\n\nAgriculture in ancient Rome was not only a necess\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, but was idealized among the social elite as a way of life. [[Cicero]] considered farming the best of all Roman occupations. In his treatise ''[[De officiis|On Duties]]'', he declared that \"of all the occupations by which gain is secured, none is better than agriculture, none more profitable, none more delightful, none more becoming to a free man.\" When one of his clients was derided in court for preferring a rural lifestyle, Cicero defended country life as \"the teacher of economy, of industry, and of justice\" (parsimonia, diligentia, iustitia).<ref>''[[Pro Roscio Amerino]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0018%3Atext%3DS.%20Rosc.%3Asection%3D75 75.]</ref> [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], [[Columella]], [[Varro]] and [[Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]] wrote handbooks on farming practice.\n\nIn his treatise ''[[De Agri Cultura|De agricultura]]'' (\"On Farming\", 2nd century BC), Cato wrote that the best farms contained a [[Ancient Rome and wine|vineyard]], followed by an irrigated garden, willow plantation, olive orchard, meadow, grain land, forest trees, vineyard trained on trees, and lastly acorn woodlands.<ref name=\"Cato\">Cato the Censor, Columbia University Records of Civilization: On Farming, translated by Ernest Brehaut (Columbia University Press)</ref> Though Rome relied on resources from its many [[Roman province|provinces]] acquired through conquest and warfare, wealthy Romans developed the land in Italy to produce a variety of crops. \"The people living in the city of Rome constituted a huge market for the purchase of food produced on Italian farms.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite book |last=Hopkins |title=Conquerors and Slaves |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=1\u20139 |year=1978 |isbn=978-0521219457 }}</ref>\n\nLand ownership was a dominant factor in distinguishing the aristocracy from the common person, and the more land a Roman owned, the more important he would be in the city. Soldiers were often rewarded with land from the commander they served. Though farms depended on slave labor, free men and citizens were hired at farms to oversee the slaves and ensure that the farms ran smoothly.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n==Crops==\n===Grains===\nStaple crops in early Rome were [[millet]], and [[emmer]] and [[spelt]] which are species of wheat.  According to the Roman scholar [[Varro]], [[common wheat]] and [[durum wheat]] were introduced to [[Italy]] as crops about 450 BCE.<ref>Fussell, G. E.

Wheat was the preferred grain, but barley was widely eaten and also important as animal feed.<ref>Jasy, Naum (1950), \"The daily bread of the Ancient Greeks and Romans,\" ''Ostria,'', Vol. 9, pp. 231-233. Downloaded from [[JSTOR]].</ref>\n\nIn ''De re Rustica'' [[Columella]] wrote that emmer was more resistant to moisture than wheat. According to Columella four types of emmer were cultivated, including one variety that he calls Clusian (named for the town [[Clusium]]).<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.6.3-4</ref> Cato wrote that if sowing grain in humid or dewy soils was unavoidable, they should be sown alongside turnips, panic grass, millet and [[rape]].<ref>Cato, ''De Agricultura'', 6.1</ref>\n \nDespite listing [[panicum]] and millet among the [[legumes]] Columella says they should be considered grain crops \"for in many countries the peasants subsist on food made from them\".<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.9.17</ref>\n\n===Legumes===\nOf [[legumes]], Columella lists some that are preferred for cultivation: [[lentil]]s, [[pea]]s, ''[[lupinus]]'', [[bean]]s, [[cowpea]]s, and [[chickpea]]s (also listing [[sesame]], ''[[panicum]]'', [[cannabis]], [[barley]], and millet as legumes).<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.7.1</ref> \n\nHe writes the following about ''lupinus'':<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.10.1</ref>\n<blockquote>\"...it requires the least labour, costs least, and of all crops that are sown is most beneficial to the land. For it affords an excellent fertilizer for worn out vineyards and ploughlands; it flourishes even in exhausted soil; and it endures age when laid away in the granary. When softened by boiling it is good fodder for cattle during the winter; in the case of humans, too, it serves to warn off famine if years of crop failures come upon them.\"</blockquote>\n\n===Olives===\nThe Romans grew olive trees in poor, rocky soils, and often in areas with sparse precipitation.  The tree is sensitive to freezing temperatures and intolerant of the colder weather of northern Europe and high, cooler elevations. The olive was grown mostly near the Mediterranean Sea.  The consumption of olive oil provided about 12 percent of the calories and about 80 percent of necessary fats in the diet of the average Roman.<ref>James ''et al'', p. 169</ref>\n\n===Grapes===\nViticulture was probably brought to southern Italy and Sicily by Greek colonists, but the [[Phoenicia]]ns of [[Carthage]] in northern [[Africa]] gave the Romans much of their knowledge of growing grapes and making wine. By 160 BCE, the cultivation of grapes on large estates using slave labor was common in Italy and wine was becoming a universal drink in the Roman empire.  To protect their wine industry, the Romans attempted to prohibit the cultivation of grapes outside Italy,<ref>\"Wine and Rome\", [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/wine.html], accessed 15 Nov 2018</ref> but by the 1st century CE, provinces such as [[Spain]] and [[Gaul]] (modern day France) were exporting wine to Italy.<ref>Casson, Lionel (1991), ''The Ancient Mariners,'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, pl 200.</ref>\n\n===Fodder===\nColumella mentions [[turnips]] as important, high-yielding food crop, especially in [[Gaul]] where they were used as winter fodder for [[cattle]].<ref>Columella, De re Rustica, 2.10.22</ref> As other \"[[fodder]] crops\" he lists [[Medicago lupulina|Medic clover]], [[vetch]], barley, ''[[cytisus]]'', oats, chickpea and [[fenugreek]].<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.7.2</ref> Of Medic clover, he says it improves the soil, fattens lean cattle and is a high-yielding fodder crop.<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.10.25</ref> \n\n[[Cato the Elder]] wrote that leaves from [[Populus|poplar]], [[elm]] and [[oak]] leaves should be gathered in the Fall before they have dried completely and stored for use as fodder.

Liquids produced for market like oil and wine were stored on the ground floor and grain was stored in lofts with hay and other [[fodder]]. He instructs that granaries be well venilated, cool, with minimal humidity, to prolong freshness. He describes certain methods of construction to avoid buildings developing cracks that would give animals and [[weevils]] access to the grains.<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 1.6.9-1.6.17</ref>\n\nPress rooms, he advised, should be warm receiving light from the south to prevent the oil from freezing, which makes oil spoil faster. <ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 1.6.18</ref>\n\n==Land==\nColumella describes land as being classified into three types of terrain which he calls champaign (sloping [[plain]]s), hills with a gradual but gentle rise, and wooded, verdant mountain highlands. Of soil, he says there are six qualities: fat or lean, loose or compact, moist or dry. The permutations of these qualities producing many varieties of soils.<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.2.1-3</ref> Columella quotes [[Vergil]]'s comment that loose soil is \"what we rival when we [[plough]]\". Of the most preferred types of soil he says the best is fat and loose soil that is the least costly and most productive, then fat and dense which is productive though requiring more effort, and after these are the moist soils.<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.2.4-7</ref>\n\n==Farming practices==\n[[File:RomanHoeBlade.jpg|thumb|Roman hoe blade, from the [[Field Museum of Natural History|Field Museum in Chicago]]]]\nIn the 5th century BC, farms in Rome were small and family-owned. The [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] of this period, however, had started using [[crop rotation]] and had large estates. Rome's contact with [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], Greece, and the Hellenistic East in the 3rd and 2nd centuries improved Rome's agricultural methods. Roman agriculture reached its height in productivity and efficiency during the late Republic and early Empire.<ref>{{cite book |last=Howatson |first=M.

Small farms were from 18\u2013108 iugera. (One [[iugerum]] was equal to about 0.65 acres or a quarter of a hectare). Medium-sized farms were from 80\u2013500 iugera. Large estates (called ''[[Latifundium|latifundia]]'') were over 500 iugera.<ref name=\"White\">{{cite book |last=White |first=K.

Wealthy Romans bought land from peasant farmers who could no longer make a living. Starting in 200 BC, the [[Punic Wars]] called peasant farmers away to fight for longer periods of time.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cornell |first=Tim |year=1982 |title=Atlas of the Roman World |publisher=Facts on File |page=55 }}</ref> This is now disputed, some scholars now believe that large scale agriculture did not dominate Italian agriculture until the 1st century BC.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rosenstein |first1=Nathan |title=Rome at War |date=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Terranato |first1=Nicola |title=Republican Villas in the Suburbium of Rome in Roman Republican Villas |date=2012 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |pages=69\u201393}}</ref>\n\nCows provided milk while oxen and mules did the heavy work on the farm. Sheep and goats were cheese producers and were prized for their hides. Horses were not widely used in farming, but were raised by the rich for racing or war. Sugar production centered on beekeeping, and some Romans raised snails as luxury food.<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\nThe Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; tenant farming or [[sharecropping]] in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm's produce; forced labour by slaves owned by aristocrats and supervised by slave managers; and other arrangements in which a farm was leased to a tenant.<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\n[[Cato the Elder]] (also known as \"Cato the Censor\") was a politician and statesman in the mid-to-late Roman Republic and described his view of a farm of 100 iugera in the de agricultura. He claimed such a farm should have \"a foreman, a foreman's wife, ten laborers, one ox driver, one donkey driver, one man in charge of the willow grove, one swineherd, in all sixteen persons; two oxen, two donkeys for wagon work, one donkey for the mill work.\" He also said that such a farm should have \"three presses fully equipped, storage jars in which five vintages amounting to eight hundred cullei can be stored, twenty storage jars for wine-press refuse, twenty for grain, separate coverings for the jars, six fiber-covered half [[amphorae]], four fiber-covered amphorae, two funnels, three basketwork strainers, [and] three strainers to dip up the flower, ten jars for [handling] the wine juice...\"<ref name=\"Cato\"/> It is important to note that Cato's description is not indicative of the majority of farms in the early 2nd century BC. The de agricultura is a political document designed to show off Cato's character as much as it is a practical guide.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Read |first1=Brendon |title=Cato's de agricultura and the Spectacle of Expertise in Roman Republican Villas |date=2012 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |pages=61\u201368}}</ref>\n\n==Trade==\nThere was much commerce between the provinces of the empire, and all regions of the empire were largely economically interdependent. Some provinces specialized in the production of grains including wheat, emmer, spelt, barley, and millet; others in [[Ancient Rome and wine|wine]] and others in [[olive oil]], depending on the soil type. Columella writes in his ''Res Rustica'', \"Soil that is heavy, chalky, and wet is not unsuited to the growing for winter wheat and spelt. Barley tolerates no place except one that is loose and dry.\"<ref>Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella, ''On Agriculture (Res Rustica)'', (Loeb Classical Library), Book II, p. 145</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]] wrote extensively about agriculture in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' from books XII to XIX, including chapter XVIII, The Natural History of Grain.<ref name=\"tufts1\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+toc | title=Pliny the Elder, the Natural History, BOOK I}}</ref>\n\nGreek geographer [[Strabo]] considered the [[Po Valley]] (northern Italy) to be the most important economically because \"all cereals do well, but the yield from millet is exceptional, because the soil is so well watered.\" The province of [[Etruria]] had heavy soil good for wheat. Volcanic soil in [[Campania]] made it well-suited for wine production. In addition to knowledge of different soil categories, the Romans also took interest in what type of manure was best for the soil. The best was poultry manure, and cow manure one of the worst.  Sheep and goat manure were also good. Donkey manure was best for immediate use, while horse manure wasn't good for grain crops, but according to [[Marcus Terentius Varro]], it was very good for meadows because \"it promotes a heavy growth of grass plants like grass.\"<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\n==Economics==\nIn the grain-growing area of north Africa, centered on the ancient city of [[Carthage]], a family of six people needed to cultivate 12 [[Jugerum|iugera]]/ 3 [[hectares]] of land to meet minimum food requirements (without animals).<ref name=\"Kehoe, D 1988\">{{cite book |last=Kehoe |first=D. |year=1988 |title=Economics of Agriculture on Roman Imperial Estates in North Africa |location=G\u00f6ttingen |publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht |isbn=978-3525251881 }}</ref> If a family owned animals to help cultivate land, then 20 iugera was needed. More land would be required to meet subsistence levels if the family farmed as [[sharecropper]]s. In [[Africa Proconsularis]] in the 2nd century AD, one-third of the total crop went to the landowner as rent<ref name=\"Kehoe, D 1988\"/> (See [[Lex Manciana]]).\n\nSuch figures detail only the subsistence level. It is clear that large scale surplus production was undertaken in some provinces, such as to supply the cities, especially Rome, with grain, a process known as the [[Cura Annonae]].\n[[Egypt]], northern Africa, and [[Sicily]] were the principal sources of grain to feed the population of Rome, estimated at one million people at its peak.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rickman|first=G.E.|title=The Grain Trade Under the Roman Empire|journal=[[Memoirs from the American Academy in Rome]]|date=1980|volume=36|pages=263, 264}}.

Cicero indicates ''[[In Verrem]]'' a yield of 8:1 as normal, and 10:1 in exceptionally good harvest.  Paul Erdkamp mentions in his book ''The Grain Market in the Roman Empire'', that Columella was probably biased when he mentions a much lower yield of 4:1. According to Erdkamp, Columella wanted to make the point that \"grain offers little profit compared to wine. His argument induces him to exaggerate the profitability of vineyards and at the same time to diminish the yields that were obtained in grain cultivation. At best Columella provides a trustworthy figure for poor soils; at worst, his estimate is not reliable at all.\"{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nAverage wheat yields per year in the 3rd decade of the century, sowing 135&nbsp;kg/ha of seed, were around 1,200&nbsp;kg/ha in Italy and Sicily, 1,710&nbsp;kg/ha in Egypt, 269&nbsp;kg/ha in [[Cyrenaica]], Tunisia at 400&nbsp;kg/ha, and Algeria at 540&nbsp;kg/ha, Greece at 620&nbsp;kg/ha.<ref>Hopkins , K.

Mechanical devices aided agriculture and the production of food. For example, extensive sets of [[mill (grinding)|mill]]s existed in [[Gaul]] and [[Rome]] at an early date to grind wheat into flour. The most impressive extant remains occur at [[Barbegal]] in southern [[France]], near [[Arles]]. Sixteen overshot [[water wheel]]s arranged in two columns were fed by the main aqueduct to Arles, the outflow from one being the supply to the next one down in the series. The mills apparently operated from the end of the 1st century AD until about the end of the 3rd century.<ref>[http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/arles/ville.cfm?action=edifice_histoire&id=95 Ville d'Histoire et de Patrimoine<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206194648/http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/arles/ville.cfm?action=edifice_histoire&id=95 |date=2013-12-06 }}</ref> The capacity of the mills has been estimated at 4.5 tons of [[flour]] per day, sufficient to supply enough bread for the 12,500 inhabitants occupying the town of Arelate at that time.<ref>[http://www.etab.ac-caen.fr/lescourtils/provence/barbegal.htm La meunerie de Barbegal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nVertical [[water wheels]] were well known to the Romans, described by [[Vitruvius]] in his ''[[De Architectura]]'' of 25 BC, and mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''Naturalis Historia'' of AD 77. There are also later references to floating water mills from [[Byzantium]] and to [[sawmill]]s on the river [[Moselle]] by the poet [[Ausonius]]. The use of multiple stacked sequences of [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]s was widespread in Roman mines.\n\nThere is evidence from bas-reliefs that farmers in northern Gaul (present day France) used a kind of automatic [[combine harvester|harvester]] or [[reaper]] when collecting ripe grain crops. The machine, called the \"vallus\" or \"gallic vallus\", was apparently invented and used by the [[Treveri]]<ref>King, Anthony (1990), ''Roman Gaul and Germany.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 1001-101</ref> people. It cut the [[ear (botany)|ears]] of grain without the [[straw]] and was pushed by [[oxen]] or horses. Pliny the Elder mentions the device in the ''Naturalis Historia'' XVIII, 296. Possibly because the vallus was cumbersome and expensive, its adoption never became widespread and it fell into disuse after the 4th century CE.<ref>White, K.D. (2010), ''Agricultural Implements of the Roman World Reissue Edition,'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 160-171</ref> [[Scythe]]s and [[sickle]]s were the usual tools for harvesting crops.\n\n==Acquiring a farm==\n[[File:Roman harvester, Trier.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|[[Gallo-Roman]] harvesting machine]]\nAristocrats and common people could acquire land for a farm in one of three ways. The most common way to gain land was to [[land ownership|purchase the land]]. Though some [[plebians|lower class citizens]] did own small pieces of land, they often found it too difficult and expensive to maintain. Because of the many difficulties of owning land, they would sell it to someone in the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|aristocracy]] who had the financial backing to support a farm. Though there were some public lands available to the common person for use, aristocrats also tended to purchase those pieces of land, which caused a great deal of tension between the two classes. \u201cMass eviction of the poor by the rich underlay the political tensions and civil wars of the last century of the Roman Republic.\u201d<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  Another way to acquire land was as a reward for going to war. High ranking [[Roman legions|soldiers]] returning from war would often be given small pieces of public land or land in provinces as a way of paying them for their services. The last way to obtain land was through inheritance. A father could leave his land to his family, usually to his son, in the event of his death. Wills were drawn out that specified who would receive the land as a way of ensuring that other citizens did not try to take the land from the family of the deceased.\n\n==Aristocracy and the land==\n[[File:Marco Porcio Caton Major.jpg|thumb|upright|Cato the Elder, author of a book on Roman agriculture]]\n\nThough some small farms were owned by lower class citizens and soldiers, much of the land was controlled by the noble class of Rome. Land ownership was just one of many distinctions that set the aristocracy apart from the lower classes. Aristocracy would \"reorganize small holdings into larger more profitable farms in order to compete with other nobles.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  It was considered a point of pride to own not just the largest piece of land, but also to have land that grew high quality produce. As [[Marcus Cato]] wrote \"when they would praise a worthy man their praise took this form: 'Good husband good farmer'; it is from the farming class that the bravest men and the sturdiest soldiers come.\"<ref name=\"Cato-1\">[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/A*.html Marcus Cato, ''On Agriculture'', 1-2,5]</ref> The farms would produce a variety of crops depending on the season, and focused on trying to acquire the best possible farm under the best possible conditions. Cato discusses many of the primary focuses of the farmer and how to distinguish a great piece of land. He notes that a good farmer must take precious time to examine the land, looking over every detail. Not only did the land need to be perfect for purchase, but the neighbors must maintain their farms as well because \"if the district was good, they should be well kept.\" Individuals looking to buy a piece of land had to also take into consideration the weather of the area, the condition of the soil, and how close the farm would be to a town or port. Careful planning went into every detail of owning and maintaining a farm in Roman culture.<ref name=\"Cato-1\"/>\n\n==Running a farm in Rome==\nWhile the aristocracy owned most of the land in Rome, they often were not present at the farms. With obligations as senators, generals, and soldiers at war, many of the actual landowners spent very little time working on their farms. The farms instead were maintained by [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] and [[Freedman|freedmen]] paid to oversee those slaves.<ref name=\"Cato-1\"/> The overseer of the farm had many responsibilities that coincided with maintaining the land. He was responsible for ensuring that the slaves were kept busy and for resolving conflicts between them. An overseer had to be dependable and trustworthy in that the land owner had to know that the person he hired to run the farm was not going to try to steal any of the produce from the farm. Overseers were also responsible for ensuring that both servants and slaves were properly fed and housed, and that they were assigned work fairly and efficiently. They had to ensure that any orders given by the owner of the land were followed diligently and that everyone on the farm honored the [[Roman gods|gods]] completely and respectfully, which Romans believed was necessary to ensure a bountiful harvest. Good inscription evidence of how the system was organized is visible in the [[Lex Manciana]].\n\nThe majority of the work was done by servants and slaves. Slaves were the main source of labor. In Roman society, there were three main ways to obtain a slave. The first and possibly most common way to gain a slave was to [[Slave trade#Rome|buy one on the market]]. Slaves were purchased at auctions and slaves markets from dealers or were traded between individual slave owners. Another way slaves were acquired was through conquest in warfare. As [[Keith Hopkins]] explains in his writings, many landowners would go to war and bring back captives. These captives were then taken back to Roman territory and either sold to another citizen or made to work on the capturer's farm. The final way a slave could be obtained was through birth: if a female slave gave birth to a child, that child became property of the slave's owner. Extramarital relations with women who were not citizens was not considered to be [[adultery]] under [[Roman law]] (and Roman wives were expected to tolerate such behavior), so there was no legal or moral impediment to having children being fathered by a slave's owner or overseer.\n\nSlaves were relatively cheap to use because they were property;<ref>{{cite book |first=M.

Overseers motivated slaves by imposing punishments and by giving rewards. \"If the overseer sets his face against wrongdoing, they will not do it; if he allows it, the master must not let him go unpunished.\"<ref name=\"Cato-1\"/> Although outright cruelty to slaves was considered a mark of bad character in Roman culture, there were few limits on the punishments an overseer or slave-owner could inflict.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Problems for farmers==\nRoman farmers faced many of the problems which have historically affected farmers, including the unpredictability of weather, rainfall, and pests. Farmers also had to be wary of purchasing land too far away from a city or port because of war and land conflicts. As Rome was a vast empire that conquered many lands, it created enemies with individuals whose land had been taken. They would often lose their farms to the invaders who would take over and try to run the farms themselves.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Though Roman soldiers would often come to the aid of the farmers and try to regain the land, these fights often resulted in damaged or destroyed property. Land owners also faced problems with slave rebellions at times. \"In addition to invasions by Carthaginians and Celtic tribes, slaves rebellions and civil wars which were repeatedly fought on Italian soil all contributed to the destruction of traditional agricultural holdings.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> (pg. 4)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Agriculture in ancient Greece]]\n*[[Byzantine agriculture]]\n*[[History of agriculture]]\n*[[Roman technology]]\n*[[Deforestation during the Roman period]]\n*[[Grain supply to the city of Rome]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n===Modern sources===\n*Buck, Robert J.

From humble beginnings, the [[Roman Republic]] (509 BCE to 27 BCE) and [[Roman Empire|empire]] (27 BCE to 476 CE) expanded to rule much of [[Europe]], northern [[Africa]], and the [[Middle East]] and thus comprised many agricultural environments of which the [[Mediterranean climate]] of dry, hot summers and cool, rainy winters was the most common. Within the Mediterranean area, a triad of crops were most important: [[grain]]s, [[olive]]s, and [[Viticulture|grapes]].\n \nThe great majority of the people ruled by Rome were engaged in agriculture. From a beginning of small, largely self-sufficient landowners, rural society became dominated by [[latifundium]], large estates owned by the wealthy and utilizing mostly slave labor. The growth in the urban population, especially of the city of Rome, required the development of commercial markets and long-distance trade in agricultural products, especially grain, to supply the people in the cities with food.\n\n==The \"delightful\" life==\n\nAgriculture in ancient Rome was not only a necessity, but was idealized among the social elite as a way of life. [[Cicero]] considered farming the best of all Roman occupations. In his treatise ''[[De officiis|On Duties]]'', he declared that \"of all the occupations by which gain is secured, none is better than agriculture, none more profitable, none more delightful, none more becoming to a free man.\" When one of his clients was derided in court for preferring a rural lifestyle, Cicero defended country life as \"the teacher of economy, of industry, and of justice\" (parsimonia, diligentia, iustitia).<ref>''[[Pro Roscio Amerino]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0018%3Atext%3DS.%20Rosc.%3Asection%3D75 75.]</ref> [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], [[Columella]], [[Varro]] and [[Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]] wrote handbooks on farming practice.\n\nIn his treatise ''[[De Agri Cultura|De agricultura]]'' (\"On Farming\", 2nd century BC), Cato wrote that the best farms contained a [[Ancient Rome and wine|vineyard]], followed by an irrigated garden, willow plantation, olive orchard, meadow, grain land, forest trees, vineyard trained on trees, and lastly acorn woodlands.<ref name=\"Cato\">Cato the Censor, Columbia University Records of Civilization: On Farming, translated by Ernest Brehaut (Columbia University Press)</ref> Though Rome relied on resources from its many [[Roman province|provinces]] acquired through conquest and warfare, wealthy Romans developed the land in Italy to produce a variety of crops. \"The people living in the city of Rome constituted a huge market for the purchase of food produced on Italian farms.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite book |last=Hopkins |title=Conquerors and Slaves |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=1\u20139 |year=1978 |isbn=978-0521219457 }}</ref>\n\nLand ownership was a dominant factor in distinguishing the aristocracy from the common person, and the more land a Roman owned, the more important he would be in the city. Soldiers were often rewarded with land from the commander they served. Though farms depended on slave labor, free men and citizens were hired at farms to oversee the slaves and ensure that the farms ran smoothly.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n==Crops==\n===Grains===\nStaple crops in early Rome were [[millet]], and [[emmer]] and [[spelt]] which are species of wheat.  According to the Roman scholar [[Varro]], [[common wheat]] and [[durum wheat]] were introduced to [[Italy]] as crops about 450 BCE.<ref>Fussell, G. E.

Wheat was the preferred grain, but barley was widely eaten and also important as animal feed.<ref>Jasy, Naum (1950), \"The daily bread of the Ancient Greeks and Romans,\" ''Ostria,'', Vol. 9, pp. 231-233. Downloaded from [[JSTOR]].</ref>\n\nIn ''De re Rustica'' [[Columella]] wrote that emmer was more resistant to moisture than wheat. According to Columella four types of emmer were cultivated, including one variety that he calls Clusian (named for the town [[Clusium]]).<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.6.3-4</ref> Cato wrote that if sowing grain in humid or dewy soils was unavoidable, they should be sown alongside turnips, panic grass, millet and [[rape]].<ref>Cato, ''De Agricultura'', 6.1</ref>\n \nDespite listing [[panicum]] and millet among the [[legumes]] Columella says they should be considered grain crops \"for in many countries the peasants subsist on food made from them\".<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.9.17</ref>\n\n===Legumes===\nOf [[legumes]], Columella lists some that are preferred for cultivation: [[lentil]]s, [[pea]]s, ''[[lupinus]]'', [[bean]]s, [[cowpea]]s, and [[chickpea]]s (also listing [[sesame]], ''[[panicum]]'', [[cannabis]], [[barley]], and millet as legumes).<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.7.1</ref> \n\nHe writes the following about ''lupinus'':<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.10.1</ref>\n<blockquote>\"...it requires the least labour, costs least, and of all crops that are sown is most beneficial to the land. For it affords an excellent fertilizer for worn out vineyards and ploughlands; it flourishes even in exhausted soil; and it endures age when laid away in the granary. When softened by boiling it is good fodder for cattle during the winter; in the case of humans, too, it serves to warn off famine if years of crop failures come upon them.\"</blockquote>\n\n===Olives===\nThe Romans grew olive trees in poor, rocky soils, and often in areas with sparse precipitation.  The tree is sensitive to freezing temperatures and intolerant of the colder weather of northern Europe and high, cooler elevations. The olive was grown mostly near the Mediterranean Sea.  The consumption of olive oil provided about 12 percent of the calories and about 80 percent of necessary fats in the diet of the average Roman.<ref>James ''et al'', p. 169</ref>\n\n===Grapes===\nViticulture was probably brought to southern Italy and Sicily by Greek colonists, but the [[Phoenicia]]ns of [[Carthage]] in northern [[Africa]] gave the Romans much of their knowledge of growing grapes and making wine. By 160 BCE, the cultivation of grapes on large estates using slave labor was common in Italy and wine was becoming a universal drink in the Roman empire.  To protect their wine industry, the Romans attempted to prohibit the cultivation of grapes outside Italy,<ref>\"Wine and Rome\", [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/wine.html], accessed 15 Nov 2018</ref> but by the 1st century CE, provinces such as [[Spain]] and [[Gaul]] (modern day France) were exporting wine to Italy.<ref>Casson, Lionel (1991), ''The Ancient Mariners,'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, pl 200.</ref>\n\n===Fodder===\nColumella mentions [[turnips]] as important, high-yielding food crop, especially in [[Gaul]] where they were used as winter fodder for [[cattle]].<ref>Columella, De re Rustica, 2.10.22</ref> As other \"[[fodder]] crops\" he lists [[Medicago lupulina|Medic clover]], [[vetch]], barley, ''[[cytisus]]'', oats, chickpea and [[fenugreek]].<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.7.2</ref> Of Medic clover, he says it improves the soil, fattens lean cattle and is a high-yielding fodder crop.<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.10.25</ref> \n\n[[Cato the Elder]] wrote that leaves from [[Populus|poplar]], [[elm]] and [[oak]] leaves should be gathered in the Fall before they have dried completely and stored for use as fodder.

Liquids produced for market like oil and wine were stored on the ground floor and grain was stored in lofts with hay and other [[fodder]]. He instructs that granaries be well venilated, cool, with minimal humidity, to prolong freshness. He describes certain methods of construction to avoid buildings developing cracks that would give animals and [[weevils]] access to the grains.<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 1.6.9-1.6.17</ref>\n\nPress rooms, he advised, should be warm receiving light from the south to prevent the oil from freezing, which makes oil spoil faster. <ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 1.6.18</ref>\n\n==Land==\nColumella describes land as being classified into three types of terrain which he calls champaign (sloping [[plain]]s), hills with a gradual but gentle rise, and wooded, verdant mountain highlands. Of soil, he says there are six qualities: fat or lean, loose or compact, moist or dry. The permutations of these qualities producing many varieties of soils.<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.2.1-3</ref> Columella quotes [[Vergil]]'s comment that loose soil is \"what we rival when we [[plough]]\". Of the most preferred types of soil he says the best is fat and loose soil that is the least costly and most productive, then fat and dense which is productive though requiring more effort, and after these are the moist soils.<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.2.4-7</ref>\n\n==Farming practices==\n[[File:RomanHoeBlade.jpg|thumb|Roman hoe blade, from the [[Field Museum of Natural History|Field Museum in Chicago]]]]\nIn the 5th century BC, farms in Rome were small and family-owned. The [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] of this period, however, had started using [[crop rotation]] and had large estates. Rome's contact with [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], Greece, and the Hellenistic East in the 3rd and 2nd centuries improved Rome's agricultural methods. Roman agriculture reached its height in productivity and efficiency during the late Republic and early Empire.<ref>{{cite book |last=Howatson |first=M.

Small farms were from 18\u2013108 iugera. (One [[iugerum]] was equal to about 0.65 acres or a quarter of a hectare). Medium-sized farms were from 80\u2013500 iugera.

Sheep and goats were cheese producers and were prized for their hides. Horses were not widely used in farming, but were raised by the rich for racing or war. Sugar production centered on beekeeping, and some Romans raised snails as luxury food.<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\nThe Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; tenant farming or [[sharecropping]] in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm's produce; forced labour by slaves owned by aristocrats and supervised by slave managers; and other arrangements in which a farm was leased to a tenant.<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\n[[Cato the Elder]] (also known as \"Cato the Censor\") was a politician and statesman in the mid-to-late Roman Republic and described his view of a farm of 100 iugera in the de agricultura. He claimed such a farm should have \"a foreman, a foreman's wife, ten laborers, one ox driver, one donkey driver, one man in charge of the willow grove, one swineherd, in all sixteen persons; two oxen, two donkeys for wagon work, one donkey for the mill work.\" He also said that such a farm should have \"three presses fully equipped, storage jars in which five vintages amounting to eight hundred cullei can be stored, twenty storage jars for wine-press refuse, twenty for grain, separate coverings for the jars, six fiber-covered half [[amphorae]], four fiber-covered amphorae, two funnels, three basketwork strainers, [and] three strainers to dip up the flower, ten jars for [handling] the wine juice...\"<ref name=\"Cato\"/> It is important to note that Cato's description is not indicative of the majority of farms in the early 2nd century BC.

Some provinces specialized in the production of grains including wheat, emmer, spelt, barley, and millet; others in [[Ancient Rome and wine|wine]] and others in [[olive oil]], depending on the soil type. Columella writes in his ''Res Rustica'', \"Soil that is heavy, chalky, and wet is not unsuited to the growing for winter wheat and spelt. Barley tolerates no place except one that is loose and dry.\"<ref>Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella, ''On Agriculture (Res Rustica)'', (Loeb Classical Library), Book II, p. 145</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]] wrote extensively about agriculture in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' from books XII to XIX, including chapter XVIII, The Natural History of Grain.<ref name=\"tufts1\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+toc | title=Pliny the Elder, the Natural History, BOOK I}}</ref>\n\nGreek geographer [[Strabo]] considered the [[Po Valley]] (northern Italy) to be the most important economically because \"all cereals do well, but the yield from millet is exceptional, because the soil is so well watered.\" The province of [[Etruria]] had heavy soil good for wheat. Volcanic soil in [[Campania]] made it well-suited for wine production. In addition to knowledge of different soil categories, the Romans also took interest in what type of manure was best for the soil. The best was poultry manure, and cow manure one of the worst.  Sheep and goat manure were also good. Donkey manure was best for immediate use, while horse manure wasn't good for grain crops, but according to [[Marcus Terentius Varro]], it was very good for meadows because \"it promotes a heavy growth of grass plants like grass.\"<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\n==Economics==\nIn the grain-growing area of north Africa, centered on the ancient city of [[Carthage]], a family of six people needed to cultivate 12 [[Jugerum|iugera]]/ 3 [[hectares]] of land to meet minimum food requirements (without animals).<ref name=\"Kehoe, D 1988\">{{cite book |last=Kehoe |first=D. |year=1988 |title=Economics of Agriculture on Roman Imperial Estates in North Africa |location=G\u00f6ttingen |publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht |isbn=978-3525251881 }}</ref> If a family owned animals to help cultivate land, then 20 iugera was needed.

It is clear that large scale surplus production was undertaken in some provinces, such as to supply the cities, especially Rome, with grain, a process known as the [[Cura Annonae]].\n[[Egypt]], northern Africa, and [[Sicily]] were the principal sources of grain to feed the population of Rome, estimated at one million people at its peak.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rickman|first=G.E.|title=The Grain Trade Under the Roman Empire|journal=[[Memoirs from the American Academy in Rome]]|date=1980|volume=36|pages=263, 264}}.

According to Erdkamp, Columella wanted to make the point that \"grain offers little profit compared to wine.

Mechanical devices aided agriculture and the production of food. For example, extensive sets of [[mill (grinding)|mill]]s existed in [[Gaul]] and [[Rome]] at an early date to grind wheat into flour. The most impressive extant remains occur at [[Barbegal]] in southern [[France]], near [[Arles]]. Sixteen overshot [[water wheel]]s arranged in two columns were fed by the main aqueduct to Arles, the outflow from one being the supply to the next one down in the series. The mills apparently operated from the end of the 1st century AD until about the end of the 3rd century.<ref>[http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/arles/ville.cfm?action=edifice_histoire&id=95 Ville d'Histoire et de Patrimoine<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206194648/http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/arles/ville.cfm?action=edifice_histoire&id=95 |date=2013-12-06 }}</ref> The capacity of the mills has been estimated at 4.5 tons of [[flour]] per day, sufficient to supply enough bread for the 12,500 inhabitants occupying the town of Arelate at that time.<ref>[http://www.etab.ac-caen.fr/lescourtils/provence/barbegal.htm La meunerie de Barbegal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nVertical [[water wheels]] were well known to the Romans, described by [[Vitruvius]] in his ''[[De Architectura]]'' of 25 BC, and mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''Naturalis Historia'' of AD 77. There are also later references to floating water mills from [[Byzantium]] and to [[sawmill]]s on the river [[Moselle]] by the poet [[Ausonius]]. The use of multiple stacked sequences of [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]s was widespread in Roman mines.\n\nThere is evidence from bas-reliefs that farmers in northern Gaul (present day France) used a kind of automatic [[combine harvester|harvester]] or [[reaper]] when collecting ripe grain crops. The machine, called the \"vallus\" or \"gallic vallus\", was apparently invented and used by the [[Treveri]]<ref>King, Anthony (1990), ''Roman Gaul and Germany.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 1001-101</ref> people. It cut the [[ear (botany)|ears]] of grain without the [[straw]] and was pushed by [[oxen]] or horses. Pliny the Elder mentions the device in the ''Naturalis Historia'' XVIII, 296. Possibly because the vallus was cumbersome and expensive, its adoption never became widespread and it fell into disuse after the 4th century CE.<ref>White, K.D. (2010), ''Agricultural Implements of the Roman World Reissue Edition,'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 160-171</ref> [[Scythe]]s and [[sickle]]s were the usual tools for harvesting crops.\n\n==Acquiring a farm==\n[[File:Roman harvester, Trier.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|[[Gallo-Roman]] harvesting machine]]\nAristocrats and common people could acquire land for a farm in one of three ways. The most common way to gain land was to [[land ownership|purchase the land]]. Though some [[plebians|lower class citizens]] did own small pieces of land, they often found it too difficult and expensive to maintain. Because of the many difficulties of owning land, they would sell it to someone in the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|aristocracy]] who had the financial backing to support a farm. Though there were some public lands available to the common person for use, aristocrats also tended to purchase those pieces of land, which caused a great deal of tension between the two classes. \u201cMass eviction of the poor by the rich underlay the political tensions and civil wars of the last century of the Roman Republic.\u201d<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  Another way to acquire land was as a reward for going to war. High ranking [[Roman legions|soldiers]] returning from war would often be given small pieces of public land or land in provinces as a way of paying them for their services. The last way to obtain land was through inheritance. A father could leave his land to his family, usually to his son, in the event of his death. Wills were drawn out that specified who would receive the land as a way of ensuring that other citizens did not try to take the land from the family of the deceased.\n\n==Aristocracy and the land==\n[[File:Marco Porcio Caton Major.jpg|thumb|upright|Cato the Elder, author of a book on Roman agriculture]]\n\nThough some small farms were owned by lower class citizens and soldiers, much of the land was controlled by the noble class of Rome. Land ownership was just one of many distinctions that set the aristocracy apart from the lower classes. Aristocracy would \"reorganize small holdings into larger more profitable farms in order to compete with other nobles.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  It was considered a point of pride to own not just the largest piece of land, but also to have land that grew high quality produce. As [[Marcus Cato]] wrote \"when they would praise a worthy man their praise took this form: 'Good husband good farmer'; it is from the farming class that the bravest men and the sturdiest soldiers come.\"<ref name=\"Cato-1\">[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/A*.html Marcus Cato, ''On Agriculture'', 1-2,5]</ref> The farms would produce a variety of crops depending on the season, and focused on trying to acquire the best possible farm under the best possible conditions. Cato discusses many of the primary focuses of the farmer and how to distinguish a great piece of land. He notes that a good farmer must take precious time to examine the land, looking over every detail. Not only did the land need to be perfect for purchase, but the neighbors must maintain their farms as well because \"if the district was good, they should be well kept.\" Individuals looking to buy a piece of land had to also take into consideration the weather of the area, the condition of the soil, and how close the farm would be to a town or port. Careful planning went into every detail of owning and maintaining a farm in Roman culture.<ref name=\"Cato-1\"/>\n\n==Running a farm in Rome==\nWhile the aristocracy owned most of the land in Rome, they often were not present at the farms. With obligations as senators, generals, and soldiers at war, many of the actual landowners spent very little time working on their farms. The farms instead were maintained by [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] and [[Freedman|freedmen]] paid to oversee those slaves.<ref name=\"Cato-1\"/> The overseer of the farm had many responsibilities that coincided with maintaining the land. He was responsible for ensuring that the slaves were kept busy and for resolving conflicts between them. An overseer had to be dependable and trustworthy in that the land owner had to know that the person he hired to run the farm was not going to try to steal any of the produce from the farm. Overseers were also responsible for ensuring that both servants and slaves were properly fed and housed, and that they were assigned work fairly and efficiently. They had to ensure that any orders given by the owner of the land were followed diligently and that everyone on the farm honored the [[Roman gods|gods]] completely and respectfully, which Romans believed was necessary to ensure a bountiful harvest. Good inscription evidence of how the system was organized is visible in the [[Lex Manciana]].\n\nThe majority of the work was done by servants and slaves. Slaves were the main source of labor. In Roman society, there were three main ways to obtain a slave. The first and possibly most common way to gain a slave was to [[Slave trade#Rome|buy one on the market]]. Slaves were purchased at auctions and slaves markets from dealers or were traded between individual slave owners. Another way slaves were acquired was through conquest in warfare. As [[Keith Hopkins]] explains in his writings, many landowners would go to war and bring back captives. These captives were then taken back to Roman territory and either sold to another citizen or made to work on the capturer's farm. The final way a slave could be obtained was through birth: if a female slave gave birth to a child, that child became property of the slave's owner. Extramarital relations with women who were not citizens was not considered to be [[adultery]] under [[Roman law]] (and Roman wives were expected to tolerate such behavior), so there was no legal or moral impediment to having children being fathered by a slave's owner or overseer.\n\nSlaves were relatively cheap to use because they were property;<ref>{{cite book |first=M. I. |last=Finley |quote=a slave is property, subject to the rules and procedures of property, with respect to sale, lease, theft, natural increase and so on. |title=The Ancient Economy |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_oMmyO465s9oC |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California |year=1973 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_oMmyO465s9oC/page/n57 62] |isbn=978-0520024366 }}</ref> their treatment depended on the humanity of their owners, who met the needs of their slaves on what they cared to spend, not what they had to. Overseers motivated slaves by imposing punishments and by giving rewards. \"If the overseer sets his face against wrongdoing, they will not do it; if he allows it, the master must not let him go unpunished.\"<ref name=\"Cato-1\"/> Although outright cruelty to slaves was considered a mark of bad character in Roman culture, there were few limits on the punishments an overseer or slave-owner could inflict.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Problems for farmers==\nRoman farmers faced many of the problems which have historically affected farmers, including the unpredictability of weather, rainfall, and pests. Farmers also had to be wary of purchasing land too far away from a city or port because of war and land conflicts. As Rome was a vast empire that conquered many lands, it created enemies with individuals whose land had been taken. They would often lose their farms to the invaders who would take over and try to run the farms themselves.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Though Roman soldiers would often come to the aid of the farmers and try to regain the land, these fights often resulted in damaged or destroyed property. Land owners also faced problems with slave rebellions at times. \"In addition to invasions by Carthaginians and Celtic tribes, slaves rebellions and civil wars which were repeatedly fought on Italian soil all contributed to the destruction of traditional agricultural holdings.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> (pg. 4)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Agriculture in ancient Greece]]\n*[[Byzantine agriculture]]\n*[[History of agriculture]]\n*[[Roman technology]]\n*[[Deforestation during the Roman period]]\n*[[Grain supply to the city of Rome]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n===Modern sources===\n*Buck, Robert J.
