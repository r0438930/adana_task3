Enjoying initial success in the first few days, Hantz grew frustrated of the laid-back mentality from his fellow tribe-mates and began actively searching for, and locating, a [[Survivor (franchise)#Hidden immunity idols|Hidden Immunity Idol]]. Wanting to cause paranoia, Hantz announced his intention to play the hidden immunity idol at their first Tribal Council. During this time he formed allegiances with Samuel Hinton, [[Monika Radulovic]] and Damien Thomlinson. After losing the second Immunity Challenge, Hantz attempted to orchestrate a split vote between Jackie Glazier and [[Shane Gould]] but a counter-alliance led by [[Moana Hope]] forced a tie in the event Hantz' hidden immunity idol was played. At Tribal Council, Hantz did not play his hidden immunity idol leading to a revote between himself and Glazier. At the revote, Thomlinson stayed loyal to Hantz with the rest of the vote eliminating him in a unanimous decision. He finished in 23rd place.\n\n===Information leaks===\nIn 2011, Hantz was accused of violating his ''Survivor'' contract by leaking information regarding the show's results. Late in the previous year, a man named Jim Early was sued by [[executive producer]] and ''Survivor'' creator [[Mark Burnett]]'s DJB Inc., for successfully spoiling ''Survivor: Samoa'' and ''Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains'' on a ''Survivor'' [[fansite]] known as ''Survivor Sucks''. The lawsuit accused Early of \"misappropriation of trade secrets\u201d and \"tortious interference with contract.\" The charges were dropped on January 13, 2011, after Early provided to an attorney an email, which allegedly confirmed Hantz as source of the spoilers. Early claims that he had originally made contact with Hantz via telephone to warn him that someone had posted his private information online, but that Hantz had recontacted him later and begun revealing accurate information about the show's outcome, which Early posted to the fansite. Thus far, no legal action has been taken against Hantz, although contestants who reveal information regarding a season's results may face [[liquidated damages]] of $5 million.<ref name=\"Survivor Spy\" /> In an interview with ''[[USA today]]'', Hantz denied the accusations, commenting, \"See, that's another thing. I am the villain, and its unfair that people perceive me that way, and they throw out things that's not fair to me or my family, and I guess I got to deal with it. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to comment on this or not, but it is 100% false.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2011-02-15-survivor15_ST_N.htm | title = Russell, Rob fight for redemption in new 'Survivor' | first = Lindsay | last = Deutsch | date = February 14, 2011 | accessdate =September 22, 2013 | work = [[USA Today]] }}</ref>\n\n==Other television appearances==\nOn February 10, 2010, Hantz and ten other contestants from ''Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains'' made a special appearance on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' to present the show's Top Ten List.<ref>{{cite web|last=Floyd|first=Nancy|title=Survivor: Heroes Vs.

Enjoying initial success in the first few days, Hantz grew frustrated of the laid-back mentality from his fellow tribe-mates and began actively searching for, and locating, a [[Survivor (franchise)#Hidden immunity idols|Hidden Immunity Idol]]. Wanting to cause paranoia, Hantz announced his intention to play the hidden immunity idol at their first Tribal Council. During this time he formed allegiances with Samuel Hinton, [[Monika Radulovic]] and Damien Thomlinson. After losing the second Immunity Challenge, Hantz attempted to orchestrate a split vote between Jackie Glazier and [[Shane Gould]] but a counter-alliance led by [[Moana Hope]] forced a tie in the event Hantz' hidden immunity idol was played. At Tribal Council, Hantz did not play his hidden immunity idol leading to a revote between himself and Glazier. At the revote, Thomlinson stayed loyal to Hantz with the rest of the vote eliminating him in a unanimous decision. He finished in 23rd place.\n\n===Information leaks===\nIn 2011, Hantz was accused of violating his ''Survivor'' contract by leaking information regarding the show's results. Late in the previous year, a man named Jim Early was sued by [[executive producer]] and ''Survivor'' creator [[Mark Burnett]]'s DJB Inc., for successfully spoiling ''Survivor: Samoa'' and ''Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains'' on a ''Survivor'' [[fansite]] known as ''Survivor Sucks''. The lawsuit accused Early of \"misappropriation of trade secrets\u201d and \"tortious interference with contract.\" The charges were dropped on January 13, 2011, after Early provided to an attorney an email, which allegedly confirmed Hantz as source of the spoilers. Early claims that he had originally made contact with Hantz via telephone to warn him that someone had posted his private information online, but that Hantz had recontacted him later and begun revealing accurate information about the show's outcome, which Early posted to the fansite. Thus far, no legal action has been taken against Hantz, although contestants who reveal information regarding a season's results may face [[liquidated damages]] of $5 million.<ref name=\"Survivor Spy\" /> In an interview with ''[[USA today]]'', Hantz denied the accusations, commenting, \"See, that's another thing. I am the villain, and its unfair that people perceive me that way, and they throw out things that's not fair to me or my family, and I guess I got to deal with it. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to comment on this or not, but it is 100% false.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2011-02-15-survivor15_ST_N.htm | title = Russell, Rob fight for redemption in new 'Survivor' | first = Lindsay | last = Deutsch | date = February 14, 2011 | accessdate =September 22, 2013 | work = [[USA Today]] }}</ref>\n\n==Other television appearances==\nOn February 10, 2010, Hantz and ten other contestants from ''Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains'' made a special appearance on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' to present the show's Top Ten List.<ref>{{cite web|last=Floyd|first=Nancy|title=Survivor: Heroes Vs.
