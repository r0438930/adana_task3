After this, the Australians were withdrawn from the line for rest and further reorganisation and they did not see further action until the war ended in November 1918.{{sfn|Blair|1989|p=5}} During the fighting, the battalion suffered 650 killed in action or died on active service, and 1,438 wounded.

Further periods of continuous service were undertaken between December 1940 and April 1941, and between August and October 1941 at Nagambie Road.{{sfn|Blair|1989|pp=92, 125 & 148}}\n\nFollowing Japan's entry into the war in December 1941, the battalion was mobilised for war service.{{sfn|Blair|1989|p=148}} In early 1942, when concerns about a Japanese invasion of Australia heightened, the battalion, consisting of 44 officers and 890 other ranks, was moved to Jimboomba, in Queensland, from Bonegilla.{{sfn|Blair|1989|p=178}} The invasion did not eventuate and the government decided to demobilise part of the military to rectify a manpower shortage that developed in the Australian economy.{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=184}} As a result, on 27 August 1942, the 52nd Battalion was once again amalgamated with the 37th Battalion to form the 37th/52nd Battalion,{{sfn|Festberg|1972|p=110}} and some of its personnel were released back to civilian industry.
