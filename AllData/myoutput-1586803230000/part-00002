Swift wrote and produced the song with [[Joel Little]]. It is a [[synth-pop]] song which features flashy harmonies and murky synths. Over an uptempo production, Swift imagines the media's treatment of her if she were a man. The song received acclaim from critics, who praised its [[feminism|feminist]] message.\n\n\"The Man\" peaked at number 23 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the fourth consecutive single from ''Lover'' to peak inside the top 40 of the chart.

The video presents numerous prevalent examples of double standards in society, and comments on the [[Sexual objectification|objectification]] and [[Sexualization|sexualization of women]], [[toxic masculinity]], [[patriarchy]], as well as performative allyship. Throughout the video, the male version of Swift is seen rudely inconveniencing the people around him, leading a luxurious and promiscuous lifestyle, [[manspreading]], receiving praise for the bare minimum, and throwing [[tantrum]]s without consequences. It contains visual references to ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'', a film involving the lyrically name-checked actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and cinematographer Prieto, and tennis player [[Serena Williams]]' match controversy with a chair umpire at the [[2018 US Open (tennis)|2018 US Open Championships]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Tyler Swift manspreading.jpeg|thumb|Swift's male alter-ego, Tyler Swift (in the middle), [[manspreading]] in a metro train.|alt=Man smiling]]\n\nThe video has several easter eggs alluding to Swift's other work, including ''[[Speak Now]]'', ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'', ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' and ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' graffiti on a wall. ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' is written backwards, while the title of her [[Taylor Swift (album)|eponymous debut album]] appears in a sign saying \"Missing: If Found Return to Taylor Swift\". The \"missing\" sign, along with another wordless sign that appears to ban riding [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]], references her battle with [[Scooter Braun]] and [[Big Machine Records]] over the ownership of the master recordings of her first six studio albums. ''Lover'', the first album that Swift completely owns herself, is absent, but the word \"karma\" is written twice on the wall, a possible reference to Swift's plan to re-record her previous works thus lowering the value of the originals. The camera subsequently pans over a \"Mr. Americana\" poster for a film starring Tyler Swift, directed by Larry Wilson, and premiering at the 2020 Mandance Festival, a [[word play]] on Swift's [[Netflix]] documentary ''[[Miss Americana]]'' directed by [[Lana Wilson]], which debuted at the [[2020 Sundance Film Festival]]. Swift's alter-ego runs down a hallway giving high-fives to nineteen disembodied hands, alluding to double standards behind the [[walk of shame]] that women are often forced to take after a sexual encounter. The hands are said to be a reference to the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th amendment of the United States constitution]], which granted women the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|right to vote]] in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/taylor-swift-the-man-music-video-hidden-details|title=Taylor Swift Just Unveiled Her Self-Directed Music Video For \"The Man\" And It's Full Of Hidden Details|last=Bate|first=Ellie|website=BuzzFeed|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the final scene, Swift herself appears as the video's director to instruct her male alter-ego to be both \"sexier\" and \"more likeable\" in the next take\u2014a subtle dig at the entertainment industry's blatant objectification of and sexist treatment toward women.

The song was serviced to US [[Hot adult contemporary|adult contemporary]] and [[Contemporary hit radio|pop]] radio formats on January 27 and 28, 2020 as the fourth single from Swift's seventh studio album, ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019)''.'' Swift wrote and produced the song with [[Joel Little]]. It is a [[synth-pop]] song which features flashy harmonies and murky synths. Over an uptempo production, Swift imagines the media's treatment of her if she were a man. The song received acclaim from critics, who praised its [[feminism|feminist]] message.\n\n\"The Man\" peaked at number 23 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the fourth consecutive single from ''Lover'' to peak inside the top 40 of the chart. It also debuted at number 4 on the [[Rolling Stone Top 100|''Rolling Stone'' Top 100]]. It entered the top 40 on charts in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Slovakia and the United Kingdom. On February 7, 2020, an animated lyric video of the song was released on [[YouTube]]. On February 18, 2020, a live acoustic version of the song, titled \"The Man (Live from Paris)\", was released on all music platforms, accompanied by its live video.\n\nAn official music video for \"The Man\" was released on February 27, 2020 and was directed by Swift herself, marking her solo directorial debut. The [[Satire|satirical]] video sees Swift in her theoretical male alter-ego named \"Tyler Swift\", presenting several prevalent examples of [[Sexism|sexist]] double standards in society, including [[Sexual objectification|objectification]], [[Sexualization|sexualization of women]], [[toxic masculinity]] and [[patriarchy]].\n\n==Background and composition==\n[[File:Leonardo DiCaprio 2014.jpg|thumb|upright| American actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] is name-checked in the lyrics of the song, whose films, ''[[Inception]]'' and ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'', are further referenced in its lyric video and music video, respectively.|alt=Leonardo DiCaprio attending a film premiere]]The recording process for [[Taylor Swift]]'s seventh studio album ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' took under three months, and concluded in February 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last=Suskind |first=Alex |title=New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7, fan theories, and her next era |url=https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/ |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=September 1, 2019 |date=May 9, 2019}}</ref> [[Joel Little]] was revealed as one of the producers for the album with the release of lead single \"[[Me!]]\" in April.

The video presents numerous prevalent examples of double standards in society, and comments on the [[Sexual objectification|objectification]] and [[Sexualization|sexualization of women]], [[toxic masculinity]], [[patriarchy]], as well as performative allyship. Throughout the video, the male version of Swift is seen rudely inconveniencing the people around him, leading a luxurious and promiscuous lifestyle, [[manspreading]], receiving praise for the bare minimum, and throwing [[tantrum]]s without consequences. It contains visual references to ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'', a film involving the lyrically name-checked actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and cinematographer Prieto, and tennis player [[Serena Williams]]' match controversy with a chair umpire at the [[2018 US Open (tennis)|2018 US Open Championships]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Tyler Swift manspreading.jpeg|thumb|Swift's male alter-ego, Tyler Swift (in the middle), [[manspreading]] in a metro train.|alt=Man smiling]]\n\nThe video has several easter eggs alluding to Swift's other work, including ''[[Speak Now]]'', ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'', ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' and ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' graffiti on a wall. ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' is written backwards, while the title of her [[Taylor Swift (album)|eponymous debut album]] appears in a sign saying \"Missing: If Found Return to Taylor Swift\". The \"missing\" sign, along with another wordless sign that appears to ban riding [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]], references her battle with [[Scooter Braun]] and [[Big Machine Records]] over the ownership of the master recordings of her first six studio albums. ''Lover'', the first album that Swift completely owns herself, is absent, but the word \"karma\" is written twice on the wall, a possible reference to Swift's plan to re-record her previous works thus lowering the value of the originals. The camera subsequently pans over a \"Mr. Americana\" poster for a film starring Tyler Swift, directed by Larry Wilson, and premiering at the 2020 Mandance Festival, a [[word play]] on Swift's [[Netflix]] documentary ''[[Miss Americana]]'' directed by [[Lana Wilson]], which debuted at the [[2020 Sundance Film Festival]]. Swift's alter-ego runs down a hallway giving high-fives to nineteen disembodied hands, alluding to double standards behind the [[walk of shame]] that women are often forced to take after a sexual encounter. The hands are said to be a reference to the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th amendment of the United States constitution]], which granted women the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|right to vote]] in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/taylor-swift-the-man-music-video-hidden-details|title=Taylor Swift Just Unveiled Her Self-Directed Music Video For \"The Man\" And It's Full Of Hidden Details|last=Bate|first=Ellie|website=BuzzFeed|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the final scene, Swift herself appears as the video's director to instruct her male alter-ego to be both \"sexier\" and \"more likeable\" in the next take\u2014a subtle dig at the entertainment industry's blatant objectification of and sexist treatment toward women. Ending on messages of female empowerment, Swift then turns to praise Loren Gray for her acting performance as a tennis [[ball boy|ball girl]], despite her role consisting of nothing more than an [[eye-rolling|eye roll]]. The end credits list Swift as the director, writer, owner and star of the music video, Johnson as the voice of \"The Man\", and shows photos of Swift's transformation process into the male lead of the video.
