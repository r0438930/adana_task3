The Eastern Highlands extend north and south for about {{convert|300|km|mi}} through Zimbabwe's [[Manicaland Province]] and Mozambique's [[Manica Province]].<ref name=\"EnZim\">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Zimbabwe|publisher=Arlington Business Corporation|location=Worcester|date=1989|edition=2nd|isbn=0-9514505-0-6}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe highlands consist of three main mountain groups \u2013 The Nyanga, Bvumba, and Chimanimani mountains - and several smaller ranges. The mountains are mostly sparsely populated, covered in rich grasslands, shrublands, woodlands and forests.<ref name=\"EnZim\" />\n\nThe [[Nyanga Mountains]] in the north contain Zimbabwe's highest mountain [[Mount Nyangani]] (2,592 m), and [[Mutarazi Falls]], Africa's second-longest waterfall. Zimbabwe's agricultural [[Honde Valley]] lies southeast of the Nyanga range, and leads into Mozambique.\n\n[[Mutare]] is the largest city in the highlands. It is located on the Zimbabwean side of the Mutare Gap, a saddle between the Nyanga and Bvumba mountains. The main east-west road through the highlands is the [[R5 road (Zimbabwe)|A3]] (Zimbabwe) - N6 (Mozambique), which connects the port of [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] in Mozambique to Zimbabwe's capital [[Harare]] via [[Chimoio]], [[Manica, Mozambique|Manica]], and Mutare, with a border crossing at [[Machipanda]]. The [[Beira\u2013Bulawayo railway]] also crosses the highlands at Machipanda.\n\nThe [[Bvumba Mountains]] are centrally situated south of [[Mutare]]. They lie mostly in Zimbabwe, but a northeastern spur, Monte Vumba, reaches into Mozambique. Agricultural [[Burma Valley]] lies south and east of the Bvumba Mountains. \n\nSouth of Burma Valley, the Tsetsera, Gweni, and Tandara plateaus lie along the border, separated by east-west river valleys lying in fault rifts.<ref>Lister, L.A.

Chimanimani national reserve: management plan. 10.13140/2.1.1734.6240.</ref>\n\nThe [[Chimanimani Mountains]] lie south of the Mussapa Pequeno River, which divides them from the Tandara plateau. The Chimanimani range consists of a high plateau with several ridges running north and south. [[Monte Binga]] on the border is the highest peak in Mozambique and the second-highest in Zimbabwe. Mussapa Gap is a pass through the mountains that follows the eastward-flowing Mussapa Grande River and westward-flowing Nyanyadzi River. Mussapa Gap was an important trade and migration route through the higlands for centuries.<ref>Ghiurghi, Andrea & Dondeyne, S. & Bannerman, J.. (2010). Chimanimani national reserve: management plan. 10.13140/2.1.1734.6240.</ref>\n\nThe Rusitu-Tanganda fault, an east-west rift that carries the eastward-flowing Rusitu River and the westward flowing Tanganda River, marks the southern end of the Chimanimani Mountains. A hilly upland extends south from the fault into Chipinge District, and the highest point is [[Mount Selinda]] at 1230 meters.<Mapure, Isaac (2012). \"Determinants of vegetation composition and diversity of a moist forest-savanna boundary in south-eastern Zimbabwe\". International Journal of Biodiversity and Conservation Vol. 4(14), pp. 584-591, November, 2012</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Highlands are part of the '''East African Highlands''', one of four distinct physiographic divisions on the African continent. The East African Highlands physiographic division consists of the [[East African Rift]] and [[Ethiopian Highlands|Abyssinian]] physiographic provinces, part of the long chain of mountains that runs down [[East Africa]]. The mountains and mountain ranges that make up the East African Highlands share many common plant and animal species and communities, known as [[Afromontane]] flora and fauna.\n\n==Climate==\nThe Highlands have a more equable climate than Zimbabwe's central plateau, with higher rainfall, low cloud and heavy mists and dew as moisture moves inland from the [[Indian Ocean]]. Many streams and rivers originate in these mountains. The northern portion is drained by tributaries of the  [[Zambezi River]], while the southern portion is drained by tributaries of the [[Save River (Africa)|Save River]].<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\">\"Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic\".

The ecoregion includes the portion of the highlands above 1000 meters elevation, including the Inyangani Mountains, Bvumba Mountains, [[Chimanimani Mountains]], Chipinge Uplands, and the isolated [[Mount Gorongosa]] further east in Mozambique. The [[Southern Miombo woodlands]] ecoregion lies at lower elevations east and west of the highlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nThe highlands have a cooler, moister climate than the surrounding lowlands, which support distinct communities of plants and animals. The ecoregion is home to several plant communities: submontane and montane grasslands, moist evergreen forest, dry montane forest, miombo woodlands, and [[heathland]]s.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\n==Flora==\nMuch of the small area consists of rolling hills covered with grassland, which are renewed annually following the fires that occur at the end of the dry season. At lower elevations, ''[[Themeda triandra]]'' is the predominant grass on the more fertile red soils, and ''[[Loudetia simplex]]'' is common on less-fertile white sandy soils. At higher elevations are montane grasslands made up mostly of short, tufted grasses, including ''[[Loudetia simplex]], [[Trachypogon spicatus]], [[Exotheca abyssinica]],'' and ''[[Monocymbium ceresiiforme]]''.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nSome valleys and east-facing slopes contain areas of tropical rainforest, with a high canopy, [[liana]]s, and a rich undergrowth. There are larger areas of dry forest at higher altitudes in places where the ground is well watered and on drier slopes patches of [[miombo]] woodland ''([[Brachystegia spiciformis]]'', ''[[Brachystegia tamarindoides]]'' and ''[[Uapaca kirkiana]]'') and areas of heathland at higher elevations. There are patches of the tall evergreen Mobola Plum ''[[Parinari curatellifolia]]'' near the town of [[Chipinge]] and on the western slopes of the Nyanga Highlands.\n\nIn the Chimanimani Mountains and [[Mount Gorongosa]], heathlands are found on poor, acidic sandy soils derived from [[quartzite]]. The heathlands are of two types, [[Ericaceae|ericaceous]] and [[proteaceous]]. The ericaceous heathlands are dominated by ''Philippia pallidiflora, P. hexandra, Phylica ericoides, Passerina montana, Erica eylesii, E. pleiotricha, E. gazensis,'' and ''E. johnstoniana. Protea gazensis, P. welwitschii'', and ''[[Leucospermum saxosum]]'' are common in the proteaceous heathlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nA number of indigenous monocot lilies with small distribution ranges occur in the highlands. ''Cryptostephanotis vansonii'', ''Cyrtanthus rhodesianus'', and ''Scadoxus pole-evansi'' are popular with rare plant collectors.\n\n==Fauna==\nThis variety of different types of habitat results in a richness of animal life too. Animals found in the highlands include [[blue monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus mitis)'' [[Sykes' monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus albogularis)'', [[East African little collared fruit bat]] ''(Myonycteris relicta)'' and [[Marshall's pygmy chameleon]] ''([[Rhampholeon]] marshalli)''. Many of these animals are found throughout East Africa.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=at1006|name=Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic}}</ref>\n\nThe highlands are also rich in birdlife<ref>Ian Sinclair, Birds of Southern Africa, Struik Publishers 1996</ref> including [[trumpeter hornbill]] ''(Bycanistes bucinator)'', [[Knysna turaco]] ''(Tauraco corythaix)'', [[purple-crested turaco]] ''(Tauraco porphyreolophus)'', [[crested guineafowl]] ''(Guttera pucherani)'' and [[crowned eagle]] ''(Stephanoaetus coronatus)''. Two species, the [[Chirinda apalis]] ''(Apalis chirindensis)'' and [[Roberts's warbler]] ''(Oreophilais robertsi)'', are endemic to the Eastern Highlands. The Chirinda apalis lives deep in the evergreen forests, while Roberts's warbler inhabits the forest edge.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nThe forests are also full of butterflies, most notably [[Papilio|swallowtails]] such as the emperor swallowtail ''([[Papilio ophidicephalus]])'' and the citrus swallowtail ''([[Papilio demodocus]])'' and the forest undergrowth in particular shelters a variety of reptiles including [[skink]]s, [[gecko]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[frog]]s, [[toad]]s, and [[snake]]s.\n{{See also|Reptiles and frogs of the Eastern Highlands}}\n\n==Threats and preservation==\nThe mountain forests are vulnerable to logging and the grasslands susceptible to fire and the rainforests, which by definition grow on well-watered fertile land, to clearance for agriculture. The moist climate is ideal for planting tea, coffee and hardwoods. However, much of the original vegetation remains, especially at higher altitudes, which are not suitable for farming. \n\nLarge areas of the highlands are protected, including [[Nyanga National Park]] in the Nyanga Mountains, [[Bunga Forest Botanical Reserve]] in the Bvumba Mountains, and Zimbabwe's 171km<sup>2</sup> [[Chimanimani National Park]] and Mozambique's [[Chimanimani National Reserve]] in the Chimanimani Mountains.
