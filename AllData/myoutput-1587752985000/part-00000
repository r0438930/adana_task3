These color variations are [[Polymorphism (biology)|morphs]], and are not related to [[molt]]ing. The western North American population, ''B. j. calurus'', is the most variable subspecies and has three main color morphs: light, dark, and intermediate or rufous. The dark and intermediate morphs constitute 10\u201320% of the population in the western United States but seem to constitute only 1\u20132% of ''B. j. calurus'' in western Canada.<ref name=\"Land\" /><ref name= Clark>Clark, W.S.

This feature is variable in eastern hawks and generally absent in some light subspecies (i.e. ''B. j. fuertesi'').<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/> Most adult red-tails have a dark brown nape and upper head which gives them a somewhat hooded appearance, while the throat can variably present a lighter brown \u201cnecklace\u201d. Especially in younger birds, the underside may be otherwise covered with dark brown spotting and some adults may too manifest this stippling. The back is usually a slightly darker brown than elsewhere with paler scapular feathers, ranging from tawny to white, forming a variable imperfect \u201cV\u201d on the back. The tail of most adults, which of course gives this species its name, is rufous brick-red above with a variably sized black subterminal band and generally appears light buff-orange from below. In comparison, the typical pale immatures (i.e. less than two years old) typically have a mildly paler headed and tend to show a darker back than adults with more apparent pale wing feather edges above (for descriptions of dark morph juveniles from ''B. j. calurus'', which is also generally apt for description of rare dark morphs of other races, see under that subspecies description). In immature red-tailed hawks of all hues, the tail is a light brown above with numerous small dark brown bars of roughly equal width, but these tend to be much broader on dark morph birds.

They are the heaviest ''Buteos'' on average in eastern North America, albeit scarcely ahead of the larger winged [[rough-legged buzzard]] (''Buteo lagopus''), and second only in size in the west to the [[ferruginous hawk]] (''Buteo regalis''). Red-tailed hawks may be anywhere from the fifth to the ninth heaviest ''Buteo'' in the world depending on what figures are used. However, in the northwestern United States, ferruginous hawk females are 35% heavier than female red-tails from the same area.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees /> On average, western red-tailed hawks are relatively longer winged and lankier proportioned but are slightly less stocky, compact and heavy than eastern red-tailed hawks in North America. Eastern hawks may also have mildly larger talons and bills than western ones. Based on comparisons of morphology and function amongst all accipitrids, these features imply that western red-tails may need to vary their hunting more frequently to on the wing as the habitat diversifies to more open situations and presumably would hunt more variable and faster prey, whereas the birds of the east, which was historically well-wooded, are more dedicated perch hunters and can take somewhat larger prey but are likely more dedicated mammal hunters.<ref name= Preston/><ref name= Pearlstine>{{cite journal|author=Pearlstine, E.

The red-tailed hawk is the only North American hawk with a rufous tail and a blackish [[patagium]] marking on the leading edge of its wing (which is obscured only on dark morph adults and Harlan\u2019s hawks by similarly dark colored feathers).<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/> Other larger adult ''[[Buteo]]'' in North America usually have obvious distinct markings that are absent in red-tails, whether the rufous-brown \u201cbeard\u201d of [[Swainson's hawk]]s (''Buteo swainsonii'') or the colorful rufous belly and shoulder markings and striking black-and-white mantle of [[red-shouldered hawk]]s (also the small \u201cwindows\u201d seen at the end of their primaries).<ref name= Robbins>Robbins, C. S., Bruun, B., & Zim, H. S. (2001). ''Birds of North America: a guide to field identification''. Macmillan.</ref> In perched individuals, even as silhouettes, the shape of large ''Buteos'' may be distinctive, such as the wingtips overhanging the tail in several other species, but not in red-tails. North American ''Buteos'' range from the dainty, compact builds of much smaller ''Buteos'', such as [[broad-winged hawk]] (''Buteo platypterus'') to the heavyset, neckless look of [[ferruginous hawk]]s or the [[rough-legged buzzard]] which has a compact, smaller appearance than a red-tail in perched birds due to its small bill, short neck and much shorter tarsus, while the opposite effect occurs in flying rough-legs with their much bigger wing area.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Robbins/> In flight, most other large North American ''[[Buteo]]'' are distinctly longer and slenderer winged than red-tailed hawks, with the much paler [[ferruginous hawk]] having peculiarly slender wings in relation to its massive, chunky body. Swainson's hawks are distinctly darker on the wing and ferruginous hawks are much paler winged than typical red-tailed hawks. Pale morph adult ferruginous hawk can show mildly tawny-pink (but never truly rufous) upper tail, and like red-tails tend to have dark markings on underwing-coverts and can have a dark belly band but compared to red-tailed hawks have a distinctly broader head, their [[Flight feathers|remiges]] are much whiter looking with very small dark primary tips, they lack the red-tail\u2019s diagnostic patagial marks and usually (but not always) also lack the dark subterminal tail-band, and ferruginous have a totally feathered tarsus. With its whitish head, the ferruginous hawk is most similar to Krider's red-tailed hawks, especially in immature plumage, but the larger hawk has broader head and narrower wing shape and the ferruginous immatures are paler underneath and on their legs. Several species share a belly band with the typical red-tailed hawk but they vary from subtle (as in the ferruginous hawk) to solid blackish, the latter in most light-morph [[rough-legged buzzard]]s.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Brown/> More difficult to identify among adult red-tails are its darkest variations, as most species of ''[[Buteo]]'' in North America also have dark morphs. Western dark morph red-tails (i.e. ''calurus'') adults, however, retain the typical distinctive brick-red tail which other species lack, which may stand out even more against the otherwise all chocolate brown-black bird. Standard pale juveniles when perched show a whitish patch in the outer half of the upper surface of the wing which other juvenile ''Buteo'' lack.<ref name= CRPreston/> The most difficult to identify stages and plumage types are dark morph juveniles, Harlan\u2019s hawk and some Krider\u2019s hawks (the latter mainly with typical ferruginous hawks as aforementioned). Some darker juveniles are similar enough to other ''Buteo'' juveniles that it has been stated that they \"cannot be identified to species with any confidence under various field conditions.\"<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= CRPreston/> However, field identification techniques have advanced in the last few decades and most experienced hawk-watchers can distinguish even the most vexingly plumaged immature hawks, especially as the wing shapes of each species becomes apparent after seeing many.

Adult wintering red-tails tend to perch more prominently than immatures do, which select lower or more secluded perches. Immatures are often missed in winter bird counts, unless they are being displaced by dominant adults. Generally though, immatures can seem to recognize that they are less likely to be attacked by adults during winter and can perch surprisingly close to them. Age is the most significant consideration of wintering hawks\u2019 hierarchy but size does factor in, as larger immatures (presumably usually females) are less likely to displaced than smaller ones.<ref name= CRPreston/><ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Preston/> Dark adult red-tailed hawks appear to be harder to locate when perched than other red-tails.

Red-tails often select the highest available perches within a given environment since the greater the height they are at, the less flapping is required and the faster the downward glide they can attain toward nearby prey. If prey is closer than average, the hawk may glide at a steep downward angle with few flaps, if farther than average, it may flap a few swift wingbeats alternating with glides.

Furthermore, due to its ability to nest in varied habitats, home ranges also frequently abut those of other raptor species.<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Preston/> The most obvious similar species in their range are other ''[[Buteo]]'' hawks, especially larger species with a similar ecological niche.

It also breeds notably later than the other two species.<ref>England, A. S., Bechard, M. J., & Houston, C. S. (1997). ''Swainson's hawk''. American Ornithologists' Union.</ref> Surprisingly, although it's slightly smaller in body mass and has notably smaller (and presumably weaker) feet than ferruginous and red-tailed hawks, the Swainson's is actually usually (but not invariably) dominant in territorial conflicts over the other two. Part of this advantage is that the Swainson's hawk is apparently a superior flier both in long and short distance flights, with its more pointed wing shape and lower wing loading allowing it more agile, sustained and speedier flight that the bulkier hawks cannot match.<ref name= Swainson>Janes, S.

Red-tails may be somewhat dominant based on prior reports in food conflicts but the ferruginous hawk may also win these.<ref name= CRPreston/> Where they overlap, the hawk species may adjust their daily routine to minimize contact, which tends to be costly of time and energy and may cause the hawks to abandon their nests for long stretches of time, which in turn leaves their young vulnerable to predation.<ref name= Palmer/> When habitats change rapidly, often due to human interference, and the species nest more closely than natural partitioning would allow, in all three nesting success can decline significantly.<ref name= Schmutz/>\n\nBeyond the Swainson's and ferruginous hawks, six other ''Buteos'' co-occur with red-tailed hawks in different parts of North America. Many of these are substantially smaller than red-tails and most serious territorial conflicts with them are naturally mitigated by nesting in deeper wooded areas.<ref name= Bent/><ref name= Johnsgard/> One other larger species, the [[rough-legged buzzard]], mostly nests far north of the breeding range of red-tailed hawks. However, in [[Alaska]] they sometimes nest in the same areas. The rough-legged buzzards are both cliff and tree nesters and areas used by the two species are not necessarily mutually exclusive but each seems to avoid the other, in part by differing breeding schedules.<ref>Mindell, D.P. (1983). ''Nesting raptors in southwestern Alaska: Status, distribution, and aspects of biology''. Alaska Technical Report 8. Anchorage: Bureau of Land Management.</ref> Wintering rough-legged buzzards may regularly come into conflict over food with red-tailed hawks and seem to be subordinate to the red-tails, with several records of them being chased off both kills and carrion by the red-tailed hawks. During winter their hunting habits may keep them somewhat separate, the rough-legged being a much more aerial hunter, but rough-legged buzzards usually withdrew if a red-tailed hawk flew towards them. There is at least one case, however, of a rough-legged buzzard being the victor of a conflict over a kill with a red-tailed hawk.<ref name= Lowe/><ref name= Bildstein/> Red-tailed hawks are conspicuously more aggressive and tend to be dominant over slenderer, medium-sized ''Buteos'' such as [[red-shouldered hawk]]s and [[zone-tailed hawk]]s (''Buteo albonotatus'').<ref name= Brown/> In [[Massachusetts]], red-shoulder hawks used mixed forests and hardwoods as nesting habitat while red-tails most often used in pitch pine and stunted oaks on [[Cape Cod]]. Nesting range overlap here most often occurred on [[white pine]] forests. As habitat has opened over time, red-tailed hawks frequently took over former red-shouldered hawk territories, even using their nests in two cases.<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Bent/> In north-central Florida, it was found during winter that red-shouldered and red-tailed hawk habitat usage blurred and, because the local habitat favors red-shouldered hawks, they easily outnumbered the number of red-tailed hawks in the area.

Great horned owls are incapable of constructing nests and readily expropriate existing red-tail nests. The habitat preferences of the two species are quite similar and the owl frequently uses old red-tail nests, but they do seem to prefer more enclosed nest locations where available over the generally open situation around red-tailed hawk nests. Sometimes in warmer areas, the owls may nest sufficiently early to have fledged young by the time red-tails start to lay. However, when there is a temporal overlap in reproductive cycles, the owl sometimes takes over an occupied red-tail nest, causing desertion. Red-tailed hawks have an advantage in staple prey flexibility as aforementioned, while great horned owl populations can be stressed when preferred prey is scarce, especially when they rely on leporids such as [[Snowshoe hare|hares]] and [[Black-tailed jackrabbit|jackrabbits]].<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Marti95/><ref name= Doyle/><ref name= Smith/> For example, in [[Alberta]], when [[snowshoe hare]]s were at their population peak, red-tailed hawks did not increase in population despite taking many, with only a slight increase in mean clutch size, whereas the owls fluctuated in much more dramatic ways in accordance with snowshoe hare numbers. The red-tails migratory behavior was considered as the likely cause of this lack of effect, whereas great horned owls remained through the winter and was subject to winter-stress and greater risk of starvation.<ref name= McInvaille>McInvaille, W. B. (1972). ''Predator-prey relations and breeding biology of the great horned owl and red-tailed hawk in central Alberta''.

On the other hand, red-tailed hawks are rarely (if ever) a threat to the great horned owl. Occasionally a red-tailed hawk can strike down an owl during the day but only in a few singular cases has this killed an owl.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wilson, P.W. & Grigsby, E.M. |year=1980|title=Red-tailed Hawks Attack Great Horned Owl|journal=Inland Bird Banding|volume= 54|pages=80}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Smith, D.

It is presumable that sparser habitat and prey resources increased the closeness of nesting habits of the two species, to the detriment of the red-tails.

A perched display, with fluffed-out breast feathers may too occur at this time. Even males that are in spring migration have been recorded engaging in a separate display: circling at slow speed before partially closing wings, dropping legs with talons spread and tilting from side-to-side. A female hawk is usually around when migrating male does this but she does not engage in this display herself.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Palmer/> The area of occupancy of breeding territories by pairs is variable based on regional habitat composition.

The female feeds the eyasses after tearing the food into small pieces. The young red-tails are active by the second day when they issue soft peeping calls, bounce, and wave continuously with their wings. By day 7, the bouncing and peeping begin to wane, and young start to peck at prey in their nest. Nestlings emit high whistling notes (usually in response to adults overhead) by day 10, sit up on tarsometatarsi by day 15, become aggressive toward intruders by day 16, strike out with talons and wings by day 21, begin to stretch wings and exercise regularly by day 30.

In the east, red-tailed hawk females rarely defend nests from humans but historically in California and quite often still in [[Alaska]], some female will dive repeatedly and \"savagely\", sometimes snapping off large branches in her temper, occasionally stunning herself or inadvertently knocking down her own youngster if it is attempting to fledge. Apparently, the less extensive prior exposure they have to humans may make mature females more aggressive towards humans near the nest.<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Brown/><ref name= Lowe/> Although development is asynchronical in most nests, [[runt]]ing may sometimes be recorded and even [[siblicide]] may occur, with the parents feeding the weaker, younger chicks less so and both the siblings and parents occasionally aggressively pecking the \u201crunts\u201d of the nest. Ultimately, the runt in such cases does not usually survive and may be either found crushed in the nest, discarded out of the nest after starvation or consumed by the parents or the siblings. However, as a whole, such killings are fairly rare and only occur when food supplies are extremely low, often this being in sync with poor spring weather (such as overly rainy or cold conditions).<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Hagar/><ref name= Stinson/> If there is too much food, such as [[California ground squirrel]]s in California, the parents will discard remains after a day or two since decomposition of their prey invites infection, other diseases and blood-sucking insects to the nest that may endanger the nestlings. However, after about four weeks, the female often stops discarding leftover prey and the increased presence of flies may form somewhat of a risk to disease in the young but may also merely get the young to leave the nest sooner.<ref name= Brown/><ref name= Fitch/> One nest in California had two females and one male attended to; the male performed his usual function but both females would brood and tend to the nest.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wiley, J.

During this period, the fledglings remain fairly sedentary, though they may chase parents and beg for food. Parents deliver food directly or, more commonly, drop it near the young. Short flights are typically undertaken for the first 3 weeks after fledgling and the young red-tails activity level often doubles. About 6 to 7 weeks after fledging, the young begin to capture their own prey, which often consists of insects and frogs that the young hawks can drop down to onto the ground with relative ease. At the point they are 15 weeks old, they may start attempts to hunt more difficult mammal and bird prey in sync with their newly developed skills for sustained flight, and most are efficient mammal predators fairly soon after their first attempts at such prey. Shortly thereafter, when the young are around 4 months of age, they become independent of their parents.

However, some individuals may learn to ambush game birds on the ground before they are able to take off and accelerate to full speed, or as they have fly into cover after a chase. Some have even learned to use a falcon-like diving stoop to capture challenging game birds such as pheasants in open country.\n\nIn the course of a typical hunt, a falconer using a red-tailed hawk most commonly releases the hawk and allows it to perch in a tree or other high vantage point. The falconer, who may be aided by a dog, then attempts to [[Hunting#Methods|flush]] prey by stirring up ground cover. A well-trained red-tailed hawk will follow the falconer and dog, realizing that their activities produce opportunities to catch game. Once a raptor catches game, it does not bring it back to the falconer.

Especially in younger birds, the underside may be otherwise covered with dark brown spotting and some adults may too manifest this stippling. The back is usually a slightly darker brown than elsewhere with paler scapular feathers, ranging from tawny to white, forming a variable imperfect \u201cV\u201d on the back. The tail of most adults, which of course gives this species its name, is rufous brick-red above with a variably sized black subterminal band and generally appears light buff-orange from below. In comparison, the typical pale immatures (i.e. less than two years old) typically have a mildly paler headed and tend to show a darker back than adults with more apparent pale wing feather edges above (for descriptions of dark morph juveniles from ''B. j. calurus'', which is also generally apt for description of rare dark morphs of other races, see under that subspecies description). In immature red-tailed hawks of all hues, the tail is a light brown above with numerous small dark brown bars of roughly equal width, but these tend to be much broader on dark morph birds.

They are the heaviest ''Buteos'' on average in eastern North America, albeit scarcely ahead of the larger winged [[rough-legged buzzard]] (''Buteo lagopus''), and second only in size in the west to the [[ferruginous hawk]] (''Buteo regalis'').

Eastern hawks may also have mildly larger talons and bills than western ones. Based on comparisons of morphology and function amongst all accipitrids, these features imply that western red-tails may need to vary their hunting more frequently to on the wing as the habitat diversifies to more open situations and presumably would hunt more variable and faster prey, whereas the birds of the east, which was historically well-wooded, are more dedicated perch hunters and can take somewhat larger prey but are likely more dedicated mammal hunters.<ref name= Preston/><ref name= Pearlstine>{{cite journal|author=Pearlstine, E.

The red-tailed hawk is the only North American hawk with a rufous tail and a blackish [[patagium]] marking on the leading edge of its wing (which is obscured only on dark morph adults and Harlan\u2019s hawks by similarly dark colored feathers).<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/> Other larger adult ''[[Buteo]]'' in North America usually have obvious distinct markings that are absent in red-tails, whether the rufous-brown \u201cbeard\u201d of [[Swainson's hawk]]s (''Buteo swainsonii'') or the colorful rufous belly and shoulder markings and striking black-and-white mantle of [[red-shouldered hawk]]s (also the small \u201cwindows\u201d seen at the end of their primaries).<ref name= Robbins>Robbins, C. S., Bruun, B., & Zim, H. S. (2001). ''Birds of North America: a guide to field identification''. Macmillan.</ref> In perched individuals, even as silhouettes, the shape of large ''Buteos'' may be distinctive, such as the wingtips overhanging the tail in several other species, but not in red-tails. North American ''Buteos'' range from the dainty, compact builds of much smaller ''Buteos'', such as [[broad-winged hawk]] (''Buteo platypterus'') to the heavyset, neckless look of [[ferruginous hawk]]s or the [[rough-legged buzzard]] which has a compact, smaller appearance than a red-tail in perched birds due to its small bill, short neck and much shorter tarsus, while the opposite effect occurs in flying rough-legs with their much bigger wing area.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Robbins/> In flight, most other large North American ''[[Buteo]]'' are distinctly longer and slenderer winged than red-tailed hawks, with the much paler [[ferruginous hawk]] having peculiarly slender wings in relation to its massive, chunky body. Swainson's hawks are distinctly darker on the wing and ferruginous hawks are much paler winged than typical red-tailed hawks. Pale morph adult ferruginous hawk can show mildly tawny-pink (but never truly rufous) upper tail, and like red-tails tend to have dark markings on underwing-coverts and can have a dark belly band but compared to red-tailed hawks have a distinctly broader head, their [[Flight feathers|remiges]] are much whiter looking with very small dark primary tips, they lack the red-tail\u2019s diagnostic patagial marks and usually (but not always) also lack the dark subterminal tail-band, and ferruginous have a totally feathered tarsus. With its whitish head, the ferruginous hawk is most similar to Krider's red-tailed hawks, especially in immature plumage, but the larger hawk has broader head and narrower wing shape and the ferruginous immatures are paler underneath and on their legs. Several species share a belly band with the typical red-tailed hawk but they vary from subtle (as in the ferruginous hawk) to solid blackish, the latter in most light-morph [[rough-legged buzzard]]s.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Brown/> More difficult to identify among adult red-tails are its darkest variations, as most species of ''[[Buteo]]'' in North America also have dark morphs. Western dark morph red-tails (i.e. ''calurus'') adults, however, retain the typical distinctive brick-red tail which other species lack, which may stand out even more against the otherwise all chocolate brown-black bird. Standard pale juveniles when perched show a whitish patch in the outer half of the upper surface of the wing which other juvenile ''Buteo'' lack.<ref name= CRPreston/> The most difficult to identify stages and plumage types are dark morph juveniles, Harlan\u2019s hawk and some Krider\u2019s hawks (the latter mainly with typical ferruginous hawks as aforementioned). Some darker juveniles are similar enough to other ''Buteo'' juveniles that it has been stated that they \"cannot be identified to species with any confidence under various field conditions.\"<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= CRPreston/> However, field identification techniques have advanced in the last few decades and most experienced hawk-watchers can distinguish even the most vexingly plumaged immature hawks, especially as the wing shapes of each species becomes apparent after seeing many. Harlan\u2019s hawks are most similar to dark morph [[rough-legged buzzard]]s and dark morph [[ferruginous hawk]]s. Wing shape is the most reliable identification tool for distinguishing the Harlan\u2019s from these, but also the pale streaking on the breast of Harlan\u2019s, which tends to be conspicuous in most individuals, and is lacking in the other hawks. Also dark morph ferruginous hawks do not have the dark subterminal band of a Harlan\u2019s hawk but do bear a black undertail covert lacking in Harlan\u2019s.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name=\"Harlan\">{{cite journal|author=Liguori, J. & Sullivan, B.L.|year=2010|title=Comparison of Harlan's hawk with Eastern & Western Red-tailed Hawks|journal=Birding|pages=30\u201337}}</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n[[File:Red-tailed hawk in flight.jpg|thumb|right|In flight showing the red tail]]\n[[File:Hawk hovers.ogv|thumb|Red-tailed hawk hovers in the wind]]\nThe red-tailed hawk is a member of the subfamily [[Buteoninae]] which includes about 55 currently recognized species.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= delHoyo/> Unlike many lineages of accipitrid, which seemed to have radiated out of Africa or south Asia, the Buteoninae clearly originated in the Americas based on fossil records and current species distributions (more than 75% of the extant hawks from this lineage are found in the Americas).<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref>Brodkorb, P.

Most birds in resident populations, which are well more than half of all red-tailed hawks, usually split non-breeding season activity between territorial soaring flight and sitting on a perch. Often perching is for hunting purposes, but many will sit on a tree branch for hours, occasionally stretching on a single wing or leg to keep limber, with no signs of hunting intent.<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= CRPreston/><ref name= Bent/> Wintering typical pale-morph hawks in [[Arkansas]] were found to perch in open areas near the top of tall, isolated trees, whereas dark morphs more frequently perched in dense groups of trees.<ref name= CRPreston/> For many, and perhaps most, red-tailed hawks being mobbed by various birds is a daily concern and can effectively disrupt many of their daily behaviors. Mostly larger [[passerine]]s, of multiple families from [[tyrant flycatcher]]s to [[icterid]]s, will mob red-tails, despite that other raptors such as ''[[Accipiter]]'' hawks and [[falcon]]s are a notably greater danger to them.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Knight, R.

Adult wintering red-tails tend to perch more prominently than immatures do, which select lower or more secluded perches. Immatures are often missed in winter bird counts, unless they are being displaced by dominant adults. Generally though, immatures can seem to recognize that they are less likely to be attacked by adults during winter and can perch surprisingly close to them. Age is the most significant consideration of wintering hawks\u2019 hierarchy but size does factor in, as larger immatures (presumably usually females) are less likely to displaced than smaller ones.<ref name= CRPreston/><ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Preston/> Dark adult red-tailed hawks appear to be harder to locate when perched than other red-tails.

Springer US.</ref> Red-tailed hawks usually hunt by watching for prey activity from a high perch, also known as still hunting. Upon being spotted, prey is dropped down upon by the hawk. Red-tails often select the highest available perches within a given environment since the greater the height they are at, the less flapping is required and the faster the downward glide they can attain toward nearby prey. If prey is closer than average, the hawk may glide at a steep downward angle with few flaps, if farther than average, it may flap a few swift wingbeats alternating with glides. Perch hunting is the most successful hunting method generally speaking for red-tailed hawks and can account for up to 83% of their daily activities (i.e. in winter).<ref name= Preston/><ref name= Palmer/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Orde, C.

During winter their hunting habits may keep them somewhat separate, the rough-legged being a much more aerial hunter, but rough-legged buzzards usually withdrew if a red-tailed hawk flew towards them. There is at least one case, however, of a rough-legged buzzard being the victor of a conflict over a kill with a red-tailed hawk.<ref name= Lowe/><ref name= Bildstein/> Red-tailed hawks are conspicuously more aggressive and tend to be dominant over slenderer, medium-sized ''Buteos'' such as [[red-shouldered hawk]]s and [[zone-tailed hawk]]s (''Buteo albonotatus'').<ref name= Brown/> In [[Massachusetts]], red-shoulder hawks used mixed forests and hardwoods as nesting habitat while red-tails most often used in pitch pine and stunted oaks on [[Cape Cod]].

Great horned owls are incapable of constructing nests and readily expropriate existing red-tail nests. The habitat preferences of the two species are quite similar and the owl frequently uses old red-tail nests, but they do seem to prefer more enclosed nest locations where available over the generally open situation around red-tailed hawk nests. Sometimes in warmer areas, the owls may nest sufficiently early to have fledged young by the time red-tails start to lay. However, when there is a temporal overlap in reproductive cycles, the owl sometimes takes over an occupied red-tail nest, causing desertion. Red-tailed hawks have an advantage in staple prey flexibility as aforementioned, while great horned owl populations can be stressed when preferred prey is scarce, especially when they rely on leporids such as [[Snowshoe hare|hares]] and [[Black-tailed jackrabbit|jackrabbits]].<ref name= Palmer/><ref name= Marti95/><ref name= Doyle/><ref name= Smith/> For example, in [[Alberta]], when [[snowshoe hare]]s were at their population peak, red-tailed hawks did not increase in population despite taking many, with only a slight increase in mean clutch size, whereas the owls fluctuated in much more dramatic ways in accordance with snowshoe hare numbers. The red-tails migratory behavior was considered as the likely cause of this lack of effect, whereas great horned owls remained through the winter and was subject to winter-stress and greater risk of starvation.<ref name= McInvaille>McInvaille, W. B. (1972). ''Predator-prey relations and breeding biology of the great horned owl and red-tailed hawk in central Alberta''.

On the other hand, red-tailed hawks are rarely (if ever) a threat to the great horned owl. Occasionally a red-tailed hawk can strike down an owl during the day but only in a few singular cases has this killed an owl.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wilson, P.W. & Grigsby, E.M. |year=1980|title=Red-tailed Hawks Attack Great Horned Owl|journal=Inland Bird Banding|volume= 54|pages=80}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Smith, D.

A perched display, with fluffed-out breast feathers may too occur at this time.

Ultimately, the runt in such cases does not usually survive and may be either found crushed in the nest, discarded out of the nest after starvation or consumed by the parents or the siblings.

About 6 to 7 weeks after fledging, the young begin to capture their own prey, which often consists of insects and frogs that the young hawks can drop down to onto the ground with relative ease. At the point they are 15 weeks old, they may start attempts to hunt more difficult mammal and bird prey in sync with their newly developed skills for sustained flight, and most are efficient mammal predators fairly soon after their first attempts at such prey. Shortly thereafter, when the young are around 4 months of age, they become independent of their parents. In some extreme cases, juvenile red-tails may prolong their association with their parents to as long as they are half a year old, as was recorded in [[Wisconsin]].<ref name= Petersen/><ref name= CRPreston/><ref name= Johnson>{{cite journal|author=Johnson, S.

However, some individuals may learn to ambush game birds on the ground before they are able to take off and accelerate to full speed, or as they have fly into cover after a chase. Some have even learned to use a falcon-like diving stoop to capture challenging game birds such as pheasants in open country.\n\nIn the course of a typical hunt, a falconer using a red-tailed hawk most commonly releases the hawk and allows it to perch in a tree or other high vantage point. The falconer, who may be aided by a dog, then attempts to [[Hunting#Methods|flush]] prey by stirring up ground cover. A well-trained red-tailed hawk will follow the falconer and dog, realizing that their activities produce opportunities to catch game. Once a raptor catches game, it does not bring it back to the falconer. Instead, the falconer must locate the bird and its captured prey, \"make in\" (carefully approach) and trade the bird off its kill in exchange for a piece of offered meat.<ref name= Beebe/><ref name=\"McGranaghan\">{{cite book| last =McGranaghan| first =Liam J.| title =The Red-Tailed Hawk: A Complete Guide to Training and Hunting North America's Most Versatile Game Hawk.| publisher =Western Sporting Publications| year =2001| page =181| isbn =978-0-9709571-0-8}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"140px\">\nFile:Lena Chang (41351815842).jpg|A trained red-tailed hawk working with a volunteer from the Ojai Raptor Center\nFile:Red-tailed hawk, falconer's bird.jpg|A falconer's red-tailed hawk comes in for a landing\n</gallery>\n\n=== Feathers and Native American use ===\nThe [[feather]]s and other parts of the red-tailed hawk are considered [[sacred]] to many American [[indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] and, like the feathers of the [[bald eagle]] and [[golden eagle]], are sometimes used in religious ceremonies and found adorning the [[regalia]] of many [[Native Americans in the United States]]; these parts, most especially their distinctive tail feathers, are a popular item in the Native American community.<ref name=\"Pequot\">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.pequotmuseum.org/Home/CrossPaths/CrossPathsSpring2003/TheSacredMessengers.htm|last=Collier|first= Julie|title=The Sacred Messengers|journal=Cross Paths|date=Spring 2003|volume=6|issue=1|accessdate=20 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124145720/http://www.pequotmuseum.org/Home/CrossPaths/CrossPathsSpring2003/TheSacredMessengers.htm |archivedate=24 January 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> As with the other two species, the feathers and parts of the red-tailed hawk are regulated by the [[eagle feather law]],<ref name=\"Title 50\">{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title50/50cfr22_main_02.tpl|title=TITLE 50\u2014Wildlife and Fisheries|publisher=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR)|accessdate=20 June 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610034613/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&tpl=%2Fecfrbrowse%2FTitle50%2F50cfr22_main_02.tpl|archivedate=10 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> which governs the possession of feathers and parts of migratory birds.<ref name=\"Feathers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pequotmuseum.org/Home/CrossPaths/CrossPathsSpring2003/FeatherLaw.htm|last=Cook|first=Stephen|title=Feather Law|publisher=Mashantucket Pequot Museum|accessdate=20 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Citations ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Cited sources==\n*{{cite book|title=The Birds of North America |editor=Poole, A.
