Ideas of India (section IX)}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, the issue of national language was a bitterly contested subject in the proceedings of the [[Constituent Assembly of India]], specifically what should be the language in which the Constitution of India is written and the language spoken during the proceedings of Parliament and thus deserving of the epithet \"national\". Members belonging to the northern parts of India insisted that the Constitution be drafted in Hindi with the unofficial translation in English. This was not agreed to by the drafting Committee on the grounds that English was much better to craft the nuanced prose on constitutional subjects. The efforts to make Hindi the pre-eminent language were bitterly resisted by the members from those parts of India where Hindi was not spoken natively.\n\nEventually, a compromise was reached not to include any mention to a national language. Instead, [[Hindi]] in [[Devanagari]] script was declared to be the [[official language]] of the union, but for \"fifteen years from the commencement of the Constitution, the English Language shall continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union for which it was being used immediately before such commencement\".<ref name=\"Guha2011\"/>\n\nArticle 343 (1) of the [[Constitution of India]] states \"The Official Language of the Union government shall be Hindi in Devanagari script.\"<ref name=cons/>{{rp|212}}<ref name=\"Benedikter2009\">{{cite book|author=Thomas Benedikter|title=Language Policy and Linguistic Minorities in India: An Appraisal of the Linguistic Rights of Minorities in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpZv2GHM7VQC&pg=PA32|accessdate=19 December 2014|year=2009|publisher=LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster|isbn=978-3-643-10231-7|pages=32\u201335}}</ref> Unless Parliament decided otherwise, the use of [[English language|English]] for official purposes was to cease 15 years after the constitution came into effect, i.e. on 26 January 1965.<ref name=cons/>{{rp|212}}<ref name=\"Benedikter2009\"/>\n\n{{Main|Hindi language}}\n{{main|Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu}}\n\nAs the date for changeover approached, however, there was much alarm in the non Hindi-speaking areas of India, especially in [[Kerala]], [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[West Bengal]], [[Karnataka]], [[Puducherry]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]].
