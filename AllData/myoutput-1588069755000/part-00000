Georgiev]]]]\n\nThe Greek language is conventionally divided into the following periods:\n* '''[[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]]''': the unrecorded but assumed last ancestor of all known varieties of Greek. The unity of Proto-Greek would have ended as Hellenic migrants entered the [[Geography of Greece|Greek peninsula]] sometime in the [[Neolithic]] era or the [[Bronze Age]].{{NoteTag|A comprehensive overview in J.T. Hooker's ''Mycenaean Greece'' ({{harvnb|Hooker|1976|loc=Chapter 2: \"Before the Mycenaean Age\", pp. 11\u201333 and passim}}); for a different hypothesis excluding massive migrations and favoring an autochthonous scenario, see Colin Renfrew's \"Problems in the General Correlation of Archaeological and Linguistic Strata in Prehistoric Greece: The Model of Autochthonous Origin\" ({{harvnb|Renfrew|1973|pp=263\u2013276, especially p. 267}}) in ''Bronze Age Migrations'' by R.A. Crossland and A. Birchall, eds. (1973).}}\n* '''[[Mycenaean Greek]]''': the language of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]]. It is recorded in the [[Linear B]] script on tablets dating from the 15th century BC onwards.\n* '''[[Ancient Greek]]''': in its various [[Ancient Greek dialects|dialects]], the language of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek civilization]]. It was widely known throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. Ancient Greek fell into disuse in western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], but remained officially in use in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] world and was reintroduced to the rest of Europe with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and [[Greeks|Greek]] migration to western Europe.\n* '''[[Koine Greek]]''': The fusion of [[Ionian Greek|Ionian]] with [[Attic Greek|Attic]], the dialect of [[Classical Athens|Athens]], began the process that resulted in the creation of the first common Greek dialect, which became a [[lingua franca]] across the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] and [[Near East]]. Koine Greek can be initially traced within the armies and conquered territories of [[Alexander the Great]] and after the Hellenistic colonization of the known world, it was spoken from [[Egypt]] to the fringes of [[India]]. After the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] conquest of Greece, an unofficial [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] of Greek and [[Latin]] was established in the city of [[Rome]] and Koine Greek became a first or second language in the [[Roman Empire]]. The origin of [[Christianity]] can also be traced through Koine Greek, because the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] used this form of the language to spread Christianity. It is also known as '''Hellenistic Greek''', '''New Testament Greek''', and sometimes '''Biblical Greek''' because it was the original language of the [[New Testament]] and the [[Old Testament]] was translated into the same language via the [[Septuagint]].\n[[File:Anatolian Greek dialects.png|thumb|Distribution of varieties of Greek in [[Anatolia]], 1910.

''Medieval Greek'' is a cover phrase for a whole continuum of different speech and writing styles, ranging from vernacular continuations of spoken Koine that were already approaching [[Modern Greek]] in many respects, to highly learned forms imitating classical Attic. Much of the written Greek that was used as the official language of the Byzantine Empire was an eclectic middle-ground variety based on the tradition of written Koine.\n* '''[[Modern Greek]]''' (Neo-Hellenic):<ref name=\"Ethnologue\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ell|title=Greek|website=Ethnologue|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Stemming from Medieval Greek, Modern Greek usages can be traced in the Byzantine period, as early as the 11th century. It is the language used by the modern Greeks, and, apart from Standard Modern Greek, there are several [[Varieties of Modern Greek|dialects]] of it.\n\n===Diglossia===\n{{Main|Greek language question}}\n\nIn the modern era, the Greek language entered a state of [[diglossia]]: the coexistence of vernacular and archaizing written forms of the language. What came to be known as the [[Greek language question]] was a polarization between two competing varieties of [[Modern Greek]]: [[Demotic Greek|Dimotiki]], the vernacular form of Modern Greek proper, and [[Katharevousa]], meaning 'purified', a compromise between Dimotiki and [[Ancient Greek]], which was developed in the early 19th century and was used for literary and official purposes in the newly formed Greek state. In 1976, Dimotiki was declared the official language of Greece, having incorporated features of Katharevousa and giving birth to [[Varieties of Modern Greek#Standard Modern Greek|Standard Modern Greek]], which is used today for all official purposes and in [[education in Greece|education]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The modern Greek language : a descriptive analysis of standard modern Greek|last=Peter|first=Mackridge|date=1985|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-815770-0|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire]|oclc=11134463}}</ref>\n\n===Historical unity===\n[[File:Modern Greek dialects en.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The distribution of major modern Greek dialect areas]]\n\nThe historical unity and continuing identity between the various stages of the Greek language is often emphasized. Although Greek has undergone morphological and phonological changes comparable to those seen in other languages, never since classical antiquity has its cultural, literary, and orthographic tradition been interrupted to the extent that one can speak of a new language emerging. Greek speakers today still tend to regard literary works of ancient Greek as part of their own rather than a foreign language.<ref>{{harvnb|Browning|1983}}.</ref> It is also often stated that the historical changes have been relatively slight compared with some other languages.

The division into conventional periods is, as with all such periodizations, relatively arbitrary, especially because at all periods, Ancient Greek has enjoyed high prestige, and the literate borrowed heavily from it.\n\n===Phonology===\n{{See also|Modern Greek phonology}}\n\n[[File:Seferisrede.ogg|thumb|Spoken [[Modern Greek]]]]\n\nAcross its history, the syllabic structure of Greek has varied little: Greek shows a mixed syllable structure, permitting complex syllabic onsets but very restricted codas. It has only oral vowels and a fairly stable set of consonantal contrasts. The main phonological changes occurred during the Hellenistic and Roman period (see [[Koine Greek phonology]] for details):\n* replacement of the [[pitch accent]] with a [[stress (linguistics)|stress accent]].\n* simplification of the system of [[vowel]]s and [[diphthong]]s: loss of vowel length distinction, monophthongisation of most diphthongs and several steps in a [[chain shift]] of vowels towards {{IPA|/i/}} ([[iotacism]]).\n* development of the [[voicelessness|voiceless]] [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] [[stop consonant|plosives]] {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}} and {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}} to the voiceless [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, respectively; the similar development of {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}} to {{IPA|/x/}} may have taken place later (the phonological changes are not reflected in the orthography, and both earlier and later phonemes are written with [[Phi (letter)|\u03c6]], [[Theta|\u03b8]], and [[Chi (letter)|\u03c7]]).\n* development of the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] plosives {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} to their voiced fricative counterparts {{IPA|/\u03b2/}} (later {{IPA|/v/}}), {{IPA|/\u00f0/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0263/}}.\n\n=== Morphology ===\nIn all its stages, the morphology of Greek shows an extensive set of productive derivational affixes, a limited but productive system of compounding<ref>{{harvnb|Ralli|2001|pp=164\u2013203}}.</ref> and a rich inflectional system. Although its morphological categories have been fairly stable over time, morphological changes are present throughout, particularly in the nominal and verbal systems. The major change in the nominal morphology since the classical stage was the disuse of the dative case (its functions being largely taken over by the genitive). The verbal system has lost the infinitive, the synthetically-formed future and perfect tenses and the optative mood. Many have been replaced by [[periphrastic]] (analytical) forms.\n\n==== Nouns and adjectives ====\nPronouns show distinctions in [[grammatical person|person]] (1st, 2nd, and 3rd), [[grammatical number|number]] (singular, dual, and plural in the ancient language; singular and plural alone in later stages), and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and decline for [[grammatical case|case]] (from six cases in the earliest forms attested to four in the modern language).{{NoteTag|The four cases that are found in all stages of Greek are the nominative, genitive, accusative and vocative. The dative/locative of Ancient Greek disappeared in the late Hellenistic period, and the instrumental case of Mycenaean Greek disappeared in the Archaic period.}} Nouns, articles and adjectives show all the distinctions except for person. Both attributive and predicative adjectives agree with the noun.\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThe inflectional categories of the Greek verb have likewise remained largely the same over the course of the language's history but with significant changes in the number of distinctions within each category and their morphological expression. Greek verbs have [[synthetic language|synthetic]] inflectional forms for:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! Ancient Greek\n! Modern Greek\n|-\n!

Most Greek linguists advocate abandoning the traditional terminology (Anna Roussou and Tasos Tsangalidis 2009, in ''Meletes gia tin Elliniki Glossa'', Thessaloniki, Anastasia Giannakidou 2009 \"Temporal semantics and polarity: The dependency of the subjunctive revisited\", Lingua); see [[Modern Greek grammar#The verb|Modern Greek grammar]] for explanation.}} and imperative (other modal functions are expressed by periphrastic constructions)\n|-\n! Voice\n| [[active voice|active]], [[middle voice|middle]], and [[passive voice|passive]]\n| active and [[mediopassive voice|medio-passive]]\n|}\n\n===Syntax===\nMany aspects of the [[syntax]] of Greek have remained constant: verbs agree with their subject only, the use of the surviving cases is largely intact (nominative for subjects and predicates, accusative for objects of most verbs and many prepositions, genitive for possessors), articles precede nouns, adpositions are largely prepositional, relative clauses follow the noun they modify and relative pronouns are clause-initial. However, the morphological changes also have their counterparts in the syntax, and there are also significant differences between the syntax of the ancient and that of the [[Modern Greek grammar|modern form of the language]]. Ancient Greek made great use of participial constructions and of constructions involving the infinitive, and the modern variety lacks the infinitive entirely (instead having a raft of new periphrastic constructions) and uses participles more restrictively. The loss of the dative led to a rise of prepositional indirect objects (and the use of the genitive to directly mark these as well). Ancient Greek tended to be verb-final, but neutral word order in the modern language is VSO or SVO.\n\n===Vocabulary===\nModern Greek inherits most of its vocabulary from Ancient Greek, which in turn is an Indo-European language, but also includes a number of [[Pre-Greek substrate|borrowings]] from the languages of the populations that inhabited Greece before the arrival of Proto-Greeks,<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|2009}}.</ref> some documented in [[Linear B|Mycenaean texts]]; they include a large number of Greek [[toponym]]s. The form and meaning of many words have evolved. [[Loanword]]s (words of foreign origin) have entered the language, mainly from [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Venetian language#History|Venetian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. During the older periods of Greek, loanwords into Greek acquired Greek inflections, thus leaving only a foreign root word.

It was created by modifying the [[Phoenician alphabet]], with the innovation of adopting certain letters to represent the [[vowel]]s. The variant of the alphabet in use today is essentially the late [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] variant, introduced for writing classical [[Attic Greek|Attic]] in 403 BC. In classical Greek, as in classical Latin, only upper-case letters existed. The lower-case Greek letters were developed much later by medieval scribes to permit a faster, more convenient cursive writing style with the use of [[ink]] and [[quill]].\n\nThe Greek alphabet consists of 24 letters, each with an uppercase ([[capital letter|majuscule]]) and lowercase ([[lower case|minuscule]]) form. The letter [[sigma]] has an additional lowercase form (\u03c2) used in the final position:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"33\" | [[upper case]]\n|-\n|[[Alpha|\u0391]]||[[Beta|\u0392]]||[[Gamma|\u0393]]||[[Delta (letter)|\u0394]]||[[Epsilon|\u0395]]||[[Zeta|\u0396]]||[[Eta|\u0397]]||[[Theta|\u0398]]||[[Iota|\u0399]]||[[Kappa|\u039a]]||[[Lambda|\u039b]]||[[Mu (letter)|\u039c]]||[[Nu (letter)|\u039d]]||[[Xi (letter)|\u039e]]||[[Omicron|\u039f]]||[[Pi (letter)|\u03a0]]||[[Rho|\u03a1]]||[[Sigma|\u03a3]]||[[Tau|\u03a4]]||[[Upsilon|\u03a5]]||[[Phi|\u03a6]]||[[Chi (letter)|\u03a7]]||[[Psi (letter)|\u03a8]]||[[Omega|\u03a9]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"33\" | [[lower case]]\n|-\n|\u03b1||\u03b2||\u03b3||\u03b4||\u03b5||\u03b6||\u03b7||\u03b8||\u03b9||\u03ba||\u03bb||\u03bc||\u03bd||\u03be||\u03bf||\u03c0||\u03c1||\u03c3<br />\u03c2||\u03c4||\u03c5||\u03c6||\u03c7||\u03c8||\u03c9\n|}\n\n====Diacritics====\n{{main|Greek diacritics}}\n\nIn addition to the letters, the Greek alphabet features a number of [[diacritic|diacritical signs]]: three different accent marks ([[acute accent|acute]], [[grave accent|grave]], and [[circumflex]]), originally denoting different shapes of [[pitch accent]] on the stressed vowel; the so-called breathing marks ([[rough breathing|rough]] and [[smooth breathing]]), originally used to signal presence or absence of word-initial /h/; and the [[trema (diacritic)|diaeresis]], used to mark full syllabic value of a vowel that would otherwise be read as part of a diphthong. These marks were introduced during the course of the Hellenistic period. Actual usage of the grave in [[penmanship|handwriting]] saw a rapid decline in favor of uniform usage of the acute during the late 20th century, and it has only been retained in [[typography]].\n\nAfter the writing reform of 1982, most diacritics are no longer used. Since then, Greek has been written mostly in the simplified [[Greek diacritics|monotonic orthography]] (or monotonic system), which employs only the acute accent and the diaeresis. The traditional system, now called the polytonic orthography (or polytonic system), is still used internationally for the writing of [[Ancient Greek]].\n\n====Punctuation====\nIn Greek, the question mark is written as the English semicolon, while the functions of the colon and semicolon are performed by a raised point (\u2022), known as the ''[[Interpunct#Ano teleia|ano teleia]]'' ({{lang|grc|\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1}}).

In the Ottoman Empire, the primary criterion for the selection of an alphabet in which to write was religion. Thus, people who did not speak\u2014or even know\u2014the official language of their religion used to write their religious texts in the languages that they knew, though in the alphabet where the sacred texts of that religion were written. Thus, the Grecophone Catholics of Chios wrote using the Latin alphabet, but in the Greek language (''[[frangochiotika]]''); the Turcophone Orthodox Christians of Cappadocia wrote their Turkish texts using the Greek alphabet (''[[karamanlidika]]''); and the Grecophone Muslims of the Greek peninsula wrote in Greek language using the Arabic alphabet (''[[tourkogianniotika]]'', ''[[tourkokretika]]''). Our case is much stranger, since it is a quite early example for that kind of literature and because it is largely concerned with religious themes.\"; p. 306. The audience for the Greek ''[[Mi'r\u0101jn\u0101ma]]'' was most certainly Greek-speaking Muslims, in particular the so-called ''[[Tourkogianniot]]es'' (literally, the Turks of Jannina). Although few examples have been discovered as yet, it seems that these people developed a religious literature mainly composed in verse form. This literary form constituted the mainstream of Greek ''[[Aljamiado]]'' literature from the middle of the seventeenth century until the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] in 1923. Tourkogianniotes were probably of Christian origin and were Islamized sometime during the seventeenth century. They did not speak any language other than Greek. Thus, even their frequency in attending mosque services did not provide them with the necessary knowledge about their faith. Given their low level of literacy, one important way that they could learn about their faith was to listen to religiously edifying texts such as the Greek ''Mi'r\u0101jn\u0101ma''.}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Greece|Language}}\n* [[Modern Greek]]\n** [[Varieties of Modern Greek]]\n* [[Medieval Greek]]\n* [[Ancient Greek]]\n** [[Ancient Greek dialects]]\n* [[Hellenic languages]]\n* [[List of Greek and Latin roots in English]]\n* [[List of medical roots, suffixes and prefixes]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Alexiou|first=Margaret|year=1982|chapter=Diglossia in Greece|pages=156\u2013192|editor-last=Haas|editor-first=William|title=Standard Languages: Spoken and Written|location=Manchester|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-389-20291-2|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sza8AAAAIAAJ |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Androutsopoulos|first=Jannis |chapter='Greeklish': Transliteration Practice and Discourse in a Setting of Computer-Mediated Digraphia|pages=221\u2013249|editor1-last=Georgakopoulou|editor1-first=Alexandra|editor2-last=Silk|editor2-first=Michael|title=Standard Languages and Language Standards: Greek, Past and Present|year=2009|location=Aldershot|publisher = Ashgate Publishing Limited |chapter-url = http://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/MEDIA139/\u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1/Androutsopoulos,Greeklish(2009).pdf |ref=harv }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* {{cite book |last1=Atkinson|first1=Quentin D. |last2=Gray|first2=Russel D. |editor1-last=Forster |editor1-first=Peter|editor2-last=Renfrew |editor2-first=Colin |chapter=Chapter 8: How Old is the Indo-European Language Family?

The unity of Proto-Greek would have ended as Hellenic migrants entered the [[Geography of Greece|Greek peninsula]] sometime in the [[Neolithic]] era or the [[Bronze Age]].{{NoteTag|A comprehensive overview in J.T.

It is recorded in the [[Linear B]] script on tablets dating from the 15th century BC onwards.\n* '''[[Ancient Greek]]''': in its various [[Ancient Greek dialects|dialects]], the language of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek civilization]]. It was widely known throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. Ancient Greek fell into disuse in western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], but remained officially in use in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] world and was reintroduced to the rest of Europe with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and [[Greeks|Greek]] migration to western Europe.\n* '''[[Koine Greek]]''': The fusion of [[Ionian Greek|Ionian]] with [[Attic Greek|Attic]], the dialect of [[Classical Athens|Athens]], began the process that resulted in the creation of the first common Greek dialect, which became a [[lingua franca]] across the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] and [[Near East]]. Koine Greek can be initially traced within the armies and conquered territories of [[Alexander the Great]] and after the Hellenistic colonization of the known world, it was spoken from [[Egypt]] to the fringes of [[India]]. After the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] conquest of Greece, an unofficial [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] of Greek and [[Latin]] was established in the city of [[Rome]] and Koine Greek became a first or second language in the [[Roman Empire]]. The origin of [[Christianity]] can also be traced through Koine Greek, because the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] used this form of the language to spread Christianity. It is also known as '''Hellenistic Greek''', '''New Testament Greek''', and sometimes '''Biblical Greek''' because it was the original language of the [[New Testament]] and the [[Old Testament]] was translated into the same language via the [[Septuagint]].\n[[File:Anatolian Greek dialects.png|thumb|Distribution of varieties of Greek in [[Anatolia]], 1910.

''Medieval Greek'' is a cover phrase for a whole continuum of different speech and writing styles, ranging from vernacular continuations of spoken Koine that were already approaching [[Modern Greek]] in many respects, to highly learned forms imitating classical Attic. Much of the written Greek that was used as the official language of the Byzantine Empire was an eclectic middle-ground variety based on the tradition of written Koine.\n* '''[[Modern Greek]]''' (Neo-Hellenic):<ref name=\"Ethnologue\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ell|title=Greek|website=Ethnologue|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Stemming from Medieval Greek, Modern Greek usages can be traced in the Byzantine period, as early as the 11th century. It is the language used by the modern Greeks, and, apart from Standard Modern Greek, there are several [[Varieties of Modern Greek|dialects]] of it.\n\n===Diglossia===\n{{Main|Greek language question}}\n\nIn the modern era, the Greek language entered a state of [[diglossia]]: the coexistence of vernacular and archaizing written forms of the language. What came to be known as the [[Greek language question]] was a polarization between two competing varieties of [[Modern Greek]]: [[Demotic Greek|Dimotiki]], the vernacular form of Modern Greek proper, and [[Katharevousa]], meaning 'purified', a compromise between Dimotiki and [[Ancient Greek]], which was developed in the early 19th century and was used for literary and official purposes in the newly formed Greek state. In 1976, Dimotiki was declared the official language of Greece, having incorporated features of Katharevousa and giving birth to [[Varieties of Modern Greek#Standard Modern Greek|Standard Modern Greek]], which is used today for all official purposes and in [[education in Greece|education]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The modern Greek language : a descriptive analysis of standard modern Greek|last=Peter|first=Mackridge|date=1985|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-815770-0|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire]|oclc=11134463}}</ref>\n\n===Historical unity===\n[[File:Modern Greek dialects en.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The distribution of major modern Greek dialect areas]]\n\nThe historical unity and continuing identity between the various stages of the Greek language is often emphasized. Although Greek has undergone morphological and phonological changes comparable to those seen in other languages, never since classical antiquity has its cultural, literary, and orthographic tradition been interrupted to the extent that one can speak of a new language emerging. Greek speakers today still tend to regard literary works of ancient Greek as part of their own rather than a foreign language.<ref>{{harvnb|Browning|1983}}.</ref> It is also often stated that the historical changes have been relatively slight compared with some other languages.

The division into conventional periods is, as with all such periodizations, relatively arbitrary, especially because at all periods, Ancient Greek has enjoyed high prestige, and the literate borrowed heavily from it.\n\n===Phonology===\n{{See also|Modern Greek phonology}}\n\n[[File:Seferisrede.ogg|thumb|Spoken [[Modern Greek]]]]\n\nAcross its history, the syllabic structure of Greek has varied little: Greek shows a mixed syllable structure, permitting complex syllabic onsets but very restricted codas. It has only oral vowels and a fairly stable set of consonantal contrasts. The main phonological changes occurred during the Hellenistic and Roman period (see [[Koine Greek phonology]] for details):\n* replacement of the [[pitch accent]] with a [[stress (linguistics)|stress accent]].\n* simplification of the system of [[vowel]]s and [[diphthong]]s: loss of vowel length distinction, monophthongisation of most diphthongs and several steps in a [[chain shift]] of vowels towards {{IPA|/i/}} ([[iotacism]]).\n* development of the [[voicelessness|voiceless]] [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] [[stop consonant|plosives]] {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}} and {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}} to the voiceless [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, respectively; the similar development of {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}} to {{IPA|/x/}} may have taken place later (the phonological changes are not reflected in the orthography, and both earlier and later phonemes are written with [[Phi (letter)|\u03c6]], [[Theta|\u03b8]], and [[Chi (letter)|\u03c7]]).\n* development of the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] plosives {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} to their voiced fricative counterparts {{IPA|/\u03b2/}} (later {{IPA|/v/}}), {{IPA|/\u00f0/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0263/}}.\n\n=== Morphology ===\nIn all its stages, the morphology of Greek shows an extensive set of productive derivational affixes, a limited but productive system of compounding<ref>{{harvnb|Ralli|2001|pp=164\u2013203}}.</ref> and a rich inflectional system. Although its morphological categories have been fairly stable over time, morphological changes are present throughout, particularly in the nominal and verbal systems. The major change in the nominal morphology since the classical stage was the disuse of the dative case (its functions being largely taken over by the genitive). The verbal system has lost the infinitive, the synthetically-formed future and perfect tenses and the optative mood. Many have been replaced by [[periphrastic]] (analytical) forms.\n\n==== Nouns and adjectives ====\nPronouns show distinctions in [[grammatical person|person]] (1st, 2nd, and 3rd), [[grammatical number|number]] (singular, dual, and plural in the ancient language; singular and plural alone in later stages), and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and decline for [[grammatical case|case]] (from six cases in the earliest forms attested to four in the modern language).{{NoteTag|The four cases that are found in all stages of Greek are the nominative, genitive, accusative and vocative. The dative/locative of Ancient Greek disappeared in the late Hellenistic period, and the instrumental case of Mycenaean Greek disappeared in the Archaic period.}} Nouns, articles and adjectives show all the distinctions except for person. Both attributive and predicative adjectives agree with the noun.\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThe inflectional categories of the Greek verb have likewise remained largely the same over the course of the language's history but with significant changes in the number of distinctions within each category and their morphological expression. Greek verbs have [[synthetic language|synthetic]] inflectional forms for:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! Ancient Greek\n! Modern Greek\n|-\n!

Most Greek linguists advocate abandoning the traditional terminology (Anna Roussou and Tasos Tsangalidis 2009, in ''Meletes gia tin Elliniki Glossa'', Thessaloniki, Anastasia Giannakidou 2009 \"Temporal semantics and polarity: The dependency of the subjunctive revisited\", Lingua); see [[Modern Greek grammar#The verb|Modern Greek grammar]] for explanation.}} and imperative (other modal functions are expressed by periphrastic constructions)\n|-\n! Voice\n| [[active voice|active]], [[middle voice|middle]], and [[passive voice|passive]]\n| active and [[mediopassive voice|medio-passive]]\n|}\n\n===Syntax===\nMany aspects of the [[syntax]] of Greek have remained constant: verbs agree with their subject only, the use of the surviving cases is largely intact (nominative for subjects and predicates, accusative for objects of most verbs and many prepositions, genitive for possessors), articles precede nouns, adpositions are largely prepositional, relative clauses follow the noun they modify and relative pronouns are clause-initial. However, the morphological changes also have their counterparts in the syntax, and there are also significant differences between the syntax of the ancient and that of the [[Modern Greek grammar|modern form of the language]]. Ancient Greek made great use of participial constructions and of constructions involving the infinitive, and the modern variety lacks the infinitive entirely (instead having a raft of new periphrastic constructions) and uses participles more restrictively. The loss of the dative led to a rise of prepositional indirect objects (and the use of the genitive to directly mark these as well). Ancient Greek tended to be verb-final, but neutral word order in the modern language is VSO or SVO.\n\n===Vocabulary===\nModern Greek inherits most of its vocabulary from Ancient Greek, which in turn is an Indo-European language, but also includes a number of [[Pre-Greek substrate|borrowings]] from the languages of the populations that inhabited Greece before the arrival of Proto-Greeks,<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|2009}}.</ref> some documented in [[Linear B|Mycenaean texts]]; they include a large number of Greek [[toponym]]s. The form and meaning of many words have evolved. [[Loanword]]s (words of foreign origin) have entered the language, mainly from [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Venetian language#History|Venetian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. During the older periods of Greek, loanwords into Greek acquired Greek inflections, thus leaving only a foreign root word. Modern borrowings (from the 20th century on), especially from [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]], are typically not inflected; other modern borrowings are derived from [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]/[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]) and [[Eastern Romance languages]] ([[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]]).\n\n===Greek loanwords in other languages===\n{{details|English words of Greek origin}}\n{{details|Greek and Latin roots in English}}\n\nGreek words have been widely borrowed into other languages, including English: ''[[mathematics]]'', ''[[physics]]'', ''[[astronomy]]'', ''[[democracy]]'', ''[[philosophy]]'', ''[[:wikt:athletics|athletics]], [[theatre]], [[rhetoric]]'', ''[[baptism]]'', ''[[:wikt:evangelist|evangelist]]'', etc. Moreover, Greek words and [[morpheme|word elements]] continue to be productive as a basis for coinages: ''[[anthropology]]'', ''[[photography]]'', ''[[telephony]]'', ''[[isomer]]'', ''[[biomechanics]]'', ''[[cinematography]]'', etc. and form, with [[Scientific Latin|Latin words]], the [[International scientific vocabulary|foundation of international scientific and technical vocabulary]] like all words ending with ''\u2013logy'' (\"discourse\").

It was created by modifying the [[Phoenician alphabet]], with the innovation of adopting certain letters to represent the [[vowel]]s. The variant of the alphabet in use today is essentially the late [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] variant, introduced for writing classical [[Attic Greek|Attic]] in 403 BC. In classical Greek, as in classical Latin, only upper-case letters existed. The lower-case Greek letters were developed much later by medieval scribes to permit a faster, more convenient cursive writing style with the use of [[ink]] and [[quill]].\n\nThe Greek alphabet consists of 24 letters, each with an uppercase ([[capital letter|majuscule]]) and lowercase ([[lower case|minuscule]]) form. The letter [[sigma]] has an additional lowercase form (\u03c2) used in the final position:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"33\" | [[upper case]]\n|-\n|[[Alpha|\u0391]]||[[Beta|\u0392]]||[[Gamma|\u0393]]||[[Delta (letter)|\u0394]]||[[Epsilon|\u0395]]||[[Zeta|\u0396]]||[[Eta|\u0397]]||[[Theta|\u0398]]||[[Iota|\u0399]]||[[Kappa|\u039a]]||[[Lambda|\u039b]]||[[Mu (letter)|\u039c]]||[[Nu (letter)|\u039d]]||[[Xi (letter)|\u039e]]||[[Omicron|\u039f]]||[[Pi (letter)|\u03a0]]||[[Rho|\u03a1]]||[[Sigma|\u03a3]]||[[Tau|\u03a4]]||[[Upsilon|\u03a5]]||[[Phi|\u03a6]]||[[Chi (letter)|\u03a7]]||[[Psi (letter)|\u03a8]]||[[Omega|\u03a9]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"33\" | [[lower case]]\n|-\n|\u03b1||\u03b2||\u03b3||\u03b4||\u03b5||\u03b6||\u03b7||\u03b8||\u03b9||\u03ba||\u03bb||\u03bc||\u03bd||\u03be||\u03bf||\u03c0||\u03c1||\u03c3<br />\u03c2||\u03c4||\u03c5||\u03c6||\u03c7||\u03c8||\u03c9\n|}\n\n====Diacritics====\n{{main|Greek diacritics}}\n\nIn addition to the letters, the Greek alphabet features a number of [[diacritic|diacritical signs]]: three different accent marks ([[acute accent|acute]], [[grave accent|grave]], and [[circumflex]]), originally denoting different shapes of [[pitch accent]] on the stressed vowel; the so-called breathing marks ([[rough breathing|rough]] and [[smooth breathing]]), originally used to signal presence or absence of word-initial /h/; and the [[trema (diacritic)|diaeresis]], used to mark full syllabic value of a vowel that would otherwise be read as part of a diphthong. These marks were introduced during the course of the Hellenistic period. Actual usage of the grave in [[penmanship|handwriting]] saw a rapid decline in favor of uniform usage of the acute during the late 20th century, and it has only been retained in [[typography]].\n\nAfter the writing reform of 1982, most diacritics are no longer used. Since then, Greek has been written mostly in the simplified [[Greek diacritics|monotonic orthography]] (or monotonic system), which employs only the acute accent and the diaeresis. The traditional system, now called the polytonic orthography (or polytonic system), is still used internationally for the writing of [[Ancient Greek]].\n\n====Punctuation====\nIn Greek, the question mark is written as the English semicolon, while the functions of the colon and semicolon are performed by a raised point (\u2022), known as the ''[[Interpunct#Ano teleia|ano teleia]]'' ({{lang|grc|\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1}}).

In the Ottoman Empire, the primary criterion for the selection of an alphabet in which to write was religion. Thus, people who did not speak\u2014or even know\u2014the official language of their religion used to write their religious texts in the languages that they knew, though in the alphabet where the sacred texts of that religion were written. Thus, the Grecophone Catholics of Chios wrote using the Latin alphabet, but in the Greek language (''[[frangochiotika]]''); the Turcophone Orthodox Christians of Cappadocia wrote their Turkish texts using the Greek alphabet (''[[karamanlidika]]''); and the Grecophone Muslims of the Greek peninsula wrote in Greek language using the Arabic alphabet (''[[tourkogianniotika]]'', ''[[tourkokretika]]''). Our case is much stranger, since it is a quite early example for that kind of literature and because it is largely concerned with religious themes.\"; p. 306. The audience for the Greek ''[[Mi'r\u0101jn\u0101ma]]'' was most certainly Greek-speaking Muslims, in particular the so-called ''[[Tourkogianniot]]es'' (literally, the Turks of Jannina). Although few examples have been discovered as yet, it seems that these people developed a religious literature mainly composed in verse form. This literary form constituted the mainstream of Greek ''[[Aljamiado]]'' literature from the middle of the seventeenth century until the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] in 1923. Tourkogianniotes were probably of Christian origin and were Islamized sometime during the seventeenth century. They did not speak any language other than Greek. Thus, even their frequency in attending mosque services did not provide them with the necessary knowledge about their faith.
