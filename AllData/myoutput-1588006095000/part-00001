Reliable global records of climate only began in the 1880s, and proxies provide the only means for scientists to determine climatic patterns before record-keeping began.\n\nExamples of proxies include stable isotope measurements from [[ice core]]s, growth rates in [[tree rings]], [[palynology|sub-fossil pollen]] in [[Sediment|lake and ocean sediments]], temperature profiles of [[borehole]]s, and isotope measurements in [[coral]]s and carbonate [[speleothems]]. Chemical traces (such as quantities of particular [[isotopes]]), species composition of fossils (such as pollen or diatoms), or the rate of growth preserved in annual layers (such as tree rings or corals) have been influenced by the climatic conditions at the time in which they were laid down or grew. Interpretation of climate proxies requires a range of ancillary studies, including calibration of the sensitivity of the proxy to climate and cross-verification among proxy indicators.<ref>[http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/068.htm \"Climate Change 2001: 2.3.2.1 Palaeoclimate proxy indicators.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204100159/http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=%2Fclimate%2Fipcc_tar%2Fwg1%2F068.htm |date=2009-12-04 }}</ref>\n\nProxies can be combined to produce temperature reconstructions longer than the [[instrumental temperature record]] and can inform discussions of [[global warming]] and climate history.

This can be done by \"proxy methods,\" in which a variable which correlates with the variable of interest is measured, and then used to infer the value of the variable of interest.  Proxy methods are of particular use in the study of the past climate, beyond times when direct measurements of temperatures are available.\n\nMost proxy records have to be calibrated against independent temperature measurements, or against a more directly calibrated proxy, during their period of overlap to estimate the relationship between temperature and the proxy. The longer history of the proxy is then used to reconstruct temperature from earlier periods.\n\n===Ice cores===\n\n====Drilling====\n\n[[Image:Icecore 4x.jpg|thumb|Ice Core sample taken from drill.

Tree rings are wider when conditions favor growth, narrower when times are difficult. Other properties of the annual rings, such as maximum latewood density (MXD) have been shown to be better proxies than simple ring width. Using tree rings, scientists have estimated many local climates for hundreds to thousands of years previous. By combining multiple tree-ring studies (sometimes with other climate proxy records), scientists have estimated past regional and global climates (see [[Temperature record of the past 1000 years]]).\n\n===Fossil leaves===\nPaleoclimatologists often use leaf teeth to reconstruct mean annual temperature in past climates, and they use leaf size as a proxy for mean annual precipitation.<ref>{{cite journal|volume=92|author=[[Dana L.

Since heat transfer through the ground is slow, temperature measurements at a series of different depths down the borehole, adjusted for the effect of rising heat from inside the Earth, can be \"[[Invertible matrix|inverted]]\" (a mathematical formula to solve matrix equations) to produce a non-unique series of surface temperature values. The solution is \"non-unique\" because there are multiple possible surface temperature reconstructions that can produce the same borehole temperature profile. In addition,  due to physical limitations, the reconstructions are inevitably \"smeared\", and become more smeared further back in time. When reconstructing temperatures around 1500 AD, boreholes have a temporal resolution of a few centuries. At the start of the 20th Century, their resolution is a few decades; hence they do not provide a useful check on the [[instrumental temperature record]].<ref name=\"Boreholes_in_Glacial_Ice_p80\">{{Cite book | url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11676&page=80 | doi=10.17226/11676| title=Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years| year=2006| isbn=978-0-309-10225-4| last1=Council| first1=National Research| last2=Studies| first2=Division on Earth Life| last3=Climate| first3=Board on Atmospheric Sciences and| last4=Committee On Surface Temperature Reconstructions For The Last 2| first4=000 Years| citeseerx=10.1.1.178.5968}}</ref><ref name=\"pollack et al\">{{cite journal|last1=Pollack|first1=H.

However, they record surface temperature not the near-surface temperature (1.5 meter) used for most \"surface\" weather observations. These can differ substantially under extreme conditions or when there is surface snow. In practice the effect on borehole temperature is believed to be generally small. A second source of error is contamination of the well by groundwater may affect the temperatures, since the water \"carries\" more modern temperatures with it. This effect is believed to be generally small, and more applicable at very humid sites.<ref name=\"Boreholes_in_Glacial_Ice_p80\" /> It does not apply in ice cores where the site remains frozen all year.\n\nMore than 600 boreholes, on all continents, have been used as proxies for reconstructing surface temperatures.<ref name =\"pollack et al\" /> The highest concentration of boreholes exist in [[North America]] and [[Europe]].

In 2002, a report was published on the findings of Drs. Lisa Greer and Peter Swart, associates of [[University of Miami]] at the time, in regard to [[Isotopes of oxygen|stable oxygen isotopes]] in the [[calcium carbonate]] of coral. Cooler temperatures tend to cause coral to use heavier isotopes in its structure, while warmer temperatures result in more normal [[oxygen isotopes]] being built into the coral structure. Denser water [[salinity]] also tends to contain the heavier isotope. Greer's coral sample from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] was taken in 1994 and dated back to 1935. Greer recalls her conclusions, \"When we look at the averaged annual data from 1935 to about 1994, we see it has the shape of a [[sine wave]]. It is periodic and has a significant pattern of [[oxygen isotope]] composition that has a peak at about every twelve to fifteen years.\" [[Sea surface temperature|Surface water temperatures]] have coincided by also peaking every twelve and a half years.

Plants produce [[pollen]] in large quantities and it is extremely resistant to decay. It is possible to identify a plant species from its pollen grain. The identified plant community of the area at the relative time from that sediment layer, will provide information about the climatic condition. The abundance of pollen of a given [[vegetation]] period or year depends partly on the weather conditions of the previous months, hence pollen density provides information on short-term climatic conditions.<ref>Bradley, R.

Proxy methods are of particular use in the study of the past climate, beyond times when direct measurements of temperatures are available.\n\nMost proxy records have to be calibrated against independent temperature measurements, or against a more directly calibrated proxy, during their period of overlap to estimate the relationship between temperature and the proxy.

Using tree rings, scientists have estimated many local climates for hundreds to thousands of years previous.

Since heat transfer through the ground is slow, temperature measurements at a series of different depths down the borehole, adjusted for the effect of rising heat from inside the Earth, can be \"[[Invertible matrix|inverted]]\" (a mathematical formula to solve matrix equations) to produce a non-unique series of surface temperature values. The solution is \"non-unique\" because there are multiple possible surface temperature reconstructions that can produce the same borehole temperature profile. In addition,  due to physical limitations, the reconstructions are inevitably \"smeared\", and become more smeared further back in time. When reconstructing temperatures around 1500 AD, boreholes have a temporal resolution of a few centuries. At the start of the 20th Century, their resolution is a few decades; hence they do not provide a useful check on the [[instrumental temperature record]].<ref name=\"Boreholes_in_Glacial_Ice_p80\">{{Cite book | url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11676&page=80 | doi=10.17226/11676| title=Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years| year=2006| isbn=978-0-309-10225-4| last1=Council| first1=National Research| last2=Studies| first2=Division on Earth Life| last3=Climate| first3=Board on Atmospheric Sciences and| last4=Committee On Surface Temperature Reconstructions For The Last 2| first4=000 Years| citeseerx=10.1.1.178.5968}}</ref><ref name=\"pollack et al\">{{cite journal|last1=Pollack|first1=H.

However, they record surface temperature not the near-surface temperature (1.5 meter) used for most \"surface\" weather observations. These can differ substantially under extreme conditions or when there is surface snow. In practice the effect on borehole temperature is believed to be generally small. A second source of error is contamination of the well by groundwater may affect the temperatures, since the water \"carries\" more modern temperatures with it. This effect is believed to be generally small, and more applicable at very humid sites.<ref name=\"Boreholes_in_Glacial_Ice_p80\" /> It does not apply in ice cores where the site remains frozen all year.\n\nMore than 600 boreholes, on all continents, have been used as proxies for reconstructing surface temperatures.<ref name =\"pollack et al\" /> The highest concentration of boreholes exist in [[North America]] and [[Europe]].

In 2002, a report was published on the findings of Drs. Lisa Greer and Peter Swart, associates of [[University of Miami]] at the time, in regard to [[Isotopes of oxygen|stable oxygen isotopes]] in the [[calcium carbonate]] of coral. Cooler temperatures tend to cause coral to use heavier isotopes in its structure, while warmer temperatures result in more normal [[oxygen isotopes]] being built into the coral structure. Denser water [[salinity]] also tends to contain the heavier isotope. Greer's coral sample from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] was taken in 1994 and dated back to 1935. Greer recalls her conclusions, \"When we look at the averaged annual data from 1935 to about 1994, we see it has the shape of a [[sine wave]]. It is periodic and has a significant pattern of [[oxygen isotope]] composition that has a peak at about every twelve to fifteen years.\" [[Sea surface temperature|Surface water temperatures]] have coincided by also peaking every twelve and a half years. However, since recording this temperature has only been practiced for the last fifty years, correlation between recorded water temperature and coral structure can only be drawn so far back.<ref>[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/view.php?id=22843 \"Coral Layers Good Proxy for Atlantic Climate Cycles.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316220809/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/view.php?id=22843 |date=2010-03-16 }}</ref>\n\n===Pollen grains===\nPollen can be found in sediments. Plants produce [[pollen]] in large quantities and it is extremely resistant to decay. It is possible to identify a plant species from its pollen grain. The identified plant community of the area at the relative time from that sediment layer, will provide information about the climatic condition. The abundance of pollen of a given [[vegetation]] period or year depends partly on the weather conditions of the previous months, hence pollen density provides information on short-term climatic conditions.<ref>Bradley, R.

In [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]] (VSMOW) the ratio of D to H is 155.76x10<sup>\u22126</sup> and O-18 to O-16 is 2005.2x10<sup>\u22126</sup>.  [[Isotope fractionation]] occurs during changes between condensed and vapour phases: the vapour pressure of heavier isotopes is lower, so vapour contains relatively more of the lighter isotopes and when the vapour condenses the precipitation preferentially contains heavier isotopes.  The difference from VSMOW is expressed as \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O = 1000\u2030 <math display=\"inline\">\\times \\left( \\frac{([{}^{18}O]/[{}^{16}O])}{([{}^{18}O]/[{}^{16}O])_{\\mathrm{VSMOW}}} - 1\\right)</math>; and a similar formula for \u03b4D. \u03b4 values for precipitation are always negative.<ref>{{Cite book | url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11676&page=66 | doi=10.17226/11676| title=Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years| year=2006| isbn=978-0-309-10225-4| last1=Council| first1=National Research| last2=Studies| first2=Division on Earth Life| last3=Climate| first3=Board on Atmospheric Sciences and| last4=Committee On Surface Temperature Reconstructions For The Last 2| first4=000 Years| citeseerx=10.1.1.178.5968}}</ref>  The major influence on \u03b4 is the difference between ocean temperatures where the moisture evaporated and the place where the final precipitation occurred; since ocean temperatures are relatively stable the \u03b4 value mostly reflects the temperature where precipitation occurs.
