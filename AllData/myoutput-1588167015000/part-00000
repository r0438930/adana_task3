It is about a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from [[Chorleywood station]] but there are buses from the station and [[Watford]].

The school had a well-known choir which featured in a 1975 [[EMI]] recording (ASD 3117) of [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'', conducted by [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]] with the [[London Symphony Orchestra|LSO]] (and chorus).

On the move to Hertfordshire, the school reverted to six houses, with Clare and Essex not being reintroduced until 2005.\n\n==Commemoration==\nEvery year a commemoration service is held in [[St Clement Danes]] Church in London to commemorate the beginning of the school. It is a large celebration, in which the orchestra and choir play a big part. Half of the school visit the church in London, whilst the other half undergo a service held at the school in Chorleywood.
