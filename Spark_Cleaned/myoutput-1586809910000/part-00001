STURP issued its final report in 1981.\n\nJoe Nickell of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] has pointed out that \"STURP\u2019s leaders served on the executive council of the Holy Shroud Guild, which is devoted to the \u201ccause\u201d of the reputed relic.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Nickell|first=Joe|title=Fake Turin Shroud Deceives National Geographic Author|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/fake_turin_shroud_deceives_national_geographic_author|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|date=April 23, 2015|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe origins of the group go back to the experiments of physicist [[John P. Jackson]], thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern in 1976. Using the ideas invented in aerospace science for building three dimensional models from images of Mars, Eric Jumper built initial devices to test the photographs of the Shroud of Turin. These were the first experiments relating to the shroud performed by scientists.<ref>Bernard Ruffin, 1999, ''The Shroud of Turin'' {{ISBN|0-87973-617-8}}-page 79</ref>\n\nIn March 1977, Jackson, Jumper and Mottern invited a few other scientists to join them to form a team for the analysis of the Shroud. The first meeting took place in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]]. The group had no official sponsorship and the scientists funded their own activities. They also managed to arrange gifts and loans of technical equipment whose value was estimated at over $2&nbsp;million.\n\nNuclear physicist Tom D'Muhala headed STURP. Apart from Jackson, Jumper, and Motten the team included thermal chemist [[Raymond N. Rogers]], and Ron London, and Roger Morris, all from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. Other team members included Don Lynn of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in Pasadena, biophysicist John Heller, photographers Vern Miller and Barrie Schwortz, optical physicist Sam Pellicori, and electric power experts John D. German and Rudy Dichtl, as well as forensic pathologist Robert Bucklin. STURP included no experts on medieval art, archaeology, or textiles.\n\nTo commemorate the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the shroud in [[Turin]], it was displayed to the public in Turin from 27 August to 8 October 1978, with about 3 million visitors attending the exposition under bullet-proof glass. For the next 5 days after the exposition the STURP team analyzed the shroud around the clock at the royal palace adjoining Turin Cathedral, some scientists sleeping while others worked. A team of European scientists headed by Luigi Gonella supervised the activities.<ref>Bernard Ruffin, 1999, ''The Shroud of Turin'' {{ISBN|0-87973-617-8}}-page 80-83</ref> The team gathered sticky tape samples of material from several points on the surface of the shroud.<ref>''The orphaned manuscript: a gathering of publications on the Shroud of Turin'' by Alan D.
