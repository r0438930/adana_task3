The coin was designed by [[Chester Beach]]. Its [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] depicts the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', flagship of [[Henry Hudson]], after whom the city of [[Hudson, New York]] is named. In addition to showing the ship, the coin displays a version of the Hudson city seal, with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] riding a whale, a design that has drawn commentary over the years.\n\nAlthough the city of Hudson was a relatively small municipality, legislation to issue a coin in honor of its 150th anniversary went through Congress without opposition and was signed by President [[Franklin D.

In June 1935, 10,000 Hudson half dollars were distributed to civic authorities for sale to the public.\n\nMost of the coins were likely bought by coin dealers, leaving few for collectors, with the result that prices spiked from the $1 cost at the time of issue.

Moore suggested [[Laura Gardin Fraser]] as standing in the first rank of medallists, with other possibilities to include Mint Chief Engraver [[John R. Sinnock]], [[Paul Manship]], Francis H. Packer and [[Chester Beach]]. Mayor Frank Wise of Hudson asked if [[John Flanagan (sculptor)|John Flanagan]], who had recently designed the [[Washington quarter]], would do; Moore agreed by telegram. However, the commission went to Beach for $1,000; the sculptor also agreed to guide the city through the coin approval process.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v\u2013vi, 161}}\n\nWise and his officials had tentatively decided to have a head of [[Henry Hudson]] on one side of the coin, with the city seal on the other. Beach quickly prepared sketches and met with Wise on May 13, but convinced the mayor that instead of the explorer (no actual portrait of him is known) his ship, the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', would be a better choice. Working at speed unusual for a commemorative coin of that era, Beach completed plaster models in one week, adding a crescent moon to the left of the ship. The models were converted to coinage dies by the [[Medallic Art Company]] of New York, who could accomplish the task faster than the [[Philadelphia Mint]]. Though records are not complete, the company apparently contacted the Mint for advice; Chief Engraver Sinnock sent it a letter on May 23. While unfamiliar with the Hudson legislation, Sinnock had confidence in Beach's ability because his previous designs were easy for the Mint to strike into coins. Beach quoted this praise in reporting to Moore on May 27 that [[Lee Lawrie]], the sculptor-member of the Commission of Fine Arts, had approved the designs. Approval by the full commission followed on May 28, and by Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]] a week later.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=161\u2013166}}\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the coin shows the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', Henry Hudson's flagship, sailing to the right. To the left of the [[Cargo ship|merchantman]]'s rigging is a stylized crescent moon. The ship is surrounded with two rings of lettering, the inner reading \"[[In God We Trust|{{small|IN GOD WE TRUST}}]]\" and {{small|HUDSON}}, and the outer the name of the country and the coin's denomination. The designer's monogram, {{small|CB}}, may be found at the waterline on the left side of the coin. The reverse is a rendition of the city of Hudson's seal, with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] holding a trident, riding backward on a whale. A mermaid or [[Triton (mythology)|triton]] in the background blows into a conch shell.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=249\u2013250}} The seal design reflects Hudson's heritage as a whaling port, although it is some distance up the [[Hudson River]] from the ocean.{{sfn|Taxay|p=166}} The motto {{small|ED DECUS ET PRETIUM RECTI}} (''Both the honor and the reward of the righteous'') is copied from the city seal; the name of the city and the anniversary dates surround the seal, with [[E pluribus unum|{{small|E PLURIBUS UNUM}}]] above the dates.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=250}}\n\n[[Don Taxay]], in his book on commemorative coins, described the seal as \"a rather whimsical composition\";{{sfn|Taxay|p=161}} Beach had deemed it \"rather amusing\" and had hoped the new coins \"will be a little more interesting than the others I have done\".{{sfn|Taxay|p=165}} Swiatek and Breen referenced \"the quaint device of King Neptune riding backwards on a spouting whale, whose eye is represented as being about where its blowhole should be. Neptune is briefly clad in a wisp of cloth 'blowing in the wind'.\"{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=101}} They suggested that the position of the Moon meant, if it was waxing, that the ship was sailing west toward America, but if waning, was sailing east to Europe.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=101}}\n\nArt historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume about U.S. coins and medals, considered the ship on the obverse \"straightforward fare for commemorative half-dollars\", though he found the name \"{{small|HUDSON}}\" beneath the waves unneeded given the legend on the reverse.{{sfn|Vermeule|p=189}} The reverse based on the city seal was to him \"a harming throwback to colonial days, and in American numismatics to the quasi\u2013federal and state issues of the period 1780 to 1792\".{{sfn|Vermeule|p=189}} Vermeule noted \"the baroque motto above Neptune and his group [that] makes it evident that this subject, appealing and amusing in itself, appears here because it is the singular characteristic of the City of Hudson on the river of the same name\".{{sfn|Vermeule|p=190}}\n\n== Production, distribution, and collecting ==\n{{quote box | align = right | width = 30em | salign = right\n| quote = So far as known, this piece is the first ever dedicated to the coin collector. Everything about it shows the purpose for which it was issued. Behold, on the obverse, the ship of Hudson homeward bound in all its triumph.

But, ah! the reverse\u2014can it really be the devil himself? Be still, my troubled heart, 'tis only the captain of the great ''Half Moon'' jauntily sporting his workaday clothes!

Shornlamb\", ''[[The Numismatist]]'', February 1936, p. 109.{{sfn|Bowers|p=297}}}}\n\nOn June 12, 1935, John Evans, vice president of the First National Bank of Hudson, wrote to [[Mary M. O'Reilly]], the acting Director of the Mint, asking on behalf of Mayor Wise that only 6,000 coins be struck at that time, with the remainder to be coined later if demand justified it.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=282\u2013283}} But the Mint delivered the entire authorization of 10,000 on June 28. Reservations for coins had been taken since early May (at $1 per coin, plus postage of $.03 per two coins and [[registered mail]] fee of $.18 per order), and on July 2, Evans, who was in charge of distribution, began informing what Swiatek called \"[i]nfuriated collectors\" that the coins were sold out.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=250}} Coin dealer Julius Guttag, of New York City's Guttag Brothers, is believed to have bought 7,500 coins at $.95 each, with Hubert W. Carcaba, of Saint Augustine, Florida, believed to have bought 1,000.{{sfn|Bowers|p=295}} In addition to the 10,000 pieces distributed, eight coins were struck at Philadelphia and retained there to be available for inspection and testing at the 1936 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Swiatek|p=249}}\n\nThe uproar in the coin-collecting community resulted in bad publicity for the city of Hudson. Although the specifics of how the coins came to be so quickly sold out were not immediately known, collectors intuited a trick, especially when coins proved plentiful on the market at between $5 and $7 each. Many of these sold, helping set off a commemorative coin boom that would continue later in 1935 when low-mintage varieties of the [[Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar]] came on the market after a similar immediate sellout. But collectors wrote angry letters to numismatic societies and periodicals, and the Hudson piece was among those that future [[American Numismatic Association]] president L. W. Hoffecker complained about to Congress when he testified in March 1936. By 1940, the price on the secondary market had dropped back to $5.50, but thereafter rose steadily and reached $1,700 during the commemorative coin boom of 1980.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=295\u2013299}} The 2017 edition of [[R. S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'' lists the coin for between $700 and $1,500, depending on condition.{{sfn|Yeoman 2017|p=305}} A near-pristine specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $15,275.{{sfn|Yeoman 2015|p=1147}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bowers\n  | first = Q.

Though records are not complete, the company apparently contacted the Mint for advice; Chief Engraver Sinnock sent it a letter on May 23. While unfamiliar with the Hudson legislation, Sinnock had confidence in Beach's ability because his previous designs were easy for the Mint to strike into coins. Beach quoted this praise in reporting to Moore on May 27 that [[Lee Lawrie]], the sculptor-member of the Commission of Fine Arts, had approved the designs. Approval by the full commission followed on May 28, and by Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]] a week later.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=161\u2013166}}\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the coin shows the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', Henry Hudson's flagship, sailing to the right. To the left of the [[Cargo ship|merchantman]]'s rigging is a stylized crescent moon. The ship is surrounded with two rings of lettering, the inner reading \"[[In God We Trust|{{small|IN GOD WE TRUST}}]]\" and {{small|HUDSON}}, and the outer the name of the country and the coin's denomination. The designer's monogram, {{small|CB}}, may be found at the waterline on the left side of the coin. The reverse is a rendition of the city of Hudson's seal, with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] holding a trident, riding backward on a whale. A mermaid or [[Triton (mythology)|triton]] in the background blows into a conch shell.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=249\u2013250}} The seal design reflects Hudson's heritage as a whaling port, although it is some distance up the [[Hudson River]] from the ocean.{{sfn|Taxay|p=166}} The motto {{small|ED DECUS ET PRETIUM RECTI}} (''Both the honor and the reward of the righteous'') is copied from the city seal; the name of the city and the anniversary dates surround the seal, with [[E pluribus unum|{{small|E PLURIBUS UNUM}}]] above the dates.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=250}}\n\n[[Don Taxay]], in his book on commemorative coins, described the seal as \"a rather whimsical composition\";{{sfn|Taxay|p=161}} Beach had deemed it \"rather amusing\" and had hoped the new coins \"will be a little more interesting than the others I have done\".{{sfn|Taxay|p=165}} Swiatek and Breen referenced \"the quaint device of King Neptune riding backwards on a spouting whale, whose eye is represented as being about where its blowhole should be. Neptune is briefly clad in a wisp of cloth 'blowing in the wind'.\"{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=101}} They suggested that the position of the Moon meant, if it was waxing, that the ship was sailing west toward America, but if waning, was sailing east to Europe.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=101}}\n\nArt historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume about U.S. coins and medals, considered the ship on the obverse \"straightforward fare for commemorative half-dollars\", though he found the name \"{{small|HUDSON}}\" beneath the waves unneeded given the legend on the reverse.{{sfn|Vermeule|p=189}} The reverse based on the city seal was to him \"a harming throwback to colonial days, and in American numismatics to the quasi\u2013federal and state issues of the period 1780 to 1792\".{{sfn|Vermeule|p=189}} Vermeule noted \"the baroque motto above Neptune and his group [that] makes it evident that this subject, appealing and amusing in itself, appears here because it is the singular characteristic of the City of Hudson on the river of the same name\".{{sfn|Vermeule|p=190}}\n\n== Production, distribution, and collecting ==\n{{quote box | align = right | width = 30em | salign = right\n| quote = So far as known, this piece is the first ever dedicated to the coin collector. Everything about it shows the purpose for which it was issued. Behold, on the obverse, the ship of Hudson homeward bound in all its triumph. Is it not laden, oh, my friends, with the catch of a most profitable expedition to the Sea of Suckers, where the proverbial one is born every minute?{{nbsp}}... But, ah! the reverse\u2014can it really be the devil himself? Be still, my troubled heart, 'tis only the captain of the great ''Half Moon'' jauntily sporting his workaday clothes! Caught, too, in the very act of administering the coup-de-grace to the poor sucker that was snared into his trap. Another unsuspecting sucker may be seen nearby awaiting his turn and blowing his trumpet in anticipation of what he believes to be his great moment.\n| source = \"A. Shornlamb\", ''[[The Numismatist]]'', February 1936, p. 109.{{sfn|Bowers|p=297}}}}\n\nOn June 12, 1935, John Evans, vice president of the First National Bank of Hudson, wrote to [[Mary M. O'Reilly]], the acting Director of the Mint, asking on behalf of Mayor Wise that only 6,000 coins be struck at that time, with the remainder to be coined later if demand justified it.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=282\u2013283}} But the Mint delivered the entire authorization of 10,000 on June 28. Reservations for coins had been taken since early May (at $1 per coin, plus postage of $.03 per two coins and [[registered mail]] fee of $.18 per order), and on July 2, Evans, who was in charge of distribution, began informing what Swiatek called \"[i]nfuriated collectors\" that the coins were sold out.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=250}} Coin dealer Julius Guttag, of New York City's Guttag Brothers, is believed to have bought 7,500 coins at $.95 each, with Hubert W. Carcaba, of Saint Augustine, Florida, believed to have bought 1,000.{{sfn|Bowers|p=295}} In addition to the 10,000 pieces distributed, eight coins were struck at Philadelphia and retained there to be available for inspection and testing at the 1936 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Swiatek|p=249}}\n\nThe uproar in the coin-collecting community resulted in bad publicity for the city of Hudson. Although the specifics of how the coins came to be so quickly sold out were not immediately known, collectors intuited a trick, especially when coins proved plentiful on the market at between $5 and $7 each. Many of these sold, helping set off a commemorative coin boom that would continue later in 1935 when low-mintage varieties of the [[Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar]] came on the market after a similar immediate sellout. But collectors wrote angry letters to numismatic societies and periodicals, and the Hudson piece was among those that future [[American Numismatic Association]] president L. W. Hoffecker complained about to Congress when he testified in March 1936. By 1940, the price on the secondary market had dropped back to $5.50, but thereafter rose steadily and reached $1,700 during the commemorative coin boom of 1980.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=295\u2013299}} The 2017 edition of [[R. S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'' lists the coin for between $700 and $1,500, depending on condition.{{sfn|Yeoman 2017|p=305}} A near-pristine specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $15,275.{{sfn|Yeoman 2015|p=1147}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bowers\n  | first = Q.
