Clausewitz was well educated and had strong interests in art, history, science, and education.  He was a professional soldier who spent a considerable part of his life fighting against Napoleon.

Others disagree and state that he was a physiologist at heart and wanted to understand how and why people wanted to go to war and fight others.\n\nSome of the key ideas (not necessarily original to Clausewitz or even to his mentor [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]]) discussed in ''On War'' include<ref>This list is from \"[https://www.clausewitzstudies.org/mobile/faqs.htm#Ideas Frequently Asked Questions about Clausewitz],\" ''ClausewitzStudies.org'', edited by Christopher Bassford.</ref> (in no particular order of importance):\n\n* the [[Dialectic|dialectical approach]] to military analysis\n* the methods of \"critical analysis\"\n* the uses and abuses of historical studies\n* the nature of the balance-of-power mechanism\n* the relationship between political objectives and military objectives in war\n* the asymmetrical relationship between attack and defense\n* the nature of \"military genius\"\n* the \"fascinating trinity\" (''Wunderliche Dreifaltigkeit'') of war\n* philosophical distinctions between \"absolute or ideal war,\" and \"real war\"\n* in \"real war,\" the distinctive poles of a) limited war and b) war to \"render the enemy helpless\"\n* \"war\" belongs fundamentally to the social realm, rather than the realms of art or science\n* \"strategy\" belongs primarily to the realm of art\n* \"tactics\" belongs primarily to the realm of science\n* the essential unpredictability of war\n* the \"[[fog of war]]\"\n* \"friction\"\n* strategic and operational \"[[Center of gravity (military)|centers of gravity]]\"\n* the \"[[culminating point]] of the offensive\"\n* the \"culminating point of victory\"\n\nClausewitz used a dialectical method to construct his argument, leading to frequent modern misinterpretation because he explores various\u2014often opposed\u2014ideas before coming to conclusions.\n\nModern perceptions of war are based on the concepts Clausewitz put forth in ''On War'', though these have been diversely interpreted by various leaders (e.g., [[Moltke the Elder|Moltke]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Mao Zedong]], etc.), thinkers, armies, and peoples.  Modern military doctrine, organization, and norms are all based on Napoleonic premises, even to this day\u2014though whether these premises are necessarily also \"Clausewitzian\" is debatable.\n\nThe \"dualism\" of Clausewitz's view of war (i.e., that wars can vary a great deal between the two \"poles\" he proposed, based on the political objectives of the opposing sides and the context) seems simple enough, but few commentators have proven willing to accept this crucial variability\u2014they insist that Clausewitz \"really\" argued for one end of the scale or the other. ''On War'' has been seen by some prominent critics as an argument for \"[[total war]]\".{{Ref label|A|a|none}} \n\nIt has been blamed for the level of destruction involved in the [[World War I|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, but it seems rather that Clausewitz (who did not actually use the term \"total war\") had merely foreseen the inevitable development that started with the huge, patriotically motivated armies of the Napoleonic wars. These wars resulted (though war's evolution has not yet ended) in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with all the forces and capabilities of the state devoted to destroying forces and capabilities of the enemy state (thus \"total war\"). Conversely, Clausewitz  has also been seen as \"The preeminent military and political strategist of limited war in modern times.\" (Robert Osgood, 1979)\n\nClausewitz and his proponents have been severely criticized by competing theorists\u2014[[Antoine-Henri Jomini]] in the 19th century, [[B.

H. Liddell Hart]] stated that \"Civilization might have been spared much of the damage suffered in the world wars of this century if the influence of Clausewitz's monumental tome ''On War'', which molded European military thought in the era preceding the First World War, had been blended with and balanced by a knowledge of Sun Tzu's exposition on ''The Art of War.''\"  This comment is tempered by the comment that the \"ill-effects of Clausewitz's teaching arose largely from his disciples' too shallow and too extreme interpretation of it,\" but it remains an influential criticism.
