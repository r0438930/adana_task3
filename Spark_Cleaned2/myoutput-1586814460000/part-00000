Elsewhere, Karthik (Nikhil), a medical student who does not believe in super natural powers, falls in love with Valli (Swati); however, she keeps avoiding him every time he tries to get closer to her because of his father's reputation in Village. Meanwhile, Karthik and his friends are asked to go set up a medical camp in Subramaniapuram and Karthik is surprised to see that Valli is also part of the same camp as her Hometown.

And slowly, this fear turns into a legend which keeps everyone away from the temple for almost a year. Elsewhere, Karthik (Nikhil), a medical student who does not believe in super natural powers, falls in love with Valli (Swati); however, she keeps avoiding him every time he tries to get closer to her because of his father's reputation in Village. Meanwhile, Karthik and his friends are asked to go set up a medical camp in Subramaniapuram and Karthik is surprised to see that Valli is also part of the same camp as her Hometown.
