Sub-types include the \"[[Bombshell (slang)|blonde bombshell]]\" and the \"'''dumb blonde'''\". Blondes are differently stereotyped from [[brown hair|brunettes]] as more desirable and less intelligent. There are many [[blonde joke]]s made on these premises. Although chiefly aimed at women, jokes of this style have also been aimed at similar stereotypes associated with men, such as the \"[[Jock (stereotype)|dumb jock]]\" and the \"[[surfer]] dude\". \n\n==Background==\nThere are several aspects to the [[stereotype|stereotypical]] perception of [[blonde]]-[[hair]]ed women.<ref name=\"Post\">Hornaday, Ann (May 4, 2014) \"In Praise of the Dumb Blonde\" ''The Washington Post'', page E14.
