They live in their hometown of Urbania, [[Ohio]]. Kevin coaches the local \"Pee-Wee Cowboys\" football team.  Despite being the best player, Danny's tomboy daughter, Becky, nicknamed Icebox, is cut during try outs because she is a girl. Also cut are her less-talented friends, Rashid Hanon (who can't catch anything), Tad Simpson (who can't run), and Rudy Zolteck (who's overweight and quite [[flatulence|flatulent]]). After being ridiculed by the players who made the team, she convinces her dad to coach a new pee-wee team of their own.\n\nAt first, Danny is reluctant to do so, but later accepts in an attempt to show Urbania that Kevin is not invincible, and that there is another O'Shea in town capable of winning. Kevin mockingly reminds him of the \"one town, one team\" rule and with the help of the locals, they decide to have a playoff game to determine the lone team that will represent Urbania. Alongside Becky, Hanon, Tad, Rudy, and Nubie (an intelligent boy who becomes assistant coach), Danny also gathers other children that have never been given a chance and dubs the team the \"Little Giants.\" One such player is Junior Floyd, a strong-armed quarterback who turns out to be the son of Danny's childhood crush, Patty Floyd. Becky slowly develops a crush on him and struggles with her newfound feelings as a girl.\n\nTwo local old-timers, Orville and Wilbur, encourage the rivalry between Danny and Kevin by reporting to them that a new star player, Spike Hammersmith, has just moved to Urbania. Danny succeeds at recruiting him by tricking his overzealous father, Mike, that he is the famous \"Coach O'Shea\", but Spike proves to be rude, arrogant, and refuses to play on a team with a girl. The deception is later discovered and he switches over to Kevin's more well-structured team. Kevin also encourages his daughter, Debbie, to become a cheerleader and later convinces Becky that a quarterback will want to date a cheerleader, not a teammate. Believing it is her best chance to win over Junior, she decides to quit the team and pursue cheerleading.\n\nJust as Danny's team start to lose hope, a bus arrives carrying NFL stars [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]], [[Emmitt Smith]], [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]], [[Tim Brown (American football)|Tim Brown]], and [[Steve Emtman]]. They teach and inspire the young players into believing they can win.\n\nOn the day of the game, Kevin goads Danny into making an impulsive bet: If Danny wins, he gets Kevin's Chevrolet dealership; if Kevin wins, he gets Danny's gas station. Facing a 21-point halftime deficit, the Giants are lifted when Danny asks them to individually recall a time when they had a proud accomplishment and reassures them that all it takes is \"one time\" to beat the Cowboys. With this, they begin to make a big comeback with a series of outstanding and unexpected plays. Realizing that Junior is the main threat to them, Spike, under orders from his father, injures him by spearing him with his helmet after the whistle, which even Kevin considers disgraceful, unsportsmanlike conduct. \n\nWitnessing from the sidelines, an enraged Becky drops her pompoms and suits up for the game. She immediately makes an impact when she forces a fumble after a jarring hit on Spike. Other Giants make touchdowns in tandem with overcoming personal problems, such as Hanon's fear of dropping passes and making a reception, or another one running towards the end zone in excitement when he sees his little-seen dad has rushed back from a business trip to watch him play. In the game's closing seconds with the score tied at 21 all, the Giants make a goal line stand when Becky stops Spike. With time remaining for one final play, their offense steps back onto the field and uses a trick play Nubie calls \"[[Fumblerooski|The Annexation of Puerto Rico]],\" inspired by one of Madden's plays at [[Super Bowl XI]]. Kevin shouts out its actual name as it occurs, shouting \"Fumblerooski, Fumblerooski!\" The play includes three different ball carriers, utilizing the [[hook and lateral]] from Zolteck, to Junior, and finally to Berman, who scores the Giants' 99 yard game-winning touchdown.\n\nAfterwards, Danny suggests that rather than having the Giants solely represent Urbania, they should merge with the Cowboys, and both he and Kevin can coach the team. Danny and Patty rekindle their childhood romance. He also decides not to hold Kevin to the prior bet, on the stipulation that the town water tower be changed from \"Home of Kevin O'Shea\" to \"Home of The O'Shea Brothers,\" reflecting a much earlier promise that Kevin made to Danny from their childhood.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Rick Moranis]] - Danny O'Shea\n** Justin Jon Ross as Young Danny \n*[[Ed O'Neill]] - Kevin O'Shea\n**Travis Robertson as Young Kevin \n*[[Shawna Waldron]] - Becky \"Icebox\" O'Shea\n*[[Susanna Thompson]] - Patty Floyd\n** Janna Michaels as Young Patty \n*[[Devon Sawa]] - Junior Floyd\n*[[Brian Haley]] - Mike Hammersmith\n*Sam Horrigan - Spike Hammersmith \n*Joe Bays - Coach Harold Butz\n** Austin Kottke as Young Butz \n*Frank Carl Fisher Jr. - Patterson\n*[[Mary Ellen Trainor]] - Karen O'Shea\n*[[Courtney Peldon]] - Debbie O'Shea\n*[[Alexa Vega]] - Priscilla O'Shea\n*Danny Pritchett - Tad Simpson\n*[[Todd Bosley]] - Jake Berman\n*[[Mark Holton]] - Mr. Zolteck\n*Matthew McCurley - Nubie\n*Joey Simmirin - Sean Murphy\n*[[Jon Paul Steuer]] - Johnny \"Viper\" Vennaro\n*Troy Simmons - Rashid \"Hot Hands\" Hanon\n*[[Marcus Toji]] - Marcus \"The Toe\"\n*[[Pat Crawford Brown]] - Louise\n*[[Harry Shearer]] - Announcer Littbarski\t\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was inspired by a 1992 [[McDonald's]] [[Super Bowl]] commercial developed by Jim Ferguson and Bob Shallcross.
