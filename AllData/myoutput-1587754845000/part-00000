He was the voice of [[Pete Puma]] in the 1952 cartoon ''[[Rabbit's Kin]]'', in which he did an impression of an early [[Frank Fontaine]] characterization (which later became Fontaine's \"Crazy Guggenheim\" character).{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nFreberg voiced the character of Junyer Bear, but the role was actually created by actor [[Kent Rogers]] in ''[[Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears]]'' (1944){{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}. After Rogers was killed during [[World War II]], Freberg assumed the role of Junyer Bear in [[Chuck Jones]]' [[Looney Tunes]] cartoon ''What's Brewin', Bruin?'' (1948).

He also succeeded Rogers as the voice of [[Beaky Buzzard]].\n\nFreberg was heard in many Warner Brothers cartoons, but his only{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} screen credit on one was ''[[Three Little Bops]]'' (1957). His work as a voice actor for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] included the role of Mr. Busy the Beaver in ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955) and did voice work in ''[[Susie the Little Blue Coupe]]'' and ''[[Lambert the Sheepish Lion]]''. Freberg also provided the voice of Sam, the orange cat paired with [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] in the Academy Award-nominated short ''[[Mouse and Garden]]'' (1960). He voiced Cage E.

In 1957, as TV \"champagne music\" master [[Lawrence Welk]]'s [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV show gained popularity nationwide, Freberg released \"Wun'erful, Wun'erful!

In the parody, the orchestra is overwhelmed by the malfunctioning bubble machine and the entire Aragon Ballroom eventually floats out to sea.

On his radio show, an extended sketch paralleled the [[Cold War]] [[brinkmanship]] between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union]] by portraying an ever-escalating [[public relations]] battle between the [[Sodom and Gomorrah|El Sodom and the Rancho Gomorrah]], two [[casino]]s in the city of Los Voraces (Spanish for \"The Greedy Ones\"\u2014a thinly disguised [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]).

The \"suspect\" being investigated was the black sheep from the nursery rhyme, \"[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]\". (Butler: \"I would be suspicious of anyone who tried to rhyme ''dame'' with ''lane''.\")  Capitol's legal department was very nervous. Freberg describes being called in for a chat with Robert Karp, the department head, and being asked whether he had ever belonged to any group that might get attention from McCarthy.

Both recordings eventually surfaced on a [[box-set]] Freberg retrospective issued by [[Rhino Records]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nFreberg continued to skewer the advertising industry after the demise of his show, producing and recording \"[[Green Christmas (Stan Freberg song)|Green Chri$tma$]]\" in 1958, a scathing indictment of the over-commercialization of the holiday, in which Butler soberly hoped instead that we'd remember \"[[Jesus|Whose]] birthday we're celebrating\". The satire ended abruptly with a rendition of \"Jingle Bells\" punctuated by cash register sounds. The original version was somewhat longer when it was first released in 1958, but in later years Capitol did not reissue the full recording.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  Freberg also revisited the \"Dragnet\" theme, with \"Yulenet\", also known as \"Christmas Dragnet\", in which the strait-laced detective convinces a character named \"Grudge\" that Santa Claus really exists (and Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and the Easter Bunny, but Grudge still hadn't made up his mind yet about Toledo). Butler does several voices on that record.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n===''Oregon!

This was followed by the show itself, which runs for 21 minutes. Side two includes separate individual versions of each of the featured songs, including several variations on the title piece, ''Oregon!

He records a song called \"High School OO OO\", which lasted only a few seconds. (Noting this, Ankle asks, \"Kind of a short song, isn't it?\"  To which the producer answers, \"Gets more airplay that way.\")  The flip side was, \"I Was on My Way to High School\" (complete with fake audience noise from a \"scream machine\"). The promoter then tries to bribe a disc jockey at a jazz station to play the song on the air, which he flatly refuses, suspecting that the promoter was never in the music business in the first place. Afterward, a song in the big band style heralds the end of rock and roll and a resurgence of swing and jazz. Freberg's record was on the Hot 100 only the week of Leap Day 1960, at #99, about three and a half months after [[Tommy Facenda]]'s multi-versioned \"High School U.S.A.\" peaked at #28. [[Alan Freed]], whose career fell prey to charges of payola, reportedly laughed at Freberg's interpretation of the scandal.\n\n''[[Stan Freberg Presents The United States of America Volume One The Early Years|Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America, Volume One: The Early Years]]'' (1961) combined dialogue and song in a musical theatre format. The original [[album musical]], released on Capitol, parodies the history of the United States from 1492 until the end of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] in 1783. In it, Freberg parodied both large and small aspects of history. For instance, in the Colonial era, it was common to use the [[long s]], which resembles a lowercase f, in the middle of words; thus, as Ben Franklin is reading the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], he questions the passage, \"Life, liberty, and the ''[[Long s|purfuit of happineff]]?!?''\" Most of that particular sketch is a satire of McCarthyism. For example, Franklin remarks, \"You...sign a harmless petition, and forget all about it. Ten years later, you get hauled up before a committee.\"\n\nThe album also featured the following exchange, where Freberg's [[Christopher Columbus]] is \"discovered on beach here\" by a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] played by [[Marvin Miller (actor)|Marvin Miller]]. Skeptical of the Natives' diet of corn and \"other organically grown vegetables\", Columbus wants to open \"America's first Italian restaurant\" and needs to cash a check to get started:\n{{quote|\nNative: \"You out of luck, today. Banks closed.\"<br />\nColumbus: [archly, knowing what the response will be] \"Oh?

His portrayals of jazz musicians were usually stereotypical \"[[beatnik]]\" types, but jazz was always portrayed as preferable to [[popular music|pop]], [[Calypso music|calypso]], and particularly the then-new form of music, [[rock and roll]]. He whopped doo-wop in his version of \"[[Sh-Boom]]\" and lampooned [[Elvis Presley]] with an echo/reverb rendition of \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\".<ref name=pc7/>  ''The United States of America'' includes a sketch involving the musicians in the painting ''[[Archibald MacNeal Willard#The Spirit of '76|The Spirit of '76]]''. The terribly hip fife player (\"Bix\", played by Freberg) and the younger drummer (played by [[Walter Tetley]]) argue with the older, impossibly square drummer (\"Doodle\", also voiced by Freberg) over how \"[[Yankee Doodle]]\" should be performed.\n\n== Radio ==\n[[File:Stan Freberg and Gong.jpg|thumb|left|Theater for the ear: Freberg strikes a pose, 1962]]\n\nThe popularity of Freberg's recordings landed him his own program, the situation comedy ''That's Rich''. Freberg portrayed bumbling but cynical Richard E. Wilt, a resident of Hope Springs, where he worked for B.B. Hackett's Consolidated Paper Products Company. Freberg suggested the addition of dream sequences, which made it possible for him to perform his more popular Capitol Records satires before a live studio audience. The [[CBS]] series aired from January 8 to September 23, 1954.\n\n''[[The Stan Freberg Show]]'' was a 1957 replacement for Jack Benny on CBS radio. The satirical show, produced by Pete Barnum, featured elaborate production, and included most of the team he used on his Capitol recordings, including Foray, Leeds, and Butler. Billy May arranged and conducted the music. The Jud Conlon Singers, who had also appeared on Freberg recordings, were regulars, as was singer Peggy Taylor, who later that year participated in his \"Wun'erful, Wun'erful!\" two-sided 45, recorded to capitalize on the response it received on the show.\n\nThe show failed to attract a sponsor after Freberg decided he did not want to be associated with the tobacco companies that had sponsored Benny. In lieu of actual commercials, Freberg mocked advertising by touting such products as \"Puffed Grass\" (\"It's good for Bossie, it's good for me and you!\"), \"Food\" (\"Put some food in your tummy-tum-tum!\"), and himself (\"Stan Freberg\u2014the foaming comedian! Bobba-bobba-bom-bom-bom\"), a parody of the well-known [[Ajax (cleanser)|Ajax cleanser]] commercial.\n\nThe lack of sponsorship was not the only issue. Freberg frequently complained of radio network interference. Another sketch from the CBS show, \"Elderly Man River\", anticipated the [[political correctness]] movement by decades. Butler plays \"Mr. Tweedly\", a representative of a fictional citizens' radio review board, who constantly interrupts Freberg with a loud buzzer as Freberg attempts to sing \"[[Ol' Man River|Old Man River]]\". Tweedly objects first to the word \"old\", \"which some of our more ''elderly'' citizens find distasteful\". As a result, the song's lyrics are progressively and painfully distorted as Freberg struggles to turn the classic song into a form that Tweedly will find acceptable \"to the tiny tots\" listening at home: \"He don't, er, ''doesn't'' plant 'taters, er, ''potatoes''\u2026 he doesn't plant cotton, er, ''cotting''\u2026 and them-these-those that plants them are soon ''forgotting''\", a lyric of which Freberg is particularly proud. Even when the censor finds Freberg's machinations acceptable, the constant interruption ultimately brings the song to a grinding halt (just before Freberg would have had to edit the line \"You gets a little drunk and you lands in jail\"), saying, \"Take your finger off the button, Mr. Tweedly\u2014we know when we're licked\", furnishing the moral and the punch line of the sketch at once. But all of these factors forced the cancellation of the show after a run of only 15 episodes.\n\nIn 1966, he recorded an album, ''Freberg Underground'', in a format similar to his radio show, using the same cast and orchestra. He called it \"pay radio\", in a parallel to the phrase [[pay TV]] (the nickname at the time for subscription-based cable and broadcast television) \"\u2026because you have to go into the record store and buy it\". This album is notable for giving Dr. [[Edward Teller]] the ''Father of the Year'' award for being \"father of the [[hydrogen bomb]]\" (\"Use it in good health!\"); for lampooning all-digit dialing (\"They Took Away Our Murray Hills\"); and for a combined satire (\"The Flak-man and Reagan\") of the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series and the 1966 California Governor's race between [[Pat Brown|Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], in which the idea of Reagan in the future running for U.S. president and winning, was used in song as a final, over-the-top gag. The album is probably most famous for a bit in which, through the magic of [[sound effects]], Freberg drained [[Lake Michigan]] and refilled it with [[hot chocolate]] and a mountain of [[whipped cream]] while a giant [[maraschino cherry]] was dropped like a bomb by the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] to the cheers of 25,000 extras viewing from the shoreline.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppZ57EeX6vE| title = The Tip of the Freberg: The Stan Freberg Collection 1951\u20131998: Stretching the Imagination\n| accessdate = September 17, 2019\n| quote = [audio excerpt from Stretching the Imagination]\n}}</ref> Freberg concluded with, \"Let's see them do that on television!\" That bit became one of several commercials Freberg wrote to promote radio advertising, sometimes tagged with a jazzy jingle sung by Sara Vaughn.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyenSyjSr7k|title=Stan Freberg - \"Who Listens to Radio?\" Featuring Sarah Vaughan and Quincy Jones|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nFreberg returned to radio in several episodes of [[The Twilight Zone (radio series)|The Twilight Zone radio dramas]] in the early 2000s, including \"The Brain Center at Whipple's,\" \"Four O'Clock,\" \"The Fugitive,\" \"Gentlemen, Be Seated,\" \"Kick the Can,\" \"The Masks,\" and \"Static.\"\n\n== Television ==\n<!-- deleted file removed [[File:Dawsandstan.jpg|thumb|[[Daws Butler]] and Stan Freberg backstage in 1950, doing both voices and puppeteering on ''Time for Beany'' (1949\u201354).

Freberg also provided the voice of Sam, the orange cat paired with [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] in the Academy Award-nominated short ''[[Mouse and Garden]]'' (1960). He voiced Cage E.

In the parody, the orchestra is overwhelmed by the malfunctioning bubble machine and the entire Aragon Ballroom eventually floats out to sea.

On his radio show, an extended sketch paralleled the [[Cold War]] [[brinkmanship]] between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union]] by portraying an ever-escalating [[public relations]] battle between the [[Sodom and Gomorrah|El Sodom and the Rancho Gomorrah]], two [[casino]]s in the city of Los Voraces (Spanish for \"The Greedy Ones\"\u2014a thinly disguised [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]).

The \"suspect\" being investigated was the black sheep from the nursery rhyme, \"[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]\". (Butler: \"I would be suspicious of anyone who tried to rhyme ''dame'' with ''lane''.\")  Capitol's legal department was very nervous.

Both recordings eventually surfaced on a [[box-set]] Freberg retrospective issued by [[Rhino Records]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nFreberg continued to skewer the advertising industry after the demise of his show, producing and recording \"[[Green Christmas (Stan Freberg song)|Green Chri$tma$]]\" in 1958, a scathing indictment of the over-commercialization of the holiday, in which Butler soberly hoped instead that we'd remember \"[[Jesus|Whose]] birthday we're celebrating\". The satire ended abruptly with a rendition of \"Jingle Bells\" punctuated by cash register sounds. The original version was somewhat longer when it was first released in 1958, but in later years Capitol did not reissue the full recording.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  Freberg also revisited the \"Dragnet\" theme, with \"Yulenet\", also known as \"Christmas Dragnet\", in which the strait-laced detective convinces a character named \"Grudge\" that Santa Claus really exists (and Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and the Easter Bunny, but Grudge still hadn't made up his mind yet about Toledo). Butler does several voices on that record.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n===''Oregon!

This was followed by the show itself, which runs for 21 minutes. Side two includes separate individual versions of each of the featured songs, including several variations on the title piece, ''Oregon!

He records a song called \"High School OO OO\", which lasted only a few seconds. (Noting this, Ankle asks, \"Kind of a short song, isn't it?\"  To which the producer answers, \"Gets more airplay that way.\")  The flip side was, \"I Was on My Way to High School\" (complete with fake audience noise from a \"scream machine\"). The promoter then tries to bribe a disc jockey at a jazz station to play the song on the air, which he flatly refuses, suspecting that the promoter was never in the music business in the first place. Afterward, a song in the big band style heralds the end of rock and roll and a resurgence of swing and jazz. Freberg's record was on the Hot 100 only the week of Leap Day 1960, at #99, about three and a half months after [[Tommy Facenda]]'s multi-versioned \"High School U.S.A.\" peaked at #28. [[Alan Freed]], whose career fell prey to charges of payola, reportedly laughed at Freberg's interpretation of the scandal.\n\n''[[Stan Freberg Presents The United States of America Volume One The Early Years|Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America, Volume One: The Early Years]]'' (1961) combined dialogue and song in a musical theatre format. The original [[album musical]], released on Capitol, parodies the history of the United States from 1492 until the end of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] in 1783. In it, Freberg parodied both large and small aspects of history. For instance, in the Colonial era, it was common to use the [[long s]], which resembles a lowercase f, in the middle of words; thus, as Ben Franklin is reading the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], he questions the passage, \"Life, liberty, and the ''[[Long s|purfuit of happineff]]?!?''\" Most of that particular sketch is a satire of McCarthyism. For example, Franklin remarks, \"You...sign a harmless petition, and forget all about it. Ten years later, you get hauled up before a committee.\"\n\nThe album also featured the following exchange, where Freberg's [[Christopher Columbus]] is \"discovered on beach here\" by a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] played by [[Marvin Miller (actor)|Marvin Miller]]. Skeptical of the Natives' diet of corn and \"other organically grown vegetables\", Columbus wants to open \"America's first Italian restaurant\" and needs to cash a check to get started:\n{{quote|\nNative: \"You out of luck, today. Banks closed.\"<br />\nColumbus: [archly, knowing what the response will be] \"Oh?

His portrayals of jazz musicians were usually stereotypical \"[[beatnik]]\" types, but jazz was always portrayed as preferable to [[popular music|pop]], [[Calypso music|calypso]], and particularly the then-new form of music, [[rock and roll]]. He whopped doo-wop in his version of \"[[Sh-Boom]]\" and lampooned [[Elvis Presley]] with an echo/reverb rendition of \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\".<ref name=pc7/>  ''The United States of America'' includes a sketch involving the musicians in the painting ''[[Archibald MacNeal Willard#The Spirit of '76|The Spirit of '76]]''. The terribly hip fife player (\"Bix\", played by Freberg) and the younger drummer (played by [[Walter Tetley]]) argue with the older, impossibly square drummer (\"Doodle\", also voiced by Freberg) over how \"[[Yankee Doodle]]\" should be performed.\n\n== Radio ==\n[[File:Stan Freberg and Gong.jpg|thumb|left|Theater for the ear: Freberg strikes a pose, 1962]]\n\nThe popularity of Freberg's recordings landed him his own program, the situation comedy ''That's Rich''. Freberg portrayed bumbling but cynical Richard E. Wilt, a resident of Hope Springs, where he worked for B.B. Hackett's Consolidated Paper Products Company. Freberg suggested the addition of dream sequences, which made it possible for him to perform his more popular Capitol Records satires before a live studio audience. The [[CBS]] series aired from January 8 to September 23, 1954.\n\n''[[The Stan Freberg Show]]'' was a 1957 replacement for Jack Benny on CBS radio. The satirical show, produced by Pete Barnum, featured elaborate production, and included most of the team he used on his Capitol recordings, including Foray, Leeds, and Butler. Billy May arranged and conducted the music. The Jud Conlon Singers, who had also appeared on Freberg recordings, were regulars, as was singer Peggy Taylor, who later that year participated in his \"Wun'erful, Wun'erful!\" two-sided 45, recorded to capitalize on the response it received on the show.\n\nThe show failed to attract a sponsor after Freberg decided he did not want to be associated with the tobacco companies that had sponsored Benny. In lieu of actual commercials, Freberg mocked advertising by touting such products as \"Puffed Grass\" (\"It's good for Bossie, it's good for me and you!\"), \"Food\" (\"Put some food in your tummy-tum-tum!\"), and himself (\"Stan Freberg\u2014the foaming comedian! Bobba-bobba-bom-bom-bom\"), a parody of the well-known [[Ajax (cleanser)|Ajax cleanser]] commercial.\n\nThe lack of sponsorship was not the only issue. Freberg frequently complained of radio network interference. Another sketch from the CBS show, \"Elderly Man River\", anticipated the [[political correctness]] movement by decades. Butler plays \"Mr. Tweedly\", a representative of a fictional citizens' radio review board, who constantly interrupts Freberg with a loud buzzer as Freberg attempts to sing \"[[Ol' Man River|Old Man River]]\". Tweedly objects first to the word \"old\", \"which some of our more ''elderly'' citizens find distasteful\". As a result, the song's lyrics are progressively and painfully distorted as Freberg struggles to turn the classic song into a form that Tweedly will find acceptable \"to the tiny tots\" listening at home: \"He don't, er, ''doesn't'' plant 'taters, er, ''potatoes''\u2026 he doesn't plant cotton, er, ''cotting''\u2026 and them-these-those that plants them are soon ''forgotting''\", a lyric of which Freberg is particularly proud. Even when the censor finds Freberg's machinations acceptable, the constant interruption ultimately brings the song to a grinding halt (just before Freberg would have had to edit the line \"You gets a little drunk and you lands in jail\"), saying, \"Take your finger off the button, Mr. Tweedly\u2014we know when we're licked\", furnishing the moral and the punch line of the sketch at once. But all of these factors forced the cancellation of the show after a run of only 15 episodes.\n\nIn 1966, he recorded an album, ''Freberg Underground'', in a format similar to his radio show, using the same cast and orchestra. He called it \"pay radio\", in a parallel to the phrase [[pay TV]] (the nickname at the time for subscription-based cable and broadcast television) \"\u2026because you have to go into the record store and buy it\". This album is notable for giving Dr. [[Edward Teller]] the ''Father of the Year'' award for being \"father of the [[hydrogen bomb]]\" (\"Use it in good health!\"); for lampooning all-digit dialing (\"They Took Away Our Murray Hills\"); and for a combined satire (\"The Flak-man and Reagan\") of the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series and the 1966 California Governor's race between [[Pat Brown|Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], in which the idea of Reagan in the future running for U.S. president and winning, was used in song as a final, over-the-top gag. The album is probably most famous for a bit in which, through the magic of [[sound effects]], Freberg drained [[Lake Michigan]] and refilled it with [[hot chocolate]] and a mountain of [[whipped cream]] while a giant [[maraschino cherry]] was dropped like a bomb by the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] to the cheers of 25,000 extras viewing from the shoreline.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppZ57EeX6vE| title = The Tip of the Freberg: The Stan Freberg Collection 1951\u20131998: Stretching the Imagination\n| accessdate = September 17, 2019\n| quote = [audio excerpt from Stretching the Imagination]\n}}</ref> Freberg concluded with, \"Let's see them do that on television!\" That bit became one of several commercials Freberg wrote to promote radio advertising, sometimes tagged with a jazzy jingle sung by Sara Vaughn.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyenSyjSr7k|title=Stan Freberg - \"Who Listens to Radio?\" Featuring Sarah Vaughan and Quincy Jones|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nFreberg returned to radio in several episodes of [[The Twilight Zone (radio series)|The Twilight Zone radio dramas]] in the early 2000s, including \"The Brain Center at Whipple's,\" \"Four O'Clock,\" \"The Fugitive,\" \"Gentlemen, Be Seated,\" \"Kick the Can,\" \"The Masks,\" and \"Static.\"\n\n== Television ==\n<!-- deleted file removed [[File:Dawsandstan.jpg|thumb|[[Daws Butler]] and Stan Freberg backstage in 1950, doing both voices and puppeteering on ''Time for Beany'' (1949\u201354).
