Her son Timothy is ill with pneumonia just as the farmer Mr. Fitzgibbon begins preparation for spring plowing in the garden where the Frisby family lives. Normally she would move her family, but Timothy would not survive the cold trip to their summer home. Mrs. Frisby obtains medicine from her friend Mr. Ages, an older white mouse. On the return journey, she saves the life of Jeremy, a young crow, from Dragon, the farmer's cat\u2013 the same cat who killed her husband, Jonathan. Jeremy suggests she seek help in moving Timothy from an owl who dwells in the forest. Jeremy flies Mrs. Frisby to the owl's tree, but the owl says he cannot help until he finds out that she is the widow of Jonathan Frisby. He suggests that Mrs. Frisby seek help from the rats who live in a rosebush near her.\n\nMrs. Frisby discovers the rats have a literate and mechanized society. They have technology such as elevators, have tapped the electricity grid to provide lighting and heating and have acquired other human skills, such as storing food for the winter. Their leader, Nicodemus, tells Mrs. Frisby of the rats' capture by scientists working for a laboratory located at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) and the subsequent experiments that the humans performed on the rats, which increased the rats' intelligence to the point of being able to read, write and operate complicated machines, as well as enhancing their longevity and strength. This increased intelligence and strength allowed them to escape from the NIMH laboratories and migrate to their present location. Jonathan Frisby and Mr. Ages were the only two survivors of a group of eight [[mice]] who had been part of the experiments at NIMH and made the rats' escape possible. Out of their respect and unending gratitude for Jonathan, the rats agree to move Mrs. Frisby's house to a location safe from the plow.\n\nNicodemus also tells Mrs. Frisby about \"The Plan\", which is to abandon their lifestyle of dependence on humans, which some rats regard as theft, for a new, independent farming colony. One rat, Jenner, disagreed vehemently with The Plan and left the colony with a group of followers at some point prior to Mrs. Frisby's arrival.\n\nTo move the Frisby home, the rats have to drug Dragon, as it is too dangerous to work in the open with the cat wandering nearby. However, Mr. Ages has a broken leg and cannot dash to Dragon's bowl to put in the drug. Since the rats are too big to fit into the hole in the wall to enter the house, Mrs. Frisby volunteers to go. Unfortunately, she is caught by the family's son, Billy, who puts her in a cage. While captured, Mrs. Frisby overhears the Fitzgibbons discussing an incident at a nearby hardware store in which a group of rats was electrocuted after seemingly attempting to steal a small motor. This has attracted the attention of a group of men who have offered to exterminate the rat colony on Fitzgibbons' land free of charge for him.\n\nAt night, the rat Justin comes to save Mrs. Frisby and manages to get her out of the cage. Mrs. Frisby warns Justin of what she learned while captured; they assume that the rats at the hardware store were all from Jenner's group and that the group of men were from NIMH and are looking for them specifically.\n\nThe successful house move allows the mouse family to remain so that Timothy has time to recover before moving to their summer home. Although the rats have not yet had time to move everything they needed for The Plan, they manage to destroy their underground rooms and create the vision that they are just regular rats by placing rubbish in the remaining rooms. As the others move, ten rats stay back so the exterminators would not think the rat hole has been abandoned. When the exterminators fill the rat hole with toxic gas, eight of the ten rats manage to escape, while two rats die in the hole. It is not revealed exactly who these two are.\n\nOnce Timothy recovers, Mrs. Frisby and her family move to their summer home and Mrs. Frisby tells her children the full story of their father and the rats of NIMH.\n\n==Reception==\nIn a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1966 to 1975, children's author [[John Rowe Townsend]] wrote, \"It seems to me that the fact that all the animals talk and behave intelligently from the beginning of the story detracts from the spectacular development of the laboratory rats... ''Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH'' is a pleasing book, but I find it mildly frustrating; it might have been something more than it is.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Townsend |first=John Rowe |authorlink=John Rowe Townsend |chapter=A Decade of Newbery Books in Perspective |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newberycaldecott0000unse/page/148 148-149] |title=Newbery and Caldecott Medal Books: 1966-1975 |editor-last=Kingman |editor-first=Lee |publisher=[[The Horn Book Magazine|The Horn Book, Incorporated]] |location=[[Boston]] |year=1975 |isbn=0-87675-003-X |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/newberycaldecott0000unse/page/148 }}</ref>\n\n==Related works==\nAfter his death, O'Brien's daughter, [[Jane Leslie Conly]], wrote two other novels based on the rats of NIMH. ''[[Racso and the Rats of NIMH]]'' tells the story of a city rat who runs away to join the new colony, befriending Timothy, while saving the colony from a flood along the way. In ''[[R-T, Margaret, and the Rats of NIMH]]'', the rats rescue two lost human children who in turn help to save the colony before winter.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\nIn 1982, the animated film ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' was released, directed by [[Don Bluth]]. The film adds a mystical element completely absent from the novel, with Nicodemus portrayed as a wise, bearded old wizard with magic powers and an enchanted amulet, rather than an equal of the other rats. The character of Jenner is made a villain who is still present with the rats, rather than having left them before the story begins. The crow Jeremy has much greater prominence as [[comic relief]] in the film than he has in the book. Additionally, the Frisby family name was changed to \"Brisby\" to avoid trademark infringement with the [[Frisbee]].<ref name=\"cawley_tail\">{{cite book |last=Cawley |first=John |title=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |date=October 1991 |chapter=The Secret of N.I.M.H. |publisher=Image Pub of New York |isbn=0-685-50334-8 |chapter-url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBnimh.html}}</ref>\n\n'''In production'''\n\nIn July 2009, [[Paramount Pictures]] set [[Neil Burger]] to write the script and [[Cary Granat]] to produce the film based on the book.<ref>{{cite news|last1=O.|first1=Courtney|title=Paramount Set for ''Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH''|url=http://www.movieweb.com/paramount-set-for-mrs-frisby-and-the-rats-of-nimh|accessdate=March 9, 2015|website=movieweb|date=July 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, 2015, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], which had released the 1982 film, acquired the rights to the book to adapt it into a live-action/animated film.
