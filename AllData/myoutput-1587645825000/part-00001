It is a [[remake]] of Ozu's own [[black-and-white]] [[silent film]] ''[[A Story of Floating Weeds]]'' (1934).\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place during a hot [[summer]] in 1958 at a seaside town on the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]]. A travelling theatre troupe arrives by ship, headed by the troupe's lead actor and owner, Komajuro ([[Ganjir\u014d Nakamura]]). The rest of the troupe goes around the town to publicise their appearance.\n\nKomajuro visits his former mistress, Oyoshi, who runs a small eatery in the town. They have a grown-up son, Kiyoshi, who works at the [[post office]] as a mail clerk and is saving up to study at the [[university]]. However, he does not know who Komajuro is, having been told he is his uncle. Komajuro invites Kiyoshi to go fishing by the sea.\n\nWhen Sumiko, the lead actress of the troupe and Komajuro's present girlfriend, learns that Komajuro is visiting his former mistress, she becomes jealous and makes a visit to Oyoshi's eatery, where Kiyoshi and Komajuro are playing a game of [[Go (game)|go]]. Komajuro brusquely chases her away before she can say anything too calamitous, then confronts her in the pouring rain. He tells her to back off from his son, and decides to break up with her. Sumiko calls Komajuro an ingrate, and reminds him of the times she has helped him out in the past.\n\nBackstage one day, Sumiko offers Kayo, a pretty young actress from the same troupe, some money and asks her to seduce Kiyoshi. Although Kayo is at first reluctant, she gives in after Sumiko's insistence, without being told why. She goes to Kiyoshi's post office to make him fall for her. However, after knowing Kiyoshi for some time, she falls for him and decides to tell Kiyoshi the truth about how their relationship started. Kiyoshi is undaunted and says it does not matter to him, and eventually their relationship is discovered by Komajuro.\n\nKomajuro confronts Kayo, who tells him of Sumiko's setup, but only after asserting she now loves Kiyoshi and is not doing it for money. Komajuro has a violent confrontation with Sumiko and tells her he does not want to see her again. She pleads for reconciliation, but he is indignant.\n\nAmid Komajuro's personal dramas, the troupe's old-fashioned [[kabuki]]-style performances fail to attract the town's residents. The other actors pursue their own romantic diversions at local businesses, including a brothel and a barber shop. As audiences decline, problems pile up: the manager of the troupe abandons them, and a principal supporting player absconds with the remaining funds. Komajuro has no choice but to disband the troupe, and they meet for a melancholy last night together. Komajuro then goes to Oyoshi's place and tells her of his troupe's break-up. Oyoshi persuades him to tell Kiyoshi the truth about his parenthood and then stay together with them at her place as a family. After some discussion, Komajuro agrees.\n\nWhen Kiyoshi later comes back with Kayo, Komajuro becomes so enraged to see them together that he beats both of them repeatedly, leading to a physical tussle between Kiyoshi and him, ending with Kiyoshi pushing him towards a table. To stifle the brawl, Oyoshi reveals to him the truth about Komajuro. Kiyoshi first responds that he had suspected it all along, but then refuses to accept Komajuro as his father, saying he has coped well without one so far, and goes to his room upstairs. Taking in Kiyoshi's reaction, Komajuro decides to leave after all. Kayo wants to join Komajuro to help him achieve success for the family, but a chastened Komajuro asks her to stay to help make Kiyoshi a fine man, as was always Komajuro's hope. Kiyoshi later has a change of heart and goes downstairs to look for Komajuro, but his father has already left, and Oyoshi tells Kiyoshi to let him go.\n\nAt the train station in town, Komajuro tries to light a cigarette but has no matches. Sumiko, who is sitting nearby, comes up and offers him a light. Sumiko asks where Komajuro is going, and asks to accompany him, since she now has no place to go. The two reconcile and Sumiko decides to join Komajuro to start anew under another [[impresario]] at [[Kuwana]]. The last scene of the film shows Komajuro, tended by Sumiko, in a train heading for Kuwana.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ganjir\u014d Nakamura]] - Komajuro (troupe leader)\n*[[Machiko Ky\u014d]] - Sumiko (his mistress)\n*[[Hiroshi Kawaguchi (actor)|Hiroshi Kawaguchi]] - Kiyoshi (his son)\n*[[Haruko Sugimura]] - Oyoshi (Kiyoshi's mother)\n*[[Ayako Wakao]] - Kayo (younger actress)\n*[[Hitomi Nozoe]] - Aiko\n*[[Chish\u016b Ry\u016b]] - Theatre owner\n*[[K\u014dji Mitsui]] - Kichinosuke\n*[[Haruo Tanaka]] - Yatazo\n*[[Yosuke Irie]] - Sugiyama\n*[[Hikaru Hoshi]] - Kimura\n*[[Mantar\u014d Ushio]] - Sentaro\n*[[Kumeko Urabe]] - Shige\n*[[Tatsuo Hanabu]] - Rokuzaburo\n*[[Tadashi Date]] - Sensh\u014d \n*[[Masahiko Shimazu]] - Masao (Sensh\u014d's grandson)\n*[[Toyoko Takahashi]] - Aiko no haha\n*[[Mutsuko Sakura]] - O-Katsu\n*[[Natsuko Kahara]] - Yae\n*[[Ts\u00fbsai Sugawara]] - Buyer at bankruptcy\n\n==Production==\n\n''Floating Weeds'', Ozu's only film for [[Daiei Film|Daiei]], was produced at the studio's urging after he completed ''[[Good Morning (1959 film)|Good Morning]]'', which had fulfilled the director's contractual obligation to complete one film per year for [[Shochiku]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Donald|last=Richie|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/320-stories-of-floating-weeds|title=Stories of ''Floating Weeds''|publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]|date=April 19, 2004|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref> Ozu first planned to remake ''[[A Story of Floating Weeds]]'' for Shochiku, and the title was intended to be ''A Ham Actor'' ({{lang|ja|\u5927\u6839\u5f79\u8005}} ''{{transl|ja|daikon yakusha}}'', \"radish actor\"); the stars (most of whom were attached to Shochiku) were to include [[Eitar\u014d Shind\u014d]] and [[Chikage Awashima]] as the primary leads, [[Masami Taura]] and [[Ineko Arima]] as the youth leads, and [[Isuzu Yamada]] as the former mistress.
