It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012. Apple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive and idiosyncratic sound, lyrically exploring freedom from oppression and Apple's relationships with women.\n\nThe album was released during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic]], and many critics found its exploration of confinement pertinent. It received universal critical acclaim, and became the highest rated album of all time on review aggregator [[Metacritic]]. On the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' debuted at number four with 44,000 [[equivalent album units]], making it Apple's third top 10 album in the US. \n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, after releasing ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'', Apple began conceptualizing a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's Venice Beach home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\n[[File:SonicRanchOrchard.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Early sessions for the album took place at [[Sonic Ranch]] in Texas.]]\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound. The sessions at Apple's home were largely recorded with [[GarageBand]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> On the long, unedited takes, Apple commented: \"I didn't even know how to edit it and make a take shorter, so each track is just this one long take, and if I made a mistake in it, well, I better just play over it and let that mistake work itself into it\". This resulted in what Apple described as \"percussion orchestras\", especially on \"Newspaper\" and the title track.<ref name=\"NPR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/04/22/841401198/fetch-your-tool-of-liberation-fiona-apple-on-setting-herself-free|title='Fetch Your Tool Of Liberation': Fiona Apple On Setting Herself Free|last=Chang|first=Alisa|date=April 22, 2020|publisher=[[NPR]]|access-date=April 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\nApple likened her house to \"the womb of where I've developed into an adult\", so she chose to record the album at home to \"repay\" the house. She elaborated on the house's presence in the album: \"I really felt like it's an instrument in itself, it's the microphone: The house is the microphone, the house is the ambiance, the house is a member of the band\".<ref name=\"NPR\"/> As well as Apple's home, recording sessions took place at Stanley Recordings and at engineer [[Dave Way]]'s private studio, Waystation.<ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=[[NME]]|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe album's sound is defined by percussion.

The unpredictable songs feature looped sections, sudden stops and tempo changes.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"LA Times\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\".<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> It has been noted as less melancholy than Apple's past work, with the uptempo songs being described as \"funny, angry, and at times triumphant\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> The album features frequent improvisation, as well as background noise such as the barking of dogs, largely as a result of its home recording.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nOn the album, Apple approached her voice as a musical instrument, commenting: \"I have fun with my voice, but I\u2019m not trying to make it pretty all the time. I\u2019m not trying to convince anybody I\u2019m a singer. It just turned out to be another instrument\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> Breihan noted that Apple demonstrates \"a [[rapper]]\u2019s sense that words can be music\",<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> while ''[[The Guardian]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Laura Barton]] highlighted the intimacy of Apple's vocals: \"half-conversational, half-self-mutters, allowing every scuff, breath and feral yelp\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found that \"whether she\u2019s cooing with sarcastic solicitousness or rasping close to a scream, she articulates every word clearly, emoting but never losing control\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/>\n\nLyrically, Apple identified the album's main theme as \"not being afraid to speak,\"<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> with Barton similarly recognising \"a refusal to be silenced\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Apple later said that this was an oversimplification, elaborating that \"it's about breaking out of whatever prison you\u2019ve allowed yourself to live in,\" and pinpointing the message as: \"Fetch the fucking bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation you\u2019re in\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> She has said that writing the album helped free her of the ideas she had of herself, explaining that \"this whole album, for me, has turned into the headache that I had inside of my head and now that it's released, it's like this pulse that now we can all share\".<ref name=\"NPR\"/> Pareles found that the album explored \"both past and present injuries: bullying, sexual assault, destructive mind games, romantic debacles, [Apple's] own fears and compulsions and the people who have taken advantage of them\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> The album explores freedom,<ref name=\"Observer\"/> with Breihan writing that \"we can hear the euphoria of a great unburdening\".<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> The album has also been identified as Apple's most humorous album.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nAnother theme Apple explores on the album are her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple commented that these relationships began to suffer in middle school,<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> and the album features Apple trying to make peace with \"the sorts of women that society has always deemed her 'competition'\", such as subsequent girlfriends of her exes.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> Apple summarised this idea as \"not letting men pit us against each other or keep us separate from each other so they can control the message\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\n==Songs==\nThe opening track, \"I Want You to Love Me\", was initially addressed to a hypothetical lover, but was eventually influenced by Apple's relationship with writer [[Jonathan Ames]], as well as by a period of meditation in 2010\u201311, at [[Spirit Rock Meditation Center]], [[Woodacre, California]]. The latter experience is explored in the line \"And I know when I go all my particles disband and disperse / and I\u2019ll be back in the pulse,\" which explores a breakthrough she achieved following a throbbing headache, \"in which the world lit up, showing her a pulsing space between the people at the retreat\u2014a suggestion of something larger\".<ref name=\"VultureSongs\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-songs.html|title=The Story Behind Every Track on ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters''|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 26, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> \"Shameika\" is named after a girl who attended middle school with Apple.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> The song is based on an experience Apple recalled when she was rejected by a group of popular girls, after which \"Shameika came up, and she was like, 'Why are you trying to sit with those girls? You have potential.'\" The line, \"Sebastian said I'm a good man in a storm\", was inspired by an incident in [[Marfa, Texas]] where the band were almost arrested for cannabis possession. Bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] made the comment to Apple in response to how she handled the event.<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/>\n\n[[File:Cara Delevingne September 2014.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Cara Delevigne]] contributes backing vocals to the album's title track.]]\nThe title track was one of the last songs recorded for the album, and came after the album already had its title.<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> English model and actress [[Cara Delevigne]] provides background vocals; Apple chose Delevigne in part because her English accent matched that of [[Gillian Anderson]]'s character in ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]'', from whom the title is quoted. The sound of barking dogs which appears at the end of the song comes from Apple's dog Mercy, Delevigne's Leo and Alfie, and Zelda Hallman's Maddie.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> The track quotes [[Kate Bush]]'s 1985 single \"[[Running Up That Hill]]\".<ref name=\"Observer\"/> The humorous \"Under the Table\" describes an antagonistic dinner party.<ref name=\"Observer\"/> Apple has said that it was informed by an expensive dinner she attended with \"lots of bragging about things I wouldn\u2019t brag about\". She continued that following an offensive comment made by one of the guests, \"I called the guy out. And may have messed the dinner up a little bit. But I was right\".<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> She later added that one of the guests at the dinner was \"a prominent figure of a streaming service\".<ref name=\"NPR\"/> \"Relay\" features the line, \"Evil is a relay sport, when the one you burn turns to pass the torch\", which Apple first wrote when she was aged 15. Apple explores her own resentments, some of which she has characterised as \"funny\" or \"petty\", including [[social media influencer]]s in the line \"I resent you presenting your life like a fucking propaganda brochure\".<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> The track is musically influenced by both cheerleading chants and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]].<ref name=\"Observer\"/>\n\nApple wrote \"Rack of His\" over a ten-year period; it was inspired by two different relationships she was in. The title was inspired by band-member [[Dav\u00edd Garza]] saying: \"Oh, I did terrible things to that rack of his\".<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> \"Newspaper\" was also inspired by two different relationships.<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> According to [[Maura Johnston]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', the song \"shines a harsh spotlight on the way women are casually and cruelly pitted against each other in the game of love\".<ref name=\"Boston Globe\"/> For ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Jon Pareles]] wrote that the song's narrator \"identifies with her ex\u2019s new girlfriend as she sees \u2014 and now recognizes \u2014 the way he undercuts her\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> The song features backing vocals from Apple's sister, [[cabaret]] singer [[Maude Maggart]], who recorded her vocals while breast feeding. Apple has said that the track's title is arbitrary, and she could not recall its origin.<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> \"Ladies\" also explores the idea of \"not letting men pit [women] against each other\", exploring the relationships between different ex-lovers of the same man. On the track, Apple repeats the word \"ladies\" in various different styles. She commented: \"I like the word ladies, and then it just got to be really fun to say it in different ways...Like, 'Ladies, we better get into it,' and like, 'Ladies are so nice.'\" The line \"I'm a fruit bat\" refers to the use of the word \"bats\" to mean mad, with Apple using the term \"fruit bat\" as an affectionate way of referring to herself.<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/>\n\n\"Heavy Balloon\" explores depression,<ref name=\"Boston Globe\"/> and \"the way that depressed people can start to treat their depression like a friend or a plaything\".<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> Apple commented: \"It\u2019s almost like you get [[Stockholm syndrome]] with your own depression\u2014like you\u2019re kidnapped by your own depression\". The second verse, including the line \"The bottom begins to feel like the only safe place that you know\", was partially inspired by an episode of television series ''[[The Affair (TV series)|The Affair]]''.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> The line \"I spread like strawberries, I climb like peas and beans\" was inspired by a children's gardening book, referencing the fact that strawberry plants tend to spread horizontally through soil and [[legumes]] can grow vertically.<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> [[Wesley Morris]] of ''The New York Times'' found the track musically reminscient of Apple's debut album ''[[Tidal (album)|Tidal]]'' (1996), while [[Jon Caramanica]] of the same publication found that this applied to \"Cosmonauts\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> The latter track was originally recorded with long-time collaborator [[Jon Brion]] for the 2012 [[comedy film]] ''[[This Is 40]]'', for which Brion composed the score. The track was not used in the film, with Apple's \"[[Dull Tool|Dull Tool]]\" appearing instead. Brion wanted the track to explore the idea of a life-long romantic relationship, which challenged Apple, who did not \"know if [she] want[ed] to be together with anybody forever\". Because of this, Apple said: \"I interpreted it as like, 'It\u2019s going to be you and me in this little vessel by ourselves in space, except it\u2019s going to weigh a lot more, and you\u2019re going to really get on my nerves.' It\u2019s supposed to be a song about being together forever, and so of course my first line is, 'Your face ignites a fuse to my patience.' Like whatever you do, it\u2019s going to be wrong\".<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/>\n\nApple is the only musician credited on \"For Her\",<ref name=\"Credits\"/> which has been described as \"cathartic\",<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> and \"one of the album's most arresting songs\".<ref name=\"Boston Globe\"/> The track's depiction of a man's abuse of a woman is based, with permission, on the stories told to Apple by a friend who worked as an intern at a film production company. The song addresses the man on behalf of the friend, in Apple's words, \"to, in a roundabout way, tell her story that she\u2019s not able to tell\". She also commented: \"And of course it brings up stuff of my own. It started out me wanting to write something about my own feelings, but it was just too hard. I wanted to make it about not just me but about other people\".<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> The song, especially the lines \"Good mornin'! Good mornin'\u00a0/\u00a0You raped me in the same bed your daughter was born in\", was partly written in response to the nomination of [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]] [[Brett Kavanaugh]], despite multiple allegations of sexual violence.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Musically, the track has three sections. It begins as \"a kind of playground chant\", and then a \"rebuking tribal cheer\",<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> before \"it shape-shifts into a fever dream, the backing vocals eventually settling into an abstracted wail\".<ref name=\"Boston Globe\"/>\n\n\"Drumset\" was written in the period following Apple's break-up with Ames. Apple had a minor argument with her band, after which drummer Amy Aileen Wood removed her drumset for a live performance. Apple said she mis-interpreted this \"as that they were pissed at me and that they weren\u2019t going to come back\", at which point she improvised the lyrics to the song: \"The drumset is gone, and the rug it was on is still here, screaming at me\". The band later recorded the song in a single take.<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple has called closing track \"On I Go\" a \"[[vipassan\u0101]] chant\" which she originally sung while imprisoned following a 2012 arrest for hash possession. She has said that the song explores how \"there doesn\u2019t have to be any specific meaning or reward or consequence of the things I\u2019m doing\".<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> Caramanica highlighted a \"fascinating, circular pattern in the vocal rhythms; incisive and destabilizing percussion; plenty of empty space that leaves room for shock\", comparing the effect to the lyrical experimentation of [[independent hip hop]] in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Gillian Anderson (9347352920).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The album's title is quoted from [[Gillian Anderson]]'s character in ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]''.]]\n\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At the start of April, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fiona-apple-releasing-new-album-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-this-month/|title=Fiona Apple Releasing New Album ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' This Month|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=April 1, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref> [[Epic Records]] had planned to release the album in October, due to promotional limitations brought by the [[impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on the arts and cultural heritage|coronavirus pandemic]].

Apple sent him a photo she had taken of herself \"two or three\" years earlier, and saved as a potential cover photo. On the choice of photograph, she commented: \"That face is very much me. I just wanted to be like, 'Hey, guess what? I\u2019m back! Here are some songs. Want to listen to the music, huh? Hi, hi, hi, hi.'\"<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nThe title, ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'', is a quote from the British-Irish crime drama television series ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]'', where the protagonist, a sex-crimes investigator portrayed by [[Gillian Anderson]], recites the phrase while investigating a crime scene where a woman was tortured.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> The quote reflects the album's exploration of becoming free, with Apple summarising the title's message as \"Fetch your tool of liberation.

It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012. Apple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive and idiosyncratic sound, lyrically exploring freedom from oppression and Apple's relationships with women.\n\nThe album was released during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic]], and many critics found its exploration of confinement pertinent. It received universal critical acclaim, and became the highest rated album of all time on review aggregator [[Metacritic]]. On the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' debuted at number four with 44,000 [[equivalent album units]], making it Apple's third top 10 album in the US. \n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, after releasing ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'', Apple began conceptualizing a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's Venice Beach home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\n[[File:SonicRanchOrchard.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Early sessions for the album took place at [[Sonic Ranch]] in Texas.]]\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound. The sessions at Apple's home were largely recorded with [[GarageBand]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> On the long, unedited takes, Apple commented: \"I didn't even know how to edit it and make a take shorter, so each track is just this one long take, and if I made a mistake in it, well, I better just play over it and let that mistake work itself into it\". This resulted in what Apple described as \"percussion orchestras\", especially on \"Newspaper\" and the title track.<ref name=\"NPR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/04/22/841401198/fetch-your-tool-of-liberation-fiona-apple-on-setting-herself-free|title='Fetch Your Tool Of Liberation': Fiona Apple On Setting Herself Free|last=Chang|first=Alisa|date=April 22, 2020|publisher=[[NPR]]|access-date=April 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\nApple likened her house to \"the womb of where I've developed into an adult\", so she chose to record the album at home to \"repay\" the house. She elaborated on the house's presence in the album: \"I really felt like it's an instrument in itself, it's the microphone: The house is the microphone, the house is the ambiance, the house is a member of the band\".<ref name=\"NPR\"/> As well as Apple's home, recording sessions took place at Stanley Recordings and at engineer [[Dave Way]]'s private studio, Waystation.<ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020.

The unpredictable songs feature looped sections, sudden stops and tempo changes.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"LA Times\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\".<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> It has been noted as less melancholy than Apple's past work, with the uptempo songs being described as \"funny, angry, and at times triumphant\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> The album features frequent improvisation, as well as background noise such as the barking of dogs, largely as a result of its home recording.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nOn the album, Apple approached her voice as a musical instrument, commenting: \"I have fun with my voice, but I\u2019m not trying to make it pretty all the time. I\u2019m not trying to convince anybody I\u2019m a singer. It just turned out to be another instrument\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> Breihan noted that Apple demonstrates \"a [[rapper]]\u2019s sense that words can be music\",<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> while ''[[The Guardian]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Laura Barton]] highlighted the intimacy of Apple's vocals: \"half-conversational, half-self-mutters, allowing every scuff, breath and feral yelp\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found that \"whether she\u2019s cooing with sarcastic solicitousness or rasping close to a scream, she articulates every word clearly, emoting but never losing control\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/>\n\nLyrically, Apple identified the album's main theme as \"not being afraid to speak,\"<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> with Barton similarly recognising \"a refusal to be silenced\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Apple later said that this was an oversimplification, elaborating that \"it's about breaking out of whatever prison you\u2019ve allowed yourself to live in,\" and pinpointing the message as: \"Fetch the fucking bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation you\u2019re in\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> She has said that writing the album helped free her of the ideas she had of herself, explaining that \"this whole album, for me, has turned into the headache that I had inside of my head and now that it's released, it's like this pulse that now we can all share\".<ref name=\"NPR\"/> Pareles found that the album explored \"both past and present injuries: bullying, sexual assault, destructive mind games, romantic debacles, [Apple's] own fears and compulsions and the people who have taken advantage of them\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> The album explores freedom,<ref name=\"Observer\"/> with Breihan writing that \"we can hear the euphoria of a great unburdening\".<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> The album has also been identified as Apple's most humorous album.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nAnother theme Apple explores on the album are her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple commented that these relationships began to suffer in middle school,<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> and the album features Apple trying to make peace with \"the sorts of women that society has always deemed her 'competition'\", such as subsequent girlfriends of her exes.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> Apple summarised this idea as \"not letting men pit us against each other or keep us separate from each other so they can control the message\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\n==Songs==\nThe opening track, \"I Want You to Love Me\", was initially addressed to a hypothetical lover, but was eventually influenced by Apple's relationship with writer [[Jonathan Ames]], as well as by a period of meditation in 2010\u201311, at [[Spirit Rock Meditation Center]], [[Woodacre, California]]. The latter experience is explored in the line \"And I know when I go all my particles disband and disperse / and I\u2019ll be back in the pulse,\" which explores a breakthrough she achieved following a throbbing headache, \"in which the world lit up, showing her a pulsing space between the people at the retreat\u2014a suggestion of something larger\".<ref name=\"VultureSongs\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-songs.html|title=The Story Behind Every Track on ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters''|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 26, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> \"Shameika\" is named after a girl who attended middle school with Apple.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> The song is based on an experience Apple recalled when she was rejected by a group of popular girls, after which \"Shameika came up, and she was like, 'Why are you trying to sit with those girls? You have potential.'\" The line, \"Sebastian said I'm a good man in a storm\", was inspired by an incident in [[Marfa, Texas]] where the band were almost arrested for cannabis possession. Bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] made the comment to Apple in response to how she handled the event.<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/>\n\n[[File:Cara Delevingne September 2014.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Cara Delevigne]] contributes backing vocals to the album's title track.]]\nThe title track was one of the last songs recorded for the album, and came after the album already had its title.<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> English model and actress [[Cara Delevigne]] provides background vocals; Apple chose Delevigne in part because her English accent matched that of [[Gillian Anderson]]'s character in ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]'', from whom the title is quoted. The sound of barking dogs which appears at the end of the song comes from Apple's dog Mercy, Delevigne's Leo and Alfie, and Zelda Hallman's Maddie.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> The track quotes [[Kate Bush]]'s 1985 single \"[[Running Up That Hill]]\".<ref name=\"Observer\"/> The humorous \"Under the Table\" describes an antagonistic dinner party.<ref name=\"Observer\"/> Apple has said that it was informed by an expensive dinner she attended with \"lots of bragging about things I wouldn\u2019t brag about\". She continued that following an offensive comment made by one of the guests, \"I called the guy out. And may have messed the dinner up a little bit. But I was right\".<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> She later added that one of the guests at the dinner was \"a prominent figure of a streaming service\".<ref name=\"NPR\"/> \"Relay\" features the line, \"Evil is a relay sport, when the one you burn turns to pass the torch\", which Apple first wrote when she was aged 15. Apple explores her own resentments, some of which she has characterised as \"funny\" or \"petty\", including [[social media influencer]]s in the line \"I resent you presenting your life like a fucking propaganda brochure\".<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> The track is musically influenced by both cheerleading chants and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]].<ref name=\"Observer\"/>\n\nApple wrote \"Rack of His\" over a ten-year period; it was inspired by two different relationships she was in. The title was inspired by band-member [[Dav\u00edd Garza]] saying: \"Oh, I did terrible things to that rack of his\".<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> \"Newspaper\" was also inspired by two different relationships.<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> According to [[Maura Johnston]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', the song \"shines a harsh spotlight on the way women are casually and cruelly pitted against each other in the game of love\".<ref name=\"Boston Globe\"/> For ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Jon Pareles]] wrote that the song's narrator \"identifies with her ex\u2019s new girlfriend as she sees \u2014 and now recognizes \u2014 the way he undercuts her\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> The song features backing vocals from Apple's sister, [[cabaret]] singer [[Maude Maggart]], who recorded her vocals while breast feeding. Apple has said that the track's title is arbitrary, and she could not recall its origin.<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> \"Ladies\" also explores the idea of \"not letting men pit [women] against each other\", exploring the relationships between different ex-lovers of the same man. On the track, Apple repeats the word \"ladies\" in various different styles. She commented: \"I like the word ladies, and then it just got to be really fun to say it in different ways...Like, 'Ladies, we better get into it,' and like, 'Ladies are so nice.'\" The line \"I'm a fruit bat\" refers to the use of the word \"bats\" to mean mad, with Apple using the term \"fruit bat\" as an affectionate way of referring to herself.<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/>\n\n\"Heavy Balloon\" explores depression,<ref name=\"Boston Globe\"/> and \"the way that depressed people can start to treat their depression like a friend or a plaything\".<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> Apple commented: \"It\u2019s almost like you get [[Stockholm syndrome]] with your own depression\u2014like you\u2019re kidnapped by your own depression\". The second verse, including the line \"The bottom begins to feel like the only safe place that you know\", was partially inspired by an episode of television series ''[[The Affair (TV series)|The Affair]]''.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> The line \"I spread like strawberries, I climb like peas and beans\" was inspired by a children's gardening book, referencing the fact that strawberry plants tend to spread horizontally through soil and [[legumes]] can grow vertically.<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> [[Wesley Morris]] of ''The New York Times'' found the track musically reminscient of Apple's debut album ''[[Tidal (album)|Tidal]]'' (1996), while [[Jon Caramanica]] of the same publication found that this applied to \"Cosmonauts\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> The latter track was originally recorded with long-time collaborator [[Jon Brion]] for the 2012 [[comedy film]] ''[[This Is 40]]'', for which Brion composed the score. The track was not used in the film, with Apple's \"[[Dull Tool|Dull Tool]]\" appearing instead. Brion wanted the track to explore the idea of a life-long romantic relationship, which challenged Apple, who did not \"know if [she] want[ed] to be together with anybody forever\". Because of this, Apple said: \"I interpreted it as like, 'It\u2019s going to be you and me in this little vessel by ourselves in space, except it\u2019s going to weigh a lot more, and you\u2019re going to really get on my nerves.' It\u2019s supposed to be a song about being together forever, and so of course my first line is, 'Your face ignites a fuse to my patience.' Like whatever you do, it\u2019s going to be wrong\".<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/>\n\nApple is the only musician credited on \"For Her\",<ref name=\"Credits\"/> which has been described as \"cathartic\",<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> and \"one of the album's most arresting songs\".<ref name=\"Boston Globe\"/> The track's depiction of a man's abuse of a woman is based, with permission, on the stories told to Apple by a friend who worked as an intern at a film production company. The song addresses the man on behalf of the friend, in Apple's words, \"to, in a roundabout way, tell her story that she\u2019s not able to tell\". She also commented: \"And of course it brings up stuff of my own. It started out me wanting to write something about my own feelings, but it was just too hard. I wanted to make it about not just me but about other people\".<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> The song, especially the lines \"Good mornin'! Good mornin'\u00a0/\u00a0You raped me in the same bed your daughter was born in\", was partly written in response to the nomination of [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]] [[Brett Kavanaugh]], despite multiple allegations of sexual violence.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Musically, the track has three sections. It begins as \"a kind of playground chant\", and then a \"rebuking tribal cheer\",<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> before \"it shape-shifts into a fever dream, the backing vocals eventually settling into an abstracted wail\".<ref name=\"Boston Globe\"/>\n\n\"Drumset\" was written in the period following Apple's break-up with Ames. Apple had a minor argument with her band, after which drummer Amy Aileen Wood removed her drumset for a live performance. Apple said she mis-interpreted this \"as that they were pissed at me and that they weren\u2019t going to come back\", at which point she improvised the lyrics to the song: \"The drumset is gone, and the rug it was on is still here, screaming at me\". The band later recorded the song in a single take.<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple has called closing track \"On I Go\" a \"[[vipassan\u0101]] chant\" which she originally sung while imprisoned following a 2012 arrest for hash possession. She has said that the song explores how \"there doesn\u2019t have to be any specific meaning or reward or consequence of the things I\u2019m doing\".<ref name=\"VultureSongs\"/> Caramanica highlighted a \"fascinating, circular pattern in the vocal rhythms; incisive and destabilizing percussion; plenty of empty space that leaves room for shock\", comparing the effect to the lyrical experimentation of [[independent hip hop]] in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Gillian Anderson (9347352920).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The album's title is quoted from [[Gillian Anderson]]'s character in ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]''.]]\n\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At the start of April, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fiona-apple-releasing-new-album-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-this-month/|title=Fiona Apple Releasing New Album ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' This Month|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=April 1, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref> [[Epic Records]] had planned to release the album in October, due to promotional limitations brought by the [[impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on the arts and cultural heritage|coronavirus pandemic]].

Apple sent him a photo she had taken of herself \"two or three\" years earlier, and saved as a potential cover photo. On the choice of photograph, she commented: \"That face is very much me. I just wanted to be like, 'Hey, guess what? I\u2019m back! Here are some songs. Want to listen to the music, huh? Hi, hi, hi, hi.'\"<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nThe title, ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'', is a quote from the British-Irish crime drama television series ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]'', where the protagonist, a sex-crimes investigator portrayed by [[Gillian Anderson]], recites the phrase while investigating a crime scene where a woman was tortured.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> The quote reflects the album's exploration of becoming free, with Apple summarising the title's message as \"Fetch your tool of liberation.
