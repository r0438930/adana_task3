{"title_page": "Exclusive mandate", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=January 2017}}\n\nAn '''exclusive mandate''' is a government's assertion of its legitimate authority over a certain territory, part of which another government controls with stable, ''[[de facto]]'' [[sovereignty]]. It is also known as a claim to sole representation or an exclusive authority claim. The concept was particularly important during the [[Cold War]] period when a number of states were divided on ideological grounds.\n\n== Germany from 1949 to 1990 ==\n{{Further|History of Germany (1945\u20131990)|Cold War}}\n\n=== Federal Republic of Germany ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}{{Further|West Germany}}\n\nFor nearly all of the 41 years that [[Germany]] was split into two countries, the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany)]] claimed to be the sole legitimate successor to the [[German Reich]] that existed from 1871 to 1945. This claim was initially based solely on the government's mandate by virtue of [[Election#Difficulties with elections|free elections]].  To that end, it claimed [[Berlin]], capital of united Germany from 1871 to 1945, as its capital, with the provisional capital in [[Bonn]].\n\nIn a statement made before the [[Bundestag]], German Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] asserted this mandate as early as October 21, 1949, in response to the constitution of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) coming into effect. The Secretary of State Summit of the three western powers on September 18, 1950 in [[New York City]], supported Chancellor Adenauer's claim.\n\nWhen the [[Soviet Union]] proclaimed the sovereignty of the GDR, the West German [[Bundestag]] once again unanimously insisted that the Federal Republic was the sole legitimate representative of the German people. At the [[Treaties of Paris (1954)|Treaties of Paris]] (''[[:de:Pariser Vertr\u00e4ge|Pariser Vertr\u00e4ge]]''), at which the Federal Republic of Germany was admitted into the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], the allied nations adopted the position which the three western allies had already confirmed at the [[Nine-Power Conference]] in [[London]]: that the Federal Republic had the exclusive right to act on behalf of the entire German people in matters of foreign policy. The western nations thereby recognized the Federal Republic as the only lawful government for Germany as a whole.\n\nAside from such considerations pertaining to international law, the [[reunification clause]] of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] suggested that international recognition of the German Democratic Republic was to be avoided, so as not to sever the constitutional mandate to a unified German state.\n\nUntil 1973, the Federal Republic took a strict line in claiming an exclusive mandate for all of Germany.  Under the [[Hallstein Doctrine]], the Federal Republic broke diplomatic relations with states that maintained diplomatic relations with the GDR, except for the Soviet Union. On different levels, such as in international sports, there were, however, a wide range of international cooperations which even led to unified German teams in six Olympic Games.<ref>[[Arnd Kr\u00fcger]]: ''Sport und Politik, Vom Turnvater Jahn zum Staatsamateur.'' Hannover: Fackeltr\u00e4ger 1975. {{ISBN|3-7716-2087-2}}.</ref>  Over time, especially after the election of a social-liberal coalition led by [[Willy Brandt]] in 1969, the exclusive mandate was softened, as it severely limited the Federal Republic's domestic and international autonomy.  Starting in 1973, under the ''[[Ostpolitik]]'' policy, the Federal Republic took the line that the Democratic Republic was a ''[[de facto]]'' government within a single German nation, in respect of which the Federal Republic was the sole representative ''[[de jure]]'', but limited to its own territorial extent; hence relinquishing any claim to be ''de jure'' the government of Germany as a whole.\n\nJudicially, an exclusive mandate had been claimed to have arisen from the proposition that the German state as a whole had been preserved, that only one German state could legitimately exist, and that that one state was identical with the Federal Republic. The German Democratic Republic was therefore held to be an illegally constituted [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[puppet state]] occupying territory that rightfully belonged to the Federal Republic, thus lacking autonomy. An alternate view held that the GDR was in a state of [[civil war]] with the FRG government, and therefore could not be recognized as a state under [[international law]]. A third, the so-called \"umbrella state\" theory, entails the existence of two fragment states under the umbrella of a single German nation that had been formed in 1871 and which had never actually been annihilated; this theory arose in the late 1960s and was maintained in a ruling of the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] of 31 July 1973 upholding the \"[[Basic Treaty (1972)|Basic Treaty]]\" by which relations between East and West Germany were normalised.  Crucially, although the Constitutional Court reaffirmed the proposition that the pre-1945 German state had been preserved and organised, albeit partially, in the institutions of the Federal Republic, the Justices explicitly rejected the proposition that this would imply an exclusive mandate; \"...identity does not require exclusivity\".\n\nWith the admission of both German states to the [[United Nations]] in 1973, matters regarding the exclusive mandate were no longer relevant. Nevertheless, the Constitutional Court maintained that the Federal Republic continued to bear a responsibility for the whole German people; albeit that this responsibility could only be discharged in respect of Germans physically present in its territory or within its jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Federal Republic of Germany did not recognize a distinct citizenship for the German Democratic Republic; if East Germans presented themselves in West Germany, or at a West German embassy in a third country, they could obtain a West German passport.  Generally, the Federal Republic considered East Germans to be German citizens under the old 1871&ndash;1945 all-German citizenship (i.e. ''Bundesb\u00fcrger'', citizens of West Germany). Refugees who fled from the GDR were therefore not deported, and automatically qualified for West German citizenship.\n\nIn addition, visitors from the GDR would receive a West German passport upon request, for example, in order to ease travel to the United States. After the fall of the Berlin wall in November 1989, East Germans were greeted with [[Begr\u00fc\u00dfungsgeld]] (100 West German [[Deutsche Mark]]) and could travel freely within West Germany, while West German access to the East was still hindered for some weeks by visa and the [[Mindestumtausch]] mandatory minimum exchange of 25 DM.\n\n=== German Democratic Republic (1949\u201390) ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}{{Further|East Germany}}\n\nThe 1949 constitution of the German Democratic Republic also acknowledged that Germany was an indivisible republic, and thus there was only one German citizenship. The GDR, therefore, was also founded on the premise of being the ''de jure'' sovereign representative of all Germany.  Initially, it regarded the West German regime as an illegally constituted NATO puppet state, a line accepted by most of the [[Eastern bloc]]. The GDR erected the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961 partly to prevent Germans moving freely within Germany. In 1974, however, the reunification clause was stricken from the GDR's constitution. Thereafter, it regarded itself as a separate state from West Germany.  The Communist regime collapsed in the fall of 1989.  East Germany lingered on for another year until it declared its accession to the Federal Republic in the [[German reunification]] of 1990.\n\n==Ireland ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}{{Further|Irish revolutionary period|The Troubles}}\n\nThe 1919-1921 [[Irish Republic]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] from 1938-1999 both claimed the entire [[island of Ireland]], including [[Northern Ireland]] which is part of the UK. [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Article 2]] of the [[Irish Constitution]] stated, \"The national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas.\" In 1999, following the  [[Good Friday Agreement]], Ireland passed the  [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Nineteenth Amendment]] which deleted Article 2.\n\n== Mainland China and Taiwan ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2020}}\n{{Further|Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|One-China policy|1992 Consensus|Political status of Taiwan}}\n[[File:ROC Administrative and Claims.svg|300px|thumb|right|Map showing the ''de jure'' territorial claims of the ROC and the PRC.]]\n\nThe [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) was established in [[mainland China]] in 1912 following the conclusion of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] which led to the collapse of the [[Qing dynasty]].

The ROC's sovereignty claim over areas under the control of the PRC is also not actively pursued under the pro-independence [[Democratic Progressive Party]]-led government.\n\n==Korea==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}{{Further|Division of Korea|Korean conflict}}\n\nWhen [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] were created within months of each other in 1948, both claimed sovereignty over the entire Korean peninsula.  Both states claimed that the other was an unlawfully constituted puppet state of the United States and the Soviet Union, respectively.  In 1991, however, both nations joined the UN, as part of their reconciliation policy.\n\n==Vietnam==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}{{Further|1954 Geneva Conference|Vietnam War}}\n\nThe [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] was proclaimed in 1945; the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]] gained its independence from [[France]] in 1954. While elections were intended to be held in 1955 to reunite the country, they never took place.  For the next 20 years, both staked claims to all of Vietnam, claiming that the other was an illegally constituted puppet state.  This continued until South Vietnam [[unconditional surrender|unconditionally surrendered]] to  North Vietnam in 1975.\n\nWhen some European countries (such as [[Switzerland]]) started recognizing North Vietnam towards the end of the Vietnam war, South Vietnam did not interrupt its diplomatic relations with them. Switzerland thus recognized North Vietnam in 1971 but also turned its consulate in [[Saigon]] (South Vietnam) into an embassy until the end of the war in 1975.\n\nIn 1979, Vietnam [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War|invaded and occupied]] [[Cambodia]] (at that time was ruled by the [[Khmer Rouge]] as [[Democratic Kampuchea]]) establishing the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]], but it was dismissed by the [[China|People's Republic of China]] as a \"puppet state\". At the time, both of the countries had disputed the claims of being the sole legitimate representative of all the [[Khmer people]] of Cambodia in the [[United Nations]]. This resulted in its seat being retained by the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]], a coalition government formed in 1982 as a [[government in exile]] and composed of the royalist [[FUNCINPEC]] party, the republican [[Khmer People's National Liberation Front]] and the Khmer Rouge-backed [[Party of Democratic Kampuchea]].\n\n==Syria==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Syrian Civil War}}\n\nA similar situation occurred at the start of the [[Syrian Civil War]] in March 2011 when two governments claimed sovereignty over the whole Syria: The [[Government of Syria|Syrian government]] headed by [[Bashar al-Assad]] and the [[Syrian opposition|various opposition groups]] seeking to remove Assad consisting of the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces]], [[Syrian National Council]] and the [[Syrian Interim Government]]. Both entities are considered puppet entities backed by the [[Russia|Russian Federation]]/[[Iran]] and the [[United States]]/[[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nIn addition, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIS/ISIL), a [[Sunni Islam]]ist fundamentalist militant group, controlled part of the Syrian territory along with portions of neighbouring [[Iraq]].\n\nIn a more ambiguous situation, the Kurdish territory of northeast Syria became controlled by Syrian Kurdish federal state [[Rojava]] when Syrian government forces left the area, or areas were liberated from ISIL occupation.\n\n==Israeli and Palestinian territories==\n{{main|United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict}}\n{{Expand section|date=December 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hallstein Doctrine]]\n* [[List of states with limited recognition]]\n* [[List of historical unrecognized countries]]\n* [[Post-Soviet conflicts]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cross-Strait relations}}\n{{Germany topics}}\n{{Korea topics}}\n{{Vietnam topics}}\n{{Syrian Civil War}}\n{{Arab\u2013Israeli conflict}}\n{{Cold War}}\n\n[[Category:Cold War]]\n[[Category:Government]]\n[[Category:Political geography]]\n[[Category:Political history of Germany]]\n[[Category:Politics of East Germany]]\n[[Category:Sovereignty]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=January 2017}}\n\nAn '''exclusive mandate''' is a government's assertion of its legitimate authority over a certain territory, part of which another government controls with stable, ''[[de facto]]'' [[sovereignty]].

The UN formally designates ROC-held territories as \"[[Taiwan, China|Taiwan, Province of China]]\".\n\nThe ROC currently participates in numerous international events and organizations under the name \"[[Chinese Taipei]]\" while the [[World Trade Organization]] officially refers to ROC-controlled territories as the \"Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu\".\n\nThe exclusive mandate claim of the ROC has softened with the rise of [[Taiwanese nationalism]] and [[Taiwan independence movement]]. The ROC's sovereignty claim over areas under the control of the PRC is also not actively pursued under the pro-independence [[Democratic Progressive Party]]-led government.\n\n==Korea==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}{{Further|Division of Korea|Korean conflict}}\n\nWhen [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] were created within months of each other in 1948, both claimed sovereignty over the entire Korean peninsula.  Both states claimed that the other was an unlawfully constituted puppet state of the United States and the Soviet Union, respectively.  In 1991, however, both nations joined the UN, as part of their reconciliation policy.\n\n==Vietnam==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}{{Further|1954 Geneva Conference|Vietnam War}}\n\nThe [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] was proclaimed in 1945; the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]] gained its independence from [[France]] in 1954. While elections were intended to be held in 1955 to reunite the country, they never took place.  For the next 20 years, both staked claims to all of Vietnam, claiming that the other was an illegally constituted puppet state.  This continued until South Vietnam [[unconditional surrender|unconditionally surrendered]] to  North Vietnam in 1975.\n\nWhen some European countries (such as [[Switzerland]]) started recognizing North Vietnam towards the end of the Vietnam war, South Vietnam did not interrupt its diplomatic relations with them. Switzerland thus recognized North Vietnam in 1971 but also turned its consulate in [[Saigon]] (South Vietnam) into an embassy until the end of the war in 1975.\n\nIn 1979, Vietnam [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War|invaded and occupied]] [[Cambodia]] (at that time was ruled by the [[Khmer Rouge]] as [[Democratic Kampuchea]]) establishing the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]], but it was dismissed by the [[China|People's Republic of China]] as a \"puppet state\". At the time, both of the countries had disputed the claims of being the sole legitimate representative of all the [[Khmer people]] of Cambodia in the [[United Nations]]. This resulted in its seat being retained by the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]], a coalition government formed in 1982 as a [[government in exile]] and composed of the royalist [[FUNCINPEC]] party, the republican [[Khmer People's National Liberation Front]] and the Khmer Rouge-backed [[Party of Democratic Kampuchea]].\n\n==Syria==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Syrian Civil War}}\n\nA similar situation occurred at the start of the [[Syrian Civil War]] in March 2011 when two governments claimed sovereignty over the whole Syria: The [[Government of Syria|Syrian government]] headed by [[Bashar al-Assad]] and the [[Syrian opposition|various opposition groups]] seeking to remove Assad consisting of the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces]], [[Syrian National Council]] and the [[Syrian Interim Government]]. Both entities are considered puppet entities backed by the [[Russia|Russian Federation]]/[[Iran]] and the [[United States]]/[[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nIn addition, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIS/ISIL), a [[Sunni Islam]]ist fundamentalist militant group, controlled part of the Syrian territory along with portions of neighbouring [[Iraq]].\n\nIn a more ambiguous situation, the Kurdish territory of northeast Syria became controlled by Syrian Kurdish federal state [[Rojava]] when Syrian government forces left the area, or areas were liberated from ISIL occupation.\n\n==Israeli and Palestinian territories==\n{{main|United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict}}\n{{Expand section|date=December 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hallstein Doctrine]]\n* [[List of states with limited recognition]]\n* [[List of historical unrecognized countries]]\n* [[Post-Soviet conflicts]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cross-Strait relations}}\n{{Germany topics}}\n{{Korea topics}}\n{{Vietnam topics}}\n{{Syrian Civil War}}\n{{Arab\u2013Israeli conflict}}\n{{Cold War}}\n\n[[Category:Cold War]]\n[[Category:Government]]\n[[Category:Political geography]]\n[[Category:Political history of Germany]]\n[[Category:Politics of East Germany]]\n[[Category:Sovereignty]]\n", "name_user": "Morrisonjohn022", "label": "safe", "comment": "minor fix to date", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_mandate"}
