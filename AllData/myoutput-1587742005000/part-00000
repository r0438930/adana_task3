It last aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on June 20, 1963. It was the 39th episode in the show's sixth and final season, and the 234th episode in the complete series.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe episode begins with June finding an old family scrapbook while housecleaning. She gathers the family together in the living room to glance through the book. Brief highlights from the series are replayed as the Cleavers reminisce over old photographs (which are stills from earlier episodes, with no acknowledgement of, nor explanation offered, for how the photos would have been taken secretly, as in ''[[The Truman Show]]''). [[Ken Osmond]] as [[Eddie Haskell]], [[Rusty Stevens]] as [[Larry Mondello]], [[Madge Blake]] as Mrs. Mondello, Pamela Baird as Mary Ellen Rogers, and [[Sue Randall]] as Miss Landers are seen in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s from several episodes including \"Beaver Gets 'Spelled\", \"New Neighbors\", \"My Brother's Girl\", \"The Shave\", \"Beaver Runs Away\", \"Larry Hides Out\", \"Teacher Comes to Dinner\", and \"Wally's Election\". The episode ends with the teenage Cleaver boys playing with a wind-up toy and laughing like children. It is in the final episode that the viewer learns how Beaver got his nickname.\n\n==Cast and crew==\n\"Family Scrapbook\" stars [[Hugh Beaumont]] and [[Barbara Billingsley]] as archetypal suburban couple, [[Ward Cleaver|Ward]] and [[June Cleaver]]. Along for the ride are [[Tony Dow]] as the couple's older son, [[Wally Cleaver]], and [[Jerry Mathers]] as their younger son, [[Theodore Cleaver|Theodore \"Beaver\" Cleaver]]. All guest stars in the episode appear in clips from previous episodes in the series. The episode was written by the show's creators, Joe Connelly and [[Bob Mosher]], with series star, Hugh Beaumont directing.\n\n==Significance==\n\"Family Scrapbook\" has claimed its place in television history as the first traditional primetime series finale. No other series prior to ''Leave It to Beaver'' had a special final episode except ''[[Howdy Doody]]'' in 1960 (which didn't use flashbacks and was not a primetime sitcom). Most series ended with a general story line episode not unlike any other episode in the series.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/leave-it-to-beaver/family-scrapbook/episode/81230/summary.html Leave It to Beaver: Family Scrapbook - TV.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Nearly twenty years later, in 1983, the cast reunited for a TV movie entitled ''[[Still the Beaver]]'' which spawned the revival series ''The New Leave it to Beaver'' which produced 100 episodes from 1984 until 1989.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Leave It to Beaver episodes]] \n \n==References==\n*Applebaum, Irwyn.
