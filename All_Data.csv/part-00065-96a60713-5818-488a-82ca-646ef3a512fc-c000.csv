'''DH Tauri b''', also known as DH Tau b, is a confirmed, uninhabitable, gas giant [[exoplanet]] in the [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus ]] constellation, orbiting the star, [[DH Tauri]].<ref>[http://www.exoplanetkyoto.org/exohtml/DH_Tau_b.html www.exoplanetkyoto.org/DH_Tau_b]</ref>

==Discovery==
DH Tauri b  was discovered with the [[Subaru Telescope]] at the [[National Astronomical Observatory of Japan]], using the [[Methods of detecting exoplanets|direct imaging]] method, and its discovery was announced in 2005. It was discovered by Yoichi Itoh, Masahiko Hayashi, Motohide Tamura, Takashi Tsuji, Yumiko Oasa, Misato Fukagawa, Saeko S. Hayashi, Takahiro Naoi, Miki Ishi, Satoshi Mayama, Jun-ichi Morino, Takuya Yamashita, Tae-Soo Pyo, Takayuki Nishikawa, Tomonori Usuda, Koji Murakawa, Hiroshi Suto, Shin Oya, Naruhisa Takato, Hiroyasu Ando, Shoken M. Miyama, Naoto Kobayashi, and Norio Kaifu.

==Characteristics==
DH Tauri b has a mass 11 Jupiters, and a radius of 2.7 Jupiters, however, the radius is an approximation. The exoplanet's surface gravity is 4.0_4.5. DH Tauri b has an equilibrium temperature of 2750 [[Kelvin]] (which is 2476.85 [[Celsius]], or 4490.33 [[Fahrenheit]]).<ref>[http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/DH%20Tau_b/ exoplanet.eu/catalog/DHTau_b] The Extrasolar Encyclopedia Planet Encyclopedia</ref><ref>[https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/7016/dh-tauri-b/ exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/dh-tauri-b] Nasa catalog</ref> DH Tauri b's atmosphere contains both [[Carbon monoxide|carbon monoxide]] (CO) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O). Despite having water, the planet is [[Uninhabitable|uninhabitable]], as it lies 320 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] away from its star, outside the [[Habitable zone|habitable zone]], or \"Goldilocks Zone\". DH Tauri b has a projected rotational velocity of around 9.6 km/s. For reference, the Earth has a rotational velocity of 0.46 km/s.<ref>[http://www.openexoplanetcatalogue.com/planet/DH%20Tau%20B/ www.openexoplanetcatalogue.com/planet/DHTauB/] Open exoplanet catalouge</ref><ref>[http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=DH+Tau+&submit=SIMBAD+search simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/DHTau]</ref><ref>[https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01759 arxiv.org/abs] Abstract</ref>

'''Cassidy International Airport''' {{Airport codes|CXI|PLCH}} is an airport located north of [[Banana, Kiribati|Banana]], a settlement on [[Kiritimati]] (also known as Christmas Island) in [[Kiribati]]. It is the only airport in the Kiribati part of the [[Line Islands]] with an [[IATA airport code|IATA]] or [[ICAO airport code|ICAO code]].

The airport is served by [[Fiji Airways]] from [[Nadi]], Fiji and [[Honolulu]], United States. Since neither [[Air Kiribati]] nor [[Coral Sun Airways]] owns aircraft capable of flying between Kiritimati and the [[Gilbert Islands]], where all other operational airports in Kiribati are located, there are no domestic flights to or from Kiritimati. 

However, Coral Sun Airways declares on its website that the company is considering purchasing a larger aircraft, capable of flying to the Line Islands and the [[Phoenix Islands]].

==History==
During [[World War II]], the [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] used the airport as a refuelling stop on its Pacific transport route from Hawaii to [[Kanton Island]] for flights to Australia and New Zealand as well as a staging point for attacks on the [[Gilbert Islands]], then occupied by Japan. The airport was expanded considerably during the war, and the World War II runway configuration can still be seen as abandoned runways and aircraft parking areas in aerial photography.
<ref>{{Air Force Historical Research Agency}}</ref>

== Name ==
Cassidy International Airport was originally named after a United States Army World War II pilot, Wilbur Layton Casady, whose plane crashed near the island on March 23, 1942.  The name remained until sometime in the 1980s and was referenced in many books and a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' article on fishing in Kiribati.  It is unclear when the spelling changed, but it now uses the spelling 'Cassidy' International Airport.

On 29 August 2008, [[Air Pacific]] (now Fiji Airways) announced they would suspend flights to and from the airport as of 2 September 2008.

A '''sock puppet''' is a puppet made from a sock or similar garment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sock%20puppet|title=Definition of SOCK PUPPET|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}</ref> The puppeteer wears the sock on a hand and lower arm as if it were a glove, with the puppet's mouth being formed by the region between the sock's heel and toe, and the puppeteer's thumb acting as the jaw. The arrangement of the fingers forms the shape of a mouth, which is sometimes padded with a hard piece of felt, often with a tongue glued inside.Sock puppets are scary. They make me wanna cry and curl up into a ball. If Wikipedia edits this, I will delete their Minecraft account.

The sock is stretched out fully so that it is long enough to cover the puppeteer's wrist and part of the arm. Often, the puppeteer hides behind a stand and raise the hand above it so that only the puppet is visible. Sock puppeteers may also stand in full view along with their puppets and hold conversations with them using [[ventriloquism]].

==Composition==
Sock puppets can be made from socks or stockings of any color.  Any sock may be used to create a puppet, but socks that are too tattered may fall apart during a performance, so they are usually bought new. Additions can be glued on in order to give the sock a personality. Streamers and felt strings might be glued on for hair. Buttons or [[googly eyes]] (obtained from craft or fabric stores) are used for the puppet's eyes.

==Uses==
Sock puppets are often used for the education and entertainment of children. They can be used in elaborate puppet shows or children's plays, much as marionettes would be. The process of making sock puppets is popularly taught as a creative activity in elementary schools. Many schools teach children to make sock puppets, which the students use to stage a [[play (theatre)|play]] or [[Musical theatre|musical]].

[[Image:Mick Foley and Socko.jpg|thumb|left|Pro wrestler [[Mick Foley]] and his accomplice, Mr. Socko]]
Sock puppets appear in [[children's television series]] where they can be used alone on the puppeteer's hand, without a complex stage or show. Two orange sock puppets named Fu and Fara are used in teaching German children how to read.  In the United States, children's entertainer [[Shari Lewis]] was known for her television show ''[[Lamb Chop's Play-Along]]'' featuring the sock puppets [[Lamb Chop (puppet)|Lamb Chop]], Charlie Horse, and Hush Puppy. Sock puppets are often used because they are less intimidating and scary, and, therefore, very child-friendly.

Sock puppets have also been used in television programming aimed at adults. The 1980s saw the introduction of the [[Ed the Sock]] character on local cable in Toronto, and the ''[[Sifl and Olly]]'' show aired on [[MTV]] in the 1990s. Both of these were aimed at teenagers and young adults. Sock puppets have also appeared in advertising geared towards adults. During the late 1990s, the [[ecommerce]] company ''[[Pets.com]]'' used a \"spokespuppet\" in its advertising to much critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.internetworld.com/magazine.php?inc=121500/12.15.00fastforward2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602151348/http://www.internetworld.com/magazine.php?inc=121500%2F12.15.00fastforward2.html |archive-date=2 June 2008 |title=Fast Forward Catching Up With: Pets.com's Spokespuppet |work=Internet World Magazine |publisher=Internet World |date=15 December 2000 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>

Sock puppets have also been used as the main figures in comedy videos on the internet, mostly to parody other media phenomena such as films and television series. Additionally, sock puppets have been used in a variety of Human Resource videos to aid in the education of employees regarding effective business practices.

[[Professional wrestling|Professional wrestler]] [[Mick Foley]] has long used a sock puppet by the name of Mr. Socko as an aid in his finishing maneuver, a nerve hold called the Mandible Claw (or Socko Claw), which is usually preceded by Foley theatrically pulling the sock from somewhere on his person. On [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]'s ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' program, this has traditionally been a cue for commentator [[Jerry Lawler]] to complain about \"that stinking, sweaty sock!\" Mr. Socko has often served as a sidekick for Foley's Mankind character, having been introduced to the world during a skit on WWE television as a means of \"cheering up\" WWE owner [[Vince McMahon]], who had just been beaten by nemesis [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. The sock puppet unexpectedly became a hit with wrestling fans, garnering chants from a crowd of more than 10,000 at the following week's program.

'''Bill Howard''' (born William Patrick Howard in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]) is a Catholic journalist who is media director for [[The Cor Project]].<ref>http://www.corproject.com</ref> He is formerly the editor in chief of ''The Colorado Catholic Herald''<ref>http://www.coloradocatholicherald.com</ref> for the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Colorado Springs]]<ref>http://www.diocs.org</ref> and producer and engineer of Bishop [[Michael John Sheridan]]'s weekly Catholic radio show, ''Bishop Sheridan Presents''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.coloradocatholicherald.com/Sections/AudioVideo.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216203410/http://www.coloradocatholicherald.com/Sections/AudioVideo.aspx |archive-date=2013-02-16 |url-status=dead|df= }}</ref>

== Biography ==
Raised in New Jersey, Howard graduated from [[Holy Cross Academy (New Jersey)|Holy Cross High School]] in Delran in 1987 and from the [[University of Scranton]] (Pennsylvania) in 1991 with majors in Philosophy and English, and a concentration in communications. From 1988 to 1990, he was sports editor of the student newspaper, ''The Aquinas''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aquinas.jlcclients.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511050041/http://aquinas.jlcclients.com/ |archive-date=2012-05-11 |url-status=dead|df= }}</ref>

=== Secular journalism experience ===
Howard joined [[Steve Forbes|Forbes Newspapers]] in [[Somerville, New Jersey]], in July 1992 and served as the primary sportswriter and copy editor of ''The Metuchen-Edison Review'' and ''Highland Park Herald'' weekly community newspapers. In January 1995, he joined the staff of ''College Sports'' magazine in [[Whitehouse Station, New Jersey|Whitehouse Station, N.J.]], where he was the primary copy editor of seven professional and college sports yearbooks, and a copy editor and occasional contributor to ''College Sports'' monthly magazine. He continued his sportswriting as a feature writer for publications by the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Dallas Stars]], [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] and [[Mesquite Championship Rodeo]] from 1997-2005.

=== Catholic press experience ===
In the summer of 1997, Howard moved to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], and joined the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas|Dallas Diocese]] semimonthly newspaper ''Texas Catholic'' as a staff writer. He eventually became the news editor and helped found the paper's website and blog. He left ''Texas Catholic'' in the spring of 2005 to become editor of ''The Colorado Catholic Herald''. During his time at ''Texas Catholic'' he won seven [[Catholic Press Association]] (CPA) awards, two Katie awards from the Dallas Press Club, and covered in person the death of [[Pope John Paul II]] from [[Poland]] and the subsequent [[Papal conclave, 2005|papal conclave]] in [[Rome]] in April 2005.

Bishop Sheridan hired Howard to restructure operations and redesign the [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] diocesan newspaper in June 2005. With a staff of four, ''The Catholic Herald'' added \"Colorado\" to its name and upgraded its frequency from monthly to twice a month (first and third Fridays). In May 2006, the ''Herald'' won the CPA's First Place General Excellence award in its circulation category (17,001-40,000 households), the highest award the paper can win. From 2006 until his departure in 2014, the ''Herald'' had won two dozen CPA awards. Circulation of the ''Herald'' remained steady at nearly 30,000 registered households.

'''Bill Howard''' (born William Patrick Howard in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]) is a Catholic journalist who is media director for [[The Cor Project]].<ref>http://www.corproject.com</ref> He is formerly the editor in chief of ''The Colorado Catholic Herald''<ref>http://www.coloradocatholicherald.com</ref> for the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Colorado Springs]]<ref>http://www.diocs.org</ref> and producer and engineer of Bishop [[Michael John Sheridan]]'s weekly Catholic radio show, ''Bishop Sheridan Presents''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.coloradocatholicherald.com/Sections/AudioVideo.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216203410/http://www.coloradocatholicherald.com/Sections/AudioVideo.aspx |archive-date=2013-02-16 |url-status=dead|df= }}</ref>

== Biography ==
Raised in New Jersey, Howard graduated from [[Holy Cross Academy (New Jersey)|Holy Cross High School]] in Delran in 1987 and from the [[University of Scranton]] (Pennsylvania) in 1991 with majors in Philosophy and English, and a concentration in communications. From 1988 to 1990, he was sports editor of the student newspaper, ''The Aquinas''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aquinas.jlcclients.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511050041/http://aquinas.jlcclients.com/ |archive-date=2012-05-11 |url-status=dead|df= }}</ref>

=== Secular journalism experience ===
Howard joined [[Steve Forbes|Forbes Newspapers]] in [[Somerville, New Jersey]], in July 1992 and served as the primary sportswriter and copy editor of ''The Metuchen-Edison Review'' and ''Highland Park Herald'' weekly community newspapers. In January 1995, he joined the staff of ''College Sports'' magazine in [[Whitehouse Station, New Jersey|Whitehouse Station, N.J.]], where he was the primary copy editor of seven professional and college sports yearbooks, and a copy editor and occasional contributor to ''College Sports'' monthly magazine. He continued his sportswriting as a feature writer for publications by the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Dallas Stars]], [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] and [[Mesquite Championship Rodeo]] from 1997-2005.

=== Catholic press experience ===
In the summer of 1997, Howard moved to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], and joined the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas|Dallas Diocese]] semimonthly newspaper ''Texas Catholic'' as a staff writer. He eventually became the news editor and helped found the paper's website and blog. He left ''Texas Catholic'' in the spring of 2005 to become editor of ''The Colorado Catholic Herald''. During his time at ''Texas Catholic'' he won seven [[Catholic Press Association]] (CPA) awards, two Katie awards from the Dallas Press Club, and covered in person the death of [[Pope John Paul II]] from [[Poland]] and the subsequent [[Papal conclave, 2005|papal conclave]] in [[Rome]] in April 2005.

Bishop Sheridan hired Howard to restructure operations and redesign the [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] diocesan newspaper in June 2005. With a staff of four, ''The Catholic Herald'' added \"Colorado\" to its name and upgraded its frequency from monthly to twice a month (first and third Fridays). In May 2006, the ''Herald'' won the CPA's First Place General Excellence award in its circulation category (17,001-40,000 households), the highest award the paper can win. From 2006 until his departure in 2014, the ''Herald'' had won two dozen CPA awards. Circulation of the ''Herald'' remained steady at nearly 30,000 registered households. During this time, Howard also expanded the ''Herald's'' reach by adding a radio studio to the office, and brought the ''Herald'' into social media. Among his editorial highlights are covering [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s return to [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], in the fall of 2006 and [[World Youth Day 2008|World Youth Day]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], in 2008.

In 2010, Howard was elected to the Catholic Press Association board of directors for a three-year term, and was re-elected in 2013. In 2012, he was named co-chair of the 2013 Catholic Media Conference, held in Denver June 19–21.<ref>http://www.catholicpress.org/events/event_details.asp?id=291342</ref>

The redecorated hall was intended to evoke features of 'shock' and 'amazement' in the viewers' minds; the room from where views of the waterfall were taken was lined with mirrors which made the spectator imagine that the water was appearing from all angles. William Wordsworth composed a poem which described the 'World of Wonder' in this room. Another description states that in the 1780s, visitors entering were met by a painting of Ossian serenading a group of maidens. The guide operated a device that withdrew the painting into the wall, providing access to another room - a hall of mirrors - giving the illusion of water pouring all around reflecting the river cascading outside.<ref name=\"Scotland\">[http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/othersport.cfm?id=508962003 Scotland on Sunday article.]</ref> In 1803 the hall had walks that were intersected, here and there, by a small garden of fine flowers among rocks and stones'. These small-scale gardens have since gone.

In 1803 [[Dorothy Wordsworth]] wrote \"''The waterfall, which we came to see, warned us by a loud roaring that we might expect it; we first, however, conducted into a small compartment, where the gardener desired us to look at a painting of the figure of Ossian, which, while he was telling us the story of the young artist who performed the work, disappeared, parting in the middle, flying asunder as if by the touch of magic, and lo! we are at the entrance of a splendid room, which was almost dizzy and alive with waterfalls, that tumbled in all directions - the great cascade, which was opposite to the window that faced us, being reflected in innumerable mirrors upon the ceiling and against the walls''\".<ref>Wordsworth, Dorothy (1894).

A '''mushroom rock''', also called '''rock pedestal,''' or a '''pedestal rock''', is a naturally occurring rock whose shape, as its name implies, resembles a mushroom. The rocks are deformed in a number of different ways: by [[erosion]] and [[weathering]], glacial action, or from a sudden disturbance. Mushroom rocks are related to, but different from, ''[[yardang]]''.<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/facts-on-file-sl-earth-science-handbook/d/24694507 The Facts on File. Earth Science Handbook]</ref>

A mushroom rock, rock pedestal, or gour is a typical mushroom-shaped landform that is formed by the action of wind erosion. At an average height of {{convert|2|to|3|ft|spell=in|1|}} from the base, the material-carrying  capacity of the wind is at its maximum, so abrasion (erosion by wind in which transported materials hit an exposed rock surface and polish it or scratch it) is also maximized. In some cases, harder rocks are arranged horizontally over a softer rock, resulting in such erosion.

==Erosion==
Usuall found in [[desert]] areas, these rocks form over thousands of years when [[wind erosion]] of an isolated rocky outcrop progresses at a different rate at its bottom than at its top. Abrasion by wind-borne grains of sand is most prevalent within the first {{convert|3|ft|spell=in|1|}} above the ground, causing the bases of outcrops to erode more rapidly than their tops. Running water can have the same effect. An example of this type of mushroom rock is the one in [[Timna Park]], Israel.

Occasionally, the chemical composition of the rocks can be an important factor; if the upper part of the rock is more resistant to chemical erosion and weathering, it erodes more slowly than the base. For example, erosion attributed to chemical weathering at the base of the rock due to the collection of dew near the surface.

A mushroom rock may ultimately form from an originally flat area of hard rock overlying soft rock, similar to the pattern of rocks that form a [[waterfall]]. Weathering of the exposed hard rock layer eventually exposes the lower rock to erosion from wind, water, salt intrusion, etc., depending on local conditions.  The layer of softer rock is more readily eroded, leading to the formation of a depression or blowout.  The overlying harder rocks are resistant to this process, and may ultimately end up as isolated mushroom rocks standing above the new, lower plain.

The nature of wind erosion is that it concentrates a few feet over the ground - wind speeds increase with height, but sediment load reduces.  This means that the combination of highest sediment loads and fastest wind speed exist a few feet over the ground, leading to the characteristic narrowing of the support pedestal at this height.

==Glacial action==
In contrast to a mushroom rock formed by erosion of a single rock, these mushrooms are a type of [[balancing rock]] that formed from two separate rocks, one of which came to rest on top of the other. Typically, the uppermost rock was transported and deposited by the slow action of a [[glacier]]. The lower part of the rock formation might or might not have also undergone a degree of erosion to accentuate the mushroom shape. Examples of this type of rock are Mushroom Rock in [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]], [[Tennessee]],<ref>[http://tnlandforms.us/landforms/m.php?wpt=SQR001 Mushroom Rock]</ref> and ''Le Champignon'' in [[Huelgoat]], France.<ref>[http://www.bretagne-celtic.com/carte_huelgoat.htm#CHAMPIGNON ''Le Champignon'']</ref>

==Rock disturbance==
This type of mushroom rock forms from two rocks, one of which came to rest on the top of the other, caused by a very sudden disturbance such as a rock fall or earthquakes.It is formed by erosion and weathering. It is a typical mushroom shaped land form that is found in places like deserts and etc.

'''''Someone in Control''''' is the third studio album by American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Trapt]], released on September 13, 2005 by [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The album debuted at number 14 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, with approximatively 61,400 copies sold.<ref name=\"billboard\">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=trapt|chart=all}}|title=Someone in Control - Trapt|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> Three singles were released: \"[[Stand Up (Trapt song)|Stand Up]]\", \"[[Waiting (Trapt song)|Waiting]]\", and \"Disconnected (Out of Touch)\". ''Someone in Control'' was co-produced by [[Trapt]] and Don Gilmore. The lyrics were written by Chris Brown, music written by Trapt. As of April 2006, the album has sold 263,000 copies.{{cn|date=March 2020}}

Despite the anticipation before the release, the album failed to catch the success of their debut album, possibly due to the lack of a hit single, and it was accidentally produced using last-second timing due to a failed trio-agreement with one insider. Following the disappointing sales of the album, Trapt was asked to leave from Warner Bros. Records.

'''Trindade''' is a station on the [[Porto Metro]] system in [[Porto]], [[Portugal]].

==History==

The modern metro station was built on the site of the former Trindade railway station, which was the central terminus for services to Porto from [[Trofa, Portugal|Trofa]], [[Póvoa do Varzim]] and the [[Guimarães line]]. Trindade was also the main entry point for the tunnelling machine which excavated the tunnels for Line D in central Porto.

==Services==

It is the only station where Lines A, B, C, E and F (which run as one line within the metropolitan area) intersect with Line D. It is in the centre of Porto and is the busiest station in the system by passenger numbers. On Lines A, B, C, E, and F it is preceded by Bolhão and followed by Lapa, while on Line D it is preceded by Aliados and followed by Faria Guimarães.<ref name=\"schwandl\">{{Cite web|last=Schwandl|first=Robert|url=http://www.urbanrail.net/eu/pt/porto/porto.htm|title=UrbanRail.Net &gt; Europe &gt; Porto &gt; Porto Metro|accessdate=12 February 2017}}</ref> The platforms for the A/B/C/E/F lines are at ground level under a sheltered roof, while the Line D trains are underground.

== Passengers ==
In 2004, 14.8% of all ticket validations on the network were made at Trindade, down from 23.7% the previous year due to the opening of the Bolhão and [[Estádio do Dragão]] stations, but still comfortably the highest.

The station entrance and lower concourse are often used for fundraising and promotional events.

==Building==

===Design===
The station was designed by the renowned Portuguese architect and [[Pritzker Prize]] winner [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]].

The platforms for the ABCEF line are at ground level under a sheltered roof. On this level, there are three platforms, with one being the old terminus for line Bx, which has since moved to [[Estádio do Dragão]]. To get to the far go-through platform for trains heading north, there is an underpass. The line D trains are underground, and the underpass must also be used to get to line D, whose platforms are underneath the underpass.

Spelling error,safe,Hoteltwo,"'''Operation Washtub''' was a top secret joint operation between the [[United States Air Force]], and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. Primarily lead by [[J. Edgar Hoover|J Edgar Hoover]] then his protege [[Joseph Carroll (DIA)]],<ref>http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/31/us-trained-alaskans-as-secret-stay-behind-agents.html</ref> the Operation was carried out during the [[Cold War]] with the primary goal of leaving [[stay-behind|Stay Behind]] Agents in the then [[Territory of Alaska]] for covert intelligence gathering, and a secondary goal of maintaining an evasion and escape facilities for captured friendly American Forces.<ref>http://www.governmentattic.org/12docs/FBI-USAF-AlaskastayBehindAgentProgram_1947-1954.pdf</ref> With the [[Soviet Union]] ultimately not invading the US through Alaska the program was active from 1950 and ended in 1959 when Alaska became a State.

== Selection and training of agents ==
The agents chosen for this operation needed to live locally, be able to move around, not be obvious targets for Russian invaders, and could not be military personnel. The proposal specifically states that fishermen and bush pilots would make good candidates. The selection of agents from Eskimo and Aleut peoples was also avoided due to the government's lack of trust in them.<ref>https://io9.gizmodo.com/declassified-documents-reveal-us-plan-for-alaska-during-1634021019</ref> Locations for the agents were also important; some of the locations included Anchorage, Fairbanks, Palmer, Big Delta and Cordova.

The agents were trained separately from one another due to concerns of capture or corruption to ensure that no other agents would be compromised. In addition to this the agents' training included simple methods of coding, observation and communication, scouting and patrolling, airdrop and pick-up techniques, close combat, and Russian uniforms and equipment. In order to fulfill the primary objective of this operation - the covert collection of intelligence information in the Alaskan Territory - the agents were also interested in military information, and any intelligence that they deemed to be important. For coordination between the leaders of the operation and its agents there were Administrator Liaisons for the agents to contact. For this operation the agents were equipped with 30-06 rifles with a times 4 scope, a small calibre pistol with a maxim silencer, camera, climbing rope and various other things to keep the agents alive, all supplied by the government for the agents. The second part of the operation being a escape and evasion plan for downed American planes, this includes the supply caches that were available for all sections of the US military. During the operation the agents were paid an inactive fund of 3,000 dollars per year, which was said to be doubled once the invasion was to begin.

At the end of the operation there were a total of 89 agents presumably being placed in the various regions provided in the official document. Some of those agents being revealed as Dyton Abb Gillard,<ref>http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/31/us-trained-alaskans-as-secret-stay-behind-agents.html</ref> Guy Raymond, Ira Weisner, and most notably Bob Reeve<ref>[[Robert Campbell Reeve]]</ref> an alaskan bush pilot who was the founder of Reeve Airways. Ultimately the Operation ended due to the costs of maintaining the agents funds and the cost of supplying the caches in the unbearable weather.

Mishra's ''RSS: Myth and Reality'' is an early work on RSS and puts forward the RSS point of view.  It is often cited in academic sources for this reason.  According to Mishra, RSS believes that modernity destroys cultural identity and suffocates [[dharma]] and divides the Hindu people.  \"Signs of disintegration appear in the family, village and communal life\" in the words of [[Dattopant Thengadi]].  Mishra says, \"the ersatz, sloganistic secularism has done great harm to the nation.\"<ref name=stories>

Mishra's ''RSS: Myth and Reality'' is an early work on RSS and puts forward the RSS point of view.  It is often cited in academic sources for this reason.  According to Mishra, RSS believes that modernity destroys cultural identity and suffocates [[dharma]] and divides the Hindu people.  \"Signs of disintegration appear in the family, village and communal life\" in the words of [[Dattopant Thengadi]].  Mishra says, \"the ersatz, sloganistic secularism has done great harm to the nation.\"<ref name=stories>

'''''Craig J. Hansen''''' (born March 12, 1954) is an American [[novelist]] and [[professor]] from [[Wisconsin]], now living in [[Stillwater, Minnesota]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Hansen was born in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] and lived in [[Illinois]] from the age of 10 to 25. He earned a BA in Political Science (with a minor in English and Anthropology) in 1976, and an MA in English in 1980; both from the University of Illinois. In 1993 he completed a [[Ph.D]] in English at the University of Minnesota with a focus on [[Technical Communication]]. During the years between his MA and Ph.D, he worked in the computer industry in a variety of technical and managerial positions.

===Career===
Hansen has published several academic articles and a few short stories, but ''The Skeleton Train'' is his first novel. Published in 2010 by [[Sky Blue Waters Press]], ''The Skeleton Train'' tells the story of Jason Audley; what many have referred to as a modern-day [[Huckleberry Finn]]. Jason narrates a story that begins when he is fourteen in an industrial Illinois town. The story includes his closest friend, Davey, and a young woman they encounter while hopping [[Rail freight transport|freight trains]] called The Pheadra.<ref name=\"Sky\">

"clean up, removed stub tag",safe,Bellowhead678,"'''Thillai Kali Temple''' (Tamil: ) is a Hindu Temple located on the outskirts of the town of [[Chidambaram]], [[Cuddalore District]] [[Tamil Nadu]] in [[India]]. It was built by [[Chola]] King Kopperunjingan who ruled between 1229 and 1278.

==Temple==
This Temple is on the outskirts of the city of Chidambaram. Legend says that Goddess Kaali Devi moved here after losing to Lord Siva in the celestial dance contest.

It was an argument that who is superior, either 'Sivam' (Lord Siva) or Shakthi (Parvathi). In order to resolve thus, they performed a dance program at Chidambaram in front of Lord Vishnu, Lord Brahma and other deities. While they were playing dance, Lord Siva was about to be defeated.<ref name=Meena>{{cite book|title=Temples in South India|last=V.|first=Meena|publisher=Harikumar Arts|location=Kanniyakumari|year=1974|edition=1st|page=41}}</ref>

But knowing fully well Siva played \"Oorthuva Taandava\" i.e. raising one leg above his head. This \"Oorthuva Taandava\" is one of the posture in the dance. It could not be played by the women folk due to their modesty and shyness. In this Parvathi could not play equally well to this posture and agreed her defeat. She had to go outside the borders of the town in order to contain her haughtiness and to teach a lesson that Sivam and Shakthi are both equally important in our life.

'Thillai Kali' is a deity in anger. This anger was pacified by Brahma by Chanting Veda and also praising her. Because of the penance of Lord Brahma 'Kali' became cool. So that Goddess 'Thillai Amman' in this temple seems with four faces.

There are two main shrines in this temple. In the first west facing one the goddess is in her benign form called Brahma Chamundeeswari and she has four faces like god Brahma.In the east facing shrine she is in her ferocious form called Thillai Kali.The other important shrines are for goddess Saraswathi in the form called Veena Vidyambigai and for Dakshinamurthy where he has a female form called Kadambavana Dhakshina Rupini.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://temple.dinamalar|title=Thillai Kali|last=|first=|date=|website=Dinamalar Temple|publisher=DINAMALAR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

== History ==
Kali or Durga worship, also known as [[Shaktism]] ,entered into Tamil country from [[Gauḍa (city)|Gauda]] region (present day Bengal) before 7th Century C.E. [[Tantra|Tantric]] rituals were followed during the daily worship in the Kali temples. The situation changed when Cholas were in ascendancy . Cholas embraced Saivism as their religion and the rituals were based on Agamas rather than Tantric tradition. During the reign of Vikrama Chola (1118C.E to 1135 C.E) and his son Kulothunga -II and grandson Rajaraja-II the transition to Saivism was complete and Shaktism was relegated to subordinate role.

[[Category:Hindu temples in Cuddalore district]]","'''Thillai Kali Temple''' (Tamil: ) is a Hindu Temple located on the outskirts of the town of [[Chidambaram]], [[Cuddalore District]] [[Tamil Nadu]] in [[India]]. It was built by [[Chola]] King Kopperunjingan who ruled between 1229 and 1278.

==Temple==
This Temple is on the outskirts of the city of Chidambaram. Legend says that Goddess Kaali Devi moved here after losing to Lord Siva in the celestial dance contest.

It was an argument that who is superior, either 'Sivam' (Lord Siva) or Shakthi (Parvathi). In order to resolve thus, they performed a dance program at Chidambaram in front of Lord Vishnu, Lord Brahma and other deities. While they were playing dance, Lord Siva was about to be defeated.<ref name=Meena>{{cite book|title=Temples in South India|last=V.|first=Meena|publisher=Harikumar Arts|location=Kanniyakumari|year=1974|edition=1st|page=41}}</ref>

But knowing fully well Siva played \"Oorthuva Taandava\" i.e. raising one leg above his head. This \"Oorthuva Taandava\" is one of the posture in the dance. It could not be played by the women folk due to their modesty and shyness. In this Parvathi could not play equally well to this posture and agreed her defeat. She had to go outside the borders of the town in order to contain her haughtiness and to teach a lesson that Sivam and Shakthi are both equally important in our life.

'Thillai Kali' is a deity in anger. This anger was pacified by Brahma by Chanting Veda and also praising her. Because of the penance of Lord Brahma 'Kali' became cool. So that Goddess 'Thillai Amman' in this temple seems with four faces.

There are two main shrines in this temple. In the first west facing one the goddess is in her benign form called Brahma Chamundeeswari and she has four faces like god Brahma.In the east facing shrine she is in her ferocious form called Thillai Kali.The other important shrines are for goddess Saraswathi in the form called Veena Vidyambigai and for Dakshinamurthy where he has a female form called Kadambavana Dhakshina Rupini.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://temple.dinamalar|title=Thillai Kali|last=|first=|date=|website=Dinamalar Temple|publisher=DINAMALAR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

== History ==
Kali or Durga worship, also known as [[Shaktism]] ,entered into Tamil country from [[Gauḍa (city)|Gauda]] region (present day Bengal) before 7th Century C.E. [[Tantra|Tantric]] rituals were followed during the daily worship in the Kali temples. The situation changed when Cholas were in ascendancy . Cholas embraced Saivism as their religion and the rituals were based on Agamas rather than Tantric tradition. During the reign of Vikrama Chola (1118C.E to 1135 C.E) and his son Kulothunga -II and grandson Rajaraja-II the transition to Saivism was complete and Shaktism was relegated to subordinate role. Shiva the supreme god was also portrayed as the King of Dance (Nataraja) and in the mythology he defeated Kali in the dance competition. The symbolism of the victory of Saivism over Shaktism is unmistakable .

When the later Cholas constructed the grand Shiva temple in Chidambaram  it became the center of the town and the Thillai Kali temple location became the outskirts of the town.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Origins of Saivam by Dr.A.Padmavathi|last=|first=|publisher=Kumaran Publishers,Chennai|year=2002|isbn=|location=Chennai|pages=Pages 20 to 58}}</ref>

'''HMS ''G10''''' was a [[British G-class submarine]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] during World War I.

==Description==
The G-class submarines were designed by the [[Admiralty]] in response to a rumour that the Germans were building [[double hull|double-hulled]] submarines for overseas duties. The submarines had a length of {{convert|187|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22|ft|8|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|13|ft|4|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|703|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|837|LT|t}} submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. They had a partial double hull.<ref name=gg9>Gardiner & Gray, p. 90</ref>

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|420|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14.25|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the G class had a range of {{convert|2400|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=gg9/>

The boats were intended to be armed with one [[British 21-inch torpedo|21-inch (53.3&nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]] in the bow and two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&nbsp;cm)]] torpedo tubes on the beam. This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow. They carried two 21-inch and eight 18-inch torpedoes. The G-class submarines were also armed with a single {{convert|3|in|cm|1|adj=on}} [[deck gun]].<ref name=gg9/>

==Construction and career==
Like the rest of her class, ''G10''{{'}}s role was to patrol an area of the [[North Sea]] in search of German [[U-boats]]. While on exercises, the submarine collided with a merchant vessel resulting in the destruction of the bridge and the periscopes.<ref name=tall>{{cite book |title=HM Submarines in Camera: An Illustrated History of British Submarines |last=Tall |first=J.J |author2=Paul Kemp |year=1996 |publisher=Sutton Publishing |isbn=0-7509-0875-0 |page=50}}</ref> On 3 June 1916, following the [[Battle of Jutland]], [[HMS Titania|HMS ''Titania'']] instructed ''G10'' to locate and sink floating remains of {{HMS|Invincible|1907|2}} to prevent the capture of materials.<ref>Battle of Jutland Official Despatches. p. 28</ref> The submarine survived the war, and was sold for scrap in 1923.

==Background==
Monahan's mother died in a car crash when he was seven, he was separated from his sister when she was twenty months old. Following the crash his grieving father turned to alcohol and became a violent drunk, inflicting much of his angst on his subsequent partners and on the young Erwin. Monahan committed his first crime when he was ten, breaking into a sweet shop. He eventually notched up 53 criminal convictions, including for burglary, theft, criminal damage, assault and mugging and including the final two for murder for which he was sentenced to Life.

Monahan and his co-defendant, William Ross, whom he had met in a squat in London, were convicted of murdering theatrical agent Greville Hallam and [[solicitor]] Angus Cochran in 1982. Hallam was found [[strangled]] in his home in [[London]]. Cochran was murdered three months later after being [[mugged]]. Following the murders Monahan fled to France and joined the [[French Foreign Legion]], serving in [[Corsica]] and Africa. After receiving information from Ross, Monahan was traced by [[Scotland Yard]], and in August 1984 he handed himself in to the British Consul in [[Nice]].

Monahan and Ross both pleaded not guilty to murder on both charges, each blaming the other for the killings. Another man implicated in the murders, Paul Dunwell, avoided prosecution by agreeing to give evidence for the prosecution against the pair. Justice Otton, who presided over the case, described Monahan as \"brutal, vicious and callous\" and sentenced him to [[life imprisonment]] with a minimum term of 14 years, subsequently increased to 25 years by the [[Home Secretary]].<ref>{{Cite news

The '''Walther GSP''', ''Gebrauchs Sportpistole'' (Sport Pistol for Standard Use), is a single-action, precision targetshooting [[pistol]] made in [[Germany]] by [[Walther arms|Walther Sportwaffen]].  It has the same technical base as the [[Walther OSP]] and thus is almost identical in outward appearance, albeit slightly longer and heavier than the OSP.

The GSP was introduced on the world market in 1968 and was chambered for [[.22 Long Rifle]].  At the end of 1971, Walther began offering the pistol in [[.32 S&W Long]] Wadcutter as well.  Regardless of its original caliber, conversion units for the other caliber are available and easily interchangeable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}  The anatomical, adjustable walnut grips were also available, on order from Walther, for left-handed shooters.  In 1988, Walther introduced a fully adjustable (for pull, stop, and angle) two-stage trigger that athletes could retrofit their pistols with.

==Variants==
Some of the very early GSPs were missing the slide stop lever which wasn't incorporated until the 1970s.  The early model GSPs, from 1968 to 1977, had a manual safety catch on the left side of the frame.  This feature was omitted in 1977 because it was an unnecessary feature on a competition pistol.  Also throughout the years, the design of the ergonomic grips underwent several changes.

The GSP chambered for .32 S&W Long WC, sometime referred to as the GSP-C, was intended for use in competitions that only allowed centerfire cartridges.  In 1976, Walther offered the GSP MV, which stands for ''matt vernickelt'' (matte nickel finish).  The MV models were available in both .22 lr and .32 S&W Long calibers.

In 1992, Walther had a special limited edition of the GSP designated as the 25 Jahre (25th Anniversary Edition).  The frame of this model had a nickel finish and the bolt had a gold titanium finish.  At the time, these sold for 2,549 [[Deutsche Marks]].

In 1996, Walther produced a GSP Atlanta model commemorating the [[1996 Summer Olympic Games]] in Atlanta.  These ones also had the gold titanium finish on the bolt.

Today, there is also a more accurate version available known as the '''GSP Expert''' which has a vibration-absorbing Aluminum sleeve, containing inertial dampers, around the barrel.

The Walther GSP is a popular choice for the various 25 m pistol shooting events governed by the [[International Shooting Sport Federation|ISSF]] (some contested at the Olympic games).  The .22 short variant was used in [[rapid fire pistol]]. The .22 LR variant was used for the [[25 m Pistol]] (formerly \"Sport Pistol\"), [[25 m Standard Pistol]] while the .32 caliber variant was used in the [[25 m Center-Fire Pistol]] event.

Under the N.Y Safe Act the Walther GSP is now classified as an assault weapon under N.Y state law. It is also classified as an assault weapon under Chicago and Cook County laws due to the magazine being outside of the pistol grip.

The '''Walther GSP''', ''Gebrauchs Sportpistole'' (Sport Pistol for Standard Use), is a single-action, precision targetshooting [[pistol]] made in [[Germany]] by [[Walther arms|Walther Sportwaffen]].  It has the same technical base as the [[Walther OSP]] and thus is almost identical in outward appearance, albeit slightly longer and heavier than the OSP.

The GSP was introduced on the world market in 1968 and was chambered for [[.22 Long Rifle]].  At the end of 1971, Walther began offering the pistol in [[.32 S&W Long]] Wadcutter as well.  Regardless of its original caliber, conversion units for the other caliber are available and easily interchangeable.  The anatomical, adjustable walnut grips were also available, on order from Walther, for left-handed shooters.  In 1988, Walther introduced a fully adjustable (for pull, stop, and angle) two-stage trigger that athletes could retrofit their pistols with.

==Variants==
Some of the very early GSPs were missing the slide stop lever which wasn't incorporated until the 1970s.  The early model GSPs, from 1968 to 1977, had a manual safety catch on the left side of the frame.  This feature was omitted in 1977 because it was an unnecessary feature on a competition pistol.  Also throughout the years, the design of the ergonomic grips underwent several changes.

The GSP chambered for .32 S&W Long WC, sometime referred to as the GSP-C, was intended for use in competitions that only allowed centerfire cartridges.  In 1976, Walther offered the GSP MV, which stands for ''matt vernickelt'' (matte nickel finish).  The MV models were available in both .22 lr and .32 S&W Long calibers.

In 1992, Walther had a special limited edition of the GSP designated as the 25 Jahre (25th Anniversary Edition).  The frame of this model had a nickel finish and the bolt had a gold titanium finish.  At the time, these sold for 2,549 [[Deutsche Marks]].

In 1996, Walther produced a GSP Atlanta model commemorating the [[1996 Summer Olympic Games]] in Atlanta.  These ones also had the gold titanium finish on the bolt.

Today, there is also a more accurate version available known as the '''GSP Expert''' which has a vibration-absorbing Aluminum sleeve, containing inertial dampers, around the barrel.

The Walther GSP is a popular choice for the various 25 m pistol shooting events governed by the [[International Shooting Sport Federation|ISSF]] (some contested at the Olympic games).  The .22 short variant was used in [[rapid fire pistol]]. The .22 LR variant was used for the [[25 m Pistol]] (formerly \"Sport Pistol\"), [[25 m Standard Pistol]] while the .32 caliber variant was used in the [[25 m Center-Fire Pistol]] event.

Under the N.Y Safe Act the Walther GSP is now classified as an assault weapon under N.Y state law. It is also classified as an assault weapon under Chicago and Cook County laws due to the magazine being outside of the pistol grip.

The '''F-class escort ships''' were a class of fleet escorts ({{lang|de|Flottenbegleiter}}) used by the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during the [[Second World War]]. Ten ships were built in total, of a type roughly comparable to British [[frigate]]s or American [[destroyer escort]]s. They were the only such type of ship built by the ''Kriegsmarine''. The ten ships were not given names, but were designated ''F1'' through ''F10''.

==Construction==
The ships were built by [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] (F&nbsp;1 – F&nbsp;6), [[Kiel]], [[Blohm & Voss]] (F&nbsp;7, F&nbsp;8) and Wilhelmshaven dockyard (F&nbsp;9, F&nbsp;10). They entered service between 1936 and 1939. The ships were originally conceived as fast fleet or convoy escort ships that could also perform [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] and [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeping]] work. They were also used as a testbed class for a new high-pressure steam power plant intended for use in future [[destroyer]]s.

As a class, they were overloaded and over-engined, which contributed to severe hull stress and very poor sea-keeping characteristics; these flaws were partially remedied by extensive rebuilds between 1938 and 1940. The power plants likewise proved to be prone to frequent breakdowns, and most of the ships were removed from operational service during the later years of the war after machinery failures meant the ships spent more time in repair than in use.

==Use and administration==
With the exception of fleet service and convoy duties between 1939 and 1941, they spent most of the war in use as tenders or [[U-boat]] [[training ship]]s.  Between 1943 and 1945, the escort ships were grouped into five [[Surface flotillas of the Kriegsmarine#Escort flotillas|escort flotillas]] augmented by converted civilian craft as well as [[torpedo boat]]s of the ''[[Torpedoboot Ausland]]'' program.

==Ships==
[[File:Lot-2275-29 (26251121633).jpg|thumb|F-class ship in heavy weather]]
One ship, ''F&nbsp;9'', was sunk in December 1939 after being torpedoed by {{HMS|Ursula|N59|6}}. F 5 was damaged by a mine in the Baltic Sea and sank under tow 29 January 1945. F 3 was sunk by British aircraft 3 May 1945 and F 6 was sunk by US aircraft 30 March 1945. The others survived the war and were scrapped or sunk as target ships. One 'F' Class craft was blown up and sunk in Tobruk Harbour by a Black South African POW from the 2nd Division with a home -made explosive and a long wick that he hid in the hold and lit it. His name was Job Maseko. He was awarded the Military Medal for bravery.

The '''''Société d'Études Aéronautiques (SEA)''''' (\"Society for Aeronautical Studies\") was a [[France|French]] [[aircraft manufacturer]] founded in [[1916 in aviation|1916]] by [[Henry Potez]], [[Marcel Dassault|Marcel Bloch]], and [[Louis Coroller]] at [[Suresnes]].

Having been established amid the [[First World War]], the company was from its onset focused upon the manufacture of military aircraft. It quickly found work producing large numbers of combat aircraft on behalf of the French military. However, following the end of the conflict, a major glut in surplus aircraft and the cancellation of many outstanding orders rapidly pushed the company into dire straights. Some officials, like Bloch, decided to withdraw from the aviation sector entirely in light of the poor economic prospects of the early 1920s aviation market.

==History==
The formation of the Société d’Etudes Aéronautiques (SEA) can be largely attributed to the undertakings of two French engineers, [[Henry Potez]] and [[Marcel Dassault|Marcel Bloch]].<ref name = \"official hist\"/> Prior to SEA, Potez and Bloch had been talented [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]]s that decided to form a partnership to development and manufacture of their original design of [[propeller]]s, establishing the [[Société des Hélices Éclair]]. However, they soon sought to go beyond just manufacturing components, but to undertake the design and construction of whole aircraft, thus, they both joined forces with another friend, [[Louis Coroller]], to establish SEA.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> Its founding coincided with the [[First World War]], and thus much of its activity was heavily influenced by the demands and lack thereof from this conflict.<ref name = \"official hist\"/>

The company was originally engaged to manufacture the [[SPAD VII]] fighter [[licensed production|under licence]].<ref name = \"bill 371\"/> However, it soon developed its original designs and put those into production as well. Several early aircraft, starting with the [[SEA I]], proved somewhat unsatisfactory and requiring further development.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> However, one such aircraft, the [[SEA IV]], was selected for production for the French military. Once orders for 1,000 aircraft had been placed, Potez and Bloch founded a separate company, the ''Compagnie Anjou Aéronautique'' (\"Anjou Aeronautical Company\"), to undertake their production. This entity was established at [[Angers]] with a new partner [[Julien Bessonneau]]. However, the outstanding production order would ultimately be cancelled, causing fatal economic hardship for both companies.<ref name = \"bill 371\"/>

However, the company's fortune quickly reversed following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] that marked the end of the conflict. Without a major ongoing war driving demand, peace quickly led to a major downturn in the sale and production of aircraft, pushing many aviation companies to the brink. The French Government's aircraft manufacturing department allegedly lacked interest in providing support to any of the nation's manufacturers. Accordingly, many companies and individuals alike decided to withdraw from the aviation sector during the late 1910s and early 1920s in favour of other endeavours.<ref name = \"official hist\">{{cite web |url = https://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/passion/history/1916-to-this-day/1916-1945/# |title = History: 1916-1945 |publisher = [[Dassault Aviation]] |accessdate = 13 April 2020}}</ref>

SEA was [[wound up]] shortly after the conflict's end.
