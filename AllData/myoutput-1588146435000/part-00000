The group came from a variety of social, economic, and ethnic backgrounds as well as occupations, some with no prior political experience.\n\nHistorian [[Richard B. Morris]] in 1973 identified the following seven figures as key Founding Fathers: [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Jay]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], and [[George Washington]] based on the critical and substantive roles they played in the formation of the country's new government.<ref name=\"MorrisSeven\">Richard B.

The [[Stamp Act Congress]] of 1765 included representatives from nine colonies.]]\n\nThe [[First Continental Congress]] met briefly in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1774, consisting of 56 delegates from all [[thirteen American colonies]] except [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]]. Among them was [[George Washington]], who would soon be drawn out of military retirement to command the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Also in attendance were [[Patrick Henry]] and [[John Adams]], who, like all delegates, were elected by their respective colonial assemblies. Other delegates included [[Samuel Adams]] from Massachusetts, [[John Dickinson (politician)|John Dickinson]] from Pennsylvania and New York's [[John Jay]]. This congress, in addition to formulating appeals to the British crown, established the [[Continental Association]] to administer boycott actions against Britain.\n\nWhen the [[Second Continental Congress]] convened on May 10, 1775, it essentially reconstituted the First Congress. Many of the same 56 delegates who attended the first meeting participated in the second.<ref>Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 64\u201367.</ref> New arrivals included [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] of Pennsylvania, [[John Hancock]] of Massachusetts, [[John Witherspoon]] of New Jersey, and [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]] of Maryland, who was named as a late delegate due to his being Roman Catholic. Hancock was elected Congress president two weeks into the session when [[Peyton Randolph]] was recalled to Virginia to preside over the [[House of Burgesses]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] replaced Randolph in the Virginia congressional delegation.<ref>Fowler, ''Baron of Beacon Hill'', 189.</ref> The second Congress adopted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Witherspoon was the only active clergyman to sign the Declaration. He also signed the [[Articles of Confederation]] and attended the New Jersey (1787) convention that ratified the Federal Constitution.\n\nThe newly founded country of the United States had to create a new government to replace the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]]. The U.S. adopted the Articles of Confederation, a declaration that established a national government with a one-house legislature. Its ratification by all thirteen colonies gave the second Congress a new name: the [[Congress of the Confederation]], which met from 1781 to 1789.<ref name=\"Confederation Congress, Ohio Historical Society\">{{cite web |url=http://ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2327 |title=Confederation Congress |publisher=Ohio Historical Society |accessdate=October 23, 2010}}</ref> The [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] took place during the summer of 1787, in Philadelphia.<ref name=Jillson2009>{{cite book|title=American Government: Political Development and Institutional Change|author=Calvin C.

The [[Continental Association of 1774]] contains a clause<ref>Clause 2</ref> severely limiting the slave trade as part of the general boycott of British trade.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/notesonhistory00moorrich Notes on the history of slavery in Massachusetts], by [[George Henry Moore (author)]]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=UQcOo4csdzEC&pg=PA271 The Transatlantic Slave Trade: A History]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qwdQDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA228 The Loyalist Problem in Revolutionary New England]</ref>\n\nFranklin, though he was a key founder of the [[Pennsylvania Abolition Society]],<ref name=Wright_p125>{{cite book |first=William D. |last=Wright |title=Critical Reflections on Black History |year=2002 |page=125|publisher=Praeger Publishers |location=[[Westport, Connecticut|West Port]], [[Connecticut]]}}</ref> originally owned slaves whom he later [[manumit]]ted.

Columbia University.</ref> He nonetheless founded the [[New York Manumission Society]] in 1785, for which Hamilton became an officer. They and other members of the Society founded the [[African Free School]] in New York City, to educate the children of free blacks and slaves. When Jay was governor of New York in 1798, he helped secure and signed into law an abolition law; fully ending forced labor as of 1827. He freed his own slaves in 1798.

For example, [[Three-Fifths Compromise|Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3]] prescribes that \"three-fifths of all other Persons\" are to be counted for the apportionment of seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and direct taxes.  Additionally, in [[Fugitive Slave Clause|Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3]], slaves are referred to as \"persons held in service or labor\".<ref name=Wright_p125/><ref name=\"Freehling_TAHR_p85\"/> The Founding Fathers, however, did make important efforts to contain slavery. Many Northern states had adopted legislation to end or significantly reduce slavery during and after the American Revolution.<ref name=\"Freehling_TAHR_p85\">{{cite journal |last=Freehling |first=William W. |title=The Founding Fathers and Slavery |date=February 1972 |journal=The American Historical Review |volume=77 |pages=81\u201393 |number=1 |doi=10.2307/1856595|jstor=1856595 }}</ref> In 1782 [[Virginia]] passed a [[manumission]] law that allowed slave owners to free their slaves by will or deed.<ref name=Cambridge_p278>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Law in America| year=2008 |page=278}}</ref> As a result, thousands of slaves were manumitted in Virginia.<ref name=Cambridge_p278/> Thomas Jefferson, in 1784, proposed to ban slavery in all the Western Territories, which failed to pass Congress by one vote.<ref name=\"Freehling_TAHR_p85\"/> Partially following Jefferson's plan, Congress did ban slavery in the [[Northwest Ordinance of 1787]], for lands north of the [[Ohio River]].<ref name=\"Freehling_TAHR_p85\"/>\n\nThe [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]] was banned in all states except [[South Carolina]], by 1800. Finally in 1807, President Jefferson called for and signed into law a Federally-enforced ban on the international slave trade throughout the U.S. and its territories. It became a federal crime to import or export a slave.<ref name=\"Freehling_TAHR_p85\"/> However, the domestic [[slave trade]] was allowed, for expansion, or for diffusion of slavery into the [[Louisiana Territory]].<ref name=Freehling_TAHR_p85/>\n\n===Attendance at conventions===\nIn the winter and spring of 1786\u20131787, twelve of the thirteen states chose a total of 74 delegates to attend the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Nineteen delegates chose not to accept election or attend the debates. Among them was [[Patrick Henry]] of Virginia, who in response to questions about his refusal to attend was quick to reply, \"I smelled a rat.\" He believed that the frame of government convention organizers were intent on building would trample upon the rights of citizens.<ref>{{cite journal| title=The Summer of 1787: Getting a Constitution| last=Williams| first=J.

As the colony was founded by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] as a sanctuary for [[Baptist]]s, Rhode Island's absence at the Convention in part explains the absence of Baptist affiliation among those who did attend. Of the 55 who did attend at some point, no more than 38 delegates showed up at one time.<ref>See the discussion of the Convention in Clinton L. Rossiter, ''1787: The Grand Convention'' (New York: Macmillan, 1966; reprint ed., with new foreword by Richard B. Morris, New York: W. W. Norton, 1987).</ref>\n\n===Spouses and children===\nOnly four (Baldwin, Gilman, Jenifer, and Alexander Martin) were lifelong bachelors. Many of the Founding Fathers' wives, like [[Eliza Schuyler Hamilton]], [[Martha Washington]], [[Abigail Adams]], [[Sarah Livingston Jay]], [[Dolley Madison]], Mary White Morris and Catherine Alexander Duer, were strong women who made significant contributions of their own to the fight for liberty.<ref name=\"Griswold, Rufus 1855\">Griswold, Rufus (1855), ''The Republican Court, or, American Society in the Days of Washington'', D.

Altogether, 145 men signed at least one of the four documents. In each instance, roughly 50% of the names signed are unique to that document.

were characterized by success or failure, reflecting the abilities of these men as well as the vagaries of fate.<ref>Martin (1973)</ref> Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe served in highest U.S. office of president. Jay would be appointed as the first chief justice of the United States and later elected to two terms as Governor of New York. Alexander Hamilton would be appointed the first Secretary of the Treasury in 1789, and later Inspector General of the Army under President John Adams in 1798. \n\nSeven (Fitzsimons, Gorham, Luther Martin, Mifflin, Robert Morris, Pierce, and Wilson) suffered serious financial reversals that left them in or near bankruptcy. Robert Morris spent three of the last years of his life imprisoned following bad land deals.<ref name=\"Griswold, Rufus 1855\"/> Two, Blount and Dayton, were involved in possibly treasonous activities. Yet, as they had done before the convention, most of the group continued to render public service, particularly to the new government they had helped to create.\n\n===Youth and longevity===\n[[File:Death Age-Founding Fathers.svg|thumb|right|Death age of the Founding Fathers]]\n\nMany of the Founding Fathers were under 40 years old at the time of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776: [[Alexander Hamilton]] was 19, [[Aaron Burr]] was 20, [[Gouverneur Morris]] was 24.

Among those who lived into their eighties were [[Benjamin Franklin]], Samuel Whittmore, [[John Jay]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], [[John Armstrong Jr.]], [[Hugh Williamson]], and [[George Wythe]]. Approximately 16 died while in their seventies, and 21 in their sixties. Three ([[Burr-Hamilton duel|Alexander Hamilton]], [[Richard Dobbs Spaight]], and [[Button Gwinnett]]) were killed in [[duel]]s.

His bestselling book about Alexander Hamilton inspired the blockbuster [[Hamilton (musical)|musical of the same name]].\n\n[[Joseph J. Ellis]] \u2013 According to Ellis, the concept of the Founding Fathers of the U.S. emerged in the 1820s as the last survivors died out. Ellis says \"the founders\", or \"the fathers\", comprised an aggregate of semi-sacred figures whose particular accomplishments and singular achievements were decidedly less important than their sheer presence as a powerful but faceless symbol of past greatness. For the generation of national leaders coming of age in the 1820s and 1830s \u2013 men like [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Henry Clay]], [[Daniel Webster]], and [[John C. Calhoun]] \u2013 \"the founders\" represented a heroic but anonymous abstraction whose long shadow fell across all followers and whose legendary accomplishments defied comparison.\n\n<blockquote>We can win no laurels in a war for independence,\" Webster acknowledged in 1825. \"Earlier and worthier hands have gathered them all. Nor are there places for us&nbsp;... [as] the founders of states. Our fathers have filled them. But there remains to us a great duty of defence and preservation.<ref>Joseph J.

The group came from a variety of social, economic, and ethnic backgrounds as well as occupations, some with no prior political experience.\n\nHistorian [[Richard B. Morris]] in 1973 identified the following seven figures as key Founding Fathers: [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Jay]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], and [[George Washington]] based on the critical and substantive roles they played in the formation of the country's new government.<ref name=\"MorrisSeven\">Richard B.

The [[Stamp Act Congress]] of 1765 included representatives from nine colonies.]]\n\nThe [[First Continental Congress]] met briefly in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1774, consisting of 56 delegates from all [[thirteen American colonies]] except [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]]. Among them was [[George Washington]], who would soon be drawn out of military retirement to command the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Also in attendance were [[Patrick Henry]] and [[John Adams]], who, like all delegates, were elected by their respective colonial assemblies. Other delegates included [[Samuel Adams]] from Massachusetts, [[John Dickinson (politician)|John Dickinson]] from Pennsylvania and New York's [[John Jay]]. This congress, in addition to formulating appeals to the British crown, established the [[Continental Association]] to administer boycott actions against Britain.\n\nWhen the [[Second Continental Congress]] convened on May 10, 1775, it essentially reconstituted the First Congress. Many of the same 56 delegates who attended the first meeting participated in the second.<ref>Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 64\u201367.</ref> New arrivals included [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] of Pennsylvania, [[John Hancock]] of Massachusetts, [[John Witherspoon]] of New Jersey, and [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]] of Maryland, who was named as a late delegate due to his being Roman Catholic. Hancock was elected Congress president two weeks into the session when [[Peyton Randolph]] was recalled to Virginia to preside over the [[House of Burgesses]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] replaced Randolph in the Virginia congressional delegation.<ref>Fowler, ''Baron of Beacon Hill'', 189.</ref> The second Congress adopted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Witherspoon was the only active clergyman to sign the Declaration. He also signed the [[Articles of Confederation]] and attended the New Jersey (1787) convention that ratified the Federal Constitution.\n\nThe newly founded country of the United States had to create a new government to replace the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]]. The U.S. adopted the Articles of Confederation, a declaration that established a national government with a one-house legislature. Its ratification by all thirteen colonies gave the second Congress a new name: the [[Congress of the Confederation]], which met from 1781 to 1789.<ref name=\"Confederation Congress, Ohio Historical Society\">{{cite web |url=http://ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2327 |title=Confederation Congress |publisher=Ohio Historical Society |accessdate=October 23, 2010}}</ref> The [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] took place during the summer of 1787, in Philadelphia.<ref name=Jillson2009>{{cite book|title=American Government: Political Development and Institutional Change|author=Calvin C.

[[Benjamin Rush]] wrote a pamphlet in 1773 which harshly condemned slavery and beseeched the colonists to petition the king and put an end to the British [[African Company of Merchants]] which kept slavery and the slave trade going.

For example, [[Three-Fifths Compromise|Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3]] prescribes that \"three-fifths of all other Persons\" are to be counted for the apportionment of seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and direct taxes.  Additionally, in [[Fugitive Slave Clause|Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3]], slaves are referred to as \"persons held in service or labor\".<ref name=Wright_p125/><ref name=\"Freehling_TAHR_p85\"/> The Founding Fathers, however, did make important efforts to contain slavery. Many Northern states had adopted legislation to end or significantly reduce slavery during and after the American Revolution.<ref name=\"Freehling_TAHR_p85\">{{cite journal |last=Freehling |first=William W. |title=The Founding Fathers and Slavery |date=February 1972 |journal=The American Historical Review |volume=77 |pages=81\u201393 |number=1 |doi=10.2307/1856595|jstor=1856595 }}</ref> In 1782 [[Virginia]] passed a [[manumission]] law that allowed slave owners to free their slaves by will or deed.<ref name=Cambridge_p278>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Law in America| year=2008 |page=278}}</ref> As a result, thousands of slaves were manumitted in Virginia.<ref name=Cambridge_p278/> Thomas Jefferson, in 1784, proposed to ban slavery in all the Western Territories, which failed to pass Congress by one vote.<ref name=\"Freehling_TAHR_p85\"/> Partially following Jefferson's plan, Congress did ban slavery in the [[Northwest Ordinance of 1787]], for lands north of the [[Ohio River]].<ref name=\"Freehling_TAHR_p85\"/>\n\nThe [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]] was banned in all states except [[South Carolina]], by 1800. Finally in 1807, President Jefferson called for and signed into law a Federally-enforced ban on the international slave trade throughout the U.S. and its territories.

Nineteen delegates chose not to accept election or attend the debates. Among them was [[Patrick Henry]] of Virginia, who in response to questions about his refusal to attend was quick to reply, \"I smelled a rat.\" He believed that the frame of government convention organizers were intent on building would trample upon the rights of citizens.<ref>{{cite journal| title=The Summer of 1787: Getting a Constitution| last=Williams| first=J.

As the colony was founded by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] as a sanctuary for [[Baptist]]s, Rhode Island's absence at the Convention in part explains the absence of Baptist affiliation among those who did attend. Of the 55 who did attend at some point, no more than 38 delegates showed up at one time.<ref>See the discussion of the Convention in Clinton L. Rossiter, ''1787: The Grand Convention'' (New York: Macmillan, 1966; reprint ed., with new foreword by Richard B. Morris, New York: W. W. Norton, 1987).</ref>\n\n===Spouses and children===\nOnly four (Baldwin, Gilman, Jenifer, and Alexander Martin) were lifelong bachelors. Many of the Founding Fathers' wives, like [[Eliza Schuyler Hamilton]], [[Martha Washington]], [[Abigail Adams]], [[Sarah Livingston Jay]], [[Dolley Madison]], Mary White Morris and Catherine Alexander Duer, were strong women who made significant contributions of their own to the fight for liberty.<ref name=\"Griswold, Rufus 1855\">Griswold, Rufus (1855), ''The Republican Court, or, American Society in the Days of Washington'', D.

were characterized by success or failure, reflecting the abilities of these men as well as the vagaries of fate.<ref>Martin (1973)</ref> Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe served in highest U.S. office of president. Jay would be appointed as the first chief justice of the United States and later elected to two terms as Governor of New York. Alexander Hamilton would be appointed the first Secretary of the Treasury in 1789, and later Inspector General of the Army under President John Adams in 1798. \n\nSeven (Fitzsimons, Gorham, Luther Martin, Mifflin, Robert Morris, Pierce, and Wilson) suffered serious financial reversals that left them in or near bankruptcy. Robert Morris spent three of the last years of his life imprisoned following bad land deals.<ref name=\"Griswold, Rufus 1855\"/> Two, Blount and Dayton, were involved in possibly treasonous activities. Yet, as they had done before the convention, most of the group continued to render public service, particularly to the new government they had helped to create.\n\n===Youth and longevity===\n[[File:Death Age-Founding Fathers.svg|thumb|right|Death age of the Founding Fathers]]\n\nMany of the Founding Fathers were under 40 years old at the time of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776: [[Alexander Hamilton]] was 19, [[Aaron Burr]] was 20, [[Gouverneur Morris]] was 24.

Among those who lived into their eighties were [[Benjamin Franklin]], Samuel Whittmore, [[John Jay]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], [[John Armstrong Jr.]], [[Hugh Williamson]], and [[George Wythe]]. Approximately 16 died while in their seventies, and 21 in their sixties. Three ([[Burr-Hamilton duel|Alexander Hamilton]], [[Richard Dobbs Spaight]], and [[Button Gwinnett]]) were killed in [[duel]]s.

His bestselling book about Alexander Hamilton inspired the blockbuster [[Hamilton (musical)|musical of the same name]].\n\n[[Joseph J. Ellis]] \u2013 According to Ellis, the concept of the Founding Fathers of the U.S. emerged in the 1820s as the last survivors died out. Ellis says \"the founders\", or \"the fathers\", comprised an aggregate of semi-sacred figures whose particular accomplishments and singular achievements were decidedly less important than their sheer presence as a powerful but faceless symbol of past greatness. For the generation of national leaders coming of age in the 1820s and 1830s \u2013 men like [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Henry Clay]], [[Daniel Webster]], and [[John C. Calhoun]] \u2013 \"the founders\" represented a heroic but anonymous abstraction whose long shadow fell across all followers and whose legendary accomplishments defied comparison.\n\n<blockquote>We can win no laurels in a war for independence,\" Webster acknowledged in 1825. \"Earlier and worthier hands have gathered them all. Nor are there places for us&nbsp;... [as] the founders of states. Our fathers have filled them. But there remains to us a great duty of defence and preservation.<ref>Joseph J.
