In captivity, groundhogs reportedly live up to 14 years. Human development, which often produces openings juxtaposed with [[Secondary forest|second growth]] trees that are incidentally also favored by groundhogs, often ensures that groundhogs in well-developed areas are nearly free of predators, beyond [[humans]] (through various forms of pest control or roadkills) or mid-to-large sized [[dogs]].<ref>Lehrer, E.

Many of these predators are successful stealth stalkers so can catch groundhogs by surprise before the large rodents can escape to their burrows; badgers likely hunt them by digging them out from their burrows.

The nest chamber may be about twenty inches to three feet below ground surface. It is about sixteen inches wide and fourteen inches high. There are typically two burrow openings or holes. One is the main entrance, the other a spy hole. Description of the length of the burrow often includes side galleries.

This burrow is usually in a wooded or brushy area and is dug below the [[frost line]] and remains at a stable temperature well above freezing during the winter months.

They will eat many commonly grown vegetables, and their burrows can destroy farm ponds and undermine foundations.\n\nVery often the dens of groundhogs provide homes for other animals including skunks, red foxes, and cottontail rabbits. The fox and skunk feed upon field mice, grasshoppers, beetles and other creatures that destroy farm crops. In aiding these animals, the groundhog indirectly helps the farmer. In addition to providing homes for itself and other animals, the groundhog aids in soil improvement by bringing subsoil to the surface. The groundhog is also a valuable game animal and is considered a difficult sport when hunted in a fair manner.<ref>Schoonmaker, W.J., The World of the Woodchuck, 1966, pp. 129\u2013131</ref> In some parts of the U.S., they have been eaten.<ref name=\"Castro\">{{cite web|last1=Castro|first1=Everett J.|title=Celebrate Groundhog Day With Groundhog Recipes|url=https://www.motherearthnews.com/real-food/groundhog-day-groundhog-recipes|website=Mother Earth News|date=January 1984}}</ref>\n\nA report in 1883 by the New Hampshire Legislative Woodchuck Committee humorously describes the groundhog's objectionable character:<ref>Seton, Ernest Thompson, Lives of Game Animals, p. 328</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=The woodchuck, despite its deformities both of mind and body, possesses some of the amenities of a higher civilization.

He said it was possible to conclude, alternatively, that upright play-fighting is part of the woodchuck's behavioral repertory but rarely shown because of physical spacing and/or low social tolerance.<ref>Marmots, Social Behavior and Biology, 1989, David P.

W. J. Schoonmaker excavated 11 dens finding the earth removed from these averaged six cubic feet or four and eight-tenths bushels per den. The longest burrow was 24 feet plus 2 short side galleries. The amount of soil taken from this den was eight bushels and it weighed 640 pounds. The average weight of the earth taken from all eleven dens was 384 pounds.<ref>Schoonmaker, W. J., ''The World of the Woodchuck'' p. 108-109</ref> Though groundhogs are the most solitary of the marmots, several individuals may occupy the same burrow. Groundhog burrows usually have two to five entrances, providing groundhogs their primary means of escape from predators. Burrows can pose a serious threat to agricultural and residential development by damaging farm machinery and even undermining building foundations.<ref name=\"adweb\">{{cite web | url = http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Marmota_monax.html | title = Animal Diversity Web: Marmota monax | publisher = University of Michigan Museum of Zoology | last = Light | first = Jessica E. | accessdate = 2009-07-14 }}</ref> In a June 7, 2009 Humane Society of the United States article, \"How to Humanely Chuck a Woodchuck Out of Your Yard\", John Griffin, director of Humane Wildlife Services, stated you would have to have a lot of woodchucks working over a lot of years to create tunnel systems that would pose any risk to a structure.\n\nThe burrow is used for safety, retreat in bad weather, hibernating, sleeping, love nest, and nursery.\nIn addition to the nest, there is an excrement chamber. The nest chamber may be about twenty inches to three feet below ground surface. It is about sixteen inches wide and fourteen inches high. There are typically two burrow openings or holes. One is the main entrance, the other a spy hole. Description of the length of the burrow often includes side galleries. Excluding side galleries, Schoonmaker reports the longest was twenty-four feet, and the average length of eleven dens was fourteen feet.<ref>Schoonmaker, W.

Some of these holes were only a few feet deep and never occupied but the numerous burrows gave the impression that groundhogs live in communities.<ref>Seton, Ernest Thompson, ''Lives of Game Animals'', p. 318</ref>\n\n===Hibernation===\nGroundhogs are one of the few species that enter into true [[hibernation]], and often build a separate \"winter burrow\" for this purpose. This burrow is usually in a wooded or brushy area and is dug below the [[frost line]] and remains at a stable temperature well above freezing during the winter months. In most areas, groundhogs hibernate from October to March or April, but in more temperate areas, they may hibernate as little as three months.<ref name=\"rhodeisland\">[http://www.dem.ri.gov/programs/bnatres/fishwild/pdf/woodchuc.pdf Woodchucks in Rhode Island] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412090734/http://www.dem.ri.gov/programs/bnatres/fishwild/pdf/woodchuc.pdf |date=2007-04-12 }}.

They will eat many commonly grown vegetables, and their burrows can destroy farm ponds and undermine foundations.\n\nVery often the dens of groundhogs provide homes for other animals including skunks, red foxes, and cottontail rabbits. The fox and skunk feed upon field mice, grasshoppers, beetles and other creatures that destroy farm crops. In aiding these animals, the groundhog indirectly helps the farmer. In addition to providing homes for itself and other animals, the groundhog aids in soil improvement by bringing subsoil to the surface. The groundhog is also a valuable game animal and is considered a difficult sport when hunted in a fair manner.<ref>Schoonmaker, W.J., The World of the Woodchuck, 1966, pp. 129\u2013131</ref> In some parts of the U.S., they have been eaten.<ref name=\"Castro\">{{cite web|last1=Castro|first1=Everett J.|title=Celebrate Groundhog Day With Groundhog Recipes|url=https://www.motherearthnews.com/real-food/groundhog-day-groundhog-recipes|website=Mother Earth News|date=January 1984}}</ref>\n\nA report in 1883 by the New Hampshire Legislative Woodchuck Committee humorously describes the groundhog's objectionable character:<ref>Seton, Ernest Thompson, Lives of Game Animals, p. 328</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=The woodchuck, despite its deformities both of mind and body, possesses some of the amenities of a higher civilization.
