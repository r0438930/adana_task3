He was sentenced to 100 years in prison before being released in 2014 after serving almost 28 years.\n\nIn 1924, Christopher Furnari was born in New York to first-generation Sicilian-[[Italians|Italian]] emigrants from [[Furnari]], a commune in the [[Province of Messina]] in [[Sicily]]. By age 15, Furnari was managing his own [[loanshark]] operations in [[Brooklyn]] and Northern [[New Jersey]]. By 1943, the 19-year-old Furnari had already served two prison terms for armed robbery. Furnari was also sentenced to 15 to 30 years  \nafter he and several other youths were arrested with 3 girls in a car and charged with rape.\n\nIn 1956, Furnari was released from prison on [[parole]]. Furnari became an associate of [[Gaetano Lucchese|Gaetano \"Tommy Three-Finger Brown\" Lucchese]]'s crime family through Furnari's connection with mobster [[Anthony Corallo]]. During the late 1950s, Furnari became involved in [[illegal gambling]] and loansharking.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/> Furnari soon became an influential member of the Brooklyn faction of the family and was earning $25,000 a day. In 1962, at age 38, Furnari became a [[made man]] in the Lucchese family. In 1964, Furnari became a caporegime.\n\nThe Lucchese powerbase was traditionally in [[Manhattan]] and [[the Bronx]], the family's birthplace; the family's first three bosses, [[Gaetano Reina|Gaetano \"Tom\" Reina]], [[Tommy Gagliano|Tommaso \"Tommy\" Gagliano]], and Thomas Lucchese, were all from this area. In contrast, Furnari belonged to the less influential Brooklyn faction. Furnari operated his crew in [[Bensonhurst]] at the 19th Hole, a nondescript bar and mob social club.  His crew was involved in illegal gambling,<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/> [[loansharking]],<ref name=\"web.archive.org\">https://web.archive.org/web/20060103112838/http://www.geocities.com/mafia_genius2004/1986mobsters.html</ref> extortion, burglary, narcotics dealing, occasional murder contracts, & union & construction rackets.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/> At this time, Furnari's criminal record included convictions for assault and sex offenses.\n\nFurnari controlled New York District Council 9, which represented 6,000 workers who painted and decorated hotels, bridges, and subway stations in New York. Furnari managed the Council through the union secretary and treasurer, James Bishop, and Bishop's associate, Frank Arnold. Bishop and Arnold would pick up cash payments from the contractors, who charged a 10 to 15 percent tax on all major commercial painting jobs, and passed the payments to Furnari.\n\nThe 19th Hole, Furnari's social club, was the hub of criminal activity in Bensonhurst. Mobsters from every New York crime family conducted business in the club and socialized over food and drink. In the mid 1960s, aspiring mobsters [[Victor Amuso|Vittorio \"Vic\" Amuso]] and [[Anthony Casso|Anthony \"Gaspipe\" Casso]] joined Furnari's crew. Furnari saw that both men could make money and were willing to use violence if needed. Furnari put Amuso and Casso in charge of a large bookmaking operation and debt collecting operation.\n\nIn 1967, family boss Thomas Lucchese died of a [[brain tumor]], leaving the family to be run by an interim boss, [[Carmine Tramunti|Carmine \"Mr. Gribbs\" Tramunti]].<ref name=\"funeral\">Clines, Francis X.

Tramunti served as acting boss, even after Corallo was released from prison in 1970. In 1973, with Tramunti's imprisonment, Corallo finally became the official Lucchese boss.\n\nIn the early 1970s the [[Five Families]] of New York organized crime decided to \"open the books', allowing a new generation of mob associates to become [[made men]]. Furnari immediately sponsored Amuso and Casso for family membership and then made them overseers of the \"Bypass Gang\", a highly successful burglary ring. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Bypass Gang reportedly stole hundreds of millions of dollars in cash, jewelry, and other merchandise.\n\nIn January 1972, Furnari backed and sanctioned the squad of armed robbers who took the famed Pierre Hotel in Manhattan under siege and stole approximately $3 million  in jewels and cash. The [[Pierre Hotel robbery]] stands as the largest unrecovered hotel robbery in history. None of the perpetrators ever confessed to the heist, and only a diamond necklace valued at $780,000 was recovered. The case was never solved. The eight brazen armed robbers were: Robert Comfort, Sammy Nalo, Donald 'Tony the Greek', Al Green, Ali Ben, Bobby Germain, and Al Visconti.\n\nIn 1980, Furnari was promoted to [[consigliere]] in the Lucchese family.  He wanted Casso to take over as capo of the 19th Hole crew, but Casso declined and endorsed Amuso instead.  Casso opted to become Furnari's aide; a consigliere is allowed to have one soldier work directly for him.\n\nFurnari now enjoyed enormous influence both within his own family, the other New York families, and crime families from other US cities. Furnari continued to oversee his criminal interests from the 19th Hole, but spent much of his time providing advise and mediation for family members as well as settling disputes with the other families. Furnari reigned as one of New York's top Mafia bosses throughout the early 1980s until his 1985 racketeering indictment.\n\nOn February 25, 1985, Furnari was indicted in the [[Mafia Commission Trial|Mafia Commission]] case, the most comprehensive [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) prosecution brought against the mob at the time.<ref name=\"bosses arraigned\">{{cite news|last=Lubasch|first=Arnold H|title=Reputed Crime Bosses Arraigned|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/01/nyregion/reputed-crime-bosses-arraigned.html|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 1, 1985}}</ref> Furnari was indicted as a result of a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) probe that used undercover surveillance and bugging techniques against the mob leaders. The bug that snared Furnari had been placed in [[Salvatore Avellino]]'s [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] car. FBI surveillance recorded Corallo conducting business with Furnari and other family leaders. Pleading not guilty to the charges, Furnari was released on $1.75 million bail pending trial.<ref name=\"11 plead\">{{cite news|title=11 PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO RULING ORGANIZED CRIME IN NEW YORK|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/02/nyregion/11-plead-not-guilty-to-ruling-organized-crime-in-new-york.html?scp=2&sq=%22Christopher%20Furnari%22&st=cse|accessdate=19 November 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 2, 1985}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1986, while Furnari was awaiting the Commission trial, the Lucchese family uncovered a new, protentially lucrative racket. A Russian-American [[crime family]] based in [[Brighton Beach]] in Brooklyn, run by [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] immigrant [[Marat Balagula]], had started to [[counterfeit|bootleg]] gasoline. By collecting gasoline taxes from customers and then not paying them to the government, Balagula was making very large profits. When [[Colombo crime family]] capo [[Michael Franzese]] started pressing Balagula for extortion payments, Balagula went to Furnari for help. Casso later reported on a meeting at the 19th Hole, in which Furnari told Balagula, \n\n<blockquote>Here there's enough for everybody to be happy... to leave the table satisfied. What we must avoid is trouble between us and the other families. I propose to make a deal with the others so there's no bad blood.... Meanwhile, we will send word out that from now on you and your people are with the Lucchese family. No one will bother you. If anyone does bother you, come to us and Anthony will take care of it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carlo|2008|p=120}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs a result of the 19th Hole meeting, the [[Five Families]] imposed a two cent per gallon \"Family tax\" on Balagula's bootlegging operation, which became their greatest moneymaker after [[drug trafficking]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2000|p=53}}</ref> According to one former associate, \n\n<blockquote>The LCN reminded Marat of the [[apparatchik]]s in the [[Soviet Union]]. He thought as long as he gave them something they would be valuable allies. Then all of a sudden he was at risk of being killed if he couldn't pay to the penny.<ref>Robert Friedman, \"Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob has Invaded America,\" 2000. Pages 53-54.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to author [[Philip Carlo]], \n\n<blockquote>It didn't take long for word on the street to reach the Russian underworld: Marat Balagula was paying off the Italians; Balagula was a punk; Balagula had no balls. Balagula's days were numbered. This, of course, was the beginning of serious trouble. Balagula did in fact have balls -- he was a ruthless killer when necessary -- but he also was a smart diplomatic administrator and he knew that the combined, concerted force of the Italian crime families would quickly wipe the newly arrived Russian competition off the proverbial map.<ref>Philip Carlo, \"Gaspipe: Confessions of a Mafia Boss,\" 2008, page 152.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn June 12, 1986, one of Balagula's rivals, Russian gangster [[Vladimir Reznikov]], entered Balagula's nightclub in Brighton Beach. Reznikov pushed a [[9mm]] [[Beretta]] handgun against Balagula's skull and demanded $600,000 and a percentage of Balagula's rackets.

He insisted, however, on being treated at his home in Brighton Beach, where he felt safer. At home, Balagula asked Casso to come help him.

According to Casso, \"After that, Marat didn't have any problems with other Russians.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2000|p=55}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1986, Furnari went on trial in the famous New York Mafia Commission case along with Corallo and underboss [[Salvatore Santoro|Salvatore \"Tom Mix\" Santoro]]. The charges included extortion and labor racketeering within the construction industry and murder for hire of former [[Bonanno crime family]] boss [[Carmine Galante|Carmine \"Lilo\" Galante]]. Galante had been gunned down on July 12, 1979 allegedly on the orders of the Commission. Some have argued that Furnari wasn't on the Commission then and had no connection with the Galante hit. However, Furnari could not use this as a defense argument.\n\nBy the fall of 1986, Corallo realized that he, Santoro and Furnari would not only be convicted, but were facing sentences that would all but assure they would die in prison. Furnari persuaded Corallo that either Amuso or Casso should become the new boss. At a meeting in Furnari's home, Furnari, Amuso and Casso all agreed that Amuso should succeed Corallo as boss.\n\nOn November 19, 1986 Furnari was convicted on all counts, including the Galante murder.<ref name=\"convicts 8\">{{cite news|last=Lubasch|first=Arnold H.|title=U.S. JURY CONVICTS EIGHT AS MEMBERS OF MOB COMMISSION|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/20/nyregion/us-jury-convicts-eight-as-members-of-mob-commission.html?scp=1&sq=%22Mafia%20Commission%22%20trial&st=cse|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 20, 1986}}</ref> On January 13, 1987, Furnari was sentenced to 100 years in prison without parole and fined $240,000.<ref name=federal/><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/14/nyregion/judge-sentences-8-mafia-leaders-to-prison-terms.html?scp=11&sq=Christopher%20Furnari&st=cse \"JUDGE SENTENCES 8 MAFIA LEADERS TO PRISON TERMS\"] By ARNOLD H.

In 1993, Casso was also captured; however, in 1994 he struck a deal with the government to testify against Furnari and other family leaders.\n\nIn 1995, Furnari started challenging the \"no parole\" stipulation of his sentence in court. The government had previously revoked Casso's witness deal with prosecutors, and in 1996 Casso was sentenced to life in prison. Furnari's lawyers insisted that Casso's court testimony against Furnari was tainted.\n\nIn July 2000, the [[Third Circuit]] Federal Court of Appeals ruled that the parole board officials had been denying Furnari's parole eligibility on the tainted assertions of mob turncoat Casso. However, in 2001, the [[Bureau of Prisons]] National Appeal Board ruled that Furnari was a multiple murderer and was not eligible for [[parole]], based on what some people considered to be Casso's discredited testimony. On February 15, 2006, Furnari filed a [[habeas corpus]] petition in District Court claiming that the United States parole commission improperly had denied him parole. On June 20, 2007, the court denied his petition.\n\nFurnari was imprisoned in the Allenwood Medium [[Federal Correctional Institution]] (FCI) in [[Allenwood, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"inmate locator\">{{cite web|title=Christopher Furnari|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&needingMoreList=false&FirstName=Christopher+&Middle=&LastName=Furnari&Race=U&Sex=U&Age=&x=20&y=12|work=Bureau of Prisons inmate Locator|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> His projected release date was November 24, 2044, effectively a life sentence.

Born in 1934, DeFede grew up in the [[Queens]] borough of New York City.  In his early days, he operated a hot dog vendor truck in [[Coney Island, Brooklyn]], running [[Numbers game|numbers rackets]] on the side.  A close friend and [[American handball|handball]] partner of Lucchese leader [[Victor Amuso|Vittorio \"Vic\" Amuso]], DeFede was inducted into the family in 1986 after Amuso became boss.  \n\nDeFede's rise and fall in the New York mob can all be attributed to Amuso. In 1994, Amuso was convicted of federal [[racketeering]] and murder charges and sent to prison for life. Amuso then named DeFede his acting boss to replace [[Alphonse D'Arco]] with a weaker and more controllable man at the top, after D'Arco became a government witness. \n\nOn April 28, 1998, DeFede was indicted on nine counts of racketeering stemming from his supervision of the family rackets in New York's [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] from 1991 to 1996.  The prosecution reported that the Lucchese family had been grossing $40,000 per month from Garment District businesses since the mid-1980s.  In December 1998, DeFede pleaded guilty to the charges and received five years in prison.\n\nDuring the late '90s, Amuso's relationship with DeFede began to sour. Suspecting that DeFede was hiding money from the family, Amuso replaced him as acting boss with [[Steven Crea]], head of the family's powerful [[Bronx]] faction. Once Crea took over, family profits rose enormously. That was enough to convince Amuso that DeFede had been skimming profits; Amuso reportedly decided to have him murdered.\n\nOn February 5, 2002, DeFede was released from a [[Lexington, Kentucky]] prison medical center. Having heard of Amuso's plans to kill him, DeFede immediately became a government informant. DeFede provided details concerning the Garment District rackets and the protection rackets in [[Howard Beach, Queens]]. He also provided information leading to the convictions of Crea, [[Louis Daidone]], Dominic Truscello, Joseph Tangorra, [[Anthony Baratta (organized criminal)|Anthony Baratta]], and a number of family captains, soldiers and associates.  While testifying against [[Gambino crime family]] boss [[Peter Gotti]], DeFede testified that he only earned  $1,014,000, or approximately $250,000 per year, during his tenure as acting boss.

He was sentenced to 100 years in prison before being released in 2014 after serving almost 28 years.\n\nIn 1924, Christopher Furnari was born in New York to first-generation Sicilian-[[Italians|Italian]] emigrants from [[Furnari]], a commune in the [[Province of Messina]] in [[Sicily]]. By age 15, Furnari was managing his own [[loanshark]] operations in [[Brooklyn]] and Northern [[New Jersey]]. By 1943, the 19-year-old Furnari had already served two prison terms for armed robbery. Furnari was also sentenced to 15 to 30 years  \nafter he and several other youths were arrested with 3 girls in a car and charged with rape.\n\nIn 1956, Furnari was released from prison on [[parole]]. Furnari became an associate of [[Gaetano Lucchese|Gaetano \"Tommy Three-Finger Brown\" Lucchese]]'s crime family through Furnari's connection with mobster [[Anthony Corallo]]. During the late 1950s, Furnari became involved in [[illegal gambling]] and loansharking.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/> Furnari soon became an influential member of the Brooklyn faction of the family and was earning $25,000 a day. In 1962, at age 38, Furnari became a [[made man]] in the Lucchese family. In 1964, Furnari became a caporegime.\n\nThe Lucchese powerbase was traditionally in [[Manhattan]] and [[the Bronx]], the family's birthplace; the family's first three bosses, [[Gaetano Reina|Gaetano \"Tom\" Reina]], [[Tommy Gagliano|Tommaso \"Tommy\" Gagliano]], and Thomas Lucchese, were all from this area. In contrast, Furnari belonged to the less influential Brooklyn faction. Furnari operated his crew in [[Bensonhurst]] at the 19th Hole, a nondescript bar and mob social club.  His crew was involved in illegal gambling,<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/> [[loansharking]],<ref name=\"web.archive.org\">https://web.archive.org/web/20060103112838/http://www.geocities.com/mafia_genius2004/1986mobsters.html</ref> extortion, burglary, narcotics dealing, occasional murder contracts, & union & construction rackets.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/> At this time, Furnari's criminal record included convictions for assault and sex offenses.\n\nFurnari controlled New York District Council 9, which represented 6,000 workers who painted and decorated hotels, bridges, and subway stations in New York. Furnari managed the Council through the union secretary and treasurer, James Bishop, and Bishop's associate, Frank Arnold. Bishop and Arnold would pick up cash payments from the contractors, who charged a 10 to 15 percent tax on all major commercial painting jobs, and passed the payments to Furnari.\n\nThe 19th Hole, Furnari's social club, was the hub of criminal activity in Bensonhurst. Mobsters from every New York crime family conducted business in the club and socialized over food and drink. In the mid 1960s, aspiring mobsters [[Victor Amuso|Vittorio \"Vic\" Amuso]] and [[Anthony Casso|Anthony \"Gaspipe\" Casso]] joined Furnari's crew. Furnari saw that both men could make money and were willing to use violence if needed. Furnari put Amuso and Casso in charge of a large bookmaking operation and debt collecting operation.\n\nIn 1967, family boss Thomas Lucchese died of a [[brain tumor]], leaving the family to be run by an interim boss, [[Carmine Tramunti|Carmine \"Mr. Gribbs\" Tramunti]].<ref name=\"funeral\">Clines, Francis X.

Police Record A Mafia Funeral - Mourners at Services for Luchese Are Photographed] (July 16, 1967) New York Times</ref>  Lucchese's real successor, [[Anthony Corallo|Anthony \"Tony Ducks\" Corallo]], was convicted of bribery in 1967 and sentenced in 1968 to prison for two years. Tramunti served as acting boss, even after Corallo was released from prison in 1970. In 1973, with Tramunti's imprisonment, Corallo finally became the official Lucchese boss.\n\nIn the early 1970s the [[Five Families]] of New York organized crime decided to \"open the books', allowing a new generation of mob associates to become [[made men]]. Furnari immediately sponsored Amuso and Casso for family membership and then made them overseers of the \"Bypass Gang\", a highly successful burglary ring. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Bypass Gang reportedly stole hundreds of millions of dollars in cash, jewelry, and other merchandise.\n\nIn January 1972, Furnari backed and sanctioned the squad of armed robbers who took the famed Pierre Hotel in Manhattan under siege and stole approximately $3 million  in jewels and cash. The [[Pierre Hotel robbery]] stands as the largest unrecovered hotel robbery in history. None of the perpetrators ever confessed to the heist, and only a diamond necklace valued at $780,000 was recovered. The case was never solved. The eight brazen armed robbers were: Robert Comfort, Sammy Nalo, Donald 'Tony the Greek', Al Green, Ali Ben, Bobby Germain, and Al Visconti.\n\nIn 1980, Furnari was promoted to [[consigliere]] in the Lucchese family.  He wanted Casso to take over as capo of the 19th Hole crew, but Casso declined and endorsed Amuso instead.  Casso opted to become Furnari's aide; a consigliere is allowed to have one soldier work directly for him.\n\nFurnari now enjoyed enormous influence both within his own family, the other New York families, and crime families from other US cities. Furnari continued to oversee his criminal interests from the 19th Hole, but spent much of his time providing advise and mediation for family members as well as settling disputes with the other families. Furnari reigned as one of New York's top Mafia bosses throughout the early 1980s until his 1985 racketeering indictment.\n\nOn February 25, 1985, Furnari was indicted in the [[Mafia Commission Trial|Mafia Commission]] case, the most comprehensive [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) prosecution brought against the mob at the time.<ref name=\"bosses arraigned\">{{cite news|last=Lubasch|first=Arnold H|title=Reputed Crime Bosses Arraigned|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/01/nyregion/reputed-crime-bosses-arraigned.html|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 1, 1985}}</ref> Furnari was indicted as a result of a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) probe that used undercover surveillance and bugging techniques against the mob leaders. The bug that snared Furnari had been placed in [[Salvatore Avellino]]'s [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] car. FBI surveillance recorded Corallo conducting business with Furnari and other family leaders. Pleading not guilty to the charges, Furnari was released on $1.75 million bail pending trial.<ref name=\"11 plead\">{{cite news|title=11 PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO RULING ORGANIZED CRIME IN NEW YORK|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/02/nyregion/11-plead-not-guilty-to-ruling-organized-crime-in-new-york.html?scp=2&sq=%22Christopher%20Furnari%22&st=cse|accessdate=19 November 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 2, 1985}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1986, while Furnari was awaiting the Commission trial, the Lucchese family uncovered a new, protentially lucrative racket. A Russian-American [[crime family]] based in [[Brighton Beach]] in Brooklyn, run by [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] immigrant [[Marat Balagula]], had started to [[counterfeit|bootleg]] gasoline. By collecting gasoline taxes from customers and then not paying them to the government, Balagula was making very large profits. When [[Colombo crime family]] capo [[Michael Franzese]] started pressing Balagula for extortion payments, Balagula went to Furnari for help. Casso later reported on a meeting at the 19th Hole, in which Furnari told Balagula, \n\n<blockquote>Here there's enough for everybody to be happy... to leave the table satisfied. What we must avoid is trouble between us and the other families. I propose to make a deal with the others so there's no bad blood.... Meanwhile, we will send word out that from now on you and your people are with the Lucchese family. No one will bother you. If anyone does bother you, come to us and Anthony will take care of it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carlo|2008|p=120}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs a result of the 19th Hole meeting, the [[Five Families]] imposed a two cent per gallon \"Family tax\" on Balagula's bootlegging operation, which became their greatest moneymaker after [[drug trafficking]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2000|p=53}}</ref> According to one former associate, \n\n<blockquote>The LCN reminded Marat of the [[apparatchik]]s in the [[Soviet Union]]. He thought as long as he gave them something they would be valuable allies. Then all of a sudden he was at risk of being killed if he couldn't pay to the penny.<ref>Robert Friedman, \"Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob has Invaded America,\" 2000. Pages 53-54.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to author [[Philip Carlo]], \n\n<blockquote>It didn't take long for word on the street to reach the Russian underworld: Marat Balagula was paying off the Italians; Balagula was a punk; Balagula had no balls. Balagula's days were numbered. This, of course, was the beginning of serious trouble. Balagula did in fact have balls -- he was a ruthless killer when necessary -- but he also was a smart diplomatic administrator and he knew that the combined, concerted force of the Italian crime families would quickly wipe the newly arrived Russian competition off the proverbial map.<ref>Philip Carlo, \"Gaspipe: Confessions of a Mafia Boss,\" 2008, page 152.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn June 12, 1986, one of Balagula's rivals, Russian gangster [[Vladimir Reznikov]], entered Balagula's nightclub in Brighton Beach. Reznikov pushed a [[9mm]] [[Beretta]] handgun against Balagula's skull and demanded $600,000 and a percentage of Balagula's rackets. After Balagula acceded to his demands, Reznikov told him, \"Fuck with me and you're dead -- you and your whole fucking family; I swear I'll fuck and kill your wife as you watch -- you understand?\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Carlo|2008|p=153}}</ref>\n\nAfter Reznikov left the nightclub, Balagula suffered a massive [[heart attack]]. He insisted, however, on being treated at his home in Brighton Beach, where he felt safer. At home, Balagula asked Casso to come help him. Casso gave these instructions to Balagula, \"Send word to Vladimir that you have his money, that he should come to the club tomorrow. We'll take care of the rest.\"<ref>Philip Carlo, \"Gaspipe: The Confessions of a Mafia Boss,\" 2008, page 154.</ref> Casso also requested a photograph of Reznikov and a description of his car.\n\nThe next day, Reznikov arrived at Balagula's nightclub to pick up his money. Lucchese soldier [[Joseph Testa]] confronted Reznikov and fatally shot him. According to Casso, \"After that, Marat didn't have any problems with other Russians.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2000|p=55}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1986, Furnari went on trial in the famous New York Mafia Commission case along with Corallo and underboss [[Salvatore Santoro|Salvatore \"Tom Mix\" Santoro]]. The charges included extortion and labor racketeering within the construction industry and murder for hire of former [[Bonanno crime family]] boss [[Carmine Galante|Carmine \"Lilo\" Galante]]. Galante had been gunned down on July 12, 1979 allegedly on the orders of the Commission. Some have argued that Furnari wasn't on the Commission then and had no connection with the Galante hit. However, Furnari could not use this as a defense argument.\n\nBy the fall of 1986, Corallo realized that he, Santoro and Furnari would not only be convicted, but were facing sentences that would all but assure they would die in prison. Furnari persuaded Corallo that either Amuso or Casso should become the new boss. At a meeting in Furnari's home, Furnari, Amuso and Casso all agreed that Amuso should succeed Corallo as boss.\n\nOn November 19, 1986 Furnari was convicted on all counts, including the Galante murder.<ref name=\"convicts 8\">{{cite news|last=Lubasch|first=Arnold H.|title=U.S. JURY CONVICTS EIGHT AS MEMBERS OF MOB COMMISSION|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/20/nyregion/us-jury-convicts-eight-as-members-of-mob-commission.html?scp=1&sq=%22Mafia%20Commission%22%20trial&st=cse|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 20, 1986}}</ref> On January 13, 1987, Furnari was sentenced to 100 years in prison without parole and fined $240,000.<ref name=federal/><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/14/nyregion/judge-sentences-8-mafia-leaders-to-prison-terms.html?scp=11&sq=Christopher%20Furnari&st=cse \"JUDGE SENTENCES 8 MAFIA LEADERS TO PRISON TERMS\"] By ARNOLD H.

In 1993, Casso was also captured; however, in 1994 he struck a deal with the government to testify against Furnari and other family leaders.\n\nIn 1995, Furnari started challenging the \"no parole\" stipulation of his sentence in court. The government had previously revoked Casso's witness deal with prosecutors, and in 1996 Casso was sentenced to life in prison. Furnari's lawyers insisted that Casso's court testimony against Furnari was tainted.\n\nIn July 2000, the [[Third Circuit]] Federal Court of Appeals ruled that the parole board officials had been denying Furnari's parole eligibility on the tainted assertions of mob turncoat Casso. However, in 2001, the [[Bureau of Prisons]] National Appeal Board ruled that Furnari was a multiple murderer and was not eligible for [[parole]], based on what some people considered to be Casso's discredited testimony. On February 15, 2006, Furnari filed a [[habeas corpus]] petition in District Court claiming that the United States parole commission improperly had denied him parole. On June 20, 2007, the court denied his petition.\n\nFurnari was imprisoned in the Allenwood Medium [[Federal Correctional Institution]] (FCI) in [[Allenwood, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"inmate locator\">{{cite web|title=Christopher Furnari|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&needingMoreList=false&FirstName=Christopher+&Middle=&LastName=Furnari&Race=U&Sex=U&Age=&x=20&y=12|work=Bureau of Prisons inmate Locator|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> His projected release date was November 24, 2044, effectively a life sentence.

Born in 1934, DeFede grew up in the [[Queens]] borough of New York City.  In his early days, he operated a hot dog vendor truck in [[Coney Island, Brooklyn]], running [[Numbers game|numbers rackets]] on the side.  A close friend and [[American handball|handball]] partner of Lucchese leader [[Victor Amuso|Vittorio \"Vic\" Amuso]], DeFede was inducted into the family in 1986 after Amuso became boss.  \n\nDeFede's rise and fall in the New York mob can all be attributed to Amuso. In 1994, Amuso was convicted of federal [[racketeering]] and murder charges and sent to prison for life. Amuso then named DeFede his acting boss to replace [[Alphonse D'Arco]] with a weaker and more controllable man at the top, after D'Arco became a government witness. \n\nOn April 28, 1998, DeFede was indicted on nine counts of racketeering stemming from his supervision of the family rackets in New York's [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] from 1991 to 1996.  The prosecution reported that the Lucchese family had been grossing $40,000 per month from Garment District businesses since the mid-1980s.  In December 1998, DeFede pleaded guilty to the charges and received five years in prison.\n\nDuring the late '90s, Amuso's relationship with DeFede began to sour. Suspecting that DeFede was hiding money from the family, Amuso replaced him as acting boss with [[Steven Crea]], head of the family's powerful [[Bronx]] faction. Once Crea took over, family profits rose enormously. That was enough to convince Amuso that DeFede had been skimming profits; Amuso reportedly decided to have him murdered.\n\nOn February 5, 2002, DeFede was released from a [[Lexington, Kentucky]] prison medical center. Having heard of Amuso's plans to kill him, DeFede immediately became a government informant. DeFede provided details concerning the Garment District rackets and the protection rackets in [[Howard Beach, Queens]].
