It is near the nation's geographic centre. The city has been Rwanda's economic, cultural, and transport hub since it became the capital following independence in 1962. The city hosts the main residence and offices of the [[President of Rwanda]] and government ministries. The city is within the [[Provinces of Rwanda|province]] of Kigali City, which was enlarged in January 2006, as part of local government reorganisation in the country. Kigali's city limits cover the whole province; it is consolidated.

1908, which allowed commercial activity to begin in Rwanda in 1908.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=46}}{{sfn|Louis|1963|p=168}} The first businesses were established in Kigali that year by Greek and Indian

sidelining Rwandans in the judiciary.{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=127}} In this period, Kigali was one of two provincial capitals, alongside [[Gisenyi]].{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|p=135}} The difficulty of governing the complex Rwandan society, and a crippling famine, led the Belgians to re-establish the German-style indirect rule at the end of 1917.{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=130}} Musinga was restored to his throne at Nyanza, with Kigali remaining home to the colonial administration.{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|p=142}}{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=275}} This arrangement persisted until the mid-1920s,{{sfn|Des

officials and expansion of control.{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|p=210}} Kigali remained relatively small through the remainder of the colonial era, as much of the administration took place in [[Ruanda-Urundi]]'s capital [[Usumbura]], now known as Bujumbura in Burundi.{{sfn|Infor Congo|1958}} Usumbura's population exceeded 50,000 during the 1950s, and was the colony's only European-style

Butare was initially the leading contender to be the capital of the new independent nation, but Kigali was chosen because of its more central location.

On 8 April, Rwandan government forces attacked the RPF base in the parliament building from several directions, but RPF troops successfully fought back.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|pp=264\u2013265}} The RPF then began an attack from the north on three fronts, seeking to link up quickly with its isolated troops in Kigali.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=269}} The RPF advanced steadily, capturing large areas of the countryside to the north and east of Kigali,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=288}} but avoiding an attack on the city itself, because the city was too heavily defended.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=158}} They instead conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle Kigali and cut off supply routes,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=299}} as well as capturing the rest of the country.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=268}} By mid-June, the RPF encirclement was complete, and they began fighting for the city itself.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=421}} The government forces had superior manpower and weapons but the RPF fought tactically,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=421}} and were able to exploit the fact that the government forces were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=421}} The RPF took control of Kigali on 4 July,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=459}} a date now commemorated as the [[Liberation Day]] [[Public holidays in Rwanda|national holiday]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Official holidays |url=http://www.gov.rw/Official-holidays |accessdate=12 November 2013 |publisher=[[Government of Rwanda|gov.rw]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911035627/http://www.gov.rw/Official-holidays |archivedate=11 September 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAlthough damaged, the city's structure has recovered.\n\n==Geography==\n<!--[[File:Kigali SPOT 1095.jpg|thumb|right|Kigali seen from Spot Satellite]]-->\n[[File:KigaliSuburbs.png|thumb|300px|Map showing major suburbs of Kigali]]\nKigali is located in the centre of Rwanda, at {{Coord|1|57|S|30|4|E|type:city_region:BD|display=inline}}.{{sfn|CIA|2007|p=479}} The city is coterminous with the province of Kigali, one of the five [[provinces of Rwanda]] introduced in 2006 as part of a restructuring of local government in the country.{{sfn|BBC News (I)|2006}} The city has boundaries with the [[Northern Province, Rwanda|Northern]], [[Eastern Province, Rwanda|Eastern]] and [[Southern Province, Rwanda|Southern]] provinces.{{sfn|BBC News (I)|2006}} The city is divided into three administrative [[Districts of Rwanda|districts]]\u2014[[Nyarugenge District|Nyarugenge]], which lies in the south west, [[Kicukiro District|Kicukiro]] in the south east, and [[Gasabo District|Gasabo]], which occupies the northern half of the city's territory.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=11}} Kigali lies in a region of rolling hills,{{sfn|Munyakazi|Ntagaramba|2005|p=18}} with a series of valleys and ridges joined by steep slopes.{{sfn|REMA|2013|pp=7\u20138}} Kigali lies between the two mountains of [[Mount Kigali]] and [[Mount Jali]],{{sfn|Tumwebaze (I)|2011}} both of which have altitudes over {{convert|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}},{{sfn|ITMB Publishing|2007}} while the lowest areas of the city have an altitude of {{convert|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=7}} Geologically, the city lies in a [[granitic]] and [[metasedimentary]] region, with [[lateritic]] soils on the hills and [[alluvial]] soils in the valleys.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=5}}\n\nThe [[Nyabarongo River]], part of the upper headwaters of the [[Nile River|Nile]],{{sfn|BBC News (II)|2006}} forms the western and southern borders of the administrative city of Kigali,{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=4}} although this river lies somewhat outside the built-up urban area.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=6}} The largest river running through the city is the [[Nyabugogo River]], which flows south from [[Lake Muhazi]] before flowing west between Mount Kigali and Mount Jali, and draining into the Nyabarongo.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=8}} The Nyabugogo is fed by various smaller streams throughout the city, and its [[drainage basin]] contains most of Kigali's territory,{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=8}} other than areas in the south which outflow directly to the Nyabarongo.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=9}} The rivers are flanked by [[wetland]]s, which act as a water store and flood protection for the city, although these are under threat from agriculture and development.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=9}}\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n[[File: Suburban Sprawl in Kigali.jpg|thumb|left| Boulevard in Kigali]]\n\nThe [[central business district]] (CBD) (known in Kinyarwanda as ''mu mujyi'') of Kigali lies on [[Nyarugenge Hill]], and was the site of the original city founded by Richard Kandt in 1907.{{sfn|Tumwebaze (I)|2011}} The house that Kandt lived in is now the [[Kandt House Museum of Natural History]].{{sfn|Mbanda|2014}} Geographically, the CBD lies towards the western edge of the built-up area,{{sfn|Tumwebaze (I)|2011}} as the terrain to the east was more suitable for development of the expanding city than the high slopes of Mount Kigali to the west. Several of Rwanda's highest buildings, including the 20-storey [[Kigali City Tower]], are located in the CBD, as are the headquarters of the country's largest banks and businesses.{{sfn|The EastAfrican|2017}} Other buildings in the CBD include the upmarket [[Kigali Serena Hotel|Serena]], [[Kigali Marriott Hotel|Marriott]] and [[H\u00f4tel des Mille Collines|Mille Collines]] hotels,{{sfn|Mwai|2017}} the [[University Teaching Hospital of Kigali]],{{sfn|Google Maps (I)}} the national university's [[College of Science and Technology (Rwanda)|College of Science and Technology]],{{sfn|Google Maps (II)}} and government buildings such as the [[National Bank of Rwanda]]{{sfn|Google Maps (III)}} and the [[Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (Rwanda)|Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning]].{{sfn|Google Maps (IV)}}\n\nTo the south west of the CBD, and also on the Nyarugenge Hill, is the suburb of [[Nyamirambo]].{{sfn|The Week|2017}} This was the second part of the city to be settled, being built in the 1920s by the Belgian colonial government as a home for civil servants and [[Swahili people|Swahili]] traders.{{sfn|Tabaro|2014}} This latter group were mostly members of the [[Islam]]ic faith, which led to Nyamirambo being known as the \"Muslim Quarter\".{{sfn|Tabaro|2014}} Nyamirambo's [[Green Mosque (Kigali)|Green Mosque]] (''Masjid al-Fatah'') is the oldest mosque in Kigali, dating back to the 1930s.{{sfn|Rough Guides|2015}} Travel publisher [[Rough Guides]] has described Nyamirambo as \"Kigali's coolest neighbourhood\", citing its multi-cultural status and an active nightlife, which is not found in much of the rest of the city.{{sfn|Rough Guides|2015}} North of Nyamirambo, and west of the CBD is [[Nyabugogo]].

Most leave from the Nyabugogo bus station. These services include:\n* Modern Coast, a [[Kenya]]n coach and courier service which connects [[Gisenyi]]/[[Goma]] through [[Kyanika]] and Kigali through [[Gatuna]] to [[Kampala]] and [[Nairobi]].

There are also taxi minibus services ([[matatu]]s) leaving from Kigali, which also go through to the major towns, but some of them stop frequently along the route to pick people up or drop them off.\n\nPublic transport within Kigali is shifting from using small matatus to bigger city buses, which are connecting the most important sectors. These buses use a cash-free payment system called [[Tap&Go]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.igihe.com/news/ac-group-launches-tap-go-smart-payment-solution.html|title=AC Group launches Tap&Go smart payment solution for public transport|website=en.igihe.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}</ref> In 2017, matatus were still used to connect the more remote areas of the city. In contrast to the national express buses, these services wait to fill up before setting off from the terminus, then pick up and drop off frequently en route.\n\nKigali has many taxis (known as 'special hire' or 'taxi voiture'), which are generally painted white with an orange stripe down the side. Even more popular are motorbike taxis ('taxi moto'), which offer a service similar to a taxi, but for lower prices, typically in the range 300-1000 [[Rwanda franc|FRW]].\n\n==Future==\nUnder a master plan for 2040, Kigali will be decentralised, with business, shopping, and leisure districts, and suburbs. The plan calls for skyscrapers, arching pedestrian walkways and [[Urban open space|green spaces]] to be built, alongside amenities such as fountains and a wetlands conservation area. In addition, there will be an effective public transportation network. However, among the most pressing problems is affordable housing for the majority of the city's population, and a number of schemes are under consideration.

Most leave from the Nyabugogo bus station. These services include:\n* Modern Coast, a [[Kenya]]n coach and courier service which connects [[Gisenyi]]/[[Goma]] through [[Kyanika]] and Kigali through [[Gatuna]] to [[Kampala]] and [[Nairobi]]. It offers online booking and payment, three seat classes and in some busses personal TVs and 240 V/USB sockets.\n* Jaguar Executive Coaches, which connects Kigali to [[Kampala]], the [[Uganda]]n capital, via [[Gatuna]] or via [[Kayonza]] and [[Kagitumba]].\n* Yahoo Car Express \u2013 A minibus service running between Kigali and [[Bujumbura]] in [[Burundi]].\n* Kampala Coach Ltd, which runs services to Kampala (8 hours), Nairobi in Kenya (24 hours), Dar es Salaam in Tanzania (36 hours) and Mombasa in Kenya (32 hours).\n\nKigali is the hub of the Rwanda transport network, with 15 minutes express bus routes to all major towns in the country. There are also taxi minibus services ([[matatu]]s) leaving from Kigali, which also go through to the major towns, but some of them stop frequently along the route to pick people up or drop them off.\n\nPublic transport within Kigali is shifting from using small matatus to bigger city buses, which are connecting the most important sectors. These buses use a cash-free payment system called [[Tap&Go]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.igihe.com/news/ac-group-launches-tap-go-smart-payment-solution.html|title=AC Group launches Tap&Go smart payment solution for public transport|website=en.igihe.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}</ref> In 2017, matatus were still used to connect the more remote areas of the city. In contrast to the national express buses, these services wait to fill up before setting off from the terminus, then pick up and drop off frequently en route.\n\nKigali has many taxis (known as 'special hire' or 'taxi voiture'), which are generally painted white with an orange stripe down the side. Even more popular are motorbike taxis ('taxi moto'), which offer a service similar to a taxi, but for lower prices, typically in the range 300-1000 [[Rwanda franc|FRW]].\n\n==Future==\nUnder a master plan for 2040, Kigali will be decentralised, with business, shopping, and leisure districts, and suburbs. The plan calls for skyscrapers, arching pedestrian walkways and [[Urban open space|green spaces]] to be built, alongside amenities such as fountains and a wetlands conservation area. In addition, there will be an effective public transportation network. However, among the most pressing problems is affordable housing for the majority of the city's population, and a number of schemes are under consideration. The city's population of about 1.2 million is expected to triple by that time.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/04/kigali-plan-rwandan-city-afford-new-homes-offices | title=Kigali's future or costly fantasy?
