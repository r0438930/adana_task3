Designed by [[Joe Johnston]] for the movie ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977),{{EpIV}} she has subsequently appeared in ''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' (1978), ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), ''[[The Force Awakens]]'' (2015), ''[[The Last Jedi]]'' (2017), ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' (2018), and ''[[The Rise of Skywalker]]'' (2019). Additionally, the ''Falcon'' appears in a variety of [[Star Wars expanded to other media|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] materials, including books, comics, and games; [[James Luceno]]'s novel ''[[Millennium Falcon (novel)|Millennium Falcon]]'' focuses on the titular ship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/vault/books/10202008feature.html|title=''Millennium Falcon'' Week Begins!|date=October 20, 2008|access-date=October 21, 2008|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021221056/http://www.starwars.com/vault/books/10202008feature.html|archive-date=October 21, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It also appears in the 2014 animated film ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' in [[Lego]] form, with [[Billy Dee Williams]] and [[Anthony Daniels]] reprising their roles of [[Lando Calrissian]] and [[C-3PO]], and [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]] voicing Han Solo.\n\n''Solo: A Star Wars Story'' depicts the [[YT-1300 Light Freighter|YT-1300 Corellian light freighter]] being embodied by '''L3-37''' ([[Phoebe Waller-Bridge]]). The ship is primarily [[Pilot in command|commanded]] by smuggler [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]] and [[Alden Ehrenreich]]) and his [[Wookiee]] [[first mate]], [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew (actor)|Peter Mayhew]] and [[Joonas Suotamo]]), and was previously [[Ship-owner|owned]] by gambler con-artist [[Lando Calrissian]] ([[Billy Dee Williams]] and [[Donald Glover]]). Described as being one of the fastest vessels in the [[Star Wars canon|''Star Wars'' canon]], the ''Falcon'' looks like a worn-out junker, but despite her humble origins and shabby exterior, the ''Millennium Falcon'' has played a critical role in some of the greatest victories of the Rebel Alliance and the New Republic.\n\n==Origin and design==\nThe ship originally had a more elongated appearance, but this design's similarity to the [[Eagle Transporter]]s in ''[[Space: 1999]]'' prompted Lucas to change the ''Falcon''{{'}}s design.<ref name=\"MakingOfMF\">{{Citation|last=Star Wars|title=Conversations: Creating A Universe - Making of the Millennium Falcon|date=2015-04-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5B1Y7rU-I|access-date=2019-04-28}}</ref> The original model was modified, re-scaled, and used as [[Princess Leia]]'s ship, ''[[Tantive IV]]''.<ref name=SculptingAG>{{Cite book|last=Peterson|first=Lorne|title=Sculpting A Galaxy - Inside the Star Wars Model Shop|date=November 14, 2006|publisher=Insight Editions|location=San Rafael, CA|isbn=1-933784-03-2|pages=2\u20133}}</ref> Modelmaker [[Joe Johnston]] had about four weeks to redesign the ''Falcon'', and Lucas' only suggestion to Johnston was to \"think of a flying saucer\".<ref name=\"annotatedscreenplay-53\">{{cite book |last=Bouzereau|first=Laurent|authorlink=Laurent Bouzereau|title=Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays|date=1997|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]|isbn=0345409817|page=53}}</ref> Johnston did not want to produce a \"basic flying saucer\", so he created the offset cockpit, forward cargo mandibles, and rear slot for the engines.<ref name=\"annotatedscreenplay-53\" /> It was also said that the shape of the ship was roughly based on a hamburger with an olive-on-the-side cockpit.

For ''Star Wars'', a partial exterior set was constructed and the set dressed as Mos Eisley's Docking Bay 94 and the Death Star hangar. Besides the functional landing gear, an additional support held up the structure and was disguised as a fuel line. The interior set included the starboard ring corridor, the boarding ramp, cockpit access tunnel, gun turret ladder, secret compartments, and the forward hold. The cockpit was constructed as a separate set that could be rocked when the ship was supposed to shake. Several inconsistencies exist between the internal set and the external set, the cockpit access tunnel angle being the most noticeable.\n\nThe effects models for ''Star Wars'' matched the design of the exterior set. The primary model was five feet long and detailed with various kit parts. The ship was represented by a [[matte painting]] when [[Princess Leia]] ([[Carrie Fisher]]) sees it for the first time, showing the full upper surface. For the [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases|1997 \"Special Edition\"]], a digital model replaces the effects model in several shots, and is used in a new shot of the ''Falcon'' lifting off from Docking Bay 94.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stewart |first=Drew |title=Disney+ Should Offer the Star Wars Original Cuts\u2014All of Them |url=https://www.wired.com/story/put-original-star-wars-on-disney-plus/ |website=Wired |accessdate=1 April 2020 |date=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nFor ''The Empire Strikes Back'', a new external set was constructed.

The only major design change was to add landing gear where the disguised fuel line had been in ''Star Wars''. As this set included the port side, that gave the set seven landing gears. The internal set was slightly refitted from ''A New Hope'' and featured a sliding cockpit door, a larger cargo hold, an additional corridor to port, and an equipment room.

For the 1997 Special Edition, a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] model replaced the effects model during the approach and landing on Cloud City.\n\nNo new models or sets were created for ''Return of the Jedi''. A portion of the full-scale ship was used for a scene cut from the film in which several characters board the ''Falcon'' in a sandstorm on Tatooine. In the scene when Han exacts a promise from Lando not to damage the ''Falcon'', the ''Falcon'' is represented by a backdrop painting.

When the ''Falcon'' is captured by the Death Star, the group conceal themselves in smuggling compartments built into the floor to avoid detection during a search of the ship. Solo later collects his fee for delivering them to the hidden Rebel base and departs under bitter circumstances, but returns to assist Luke in destroying the Death Star.\n\nSolo pilots the ''Falcon'', with Chewbacca, Leia, and C-3PO aboard, to elude the Imperial Starfleet in ''The Empire Strikes Back'', wherein they take refuge at Cloud City, where [[Darth Vader]] ([[David Prowse]]/[[James Earl Jones]]) captures Solo. Lando Calrissian helps the others escape and, at the film's end, he departs in the ''Falcon'' to track down Solo and his captor, [[Jabba the Hutt]]. Calrissian again captains the ''Falcon'' during the climax of ''Return of the Jedi'', with [[Nien Nunb]] as co-pilot, to destroy the second Death Star. Before the second Death Star is destroyed, Lando accidentally damages the ship by hitting the circular sensor [[rectenna]] dish on a random pipe or circuit in the second Death Star. Lando and the others still have success in destroying the Galactic Empire.\n\nIn ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'', set some 30 years after ''Return of the Jedi'', the ''Falcon'' is in the possession of a scrap dealer named [[Unkar Plutt]] on the desert planet [[Jakku]], having been stolen from Solo and Chewbacca some years prior. Scavenger [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] ([[Daisy Ridley]]) and former stormtrooper [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]] ([[John Boyega]]) steal the ''Falcon'' in order to escape from an attack by the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]], having been targeted for having the droid [[BB-8]] in their possession. They are captured by a smuggling freighter, which turns out to be piloted by Solo and Chewbacca, who reclaim the ''Falcon''. Forced to escape in the ''Falcon'' from an ambush by parties to whom Solo is heavily in debt, Solo reluctantly agrees to help Rey and Finn return BB-8 to the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]]. After Rey is captured by the First Order, Solo agrees to take Finn in the ''Falcon'' to the First Order's new Starkiller Base\u2014a planet that has been converted into the next generation of 'Death Star'\u2014by attempting a risky maneuver of bypassing the planet's defences by exiting hyperspace in its atmosphere. When Solo is killed by his son, the rebels escape the destructing Starkiller Base. Later, Rey uses a newly-assembled map to travel to Ahch-To, the site of the first Jedi temple, to make contact with the long-lost Luke Skywalker, travelling in the ''Falcon'' in the company of Chewbacca and R2-D2.\n\nThe ''Falcon'' appears again in ''Star Wars: The Last Jedi'', still on Ahch-To with [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] and [[Chewbacca]]. Later in the film, Chewbacca and Rey take the ''Falcon'' to the planet Crait, where the Resistance is under attack by the First Order. The ''Falcon'' loses its sensor dish for the third time on Crait, after it is shot off by a TIE fighter, but still manages to single-handedly take out most of the First Order's fighters on the planet while Luke distracts Kylo Ren. After the battle, surviving Resistance personnel leave Crait aboard the ''Falcon''.\n\nIn ''The Last Jedi'', Rey uses the ''Falcon''{{'}}s [[escape pod]] to board [[Supreme Leader Snoke]]'s ship.

Solo has to make many calculated jumps to avoid killing the crew. After integrating the memory module of Lando's damaged L3 droid into the ship's navigation, Solo is able to take a \"shortcut\"<ref name=sr/> (which is dangerously close to a [[black hole]]). Chewbacca indicates the real distance was closer to 13 parsecs, but Solo insists, \"Not if you round down,\" implying that the claim of \"less than twelve parsecs\" is slightly exaggerated.\n\n===Ownership===\nThe ''Falcon'' has been depicted many times in the franchise, and its ownership and command have changed several times.\n* Prior to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', the ''Falcon'' was in the possession of Lando Calrissian. He lost it to Han Solo in payment of a gambling debt.

The ship is primarily [[Pilot in command|commanded]] by smuggler [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]] and [[Alden Ehrenreich]]) and his [[Wookiee]] [[first mate]], [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew (actor)|Peter Mayhew]] and [[Joonas Suotamo]]), and was previously [[Ship-owner|owned]] by gambler con-artist [[Lando Calrissian]] ([[Billy Dee Williams]] and [[Donald Glover]]). Described as being one of the fastest vessels in the [[Star Wars canon|''Star Wars'' canon]], the ''Falcon'' looks like a worn-out junker, but despite her humble origins and shabby exterior, the ''Millennium Falcon'' has played a critical role in some of the greatest victories of the Rebel Alliance and the New Republic.\n\n==Origin and design==\nThe ship originally had a more elongated appearance, but this design's similarity to the [[Eagle Transporter]]s in ''[[Space: 1999]]'' prompted Lucas to change the ''Falcon''{{'}}s design.<ref name=\"MakingOfMF\">{{Citation|last=Star Wars|title=Conversations: Creating A Universe - Making of the Millennium Falcon|date=2015-04-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5B1Y7rU-I|access-date=2019-04-28}}</ref> The original model was modified, re-scaled, and used as [[Princess Leia]]'s ship, ''[[Tantive IV]]''.<ref name=SculptingAG>{{Cite book|last=Peterson|first=Lorne|title=Sculpting A Galaxy - Inside the Star Wars Model Shop|date=November 14, 2006|publisher=Insight Editions|location=San Rafael, CA|isbn=1-933784-03-2|pages=2\u20133}}</ref> Modelmaker [[Joe Johnston]] had about four weeks to redesign the ''Falcon'', and Lucas' only suggestion to Johnston was to \"think of a flying saucer\".<ref name=\"annotatedscreenplay-53\">{{cite book |last=Bouzereau|first=Laurent|authorlink=Laurent Bouzereau|title=Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays|date=1997|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]|isbn=0345409817|page=53}}</ref> Johnston did not want to produce a \"basic flying saucer\", so he created the offset cockpit, forward cargo mandibles, and rear slot for the engines.<ref name=\"annotatedscreenplay-53\" /> It was also said that the shape of the ship was roughly based on a hamburger with an olive-on-the-side cockpit.

For ''Star Wars'', a partial exterior set was constructed and the set dressed as Mos Eisley's Docking Bay 94 and the Death Star hangar. Besides the functional landing gear, an additional support held up the structure and was disguised as a fuel line. The interior set included the starboard ring corridor, the boarding ramp, cockpit access tunnel, gun turret ladder, secret compartments, and the forward hold. The cockpit was constructed as a separate set that could be rocked when the ship was supposed to shake. Several inconsistencies exist between the internal set and the external set, the cockpit access tunnel angle being the most noticeable.\n\nThe effects models for ''Star Wars'' matched the design of the exterior set. The primary model was five feet long and detailed with various kit parts. The ship was represented by a [[matte painting]] when [[Princess Leia]] ([[Carrie Fisher]]) sees it for the first time, showing the full upper surface. For the [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases|1997 \"Special Edition\"]], a digital model replaces the effects model in several shots, and is used in a new shot of the ''Falcon'' lifting off from Docking Bay 94.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stewart |first=Drew |title=Disney+ Should Offer the Star Wars Original Cuts\u2014All of Them |url=https://www.wired.com/story/put-original-star-wars-on-disney-plus/ |website=Wired |accessdate=1 April 2020 |date=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nFor ''The Empire Strikes Back'', a new external set was constructed.

The 32\" model was the version of the ''Millennium Falcon'' most depicted in toys, model kits, and promotional materials for the ''Star Wars'' universe prior to the release of ''The Force Awakens''.

The only major design change was to add landing gear where the disguised fuel line had been in ''Star Wars''. As this set included the port side, that gave the set seven landing gears. The internal set was slightly refitted from ''A New Hope'' and featured a sliding cockpit door, a larger cargo hold, an additional corridor to port, and an equipment room.

For the 1997 Special Edition, a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] model replaced the effects model during the approach and landing on Cloud City.\n\nNo new models or sets were created for ''Return of the Jedi''. A portion of the full-scale ship was used for a scene cut from the film in which several characters board the ''Falcon'' in a sandstorm on Tatooine. In the scene when Han exacts a promise from Lando not to damage the ''Falcon'', the ''Falcon'' is represented by a backdrop painting.

When the ''Falcon'' is captured by the Death Star, the group conceal themselves in smuggling compartments built into the floor to avoid detection during a search of the ship. Solo later collects his fee for delivering them to the hidden Rebel base and departs under bitter circumstances, but returns to assist Luke in destroying the Death Star.\n\nSolo pilots the ''Falcon'', with Chewbacca, Leia, and C-3PO aboard, to elude the Imperial Starfleet in ''The Empire Strikes Back'', wherein they take refuge at Cloud City, where [[Darth Vader]] ([[David Prowse]]/[[James Earl Jones]]) captures Solo. Lando Calrissian helps the others escape and, at the film's end, he departs in the ''Falcon'' to track down Solo and his captor, [[Jabba the Hutt]]. Calrissian again captains the ''Falcon'' during the climax of ''Return of the Jedi'', with [[Nien Nunb]] as co-pilot, to destroy the second Death Star. Before the second Death Star is destroyed, Lando accidentally damages the ship by hitting the circular sensor [[rectenna]] dish on a random pipe or circuit in the second Death Star. Lando and the others still have success in destroying the Galactic Empire.\n\nIn ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'', set some 30 years after ''Return of the Jedi'', the ''Falcon'' is in the possession of a scrap dealer named [[Unkar Plutt]] on the desert planet [[Jakku]], having been stolen from Solo and Chewbacca some years prior. Scavenger [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] ([[Daisy Ridley]]) and former stormtrooper [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]] ([[John Boyega]]) steal the ''Falcon'' in order to escape from an attack by the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]], having been targeted for having the droid [[BB-8]] in their possession. They are captured by a smuggling freighter, which turns out to be piloted by Solo and Chewbacca, who reclaim the ''Falcon''. Forced to escape in the ''Falcon'' from an ambush by parties to whom Solo is heavily in debt, Solo reluctantly agrees to help Rey and Finn return BB-8 to the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]]. After Rey is captured by the First Order, Solo agrees to take Finn in the ''Falcon'' to the First Order's new Starkiller Base\u2014a planet that has been converted into the next generation of 'Death Star'\u2014by attempting a risky maneuver of bypassing the planet's defences by exiting hyperspace in its atmosphere. When Solo is killed by his son, the rebels escape the destructing Starkiller Base. Later, Rey uses a newly-assembled map to travel to Ahch-To, the site of the first Jedi temple, to make contact with the long-lost Luke Skywalker, travelling in the ''Falcon'' in the company of Chewbacca and R2-D2.\n\nThe ''Falcon'' appears again in ''Star Wars: The Last Jedi'', still on Ahch-To with [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] and [[Chewbacca]]. Later in the film, Chewbacca and Rey take the ''Falcon'' to the planet Crait, where the Resistance is under attack by the First Order. The ''Falcon'' loses its sensor dish for the third time on Crait, after it is shot off by a TIE fighter, but still manages to single-handedly take out most of the First Order's fighters on the planet while Luke distracts Kylo Ren. After the battle, surviving Resistance personnel leave Crait aboard the ''Falcon''.\n\nIn ''The Last Jedi'', Rey uses the ''Falcon''{{'}}s [[escape pod]] to board [[Supreme Leader Snoke]]'s ship. Director [[Rian Johnson]] noted that he wanted its design to resemble a coffin, inspired by [[C.S. Lewis]]' ''[[Perelandra]]''.

Solo has to make many calculated jumps to avoid killing the crew. After integrating the memory module of Lando's damaged L3 droid into the ship's navigation, Solo is able to take a \"shortcut\"<ref name=sr/> (which is dangerously close to a [[black hole]]). Chewbacca indicates the real distance was closer to 13 parsecs, but Solo insists, \"Not if you round down,\" implying that the claim of \"less than twelve parsecs\" is slightly exaggerated.\n\n===Ownership===\nThe ''Falcon'' has been depicted many times in the franchise, and its ownership and command have changed several times.\n* Prior to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', the ''Falcon'' was in the possession of Lando Calrissian. He lost it to Han Solo in payment of a gambling debt.  This is depicted in ''Solo: A Star Wars Story'', as well as the integration of Lando's droid '''L3-37''' with the ship's computer.\n* After the events of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Leia, Chewbacca and Lando take possession of the ''Falcon'' after Solo's hibernation in carbonite and capture by the Empire and [[Boba Fett]].\n* During ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', Solo leaves Tatooine aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', and on arrival at the rendezvous for the Rebel fleet he lends the ''Falcon'' to Calrissian, who pilots it during the Battle of Endor and the destruction of the second [[Death Star]].\n* After the events of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', the ''Falcon'' is stolen from Solo, ending up on the planet Jakku under the ownership of a scrap dealer, [[Unkar Plutt]], 30 years after the Battle of Endor. In ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'', Rey and Finn commandeer the ship to escape the planet, only to be found by Solo and Chewbacca, who immediately reclaim the ship.\n* After the death of Solo, Rey pilots the ''Falcon'', with Chewbacca as her co-pilot. The novelization of ''The Force Awakens'' states that Chewbacca willingly abdicates captaincy of the ''Falcon'' to Rey.\n* After the events of ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'', the ship becomes the [[Headquarters|base of operation]]s for the remaining members of the Resistance.\n* After the events of ''[[The Rise of Skywalker]]'' the Falcon is again under Lando Calrissian with [[Chewbacca]].\n\n==Cultural influence==\n[[Joss Whedon]] credits the ''Millennium Falcon'' as one of his two primary inspirations for his ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' television show.<ref name=\"whedon\">{{cite video|people=[[Joss Whedon]]|title=What's in a Firefly|date=2005}}</ref> The ''Falcon'' and the ''Falcon''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s distinct shape appear in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]],''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/594/594096p3.html|title=Star Trek: First Contact - Special Collector's Edition|first=Andy|last=Patrizio|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=October 31, 2008}}</ref> ''[[Blade Runner]]'',<ref>{{Cite book|title=Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner|first=Paul M.|last=Sammon|date=June 1, 1996|isbn=978-0-06-105314-6|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|pages=251|quote=Bill George had been making a replica of the ''Millennium Falcon'' [ . . . ] we were so frantic to get more buildings into the cityscape that we grabbed Bill's ship, bristled it with etched brass, and plopped it into different shots.
