It opened to traffic on July 1, 1940, and dramatically [[structural failure|collapsed]] into Puget Sound on November{{nbsp}}7 the same year. The bridge's collapse has been described as \"spectacular\" and in subsequent decades \"has attracted the attention of engineers, physicists, and mathematicians\".<ref>Gianni Arioli and Filippo Gazzola.

Applied Mathematical Modelling, Jan 2015. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2014.06.022</ref> Throughout its short existence, it was the world's third-longest suspension bridge by main span, behind the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and the [[George Washington Bridge]].\n\nConstruction began in September 1938. From the time the [[deck (bridge)|deck]] was built, it began to move vertically in windy conditions, so construction workers nicknamed the bridge '''Galloping Gertie'''. The motion continued after the bridge opened to the public, despite several damping measures. The bridge's main span finally collapsed in {{convert|40|mph|km/h|adj=on}} winds on the morning of November 7, 1940, as the deck oscillated in an alternating twisting motion that gradually increased in amplitude until the deck tore apart.\n\nThe portions of the bridge still standing after the collapse, including the towers and cables, were dismantled and sold as scrap metal. Efforts to replace the bridge were delayed by the United States' entry into [[World War II]], but in 1950, a [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1950)|new Tacoma Narrows Bridge]] opened in the same location, using the original bridge's tower pedestals and cable anchorages. The portion of the bridge that fell into the water now serves as an [[artificial reef]].\n\nThe bridge's collapse had a lasting effect on science and engineering. In many [[physics]] textbooks, the event is presented as an example of elementary forced [[Mechanical resonance|resonance]], but that is incorrect: the bridge collapsed because moderate winds produced [[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic flutter]] that was self-exciting and unbounded: for any constant sustained wind speed above about {{cvt|35|mph|km/h|||}}, the amplitude of the ([[torsion]]al) flutter oscillation would continuously increase, with a negative [[damping]] factor (i.e. a reinforcing effect, opposite to damping).<ref name=\"BillahScanlan91\"/> The collapse boosted research into bridge aerodynamics-aeroelastics, which has influenced the designs of all later long-span bridges.\n\n==Design and construction==\n{{refimprove section|date = April 2015}}\nThe desire for the construction of a bridge between Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula dates back to 1889 with a [[Northern Pacific Railway]] proposal for a [[trestle]], but concerted efforts began in the mid-1920s. The Tacoma [[Chamber of Commerce]] began campaigning and funding studies in 1923.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Tacoma Narrows Bridges|last = Petroski|first = Henry|date = 2009|journal =[[American Scientist]]|doi = 10.1511/2009.77.103|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 97|issue = 2|edition = 2|issn = 0003-0996|pages = 103\u2013107}}</ref> Several noted bridge engineers, including [[Joseph Strauss (engineer)|Joseph B. Strauss]], who went on to be chief engineer of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], and [[David B. Steinman]], who went on to design the [[Mackinac Bridge]], were consulted. Steinman made several Chamber-funded visits, culminating in a preliminary proposal presented in 1929, but by 1931, the Chamber decided to cancel the agreement on the grounds that Steinman was not sufficiently active in working to obtain financing. Another problem with financing the first bridge was buying out the ferry contract from a private firm running services on the Narrows at the time.\n\nThe Washington State legislature created the [[Washington Toll Bridge Authority|Washington State Toll Bridge Authority]] and appropriated $5,000 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|5000|1931|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) to study the request by Tacoma and [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]] for a bridge over the Narrows.<ref>Plaut, R.H. (2008). \"Snap Loads and Torsional Oscillation of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge\". ''[[Journal of Sound and Vibration]]. doi: 10.1016/j.jsv.2007.07.057''</ref>\n\nFrom the start, financing of the bridge was a problem: revenue from the proposed tolls would not be enough to cover construction costs, but there was strong support for the bridge from the [[U.S. Navy]], which operated the [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], and from the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], which ran [[McChord Air Force Base|McChord Field]] and [[Fort Lewis]] near Tacoma.\n\nWashington State engineer [[Clark Eldridge]] <!-- state employee, not just resident in the state --> produced a preliminary tried-and-true conventional suspension bridge design, and the [[Washington Toll Bridge Authority]] requested $11 million (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|11|1931|r=0|fmt=c}} million today) from the Federal [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA). Preliminary construction plans by the Washington Department of Highways had called for a set of {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} [[trusses]] to sit beneath the roadway and stiffen it.\n\nHowever, according to Eldridge, \"Eastern consulting engineers\"\u2014by which Eldridge meant [[Leon Moisseiff]], the noted New York bridge engineer who served as designer and consultant engineer for the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]\u2014petitioned the PWA and the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC) to build the bridge for less. Moisseiff and Frederick Lienhard, the latter an engineer with what was then known as the [[Port of New York Authority]], had published a paper<ref>Leon S. Moisseiff and Frederick Lienhard. \"Suspension Bridges Under the Action of Lateral Forces,\" with discussion. ''Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers'', No. 98, 1933, pp. 1080\u20131095, 1096\u20131141</ref> that was probably the most important theoretical advance in the bridge engineering field of the decade.<ref name=\"RichardScott\">Richard Scott. In the Wake of Tacoma: Suspension Bridges and the Quest for Aerodynamic Stability. ''American Society of Civil Engineers'' (June 1, 2001) {{ISBN|0-7844-0542-5}}  https://books.google.com/books?id=DnQOzYDJsm8C</ref> Their theory of elastic distribution extended the [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]] theory that was originally devised by the Austrian engineer [[Josef Melan]] to horizontal bending under static wind load. They showed that the stiffness of the main cables (via the suspenders) would absorb up to one-half of the static wind pressure pushing a suspended structure laterally. This energy would then be transmitted to the anchorages and towers.<ref name=\"RichardScott\"/> Using this theory, Moisseiff argued for stiffening the bridge with a set of {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|spell=in|-deep}} plate girders rather than the {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep|}} trusses proposed by the Washington Toll Bridge Authority. This approach meant a slimmer, more elegant design, and also reduced the construction costs as compared with the Highway Department's design proposed by Eldridge. Moisseiff's design won out, inasmuch as the other proposal was considered to be too expensive. On June 23, 1938, the PWA approved nearly $6 million (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|6|1938|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) for the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Another $1.6 million (${{inflation|US|1.6|1938|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) was to be collected from tolls to cover the estimated total $8<!-- ibid --> million cost (${{inflation|US|8|1938|r=1|fmt=c}} million today).\n[[File:Tacoma Narrows Bridge opening program June 30, 1940.jpg|thumb|left|Program for the opening of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, June 30, 1940]]\nFollowing Moisseiff's design, bridge construction began on September 27, 1938. Construction took only nineteen months, at a cost of $6.4 million (${{inflation|US|6.4|1938|r=1|fmt=c}} million today), which was financed by the grant from the PWA and a loan from the RFC.\n\nThe Tacoma Narrows Bridge, with a main span of {{convert|2800|ft}}, was the third-longest suspension bridge in the world at that time, following the [[George Washington Bridge]] between [[New Jersey]] and [[New York City]], and the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], connecting [[San Francisco]] with [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to its north.<ref>Henry Petroski. Engineers of Dreams: Great Bridge Builders and the Spanning of America. New York: [[Knopf]]/[[Random House]], 1995.</ref>\n\nBecause planners expected fairly light traffic volumes, the bridge was designed with two lanes, and it was just {{convert|39|ft}} wide. This was quite narrow, especially in comparison with its length. With only the {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} plate girders providing additional depth, the bridge's roadway section was also shallow.\n\nThe decision to use such shallow and narrow girders proved to be the original Tacoma Narrows  Bridge's undoing. With such minimal girders, the deck of the bridge was insufficiently rigid and was easily moved about by winds; from the start, the bridge became infamous for its movement. A mild to moderate wind could cause alternate halves of the center [[span (architecture)|span]] to visibly rise and fall several feet over four- to five-second intervals. This flexibility was experienced by the builders and workmen during construction, which led some of the workers to christen the bridge  \"Galloping Gertie\". The nickname soon stuck, and even the public (when the [[toll bridge|toll]]-paid traffic started) felt these motions on the day that the bridge opened on July 1, 1940.\n\n==Attempt to control structural vibration==\nSince the structure experienced considerable vertical [[oscillations]] while it was still under construction, several strategies were used to reduce the motion of the bridge. They included<ref>Rita Robison. \"Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse.\" In ''When Technology Fails'', edited by Neil Schlager, pp. 18\u2013190. Detroit: [[Gale Research]], 1994.</ref>\n* attachment of tie-down cables to the plate girders, which were anchored to 50-ton [[concrete]] blocks on the shore. This measure proved ineffective, as the cables snapped shortly after installation.\n* addition of a pair of inclined [[Cable-stayed bridge|cable stays]] that connected the main cables to the bridge deck at mid-span. These remained in place until the collapse, but were also ineffective at reducing the oscillations.\n* finally, the structure was equipped with hydraulic buffers installed between the towers and the floor system of the deck to [[damping|damp]] longitudinal motion of the main span. The effectiveness of the hydraulic dampers was nullified, however, because the seals of the units were damaged when the bridge was sand-blasted before being painted.\n\nThe [[Washington Toll Bridge Authority]] hired Professor Frederick Burt Farquharson, an engineering professor at the [[University of Washington]], to make [[wind-tunnel]] tests and recommend solutions in order to reduce the oscillations of the bridge. Professor Farquharson and his students built a 1:200-scale model of the bridge and a 1:20-scale model of a section of the deck. The first studies concluded on November 2, 1940\u2014five days before the bridge collapse on November 7. He proposed two solutions:\n* To drill holes in the lateral girders and along the deck so that the air flow could circulate through them (in this way reducing [[lift (force)|lift forces]]).\n* To give a more [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] shape to the transverse section of the deck by adding fairings or deflector vanes along the deck, attached to the girder fascia.\nThe first option was not favored because of its irreversible nature. The second option was the chosen one, but it was not carried out, because the bridge collapsed five days after the studies were concluded.<ref name=\"RichardScott\"/>\n\n==Collapse==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TacomaNarrowsBridgeCollapse in color.jpg|thumb|The bridge collapsing, in a frame from a 16 mm Kodachrome motion picture film taken by Barney Elliott]] -->\nThe wind-induced collapse occurred on November 7, 1940, at approximately 11:00&nbsp;a.m. (PST), and was caused by a physical phenomenon known as [[aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic flutter]].<ref name=\"BillahScanlan91\"/>\n\nLeonard Coatsworth, a ''[[Tacoma News Tribune]]'' editor, was the last person to drive on the bridge:\n\n{{quote|Around me I could hear concrete cracking.

It included [[Othmar Ammann]] and [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]]. Without drawing any definitive conclusions, the commission explored three possible failure causes:\n* Aerodynamic instability by self-induced vibrations in the structure\n* Eddy formations that might be periodic in nature\n* Random effects of turbulence, that is the random fluctuations in velocity of the wind.\n\n===Cause of the collapse===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nThe original Tacoma Narrows Bridge was the first to be built with girders of carbon [[steel]] anchored in concrete blocks; preceding designs typically had open lattice beam trusses underneath the roadbed. This bridge was the first of its type to employ plate girders (pairs of deep [[I-beam]]s) to support the roadbed. With the earlier designs, any wind would simply pass through the truss, but in the new design the wind would be diverted above and below the structure. Shortly after construction finished at the end of June (opened to traffic on July 1, 1940), it was discovered that the bridge would sway and [[buckling|buckle]] dangerously in relatively mild windy conditions that are common for the area, and worse during severe winds. This vibration was [[transverse wave|transverse]], one-half of the central span rising while the other lowered. Drivers would see cars approaching from the other direction rise and fall, riding the violent energy wave through the bridge. However, at that time the mass of the bridge was considered to be sufficient to keep it structurally sound.\n\nThe failure of the bridge occurred when a never-before-seen twisting mode occurred, from winds at {{convert|40|mph}}. This is a so-called torsional [[vibration mode]] (which is different from the [[transverse mode|transversal]] or [[longitudinal mode|longitudinal]] vibration mode), whereby when the left side of the roadway went down, the right side would rise, and vice versa (i.e., the two halves of the bridge twisted in opposite directions), with the center line of the road remaining still (motionless). This vibration was caused by [[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic fluttering]].\n\n[[File:Tacoma Bridge Animation.ogv|thumb|Full-scale, two-way Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) model of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge exhibiting aeroelastic flutter]] Fluttering is a physical phenomenon in which several [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] of a structure become coupled in an unstable oscillation driven by the wind. Here, unstable means that the forces and effects that cause the oscillation are not checked by forces and effects that limit the oscillation, so it does not self-limit but grows without bound.  Eventually, the amplitude of the motion produced by the fluttering increased beyond the strength of a vital part, in this case the suspender cables.  As several cables failed, the weight of the deck transferred to the adjacent cables, which became overloaded and broke in turn until almost all of the central deck fell into the water below the span.\n\n====Resonance (due to Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street) hypothesis====\n[[Image:Vortex-street-animation.gif|thumb|right|Vortex shedding and [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]] behind a circular cylinder.

Resonance is the tendency of a system to oscillate at larger amplitudes at certain frequencies, known as the system's natural frequencies. At these frequencies, even relatively small periodic driving forces can produce large amplitude vibrations, because the system stores energy. For example, a child using a swing realizes that if the pushes are properly timed, the swing can move with a very large amplitude. The driving force, in this case the child pushing the swing, exactly replenishes the energy that the system loses if its frequency equals the natural frequency of the system.\n\nUsually, the approach taken by those physics textbooks is to introduce a first order  forced oscillator, defined by the [[second-order differential equation]]\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>m\\ddot{x}(t) + c\\dot{x}(t) + kx(t) = F \\cos (\\omega t)</math>  |{{EquationRef|eq. 1}}}}\n\nwhere {{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|k}} stand for the [[mass]], [[damping coefficient]] and [[stiffness]] of the [[linear system]] and {{mvar|F}} and {{mvar|\u03c9}} represent the amplitude and the [[angular frequency]] of the exciting force.  The solution of such [[ordinary differential equation]] as a function of time {{mvar|t}} represents the displacement response of the system (given appropriate initial conditions). In the above system resonance happens when {{mvar|\u03c9}} is approximately <math>\\omega_r = \\sqrt{k/m}</math>, i.e. <math>\\omega_r</math> is the natural (resonant) frequency of the system. The actual vibration analysis of a more complicated mechanical system\u2014such as an airplane, a building or a bridge\u2014is based on the linearization of the equation of motion for the system, which is a multidimensional version of equation ({{EquationNote|eq. 1}}). The analysis requires [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] analysis and thereafter the natural frequencies of the structure are found, together with the so-called ''fundamental modes'' of the system, which are a set of independent displacements and/or rotations that specify completely the displaced or deformed position and orientation of the body or system, i.e., the bridge moves as a (linear) combination of those basic deformed positions.\n\nEach structure has natural frequencies.  For resonance to occur, it is necessary to have also periodicity in the excitation force. The most tempting candidate of the periodicity in the wind force was assumed to be the so-called [[vortex shedding]]. This is because bluff bodies (non-streamlined bodies), like bridge decks, in a fluid stream shed [[wake]]s, whose characteristics depend on the size and shape of the body and the properties of the fluid. These wakes are accompanied by alternating low-pressure vortices on the downwind side of the body (the so-called [[Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]]). The body will in consequence try to move toward the low-pressure zone, in an oscillating movement called [[vortex induced vibration|vortex-induced vibration]]. Eventually, if the frequency of vortex shedding matches the natural frequency of the structure, the structure will begin to resonate and the structure's movement can become self-sustaining.\n\nThe frequency of the vortices in the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street is called the Strouhal frequency <math>f_s</math>, and is given by\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\frac{f_s D}{U} = S</math>  |{{EquationRef|eq. 2}}}}\nHere, {{mvar|U}} stands for the flow velocity, {{mvar|D}} is a characteristic length of the bluff body and {{mvar|S}} is the dimensionless [[Strouhal number]], which depends on the body in question. For [[Reynolds Number]]s greater than 1000, the Strouhal number is approximately equal to 0.21. In the case of the Tacoma Narrows, {{mvar|D}}&nbsp; was approximately {{convert|8|ft}} and {{mvar|S}} was 0.20.\n\nIt was thought that the Strouhal frequency was close enough to one of the natural vibration frequencies of the bridge i.e. <math>2\\pi f_s = \\omega</math>, to cause resonance and therefore [[vortex induced vibration|vortex-induced vibration]].\n\nIn the case of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, this appears not to have been the cause of the catastrophic damage. According to Professor Frederick Burt Farquharson, an engineering professor at the University of Washington and one of the main researchers into the cause of the bridge collapse, the wind was steady at {{convert|42|mph}} and the frequency of the destructive mode was 12 cycles/minute (0.2 [[Hertz|Hz]]).<ref>F. B. Farquharson et al. Aerodynamic stability of suspension bridges with special reference to the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. University of Washington Engineering Experimental Station, Seattle. Bulletin 116. Parts I to V. A series of reports issued since June 1949 to June 1954.</ref> This frequency was neither a natural mode of the isolated structure nor the frequency of blunt-body [[vortex shedding]] of the bridge at that wind speed (which was approximately 1&nbsp;Hz). It can be concluded therefore that the vortex shedding was not the cause of the bridge collapse. The event can be understood only while considering the coupled aerodynamic and structural system that requires rigorous mathematical analysis to reveal all the degrees of freedom of the particular structure and the set of design loads imposed.\n\nVortex-induced vibration is a far more complex process that involves both the external wind-initiated forces and internal self-excited forces that lock on to the motion of the structure. During lock-on, the wind forces drive the structure at or near one of its natural frequencies, but as the amplitude increases this has the effect of changing the local fluid boundary conditions, so that this induces compensating, self-limiting forces, which restrict the motion to relatively benign amplitudes. This is clearly not a linear resonance phenomenon, even if the bluff body has itself linear behaviour, since the exciting force amplitude is a nonlinear force of the structural response.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Billah, K.Y.R. and Scanlan, R.H. \"Vortex-Induced Vibration and its Mathematical Modeling: A Bibliography\", Report No. SM-89-1.

Yusuf Billah and Robert Scanlan. According to the two engineers, the failure of the bridge was related to a wind-driven amplification of the torsional oscillation that, unlike a resonance, increases monotonically with increasing wind speed. The fluid dynamics behind that amplification is complicated, but one key element, as described by physicists Daniel Green and William Unruh, is the creation of large-scale vortices above and below the roadway, or deck, of the bridge. Nowadays, bridges are constructed to be rigid and to have mechanisms that damp oscillations. Sometimes they include a slot in the middle of the deck to alleviate pressure differences above and below the road.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = The Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse|journal =[[Physics Today]]|date = 2015-11-01|issn = 0031-9228|pages = 64\u201365|volume = 68|issue = 11|doi = 10.1063/PT.3.2991|first = Donald W.|last = Olson|first2 = Steven F.|last2 = Wolf|first3 = Joseph M.|last3 = Hook|bibcode = 2015PhT....68k..64O |doi-access = free}}</ref> }}\n\nTo some degree the debate is due to the lack of a commonly accepted precise definition of resonance.

It would appear not to contradict the qualitative definition of resonance quoted earlier, if we now identify the source of the periodic impulses as ''self-induced'', the wind supplying the power, and the motion supplying the power-tapping mechanism.

Fourteen-foot-high (4.3 m) steel trusses were installed on both sides of the deck in 1943 to weigh down and stiffen the bridge in an effort to reduce oscillation. In 2003, the stiffening trusses were removed and aerodynamic fiberglass fairings were installed along both sides of the road deck.\n\nA key consequence was that suspension bridges reverted to a deeper and heavier [[truss]] design, including the replacement [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1950)]], until the development in the 1960s of [[box girder bridges]] with an [[aerofoil]] shape such as the [[Severn Bridge]], which gave the necessary stiffness together with reduced torsional forces.\n\n== Replacement bridge ==\n{{Main|Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1950)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge}}\nBecause of shortages in materials and labor as a result of the involvement of the United States in World War II, it took 10 years before a replacement bridge was opened to traffic.

The replacement bridge also has more lanes than the original bridge, which only had two traffic lanes, plus shoulders on both sides.\n\nHalf a century later, the replacement bridge had exceeded its traffic capacity, and a second, parallel suspension bridge was constructed to carry eastbound traffic. The suspension bridge that was completed in 1950 was reconfigured to carry only westbound traffic. The new parallel bridge opened to traffic in July 2007.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of bridge disasters]]\n* [[List of structural failures and collapses]]\n* [[Engineering disasters]]\n* [[Millennium Bridge, London]], for an engineering error\n* [[Silver Bridge]]\n* [[Volgograd Bridge]], a bridge in Russia which experienced similar problems with the wind\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [https://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-myth-of-galloping-gertie \"The Strangest, Most Spectacular Bridge Collapse (And How We Got It Wrong)\"] (December 2015).

It opened to traffic on July 1, 1940, and dramatically [[structural failure|collapsed]] into Puget Sound on November{{nbsp}}7 the same year.

From the time the [[deck (bridge)|deck]] was built, it began to move vertically in windy conditions, so construction workers nicknamed the bridge '''Galloping Gertie'''. The motion continued after the bridge opened to the public, despite several damping measures. The bridge's main span finally collapsed in {{convert|40|mph|km/h|adj=on}} winds on the morning of November 7, 1940, as the deck oscillated in an alternating twisting motion that gradually increased in amplitude until the deck tore apart.\n\nThe portions of the bridge still standing after the collapse, including the towers and cables, were dismantled and sold as scrap metal. Efforts to replace the bridge were delayed by the United States' entry into [[World War II]], but in 1950, a [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1950)|new Tacoma Narrows Bridge]] opened in the same location, using the original bridge's tower pedestals and cable anchorages. The portion of the bridge that fell into the water now serves as an [[artificial reef]].\n\nThe bridge's collapse had a lasting effect on science and engineering. In many [[physics]] textbooks, the event is presented as an example of elementary forced [[Mechanical resonance|resonance]], but that is incorrect: the bridge collapsed because moderate winds produced [[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic flutter]] that was self-exciting and unbounded: for any constant sustained wind speed above about {{cvt|35|mph|km/h|||}}, the amplitude of the ([[torsion]]al) flutter oscillation would continuously increase, with a negative [[damping]] factor (i.e. a reinforcing effect, opposite to damping).<ref name=\"BillahScanlan91\"/> The collapse boosted research into bridge aerodynamics-aeroelastics, which has influenced the designs of all later long-span bridges.\n\n==Design and construction==\n{{refimprove section|date = April 2015}}\nThe desire for the construction of a bridge between Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula dates back to 1889 with a [[Northern Pacific Railway]] proposal for a [[trestle]], but concerted efforts began in the mid-1920s.

Steinman made several Chamber-funded visits, culminating in a preliminary proposal presented in 1929, but by 1931, the Chamber decided to cancel the agreement on the grounds that Steinman was not sufficiently active in working to obtain financing. Another problem with financing the first bridge was buying out the ferry contract from a private firm running services on the Narrows at the time.\n\nThe Washington State legislature created the [[Washington Toll Bridge Authority|Washington State Toll Bridge Authority]] and appropriated $5,000 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|5000|1931|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) to study the request by Tacoma and [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]] for a bridge over the Narrows.<ref>Plaut, R.H.

They showed that the stiffness of the main cables (via the suspenders) would absorb up to one-half of the static wind pressure pushing a suspended structure laterally. This energy would then be transmitted to the anchorages and towers.<ref name=\"RichardScott\"/> Using this theory, Moisseiff argued for stiffening the bridge with a set of {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|spell=in|-deep}} plate girders rather than the {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep|}} trusses proposed by the Washington Toll Bridge Authority. This approach meant a slimmer, more elegant design, and also reduced the construction costs as compared with the Highway Department's design proposed by Eldridge. Moisseiff's design won out, inasmuch as the other proposal was considered to be too expensive. On June 23, 1938, the PWA approved nearly $6 million (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|6|1938|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) for the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Another $1.6 million (${{inflation|US|1.6|1938|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) was to be collected from tolls to cover the estimated total $8<!-- ibid --> million cost (${{inflation|US|8|1938|r=1|fmt=c}} million today).\n[[File:Tacoma Narrows Bridge opening program June 30, 1940.jpg|thumb|left|Program for the opening of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, June 30, 1940]]\nFollowing Moisseiff's design, bridge construction began on September 27, 1938. Construction took only nineteen months, at a cost of $6.4 million (${{inflation|US|6.4|1938|r=1|fmt=c}} million today), which was financed by the grant from the PWA and a loan from the RFC.\n\nThe Tacoma Narrows Bridge, with a main span of {{convert|2800|ft}}, was the third-longest suspension bridge in the world at that time, following the [[George Washington Bridge]] between [[New Jersey]] and [[New York City]], and the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], connecting [[San Francisco]] with [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to its north.<ref>Henry Petroski.

This was quite narrow, especially in comparison with its length. With only the {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} plate girders providing additional depth, the bridge's roadway section was also shallow.\n\nThe decision to use such shallow and narrow girders proved to be the original Tacoma Narrows  Bridge's undoing. With such minimal girders, the deck of the bridge was insufficiently rigid and was easily moved about by winds; from the start, the bridge became infamous for its movement. A mild to moderate wind could cause alternate halves of the center [[span (architecture)|span]] to visibly rise and fall several feet over four- to five-second intervals. This flexibility was experienced by the builders and workmen during construction, which led some of the workers to christen the bridge  \"Galloping Gertie\". The nickname soon stuck, and even the public (when the [[toll bridge|toll]]-paid traffic started) felt these motions on the day that the bridge opened on July 1, 1940.\n\n==Attempt to control structural vibration==\nSince the structure experienced considerable vertical [[oscillations]] while it was still under construction, several strategies were used to reduce the motion of the bridge. They included<ref>Rita Robison. \"Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse.\" In ''When Technology Fails'', edited by Neil Schlager, pp. 18\u2013190. Detroit: [[Gale Research]], 1994.</ref>\n* attachment of tie-down cables to the plate girders, which were anchored to 50-ton [[concrete]] blocks on the shore. This measure proved ineffective, as the cables snapped shortly after installation.\n* addition of a pair of inclined [[Cable-stayed bridge|cable stays]] that connected the main cables to the bridge deck at mid-span. These remained in place until the collapse, but were also ineffective at reducing the oscillations.\n* finally, the structure was equipped with hydraulic buffers installed between the towers and the floor system of the deck to [[damping|damp]] longitudinal motion of the main span. The effectiveness of the hydraulic dampers was nullified, however, because the seals of the units were damaged when the bridge was sand-blasted before being painted.\n\nThe [[Washington Toll Bridge Authority]] hired Professor Frederick Burt Farquharson, an engineering professor at the [[University of Washington]], to make [[wind-tunnel]] tests and recommend solutions in order to reduce the oscillations of the bridge. Professor Farquharson and his students built a 1:200-scale model of the bridge and a 1:20-scale model of a section of the deck. The first studies concluded on November 2, 1940\u2014five days before the bridge collapse on November 7. He proposed two solutions:\n* To drill holes in the lateral girders and along the deck so that the air flow could circulate through them (in this way reducing [[lift (force)|lift forces]]).\n* To give a more [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] shape to the transverse section of the deck by adding fairings or deflector vanes along the deck, attached to the girder fascia.\nThe first option was not favored because of its irreversible nature. The second option was the chosen one, but it was not carried out, because the bridge collapsed five days after the studies were concluded.<ref name=\"RichardScott\"/>\n\n==Collapse==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TacomaNarrowsBridgeCollapse in color.jpg|thumb|The bridge collapsing, in a frame from a 16 mm Kodachrome motion picture film taken by Barney Elliott]] -->\nThe wind-induced collapse occurred on November 7, 1940, at approximately 11:00&nbsp;a.m. (PST), and was caused by a physical phenomenon known as [[aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic flutter]].<ref name=\"BillahScanlan91\"/>\n\nLeonard Coatsworth, a ''[[Tacoma News Tribune]]'' editor, was the last person to drive on the bridge:\n\n{{quote|Around me I could hear concrete cracking.

It included [[Othmar Ammann]] and [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]]. Without drawing any definitive conclusions, the commission explored three possible failure causes:\n* Aerodynamic instability by self-induced vibrations in the structure\n* Eddy formations that might be periodic in nature\n* Random effects of turbulence, that is the random fluctuations in velocity of the wind.\n\n===Cause of the collapse===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nThe original Tacoma Narrows Bridge was the first to be built with girders of carbon [[steel]] anchored in concrete blocks; preceding designs typically had open lattice beam trusses underneath the roadbed. This bridge was the first of its type to employ plate girders (pairs of deep [[I-beam]]s) to support the roadbed. With the earlier designs, any wind would simply pass through the truss, but in the new design the wind would be diverted above and below the structure. Shortly after construction finished at the end of June (opened to traffic on July 1, 1940), it was discovered that the bridge would sway and [[buckling|buckle]] dangerously in relatively mild windy conditions that are common for the area, and worse during severe winds. This vibration was [[transverse wave|transverse]], one-half of the central span rising while the other lowered. Drivers would see cars approaching from the other direction rise and fall, riding the violent energy wave through the bridge. However, at that time the mass of the bridge was considered to be sufficient to keep it structurally sound.\n\nThe failure of the bridge occurred when a never-before-seen twisting mode occurred, from winds at {{convert|40|mph}}. This is a so-called torsional [[vibration mode]] (which is different from the [[transverse mode|transversal]] or [[longitudinal mode|longitudinal]] vibration mode), whereby when the left side of the roadway went down, the right side would rise, and vice versa (i.e., the two halves of the bridge twisted in opposite directions), with the center line of the road remaining still (motionless). This vibration was caused by [[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic fluttering]].\n\n[[File:Tacoma Bridge Animation.ogv|thumb|Full-scale, two-way Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) model of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge exhibiting aeroelastic flutter]] Fluttering is a physical phenomenon in which several [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] of a structure become coupled in an unstable oscillation driven by the wind. Here, unstable means that the forces and effects that cause the oscillation are not checked by forces and effects that limit the oscillation, so it does not self-limit but grows without bound.  Eventually, the amplitude of the motion produced by the fluttering increased beyond the strength of a vital part, in this case the suspender cables.  As several cables failed, the weight of the deck transferred to the adjacent cables, which became overloaded and broke in turn until almost all of the central deck fell into the water below the span.\n\n====Resonance (due to Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street) hypothesis====\n[[Image:Vortex-street-animation.gif|thumb|right|Vortex shedding and [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]] behind a circular cylinder.

H. Freeman]] | location= | isbn=978-0-7167-0903-9 | pages=|year=2004 }})</ref>) wrongly explain that the cause of the failure of the Tacoma Narrows bridge was externally forced mechanical resonance. Resonance is the tendency of a system to oscillate at larger amplitudes at certain frequencies, known as the system's natural frequencies. At these frequencies, even relatively small periodic driving forces can produce large amplitude vibrations, because the system stores energy. For example, a child using a swing realizes that if the pushes are properly timed, the swing can move with a very large amplitude. The driving force, in this case the child pushing the swing, exactly replenishes the energy that the system loses if its frequency equals the natural frequency of the system.\n\nUsually, the approach taken by those physics textbooks is to introduce a first order  forced oscillator, defined by the [[second-order differential equation]]\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>m\\ddot{x}(t) + c\\dot{x}(t) + kx(t) = F \\cos (\\omega t)</math>  |{{EquationRef|eq. 1}}}}\n\nwhere {{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|k}} stand for the [[mass]], [[damping coefficient]] and [[stiffness]] of the [[linear system]] and {{mvar|F}} and {{mvar|\u03c9}} represent the amplitude and the [[angular frequency]] of the exciting force.  The solution of such [[ordinary differential equation]] as a function of time {{mvar|t}} represents the displacement response of the system (given appropriate initial conditions). In the above system resonance happens when {{mvar|\u03c9}} is approximately <math>\\omega_r = \\sqrt{k/m}</math>, i.e. <math>\\omega_r</math> is the natural (resonant) frequency of the system. The actual vibration analysis of a more complicated mechanical system\u2014such as an airplane, a building or a bridge\u2014is based on the linearization of the equation of motion for the system, which is a multidimensional version of equation ({{EquationNote|eq. 1}}). The analysis requires [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] analysis and thereafter the natural frequencies of the structure are found, together with the so-called ''fundamental modes'' of the system, which are a set of independent displacements and/or rotations that specify completely the displaced or deformed position and orientation of the body or system, i.e., the bridge moves as a (linear) combination of those basic deformed positions.\n\nEach structure has natural frequencies.  For resonance to occur, it is necessary to have also periodicity in the excitation force. The most tempting candidate of the periodicity in the wind force was assumed to be the so-called [[vortex shedding]]. This is because bluff bodies (non-streamlined bodies), like bridge decks, in a fluid stream shed [[wake]]s, whose characteristics depend on the size and shape of the body and the properties of the fluid. These wakes are accompanied by alternating low-pressure vortices on the downwind side of the body (the so-called [[Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]]). The body will in consequence try to move toward the low-pressure zone, in an oscillating movement called [[vortex induced vibration|vortex-induced vibration]]. Eventually, if the frequency of vortex shedding matches the natural frequency of the structure, the structure will begin to resonate and the structure's movement can become self-sustaining.\n\nThe frequency of the vortices in the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street is called the Strouhal frequency <math>f_s</math>, and is given by\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\frac{f_s D}{U} = S</math>  |{{EquationRef|eq. 2}}}}\nHere, {{mvar|U}} stands for the flow velocity, {{mvar|D}} is a characteristic length of the bluff body and {{mvar|S}} is the dimensionless [[Strouhal number]], which depends on the body in question. For [[Reynolds Number]]s greater than 1000, the Strouhal number is approximately equal to 0.21. In the case of the Tacoma Narrows, {{mvar|D}}&nbsp; was approximately {{convert|8|ft}} and {{mvar|S}} was 0.20.\n\nIt was thought that the Strouhal frequency was close enough to one of the natural vibration frequencies of the bridge i.e. <math>2\\pi f_s = \\omega</math>, to cause resonance and therefore [[vortex induced vibration|vortex-induced vibration]].\n\nIn the case of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, this appears not to have been the cause of the catastrophic damage. According to Professor Frederick Burt Farquharson, an engineering professor at the University of Washington and one of the main researchers into the cause of the bridge collapse, the wind was steady at {{convert|42|mph}} and the frequency of the destructive mode was 12 cycles/minute (0.2 [[Hertz|Hz]]).<ref>F. B. Farquharson et al. Aerodynamic stability of suspension bridges with special reference to the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. University of Washington Engineering Experimental Station, Seattle. Bulletin 116. Parts I to V. A series of reports issued since June 1949 to June 1954.</ref> This frequency was neither a natural mode of the isolated structure nor the frequency of blunt-body [[vortex shedding]] of the bridge at that wind speed (which was approximately 1&nbsp;Hz). It can be concluded therefore that the vortex shedding was not the cause of the bridge collapse. The event can be understood only while considering the coupled aerodynamic and structural system that requires rigorous mathematical analysis to reveal all the degrees of freedom of the particular structure and the set of design loads imposed.\n\nVortex-induced vibration is a far more complex process that involves both the external wind-initiated forces and internal self-excited forces that lock on to the motion of the structure. During lock-on, the wind forces drive the structure at or near one of its natural frequencies, but as the amplitude increases this has the effect of changing the local fluid boundary conditions, so that this induces compensating, self-limiting forces, which restrict the motion to relatively benign amplitudes. This is clearly not a linear resonance phenomenon, even if the bluff body has itself linear behaviour, since the exciting force amplitude is a nonlinear force of the structural response.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Billah, K.Y.R. and Scanlan, R.H. \"Vortex-Induced Vibration and its Mathematical Modeling: A Bibliography\", Report No. SM-89-1.

Yusuf Billah and Robert Scanlan. According to the two engineers, the failure of the bridge was related to a wind-driven amplification of the torsional oscillation that, unlike a resonance, increases monotonically with increasing wind speed. The fluid dynamics behind that amplification is complicated, but one key element, as described by physicists Daniel Green and William Unruh, is the creation of large-scale vortices above and below the roadway, or deck, of the bridge. Nowadays, bridges are constructed to be rigid and to have mechanisms that damp oscillations. Sometimes they include a slot in the middle of the deck to alleviate pressure differences above and below the road.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = The Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse|journal =[[Physics Today]]|date = 2015-11-01|issn = 0031-9228|pages = 64\u201365|volume = 68|issue = 11|doi = 10.1063/PT.3.2991|first = Donald W.|last = Olson|first2 = Steven F.|last2 = Wolf|first3 = Joseph M.|last3 = Hook|bibcode = 2015PhT....68k..64O |doi-access = free}}</ref> }}\n\nTo some degree the debate is due to the lack of a commonly accepted precise definition of resonance.

It would appear not to contradict the qualitative definition of resonance quoted earlier, if we now identify the source of the periodic impulses as ''self-induced'', the wind supplying the power, and the motion supplying the power-tapping mechanism.  If one wishes to argue, however, that it was a case of ''externally forced linear resonance'', the mathematical distinction ... is quite clear, self-exciting systems differing strongly enough from ordinary linear resonant ones.\"\n\n== Link to the Armistice Day blizzard ==\nThe weather system that caused the bridge collapse went on to cause the [[Armistice Day Blizzard]] that killed 145 people in the [[Midwest]]:\n\n{{quote|The strong winds in the Tacoma Narrows on 7 November 1940 were related to a remarkable low-pressure system that followed a track across the country and four days later produced the Armistice Day storm, one of the greatest storms ever to strike the Great Lakes region.

They were dismantled, and the steel sent to recyclers.\n\n===Preservation of the collapsed roadway===\n[[Image:GertieRemains 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Remains of the collapsed bridge]]\n\nThe underwater remains of the highway deck of the old suspension bridge act as a large artificial reef, and these are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] with reference number 92001068.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2007a}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/TNBhistory/|title=WSDOT \u2013 Tacoma Narrows Bridge: Extreme History|publisher=[[Washington State Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Harbor History Museum]] has a display in its main gallery regarding the 1940 bridge, its collapse, and the subsequent two bridges.\n\n===A lesson for history===\n[[Othmar Ammann]], a leading bridge designer and member of the Federal Works Agency Commission investigating the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, wrote:\n\n{{quote|The Tacoma Narrows bridge failure has given us invaluable information\u2026 It has shown [that] every new structure [that] projects into new fields of magnitude involves new problems for the solution of which neither theory nor practical experience furnish an adequate guide.

Wind-tunnel testing of bridge designs eventually became mandatory.}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bronx Whitestone Bridge]], which is of similar design to the 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge, was reinforced shortly after the collapse. Fourteen-foot-high (4.3 m) steel trusses were installed on both sides of the deck in 1943 to weigh down and stiffen the bridge in an effort to reduce oscillation. In 2003, the stiffening trusses were removed and aerodynamic fiberglass fairings were installed along both sides of the road deck.\n\nA key consequence was that suspension bridges reverted to a deeper and heavier [[truss]] design, including the replacement [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1950)]], until the development in the 1960s of [[box girder bridges]] with an [[aerofoil]] shape such as the [[Severn Bridge]], which gave the necessary stiffness together with reduced torsional forces.\n\n== Replacement bridge ==\n{{Main|Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1950)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge}}\nBecause of shortages in materials and labor as a result of the involvement of the United States in World War II, it took 10 years before a replacement bridge was opened to traffic. This replacement bridge was opened to traffic on October 14, 1950, and is {{convert|5979|ft}} long, {{convert|40|ft|spell=in}} longer than the original bridge. The replacement bridge also has more lanes than the original bridge, which only had two traffic lanes, plus shoulders on both sides.\n\nHalf a century later, the replacement bridge had exceeded its traffic capacity, and a second, parallel suspension bridge was constructed to carry eastbound traffic. The suspension bridge that was completed in 1950 was reconfigured to carry only westbound traffic. The new parallel bridge opened to traffic in July 2007.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of bridge disasters]]\n* [[List of structural failures and collapses]]\n* [[Engineering disasters]]\n* [[Millennium Bridge, London]], for an engineering error\n* [[Silver Bridge]]\n* [[Volgograd Bridge]], a bridge in Russia which experienced similar problems with the wind\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [https://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-myth-of-galloping-gertie \"The Strangest, Most Spectacular Bridge Collapse (And How We Got It Wrong)\"] (December 2015).
