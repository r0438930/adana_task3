The Tilkitepe Mound, which is on the shores of Lake Van and a few kilometres to the south of [[Van Castle]], is the only source of information about the oldest culture of Van.\n\n===Urartu===\n[[File:Xerxes Cuneiform Van.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Xerxes I's inscription at Van|Inscription of Xerxes the Great]] on the cliffs below [[Van Fortress|Van castle]].]]\n[[File:Akhtamar Island on Lake Van with the Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Lake Van]]]]\n\nUnder the ancient name of ''[[Tushpa]]'', Van was the capital of the [[Urartu|Urartian kingdom]] in the 9th century BC. The early settlement was centered on the steep-sided bluff now known as [[Van Castle]] (''Van Kalesi''), close to the edge of Lake Van and a few kilometers west of the modern city. Here have been found Urartian [[cuneiform]] inscriptions dating to the 8th and 7th centuries BC. In the trilingual [[Behistun]] [[inscription]], carved in the order of [[Darius the Great]] of [[Persia]], the country referred to as ''[[Urartu]]'' in Babylonian is called ''[[Armenia]]'' in Old Persian.\n\nThe name 'Van' comes from the [[Urartian language|Urartian]] ''Biaina''.<ref>Edmund Herzig, Marina Kurkchiyan, ''The Armenians: Past And Present In The Making Of National Identity'', p. 31</ref>\n\n===Kingdom of Armenia===\nThe region came under the control of the [[Orontid dynasty|Orontids]] in the 7th century BC and quickly later the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in the mid 6th century BC. The [[Van Fortress]] located outside Van holds an inscribed stereotyped trilingual inscription of [[Xerxes the Great]] from the 5th century BC upon a smoothed section of the rock face, some {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} above the ground near the fortress. The inscription survives in near perfect condition and is divided into three columns of 27 lines written in (from left to right) [[Old Persian]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], and [[Elamite]]. In 331 BC, Van was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] and after his death became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. By the early 2nd century BC it was part of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. It became an important center during the reign of the [[Armenia]]n king, [[Tigranes II of Armenia|Tigranes II]], who founded the city of [[Tigranocerta|Tigranakert]] in the 1st century BC.<ref>The Journal of Roman Studies \u2013 Page 124 by Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies</ref> In the early centuries BC, it fell to the emerging [[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia]] until the 3rd century AD. However, it also fell once to the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia]] in this timespan. In the ''[[History of Armenia (Movses Khorenatsi)|History of Armenia]]'' attributed to [[Movses Khorenatsi]], the city is called ''Tosp'', from Urartian ''Tushpa''.<ref>http://rbedrosian.com/Classic/kvan1.htm</ref>\n\n===Byzantines, Sassanids, and the Artsrunis===\n{{Main|Vaspurakan}}\nFollowing the fall of the Parthians and the emergence of the Neo-Persian Empire, better known as the [[Sassanian Empire]],<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sass/hd_sass.htm The Met Museum Website: The Sasanian Empire (224\u2013651 A.D.)]</ref> the town naturally fell into the possession of the latter. During the over 700 years lasting [[Roman-Persian Wars]], some of the wars razed at or around the location of modern-day Van. The [[Byzantine Empire]] briefly held the region from 628 to 640, following the victory in the climactic [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]], after which it was invaded by the Muslim Arabs, who consolidated their conquests as the province of [[Arminiya]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9lHeh36S8ooC&pg=PT1462&lpg=PT1462&dq=arabs+consolidated+arminiya&source=bl&ots=POFYPrUuOa&sig=0j_GVrgMMeoHT6j4mQ9oKRxQ2fU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5-67O6rPRAhVKJCYKHc8wAlwQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&q=arabs%20consolidated%20arminiya&f=false The Cambridge Medieval History Series volumes 1\u20135 by Plantagenet Publishing, 2nd to last paragraph on the page linked to.

After their victory in 1071 at the [[battle of Manzikert]] the entire region fell under their control. After them, local Muslim rulers emerged, such as the [[Ahlatshahs]] and the [[Ayyubids]] (1207). For a 20-year period, Van was held by the [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm|Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] until the 1240s when it was conquered by the [[Mongols]]. In the 14th century, Van was held by the [[Timurids]], followed subsequently by the Turkoman [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]] confederations.\n\n===Turco-Iranian rivalry and the Ottoman era===\n{{see also|Eyalet of Van|Vilayet of Van}}\nThe first half of the 15th century saw the Van region become a land of conflict as it was disputed by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the neighboring Persian [[Safavid]] Empire. The Safavids captured Van in 1502, as it went naturally with all former territories of the Ak Koyunlu. The Ottomans took the city in 1515 following the climactic [[Battle of Chaldiran]] and held it for a short period. The Safavids retook it again in 1520 but the Ottomans gained an almost definite hold of it in 1548 during another Ottoman-Safavid War. Ottoman control over the town got confirmed in the 1555 [[Peace of Amasya]] which came as a result after the end of the war. They first made Van into a [[sanjak]] dependent on the [[Erzurum eyalet]], and later into a separate [[Van eyalet]] in about 1570. In 1602, the Safavids under king [[Abbas the Great]] recaptured Van alongside other swaths of lost territories in Eastern Anatolia. However, Ottoman control over it was at last now made final and definite in 1639 with the [[Treaty of Zuhab]].\n\n[[File:Wan_Tournefort.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Van from [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]]'s 1717 book ''Relation d'un voyage du Levant'']]\n[[File:The Rock and Walled City of Van (1893).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The rock and walled city of Van in 1893 by [[H.

During the period leading up to the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, Armenians were well represented in the local administration.<ref>Hewler, 39</ref>\n\n====Demographics====\nThe demographics of Ottoman Van are a debated and contentious point as they relate directly to claims of ownership by either side prior to the outbreak of World War I. For the city of Van itself it's estimated that it had 50,000 inhabitants prior to World War I, of whom 30,000 were Armenian and 20,000 were Muslims. Based on the official 1914 Ottoman Census the population of Van province consisted of 179,422 Muslims and 67,797 Armenians.<ref>Values as printed in the [[:File:Proportions des populations en Asie Mineure statistique officielle d1914.png|official statistics from 1914]].</ref> The Ottoman Census figures include only male citizens, excluding women and children. According to a more recent research, the corrected estimates for the Van province (including women and children) are: 313,000 Muslims, 130,000 Armenians, and 65,000 others, including [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].<ref>Justin McCarthy: ''Muslims and Minorities.'' New York University Press, 1983, p. 110 f.</ref>\n\nThe demographics of Van are a greatly debated point, given the changing provincial borders. For example, in 1875 the province was divided; Van and Hakkari were separated, only to be rejoined in 1888, drastically changing the census numbers. Some writers argue that this merging was done to keep the Armenians from forming a majority.<ref>Hewsen, 35.</ref> In 1862 it was estimated that in Van there were 90,100 Christians (including [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]]) and 95,100 Muslims.<ref>[[Anahide Ter Minassian]]: \"The city of Van at the Turn of the Twentieth Century.\" In: Richard G.

The Tilkitepe Mound, which is on the shores of Lake Van and a few kilometres to the south of [[Van Castle]], is the only source of information about the oldest culture of Van.\n\n===Urartu===\n[[File:Xerxes Cuneiform Van.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Xerxes I's inscription at Van|Inscription of Xerxes the Great]] on the cliffs below [[Van Fortress|Van castle]].]]\n[[File:Akhtamar Island on Lake Van with the Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Lake Van]]]]\n\nUnder the ancient name of ''[[Tushpa]]'', Van was the capital of the [[Urartu|Urartian kingdom]] in the 9th century BC. The early settlement was centered on the steep-sided bluff now known as [[Van Castle]] (''Van Kalesi''), close to the edge of Lake Van and a few kilometers west of the modern city. Here have been found Urartian [[cuneiform]] inscriptions dating to the 8th and 7th centuries BC. In the trilingual [[Behistun]] [[inscription]], carved in the order of [[Darius the Great]] of [[Persia]], the country referred to as ''[[Urartu]]'' in Babylonian is called ''[[Armenia]]'' in Old Persian.\n\nThe name 'Van' comes from the [[Urartian language|Urartian]] ''Biaina''.<ref>Edmund Herzig, Marina Kurkchiyan, ''The Armenians: Past And Present In The Making Of National Identity'', p. 31</ref>\n\n===Kingdom of Armenia===\nThe region came under the control of the [[Orontid dynasty|Orontids]] in the 7th century BC and quickly later the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in the mid 6th century BC. The [[Van Fortress]] located outside Van holds an inscribed stereotyped trilingual inscription of [[Xerxes the Great]] from the 5th century BC upon a smoothed section of the rock face, some {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} above the ground near the fortress. The inscription survives in near perfect condition and is divided into three columns of 27 lines written in (from left to right) [[Old Persian]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], and [[Elamite]]. In 331 BC, Van was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] and after his death became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. By the early 2nd century BC it was part of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. It became an important center during the reign of the [[Armenia]]n king, [[Tigranes II of Armenia|Tigranes II]], who founded the city of [[Tigranocerta|Tigranakert]] in the 1st century BC.<ref>The Journal of Roman Studies \u2013 Page 124 by Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies</ref> In the early centuries BC, it fell to the emerging [[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia]] until the 3rd century AD.

After their victory in 1071 at the [[battle of Manzikert]] the entire region fell under their control. After them, local Muslim rulers emerged, such as the [[Ahlatshahs]] and the [[Ayyubids]] (1207). For a 20-year period, Van was held by the [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm|Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] until the 1240s when it was conquered by the [[Mongols]]. In the 14th century, Van was held by the [[Timurids]], followed subsequently by the Turkoman [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]] confederations.\n\n===Turco-Iranian rivalry and the Ottoman era===\n{{see also|Eyalet of Van|Vilayet of Van}}\nThe first half of the 15th century saw the Van region become a land of conflict as it was disputed by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the neighboring Persian [[Safavid]] Empire. The Safavids captured Van in 1502, as it went naturally with all former territories of the Ak Koyunlu. The Ottomans took the city in 1515 following the climactic [[Battle of Chaldiran]] and held it for a short period. The Safavids retook it again in 1520 but the Ottomans gained an almost definite hold of it in 1548 during another Ottoman-Safavid War. Ottoman control over the town got confirmed in the 1555 [[Peace of Amasya]] which came as a result after the end of the war. They first made Van into a [[sanjak]] dependent on the [[Erzurum eyalet]], and later into a separate [[Van eyalet]] in about 1570. In 1602, the Safavids under king [[Abbas the Great]] recaptured Van alongside other swaths of lost territories in Eastern Anatolia. However, Ottoman control over it was at last now made final and definite in 1639 with the [[Treaty of Zuhab]].\n\n[[File:Wan_Tournefort.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Van from [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]]'s 1717 book ''Relation d'un voyage du Levant'']]\n[[File:The Rock and Walled City of Van (1893).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The rock and walled city of Van in 1893 by [[H.

For the city of Van itself it's estimated that it had 50,000 inhabitants prior to World War I, of whom 30,000 were Armenian and 20,000 were Muslims. Based on the official 1914 Ottoman Census the population of Van province consisted of 179,422 Muslims and 67,797 Armenians.<ref>Values as printed in the [[:File:Proportions des populations en Asie Mineure statistique officielle d1914.png|official statistics from 1914]].</ref> The Ottoman Census figures include only male citizens, excluding women and children. According to a more recent research, the corrected estimates for the Van province (including women and children) are: 313,000 Muslims, 130,000 Armenians, and 65,000 others, including [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].<ref>Justin McCarthy: ''Muslims and Minorities.'' New York University Press, 1983, p. 110 f.</ref>\n\nThe demographics of Van are a greatly debated point, given the changing provincial borders. For example, in 1875 the province was divided; Van and Hakkari were separated, only to be rejoined in 1888, drastically changing the census numbers. Some writers argue that this merging was done to keep the Armenians from forming a majority.<ref>Hewsen, 35.</ref> In 1862 it was estimated that in Van there were 90,100 Christians (including [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]]) and 95,100 Muslims.<ref>[[Anahide Ter Minassian]]: \"The city of Van at the Turn of the Twentieth Century.\" In: Richard G.

He was finally acquitted but lost his rectorate. He is a grandson of [[G\u00fcll\u00fc Agop|Agop Vartovyan]], an Ottoman Armenian who is accepted as the founder of modern Turkish theatre.

Highway D975 runs north to Dogubeyazit and south towards Hakkari. Frequent buses and dolmuses ply these highways.\n\nVan is the western terminus of the railway line from Iran, with freight and passenger trains (suspended between 2015 and 2018). There is a [[train ferry]] (upgraded in 2015) across the lake to Tatvan. There is no railway around the lake; it is intended eventually to build one but to date there are no plans. This would actually create an unbroken rail link between Europe and the Indian subcontinent, as Tatvan is the terminus of the line to Ankara and Istanbul.\n\nVan has daily flights to Istanbul, Ankara and other major Turkish cities from  [[Van Ferit Melen Airport|Ferit Melen Airport]].\n\n==Media==\nNear Van, there is a [[longwave]] broadcasting station with a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=mid|-tall}} guyed mast.
