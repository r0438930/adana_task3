It was originally serialized in ''[[Woman's Day]]'' as ''The Great Dog Robbery''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedca.org/Historical/101BreedPopularity.pdf|title='101 Dalmatians' and Breed Popularity in the U.S.|last=Steinmetz|first=Cheryl|date=2005|website=Dalmatian Club Of America|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[The Starlight Barking]]'', continues from the end of the novel.\n\nAt a [[dinner|dinner party]] attended by the Dearly couple, [[Cruella de Vil]] expresses her dislike for animals; subsequently, the couple's new [[Dalmatian dog|Dalmatian]] puppies disappear. The Dearly dogs are now among 97 puppies who were kidnapped or legally purchased from various owners, with the intention of skinning them for their [[fur]]. Through the co-operation of animals and the \"Twilight barking\", the dogs are found in [[Suffolk]], England, and a rescue ensues.\n\n==Plot==\nPongo and Missis are a pair of [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]]s who live with the newly married Mr. and Mrs. Dearly and their two nannies, Nanny Cook and Nanny Butler. Mr. Dearly is a \"financial wizard\" who has been granted lifelong tax exemption and lent a house on the Outer Circle in [[Regent's Park]] in return for wiping out the [[government debt]]. The dogs consider the humans their pets, but allow the humans to think that they are the owners.\n\nMissis gives birth to a litter of 15 puppies. Concerned that Missis will not be able to feed them all, the humans join in to help. As Mrs. Dearly looks for a canine [[wet nurse]], she finds an exhausted liver-spotted Dalmatian in the middle of the road in the pouring rain. She has the dog treated by a vet, learns that she has recently given birth, and names her Perdita (meaning \"lost\"). Perdita helps to nurse the pups and becomes a member of the family, later telling Pongo about her lost love Prince and the resulting litter of puppies which were sold by her owner, and that she had run away looking for those puppies.\n\nOne day, while walking Pongo and Missis, Mr. and Mrs. Dearly have a chance meeting with an old schoolmate of Mrs. Dearly: Cruella de Vil, a very wealthy woman so fixated on fur clothing that she married a furrier and forces him to keep his fur collection in their home so she can wear the pieces whenever she likes. She admires the two dogs and expresses a desire to have a Dalmatian-skin coat. She happens to be in the house when the puppies start to arrive, and offers to buy them all. They refuse, and shortly after that the puppies disappear. The humans fail to trace them but through the \"Twilight Barking\", a forum of communication in which dogs can relay messages to each other across the country, the dogs track them down to \"Hell Hall\", the ancestral home of the de Vil family in [[Suffolk]]. Pongo and Missis try to tell the Dearlys where the puppies are but fail: Pongo tried to say the human word \"Suffolk\" but could not make the \"s\" sound. The dogs decide to find the puppies themselves, leaving Perdita to look after the Dearlys. After an eventful journey across the English countryside, with food and accommodation along the way arranged by dogs through the Barking Network, they meet the Colonel, an [[Old English Sheepdog]] at [[Withermarsh]] in Suffolk; he shows them Hell Hall and tells them its history. They get inside the mansion and discover that there are 97 puppies in Hell Hall, including Pongo and Missis' own 15.\n\nCruella de Vil arrives and tells the two crooks in charge of Hell Hall that they must slaughter and skin the dogs as soon as possible because of the publicity surrounding the theft of the Dearlys' puppies. Pongo and Missis realize they must rescue all of the puppies immediately and they escape the night before Christmas Eve. One puppy, Cadpig, is a [[runt]] and too weak to walk the long distance from Suffolk to London so Tommy, the Colonel's two-year-old owner, lends her a toy farm cart; one of the litters of puppies is just the right age for two of its members to fit its shaft, so they pull it in shifts. When Cruella returns to find the puppies gone, she begins to pursue them. However, the Dalmatians have encountered one of the Barking Network dogs, who points out how conspicuous they are and helps them break into a chimney sweep's establishment where they roll in [[soot]] to disguise themselves. Cruella nearly catches up with them, but they are able to hide in an empty removal van at the invitation of a [[Staffordshire Bull Terrier|Staffordshire terrier]] whose \"pets\" own the van\u2014which is returning to London that very night.\n\nUpon arriving in London, the dogs destroy the de Vils' collection of animal skins and fur coats with the help of Cruella's cat, who was angry and distressed at losing many litters of kittens which Cruella had drowned. The Dalmatians then return to the Dearlys' house, where Pongo and Missis bark until Mr. Dearly opens the door, whereupon the whole mass of puppies go streaming in without stopping. Once the dogs roll on the carpet to remove the soot from their coats, the Dearlys recognise them and send out for steaks to feed them. The litter that pulled Cadpig's cart proved to be Perdita's litter by Prince. Mr. Dearly finds out where the puppies had been when he discovers a label on the toy cart which contains Tommy's name and address. The Dearlys also place advertisements seeking the owners of the other puppies, but it turns out that they had all been sold, rather than stolen as the Dearlys' were.\n\nCruella's now-homeless cat drops by (and is invited to stay) with the news that the destruction of her husband's fur business has forced Cruella to put Hell Hall up for sale. When the Dearlys visit Suffolk to return Tommy's cart, they realize that, with 97 puppies, and three adult Dalmatians, a larger home would be a good idea, so Mr Dearly buys the hall with money he has been given by the government for sorting out another tax problem. He proposes to use it to start a \"dynasty of Dalmatians\" (and a \"dynasty of Dearlys\" to take care of them). Finally, Perdita's lost love, Prince, turns up. His owners see his love for Perdita and allow him to stay with the Dearlys and become their \"one hundred and oneth\" Dalmatian.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n{{Main|One Hundred and One Dalmatians (franchise)}}\n[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] adapted the novel into an [[animated film]], released to cinemas on 25 January 1961 as ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''.
