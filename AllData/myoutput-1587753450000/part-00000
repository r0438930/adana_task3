It stars [[Kamal Haasan]] and [[Sridevi]] in the lead roles along with the music composed by [[Ilaiyaraaja]]. The film tells the story of Nehalata Malhotra (Sridevi), a young woman who regresses to childhood as result of [[retrograde amnesia]]  after suffering a head injury in a car crash. Lost, she ends up trapped in a [[brothel]] before being rescued by Somu (Kamal Haasan), a lonely school teacher who falls in love with her. The film was initially released on July 8, 1983 and then 2 weeks later released on July 22 in Delhi and other areas. \n\nThe film was a remake of Mahendra's own 1982 Tamil film ''[[Moondram Pirai]]'', which also starred Kamal and Sridevi.\nSadma was widely acclaimed by critics for its direction, screenplay, music and performances. Sridevi's performance as an amnesiac woman was widely praised and is considered as one of the finest performances in Indian film history. Although a commercial failure upon release, ''Sadma'' over the years has gained a cultural following and [[cult film|cult]] [[cult following|status]] and is considered to be one of the finest Indian movies to be ever made.<ref>{{cite web|last=Biswas|first=Soutik|title=A creative flowering|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bollywood-star-dimple-kapadia-matures-into-a-serious-actress/1/302509.html|work=[[India Today]]|accessdate=23 April 2014|date=15 July 1993}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[31st Filmfare Awards]], Sadma received three nominations :  \n[[Filmfare Award for Best Actor| Best Actor]] (Haasan) [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress| Best Actress]] (Sridevi),  and [[Filmfare Award for Best Story| Best Story]].\n\n==Plot==\n \nNehalata, a young woman, has a car accident while returning from a party and is hospitalised with severe head injuries. When she recovers, she is diagnosed with [[retrograde amnesia]] and she fails to recognise her own parents. She mentally regresses to the state of a child. While she is undergoing treatment, she is kidnapped and sold to the madam of a brothel.\nSomprakash also known as Somu comes to meet his old friend. Together, they visit the brothel to relax. The madam sends Nehalata, renamed Reshami, to his room. Somu realises that she is mentally still a child and pities her. He learns that she was kidnapped by some criminals and forced into prostitution.\n\nSomu returns the next day and takes Nehalata out, supposedly on a pleasure trip. He takes her away to Ooty, where he is working as a school teacher. He takes her to his residence, where he protects her. Reshami, as she is called by Somu, has completely forgotten her past and becomes very close to him. When Reshami accidentally spills ink over Somu's documents, angering him, their relationship is threatened, but they reconcile. Later, a local woodcutter named Balwant lusts for Reshami and nearly assaults her, but she manages to save herself. When she tells Somu about it, he becomes livid with rage and almost kills Balwant, but is stopped by his neighbours who were informed of the incident by Reshami. Meanwhile, the wife of Somu's headmaster is attracted to Somu, though he does not reciprocate her feelings.\n\nReshami's father who was searching her through the police, releases a newspaper advertisement about his lost daughter. A co-passenger who had travelled with Somu and Reshami to Ooty by train gives them a lead. Somu takes Reshami to a medical practitioner and leaves her there for a day's treatment. In his absence, the police come to his house searching for Reshami. Finally, the police learn that Reshami is getting treated at the doctor's place and reach there. Somu is unable to come as he is afraid of police action. The treatment goes through successfully. Reshami regains her memory and completely forgets about the period between her accident and recovery. Nehalata father and his wife are happy and decide to leave. From the doctor, Nehalata father learns that the person who had brought her there had been taking good care of their daughter; he withdraws his police complaint and they begin their journey home with Reshami.\n\nAfter the police leave, Somu comes running after the car in which Reshami is travelling. He follows them to the railway station and tries to gain Reshami's attention, but she is unable to recognise him. Somu acts like a dancing monkey that Reshami developed a liking for, but Reshami, unable to comprehend, thinks he is insane and begging for food. Somu continues his futile attempts to gain her attention, and the train eventually leaves with Reshami not recognising him. Somu, who was injured while chasing her car and trying to get her attention, is left alone, heartbroken.\n\n==Cast== \n<!--In order of the film's opening credits-->\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as Somprakash \"Somu\"\n* [[Sridevi]] as Nehalata Malhotra \"Reshmi\"\n* [[Gulshan Grover]] as Balua\n* [[Silk Smitha]] as Soni\n* [[Paintal]] as Paintal\n* [[Arvind Deshpande]] as J.
