'''Cesare De Titta''' ([[Sant'Eusanio del Sangro]], January 27, 1862– ''ibidem'', February 14, 1933) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] poet in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Latin]] and in [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan Abruzzese]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cesaredetitta.com/|title=Cesare De Titta – Dedicato al poeta abruzzese}}</ref><ref>Francesco Piga ''La poesia dialettale del Novecento'', Piccin Vallardi, 1991, pag. 61</ref>

His mother was Sofia Loreto, and his father, Vincenzo De Titta, was a public notary.

==Biography==
Foley was born in India in 1908 and began working as a journalist in Paris on the ''Paris Herald,'' a European edition of the ''[[New York Herald]]'' now known as the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''. From 1940 to 1955 he served as Foreign Editor on the British newspaper ''[[The Daily Express]]''.  In 1954 he interviewed Hitler's former commando chief, [[Otto Skorzeny]] – then living in Madrid. Foley subsequently wrote ''Commando Extraordinary, Otto Skorzeny'' (Longman Green, London, 1954), a well-crafted but laudatory account of Skorzeny's war-time exploits.

In 1955 Foley moved to [[Cyprus]] and took over ''[[The Cyprus Times]]'' newspaper at a moment in the islands history when a civil war was breaking out between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, and the Greek Cypriot [[EOKA]] movement was starting an armed struggle against the British colonial government in Cyprus.<ref>'The Press: Tough Times' in ''Time Magazine,'' 15 September 1958.</ref> He later published a number of books on Cyprus.

*''Island in revolt'' (London: Longmans, 1962)
*''Cyprus: Legacy of Strife'' (London: Penguin Books, 1962)
*''The struggle for Cyprus'' [together with W. I. Scobie] (Stanford, Calif.: Hoover Institution Press, 1975).

He also published ''The memoirs of General Grivas'' (London: Longmans, 1964), approved by the military leader of EOKA, [[Georgios Grivas]].

'''Cénacle''' is the name given to a [[Paris, France|Parisian]] literary group of varying constituency that began about 1826 to gather around [[Charles Nodier]]. The group sought to revive in [[French literature]] the old monarchical spirit, the spirit of medieval mystery and spiritual submission.  The chief members were [[Alfred de Vigny|Vigny]] and the brothers [[Émile Deschamps|Deschamps]].  They were soon joined by [[Alphonse de Lamartine|Lamartine]], [[Victor Hugo|Hugo]], and [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]], who describes the group as \"royalists by birth, Christians by convention and a vague sentimentality.\"  Their organ was ''La Muse Française''. [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]], [[Prosper Mérimée|Mérimée]], and the elder [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Dumas]] were involved within the Cénacle, too.  Time and the revolution of 1830 wrought changes in the attitudes of the members of Cénacle.  [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Gérard de Nerval]] were attracted to the group at the time of the revolution, but the reasons for the existence of the Cénacle dissolved. The group lost its reason for existence with the triumph of [[Victor Hugo|Hugo's]] ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'' (1830).

Time and the revolution of 1830 wrought changes in the attitudes of the members of Cénacle.  [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Gérard de Nerval]] were attracted to the group at the time of the revolution, but the reasons for the existence of the Cénacle dissolved. The group lost its reason for existence with the triumph of [[Victor Hugo|Hugo's]] ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'' (1830).

==Biography==

Jamieson, born in August 1843 at Bonnington, near [[Arbroath]], in Scotland, was educated at the burgh and parochial school of that town, and afterwards (1862) at [[Edinburgh High School]] and University. While still at college he acted as a sub-editor of ''Chambers's Etymological Dictionary,'' and subsequently became assistant to [[Samuel Halkett]], librarian of the [[Advocates' Library]].

In June 1871, on Halkett's death, Jamieson was appointed keeper of the library, and the work of printing the catalogue passed into his care. In 1872 he wrote a prefatory notice for an edition of [[Archie Armstrong]]'s ''Banquet of Jests,'' and in 1874 edited a reprint of Barclay's translation of Brandt's ''Ship of Fools,'' to which he prefixed a notice of [[Sebastian Brandt]] and his writings. In 1874 he also privately printed a ''Notice of the Life and Writings of [[Alexander Barclay]].''

The fire which occurred in the Advocates' Library in the summer of 1875 roused him to exertions beyond his strength, and he died at 7 Gillespie Crescent, [[Edinburgh]], on 9 January 1876, aged only 32. He married, on 11 June 1872, Jane Alison Kilgour, by whom he left two children.
