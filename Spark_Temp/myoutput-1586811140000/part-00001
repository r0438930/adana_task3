It educates 1 boy between the ages of 11 and 16 and is a specialist [[Engineering College (English specialist school)|Engineering]] and [[Business and Enterprise College]]. It is one of only three maintained boys' schools in West Sussex, and liaises closely with [[Millais School]], the girls' school in the town. It was formerly an 11{{ndash}}18 [[secondary modern school]], becoming an 11{{ndash}}16 comprehensive in 1976.\n\n== History ==\nThe school began following the separation of the Oxford Road senior school into separate schools for boys and girls in the mid-1940s. The boys' school - then named Horsham Secondary Modern School for Boys - moved to its current campus in Comptons Lane in 1954. In 1958, the girls' school was relocated to a nearby site, and both schools were renamed under the Forest name, leading to the opening of the Forest secondary boys school.<ref name=\"vic\">{{cite journal | author=T.P.

The Forest school was reconstituted as an 11{{ndash}}16 boys comprehensive, with sixth form provision moving to [[The College of Richard Collyer]].<ref name=\"vic\"/>\n\nFor a period of time which included 1979{{ndash}}1985, the school was divided into departments or \"Houses\", each its own colour.\n\nBrunel - Art/Design/Metalwork/Woodwork (Pink), \nFaraday - Sciences (Yellow), \nMansion - Languages (Light Blue), \nNewton - Mathematics (Red), \nShelley - English language/Literature (Dark Blue), \nTyler - Humanities (Green)\n\nIn the late '70's and early '80's, the first computers arrived and these were Commodore Pets (2 with 1Kb memory and 1 with 32Kb memory).  These were under the care of the Mathematics department and were later joined by a batch of 16Kb \"Pets\" and a BBC Micro. The Science Department procured a Sinclair ZX80, then a ZX81 as their first computers.\n\nIn 2008, the past Houses (Tudor, Stuart, Lancaster, and York) were disbanded, and new \"communities\" were formed (Dyson, Hawking, Branson and Marconi respectively). The school has introduced a '[[vertical tutoring|Vertical Tutor Group]]' system, which was put into practice in June 2009. \n\n\nThis was edited in September 2019, when Year 11's were removed from Vertical Tutor groups and placed in Year 11-only groups, purportedly to help them revise, although the effectiveness of this move is debatable.\n\nAt the end of 2009 The Forest School Radio was launched. The station was ran by students, and the episodes were downloadable podcasts usually available weekly, however, it has since been discontinued.\n\nIn April 2010 the redesigned school website was launched complete with virtual learning facilities, which are now used mostly for homework and revision material.

Prefects wear the same uniform except for the shirt, where instead of white they wear blue and a thinner-striped community-coloured tie.\n\nSenior Prefects wear a badge stating their role. It is worn on the tie and is the Community colour. Furthermore, the Senior Prefects wear all-black ties, with  logos in their respective community colours. There are 20 Senior Prefects, including the Head Boy and Deputy Head Boy. Head Boy and Deputy Head Boy have an all black tie with a blue stripe along the bottom, also with a badge.\n\nIn 2010, a new summer uniform was introduced which consists of a black polo shirt with the school's logo and community name, instead of the usual white shirt with tie. The uniform returns to normal during the winter.\n\n== Events ==\n* The school hosts events organised by staff and pupils. This includes football matches between the students and the teachers. \n* There is an annual Performance Evening, which is drama, dance, PE, music, and art. \n* In June 2009, an annual event was introduced called 'The FM Factor', a talent show featuring pupils from both Forest and Millais school (hosted at Forest) in which pupils perform dancing, singing, acting, and stand up comedy. In 2009, the contest was won by [[Michael Jackson]] Tribute Group \"The Thrillerz\", who performed a medley of Jacksons hits from the 1980s.\n* In July 2009, three pupils organised and choreographed a 'Teachers got Talent' show featuring musical performances from the staff - and featuring successful acts from the 2009 FM Factor. The event raised \u00a3500 which went towards a local school for children with disabilities. \n* In July 2010 the school collaborated with [[Millais School]] to produce a production of [[Billy Elliot the Musical|'Billy Elliot: The Musical']] in celebration of the shows 5th anniversary in the London West End. It was performed at The Capitol Theatre in Horsham and had three sell-out performances. \n* On the second to last night of the summer term the school held the second FM Factor, the winners being [[Tribal Gaffa Tape]] who performed The Tesco Song.\n* In April 2011 the school put on a production of \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat\". \n* The school is regular entrants to the [[Rock Challenge UK|UK Rock Challenge]]. Its awards from this include 'Performers Choice' and 'Drugs Awareness Award' in 2009, 'Best Staging' in 2010, and 'Best Backstage Crew' in both 2009 and 2010.\nIn March 2012 the school put on a production of [[We Will Rock You (musical)]] with four performances over three days.\n\n== Charity ==\n* The school raises money for charity with events such as non-uniform days, cake sales, and teacher vs. pupil events. Pupils brought in items from their homes to send to [[Haiti]] after the devastating earthquakes.\n* In November 2013, the school raised \u00a31500 for the [[Typhoon Haiyan|2013 Philippines Disaster]] <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theforestschool.com/49/latest-news/article/72/fantastic-response-to-philippines-disaster-appeal |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213182842/http://www.theforestschool.com/49/latest-news/article/72/fantastic-response-to-philippines-disaster-appeal |archivedate=2013-12-13 }}</ref><ref>https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=586824304699165</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Schools in West Sussex}}\n\n[[Category:Horsham]]\n[[Category:Boys' schools in West Sussex]]\n[[Category:Comprehensive schools in West Sussex]]\n[[Category:Community schools in West Sussex]]\n[[Category:Secondary schools in West Sussex]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Infobox school \n| name          = The Forest School\n| image         = Forest School, Horsham Logo.png\n| image_size          =\n| coordinates   = {{coord|51.05948|-0.30672|type:edu_region:GB_dim:100|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| motto         = Where Boys Learn Best\n| established   = c. 1944\n| closed        = \n| type          = Boys' [[Comprehensive school|comprehensive]] [[Secondary school|secondary]]\n| religious_affiliation      = \n| president     = \n| head_label    = \n| head          = Mr I Straw<ref name=\"Staff\">{{cite web |title=The Forest School Teaching Staff |url=https://4905753ff3cea231a868-376d75cd2890937de6f542499f88a819.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/forest/uploads/document/Teaching-Staff-010918-1.pdf?ts=1537301401 |accessdate=18 September 2018}}</ref>\n| r_head        = \n| chair_label   = Chair of Governors\n| chair         = Mr C Purvis\n| founder       = \n| specialist    = [[Engineering College (English specialist school)|Engineering College]], [[Business and Enterprise College]]\n| address        = Comptons Lane\n| city          = [[Horsham]]\n| county        = [[West Sussex]]\n| country       = [[England]]\n| postcode      = RH13 5NW\n| local_authority           = [[West Sussex]]\n| ofsted        = yes\n| urn           = 126065\n| staff         = 120\n| enrolment    = 1100\n| gender        = Boys\n| lower_age     = 11\n| upper_age     = 16\n| communities        = Branson (Red), Dyson (Yellow), Hawking (Green), Marconi (Blue)\n| colours       = \n| publication   = \n| free_label_1  = \n| free_1        = \n| free_label_2  = \n| free_2        = \n| free_label_3  = \n| free_3        = \n| website       = http://www.theforestschool.com/\n}}\n\n'''The Forest School''' is a school full of sex slaves |comprehensive]] [[secondary school]] for boys in [[Horsham]], [[West Sussex]], [[England]].
