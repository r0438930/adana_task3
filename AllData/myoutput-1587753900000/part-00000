It is owned by [[iHeartMedia]]. Its studios are located in San Diego's [[Kearny Mesa, San Diego|Kearny Mesa]] neighborhood on the northeast side, and the [[transmitter]] is located in [[La Jolla, San Diego|La Jolla]]. It broadcasts from the [[KGTV Tower]], shared with several other San Diego FM stations and [[KGTV]].<ref>http://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/patg?id=KMYI-FM</ref> KMYI is the oldest continuously operating FM station in the San Diego metropolitan area.\n\nThe station is the San Diego affiliate for [[On Air with Ryan Seacrest]], and is one of few Hot AC stations to carry the program.\n\nKMYI broadcasts in [[HD Radio|HD]]. It carries the [[all-news radio|news]]/[[talk radio|talk]] programming of [[sister station]] [[KOGO (AM)|KOGO]] on its HD2 sub-channel. In November 2018, KMYI activated an HD3 sub-channel, which airs a Soft AC format branded as \"The Breeze.\" It is the only station in iHeart's San Diego cluster to have three HD channels.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1949\u20131996)===\nThe station [[sign-on|signed on]] in 1949 using the [[call sign]] '''KFSD-FM''' and [[simulcast]]ing KFSD (now KOGO).<ref>[[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-26]]</ref>  It carried the AM station's format of [[Middle of the road (music)|Middle of the Road]] music with news and personalities. As one of the earliest FM stations in [[Southern California]], it was originally powered at 100,000 [[watt]]s, and even today has more power (77,000 watts) than most of its rivals, which normally are limited to 50,000 watts. As FM radios became more available, especially among the affluent and [[audiophile]]s, KFSD-FM adopted a [[classical music]] format in 1956, for which it was known for nearly four decades.\n\n===Format changes and sale (1996\u20132000)===\nKFSD-FM was sold by Lotus Communications to [[Nationwide Communications]] in 1996. The new owners decided classical music would not have enough listeners and revenue, so the format was switched to [[classic hits]] as \"94.1 The Eagle\" on January 16, 1997, with the call letters '''KXGL'''.<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-01-24.pdf]</ref> KXGL was acquired in 1998 by [[Jacor]] Communications, which was later acquired by [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel Communications]].\n\nOn August 10, 1998, KXGL dropped the classic hits music format and call letters, switching to [[soft adult contemporary]] music as '''KJQY''', known as ''K-Joy 94.1'' to compete with leading AC station [[KYXY]].<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-08-07.pdf</ref> (The K-Joy call sign was on a previous KYXY competitor, KJQY.) In 2000, KJQY changed to a new format called ''Soft Oldies''. When [[Oldies]] station KBZT left the format in November of that year, KJQY became a mainstream oldies station (later moving to 95.7 and 99.3 and rebranded as \"KOOL\").<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/2000s/2000/RR-2000-11-24.pdf</ref>\n\n===Hot AC (2001\u2013present)===\n\n====Pre-launch poll; holiday music====\nOn November 21, 2001, KJQY swapped formats and call letters with ''[[KSSX|Mix 95.7]]'', also owned by Clear Channel. 94.1 (now with the placeholder KMSX calls) then began [[Stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] with a loop of [[Christmas music]]. At the same time, the station administered a poll, asking listeners what they would like to hear, and later began informing listeners to find out the poll results at 3 p.m. on December 25, 2001. \n====My 94.1====\nThe stunting continued until the advertised date and time, which at that point, the station's callsign became '''KMYI''', flipped to its present Hot AC format and branded as '''My 94.1'''. The first song under the Hot AC format was \"[[Breathe (Faith Hill song)|Breathe]]\" by [[Faith Hill]].<ref>http://formatchange.com/kjqy-becomes-my-94-1/</ref><ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/2000s/2002/RR-2002-01-04.pdf</ref> For a time, KMYI was simulcast in [[Temecula, California]] on [[KMYT (FM)|KMYT]] until December 2, 2004, when KMYT switched to a [[smooth jazz]] format. \n\n====Star 94.1====\nOn September 19, 2005, noted San Diego radio duo \"Jeff and Jer\" came to KMYI, and the station was rebranded as ''Star 94.1'', picking up both the morning show and the moniker from [[KFBG (FM)|KFMB-FM]], which had switched to [[adult hits]] and joined [[Jack FM]] earlier in the year.<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/2000s/2005/RR-2005-09-23.pdf]</ref> The station adopted the \"San Diego's Best Variety\" slogan to reflect its broadcast area, although it has recently began using the corporate \"More Music, More Variety\" slogan on air.\n\nClear Channel Communications became [[iHeartMedia]] in 2014. Through all of the changes that have occurred since becoming a hot AC station, the one constant at KMYI had taken place during the final weeks of the year: Up until 2014, KMYI had an annual tradition of playing all Christmas music, returning to its regular Hot AC format on December 26. This ended in 2015 to focus on [[New Year's Eve]] music content instead.\n\nToday, KMYI's chief rivals are KYXY, which has moved closer to a Hot AC format to gain younger listeners, and [[KXSN]], which broadcasts a [[Classic Hits]] format and calls itself ''Sunny 98.1'', Competition for this station is established by playing [[1990s in music|songs from the 1990s]] at the bottom of each hour.\n\n==Morning shows==\nKMYI has had many morning shows throughout the years:\n\nWhen the station first flipped to Hot AC in 2001, KMYI recruited Jagger and Kristi, their tenure lasted until summer 2005, when they would move to [[XHRM-FM|XHRM]].\n\nOn rebranding to \"Star 94.1\" in 2005, KMYI picked up the ''Jeff and Jer Showgram''. 2005 also saw the addition of notable personality Delana, who originally came in to co-host with Jeff and Jer.\n\nOn August 20, 2009, Jeff and Jer exited Star 94.1 to be replaced by AJ Machado from sister [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40]] station [[KHTS-FM]]. On August 31, 2009, \"AJ in the Morning\" debuted on Star 94.1 with most of the former \"Playhouse\" cast, with the exception of Geena The Latina, who remains at KHTS-FM.\n\nIn June 2012, the morning show was replaced with Jesse Lozano, who re-located to San Diego to host mornings on KMYI. Jesse also voicetracks in afternoons on [[KIIS-FM]] in [[Los Angeles]], and is also known as Boy Toy Jesse. \n\nOn August 16, 2019, it was announced that KMYI will welcome Tati (coming from [[KSSX]]), as their new morning co-host.<ref>{{cite news|last=Venta|first=Lance|url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/179720/tati-moves-to-kmyi-mornings/|title=Tati Moves To KMYI Mornings|website=Radio Insight|access-date=19 August 2019}}</ref> The newly rebranded \"Jesse and Tati\" program debuted on August 26. This change comes as outgoing co-host Delana announced her move to the afternoon drive spot, in addition to her role on iHeart's [[Pride Radio]] network.\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://star941fm.iheart.com/ Star 94.1 website]\n{{FM station data|KMYI}}\n*{{FCC letter|letterid=71772|hcards=yes|callsign=KMYI}}\n*[http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=58821&Callsign=KMYI Callsign History]\n\n{{San Diego Radio}}\n{{iHeartMedia}}\n\n[[Category:Adult top 40 radio stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Hot adult contemporary radio stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Nationwide Communications]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in San Diego|MYI]]\n[[Category:IHeartMedia radio stations]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Hot adult contemporary radio station in San Diego}}\n{{Infobox radio station\n| image            = KMYI.jpg\n| image_size       = 150px\n| name             = KMYI\n| city             = [[San Diego, California]]\n| area             = [[San Diego metropolitan area]]\n| branding         = ''Star 94.1''\n| slogan           = More Music, More Variety (general)<br>San Diego's Best Variety (on [[Radio Data System|RDS]] and on [[Instagram]])\n| frequency        = 94.1 [[Megahertz|MHz]] {{HD Radio}}\n| airdate          = [[1949 in radio|1949]] (as KFSD-FM)\n| format           = FM/HD1: [[Hot adult contemporary]]<br>HD2: [[News/talk]] ([[KOGO (AM)|KOGO]] simulcast)<br>HD3: [[Soft adult contemporary]] \"The Breeze\"\n| language         = [[California English|English]]\n| erp              = 77,000 [[watt]]s\n| haat             = 210 meters (689 feet)\n| class            = B\n| facility_id      = 58821\n| coordinates      = {{coord|32.839|N|117.250|W|type:landmark_region:US-CA_source:FCC|display=inline,title}}\n| callsign_meaning = '''K''' \"'''MY''' 94.'''I'''\" (derived from previous station name)\n| former_callsigns = KFSD-FM (1948\u20131963)<br>KOGO-FM (1963\u20131973)<br>KFSD-FM (1973\u20131997)<br>KXGL (1997\u20131998)<br>KJQY (1998\u20132001)<br>KMSX (2001)\n| affiliations     = \n| owner            = [[iHeartMedia]]\n| licensee         = Citicasters Licenses, Inc.\n| sister_stations  = [[KGB-FM]], [[KHTS-FM]], [[KIOZ]], [[KLSD]], [[KOGO (AM)|KOGO]], [[KSSX]]\n| webcast          = [https://www.iheart.com/live/star-941-253/ Listen Live]\n| website          = [https://star941fm.iheart.com/ star941fm.iheart.com]\n}}\n\n'''KMYI''' (94.1 [[Megahertz|MHz]], ''Star 94.1'') is a commercial [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[radio station]] in [[San Diego, California]], airing a [[hot adult contemporary]] music [[radio format|format]].
