{"title_page": "AquaNox", "text_new": "'''''AquaNox''''' is a series of [[submarine]]-based [[first-person shooter]]/[[Submarine simulator|simulation]] [[video game]]s set in the distant future. The collection includes ''AquaNox'', ''AquaNox 2: Revelation'' and ''AquaNox: The Angel's Tears''. The predecessor and the starter of the series is the [[MS-DOS]] title ''[[Archimedean Dynasty]]''.\n\n==Concept==\nIn the middle of the 22nd century, raw materials on [[Earth]] became increasingly scarce and as the end of the resources loomed, people began to prospect for resources on the ocean floor. This resulted in the construction of mining stations beneath the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean|Indian ocean]]s. Many countries set up these deep-sea stations where workers and engineers extracted the oceans' treasures. Nevertheless, the output was far from enough to cover an ever-increasing demand. When the natural resources on Earth's surface were depleted, a time of destruction and wars began. In the fight over the planet's last remaining resources, alliances fell apart, countries became hostile and old conflicts flared up.\n\nWith increasing cruelty and senselessness, man destroyed the very basis of life on the surface of the earth. After a series of resource wars, nuclear weapons [[nuclear holocaust|completed the destruction]] that man had not yet finished with his industrial pollution. When the last glimmer of hope for humanity's survival was extinguished, people fled into the depths of the oceans.\n\nThe former extraction stations became the last refuge of those fortunate enough to be able to pay the price of entry into the underwater world. The poorest of the poor were left behind, condemned to die in a desolate world polluted by radioactivity. Life outside the oceans became impossible as the continents were flooded by rising sea levels and a harsh [[nuclear winter]] covered most of the oceans and the shrinking surface landmass of the planet with a layer of [[radioactive dust]], snow and ice many meters thick. A 40-meter thick layer of dead organic matter, the so-called POM layer, covered the oceans. Not a single ray of sunlight penetrated the dense particulate layer that plunged the world into a darkness like none other. Nevertheless, mankind rose one last time to a new life, the only life, in a dead new world. This world was humanity's creation, and was now called Aqua. The following events take place in the middle of the 27th century.\n\nToday, in the year 2661, mankind lives in gigantic cities underwater. Aqua is divided into political power blocs, such as the Aquatoria of the capitalistic, democratically governed Atlantic Federation, the [[oligarchy]] of the Arabic Clans Union and the [[monarchy|monarchist]] Russo-Japanese [[Shogunate]]. In the South Pacific lies the Tornado Zone, stirred up by surface storms, where an anarchist pack of mercenaries, pirates, buccaneers and outlaws gathers, ever ready to sell their friends and their souls.\n\nA single company has long ago monopolized many industries necessary for human survival underwater\u2014EnTrOx, which stands for \"Energy-Transportation-[[Oxygen]]\". New technologies allow extremely fast underwater travel. However, many old technologies are lost or have become useless. For example, due to the high amounts of [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] in the atmosphere, satellite communication and [[Global Positioning System|global positioning]] are impossible, although some organizations are looking for ways to restore these abilities.\n\nThe player's task is to complete a series of story-related combat missions. During the course of the missions additional support and story elements are revealed by the secondary characters. The enemies range from hostile vessels to alien or artificial life-forms such as Bionts.\n\n==Episodes==\n\nThe Aquanox series include the following games, listed by the release in a [[chronological order]]:\n\n===''Archimedean Dynasty''===\n{{Main|Archimedean Dynasty}}\n\n===''AquaNox''===\n{{Infobox video game\n|title=AquaNox\n|image=AquaNox Coverart.jpg\n|developer=[[Massive Development]]\n|publisher=[[Ravensburger Interactive|Ravensburger Interactive Media]]\n|released=30 November 2001\n|genre=Futuristic Sub Sim\n|modes=[[Single-player]], [[Multiplayer]]\n|platforms=[[Microsoft Windows]]\n}}\n\nThe player once again jumps into the role of Emerald \"Deadeye\" Flint. After the Bionts are defeated, Flint goes back to being a mercenary as a leader of a Biont-hunting task force. Things turn for the worse when his submarine, the ''[[Succubus]]'', is stolen on one of the stations. The game begins with one of Flint's dubious acquaintances giving him an old, barely working sub and several missions to get him started.\n\nThroughout the game, Flint earns money by completing missions, allowing him to purchase better subs, weapons and equipment. The new equipment appears throughout the game, available for purchase, as the player progress in the storyline. Generally speaking, the player is allowed to buy a new boat and a new set of weaponry per chapter. While on stations, Flint can speak with various characters in order to get new missions and deepen the atmosphere of the game.\n\nThe former system of upgrading the vessel with a variety of defensive turrets has been simplified by fixing the player's view to the cockpit as well as permitting the usage of only two on-hull-installed cannons. As the result of this change, the controls of the submarine have been adapted to the first-person shooter's mouse-based layout, removing the need for the joystick, thus the game has compromised its tactical depth in order to increase the intensity of combat. This change has raised critique among the reviewers, stating that the developers' focus fell inadequately on the visual performance rather than the actual gameplay of its predecessor. {{quote|...But while ''Archimedean Dynasty'' was a complex, mission-based simulation with trading and privateering, ''AquaNox'' is an arcade-style action game that abandons or greatly simplifies those elements. Combat is fast paced and more similar in style to Quake's, or even a rail shooter's, than it is to the more tactical battles in other underwater sims.|{{cite news |last=Desslock |first= |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/aquanox/review.html |title=AquaNox Review |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2001-11-30}} }}\n\nThe game was one of the first applications to fully use the [[Transform, clipping, and lighting|T&L effects]] by supporting the ''[[NVIDIA]] Geforce 3 Ti'' graphics accelerator.{{quote|Considering the game engine has been used for months to market Nvidia's flagship GeForce 3 video card, it's no surprise that the graphics are outstanding.

Textures are colourful and extremely detailed, and there are numerous little graphical touches, such as chips that flake off underwater hills hit by your projectile weapons.|{{cite news |last=Desslock |first=  |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/aquanox/review.html?page=2 |title=AquaNox Review|publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2001-11-30}} }}\n\nThe game includes a vast amount of ''true'' information on oceans, such as origins of different species, their specifics and man's adaptation to submarine life. The game manual consists of two chapters explaining various terms and facts that have been mentioned throughout the course of the story.\n\n===''AquaNox 2: Revelation''===\n{{Infobox video game\n|title= AquaNox 2: Revelation\n|image= AquaNox 2.png\n|developer= [[Massive Development]]\n|publisher= [[Encore Software]], [[JoWooD Productions]]\n|released= 22 August 2003\n|genre= Futuristic Sub Sim\n|modes= [[Single player]]\n|platforms= [[Microsoft Windows]]\n}}\n\nThe plot of the game centers on William Drake, the last remnant of the old aristocratic, industrialist family. After the bankruptcy of the family business and the death of the protagonist's grandmother, young William Drake sets \"sail\" for open seas on the last freighter of Drake Enterprises. The cargo ship soon gets taken over by a group of mercenaries while Drake rushes out to answer a distress call. While sparing his life, the group of seven invaders seize control of the boat, thus binding Williams' fate to their own. Drake sees no other option but to ally himself with his new crew, hoping for the best.\n\nThe game features a total of four unique, playable and upgradeable gunships. The player most likely switches boats depending on a given mission's parameters. While certain missions require speed and stealth, others virtually require a heavy arsenal and thick plating. The game features a large variety of projectile armament as well as a set of torpedoes and a collection of directed energy weaponry, including lasers and [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] launchers. The torpedo combat is similar to the missile engagements of most flight simulators and space shooters, where the pilot is expected to release flares and perform classic evasion manoeuvres.\n\nTraveling is generally a simple matter of following the navigation points spread out through the game. The ship's controls can be switched from the [[First-person shooter|FPS]] mode to Simulation Mode via a predefined shortcut, where the latter steering scheme switches the horizontal scrolling of the mouse from turning the cockpit horizontally to rotating the hull around its axis. Reaching the surface is not possible due to the depth-range limitation, which binds the player to the underwater world yet gives certain disadvantages during combat.\n\nIn response to criticisms of poor interaction with other characters in AquaNox, a new dialogue system was added in the sequel. Between missions, the player is able to initiate conversations while on board the freighter as well as in the oceanic cities. The initiation of the conversations is mandatory. However, due to the absence of interaction during the dialogues, the outcome of the game is not open-ended. The dialogue and characters are the focus of many reviewers' ire, who criticize it as poorly-written and ultimately pointless.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gerstmann |first=Jeff |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/aquanox2revelation/review.html |title=Aquanox 2 Revelation Review|publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2003-09-29}}{{cite news |last=Deim |first=I. |url=http://www.gamershell.com/pc/aquanox_2_revelation/review.html |title=Aquanox 2 Revelation Review|publisher=Gamershell.com}}</ref>\n\n===''AquaNox: The Angel's Tears''===\n\n''AquaNox: The Angel's Tears'' is the [[PlayStation 2]] [[remake]] of ''AquaNox 2: Revelation''.
