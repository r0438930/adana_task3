The writings of Burroughs and [[Brion Gysin]] inspired his work with lettering and words. In 1980, he created headlines from word juxtaposition and attached hundreds to lamp-posts around Manhattan.

We traded a lot of works at that time.<ref name=\":1\" /> Andy Warhol mentions in his diaries going to the closing party on November 13, 1982, of the exhibition at Shafrazi.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Andy Warhol Diaries|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1989|isbn=978-0-446-51426-2|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nHaring died on February 16, 1990, of [[AIDS]]-related complications.<ref name=\"JOY\"/> He is among those commemorated in the [[AIDS Memorial Quilt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://festival.si.edu/blog/2012/keith-haring-in-the-aids-memorial-quilt/|title=Keith Haring in The AIDS Memorial Quilt \u2013 Smithsonian Folklife Festival}}</ref> As a celebration of his life, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] declared that the first New York date of her 1990 [[Blond Ambition World Tour]] would be a benefit concert for Haring's memory and donated all proceeds from her ticket sales to AIDS charities including [[AIDS Project Los Angeles]] and [[amfAR]]; the act was documented in her film ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare]].'' Additionally, his work was featured in several of [[Red Hot Organization]]'s efforts to raise money for AIDS and AIDS awareness, specifically its first two albums, ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' and ''[[Red Hot + Dance]]'', the latter of which used Haring's work on its cover.

The foundation's stated goal is to keep his wishes and expand his legacy by providing grants and funding to non-profit organizations that educate disadvantaged youths and inform the public about HIV and AIDS. It also shares his work and contains information about his life.<ref name=\"foundation\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.haring.com/kh_foundation/ |title=About the Keith Haring Foundation |website=www.haring.com|access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref> The foundation also supports arts and educational institutions by funding exhibitions, educational programs, and publications.<ref name=\"foundation\" />\n\n==Influences==\nHaring's work demonstrates political and personal influences. References to his sexual orientation are apparent throughout his work, and his journals confirm its impact on his work.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Haring |first1=Keith |title=Keith Haring journals |date=1996 |publisher=Viking |location=New York |isbn=978-0-670-84774-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/keithharingjourn00hari }}</ref> There are symbolic allusions to the AIDS epidemic in some of his later pieces, such as ''Untitled (cat. no. 27)'', ''Silence=Death'' and his sketch ''Weeping Woman''. In some of his works\u2014including cat. no. 27\u2014the symbolism is subtle, but he also produced some blatantly activist works. ''Silence=Death'', which mirrors the [[ACT UP]] poster and uses its motto, is almost universally agreed upon as a work of [[Activism|HIV/AIDS activism]].<ref name=\"Haring, Keith 2001\">Haring, Keith, [[G\u00f6tz Adriani]], and Ralph Melcher.

In a piece that he made with [[William Burroughs]], he depicts the virus as demon-like creatures, the number 666, and a mushroom cloud.<ref name=\"phillips\" />\n\nHaring's proximity to the nuclear meltdown at [[Three Mile Island]] had a large impact on him. His fear of nuclear disaster started to appear in his art. An example of this is a black and white striped flag that he said symbolized the danger of a nuclear apocalypse.<ref name=\"phillips\" />\n\nHaring was deeply influenced by the [[Jesus Movement]] as a youth, and it continued to play a role in his art for his entire career. The movement was an extremely [[evangelical]], loosely organized, diverse group of [[Christians]]. They were known for their [[Simple living|anti-materialism]] and anti-establishment beliefs, focus on the [[Last Judgement]], and their compassionate treatment of the poor. As a young teenager, Haring became very involved in the movement. Religious symbols started to be incorporated into his drawings around that age as well as Jesus Movement sentiments. This includes anti-church establishment views that can be seen in some of his later work.<ref name=\"phillips\" /> Though his time as a \"Jesus Person\" did not last beyond his teenage years, religious images, symbols, and references continued to appear in his art. In an interview near the end of his life he commented, \"[All] that stuff stuck in my head and even now there are lots of religious images in my work. Some people even think my work is by a religious fanatic or maniac.\"<ref name=\"phillips\" /> \n\nWhen he was a subway artist, Haring used a tag to sign his work. His tag (the Radiant Child) depicts a baby with lines radiating out of it, alluding to the [[Christ child]]. He continued to make images depicting the Christ child, including [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]] scenes in his characteristic style during his time as a subway artist.<ref name=\"phillips\" /> His last pieces were two religious triptychs; both went to [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] [[cathedrals]]. In them he illustrates the Last Judgement, though who is being saved in the pieces is ambiguous.<ref name=\"phillips\" />\n\n==Exhibitions==\nHaring contributed to the New York New Wave display in 1981 and in 1982, had his first exclusive exhibition in the [[Tony Shafrazi]] Gallery. That same year, he took part in [[Documenta]] 7 in [[Kassel]], [[Germany]], as well as [[Public Art Fund]]'s \"Messages to the Public\" in which he created work for a Spectacolor Board in [[Times Square]].<ref name=\"phillips\" /> He contributed work to the [[Whitney Biennial]] in 1983, as well as in the [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] [[S\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial|Biennial]]. In 1985, the [[CAPC mus\u00e9e d'art contemporain de Bordeaux|CAPC]] in [[Bordeaux]] opened an exhibition of his works, and he took part in the Paris Biennial.<ref name=\"BK16-17\"/>\n\nDuring his lifetime, Haring had over 50 one person shows, and, since his death, has been featured in over 150 exhibitions around the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Blinderman |first1=Barry |title=Keith Haring : Future Primeval. |date=1990 |publisher=University Galleries, Illinois State University |isbn=978-1-55859-378-7 |pages=60\u201372 }}</ref>\n\nHaring has been the subject of several international [[retrospective]]s.

In some of his works\u2014including cat. no. 27\u2014the symbolism is subtle, but he also produced some blatantly activist works.

In a piece that he made with [[William Burroughs]], he depicts the virus as demon-like creatures, the number 666, and a mushroom cloud.<ref name=\"phillips\" />\n\nHaring's proximity to the nuclear meltdown at [[Three Mile Island]] had a large impact on him. His fear of nuclear disaster started to appear in his art. An example of this is a black and white striped flag that he said symbolized the danger of a nuclear apocalypse.<ref name=\"phillips\" />\n\nHaring was deeply influenced by the [[Jesus Movement]] as a youth, and it continued to play a role in his art for his entire career. The movement was an extremely [[evangelical]], loosely organized, diverse group of [[Christians]]. They were known for their [[Simple living|anti-materialism]] and anti-establishment beliefs, focus on the [[Last Judgement]], and their compassionate treatment of the poor. As a young teenager, Haring became very involved in the movement. Religious symbols started to be incorporated into his drawings around that age as well as Jesus Movement sentiments. This includes anti-church establishment views that can be seen in some of his later work.<ref name=\"phillips\" /> Though his time as a \"Jesus Person\" did not last beyond his teenage years, religious images, symbols, and references continued to appear in his art. In an interview near the end of his life he commented, \"[All] that stuff stuck in my head and even now there are lots of religious images in my work. Some people even think my work is by a religious fanatic or maniac.\"<ref name=\"phillips\" /> \n\nWhen he was a subway artist, Haring used a tag to sign his work. His tag (the Radiant Child) depicts a baby with lines radiating out of it, alluding to the [[Christ child]]. He continued to make images depicting the Christ child, including [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]] scenes in his characteristic style during his time as a subway artist.<ref name=\"phillips\" /> His last pieces were two religious triptychs; both went to [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] [[cathedrals]]. In them he illustrates the Last Judgement, though who is being saved in the pieces is ambiguous.<ref name=\"phillips\" />\n\n==Exhibitions==\nHaring contributed to the New York New Wave display in 1981 and in 1982, had his first exclusive exhibition in the [[Tony Shafrazi]] Gallery. That same year, he took part in [[Documenta]] 7 in [[Kassel]], [[Germany]], as well as [[Public Art Fund]]'s \"Messages to the Public\" in which he created work for a Spectacolor Board in [[Times Square]].<ref name=\"phillips\" /> He contributed work to the [[Whitney Biennial]] in 1983, as well as in the [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] [[S\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial|Biennial]].
