Meanwhile, [[Lucius Vorenus (Rome character)|Vorenus]] returns to Rome with his rescued children. Secretly, the children wish to run away. The children steal some of Vorenus' money and run off to their aunt Lyde who insists that they return to their father and, at least, pretend to love and forgive him even after what he has done to their mother. Vorenus makes peace with his rival gangs at a great loss, but informs [[Titus Pullo (Rome character)|Pullo]] that even though the others may think they're \"going soft\", they will rebuild their forces. At an orgy, Agrippa abducts Octavia and returns her home to [[Atia of the Julii|Atia]]. After Atia fumes at Octavia for going to an orgy, [[Marcus Agrippa (Rome character)|Agrippa]] confesses his love for Octavia who is stunned as he walks out.\n\nOctavian, who had promised to heed Cicero's advice as consul, uses intimidation to pass a motion in the Senate declaring [[Marcus Junius Brutus (Rome character)|Brutus]] and Cassius enemies of the state. Cicero, mortified by Octavian's tactics and the fact he has, in his own words ''\"been outmaneuvered by a child\"'', sends a letter to Brutus, asking for help. In the east, Brutus is encouraged by the news, and plans to take advantage of the conflict between [[Mark Antony (Rome character)|Mark Antony]] and Octavian by letting them fight it out, and then returning to Rome just as their forces have dwindled. Cicero tells Octavian that Brutus is coming to Rome with \"20 legions\", which puts Octavian, who is left with 4 legions, in a dangerous position. Octavian must turn to his mother for help. Atia, accompanied by her son and his army, rides to Gaul, where she greets Mark Antony. She succeeds in convincing Mark Antony to become Octavian's ally, to ensure that they can defeat Brutus' approaching army.\n\nTitus Pullo swears to his wife, [[Eirene (Rome character)|Eirene]], who feels Pullo values his friendship with Vorenus over their marriage, that he would save her before Vorenus. As the friends and children sit down for dinner, Vorenus' eldest daughter Vorena gives out stew and thanks her father for his compliments. As the camera pans downward, we see her making the [[Corna]] (the \"horns\" hand gesture) behind her back, revealing her dishonesty.\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0901368/ \"Heroes of the Republic\"] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]\n\n{{Rome (TV series)}}\n\n[[Category:2007 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:2007 British television episodes]]\n[[Category:Rome (TV series) episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television episode\n| title        = Heroes of the Republic\n| series       = [[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| season       = 2\n| episode      = 5\n| writer       = [[Mere Smith]]\n| director     = [[Alik Sakharov]]\n| airdate      = February 11, 2007 ([[HBO]])<br />July 4, 2007 ([[BBC]])<!--\n-->{{Infobox|child=yes\n| label1 = Setting\n| data1  = [[Rome]]\n| label2 = Time frame\n| data2  = c. 43 BC\n}}\n| length       = \n| season_list  = \n| prev         = [[Testudo et Lepus (The Tortoise and the Hare)]]\n| next         = [[Philippi (Rome)|Philippi]]\n| episode_list = List of Rome episodes\n}}\n\n\"'''Heroes of the Republic'''\" is the fifth episode of the second season of the television series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]''.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nThe struggle in Rome continues as [[Gaius Octavian (Rome character)|Octavian]], the new Caesar, with his army at the city's borders, establishes himself as consul to the senate with the reluctant help of [[Marcus Tullius Cicero (Rome character)|Cicero]].
