As a footballer he played as an [[outside left]] and had a 16-year career in the [[English Football League|Football League]] from 1950 to 1966. He came from a footballing family: brother [[Jack Grainger (footballer, born 1924)|Jack Grainger]], brother-in-law [[Jim Iley]], and first cousins [[Dennis Grainger]], [[Jack Grainger (footballer, born 1912)|Jack Grainger]] and [[Edwin Holliday]] all played professionally. He got married in 1956 and has two children.\n\nRaised in the mining village of [[Havercroft]], he was working as a car mechanic when he was signed on apprentice forms at [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] club [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] in July 1949. He turned professional the following year and made his first-team debut in February 1951. Though [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]] prevented him from establishing himself at the club he still managed to build a reputation as an exciting young prospect and was purchased by [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] for a \u00a32,500 fee in June 1953. A regular in the starting eleven in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], he was called up for the first of his seven England caps in May 1956. His international career lasted just 11 months, though he did score two goals against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and one against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]. He was also twice selected for [[The Football League XI]].\n\nHis career then declined as he struggled with an ankle injury sustained on England duty and he was sold on to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] for \u00a317,000 plus [[Sam Kemp]] (valued at \u00a36,000) in February 1957. Sunderland were relegated out of the First Division at the end of the 1957\u201358 season and he was sold on to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] for a club record \u00a315,000 in July 1960. His damaged ankle hindered his form at Leeds and he was sold on to [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] side [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in October 1961 for \u00a36,000. He helped Vale to knock former club Sunderland out of the [[FA Cup]] the [[1957\u201358 FA Cup|following January]], but missed the end of the season with a groin injury that dogged him for the remainder of his time at [[Vale Park]]. He was not retained at the end of the 1963\u201364 season and signed with [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] side [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in August 1964. He made 41 appearances across the 1964\u201365 campaign, though was dropped the following season and was released in summer 1966. He then had a brief spell with [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] in the [[Cheshire County League]], before retiring to focus on his singing career. He later spent 1969 to 1972 as [[Player-coach|player-manager]] of non-league village team Newmillerdam, before playing for [[Woolley Miners Welfare F.C.|Woolley Miners Welfare]] in the [[Yorkshire Football League|Yorkshire League]] from 1972 to 1978.\n\nGrainger performed his first professional music [[Gig (music)|gig]] in 1956, supporting the [[The Hilltoppers (band)|Hilltoppers]]. He appeared on television and radio, and also had a ghostwritten column in the ''Sport Express''. He was signed with the [[HMV]] label and released \"This I Know\"/\"Are You\" as a single in 1958. His footballing career restricted his singing opportunities, though he did share a bill with the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] in June 1963. He ended his singing career in August 1970 in order to focus on his new career in sales. He also supplemented his income [[Scout (association football)|scouting]] for a succession of clubs: [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], Leeds United, [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] and Sheffield United.\n\n==Early and personal life==\nBorn in the mining village of [[Havercroft]] on 10 June 1933, his father \u2013 Daniel Grainger (1894\u20131967) \u2013 was a coal miner at Monckton Colliery.<ref>{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=3}}</ref> He had five older brothers: Leslie (born 1920), George (born 1922), [[Jack Grainger (footballer, born 1924)|Jack]] (born 1924), Eric (born 1926) and Horace (born 1929), though Leslie and George both died before he was born.<ref name=\"page 5\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=5}}</ref> His mother, Lily Grainger (n\u00e9e Holliday; 1900\u201379), gave birth to a total of seven children, with the one daughter also named Lily (born 1935).<ref name=\"page 5\"/> He represented Barnsley boys' team during the 1946\u201347 season, alongside future [[Munich air disaster]] victim [[Tommy Taylor]] and [[Umpire (cricket)|cricket umpire]] [[Dickie Bird]].<ref name=\"page 17\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=17}}</ref> He attended Ryhill Junior, Ryhill Middle School, and then Felkirk Secondary School.<ref name=\"page 11\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=11}}</ref> After leaving school at the age of 15, he was employed as a car mechanic on wages that initially started on \u00a31-a-week.<ref name=\"page 19\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=19}}</ref>\n\nGrainger came from a footballing family and his younger brother, Jack, spent ten years at [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] just after [[World War II]].<ref name=\"page 1\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=1}}</ref> His younger sister, Lily, went on to marry [[Jim Iley]], who played as a [[wing-half]] for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].<ref name=\"page 2\"/> His cousin, also named [[Jack Grainger (footballer, born 1912)|Jack Grainger]], played in the [[English Football League|Football League]] for [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] and [[Southport F.C.|Southport]] in the 1930s.<ref name=\"page 1\"/> Jack's younger brother, [[Dennis Grainger|Dennis]], played for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] in the late 1940s.<ref name=\"page 1\"/> Another cousin, [[Edwin Holliday]], went on to represent [[England national football team|England]] whilst playing for [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in 1959.<ref name=\"page 2\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=2}}</ref>\n\nGrainger married Doreen Rowe on 3 January 1956.<ref name=\"page 50\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=50}}</ref> They had a son, Colin Junior, born on 3 July 1956.<ref name=\"page 69\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=69}}</ref> A daughter, Kim, followed on 27 February 1964.<ref name=\"page 172\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=172}}</ref> Grainger wrote his autobiography, ''The Singing Winger'', which was published by deCoubertin Books on 17 October 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Singing Winger |url=https://www.decoubertin.co.uk/Grainger |website=deCoubertin Books |accessdate=7 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n===Wrexham===\nGrainger spent his youth with South Elmsall Boys, before being invited for a trial at Wrexham in July 1949.<ref name=\"page 19\"/> He impressed Wrexham manager [[Les McDowall]] enough to earn a professional footballing apprenticeship on wages of \u00a35-a-week.<ref name=\"page 19\"/> He spent the [[1949\u201350 in English football|1949\u201350 season]] playing for the reserve team in the [[Cheshire County League]].<ref name=\"page 22\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=22}}</ref> McDowall moved on to manage [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in June 1950 and invited Grainger to take a tour of [[Maine Road]] in an attempt to poach him away from Wrexham, an attempt that was thwarted when the Wrexham board heard of the news and reassured Grainger that he would be sold on to a bigger club if he first proved himself at Wrexham.<ref name=\"page 23\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=23}}</ref> However he was called up for [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]] in 1951 and spent the next two years serving in the [[Royal Air Force]].<ref name=\"page 23\"/> He turned professional with Wrexham on his 17th-birthday, seeing an increase in wages to \u00a38-a-week, in addition to a \u00a310 signing-on fee.<ref name=\"page 25\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=25}}</ref> He made his first-team debut on 24 February 1951, taking [[Billy Tunnicliffe]]'s spot at outside-left in a [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] match against [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepools United]] at the [[Racecourse Ground]], which ended in a 1\u20130 home victory.<ref name=\"page 25\"/> His National Service limited his first-team chances under manager [[Peter Jackson (footballer, born 1905)|Peter Jackson]], and he failed to make an appearance in the [[1951\u201352 Wrexham A.F.C. season|1951\u201352]] season, before playing just four games of the [[1952\u201353 Wrexham A.F.C. season|1952\u201353]] campaign.<ref name=\"page 27\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=27}}</ref>\n\n===Sheffield United===\nOn 27 June 1953, Grainger was signed by [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] champions Sheffield United for a fee of \u00a32,500.<ref name=\"page 30\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=30}}</ref> United manager [[Reg Freeman]] had signed his brother Jack at Rotherham United six years previously.<ref name=\"page 30\"/> He was placed on the [[maximum wage]] of \u00a320-a-week and received a \u00a310 signing-on fee.<ref name=\"page 32\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=32}}</ref> Demobbed from National Service in October, he made his first-team debut in a 1\u20131 draw with [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] at [[Bramall Lane]] on 14 November, taking the place of [[Derek Hawksworth]] at outside-left.<ref name=\"page 36\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=36}}</ref> He played with his wrist in plaster as he suffered a fracture just before his demobilisation.<ref name=\"page 37\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=37}}</ref> He featured in only two further [[Football League First Division|First Division]] matches in the [[1953\u201354 Sheffield United F.C. season|1953\u201354]] season.<ref name=\"page 40\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=40}}</ref>\n\nHe scored his first goal in the Football League in a 4\u20131 home win over Tottenham Hotspur on 30 October 1954, having got the better of right-back [[Alf Ramsey]], with one journalist reporting that \"Ramsey never even attempted to match [Grainger] in speed\".<ref name=\"page 43\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=43}}</ref> He scored his second goal for the \"Blades\" in a 3\u20130 home win over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] two weeks later, this time getting the better of right-back [[Bill Foulkes]].<ref name=\"page 43\"/> United went on to secure their First Division status with a 2\u20131 victory at [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on 30 April, with Grainger scoring one of the goals.<ref name=\"page 45\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=45}}</ref> Another goal on the final day of the [[1954\u201355 Sheffield United F.C. season|1954\u201355]] season took his tally to six goals in 25 appearances and helped to secure a 5\u20132 win over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] to leave United 13th in the table.<ref name=\"page 45\"/>\n\nFreeman died of cancer in August 1955 and the team struggled at the start of the [[1955\u201356 Sheffield United F.C. season|1955\u201356]] campaign.<ref name=\"page 48\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=48}}</ref> However Grainger scored both goals in a 2\u20130 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur on 5 September, providing [[Joe Mercer]] his first win as a manager.<ref name=\"page 48\"/> He impressed [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] manager [[Arthur Turner (footballer, born 1909)|Arthur Turner]] sufficiently in a 2\u20130 Christmas Eve victory that Mercer was forced to rejected a transfer offer, as he told the press that \"The answer [to enquiries for Grainger] will always be the same: no!\"<ref name=\"page 51\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=51}}</ref> However United struggled in the second half of the season and were relegated with a 3\u20131 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on 28 April, Grainger scoring United's goal before centre-back [[Howard Johnson (footballer)|Howard Johnson]] was forced off with injury to leave United with only ten men.<ref name=\"page 54\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=54}}</ref>\n\nUnited opened the [[1956\u201357 Sheffield United F.C. season|1956\u201357]] Second Division campaign away at Rotherham United, the first match where the two Grainger brothers would play on opposite teams, and it was the away side who claimed a 4\u20130 victory, with Grainger scoring two goals.<ref name=\"page 69\"/> As an England international playing in the second tier he found the league relatively easy, and on 1 September he secured his first career hat-trick in a 6\u20131 win at Barnsley after taking the bus to [[Oakwell]] as it was near the family home in Havercroft.<ref name=\"page 70\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=70}}</ref> However an injury picked up on England duty caused him to miss six weeks going into the new year and upon his recovery Mercer informed him that the club's directors had ordered him to sell Grainger for the best possible price as quickly as possible.<ref name=\"page 73\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=73}}</ref> [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] made an offer of \u00a323,000, but could not pay the full amount immediately, and so Sheffield United instead accepted an offer of \u00a317,000 plus [[Sam Kemp]] (valued at \u00a36,000) from [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].<ref name=\"page 75\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=75}}</ref> Grainger was firmly against the move, but the Sheffield United board of directors were determined to bring in a large fee to pay off creditors and Mercer illegally handed him \u00a3300 as recompense.<ref name=\"page 76\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=76}}</ref>\n\n===Sunderland===\nGrainger's arrival at Sunderland's [[Roker Park]] in February 1957 came at a difficult time as [[Bill Murray (footballer, born 1901)|Bill Murray]]'s 18-year reign as manager was coming to an end.<ref name=\"page 79\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=79}}</ref> The club was freely spending money, paying out \u00a322,000 for [[Don Revie]] in addition to the \u00a323,000 fee for Grainger, but were struggling near the bottom of the First Division.<ref name=\"page 79\"/> Sunderland spent the second half of the [[1956\u201357 Sunderland A.F.C. season|1956\u201357]] season in the bottom four and lost their final three matches, but avoided relegation as they ended the season one position and three points ahead of relegated [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].<ref name=\"page 85\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=85}}</ref> Sunderland were also charged by [[The Football Association]] with making illegal payments to players and chairman Bill Ditchburn was handed a lifetime ban from football whilst the club were fined \u00a35,000 and Murray resigned his post.<ref name=\"page 85\"/>\n\nMurray's successor as manager, [[Alan Brown (English footballer)|Alan Brown]], alienated senior players such as [[Billy Bingham]], Don Revie and [[Len Shackleton]], leaving Grainger to later comment that \"Brown's presence had created discordance out of harmony, anxiety out of tranquillity\" and \"football felt like work and training felt like prison\".<ref name=\"page 97\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=97}}</ref> Having been dropped to the reserves a month in the [[1957\u201358 Sunderland A.F.C. season|1957\u201358]] season, Grainger and goalkeeper [[Ray Daniel (Welsh footballer)|Ray Daniel]] requested transfers.<ref name=\"page 98\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=98}}</ref> However he stayed on [[Wearside]] and despite beating Portsmouth on the last day of the season, Sunderland occupied the final relegation place after finishing level on points with Portsmouth but with an inferior goal average; it was the first relegation in [[History of Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland's history]] since they became founder members of the Football League in [[1890\u201391 Sunderland A.F.C. season|1890]] and was the last time Grainger would play in the top-flight.<ref name=\"page 105\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=105}}</ref>\n\nGrainger scored the club's first goal in the Second Division on 23 August 1958, in a 3\u20131 defeat at [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]].<ref name=\"page 110\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=110}}</ref> He broke his collarbone in a 1\u20130 win over [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], causing him to miss five matches at a crucial time when his form was good and he was being considered again for the England squad.<ref name=\"page 113\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=113}}</ref> He totalled three goals from 37 games in the [[1958\u201359 Sunderland A.F.C. season|1958\u201359]] campaign, finding that he gelled well with new signing [[Ernie Taylor (footballer, born 1925)|Ernie Taylor]].<ref name=\"page 113\"/>\n\nHe played 41 of the club's 42 league matches in the [[1959\u201360 Sunderland A.F.C. season|1959\u201360]] season, missing only a trip to [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] on 2 January, but Sunderland laboured to a 16th-place finish.<ref name=\"page 116\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=116}}</ref> Grainger become further disillusioned and handed in a transfer request after the board of directors rejected his request of a loan in order to invest in a [[newsagent's shop]] in [[South Shields]].<ref name=\"page 117\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=117}}</ref> He refused to play any matches for Sunderland in the [[1960\u201361 Sunderland A.F.C. season|1960\u201361]] season, leaving him labelled as a \"rebel footballer\" in the press, whilst [[Stan Anderson]], Ernie Taylor, [[Alan O'Neill (footballer, born 1937)|Alan O'Neill]] and [[Reg Pearce]] also demanded interviews with the board of directors to voice their dissatisfaction in the running of the club.<ref name=\"page 118\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=118}}</ref>\n\n===Leeds United===\nGrainger was sold to Leeds United for a [[List of Leeds United F.C. records and statistics|club record]] fee of \u00a315,000 in July 1960, a team that had just been relegated into the Second Division, and he was given an illegal signing-on fee.<ref name=\"page 120\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=120}}</ref> Manager [[Jack Taylor (footballer, born 1914)|Jack Taylor]] freed him of any defensive responsibilities, with left-back [[Grenville Hair]] fit and competent enough to not need any assistance from his outside-left.<ref name=\"page 129\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=129}}</ref> However Grainger was not able to take full advantage of this tactic as his right ankle had deteriorated to the point that it needed heavy strapping and he suffered a lack of speed and confidence as a result.<ref name=\"page 129\"/> He did though show promising form early into his brief time at [[Elland Road]], scoring his first goal for the club in his fourth game, a 4\u20134 draw at [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]],  following up with his second goal five days later in a 4\u20132 win at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].<ref name=\"page 130\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=130}}</ref> With the maximum wage abolished in January 1961, he signed a new contract of \u00a320-a-week.<ref name=\"page 135\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=135}}</ref> Don Revie succeeded Jack Taylor as manager in March and Grainger was in the starting eleven for Revie's first game as manager, a 3\u20131 loss at Charlton Athletic.<ref name=\"page 138\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=138}}</ref> However he was dropped after suffering a knee injury and then worsened the injury in a reserve team game against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]].<ref name=\"page 139\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=139}}</ref> A surgeon discovered tissue damage underneath the kneecap and removed the cartilage, leaving Grainger to recover over the summer.<ref name=\"page 140\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=140}}</ref> He was still out of action at the start of the [[1960\u201361 Leeds United F.C. season|1960\u201361]] campaign, and with the club desperate for funds and [[Albert Johanneson]] performing well in his absence, Revie made Grainger available for transfer.<ref name=\"page 142\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=142}}</ref>\n\n===Port Vale===\nGrainger signed with [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] side [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] when manager [[Norman Low]] paid \u00a36,000 for his services in October 1961.<ref

As a footballer he played as an [[outside left]] and had a 16-year career in the [[English Football League|Football League]] from 1950 to 1966. He came from a footballing family: brother [[Jack Grainger (footballer, born 1924)|Jack Grainger]], brother-in-law [[Jim Iley]], and first cousins [[Dennis Grainger]], [[Jack Grainger (footballer, born 1912)|Jack Grainger]] and [[Edwin Holliday]] all played professionally. He got married in 1956 and has two children.\n\nRaised in the mining village of [[Havercroft]], he was working as a car mechanic when he was signed on apprentice forms at [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] club [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] in July 1949. He turned professional the following year and made his first-team debut in February 1951. Though [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]] prevented him from establishing himself at the club he still managed to build a reputation as an exciting young prospect and was purchased by [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] for a \u00a32,500 fee in June 1953. A regular in the starting eleven in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], he was called up for the first of his seven England caps in May 1956. His international career lasted just 11 months, though he did score two goals against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and one against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]. He was also twice selected for [[The Football League XI]].\n\nHis career then declined as he struggled with an ankle injury sustained on England duty and he was sold on to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] for \u00a317,000 plus [[Sam Kemp]] (valued at \u00a36,000) in February 1957. Sunderland were relegated out of the First Division at the end of the 1957\u201358 season and he was sold on to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] for a club record \u00a315,000 in July 1960. His damaged ankle hindered his form at Leeds and he was sold on to [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] side [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in October 1961 for \u00a36,000. He helped Vale to knock former club Sunderland out of the [[FA Cup]] the [[1957\u201358 FA Cup|following January]], but missed the end of the season with a groin injury that dogged him for the remainder of his time at [[Vale Park]]. He was not retained at the end of the 1963\u201364 season and signed with [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] side [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in August 1964. He made 41 appearances across the 1964\u201365 campaign, though was dropped the following season and was released in summer 1966. He then had a brief spell with [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] in the [[Cheshire County League]], before retiring to focus on his singing career. He later spent 1969 to 1972 as [[Player-coach|player-manager]] of non-league village team Newmillerdam, before playing for [[Woolley Miners Welfare F.C.|Woolley Miners Welfare]] in the [[Yorkshire Football League|Yorkshire League]] from 1972 to 1978.\n\nGrainger performed his first professional music [[Gig (music)|gig]] in 1956, supporting the [[The Hilltoppers (band)|Hilltoppers]]. He appeared on television and radio, and also had a ghostwritten column in the ''Sport Express''. He was signed with the [[HMV]] label and released \"This I Know\"/\"Are You\" as a single in 1958. His footballing career restricted his singing opportunities, though he did share a bill with the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] in June 1963. He ended his singing career in August 1970 in order to focus on his new career in sales. He also supplemented his income [[Scout (association football)|scouting]] for a succession of clubs: [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], Leeds United, [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] and Sheffield United.\n\n==Early and personal life==\nBorn in the mining village of [[Havercroft]] on 10 June 1933, his father \u2013 Daniel Grainger (1894\u20131967) \u2013 was a coal miner at Monckton Colliery.<ref>{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=3}}</ref> He had five older brothers: Leslie (born 1920), George (born 1922), [[Jack Grainger (footballer, born 1924)|Jack]] (born 1924), Eric (born 1926) and Horace (born 1929), though Leslie and George both died before he was born.<ref name=\"page 5\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=5}}</ref> His mother, Lily Grainger (n\u00e9e Holliday; 1900\u201379), gave birth to a total of seven children, with the one daughter also named Lily (born 1935).<ref name=\"page 5\"/> He represented Barnsley boys' team during the 1946\u201347 season, alongside future [[Munich air disaster]] victim [[Tommy Taylor]] and [[Umpire (cricket)|cricket umpire]] [[Dickie Bird]].<ref name=\"page

school at the age of 15, he was employed as a car mechanic on wages that initially started on \u00a31-a-week.<ref name=\"page 19\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=19}}</ref>\n\nGrainger came from a footballing family and his younger brother, Jack, spent ten years at [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] just after [[World War II]].<ref name=\"page 1\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=1}}</ref> His younger sister, Lily, went on to marry [[Jim Iley]], who played as a [[wing-half]] for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].<ref name=\"page 2\"/> His cousin, also named [[Jack Grainger (footballer, born 1912)|Jack Grainger]], played in the [[English Football League|Football League]] for [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] and [[Southport F.C.|Southport]] in the 1930s.<ref name=\"page 1\"/> Jack's younger brother, [[Dennis Grainger|Dennis]], played for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] in the late 1940s.<ref name=\"page 1\"/> Another cousin, [[Edwin Holliday]], went on to represent [[England national football team|England]] whilst playing for [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in 1959.<ref name=\"page 2\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=2}}</ref>\n\nGrainger married Doreen Rowe on 3 January 1956.<ref name=\"page 50\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=50}}</ref> They had a son, Colin Junior, born on 3 July 1956.<ref name=\"page 69\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=69}}</ref> A daughter, Kim, followed on 27 February 1964.<ref name=\"page

Elmsall Boys, before being invited for a trial at Wrexham in July 1949.<ref name=\"page 19\"/> He impressed Wrexham manager [[Les McDowall]] enough to earn a professional footballing apprenticeship on wages of \u00a35-a-week.<ref name=\"page 19\"/> He spent the [[1949\u201350 in English football|1949\u201350 season]] playing for the reserve team in the [[Cheshire County League]].<ref name=\"page 22\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=22}}</ref> McDowall moved on to manage [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in June 1950 and invited Grainger to take a tour of [[Maine Road]] in an attempt to poach him away from Wrexham, an attempt that was thwarted when the Wrexham board heard of the news and reassured Grainger that he would be sold on to a bigger club if he first proved himself at Wrexham.<ref name=\"page 23\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=23}}</ref> However he was called up for [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]] in 1951 and spent the next two years serving in the [[Royal Air Force]].<ref name=\"page 23\"/> He turned professional with Wrexham on his 17th-birthday, seeing an increase in wages to \u00a38-a-week, in addition to a \u00a310 signing-on fee.<ref name=\"page 25\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=25}}</ref> He made his first-team debut on 24 February 1951, taking [[Billy Tunnicliffe]]'s spot at outside-left in a [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] match against [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepools United]] at the [[Racecourse Ground]], which ended in a 1\u20130 home victory.<ref name=\"page 25\"/> His National Service limited his first-team chances under manager [[Peter Jackson (footballer, born 1905)|Peter Jackson]], and he failed to make an appearance in the [[1951\u201352 Wrexham A.F.C. season|1951\u201352]] season, before playing just four games of the [[1952\u201353 Wrexham A.F.C. season|1952\u201353]] campaign.<ref name=\"page 27\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=27}}</ref>\n\n===Sheffield United===\nOn 27 June 1953, Grainger was signed by [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] champions Sheffield United for a fee of \u00a32,500.<ref name=\"page 30\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=30}}</ref> United manager [[Reg Freeman]] had signed his brother Jack at Rotherham United six years previously.<ref name=\"page 30\"/> He was placed on the [[maximum wage]] of \u00a320-a-week and received a \u00a310 signing-on fee.<ref name=\"page 32\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=32}}</ref> Demobbed from National Service in October, he made his first-team debut in a 1\u20131 draw with [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] at [[Bramall Lane]] on 14 November, taking the place of [[Derek Hawksworth]] at outside-left.<ref name=\"page 36\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=36}}</ref> He played with his wrist in plaster as he suffered a fracture just before his demobilisation.<ref name=\"page 37\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=37}}</ref> He featured in only two further [[Football League First Division|First Division]] matches in the [[1953\u201354 Sheffield United F.C. season|1953\u201354]] season.<ref name=\"page 40\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=40}}</ref>\n\nHe scored his first goal in the Football League in a 4\u20131 home win over Tottenham Hotspur on 30 October 1954, having got the better of right-back [[Alf Ramsey]], with one journalist reporting that \"Ramsey never even attempted to match [Grainger] in speed\".<ref name=\"page 43\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=43}}</ref> He scored his second goal for the \"Blades\" in a 3\u20130 home win over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] two weeks later, this time getting the better of right-back [[Bill Foulkes]].<ref name=\"page 43\"/> United went on to secure their First Division status with a 2\u20131 victory at [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on 30 April, with Grainger scoring one of the goals.<ref name=\"page 45\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=45}}</ref> Another goal on the final day of the [[1954\u201355 Sheffield United F.C. season|1954\u201355]] season took his tally to six goals in 25 appearances and helped to secure a 5\u20132 win over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] to leave United 13th in the table.<ref name=\"page 45\"/>\n\nFreeman died of cancer in August 1955 and the team struggled at the start of the [[1955\u201356 Sheffield United F.C. season|1955\u201356]] campaign.<ref name=\"page 48\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=48}}</ref> However Grainger scored both goals in a 2\u20130 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur on 5 September, providing [[Joe Mercer]] his first win as a manager.<ref name=\"page 48\"/> He impressed [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] manager [[Arthur Turner (footballer, born 1909)|Arthur Turner]] sufficiently in a 2\u20130 Christmas Eve victory that Mercer was forced to rejected a transfer offer, as he told the press that \"The answer [to enquiries for Grainger] will always be the same: no!\"<ref name=\"page 51\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=51}}</ref> However United struggled in the second half of the season and were relegated with a 3\u20131 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on 28 April, Grainger scoring United's goal before centre-back [[Howard Johnson (footballer)|Howard Johnson]] was forced off with injury to leave United with only ten men.<ref name=\"page 54\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=54}}</ref>\n\nUnited opened the [[1956\u201357 Sheffield United F.C. season|1956\u201357]] Second Division campaign away at Rotherham United, the first match where the two Grainger brothers would play on opposite teams, and it was the away side who claimed a 4\u20130 victory, with Grainger scoring two goals.<ref name=\"page 69\"/> As an England international playing in the second tier he found the league relatively easy, and on 1 September he secured his first career hat-trick in a 6\u20131 win at Barnsley after taking the bus to [[Oakwell]] as it was near the family home in Havercroft.<ref name=\"page 70\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=70}}</ref> However an injury picked up on England duty caused him to miss six weeks going into the new year and upon his recovery Mercer informed him that the club's directors had ordered him to sell Grainger for the best possible price as quickly as possible.<ref name=\"page 73\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=73}}</ref> [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] made an offer of \u00a323,000, but could not pay the full amount immediately, and so Sheffield United instead accepted an offer of \u00a317,000 plus [[Sam Kemp]] (valued at \u00a36,000) from [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].<ref name=\"page

illegally handed him \u00a3300 as recompense.<ref name=\"page 76\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=76}}</ref>\n\n===Sunderland===\nGrainger's arrival at Sunderland's [[Roker Park]] in February 1957 came at a difficult time as [[Bill Murray (footballer, born 1901)|Bill Murray]]'s 18-year reign as manager was coming to an end.<ref name=\"page 79\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=79}}</ref> The club was freely spending money, paying out \u00a322,000 for [[Don Revie]] in addition to the \u00a323,000 fee for Grainger, but were struggling near the bottom of the First Division.<ref name=\"page 79\"/> Sunderland spent the second half of the [[1956\u201357 Sunderland A.F.C. season|1956\u201357]] season in the bottom four and lost their final three matches, but avoided relegation as they ended the season one position and three points ahead of relegated [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].<ref name=\"page 85\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=85}}</ref> Sunderland were also charged by [[The Football Association]] with making illegal payments to players and chairman Bill Ditchburn was handed a lifetime ban from football whilst the club were fined \u00a35,000 and Murray resigned his post.<ref name=\"page 85\"/>\n\nMurray's successor as manager, [[Alan Brown (English footballer)|Alan Brown]], alienated senior players such as [[Billy Bingham]], Don Revie and [[Len Shackleton]], leaving Grainger to later comment that \"Brown's presence had created discordance out of harmony, anxiety out of tranquillity\" and \"football felt like work and training felt like prison\".<ref name=\"page

footballer)|Ray Daniel]] requested transfers.<ref name=\"page 98\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=98}}</ref> However he stayed on [[Wearside]] and despite beating Portsmouth on the last day of the season, Sunderland occupied the final relegation place after finishing level on points with Portsmouth but with an inferior goal average; it was the first relegation in [[History of Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland's history]] since they became founder members of the Football League in [[1890\u201391 Sunderland A.F.C. season|1890]] and was the last time Grainger would play in the top-flight.<ref name=\"page 105\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=105}}</ref>\n\nGrainger scored the club's first goal in the Second Division on 23 August 1958, in a 3\u20131 defeat at [[Lincoln City

matches at a crucial time when his form was good and he was being considered again for the England squad.<ref name=\"page 113\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=113}}</ref> He totalled three goals from 37 games in the [[1958\u201359 Sunderland A.F.C. season|1958\u201359]] campaign, finding that he gelled well with new signing [[Ernie Taylor (footballer, born 1925)|Ernie Taylor]].<ref name=\"page

Albion]] on 2 January, but Sunderland laboured to a 16th-place finish.<ref name=\"page 116\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=116}}</ref> Grainger become further disillusioned and handed in a transfer request after the board of directors rejected his request of a loan in order to invest in a [[newsagent's shop]] in [[South Shields]].<ref name=\"page 117\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=117}}</ref> He refused to play any matches for Sunderland in the [[1960\u201361 Sunderland A.F.C. season|1960\u201361]] season, leaving him labelled as a \"rebel footballer\" in the press, whilst [[Stan Anderson]], Ernie Taylor, [[Alan O'Neill (footballer, born 1937)|Alan O'Neill]] and [[Reg Pearce]] also demanded interviews with the board of directors to voice their dissatisfaction in the running of the club.<ref

\u00a315,000 in July 1960, a team that had just been relegated into the Second Division, and he was given an illegal signing-on fee.<ref name=\"page 120\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=120}}</ref> Manager [[Jack Taylor (footballer, born 1914)|Jack Taylor]] freed him of any defensive responsibilities, with left-back [[Grenville Hair]] fit and competent enough to not need any assistance from his outside-left.<ref name=\"page 129\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=129}}</ref> However Grainger was not able to take full advantage of this tactic as his right ankle had deteriorated to the point that it needed heavy strapping and he suffered a lack of speed and confidence as a result.<ref name=\"page 129\"/> He did though show promising form early into his brief time at [[Elland Road]], scoring his first goal for the club in his fourth game, a 4\u20134 draw at [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]],  following up with his second goal five days later in a 4\u20132 win at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].<ref name=\"page 130\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=130}}</ref> With the maximum wage abolished in January 1961, he signed a new contract of \u00a320-a-week.<ref name=\"page 135\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=135}}</ref> Don Revie succeeded Jack Taylor as manager in March and Grainger was in the starting eleven for Revie's first game as manager, a 3\u20131 loss at Charlton Athletic.<ref name=\"page 138\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=138}}</ref> However he was dropped after suffering a knee injury and then worsened the injury in a reserve team game against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]].<ref name=\"page 139\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=139}}</ref> A surgeon discovered tissue damage underneath the kneecap and removed the cartilage, leaving Grainger to recover over the summer.<ref name=\"page 140\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=140}}</ref> He was still out of action at the start of the [[1960\u201361 Leeds United F.C. season|1960\u201361]] campaign, and with the club desperate for funds and [[Albert Johanneson]] performing well in his absence, Revie made Grainger available for transfer.<ref name=\"page 142\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=142}}</ref>\n\n===Port Vale===\nGrainger signed with [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] side [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] when manager [[Norman Low]] paid \u00a36,000 for his services in October 1961.<ref

willing to pay the \u00a36,000 fee, but refused to pay a signing-on fee, whilst Port Vale offered Grainger wages of \u00a330-a-week with bonuses and a \u00a3300 signing-on fee as they wanted to match [[Potteries derby]] rivals [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]'s ambition in re-signing [[Stanley Matthews]].<ref name=\"page 143\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=143}}</ref> His debut was described as a 'triumphant' one as he scored in a 4\u20131 win over [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] at [[Vale Park]] on 21 October.<ref name=\"kent\"/> On 27 January, he helped his new team to a 0\u20130 draw at former club Sunderland in the [[FA Cup]] fourth round and before the match gave his teammates [[placebo]] pills in order to boost their confidence.<ref name=\"page

for or against Sunderland.<ref name=\"page 150\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=150}}</ref> The club failed to replicate this form in the league however and Grainger picked up a groin injury during one of coach [[Eric Jones (footballer, born 1915)|Eric Jones]]'s notoriously strenuous fitness sessions.<ref name=\"page 151\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=151}}</ref> He took a [[cortisone]] injection to get him through the fifth round defeat at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on 17 February and then ruled himself out of action for the rest of the [[1961\u201362 Port Vale F.C. season|1961\u201362]] season; Vale went on to end the campaign in a disappointing 12th-position.<ref name=\"page 154\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=154}}</ref>\n\nLow preferred [[Stan Edwards (footballer, born 1942)|Stan Edwards]] at outside-left at the start of the [[1962\u201363 Port Vale F.C. season|1962\u201363]] campaign, but Grainger was returned to the starting line-up for the third match of the season, and scored in a 2\u20130 win over [[Reading F.C.|Reading]].<ref name=\"page 161\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=161}}</ref> A harshly cold winter known as the \"[[Winter of 1962\u201363 in the United Kingdom|Big Freeze]]\" savaged the footballing season and Vale went from 22 December to 2 March without fulfilling a league fixture; however this aided Grainger as he was able to rest and heal his groin problem rather than rely on cortisone injections to mask the pain.<ref name=\"page 163\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=163}}</ref> He was however in conflict with new manager [[Freddie Steele (footballer)|Freddie Steele]], who told him the pain in his groin was just psychological.<ref name=\"page 163\"/> The Big Freeze's resulting fixture congestion was too much for Grainger to cope with and he again injured his groin in a 2\u20131 defeat to Barnsley on 29 March and could only feature in three of the club's final fifteen games as Vale went on to finish in third-place, four points shy of a promotion spot.<ref name=\"page 165\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=165}}</ref>\n\nHe started the opening game of the [[1963\u201364 Port Vale F.C. season|1963\u201364]] season, a 1\u20130 defeat at [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]], but then missed the next seven months due to his groin injury, and [[Ron Smith (footballer, born 1936)|Ron Smith]] was signed as a long-term replacement on the left-wing.<ref name=\"page 170\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=170}}</ref> Grainger played two games in March and then again returned to reserve team football.<ref name=\"page 172\"/> He was not offered a

having been signed by outgoing manager [[Oscar Hold]] on \u00a330-a-week wages and a \u00a31,000 signing-on fee.<ref name=\"page 174\"/> Whilst training with Barnsley over the summer, chairman Joe Richards had offered to match Doncaster's contract offer, but Grainger declined as he already had a verbal agreement with Doncaster.<ref name=\"page 176\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=176}}</ref> New

manage his groin injury well enough to make 41 appearances throughout the campaign.<ref name=\"page 183\">{{harvnb|Grainger|2019|p=183}}</ref> This was despite his reputation as a former England international bringing him rough treatment from opposition defenders, so much so that he reacted to Brighton & Hove Albion winger [[Wally Gould]]'s late tackles by punching Gould in the face, earning himself a red card and 21 day suspension.<ref name=\"page 183\"/> He then lost his first-team place at [[Belle Vue (football)|Belle Vue]] and featured just six times during the [[1965\u201366 Doncaster Rovers F.C. season|1965\u201366]] season, but turned down an offer from Football League chairman [[Alan Hardaker]] to represent Irish club [[Drumcondra F.C.|Drumcondra]] in the [[UEFA
