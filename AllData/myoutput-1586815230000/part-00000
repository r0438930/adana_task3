First, the excess demand due to the pandemic.  Second, the specialised nature of care of the critically ill and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of protective equipment (PPE). The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death. This last case applies across the health system and makes it harder to draw staff from non-COVID health workers.\n\nMitigations being used include recruiting military and sports medics, final-year doctors in training, private sector staff, and re-recruiting retired staff and those who have moved from the medical sector.\n\nFor non-medical roles staff have been recruited from other sectors.\n\n=== Patients overload===\nFacing the prospect of an unmanageable influx of patients both in his city and in others across the United States, [[New York City]] mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] called on the [[U.S. federal government]] to recruit additional medical staff to help meet demand.

Initially, much of this was blamed on panic buying. Consumers began fearing both supply chain disruption and the possibility of being forced into extended quarantines that would prevent them from purchasing toilet paper and related products, despite reassurance from industry and government that neither was likely to occur. As a result, some consumers began hoarding toilet paper, leading to reports of empty shelves, which in turn led to additional fear of a toilet paper shortage that prompted others to hoard toilet paper as well.<ref name=\"Forbes TP 1\">{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Bruce Y. |title=Is COVID-19 Coronavirus Leading To Toilet Paper Shortages?

In particular, as a result of [[Curfews and lockdowns related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|stay-at-home orders]], people have been spending much less time at schools, workplaces, and other public venues and much more time at home, thus using public toilets less frequently and home toilets more frequently. This has caused a strain on supply chains, since public toilets and home toilets generally use two different grades of toilet paper: commercial toilet paper and consumer toilet paper, respectively. [[Georgia-Pacific]] predicted a 40 percent increase in the use of consumer toilet paper as a result of people staying at home. Due to differences in roll size, packaging, and supply and distribution networks between the two grades, toilet paper manufacturers are expected to have difficulty shifting production to meet the shift in demand from commercial to home use, leading to lingering shortages even after panic buying subsides.<ref name=\"Vox TP\">{{cite news |last1=Nguyen |first1=Terry |title=The toilet paper shortage is more complicated than you think |url=https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/4/3/21206942/toilet-paper-coronavirus-shortage-supply-chain |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Others ==\nIn France, due to closed borders and the impossibility for foreign seasonal workers to come over,<ref name=\":10\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/coronavirus-la-cueillette-des-fraises-menacee-par-le-manque-de-main-d-oeuvre-et-de-debouches-1881783.html|title=Coronavirus: la cueillette des fraises menac\u00e9e par le manque de main d'oeuvre et de d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s|last=BFMTV|publisher=BFMTV|language=fr|access-date=26 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200326150948/https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/coronavirus-la-cueillette-des-fraises-menacee-par-le-manque-de-main-d-oeuvre-et-de-debouches-1881783.html|archive-date=26 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> the government's [[Didier Guillaume|Minister of Agriculture]] called for jobless volunteers to contact [[Strawberry|strawberries farms]] and help collect the harvest for the usual [[Minimum wage|minimal wage]].<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nLaboratory mice are being culled, and some strains are at risk of shortage due to lockdowns.<ref name=20200323sciencemag>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/it-s-heartbreaking-labs-are-euthanizing-thousands-mice-response-coronavirus-pandemic|title='It's heartbreaking.'

First, the excess demand due to the pandemic.  Second, the specialised nature of care of the critically ill and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of protective equipment (PPE). The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death. This last case applies across the health system and makes it harder to draw staff from non-COVID health workers.\n\nMitigations being used include recruiting military and sports medics, final-year doctors in training, private sector staff, and re-recruiting retired staff and those who have moved from the medical sector.\n\nFor non-medical roles staff have been recruited from other sectors.\n\n=== Patients overload===\nFacing the prospect of an unmanageable influx of patients both in his city and in others across the United States, [[New York City]] mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] called on the [[U.S. federal government]] to recruit additional medical staff to help meet demand.  He suggested recruiting from a pool that includes retired doctors and nurses, private surgeons, and others not actively tending to COVID-19 patients, and he proposed assigning and reassigning them as needed to different parts of the country depending on which cities and states were expected to be hardest hit at any given point in time.<ref name=\"20200403com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc.html|title=Opinion: We Need All Medical Workers on the Front Lines|first=Bill|last=de Blasio|date=3 April 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Isolation and trauma ===\n{{See also|Mental health during the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\nAs for China, medical staff are self isolating from families and under high emotional pressure.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nPsychological trauma is expected among medical professionals.<ref name=\"nytSick0329\">{{cite news |author=Jennifer Senior |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/opinion/coronavirus-ventilators-rationing-triage.html |title=Opinion &#124; Doctors Must Ration Ventilators as Coronavirus Rages.

In March 2020 at numerous stores throughout these countries, shoppers reported empty shelves in both the toilet paper section as well as sections for related products such as [[paper towel]]s, [[Tissue paper|tissue]]s, and [[diaper]]s. Initially, much of this was blamed on panic buying. Consumers began fearing both supply chain disruption and the possibility of being forced into extended quarantines that would prevent them from purchasing toilet paper and related products, despite reassurance from industry and government that neither was likely to occur. As a result, some consumers began hoarding toilet paper, leading to reports of empty shelves, which in turn led to additional fear of a toilet paper shortage that prompted others to hoard toilet paper as well.<ref name=\"Forbes TP 1\">{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Bruce Y. |title=Is COVID-19 Coronavirus Leading To Toilet Paper Shortages?

In particular, as a result of [[Curfews and lockdowns related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|stay-at-home orders]], people have been spending much less time at schools, workplaces, and other public venues and much more time at home, thus using public toilets less frequently and home toilets more frequently. This has caused a strain on supply chains, since public toilets and home toilets generally use two different grades of toilet paper: commercial toilet paper and consumer toilet paper, respectively. [[Georgia-Pacific]] predicted a 40 percent increase in the use of consumer toilet paper as a result of people staying at home. Due to differences in roll size, packaging, and supply and distribution networks between the two grades, toilet paper manufacturers are expected to have difficulty shifting production to meet the shift in demand from commercial to home use, leading to lingering shortages even after panic buying subsides.<ref name=\"Vox TP\">{{cite news |last1=Nguyen |first1=Terry |title=The toilet paper shortage is more complicated than you think |url=https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/4/3/21206942/toilet-paper-coronavirus-shortage-supply-chain |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Others ==\nIn France, due to closed borders and the impossibility for foreign seasonal workers to come over,<ref name=\":10\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/coronavirus-la-cueillette-des-fraises-menacee-par-le-manque-de-main-d-oeuvre-et-de-debouches-1881783.html|title=Coronavirus: la cueillette des fraises menac\u00e9e par le manque de main d'oeuvre et de d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s|last=BFMTV|publisher=BFMTV|language=fr|access-date=26 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200326150948/https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/coronavirus-la-cueillette-des-fraises-menacee-par-le-manque-de-main-d-oeuvre-et-de-debouches-1881783.html|archive-date=26 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> the government's [[Didier Guillaume|Minister of Agriculture]] called for jobless volunteers to contact [[Strawberry|strawberries farms]] and help collect the harvest for the usual [[Minimum wage|minimal wage]].<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nLaboratory mice are being culled, and some strains are at risk of shortage due to lockdowns.<ref name=20200323sciencemag>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/it-s-heartbreaking-labs-are-euthanizing-thousands-mice-response-coronavirus-pandemic|title='It's heartbreaking.'
