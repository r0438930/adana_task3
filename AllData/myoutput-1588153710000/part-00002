She is the [[Figure skating at the 1976 Olympics|1976 Olympic champion]] and [[1976 World Figure Skating Championships|1976 World champion]] in ladies' couples.\n\n==Early life==\nHamill was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], to Chalmers and Carol Hamill. Her father was a mechanical engineer.<ref name=espn031119/> Shortly after her birth, her family moved to the Riverside neighborhood of [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], where Hamill spent the rest of her childhood. She has two older siblings, a brother, Sandy, and a sister, Marcia.<ref name=espn031119/>\n\nHamill first started skating in early 1965 at the age of 8, taking once-a-week group lessons. She became more serious about the sport the next season, taking regular private lessons and passing her preliminary and first figure test before the seasonal rink closed in March. She would wake early in the morning to go to the rink for practice at 4:30 am.<ref name=espn031119/> Hamill was first coached by [[Otto Gold]] and [[Gustave Lussi]]. Ice time was limited in her area, so she eventually began training at Sky Rink in [[New York City]], staying overnight in the city with friends when possible. In the summers, Hamill trained in [[Lake Placid, New York]] and later in [[Toronto]] with her coach at the time, [[Sonya Klopfer|Sonya Dunfield]].<ref name=competitor/> During her career, her father would spend up to $20,000 a year on her skating expenses, including skating lessons, travel, living expenses, and costumes.<ref name=espn031119/>\n\nUntil the spring of 1970, Hamill attended public schools in Riverside, but at that point she switched to a small school with flexible tutoring to accommodate her skating schedule. She attended and graduated from [[Colorado Academy]] high school.<ref name=competitor/>\n\n==Career==\nHamill's first national success came in 1969, when she won the novice ladies' title at the [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]] at the age of 12. Later that spring, Hamill was invited to perform in [[Madison Square Garden]] with the exhibition tour (in later years known as [[Champions on Ice]]) that followed the [[1969 World Figure Skating Championships]]. She placed second at the junior level at the 1970 Championships, and made her senior debut in 1971.<ref name=competitor/> The [[U.S. Figure Skating Association]] arranged for her to be coached by [[Carlo Fassi]] when she began to compete internationally.<ref name=espn031119/>\n\nHamill was [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. champion]] from 1974 to 1976. At the 1974 World Championships in [[Munich, Germany]], she was in 3rd place after the [[compulsory figures]] and the short program. She was set to skate directly after the German skater [[Gerti Schanderl]], whose marks were booed while Hamill was already on the ice. Visibly upset, Hamill left the ice and burst into tears. After the crowd settled down, she returned to the ice and won the silver medal behind [[Christine Errath]] of East Germany.\n\nHamill competed with an injured right leg at the 1975 U.S. Championships.<ref name=CSGT750303/> She said her leg was fine after receiving treatment for a pulled hamstring (earlier believed to be pulled ligaments) while training in Denver during the month before the [[1975 World Figure Skating Championships|1975 World Championships]].<ref name=CSGT750303/> She won silver at Worlds in Colorado Springs, Colorado, behind [[Dianne de Leeuw]] of the Netherlands and ahead of Errath.\n\nHamill was disappointed by her performance at the 1976 U.S. Championships, admitting that she was outskated by [[Linda Fratianne]] because she had not trained properly. Immediately after the national championships, her coach [[Carlo Fassi]] left the U.S. to accompany his other star pupil, [[John Curry]], to the [[European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships]], leaving Hamill coachless with the Olympics only a few weeks away. She began training with Peter Burrows instead. She was pleased with their work together and wanted to bring him to the Olympics as her coach of record.<ref name=espn031119/> However, the USFSA refused her request, and she was reunited with Fassi for a brief period of training in Germany before the Olympics.<ref name=espn031119/><ref name=skatinglife/>\n\nAt the [[Figure skating at the 1976 Winter Olympics|1976 Winter Olympics]] in Innsbruck, Austria, Hamill came in second in the figures and then won the short and long programs, taking the gold medal. She was the last [[Single skating|single skater]] to win the Olympics without a triple jump.<ref name=espn031119/> Hamill also won the [[1976 World Figure Skating Championships|1976 World Championships]], and then turned professional.\n\nHamill is credited with developing a new skating move, a [[Figure skating spins|camel spin]] that turns into a [[Figure skating spins|sit spin]], which became known as the \"Hamill camel.\"<ref name=tpn121228/> The bobbed hairstyle that she wore during her Olympic performance was created by stylist Yusuke Suga <ref name=espn031119/> and started a fad, known as the \"short and sassy\" look.<ref name=hairfinder/> Her eyeglasses with oversized frames also started a trend in the 1970s.<ref name=espn031119/> The media dubbed her \"America's sweetheart.\"<ref name=tbs090922/>\n\nHamill was an [[Ice Capades]] headliner from 1977 to 1984. She was asked to join Ice Capades by Donna Atwood, who had been its star for years and who had eventually acquired financial control of the Ice Capades. Hamill was asked to be Atwood's successor as its new star.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.kabbage.com/blog/worst-celebrity-investments\n|title=The 7 Worst Celebrity Investments\n|accessdate=2013-04-28\n|website=Kabbage}}</ref> After Ice Capades folded due to competition and changing tastes, Hamill and her husband bought the financially strapped company's assets in 1993 in an effort to revive its earlier success, but they declared bankruptcy in 1994. It was sold to Pat Robertson's [[International Family Entertainment]], Inc. in 1995.<ref name=nbctoday/>\n\nIn 1993, the Associated Press released results of a national sports study showing that Hamill was statistically tied for first place with fellow Olympian [[Mary Lou Retton]] as the most popular athlete in America, ranking far ahead of other major sports stars such as [[Michael Jordan]], [[Magic Johnson]], [[Troy Aikman]], [[Dan Marino]], [[Wayne Gretzky]], [[Joe Montana]], [[Nolan Ryan]], and 800 other athletes.<ref name=ap930517/>\n\nHamill has continued to skate in shows, including a regular principal role with [[Broadway on Ice]]. She was a special guest in the [[Brian Boitano]]\u2013[[Barry Manilow]] skating extravaganza at [[AT&T Park]] in San Francisco in 2007.\n\nIn February 2013, it was revealed that Hamill would take part in the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 16)|sixteenth season]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', partnering with [[Tristan MacManus]]. After only two dances, on March 26, 2013 she was forced to withdraw from the competition upon advice from her spine surgeon due to a severe strain on her lower back which was caused during practice.<ref name=usm130327/><ref name=ew130327/>\n\nOn March 3, 2017, Hamill was announced as one of 16 celebrities taking part in a cooking competition on the Food Network TV series ''[[Chopped (TV series)|Chopped]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.foodnetwork.com/fn-dish/2017/03/chopped-star-power-tournament/ |title=Celebrities Enter the Chopped Kitchen for Charity in the All-New Star Power Tournament |date=March 2017}}</ref> She was featured in the \"Star Power: Culinary Muscle\" episode, alongside former NFL player [[LaMarr Woodley]], Olympic medalist fencer [[Mariel Zagunis]], and UFC fighter [[Paige VanZant]]. Hamill was the third and last contestant to be eliminated, narrowly missing out on advancing to the final heat, losing to Paige VanZant in the final round.\n\n==Personal life==\nHamill wrote an autobiography titled ''On and Off the Ice''. She was married and divorced twice: to singer/actor [[Dean Paul Martin]] (1982\u20131984), and then to Kenneth Forsythe (1987\u20131995), with whom she had a daughter named Alexandra. Hamill married her third husband, John MacColl, in 2009.<ref name=abc130227/>  Her second autobiography ''A Skating Life: My Story'', was published in 2007.\n\nFor much of her adult life, Hamill has experienced chronic depression, which is controlled through medication and therapy. Her daughter also suffers from the condition.<ref name = cbsnews/> In 2008, Hamill announced that she was being treated for [[breast cancer]].<ref name = people080104/>\n\nHamill was a mentor to 2010 U.S. national champion [[Rachael Flatt]].<ref name=tbs090922/> Flatt, like Hamill, trained in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].\n\n==Competition highlights==\n{|  class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #ffdead; \" colspan=9 align=center | International\n|-\n!

She was a special guest in the [[Brian Boitano]]\u2013[[Barry Manilow]] skating extravaganza at [[AT&T Park]] in San Francisco in 2007.\n\nIn February 2013, it was revealed that Hamill would take part in the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 16)|sixteenth season]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', partnering with [[Tristan MacManus]]. After only two dances, on March 26, 2013 she was forced to withdraw from the competition upon advice from her spine surgeon due to a severe strain on her lower back which was caused during practice.<ref name=usm130327/><ref name=ew130327/>\n\nOn March 3, 2017, Hamill was announced as one of 16 celebrities taking part in a cooking competition on the Food Network TV series ''[[Chopped (TV series)|Chopped]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.foodnetwork.com/fn-dish/2017/03/chopped-star-power-tournament/ |title=Celebrities Enter the Chopped Kitchen for Charity in the All-New Star Power Tournament |date=March 2017}}</ref> She was featured in the \"Star Power: Culinary Muscle\" episode, alongside former NFL player [[LaMarr Woodley]], Olympic medalist fencer [[Mariel Zagunis]], and UFC fighter [[Paige VanZant]]. Hamill was the third and last contestant to be eliminated, narrowly missing out on advancing to the final heat, losing to Paige VanZant in the final round.\n\n==Personal life==\nHamill wrote an autobiography titled ''On and Off the Ice''. She was married and divorced twice: to singer/actor [[Dean Paul Martin]] (1982\u20131984), and then to Kenneth Forsythe (1987\u20131995), with whom she had a daughter named Alexandra. Hamill married her third husband, John MacColl, in 2009.<ref name=abc130227/>  Her second autobiography ''A Skating Life: My Story'', was published in 2007.\n\nFor much of her adult life, Hamill has experienced chronic depression, which is controlled through medication and therapy. Her daughter also suffers from the condition.<ref name = cbsnews/> In 2008, Hamill announced that she was being treated for [[breast cancer]].<ref name = people080104/>\n\nHamill was a mentor to 2010 U.S. national champion [[Rachael Flatt]].<ref name=tbs090922/> Flatt, like Hamill, trained in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].\n\n==Competition highlights==\n{|  class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #ffdead; \" colspan=9 align=center | International\n|-\n!
