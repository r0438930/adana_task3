{"title_page": "Mro alphabet", "text_new": "#REDIRECT [[Mru language#Script]]\n{{ This is my  user new topic}}\n\nMro is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken by about 22,000 people mainly in Bandarban District of the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh. It is also spoken in Sittwe (Akiab) in Rakhine State in Burma. Mro speakers live mainly in forest areas of Lama, Ruma, Alikaram and Thanchi near Chimbuk Mountain of Bandarban District. A small number also live in Rangamati Hill District.\n\n\nThe language is also known as Mru, which means 'human', and the people who speak it called themselves Mro-cha ('human beings'). Other tribes in the areas where the Mro live call them Murong ('strangers').\n\n\nContents\n\n===== Mro alphabe =====\nt\nThe Mro alphabet was created during the 1980s by Menlay Murang, or Manley Mro, a Mro who believed the creation of the alphabet was a redemption for a catastrophe told in Mro legend. The legend talks of the god Turai writing down a script and religion for the Mro people in a book and giving it to a cow to deliver. Unfortunately the cow became hungry on the long journey to earth and ate the book. Thus knowledge of the script was lost.\n\nKrama- A new religion\nMro, also known as Murong, an indigenous community living for hundreds of years in the south-eastern hills of Bangladesh were frustrated for not having formal religion. The myth depicts that like other tribes God offered them a religion and language alphabet but the script written on banana leaf was eaten by the bearer cow. They used to punish the representative cow in a festival which became their most distinctive ritual. Among other 11 tribes in the same hills Mro is the only half-nude community who are illustrious for their Dance and Music. In 1984, a man named Manley Mro came up as the redeemer who brings them out of this catastrophe. He first introduced Mro Alphabet as well as scripted their lost religion which is now known as \"Crama\". In the course of three decade, the Mro in major numbers have converted to Crama (or Khrama). Now it is working as spiritual and philosophical catalyst for change in the community and leading to a socio-cultural transformation.\n\nAround 80% of the Mro are thought to be literate in their own script, and it is taught in schools for the first 3 grades of primary education.\n\nNotable features\n\nType of writing system: alphabet Dirction of writing: left to right in horizontal lines Used to write: Mru/Mro Mru alphabet\n\nThe Mro alphabet is shown with the names of the letters in the Roman alphabet, in the Bengali script, and transcribed in the IPA.\n\n===== Mru numerals and punctuation =====\nDownload the Mro alphabet chart (Excel)\n\nSample words in Mro\nSample words in Mru\nSource: http://www.banglajol.info/index.php/DUJL/article/download/4149/3443\n\n===== Sample text in Mro =====\nSample text in Mro\n\nLinks Information about Mro http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mru_language http://www.ethnologue.com/language/mro http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=script_detail&key=Mroo http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3589.pdf\n\nMro font http://phjamr.github.io/mro.html\n\nTibeto-Burman languages Achang, Arakanese, Balti, Bantawa, Bisu, Drung, Dzongkha, Garo, Hajong, Hani, Hmar, Jingpho, Karen, Kayah Li, Ladakhi, Lahu, Lepcha, Limbu, Lipo, Lisu, Manipuri, Marma, Mro, Naxi, Nepal Bhasa / Newari, Sikkimese, Sunuwar, Tangkhul Naga, Tibetan, Tshangla, Tujia, Yi\n\n===== Alphabets =====\nAdlam, Armenian, Avestan, Avoiuli, Bassa (Vah), Beitha Kukju, Borama / Gadabuursi, Carian, Carpathian Basin Rovas, Chinuk pipa, Coorgi-Cox, Coptic, Cyrillic, Dalecarlian runes, Deseret, Elbasan, Etruscan, Faliscan, Galik, Georgian (Asomtavruli), Georgian (Nuskhuri), Georgian (Mkhedruli), Glagolitic, Gothic, Greek, Irish (Uncial), Kaddare, Khatt-i-Bad\u00ed\u2019, Khazarian Rovas, Korean, Latin, Lepontic, Luo Lakeside Script, Lycian, Lydian, Manchu, Mandaic, Mandombe, Marsiliana, Messapic, Mongolian, Mro, Naguak\u00e9 Ta\u00edno Pictographic Alphabet, N'Ko, North Picene, Ogham, Old Church Slavonic, Oirat Clear Script, Old Italic, Old Nubian, Old Permic, Orkhon, Oscan, Pau Cin Hau, Phrygian, Pollard script, Runic, Santali, Sz\u00e9kely-Hungarian Rov\u00e1s (Hungarian Runes), Somali (Osmanya), South Picene, Sutton SignWriting, Tai Lue, Todhri, Umbrian, Uyghur, Zaghawa Other writing system\n\n===== References =====\n<ref>Omniglot the online encyclopedia of writting systems & Languages.</ref>\n<ref>Mr.Hasan\n</ref>\n", "text_old": "#REDIRECT [[Mru language#Script]]\n", "name_user": "Mro(Mru) people", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(added my heading and references)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mro_alphabet&redirect=no"}
