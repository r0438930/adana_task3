They were first discovered while touring with [[The Osmonds]] in the early 1970s and signed with Family Productions, releasing their first single in 1972, \"Special Someone,\" but their big break came after moving to [[ABC Records]] and working with the [[record producer]] [[Steve Barri]] in 1973. Although their first single with ABC, \"Deeper and Deeper,\" failed to make a big impression on the [[record chart|charts]],<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> beginning in 1974, the band began a string of hit songs. Their first two (and largest two) hits were [[cover version]]s of [[United Kingdom|British]] hit songs whose original versions had not been hits in the U.S.: \"[[Billy Don't Be a Hero]]\" (a cover of a #1 UK [[Paper Lace]] song that reached #1 for 2 weeks on the Hot 100 with the Heywoods' version) and \"[[Who Do You Think You Are (Jigsaw song)|Who Do You Think You Are]]\" (written by Clive Scott & Des Dyer of [[Jigsaw (band)|Jigsaw]], which originally became a hit for [[Candlewick Green]] and reached #15 on the Hot 100 with the Heywoods' version). This was followed by their last top-40 hit, \"The Heartbreak Kid\" (#39 Hot 100), and their ominously titled last Hot 100 hit, \"[[Our Last Song Together]]\" (#95 on the Hot 100, the last song written by the [[Neil Sedaka|Sedaka]]-[[Howard Greenfield|Greenfield]] tandem before its breakup).  \"Billy Don't Be a Hero\" sold over three and a half million copies, receiving a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in June 1974.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/344 344]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/344\n}}</ref> Despite the song's popularity, many people disliked it, and it was voted #8 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's readers' poll of \"10 Worst Songs of the 1970s.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-10-worst-songs-of-the-1970s-20111019/8-bo-donaldson-and-the-heywoods-billy-dont-be-a-hero-0775699|title=Readers' Poll: The 10 Worst Songs of the 1970s : #8 - Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods - 'Billy Don't Be A Hero'|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=19 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, they began a migration across three other [[record label]]s as the hits dried up by the end of the decade. By 1978, they were known as \"The Bo Donaldson Band\" and eventually split after trying [[country music]] with no success in the 1980s.  They reformed again in 1996 as a nostalgia act and still make appearances, most notably in the [[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]] hosted nostalgia show, ''Original Idols Live''.\n\nIn 1996, Varese Vintage Records released ''Best of Bo Donaldson And the Heywoods'', a 15-song compilation of material originally released on Family Productions (1972) and ABC Records (1973\u20131975).  The CD contains all their charted singles and, in fact, includes 9 of the 11 songs featured on the 1974 LP ''Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods'' (#97 on the Hot 200).  The CD booklet includes liner notes written by [[Gordon Pogoda]] and the CD features such highlights as \"Who Do You Think You Are\", \"The House on Telegraph Hill\", and \"The Heartbreak Kid\".  In 1975, the band was working on a second album of material for ABC including \"Our Last Song Together\", released as a single (and which made the pop charts), and \"Take Me Make Me Yours\", which to this day remains unreleased.  Ultimately the group left the label and joined Capitol Records, where they recorded songs by Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, the writing/producing team behind the UK act [[The Sweet]], and released the album \"Farther On\" in 1975.\n\nLead singer and trumpeter Mike Gibbons died on 2 April 2016.\n\n==Members==\n*Robert Walter \"Bo\" Donaldson - [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]\n*Mike Gibbons - lead [[human voice|vocals]] and [[trumpet]]\n*David Krock - [[bass guitar]] and [[backing vocalist]]\n*Rick Joswick - lead vocals and [[tambourine]]\n*Gary Coveyou - [[saxophone]], [[flute]] and backing vocalist\n*Baker Scott - guitar (1974)\n*Richard Brunetti - [[drum]]s\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n*''Special Someone'' (Family, 1972)\n*''Bo Donaldson & The Heywoods (ABC, 1974) (# 97 [[Billboard Magazine]] Hot 200)\n*''Farther On'' (Capitol, 1975)\n*''The Best of Bo Donaldson & The Heywoods'' (CD, Varese Sarabande, 1996)\n\n===Singles===\n*\"Special Someone\" (U.S. ''Billboard'' #64, ''Cash Box'' #51, 1972)\n*\"Deeper and Deeper\" (1974)\n*\"[[Billy, Don't Be a Hero]]\" (U.S. #1, AC #20; Canada #1, 1974)\n*\"[[Who Do You Think You Are (Candlewick Green song)|Who Do You Think You Are]]\" (U.S. #15, AC #19; Canada #11, 1974)\n*\"The Heartbreak Kid\" (U.S. #39, 1974)\n*\"[[Our Last Song Together]]\" (U.S. #95, 1975)\n*\"[[A Fool Like You]]\" (1976)\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of artists who reached number one in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bodonaldson.net/ Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods official website]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods}}\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1965]]\n[[Category:American pop music groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Cincinnati]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Ohio]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=April 2010}}\n{{Infobox musical artist  <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians -->\n| name                = Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods\n| image                 = \n| caption            = \n| image_size            = \n| background          = group_or_band\n| origin              = [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]],<br/>[[United States]]\n| genre               = [[Pop music|Pop]], [[garage rock]]\n| years_active        = 1965&ndash;1980; 1996&ndash;present\n| label               = \n| associated_acts     = \n| website                 = [http://www.bodonaldson.net/ Official website]\n| current_members     = Bo Donaldson<br/>Mike Gibbons<br/>David Krock<br/>Rick Joswick<br/>Gary Coveyou<br/>Baker Scott<br/>Richard Brunetti \n}}\n\n'''Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods''' are an [[United States|American]] [[pop music]] [[musical ensemble|group]], known mainly for their 1970s [[hit single]]s, \"[[Billy Don't Be a Hero]]\" and \"[[Who_Do_You_Think_You_Are_(Candlewick_Green_song)#Bo_Donaldson_and_the_Heywoods_cover|Who Do You Think You Are]]\".\n\n==History==\nThe band was formed in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] in 1965 by their leader, [[Bo Donaldson|Robert Walter \"Bo\" Donaldson]].
