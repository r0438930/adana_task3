The vast majority of present-day speakers live in Africa.

The constitution of the Republic of the Congo uses the name ''Kitub\u00e0'', and the one of the Democratic Republic of the Congo uses the term ''Kikongo'', even if Kituba is used in the administration.\n\n== Writing ==\n[[File:Kikongo-m.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Hail Mary]] in Kikongo.]]\nAt present there is no standard orthography of Kikongo, with a variety in use in written literature, mostly newspapers, pamphlets and a few books.\n\nKongo was the earliest [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language which was committed to writing in Latin characters and had the earliest dictionary of any Bantu language. A catechism was produced under the authority of Diogo Gomes, a Jesuit born in Kongo of Portuguese parents in 1557, but no version of it exists today.\n\nIn 1624, Mateus Cardoso, another [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Jesuit]], edited and published a Kongo translation of the Portuguese catechism of Marcos Jorge. The preface informs us that the translation was done by Kongo teachers from [[S\u00e3o Salvador do Congo|S\u00e3o Salvador]] (modern [[Mbanza-Kongo|Mbanza Kongo]]) and was probably partially the work of F\u00e9lix do Esp\u00edrito Santo (also a Kongo).<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Bontinck and D.

In the back of this dictionary is found a sermon of two pages written only in Kongo. The dictionary has some 10,000 words.\n\nAdditional dictionaries were created by French missionaries to the [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]] coast in the 1780s, and a word list was published by Bernardo da Canecattim in 1805.\n\nBaptist missionaries who arrived in Kongo in 1879 developed a modern orthography of the language.\n\n[[W. Holman Bentley]]'s ''Dictionary and Grammar of the Kongo Language'' was published in 1887. In the preface, Bentley gave credit to Nlemvo, an African, for his assistance, and described \"the methods he used to compile the dictionary, which included sorting and correcting 25,000 slips of paper containing words and their definitions.\"<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Dictionary and Grammar of the Kongo Language, as Spoken at San Salvador, the Ancient Capital of the Old Kongo Empire, West Africa: Preface\n| work = [[World Digital Library]]\n| accessdate = 2013-05-23\n| url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2533/\n}}</ref> Eventually W. Holman Bentley with the special assistance of Jo\u00e3o Lemvo produced a complete [[Christian Bible]] in 1905.\n\n==Linguistic classification==\nKikongo belongs to the Bantu language family.\n\nAccording to [[Malcolm Guthrie]], Kikongo is in the language group H10, the [[Kongo languages]]. Other languages in the same group include [[Bembe language (Kibembe)|Bembe]] (H11). ''Ethnologue'' 16 counts Ndingi (H14) and Mboka (H15) as dialects of Kongo, though it acknowledges they may be distinct languages.\n\nAccording to Bastin, Coupez and Man's classification (Tervuren) which is more recent and precise than that of Guthrie on Kikongo, the language has the following dialects:\n\n*Kikongo group H16\n**Southern Kikongo H16a\n**Central Kikongo H16b\n**Yombe H16c\n**Fiote H16d\n**Western Kikongo H16d\n**Bwende H16e\n**Lari H16f\n**Eastern Kikongo H16g\n**Southeastern Kikongo H16h\n\nThe Yombe language (also called Kiyombe) is a Kikongo dialect spoken by the Yombe people, who live in a area closed to the Atlantic Ocean. The Yombe language has contributed many concepts to black African communities across the world, probably because during the slave trade in west and central Africa, many slaves come from or transited through that region.\n\n== Phonology ==\n\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|+caption|Consonant phonemes\n!\n!colspan=2| [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n!colspan=2| [[Coronal consonant|Coronal]]\n!colspan=2| [[Dorsal consonant|Dorsal]]\n|-\n![[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|style=border-right:0| ||style=border-left:0|''m'' {{IPAslink|m}}\n|style=border-right:0| ||style=border-left:0|''n'' {{IPAslink|n}}\n|style=border-right:0| ||style=border-left:0|''ng'' {{IPAslink|\u014b}}\n|-\n!rowspan=2|<small>([[prenasalized consonant|prenasalized]])</small><br>[[Plosive consonant|Plosive]]\n|style=border-right:0|''mp'' {{IPA|/\u1d50p/}}||style=border-left:0|''mb'' {{IPA|/\u1d50b/}}\n|style=border-right:0|''nt'' {{IPA|/\u207ft/}}||style=border-left:0|''nd'' {{IPA|/\u207fd/}}\n|style=border-right:0|''nk'' {{IPA|/\u1d51k/}}||style=border-left:0|\n|-\n|style=border-right:0|''p'' {{IPAslink|p}}||style=border-left:0|''b'' {{IPAslink|b}}\n|style=border-right:0|''t'' {{IPAslink|t}}||style=border-left:0|''d'' {{IPAslink|d}}\n|style=border-right:0|''k'' {{IPAslink|k}}||style=border-left:0|\n|-\n!rowspan=2|<small>([[prenasalized consonant|prenasalized]])</small><br>[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n|style=border-right:0|''mf'' {{IPA|/\u1dacf/}}||style=border-left:0|''mv'' {{IPA|/\u1dacv/}}\n|style=border-right:0|''ns'' {{IPA|/\u207fs/}}||style=border-left:0|''nz'' {{IPA|/\u207fz/}}\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n|style=border-right:0|''f'' {{IPAslink|f}}||style=border-left:0|''v'' {{IPAslink|v}}\n|style=border-right:0|''s'' {{IPAslink|s}}||style=border-left:0|''z'' {{IPAslink|z}}\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n![[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|style=border-right:0| ||style=border-left:0|''w'' {{IPAslink|w}}\n|style=border-right:0| ||style=border-left:0|''l'' {{IPAslink|l}}\n|style=border-right:0| ||style=border-left:0|''y'' {{IPAslink|j}}\n|}\n\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|+caption|Vowel phonemes\n!\n![[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n![[Close vowel|High]]\n|''i'' {{IPAslink|i}} \n|''u'' {{IPAslink|u}}\n|-\n![[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n|''e'' {{IPAslink|e\u031e|e}} \n|''o'' {{IPAslink|o\u031e|o}}\n|-\n![[Open vowel|Low]]\n|colspan=2|''a'' {{IPAslink|\u00e4|a}}  \n|}\n\nThere is contrastive [[vowel length]]. /m/ and /n/ also have [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]] variants, which contrast with prenasalized consonants.\n\n== English words of Kongo origin ==\n* The [[Southern American English]] word \"goober\", meaning [[peanut]], comes from Kongo ''nguba''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/16/G0191600.html|title=Bartleby.com: Great Books Online -- Quotes, Poems, Novels, Classics and hundreds more|website=www.bartleby.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328052814/http://www.bartleby.com/61/16/G0191600.html|archivedate=2008-03-28}}</ref>\n* The word \"zombie\" comes from Kongo nzombie, meaning \"dead.\".  \"Nfumu ya nzombie\" is \"Chief of the dead\", or God.\n* The word [[funk]], or funky, in American [[popular music]] has its origin, some say, in the Kongo word ''Lu-fuki''.<ref>Farris Thompson, in his work Flash Of The Spirit: African & Afro-American Art & Philosophy</ref>\n* The name of the Cuban dance ''[[mambo (dance)|mambo]]'' comes from a Bantu word meaning \"conversation with the gods\".\nIn addition, the roller coaster [[Kumba (roller coaster)|Kumba]] at [[Busch Gardens Tampa Bay]] in [[Tampa, Florida]] gets its name from the Kongo word for \"roar\".\n\n== Presence in the Americas ==\n\nMany African slaves transported in the [[Atlantic slave trade]] spoke Kongo, and its influence can be seen in many [[Creole language|creole languages]] in the [[African diaspora|diaspora]], such as [[Palenquero]] (spoken by descendants of escaped black slaves in [[Colombia]]), [[Habla Congo|Habla Congo/Habla Bantu]] (the [[liturgical language]] of the Afro-Cuban [[Palo (religion)|Palo]] religion), [[Saramaccan language]] in Suriname and [[Haitian Creole]].\n\n== Literature ==\nIn 2018, a book written in Kikongo was nominated for the [[Grand Prix of Literary Associations]].<ref>Source: [http://bamendaonline.net/gpla-2018-finals-maybe-the-year-of-english%EF%BB%BF/ Bamenda Online]</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Kikongo}}\n{{InterWiki|code=kg}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070322025256/http://www.panafril10n.org/wikidoc/pmwiki.php/PanAfrLoc/Kongo PanAfrican L10n page on Kongo]\n*{{Cite book\n| publisher = London Baptist Missionary Society\n| last = Bentley\n| first = William Holman\n| title = Dictionary and grammar of the Kongo language, as spoken at San Salvador, the ancient capital of the old Kongo empire, West Africa.

comes from a Bantu word meaning \"conversation with the gods\".\nIn addition, the roller coaster [[Kumba (roller coaster)|Kumba]] at [[Busch Gardens Tampa Bay]] in [[Tampa, Florida]] gets its name from the Kongo word for \"roar\".\n\n== Presence in the Americas ==\n\nMany African slaves transported in the [[Atlantic slave trade]] spoke Kongo, and its influence can be seen in many [[Creole
