It is located near [[Al Waleed (town)|Al Walid]] town close to the [[Baghdad\u2013Amman highway]] in the [[Al Anbar]] desert west of Iraq, near the Jordanian border and 1000&nbsp;km from the Iranian borders. It was erected to secure the western borders of Iraq and was also used in the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAccording to Iraqi sources, during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], it was used as a support airbase for the [[Iraqi Air Force]] and housed no more than a few transportation squadrons and a squadron of [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]s, as well as retired [[Hawker Hunter]]s.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Iraqi_Fighters.html?id=waSstwAACAAJ&redir_esc=y Iraqi Fighters: 1953-2003: Camouflage & Markings''] {{ISBN|978-0615214146}}</ref>\n\nThe IRIAF had received \"credible\" reports that Iraq \u2013 reinforced by the arrival of large amounts of ammunition and spare parts from Egypt, as well as by the delivery of [[Mirage F1]]s from France and [[Tupolev Tu-22]] bombers from the Soviets<ref name=jamaran /> \u2013 had been preparing for an imminent major ground and air offensive against Iran.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /> According to Iranian intelligence, the Iraqi Air Force had relocated most of its valuable assets to its Al-Walid air base, located in the H-3 complex.\n\nAs part of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s attempts to carry out a successful offensive against Iran on the northern front between 12 and 22 March 1981, Iraq fired two [[9K52 Luna-M]] surface-to-surface rockets against the cities of [[Dezful]] and [[Ahvaz]]. Within days after this attack, commanders of the 31st and 32nd Tactical Fighter Wing in [[Shahrokhi Air Base]] (TAB 3, near [[Hamadan]]) planned a counter-attack to degrade the Iraqi Air Force's capabilities.\n\n===The attack===\nBeing almost 1500 kilometres from the Iranian fighters at Shahrokhi Air Base, H-3 was out of range and if choosing a direct route, the Iranian aircraft would have had to fly over [[Baghdad]] and perform [[aerial refueling]] twice in Iraqi airspace, including once near Baghdad, which was heavily fortified by Iraqi air defence sites.<ref name=jamaran />\n\nA team of IRIAF commanders (including Col. [[Bahram Hooshyar]] and Col. Fereydoun Izadseta) planned a more sophisticated, surprise operation instead. Senior Iranian military officials had determined that Iraqi Air Force activity was lower in northern Iraq, so a plan was made to approach the Iraqi sites from that direction. To increase their chances, the Iranian commanders decided to fly their aircraft to [[Urmia Lake]] first and refuel in the air, and then from there they would have a \"clean\" route passing over the mountains of northern Iraqi\u2013Turkish border, while keeping the altitude at less than 300&nbsp;ft (100&nbsp;m) to avoid Iraqi and Turkish [[radar]]s.<ref name=BishopCooper2000>{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Farzad|last2=Cooper|first2=Tom|title=Iran-Iraq War in the Air, 1980-1988.|date=2000|publisher=Schiffer Pub.|location=Atglen|isbn=9780764316692|page=119}}</ref><ref name=aja /> The route was around 3,500&nbsp;km.<ref name=Bishop2014 /> Nevertheless, the Phantoms could not reach their target without aerial refuelling a number of times.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 />\n\nThe 31st and 32nd Tactical Fighter Wings (TFW) employed eight [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom]]s, four [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|Grumman F-14A Tomcat]]s, one [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Lockheed C-130H Khofaash]], a [[Boeing 747]] airborne command post (which was to monitor Iraqi radio communications, and also act as a communication relay between the raiders and the IRIAF HQ), and two tankers (a [[Boeing 707]] and a [[Boeing 747]]) for aerial refueling for the attack.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /><ref name=MEMIM>{{cite web|url=http://memim.com/h3-airstrike.html|title=H3 airstrike|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=|website=MEMIM Encyclopedia|publisher=|access-date=20 January 2016|quote=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129042258/http://memim.com/h3-airstrike.html|archive-date=29 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Operation H3 map.png|thumb|right|alt=A map of Iraq showing the aircraft involved and their route.|Map of the operation, showing the aircraft involved and their route.]]\n\nThe operation began at 10:30am of 4 April 1981. A formation of eight F-4 Phantoms (including six F-4Es and two F-4Ds), accompanied by two airborne reserves, departed from [[Hamedan Air Base]] (TAB 3) and proceeded towards [[Urmia Lake]] and then, after refueling in friendly airspace, crossed into Iraq, while the two reserve aircraft returned. A pair of F-14 Tomcats patrolled the area hours before and after the strike began to counter any interception attempts by the Iraqi Air Force. Meanwhile, three [[Northrop F-5|Northrop F-5E]]s from [[Tabriz Air Base]] ([[TFB.2]]) performed diversionary attacks on [[Kirkuk Air Base|Hurriya Air Base]] near [[Kirkuk]], with unknown results, but certainly distracting Iraqis away from the Phantoms.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /><ref name=jamaran>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaran.ir/fa/NewsContent-id_23309.aspx|title=\u0639\u0645\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0686-3 \u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u067e\u06cc\u0686\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0646\u0642\u0634\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062d\u0645\u0644\u0647 \u0647\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a|publisher=}}</ref> The C-130H was flying near the Iran\u2013Iraq border. Some time earlier, the two tankers, which already had been sent to Syria, had taken off from a Syrian airport, and then clandestinely diverted from international commercial corridors in total radio silence, while apparently being bound for Iran. Flying at a very low altitude over southern Turkey and eastern Syria, they crossed mountainous northwestern Iraq and finally joined the Phantoms over the western Iraqi desert. Each Phantom refueled four times from the tankers, at the altitude of 300&nbsp;ft (100&nbsp;m), which was risky and far below any safety standards<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /> (aerial refueling is normally performed at 22,000&nbsp;ft).<ref name=aja /> This was done to avoid detection by Iraqi radars; however, the fighters briefly appeared several times on the radars, but were mistaken for Turkish aircraft patrolling the border. Colonel Izadseta supervised the operation from a command Boeing 747 that was in Syria's airspace. The Syrian [[Palmyra Airport|airport at Palmyra]] could also be used for possible emergency landing.\n\nWhile approaching the airbases, the Phantoms split their formation into two groups, ''Alvand'' and ''Alborz''. This allowed attacks to come from several directions on the H3 complex. They bombed all three airfields within the H-3 complex.<ref name=Bishop2014 /> Achieving complete surprise, the fighters made several passes against all three airbases. Both runways at Al-Walid were targeted in order to prevent any Iraqi aircraft from taking off. Cluster bombs of the second group of Phantoms damaged three large [[hangar]]s. The Phantoms were able to make multiple attacks on multiple targets with cannon fire. By the end of the second group's attack the Iraqi military forces had not responded with a coordinated counter-attack. Effective [[anti-aircraft]] fire was also impaired due to the surprise attack. Iraqi aircraft were scrambled in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept the Iranian force.\n\nAfter the attack, the Iranian formation turned back towards its own bases. Iranian military officials stated that all Iranian Phantoms were undamaged during the attack.<ref name=\"target p7-8\">Cooper and Bishop ''Air Enthusiast'' March/April 2004, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Casualties===\nThe IRIAF claimed it destroyed a total of three [[Antonov An-12|Antonov An-12BP]] transports, a [[Tupolev Tu-16]] bomber, four [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]s, five [[Sukhoi Su-17|Sukhoi Su-20/22s]], eight [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]]s, two [[Dassault Mirage F1|Dassault Mirage F1EQs]] (delivered only weeks earlier) and four helicopters,<ref name=Bishop2014>{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Farzad|title=Iranian F-4 Phantom II Units in Combat|date=2014|publisher=Osprey Pub.|location=London|isbn=9781782007081|page=15}}</ref> as well as damaging eleven others beyond repair, including two Tu-16 bombers.

This has been disputed by Iraqi officials. Iraqi sources claimed that only a single MiG-21 was damaged by the attack; that the damaged hangars were empty at the time of the attack; and that its Tu-22s and Tu-16s were stationed at [[Al-Taqaddum Air Base|Tammuz Airbase]] due to the ongoing war with Iran. Iraq claimed that the bombers were stationed at Tammuz until they were retired from the Iraqi Air Force in the late 1980s, and then were bombed in 1991 during the [[Gulf War]].<ref>[http://www.algardenia.com/thaqafawaadab/9186-1931-2003.html ''The Power and the Strategic Role of the Iraqi Air Force 1931-2003''] Lt.

It is located near [[Al Waleed (town)|Al Walid]] town close to the [[Baghdad\u2013Amman highway]] in the [[Al Anbar]] desert west of Iraq, near the Jordanian border and 1000&nbsp;km from the Iranian borders. It was erected to secure the western borders of Iraq and was also used in the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAccording to Iraqi sources, during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], it was used as a support airbase for the [[Iraqi Air Force]] and housed no more than a few transportation squadrons and a squadron of [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]s, as well as retired [[Hawker Hunter]]s.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Iraqi_Fighters.html?id=waSstwAACAAJ&redir_esc=y Iraqi Fighters: 1953-2003: Camouflage & Markings''] {{ISBN|978-0615214146}}</ref>\n\nThe IRIAF had received \"credible\" reports that Iraq \u2013 reinforced by the arrival of large amounts of ammunition and spare parts from Egypt, as well as by the delivery of [[Mirage F1]]s from France and [[Tupolev Tu-22]] bombers from the Soviets<ref name=jamaran /> \u2013 had been preparing for an imminent major ground and air offensive against Iran.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /> According to Iranian intelligence, the Iraqi Air Force had relocated most of its valuable assets to its Al-Walid air base, located in the H-3 complex.\n\nAs part of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s attempts to carry out a successful offensive against Iran on the northern front between 12 and 22 March 1981, Iraq fired two [[9K52 Luna-M]] surface-to-surface rockets against the cities of [[Dezful]] and [[Ahvaz]]. Within days after this attack, commanders of the 31st and 32nd Tactical Fighter Wing in [[Shahrokhi Air Base]] (TAB 3, near [[Hamadan]]) planned a counter-attack to degrade the Iraqi Air Force's capabilities.\n\n===The attack===\nBeing almost 1500 kilometres from the Iranian fighters at Shahrokhi Air Base, H-3 was out of range and if choosing a direct route, the Iranian aircraft would have had to fly over [[Baghdad]] and perform [[aerial refueling]] twice in Iraqi airspace, including once near Baghdad, which was heavily fortified by Iraqi air defence sites.<ref name=jamaran />\n\nA team of IRIAF commanders (including Col. [[Bahram Hooshyar]] and Col. Fereydoun Izadseta) planned a more sophisticated, surprise operation instead. Senior Iranian military officials had determined that Iraqi Air Force activity was lower in northern Iraq, so a plan was made to approach the Iraqi sites from that direction. To increase their chances, the Iranian commanders decided to fly their aircraft to [[Urmia Lake]] first and refuel in the air, and then from there they would have a \"clean\" route passing over the mountains of northern Iraqi\u2013Turkish border, while keeping the altitude at less than 300&nbsp;ft (100&nbsp;m) to avoid Iraqi and Turkish [[radar]]s.<ref name=BishopCooper2000>{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Farzad|last2=Cooper|first2=Tom|title=Iran-Iraq War in the Air, 1980-1988.|date=2000|publisher=Schiffer Pub.|location=Atglen|isbn=9780764316692|page=119}}</ref><ref name=aja /> The route was around 3,500&nbsp;km.<ref name=Bishop2014 /> Nevertheless, the Phantoms could not reach their target without aerial refuelling a number of times.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 />\n\nThe 31st and 32nd Tactical Fighter Wings (TFW) employed eight [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom]]s, four [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|Grumman F-14A Tomcat]]s, one [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Lockheed C-130H Khofaash]], a [[Boeing 747]] airborne command post (which was to monitor Iraqi radio communications, and also act as a communication relay between the raiders and the IRIAF HQ), and two tankers (a [[Boeing 707]] and a [[Boeing 747]]) for aerial refueling for the attack.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /><ref name=MEMIM>{{cite web|url=http://memim.com/h3-airstrike.html|title=H3 airstrike|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=|website=MEMIM Encyclopedia|publisher=|access-date=20 January 2016|quote=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129042258/http://memim.com/h3-airstrike.html|archive-date=29 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Operation H3 map.png|thumb|right|alt=A map of Iraq showing the aircraft involved and their route.|Map of the operation, showing the aircraft involved and their route.]]\n\nThe operation began at 10:30am of 4 April 1981. A formation of eight F-4 Phantoms (including six F-4Es and two F-4Ds), accompanied by two airborne reserves, departed from [[Hamedan Air Base]] (TAB 3) and proceeded towards [[Urmia Lake]] and then, after refueling in friendly airspace, crossed into Iraq, while the two reserve aircraft returned. A pair of F-14 Tomcats patrolled the area hours before and after the strike began to counter any interception attempts by the Iraqi Air Force. Meanwhile, three [[Northrop F-5|Northrop F-5E]]s from [[Tabriz Air Base]] ([[TFB.2]]) performed diversionary attacks on [[Kirkuk Air Base|Hurriya Air Base]] near [[Kirkuk]], with unknown results, but certainly distracting Iraqis away from the Phantoms.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /><ref name=jamaran>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaran.ir/fa/NewsContent-id_23309.aspx|title=\u0639\u0645\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0686-3 \u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u067e\u06cc\u0686\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0646\u0642\u0634\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062d\u0645\u0644\u0647 \u0647\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a|publisher=}}</ref> The C-130H was flying near the Iran\u2013Iraq border. Some time earlier, the two tankers, which already had been sent to Syria, had taken off from a Syrian airport, and then clandestinely diverted from international commercial corridors in total radio silence, while apparently being bound for Iran. Flying at a very low altitude over southern Turkey and eastern Syria, they crossed mountainous northwestern Iraq and finally joined the Phantoms over the western Iraqi desert. Each Phantom refueled four times from the tankers, at the altitude of 300&nbsp;ft (100&nbsp;m), which was risky and far below any safety standards<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /> (aerial refueling is normally performed at 22,000&nbsp;ft).<ref name=aja /> This was done to avoid detection by Iraqi radars; however, the fighters briefly appeared several times on the radars, but were mistaken for Turkish aircraft patrolling the border. Colonel Izadseta supervised the operation from a command Boeing 747 that was in Syria's airspace. The Syrian [[Palmyra Airport|airport at Palmyra]] could also be used for possible emergency landing.\n\nWhile approaching the airbases, the Phantoms split their formation into two groups, ''Alvand'' and ''Alborz''. This allowed attacks to come from several directions on the H3 complex. They bombed all three airfields within the H-3 complex.<ref name=Bishop2014 /> Achieving complete surprise, the fighters made several passes against all three airbases. Both runways at Al-Walid were targeted in order to prevent any Iraqi aircraft from taking off. Cluster bombs of the second group of Phantoms damaged three large [[hangar]]s. The Phantoms were able to make multiple attacks on multiple targets with cannon fire. By the end of the second group's attack the Iraqi military forces had not responded with a coordinated counter-attack. Effective [[anti-aircraft]] fire was also impaired due to the surprise attack. Iraqi aircraft were scrambled in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept the Iranian force.\n\nAfter the attack, the Iranian formation turned back towards its own bases. Iranian military officials stated that all Iranian Phantoms were undamaged during the attack.<ref name=\"target p7-8\">Cooper and Bishop ''Air Enthusiast'' March/April 2004, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Casualties===\nThe IRIAF claimed it destroyed a total of three [[Antonov An-12|Antonov An-12BP]] transports, a [[Tupolev Tu-16]] bomber, four [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]s, five [[Sukhoi Su-17|Sukhoi Su-20/22s]], eight [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]]s, two [[Dassault Mirage F1|Dassault Mirage F1EQs]] (delivered only weeks earlier) and four helicopters,<ref name=Bishop2014>{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Farzad|title=Iranian F-4 Phantom II Units in Combat|date=2014|publisher=Osprey Pub.|location=London|isbn=9781782007081|page=15}}</ref> as well as damaging eleven others beyond repair, including two Tu-16 bombers. Two Iraqi pilots and fourteen personnel were killed, together with three Egyptian and an East German officer, while 19 Iraqis, four Egyptians, and two Jordanians were badly injured. This strike degraded Iraq's capability to retaliate.<ref name=\"Fire\">Fire in the Hills: Iranian and Iraqi Battles of Autumn 1982, by Tom Cooper & Farzad Bishop, 9 Sept. 2003</ref>\n\nAccording to Iranian intelligence, prior to the attack there were at least two squadrons equipped with ten [[Tupolev Tu-22|Tupolev Tu-22B]] and at least six [[Tupolev Tu-16]] heavy bombers, as well as two other units with MiG-23BNs and Su-20s, which were hidden in the hangars. This has been disputed by Iraqi officials. Iraqi sources claimed that only a single MiG-21 was damaged by the attack; that the damaged hangars were empty at the time of the attack; and that its Tu-22s and Tu-16s were stationed at [[Al-Taqaddum Air Base|Tammuz Airbase]] due to the ongoing war with Iran. Iraq claimed that the bombers were stationed at Tammuz until they were retired from the Iraqi Air Force in the late 1980s, and then were bombed in 1991 during the [[Gulf War]].<ref>[http://www.algardenia.com/thaqafawaadab/9186-1931-2003.html ''The Power and the Strategic Role of the Iraqi Air Force 1931-2003''] Lt.

After a gruelling selection process within the fighter corps of the [[IRIAF]], a total of 20 [[fighter pilots]] were selected to participate. Almost all of them, had at least 10 years of service and combat experience, and later on would become national heroes during the war.
