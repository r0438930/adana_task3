Of the ten, nine were killed (including the other crewman in submarine ''HA. 19'', [[Chief warrant officer|CWO]] Kiyoshi Inagaki.)  Sakamaki was chosen for the mission due to his large number of siblings.\n\nAfter several attempts to enter Pearl Harbor, Sakamaki attempted to [[scuttling|scuttle]] his disabled submarine, which had been trapped on a reef off [[Waimanalo Beach]], [[Oahu]]. When the explosives failed to go off, he swam to the bottom of the submarine to investigate the cause of the failure and became unconscious due to a lack of oxygen. The book ''Attack on Pearl Harbor'' claims that his submarine hit four coral reefs and sank. Sakamaki was found by a U.S. soldier, [[David Akui]], and was taken into military custody. When he awoke, he found himself in a hospital under U.S. armed guard. Sakamaki became the first Japanese [[prisoner of war]] in U.S. captivity during [[World War II]] and was stricken from Japanese records and officially ceased to exist. His submarine was captured intact and was subsequently taken on tours across the United States to encourage [[Series E bond|war bond]] purchases.<ref name=\"nytimes1\">Goldstein, Richard (December 21, 1999).
