the eastern boundary of the [[Basin and Range Province]]. The major [[active fault]] zone is the [[Fault (geology)#Dip-slip faults|normal]] [[Wasatch Fault]] that throws down to the west. The footwall (upthrown part) is formed by the [[Wasatch Range]] with part of the [[Great Basin]] lying in the hanging-wall (downthrown part), at one time filled by [[Lake Bonneville]], with the [[Great Salt Lake]] forming the largest remnant. The fault zone is broken up into six segments that appear to rupture separately.
