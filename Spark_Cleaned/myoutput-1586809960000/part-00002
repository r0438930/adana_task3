The consolidations led to the formation of a nationwide film distribution system.\n\nIn 1917, Zukor acquired 50% of [[Lewis J. Selznick]]'s Select Pictures which led Selznick's publicity to wane. Later, however, Selznick bought out Zukor's share of Select Pictures.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety109-1933-01#page/n283/mode/1up|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Lewis J.

He signed many of the leading early stars, including [[Mary Pickford]], [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle]], Marguerite Clark, Pauline Frederick, Douglas Fairbanks, Gloria Swanson, Rudolph Valentino, and Wallace Reid. With so many important players, Zukor also pioneered \"[[Block booking|Block Booking]]\" for Paramount Pictures, which meant that an exhibitor who wanted a particular star's films had to buy a year's worth of other Paramount productions. It was this system that gave Paramount a leading position in the 1920s and 1930s, but which led the government to pursue it on antitrust grounds for more than 20 years.\n\nZukor was the driving force behind Paramount's success. Through the teens and twenties, he also built the Publix Theatres Corporation, a chain of nearly 2000 screens. He also ran two production studios, one in Astoria, New York (now the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]]) and the other in Hollywood, California.\n\nIn 1926, Zukor hired independent producer B. P. Schulberg, who had an unerring eye for new talent, to run the new West Coast operations. They purchased the Robert Brunton Studios, a 26-acre facility at 5451 Marathon Street for US$1 million.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> In 1927, Famous Players-Lasky took the name Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation. Three years later, because of the importance of the Publix Theatres, it became Paramount Publix Corporation.\n\nZukor was now turning out 60 features a year. He made deals to show them all in theaters controlled by [[Loew's|Loew's Enterprises]], and also continued to add more theaters to his own chain. By 1920 he was in a position to charge what he wished for film rentals. Thus he pioneered the concept, now the accepted practice in the film industry, by which the distributor charges the exhibitor a percentage of box-office receipts.\n\nZukor, ever the impresario,  bought a huge plot of ground at Broadway and 43d Street, over objections of his board of directors, to build the Paramount Theater and office building, a 39-story building that had its grand opening in 1926. He managed to keep stars like Pola Negri, Gloria Swanson, and most important of all, Mary Pickford, under contract and happy to stay at Paramount.   At one point Miss Pickford told Zukor: \"You know, for years I've dreamed of making $20,000 a year before I was 20, and I'll be 20 very soon.\"\n\n\"I could take a hint,\" Zukor recalled wryly. \"She got the $20,000, and before long I was paying her $100,000 a year. Mary was a terrific businessman.\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\nZukor was, primarily, also a businessman. \"He did not take the same personal, down-to-the-last-detail interest in the making of his movies that producer-executives such as Samuel Goldwyn and Louis B. Mayer did,\" wrote ''The New York Times'' in Zukor's obit at the age of 103.   He became an early investor in radio, taking a 50 percent interest in the new [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] in 1928, but selling it within a few years.\n\nPartner Lasky hung on until 1932,  when Paramount nearly collapsed in the Depression years, and he was blamed for this and tossed out.  The following year, Paramount went into receivership.  Zukor's over-expansion and use of overvalued Paramount stock for purchases were ultimately at fault. A bank-mandated reorganization team kept the company intact, and, miraculously, Zukor was kept on. In 1935, Paramount-Publix theater chain went bankrupt. In 1936, Barney Balaban became president, and Zukor was bumped up to chairman of the board. In this role, Zukor reorganized the company as Paramount Pictures, Inc. and was able to successfully bring the studio out of bankruptcy.\n\nHe eventually spent most of his time in New York, but spent the winter months in  Hollywood to check on his studio.  He served as president until 1936 when he was elevated to chairman of the board. He retired from Paramount Pictures in 1959 and in 1964 stepped down as chairman and assumed Chairman Emeritus status,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,875915,00.html |title=Personalities: Jun. 12, 1964 - TIME |publisher=Content.time.com |date=1964-06-12 |accessdate=2019-09-14}}</ref> a position he held up until his death at the age of 103 in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. \n\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1897, he married Lottie Kaufman;<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0107.html New York Times: \"Adolph Zukor Is Dead at 103; Built Paramount Movie Empire\" by ALBIN KREBS] June 11, 1976</ref> they had two children, Eugene J.

Schulberg, who had an unerring eye for new talent, to run the new West Coast operations. They purchased the Robert Brunton Studios, a 26-acre facility at 5451 Marathon Street for US$1 million.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> In 1927, Famous Players-Lasky took the name Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation. Three years later, because of the importance of the Publix Theatres, it became Paramount Publix Corporation.\n\nZukor was now turning out 60 features a year. He made deals to show them all in theaters controlled by [[Loew's|Loew's Enterprises]], and also continued to add more theaters to his own chain. By 1920 he was in a position to charge what he wished for film rentals. Thus he pioneered the concept, now the accepted practice in the film industry, by which the distributor charges the exhibitor a percentage of box-office receipts.\n\nZukor, ever the impresario,  bought a huge plot of ground at Broadway and 43d Street, over objections of his board of directors, to build the Paramount Theater and office building, a 39-story building that had its grand opening in 1926. He managed to keep stars like Pola Negri, Gloria Swanson, and most important of all, Mary Pickford, under contract and happy to stay at Paramount.   At one point Miss Pickford told Zukor: \"You know, for years I've dreamed of making $20,000 a year before I was 20, and I'll be 20 very soon.\"\n\n\"I could take a hint,\" Zukor recalled wryly. \"She got the $20,000, and before long I was paying her $100,000 a year. Mary was a terrific businessman.\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\nZukor was, primarily, also a businessman. \"He did not take the same personal, down-to-the-last-detail interest in the making of his movies that producer-executives such as Samuel Goldwyn and Louis B. Mayer did,\" wrote ''The New York Times'' in Zukor's obit at the age of 103.   He became an early investor in radio, taking a 50 percent interest in the new [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] in 1928, but selling it within a few years.\n\nPartner Lasky hung on until 1932,  when Paramount nearly collapsed in the Depression years, and he was blamed for this and tossed out.  The following year, Paramount went into receivership.  Zukor's over-expansion and use of overvalued Paramount stock for purchases were ultimately at fault. A bank-mandated reorganization team kept the company intact, and, miraculously, Zukor was kept on. In 1935, Paramount-Publix theater chain went bankrupt. In 1936, Barney Balaban became president, and Zukor was bumped up to chairman of the board. In this role, Zukor reorganized the company as Paramount Pictures, Inc. and was able to successfully bring the studio out of bankruptcy.\n\nHe eventually spent most of his time in New York, but spent the winter months in  Hollywood to check on his studio.  He served as president until 1936 when he was elevated to chairman of the board. He retired from Paramount Pictures in 1959 and in 1964 stepped down as chairman and assumed Chairman Emeritus status,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,875915,00.html |title=Personalities: Jun. 12, 1964 - TIME |publisher=Content.time.com |date=1964-06-12 |accessdate=2019-09-14}}</ref> a position he held up until his death at the age of 103 in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. \n\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1897, he married Lottie Kaufman;<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0107.html New York Times: \"Adolph Zukor Is Dead at 103; Built Paramount Movie Empire\" by ALBIN KREBS] June 11, 1976</ref> they had two children, Eugene J.
