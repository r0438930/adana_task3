The county was named after [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]], a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] military officer who helped train the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nThe [[county seat]] is [[Angola, Indiana|Angola]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The area was developed for agriculture in the 19th century and has many natural resources. The county contains a state park and 105 lakes of various sizes.  Some of the larger lakes are [[Lake James (Indiana)|Lake James]], [[Lake George (Steuben County, Indiana)|Lake George]], Clear Lake, Jimmerson Lake, Lake Gage, and Crooked Lake.  As of 2010, the county population was 34,185.<ref name=\"census-quickfacts\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/18/18151.html\n  |title=Steuben County QuickFacts\n  |accessdate=2011-09-25\n  |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}</ref>\n\nSteuben County comprises the Angola, IN [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\nThis area was historically occupied by the [[Potawatomi]] people, who were one of the three tribes in the [[Council of Three Fires]]. Typically they lived in highly decentralized bands. Treaties signed by some leaders with United States representatives ceded large areas of their territory to the US.\n\nSteuben County was officially created by European Americans in 1837 from [[LaGrange County, Indiana|LaGrange County]], and named for [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron Frederick von Steuben]], an officer of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

His daughter Winona married Negnaska and lived in what is now Indiana. She was executed in the 1830s by her husband's people after she killed Negnaska for selling her pony.<ref name=\"Winona Story\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=gCDiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA582 Fuller, George Newman and Beeson, Lewis]''Michigan History Vol. 6'' Lansing: Michigan State Historical Society, 1922. p. 582</ref> Winona's husband had pledged his rifle to Aaron B. Goodwin of [[Fremont, Indiana]] for the use of a 5-gallon keg. The Indians had the keg filled with whiskey at Nichols' store in Jamestown, and he took all the money they had. Negnaska sold his wife Winona's pony in order to pawn his rifle. Winona owned the pony outright, either as a gift from her father or having bought it with her own money. She killed Negnaska in anger for selling what was hers. Winona was held by the tribe for a few hours, until her husband's nearest relative arrived to execute her. As was their custom, he stabbed her to the heart as she had her husband.<ref name=\"Winona History\"/>\n\nJohn D. Barnard and Sheldon Havens were said to have encountered the Potawatomi group after the execution; they helped them move the bodies to a nearby grave that had been dug. The Indians did not bury the bodies until after the white men were out of sight. But Dr. B.F. Sheldon found out about it and exhumed the bodies for dissection a few days later, outraging the mourning Potawatomi. About two weeks later some Potawatomi returned the keg to Goodwin and tried to retrieve Negnaska's rifle, but Goodwin pretended not to know the man had been killed and refused to release the rifle to his friends.<ref name=\"Winona History\">[https://archive.org/stream/historyofsteuben00inte/historyofsteuben00inte_djvu.txt ''History of Steuben County, Indiana''], Chicago: Inter-state Publishing

Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>\n\n'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president.

In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>\n\n'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]].

Typically they lived in highly decentralized bands. Treaties signed by some leaders with United States representatives ceded large areas of their territory to the US.\n\nSteuben County was officially created by European Americans in 1837 from [[LaGrange County, Indiana|LaGrange County]], and named for [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron Frederick von Steuben]], an officer of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

His daughter Winona married Negnaska and lived in what is now Indiana. She was executed in the 1830s by her husband's people after she killed Negnaska for selling her pony.<ref name=\"Winona Story\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=gCDiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA582 Fuller, George Newman and Beeson, Lewis]''Michigan History Vol. 6'' Lansing: Michigan State Historical Society, 1922. p. 582</ref> Winona's husband had pledged his rifle to Aaron B. Goodwin of [[Fremont, Indiana]] for the use of a 5-gallon keg. The Indians had the keg filled with whiskey at Nichols' store in Jamestown, and he took all the money they had. Negnaska sold his wife Winona's pony in order to pawn his rifle. Winona owned the pony outright, either as a gift from her father or having bought it with her own money. She killed Negnaska in anger for selling what was hers. Winona was held by the tribe for a few hours, until her husband's nearest relative arrived to execute her. As was their custom, he stabbed her to the heart as she had her husband.<ref name=\"Winona History\"/>\n\t\nJohn D. Barnard and Sheldon Havens were said to have encountered the Potawatomi group after the execution; they helped them move the bodies to a nearby grave that had been dug. The Indians did not bury the bodies until after the white men were out of sight. But Dr. B.F. Sheldon found out about it and exhumed the bodies for dissection a few days later, outraging the mourning Potawatomi. About two weeks later some Potawatomi returned the keg to Goodwin and tried to retrieve Negnaska's rifle, but Goodwin pretended not to know the man had been killed and refused to release the rifle to his friends.<ref name=\"Winona History\">[https://archive.org/stream/historyofsteuben00inte/historyofsteuben00inte_djvu.txt ''History of Steuben County, Indiana''], Chicago: Inter-state Publishing

The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>\n\n'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]].
