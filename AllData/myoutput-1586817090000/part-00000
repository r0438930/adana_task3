It stars [[Anthony Perkins]], [[Janet Leigh]], [[John Gavin]], [[Vera Miles]], and [[Martin Balsam]], and was based on the [[Psycho (novel)|1959 novel of the same name]] by [[Robert Bloch]]. The film centers on an encounter between a secretary, [[Marion Crane]] (Leigh), who ends up at a secluded motel after stealing money from her employer, and the motel's owner-manager, [[Norman Bates]] (Perkins), and its aftermath.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/24944/Psycho/full-synopsis.html|title=Psycho (1960) - Full Synopsis - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|language=en|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Psycho'' was seen as a departure from Hitchcock's previous film ''[[North by Northwest]]'', having been filmed on a low budget, in black-and-white, and by a television crew. The film initially received mixed reviews, but outstanding [[box office|box-office]] returns prompted critical reevaluation. ''Psycho'' was nominated for four [[33rd Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Leigh and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Hitchcock.\n\n''Psycho'' is now considered one of Hitchcock's best films<ref>''Psycho'' is the top listed Hitchcock film in ''The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time'' by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', and the highest Hitchcock film on [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies]].</ref> and praised as a major work of cinematic art by international film critics and scholars.

In 1992, the [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a lunchtime tryst in a [[Phoenix, Arizona]] hotel, real-estate secretary [[Marion Crane]] and her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, discuss how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client leaves a $40,000 ({{Inflation|US|40000|1959|r=-3|fmt=eq}})  cash payment on a property. Marion's boss asks her to deposit the money in the bank and allows her to leave work early after she complains of a headache. Once home, she decides to steal the money and drive to Fairvale, California, where Sam lives.\n\nEn route to Fairvale, Marion stops her car on the side of the road and falls asleep. She is awakened the next morning by a state patrol trooper who follows Marion after questioning her and growing suspicious about her skittish behavior. Marion stops at a [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], California automobile dealership and trades in her [[Ford Mainline]], with its Arizona license plates, for a [[Ford Custom]] 300 with California tags. The officer spots Marion at the car dealership and eyes her suspiciously as she abruptly drives away.\n\nDuring a heavy rainstorm, Marion stops for the night at the Bates Motel. The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]], invites her to share a light dinner after she checks in. She accepts his invitation but overhears an argument between Norman and [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] about bringing a woman into their [[Carpenter Gothic|Gothic]] home, which sits perched above the motel. Instead they eat in the motel parlor, where he tells her about his life with his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids him to have a life apart from her.\n\nMoved by Norman's story, Marion decides to drive back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money, which she hides in a folded newspaper on the nightstand. As she showers, a shadowy figure stabs her to death. After seeing blood, Norman panics and runs to Marion's room, where he discovers her body. He cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions \u2013 including (unbeknownst to him) the stolen money \u2013 into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.\n\nA week later, Marion's sister [[Lila Crane|Lila]] arrives in Fairvale and confronts Sam about Marion's whereabouts. Private investigator Milton Arbogast approaches them and confirms that Marion is wanted for stealing the $40,000. Arbogast sleuths local motels and discovers Marion spent a night at the Bates Motel. He questions Norman, whose stammering, skittishness and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicion. After Norman implies that Marion met his mother, Arbogast asks to speak with her, but Norman refuses to allow it. Arbogast updates Sam and Lila about his search for Marion and promises to phone again soon. He goes to the Bates' home in search of Norman's mother; as he reaches the top of the stairs, a mysterious figure stabs him to death.\n\nWhen Lila and Sam do not hear from Arbogast, Sam visits the motel. Sam sees a figure in the house who he assumes is Mrs. Bates, but she ignores his knocking. Lila and Sam visit the local deputy sheriff, who informs them that Mrs. Bates died in a murder-suicide ten years ago. The sheriff concludes that Arbogast lied to Sam and Lila so he could pursue Marion and the money. Convinced that some ill has befallen Arbogast, Lila and Sam drive to the motel. Norman carries his mother from her room and hides her in the fruit cellar.\n\nAt the motel, Sam distracts Norman by engaging in conversation while Lila cases the property and sneaks inside the house. After Sam grills him, Norman becomes agitated, knocks Sam out, and rushes to the house. Lila hides in the cellar, where she finds Mrs. Bates in a chair. Lila turns her around and discovers she is a mummified corpse. Lila screams as Norman runs into the cellar, holding a [[chef's knife]] and wearing his mother's clothes and a wig. Before Norman can attack Lila, Sam \u2013 having regained consciousness \u2013 subdues him.\n\nAt the courthouse, a psychiatrist explains that Norman murdered Mrs. Bates and her lover ten years ago out of jealousy. Unable to bear the guilt, he stole her corpse and began to treat it as if she were still alive. He recreated his mother in his own mind as an [[multiple personality disorder|alternate personality]], dressing in her clothes and talking to himself in her voice. This \"Mother\" personality is as jealous and possessive as Mrs. Bates was while alive: whenever Norman feels attracted to a woman, \"Mother\" kills her. As \"Mother\", Norman killed two young girls before stabbing Marion and Arbogast to death. The psychiatrist says the \"Mother\" personality has taken permanent hold of Norman's mind. While Norman sits in a holding cell, \"Mother\"{{'}}s voice-over protests that the murders were Norman's doing. Marion's car is towed from the swamp.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Norman Bates in \"Psycho\" (1960).jpg|thumb|[[Anthony Perkins]]' performance as [[Norman Bates]] won him considerable critical praise.]]\n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as [[Norman Bates]]\n* [[Janet Leigh]] as [[Marion Crane]]\n* [[Vera Miles]] as [[Lila Crane]]\n* [[John Gavin]] as Sam Loomis\n* [[Martin Balsam]] as Private Investigator Milton Arbogast\n* [[John McIntire]] as Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers\n* [[Simon Oakland]] as Dr. Richmond\n* [[Frank Albertson]] as Tom Cassidy\n* [[Pat Hitchcock]] as Caroline\n* [[Vaughn Taylor (actor)|Vaughn Taylor]] as George Lowery\n* [[Lurene Tuttle]] as Mrs. Chambers\n* [[John Anderson (actor)|John Anderson]] as California Charlie\n* [[Mort Mills]] as Highway Patrol Officer\n* [[Francis De Sales (actor)|Francis De Sales]] as Deputy District Attorney Alan Deats (uncredited)\n* [[George Eldredge]] as Police Chief James Mitchell (uncredited)\n* [[Robert Osborne]] as Police Guard (uncredited)\n* [[Ted Knight]] as Police Guard (uncredited)\n* [[Virginia Gregg]], [[Paul Jasmin]], and [[Jeanette Nolan]] as the voice of [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma \"Mother\" Bates]] (uncredited).

Each had deceased, domineering mothers, had sealed off a room in their home as a shrine to her, and dressed in women's clothes. However, unlike Bates, Gein is not strictly considered a [[serial killer]], having been charged with murder only twice.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref>\n[[File:Psycho House, Motel and car composite.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.59|The ''Psycho'' set on the [[Universal Studios Lot]], featuring a [[Ford Custom 300]] similar to that driven by [[Janet Leigh]] in the film, is now part of the studio tour at the [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] theme park.]]\n[[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's long-time assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the novel in his \"Criminals at Large\" column and decided to show the book to her employer, even though studio readers at [[Paramount Pictures]] had already rejected its premise for a film.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref>  Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> and reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to preserve the novel's surprises.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Hitchcock, who had come to face genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own, was seeking new material to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount, ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. He disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives balked at Hitchcock's proposal and refused to provide his usual budget.<ref name=\"Rebello23\"/> In response, Hitchcock offered to film ''Psycho'' quickly and cheaply in black and white using his ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' television series crew. Paramount executives rejected this cost-conscious approach, claiming their sound stages were booked even though the industry was in a slump. Hitchcock countered he would personally finance the project and film it at Universal-International using his Shamley Productions crew if Paramount would merely distribute. In lieu of his usual $250,000 director's fee he proposed a 60% stake in the film negative. This combined offer was accepted and Hitchcock went ahead in spite of naysaying from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\n===Novel adaptation===\nJames P.

Stefano found the character of Norman Bates\u2014who, in the book, is middle-aged, overweight, and more overtly unstable\u2014unsympathetic, but became more intrigued when Hitchcock suggested casting Anthony Perkins.<ref name=\"leigh3637\"/> Stefano eliminated Bates' drinking,<ref name=\"Rebello 1990 39\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=39}}</ref> which evidently necessitated removing Bates' \"becoming\" the Mother personality when in a drunken stupor.

Smith notes that, \"Her story occupies only two of the novel's 17 chapters. Hitchcock and Stefano expanded this to nearly half the narrative\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|2009|p=15}}</ref> He likewise notes there is no hotel tryst between Marion and Sam in the novel. For Stefano, the conversation between Marion and Norman in the hotel parlor in which she displays a maternal sympathy towards him makes it possible for the audience to switch their sympathies towards Norman Bates after Marion's murder.<ref name=\"screenwriting-stefano\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/wiki/Creative_Screenwriting_-_Interview_with_Joseph_Stefano |title=Interview in Creative ScreenWriting Journal.

Stefano wanted to give the audience \"indications that something was quite wrong, but it could not be spelled out or overdone.\"<ref name=\"screenwriting-stefano\"/> In his book of interviews with Hitchcock, [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] notes that the novel \"cheats\" by having extended conversations between Norman and \"Mother\" and stating what Mother is \"doing\" at various given moments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Truffaut|1967|p=268}}</ref>\n\nThe first name of the female protagonist was changed from Mary to Marion, since a real Mary Crane existed in Phoenix.<ref name=\"leigh3334\">Leigh, pp. 33\u201334</ref> Also changed is the novel's budding romance between Sam and Lila. Hitchcock preferred to focus the audience's attention on the solution to the mystery,<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|2009|p=16}}</ref> and Stefano thought such a relationship would make Sam Loomis seem cheap.<ref name=\"screenwriting-stefano\"/> Instead of having Sam explain Norman's [[psychopathology|pathology]] to Lila, the film uses a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Leigh, 39\">Leigh, p. 39</ref> (Stefano was in therapy dealing with his relationship with his own mother while writing the script.)<ref>{{Harvnb|Caminer|Gallagher|1996}}</ref> The novel is more violent than the film; for instance, Marion is beheaded in the shower as opposed to being stabbed to death.<ref name=\"dvddoc\"/> Minor changes include changing Marion's telltale earring found after her death to a scrap of paper that failed to flush down the toilet. This provided some shock effect, since toilets were virtually never seen in American cinema in the 1960s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=47}}</ref> The location of Arbogast's death was moved from the foyer to the stairwell.

The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which \"Mother\" is discovered required a complicated coordinating of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila Crane)  hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point.

Green, working with storyboard artist Saul Bass' drawings only while Hitchcock was incapacitated with the common cold. However, upon viewing the [[dailies]] of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them. He claimed they were \"no good\" because they did not portray \"an innocent person but a sinister man who was going up those stairs\".<ref name=\"Truffaut\">{{Harvnb|Truffaut|1967|p=273}}</ref> Hitchcock later re-shot the scene, though a little of the cut footage made its way into the film. Filming the murder of Arbogast proved problematic owing to the overhead camera angle necessary to hide the film's twist.

When interviewing Hitchcock in 1967, [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] asked about the extent of Bass' contribution, to which Hitchcock replied that in addition to the titles, Bass had provided storyboards for the Arbogast murder (which he claimed to have rejected), but made no mention of Bass providing storyboards for the shower scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://notcoming.com/saulbass/caps_psycho.php|title=Psycho: The Title Credits|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> According to Bill Krohn's ''Hitchcock At Work'', Bass' first claim to have directed the scene was in 1970, when he provided a magazine with 48 drawings used as storyboards as proof of his contribution.<ref name=\"Krohn\">{{Harvnb|Krohn|2003}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\nKrohn's analysis of the production of ''Psycho'' in his book ''Hitchcock at Work'', while refuting Bass' claims for directing the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene\u2014most notably, the fact that the killer appears as a silhouette, and details such as the close-ups of the slashing knife, Leigh's desperate outstretched arm, the shower curtain being torn off its hooks, and the transition from the hole of the drainage pipe to Marion Crane's dead eyes. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.<ref name=\"Krohn\"/>\n\nKrohn's research also notes that Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a [[Mitchell Camera|BNC Mitchell]], the other a handheld French ''[[Eclair (camera)|\u00c9clair]]'' camera which [[Orson Welles]] had used in ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958). In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a [[Moviola]] on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor [[George Tomasini]] worked on with Hitchcock's advice, however did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass' storyboards.<ref name=\"Krohn\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Donald Spoto]] in ''The Dark Side of Genius'', Hitchcock's wife, [[Alma Reville]], spotted a blooper in one of the last screenings of ''Psycho'' before its official release: after Marion was supposedly dead, one could see her blink. According to [[Patricia Hitchcock]], talking in Laurent Bouzereau's \"making of\" documentary, Alma spotted that Leigh's character appeared to take a breath. In either case, the postmortem activity was edited out and was never seen by audiences.<ref name=\"dvddoc\"/> Although Marion's eyes should be dilated after her death, the contact lenses necessary for this effect would have required six weeks of acclimation to wear them, so Hitchcock decided to forgo them.<ref>Leigh, pp. 176, 42</ref>\n\nIt is often claimed that, despite its graphic nature, the shower scene never once shows a knife puncturing flesh.<ref>Leigh, p. 169</ref><ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=December 6, 1998 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=December 1, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Harmetz, Aljean |title=Janet Leigh, 77, Shower Taker of 'Psycho,' Is Dead |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 5, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/05/movies/05leigh.html?ex=1254715200&en=596717cddaea56ef&ei=5090 |accessdate=December 1, 2006 |authorlink=Aljean Harmetz}}</ref> However, a frame by frame analysis of the sequence shows one shot in which the knife appears to penetrate Leigh's abdomen, but the effect may have been created by lighting and reverse motion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/blog/?p=274 |title=8 frames of \"Psycho\" |date=May 8, 2008 |work=hitchcockwiki.com |accessdate=April 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409193048/http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/blog/?p=274 |archivedate=April 9, 2010 }}</ref> Leigh herself was so affected by this scene when she saw it, that she no longer took showers unless she absolutely had to; she would lock all the doors and windows and would leave the bathroom and shower door open.<ref>Leigh, p. 131</ref> She never realized until she first watched the film \"how vulnerable and defenseless one is\".<ref name=\"dvddoc\"/>\n\nLeigh and Hitchcock fully discussed what the scene meant:\n{{Quote\n|text=Marion had decided to go back to Phoenix, come clean, and take the consequence, so when she stepped into the bathtub it was as if she were stepping into the baptismal waters.

It was unprecedented in its depiction of sexuality and violence, right from the opening scene in which Sam and Marion are shown as lovers sharing the same bed, with Marion in a bra.<ref name=\"Psychof\" /> In the Production Code standards of that time, unmarried couples shown in the same bed would have been taboo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voxy.co.nz/entertainment/psycho-%E2%80%93-classic-hitchcock-horror-turns-50/1117/51910|title=Psycho \u2013 Classic Hitchcock Horror Turns 50|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAnother controversial issue was the [[gender bending]] element.

The viewer is unaware of the [[gender dysphoria]] until, at the end of the movie, it is revealed that Bates is a [[crossdresser]] in the [[attempted murder]] of Lila. At the station, Sam asks why Bates was dressed that way. The police officer, ignorant of Bates' split personality, bluntly utters that Bates is a [[transvestite]]. The psychiatrist corrects him and says, \"Not exactly\". He explains that Bates believes that he is his own mother when he dresses in her clothes.<ref name=\"Oever2012\">{{cite book|last=Oever|first=Roel van den|title=Mama's Boy: Momism and Homophobia in Postwar American Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1MDVe9B0UEC&pg=PA111 |accessdate=June 14, 2018 |date=September 24, 2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=9781137274052 |pages=111\u2013113 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 1990 book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', the censors in charge of enforcing the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, and those who had not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in.<ref name=\"Leigh112\">Leigh, p. 112</ref> The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since board members did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.<ref name=\"Leigh112\" />\n\nAnother cause of concern for the censors was that Marion was shown flushing a toilet, with its contents (torn-up note paper) fully visible.

In Britain, the [[BBFC]] requested cuts to stabbing sounds and visible nude shots, and in New Zealand the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands was objected to. In Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast, and a shot of Norman's mother's corpse were removed.<ref name=\"leigh105106\">Leigh, pp. 105\u20136</ref>\n\nThe most controversial move was Hitchcock's \"no late admission\" policy for the film, which was unusual for the time. It was not entirely original as [[Henri-Georges Clouzot|Clouzot]] had done the same in France for ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Diabolique]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=21}}</ref> Hitchcock thought that if people entered the theater late and never saw the star actress Janet Leigh, they would feel cheated.<ref name=\"Leigh9697\" /> At first theater owners opposed the idea, claiming that they would lose business. However, after the first day, the owners enjoyed long lines of people waiting to see the film.<ref name=\"Leigh9697\" />\n\n==Promotion==\n[[File:Psycho Theatrical Trailer (1960).webm|thumb|left|thumbtime=364|Original trailer for ''Psycho'']]\nHitchcock did most of the promotion on his own, forbidding Leigh and Perkins to make the usual television, radio, and print interviews for fear of them revealing the plot.<ref>Leigh, p. 95</ref> Even critics were not given private screenings but rather had to see the film with the general public, which, despite possibly affecting their reviews,<ref name=\"leigh105106\"/> certainly preserved the secret.\n\nThe film's original [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] features a jovial Hitchcock taking the viewer on a tour of the set, and almost giving away plot details before stopping himself. It is \"tracked\" with Herrmann's ''Psycho'' theme, but also jovial music from Hitchcock's comedy ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]''; most of Hitchcock's dialogue is post-synchronized. The trailer was made after completion of the film, and since Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had [[Vera Miles]] don a blonde wig and scream loudly as he pulled the shower curtain back in the bathroom sequence of the preview. Since the title, \"''Psycho''\", instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years. However, a freeze-frame analysis clearly reveals that it is Miles and not Leigh in the shower during the trailer.<ref name=\"Leigh9697\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe film was so successful that it was reissued to theaters in 1965. \n[[File:Psycho 1960 Lobby Card.jpg|thumb|<center>Lobby card for a 1969 reissue.</center>]]\nA year later, [[CBS]] purchased the television rights for $450,000.

As a result of the [[Apollo 1|Apollo pad fire]] of January 27, 1967, the network washed its hands of ''Psycho''.<ref name=\"Leigh187\">Leigh, p. 187</ref>\n\nShortly afterward Paramount included the film in its first syndicated package of post-1950 movies, \"Portfolio I\".

This, along with box office numbers, led to a reconsideration of the film by critics, and it eventually received a large amount of praise. It broke box-office records in Japan and the rest of Asia, France, Britain, South America, the United States, and Canada, and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period.<ref name=\"leigh99102\"/> It was the most profitable black-and-white sound film ever made,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and Hitchcock personally realized well in excess of $15 million. He then swapped his rights to ''Psycho'' and his TV anthology for 150,000 shares of [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], making him the third largest shareholder in MCA Inc., and his own boss at Universal, in theory; however, this did not stop them from interfering with his later films.<ref>Stephen Rebello, ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, Soft Skull Press, Berkeley, 1990.</ref><ref>Leigh, p. 141</ref> ''Psycho'' was, by a large margin, the most profitable film of Hitchcock's career, earning over $32 million for the studio on release, and $18 million by the end of the year. Around the time of the run's end, the film had grossed $50 million in domestic theaters.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film shattered attendance records at the [[London]] Plaza [[Movie theatre|Cinema]], but nearly all British critics gave it poor reviews, questioning Hitchcock's taste and judgment. Reasons cited for this were the critics' late screenings, forcing them to rush their reviews, their dislike of the gimmicky promotion, and Hitchcock's [[expatriate]] status.<ref name=\"leigh103106\">Leigh, pp. 103\u2013106</ref> Perhaps thanks to the public's response and Hitchcock's efforts at promoting it, the critics did a re-review, and the film was praised.

The site's critical consensus states, \"Infamous for its shower scene, but immortal for its contribution to the horror genre. Because ''Psycho'' was filmed with tact, grace, and art, Hitchcock didn't just create modern horror, he validated it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/psycho//|title=Psycho (1960)|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Themes and style==\n===Subversion of romance through irony===\nIn ''Psycho'', Hitchcock subverts the romantic elements that are seen in most of his work. The film is instead ironic as it presents \"clarity and fulfillment\" of romance. The past is central to the film; the main characters \"struggle to understand and resolve destructive personal histories\" and ultimately fail.<ref name=\"brill200\u2013201\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|pp=200\u2013201}}</ref> Lesley Brill writes, \"The inexorable forces of past sins and mistakes crush hopes for regeneration and present happiness.\" The crushed hope is highlighted by the death of the protagonist, Marion Crane, halfway through the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=223}}</ref> Marion is like [[Persephone]] of [[Greek mythology]], who is abducted temporarily from the world of the living. The myth does not sustain with Marion, who dies hopelessly in her room at the Bates Motel. The room is wallpapered with floral print like Persephone's flowers, but they are only \"reflected in mirrors, as images of images\u2014twice removed from reality\". In the scene of Marion's death, Brill describes the transition from the bathroom drain to Marion's lifeless eye, \"Like the eye of the amorphous sea creature at the end of Fellini's ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', it marks the birth of death, an emblem of final hopelessness and corruption.\" <ref name=\"brill234\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=224}}</ref>\n\nMarion is deprived of \"the humble treasures of love, marriage, home and family\", which Hitchcock considers elements of human happiness. There exists among ''Psycho''{{'}}s secondary characters a lack of \"familial warmth and stability\", which demonstrates the unlikelihood of domestic fantasies. The film contains ironic jokes about domesticity, such as when Sam writes a letter to Marion, agreeing to marry her, only after the audience sees her buried in the swamp. Sam and Marion's sister Lila, in investigating Marion's disappearance, develop an \"increasingly connubial\" relationship, a development that Marion is denied.<ref name=\"brill228\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=228}}</ref> Norman also suffers a similarly perverse definition of domesticity. He has \"an infantile and divided personality\" and lives in a mansion whose past occupies the present. Norman displays stuffed birds that are \"frozen in time\" and keeps childhood toys and stuffed animals in his room. He is hostile toward suggestions to move from the past, such as with Marion's suggestion to put\nhis mother \"someplace\" and as a result kills Marion to preserve his past. Brill explains, {{\" '}}Someplace' for Norman is where his delusions of love, home, and family are declared invalid and exposed.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=229}}</ref>\n\nLight and darkness feature prominently in ''Psycho''. The first shot after the [[intertitle]] is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures. Marion is almost immediately cast in darkness; she is preceded by her shadow as she reenters the office to steal money and as she enters her bedroom. When she flees Phoenix, darkness descends on her drive. The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses, and she finally arrives at the Bates Motel in near darkness.<ref name=\"brill225\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=225}}</ref> Bright lights are also \"the ironic equivalent of darkness\" in the film, blinding instead of illuminating. Examples of brightness include the opening window shades in Sam's and Marion's hotel room, vehicle headlights at night, the neon sign at the Bates Motel, \"the glaring white\" of the bathroom tiles where Marion dies, and the fruit cellar's exposed light bulb shining on the corpse of Norman's mother. Such bright lights typically characterize danger and violence in Hitchcock's films.<ref name=\"brill225\u2013256\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|pp=225\u2013226}}</ref>\n\n===Motifs===\nThe film often features shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows are present from the first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out of the window. The stuffed birds' shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Norman's mother is seen in only shadows until the  end. More subtly, [[Backlighting (lighting design)|backlighting]] turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila's head.<ref name=\"Leigh9093\">Leigh, pp. 90\u201393</ref>\n\nMirrors reflect Marion as she packs, her eyes as she checks the rear-view mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour can be seen as a foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.<ref name=\"Leigh9093\"/>\n\nThere are a number of references to birds. Marion's last name is Crane and she is from Phoenix. Norman comments that Marion eats like a bird. The motel room has pictures of birds on the wall. Brigitte Peucker also suggests that Norman's hobby of stuffing birds literalizes the British slang expression for sex, \"stuffing birds\", ''bird'' being British slang for a desirable woman.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Material Image: Art And the Real in Film |last= Peucker |first=Brigitte |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8047-5431-6 |page=167 |url=}}</ref> Robert Allan suggests that Norman's mother is his original \"stuffed bird\", both in the sense of having preserved her body and the incestuous nature of Norman's emotional bond with her.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hitchcock's Romantic Irony |last= Allen |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-231-13575-7 |page=161 |url=}}</ref>\n\n===Psychoanalytic interpretation===\n''Psycho'' has been called \"the first [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] thriller.\"<ref name=\"Kaganski\">{{Harvnb|Kaganski|1997}}</ref> The sex and violence in the film were unlike anything previously seen in a mainstream film. \"The shower scene is both feared and desired,\" wrote French film critic Serge Kaganski. \"Hitchcock may be scaring his female viewers out of their wits, but he is turning his male viewers into potential rapists, since Janet Leigh has been turning men on ever since she appeared in her brassiere in the first scene.\"<ref name=\"Kaganski\"/>\n\nIn his documentary ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]'', [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] remarks that Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the three levels of the human mind that are postulated by [[Freud]]ian [[psychoanalysis]]: the top floor would be the ''[[superego]]'', where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' ''[[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]'', where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' ''[[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]]''. \u017di\u017eek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.<ref>{{cite video |people= [[Sophie Fiennes|Fiennes, Sophie]] (director); [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek|\u017di\u017eek, Slavoj]] (writer/narrator) |date = 2006|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0828154|title = The Pervert's Guide to Cinema|medium= documentary |publisher=Amoeba Film}}</ref>\n\n==Recognition==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

It stars [[Anthony Perkins]], [[Janet Leigh]], [[John Gavin]], [[Vera Miles]], and [[Martin Balsam]], and was based on the [[Psycho (novel)|1959 novel of the same name]] by [[Robert Bloch]]. The film centers on an encounter between a secretary, [[Marion Crane]] (Leigh), who ends up at a secluded motel after stealing money from her employer, and the motel's owner-manager, [[Norman Bates]] (Perkins), and its aftermath.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/24944/Psycho/full-synopsis.html|title=Psycho (1960) - Full Synopsis - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|language=en|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Psycho'' was seen as a departure from Hitchcock's previous film ''[[North by Northwest]]'', having been filmed on a low budget, in black-and-white, and by a television crew. The film initially received mixed reviews, but outstanding [[box office|box-office]] returns prompted critical reevaluation. ''Psycho'' was nominated for four [[33rd Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Leigh and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Hitchcock.\n\n''Psycho'' is now considered one of Hitchcock's best films<ref>''Psycho'' is the top listed Hitchcock film in ''The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time'' by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', and the highest Hitchcock film on [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies]].</ref> and praised as a major work of cinematic art by international film critics and scholars. Often ranked among [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films of all time]], it set a new level of acceptability for violence, deviant behavior and sexuality in American films,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/psycho/|title=''Psycho'' reviews|accessdate=April 17, 2010|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> and is widely considered to be the earliest example of the [[slasher film]] genre.\n\nAfter Hitchcock's death in 1980, [[Universal Studios]] began producing follow-ups: three [[Psycho (franchise)|sequels]], a [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]], a [[Bates Motel (film)|made-for-television spin-off]], and [[Bates Motel (TV series)|a prequel television series]] set in the 2010s. In 1992, the [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a lunchtime tryst in a [[Phoenix, Arizona]] hotel, real-estate secretary [[Marion Crane]] and her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, discuss how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client leaves a $40,000 ({{Inflation|US|40000|1959|r=-3|fmt=eq}})  cash payment on a property. Marion's boss asks her to deposit the money in the bank and allows her to leave work early after she complains of a headache. Once home, she decides to steal the money and drive to Fairvale, California, where Sam lives.\n\nEn route to Fairvale, Marion stops her car on the side of the road and falls asleep. She is awakened the next morning by a state patrol trooper who follows Marion after questioning her and growing suspicious about her skittish behavior. Marion stops at a [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], California automobile dealership and trades in her [[Ford Mainline]], with its Arizona license plates, for a [[Ford Custom]] 300 with California tags. The officer spots Marion at the car dealership and eyes her suspiciously as she abruptly drives away.\n\nDuring a heavy rainstorm, Marion stops for the night at the Bates Motel. The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]], invites her to share a light dinner after she checks in. She accepts his invitation but overhears an argument between Norman and [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] about bringing a woman into their [[Carpenter Gothic|Gothic]] home, which sits perched above the motel. Instead they eat in the motel parlor, where he tells her about his life with his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids him to have a life apart from her.\n\nMoved by Norman's story, Marion decides to drive back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money, which she hides in a folded newspaper on the nightstand. As she showers, a shadowy figure stabs her to death. After seeing blood, Norman panics and runs to Marion's room, where he discovers her body. He cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions \u2013 including (unbeknownst to him) the stolen money \u2013 into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.\n\nA week later, Marion's sister [[Lila Crane|Lila]] arrives in Fairvale and confronts Sam about Marion's whereabouts. Private investigator Milton Arbogast approaches them and confirms that Marion is wanted for stealing the $40,000. Arbogast sleuths local motels and discovers Marion spent a night at the Bates Motel. He questions Norman, whose stammering, skittishness and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicion. After Norman implies that Marion met his mother, Arbogast asks to speak with her, but Norman refuses to allow it. Arbogast updates Sam and Lila about his search for Marion and promises to phone again soon. He goes to the Bates' home in search of Norman's mother; as he reaches the top of the stairs, a mysterious figure stabs him to death.\n\nWhen Lila and Sam do not hear from Arbogast, Sam visits the motel. Sam sees a figure in the house who he assumes is Mrs. Bates, but she ignores his knocking. Lila and Sam visit the local deputy sheriff, who informs them that Mrs. Bates died in a murder-suicide ten years ago. The sheriff concludes that Arbogast lied to Sam and Lila so he could pursue Marion and the money. Convinced that some ill has befallen Arbogast, Lila and Sam drive to the motel. Norman carries his mother from her room and hides her in the fruit cellar.\n\nAt the motel, Sam distracts Norman by engaging in conversation while Lila cases the property and sneaks inside the house. After Sam grills him, Norman becomes agitated, knocks Sam out, and rushes to the house. Lila hides in the cellar, where she finds Mrs. Bates in a chair. Lila turns her around and discovers she is a mummified corpse. Lila screams as Norman runs into the cellar, holding a [[chef's knife]] and wearing his mother's clothes and a wig. Before Norman can attack Lila, Sam \u2013 having regained consciousness \u2013 subdues him.\n\nAt the courthouse, a psychiatrist explains that Norman murdered Mrs. Bates and her lover ten years ago out of jealousy. Unable to bear the guilt, he stole her corpse and began to treat it as if she were still alive. He recreated his mother in his own mind as an [[multiple personality disorder|alternate personality]], dressing in her clothes and talking to himself in her voice. This \"Mother\" personality is as jealous and possessive as Mrs. Bates was while alive: whenever Norman feels attracted to a woman, \"Mother\" kills her. As \"Mother\", Norman killed two young girls before stabbing Marion and Arbogast to death. The psychiatrist says the \"Mother\" personality has taken permanent hold of Norman's mind. While Norman sits in a holding cell, \"Mother\"{{'}}s voice-over protests that the murders were Norman's doing. Marion's car is towed from the swamp.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Norman Bates in \"Psycho\" (1960).jpg|thumb|[[Anthony Perkins]]' performance as [[Norman Bates]] won him considerable critical praise.]]\n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as [[Norman Bates]]\n* [[Janet Leigh]] as [[Marion Crane]]\n* [[Vera Miles]] as [[Lila Crane]]\n* [[John Gavin]] as Sam Loomis\n* [[Martin Balsam]] as Private Investigator Milton Arbogast\n* [[John McIntire]] as Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers\n* [[Simon Oakland]] as Dr. Richmond\n* [[Frank Albertson]] as Tom Cassidy\n* [[Pat Hitchcock]] as Caroline\n* [[Vaughn Taylor (actor)|Vaughn Taylor]] as George Lowery\n* [[Lurene Tuttle]] as Mrs. Chambers\n* [[John Anderson (actor)|John Anderson]] as California Charlie\n* [[Mort Mills]] as Highway Patrol Officer\n* [[Francis De Sales (actor)|Francis De Sales]] as Deputy District Attorney Alan Deats (uncredited)\n* [[George Eldredge]] as Police Chief James Mitchell (uncredited)\n* [[Robert Osborne]] as Police Guard (uncredited)\n* [[Ted Knight]] as Police Guard (uncredited)\n* [[Virginia Gregg]], [[Paul Jasmin]], and [[Jeanette Nolan]] as the voice of [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma \"Mother\" Bates]] (uncredited).

Each had deceased, domineering mothers, had sealed off a room in their home as a shrine to her, and dressed in women's clothes. However, unlike Bates, Gein is not strictly considered a [[serial killer]], having been charged with murder only twice.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref>\n[[File:Psycho House, Motel and car composite.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.59|The ''Psycho'' set on the [[Universal Studios Lot]], featuring a [[Ford Custom 300]] similar to that driven by [[Janet Leigh]] in the film, is now part of the studio tour at the [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] theme park.]]\n[[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's long-time assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the novel in his \"Criminals at Large\" column and decided to show the book to her employer, even though studio readers at [[Paramount Pictures]] had already rejected its premise for a film.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref>  Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> and reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to preserve the novel's surprises.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Hitchcock, who had come to face genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own, was seeking new material to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount, ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. He disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives balked at Hitchcock's proposal and refused to provide his usual budget.<ref name=\"Rebello23\"/> In response, Hitchcock offered to film ''Psycho'' quickly and cheaply in black and white using his ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' television series crew. Paramount executives rejected this cost-conscious approach, claiming their sound stages were booked even though the industry was in a slump. Hitchcock countered he would personally finance the project and film it at Universal-International using his Shamley Productions crew if Paramount would merely distribute. In lieu of his usual $250,000 director's fee he proposed a 60% stake in the film negative. This combined offer was accepted and Hitchcock went ahead in spite of naysaying from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\n===Novel adaptation===\nJames P.

Stefano found the character of Norman Bates\u2014who, in the book, is middle-aged, overweight, and more overtly unstable\u2014unsympathetic, but became more intrigued when Hitchcock suggested casting Anthony Perkins.<ref name=\"leigh3637\"/> Stefano eliminated Bates' drinking,<ref name=\"Rebello 1990 39\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=39}}</ref> which evidently necessitated removing Bates' \"becoming\" the Mother personality when in a drunken stupor. Also gone is Bates' interest in [[spiritualism]], the [[occult]] and [[pornography]].<ref>Tangentially mentioned by interviewer of Stefano [http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/wiki/Creative_Screenwriting_-_Interview_with_Joseph_Stefano Joseph Stefano] but generally given less attention than the film's omission of Bates' alcoholism and pornography.</ref> Hitchcock and Stefano elected to open the film with scenes in Marion's life and not introduce Bates at all until 20 minutes into the film, rather than open with Bates reading a history book as Bloch does.<ref name=\"Rebello 1990 39\"/> Indeed, writer Joseph W. Smith notes that, \"Her story occupies only two of the novel's 17 chapters. Hitchcock and Stefano expanded this to nearly half the narrative\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|2009|p=15}}</ref> He likewise notes there is no hotel tryst between Marion and Sam in the novel. For Stefano, the conversation between Marion and Norman in the hotel parlor in which she displays a maternal sympathy towards him makes it possible for the audience to switch their sympathies towards Norman Bates after Marion's murder.<ref name=\"screenwriting-stefano\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/wiki/Creative_Screenwriting_-_Interview_with_Joseph_Stefano |title=Interview in Creative ScreenWriting Journal.

Stefano wanted to give the audience \"indications that something was quite wrong, but it could not be spelled out or overdone.\"<ref name=\"screenwriting-stefano\"/> In his book of interviews with Hitchcock, [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] notes that the novel \"cheats\" by having extended conversations between Norman and \"Mother\" and stating what Mother is \"doing\" at various given moments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Truffaut|1967|p=268}}</ref>\n\nThe first name of the female protagonist was changed from Mary to Marion, since a real Mary Crane existed in Phoenix.<ref name=\"leigh3334\">Leigh, pp. 33\u201334</ref> Also changed is the novel's budding romance between Sam and Lila. Hitchcock preferred to focus the audience's attention on the solution to the mystery,<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|2009|p=16}}</ref> and Stefano thought such a relationship would make Sam Loomis seem cheap.<ref name=\"screenwriting-stefano\"/> Instead of having Sam explain Norman's [[psychopathology|pathology]] to Lila, the film uses a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Leigh, 39\">Leigh, p. 39</ref> (Stefano was in therapy dealing with his relationship with his own mother while writing the script.)<ref>{{Harvnb|Caminer|Gallagher|1996}}</ref> The novel is more violent than the film; for instance, Marion is beheaded in the shower as opposed to being stabbed to death.<ref name=\"dvddoc\"/> Minor changes include changing Marion's telltale earring found after her death to a scrap of paper that failed to flush down the toilet. This provided some shock effect, since toilets were virtually never seen in American cinema in the 1960s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=47}}</ref> The location of Arbogast's death was moved from the foyer to the stairwell. Stefano thought this would make it easier to conceal the truth about \"Mother\" without tipping that something was being hidden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/wiki/Creative_Screenwriting_-_Interview_with_Joseph_Stefano |title=Interview with Stefano |publisher=Hitchcockwiki.com |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}</ref> As Janet Leigh put it, this gave Hitchcock more options for his camera.<ref name=\"Leigh, 39\"/>\n\n===Pre-production===\nParamount, whose contract guaranteed another film by Hitchcock, did not want Hitchcock to make ''Psycho''. Paramount was expecting ''[[List of unproduced Hitchcock projects#No Bail for the Judge (1958\u20131961)|No Bail for the Judge]]'' starring [[Audrey Hepburn]], who became pregnant and had to bow out, leading Hitchcock to scrap the production.

Green]] to Phoenix to scout locations and shoot the opening scene. The shot was supposed to be an aerial shot of Phoenix that slowly zoomed into the hotel window of a passionate Marion and Sam. Ultimately, the helicopter footage proved too shaky and had to be spliced with footage from the studio.<ref name=\"leigh2426\">Leigh, pp. 24\u201326</ref> Another crew filmed day and night footage on Highway 99 between [[Gorman, California|Gorman]] and [[Fresno]], California for projection when Marion drives from Phoenix. Footage of her driving into Bakersfield to trade her car is also shown. They also provided the location shots for the scene in which she is discovered sleeping in her car by the highway patrolman.<ref name=\"leigh2426\"/> In one street scene shot in downtown Phoenix, Christmas decorations were discovered to be visible; rather than re-shoot the footage, Hitchcock chose to add a graphic to the opening scene marking the date as \"Friday, December the Eleventh\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=90}}</ref>\n\nGreen also took photos of a prepared list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio. These included many real estate offices and homes such as those belonging to Marion and her sister.<ref name=\"leigh2426\"/> He also found a girl who looked just like he imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor.<ref name=\"leigh2426\"/> The look of the Bates house was modeled on [[Edward Hopper]]'s painting ''The House by the Railroad,''<ref>{{Harvnb|Wagstaff|2004|p=234}} See also Liner notes to CD recording of score by Joel McNeely & Royal Scottish National Orchestra</ref> a fanciful portrait of the [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] home at 18 Conger Avenue in [[Haverstraw, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/96may/hopper/hopper.htm |title=''Someplace Like Home: An eerily familiar house rises in many American landscapes'' by Paul Bochner.

Leigh took the joke well, and she wondered whether it was done to keep her on edge and thus more in character or to judge which corpse would be scarier for the audience.<ref>Leigh, pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\nDuring shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which \"Mother\" is discovered required a complicated coordinating of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila Crane)  hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitchcock, a series of shots with Arbogast going up the stairs in the Bates house before he is stabbed were helmed by assistant director Hilton A. Green, working with storyboard artist Saul Bass' drawings only while Hitchcock was incapacitated with the common cold. However, upon viewing the [[dailies]] of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them. He claimed they were \"no good\" because they did not portray \"an innocent person but a sinister man who was going up those stairs\".<ref name=\"Truffaut\">{{Harvnb|Truffaut|1967|p=273}}</ref> Hitchcock later re-shot the scene, though a little of the cut footage made its way into the film. Filming the murder of Arbogast proved problematic owing to the overhead camera angle necessary to hide the film's twist. A camera track constructed on pulleys alongside the stairway together with a chairlike device had to be constructed and thoroughly tested over a period of weeks.<ref>Leigh, pp. 85\u201386</ref>\n\n[[List of Hitchcock cameo appearances|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo]] is a signature occurrence in most of his films.

When interviewing Hitchcock in 1967, [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] asked about the extent of Bass' contribution, to which Hitchcock replied that in addition to the titles, Bass had provided storyboards for the Arbogast murder (which he claimed to have rejected), but made no mention of Bass providing storyboards for the shower scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://notcoming.com/saulbass/caps_psycho.php|title=Psycho: The Title Credits|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> According to Bill Krohn's ''Hitchcock At Work'', Bass' first claim to have directed the scene was in 1970, when he provided a magazine with 48 drawings used as storyboards as proof of his contribution.<ref name=\"Krohn\">{{Harvnb|Krohn|2003}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\nKrohn's analysis of the production of ''Psycho'' in his book ''Hitchcock at Work'', while refuting Bass' claims for directing the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene\u2014most notably, the fact that the killer appears as a silhouette, and details such as the close-ups of the slashing knife, Leigh's desperate outstretched arm, the shower curtain being torn off its hooks, and the transition from the hole of the drainage pipe to Marion Crane's dead eyes. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.<ref name=\"Krohn\"/>\n\nKrohn's research also notes that Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a [[Mitchell Camera|BNC Mitchell]], the other a handheld French ''[[Eclair (camera)|\u00c9clair]]'' camera which [[Orson Welles]] had used in ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958). In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a [[Moviola]] on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor [[George Tomasini]] worked on with Hitchcock's advice, however did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass' storyboards.<ref name=\"Krohn\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Donald Spoto]] in ''The Dark Side of Genius'', Hitchcock's wife, [[Alma Reville]], spotted a blooper in one of the last screenings of ''Psycho'' before its official release: after Marion was supposedly dead, one could see her blink. According to [[Patricia Hitchcock]], talking in Laurent Bouzereau's \"making of\" documentary, Alma spotted that Leigh's character appeared to take a breath. In either case, the postmortem activity was edited out and was never seen by audiences.<ref name=\"dvddoc\"/> Although Marion's eyes should be dilated after her death, the contact lenses necessary for this effect would have required six weeks of acclimation to wear them, so Hitchcock decided to forgo them.<ref>Leigh, pp. 176, 42</ref>\n\nIt is often claimed that, despite its graphic nature, the shower scene never once shows a knife puncturing flesh.<ref>Leigh, p. 169</ref><ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=December 6, 1998 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=December 1, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Harmetz, Aljean |title=Janet Leigh, 77, Shower Taker of 'Psycho,' Is Dead |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 5, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/05/movies/05leigh.html?ex=1254715200&en=596717cddaea56ef&ei=5090 |accessdate=December 1, 2006 |authorlink=Aljean Harmetz}}</ref> However, a frame by frame analysis of the sequence shows one shot in which the knife appears to penetrate Leigh's abdomen, but the effect may have been created by lighting and reverse motion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/blog/?p=274 |title=8 frames of \"Psycho\" |date=May 8, 2008 |work=hitchcockwiki.com |accessdate=April 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409193048/http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/blog/?p=274 |archivedate=April 9, 2010 }}</ref> Leigh herself was so affected by this scene when she saw it, that she no longer took showers unless she absolutely had to; she would lock all the doors and windows and would leave the bathroom and shower door open.<ref>Leigh, p. 131</ref> She never realized until she first watched the film \"how vulnerable and defenseless one is\".<ref name=\"dvddoc\"/>\n\nLeigh and Hitchcock fully discussed what the scene meant:\n{{Quote\n|text=Marion had decided to go back to Phoenix, come clean, and take the consequence, so when she stepped into the bathtub it was as if she were stepping into the baptismal waters.

The viewer is unaware of the [[gender dysphoria]] until, at the end of the movie, it is revealed that Bates is a [[crossdresser]] in the [[attempted murder]] of Lila. At the station, Sam asks why Bates was dressed that way. The police officer, ignorant of Bates' split personality, bluntly utters that Bates is a [[transvestite]]. The psychiatrist corrects him and says, \"Not exactly\".

Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, and those who had not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in.<ref name=\"Leigh112\">Leigh, p. 112</ref> The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set.

In Britain, the [[BBFC]] requested cuts to stabbing sounds and visible nude shots, and in New Zealand the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands was objected to. In Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast, and a shot of Norman's mother's corpse were removed.<ref name=\"leigh105106\">Leigh, pp. 105\u20136</ref>\n\nThe most controversial move was Hitchcock's \"no late admission\" policy for the film, which was unusual for the time. It was not entirely original as [[Henri-Georges Clouzot|Clouzot]] had done the same in France for ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Diabolique]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=21}}</ref> Hitchcock thought that if people entered the theater late and never saw the star actress Janet Leigh, they would feel cheated.<ref name=\"Leigh9697\" /> At first theater owners opposed the idea, claiming that they would lose business.

It is \"tracked\" with Herrmann's ''Psycho'' theme, but also jovial music from Hitchcock's comedy ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]''; most of Hitchcock's dialogue is post-synchronized. The trailer was made after completion of the film, and since Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had [[Vera Miles]] don a blonde wig and scream loudly as he pulled the shower curtain back in the bathroom sequence of the preview. Since the title, \"''Psycho''\", instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years. However, a freeze-frame analysis clearly reveals that it is Miles and not Leigh in the shower during the trailer.<ref name=\"Leigh9697\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe film was so successful that it was reissued to theaters in 1965. \n[[File:Psycho 1960 Lobby Card.jpg|thumb|<center>Lobby card for a 1969 reissue.</center>]]\nA year later, [[CBS]] purchased the television rights for $450,000.

This, along with box office numbers, led to a reconsideration of the film by critics, and it eventually received a large amount of praise. It broke box-office records in Japan and the rest of Asia, France, Britain, South America, the United States, and Canada, and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period.<ref name=\"leigh99102\"/> It was the most profitable black-and-white sound film ever made,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and Hitchcock personally realized well in excess of $15 million. He then swapped his rights to ''Psycho'' and his TV anthology for 150,000 shares of [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], making him the third largest shareholder in MCA Inc., and his own boss at Universal, in theory; however, this did not stop them from interfering with his later films.<ref>Stephen Rebello, ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, Soft Skull Press, Berkeley, 1990.</ref><ref>Leigh, p. 141</ref> ''Psycho'' was, by a large margin, the most profitable film of Hitchcock's career, earning over $32 million for the studio on release, and $18 million by the end of the year. Around the time of the run's end, the film had grossed $50 million in domestic theaters.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film shattered attendance records at the [[London]] Plaza [[Movie theatre|Cinema]], but nearly all British critics gave it poor reviews, questioning Hitchcock's taste and judgment. Reasons cited for this were the critics' late screenings, forcing them to rush their reviews, their dislike of the gimmicky promotion, and Hitchcock's [[expatriate]] status.<ref name=\"leigh103106\">Leigh, pp. 103\u2013106</ref> Perhaps thanks to the public's response and Hitchcock's efforts at promoting it, the critics did a re-review, and the film was praised.

The film is instead ironic as it presents \"clarity and fulfillment\" of romance. The past is central to the film; the main characters \"struggle to understand and resolve destructive personal histories\" and ultimately fail.<ref name=\"brill200\u2013201\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|pp=200\u2013201}}</ref> Lesley Brill writes, \"The inexorable forces of past sins and mistakes crush hopes for regeneration and present happiness.\" The crushed hope is highlighted by the death of the protagonist, Marion Crane, halfway through the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=223}}</ref> Marion is like [[Persephone]] of [[Greek mythology]], who is abducted temporarily from the world of the living. The myth does not sustain with Marion, who dies hopelessly in her room at the Bates Motel. The room is wallpapered with floral print like Persephone's flowers, but they are only \"reflected in mirrors, as images of images\u2014twice removed from reality\". In the scene of Marion's death, Brill describes the transition from the bathroom drain to Marion's lifeless eye, \"Like the eye of the amorphous sea creature at the end of Fellini's ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', it marks the birth of death, an emblem of final hopelessness and corruption.\" <ref name=\"brill234\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=224}}</ref>\n\nMarion is deprived of \"the humble treasures of love, marriage, home and family\", which Hitchcock considers elements of human happiness. There exists among ''Psycho''{{'}}s secondary characters a lack of \"familial warmth and stability\", which demonstrates the unlikelihood of domestic fantasies. The film contains ironic jokes about domesticity, such as when Sam writes a letter to Marion, agreeing to marry her, only after the audience sees her buried in the swamp. Sam and Marion's sister Lila, in investigating Marion's disappearance, develop an \"increasingly connubial\" relationship, a development that Marion is denied.<ref name=\"brill228\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=228}}</ref> Norman also suffers a similarly perverse definition of domesticity. He has \"an infantile and divided personality\" and lives in a mansion whose past occupies the present. Norman displays stuffed birds that are \"frozen in time\" and keeps childhood toys and stuffed animals in his room. He is hostile toward suggestions to move from the past, such as with Marion's suggestion to put\nhis mother \"someplace\" and as a result kills Marion to preserve his past. Brill explains, {{\" '}}Someplace' for Norman is where his delusions of love, home, and family are declared invalid and exposed.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=229}}</ref>\n\nLight and darkness feature prominently in ''Psycho''. The first shot after the [[intertitle]] is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures. Marion is almost immediately cast in darkness; she is preceded by her shadow as she reenters the office to steal money and as she enters her bedroom. When she flees Phoenix, darkness descends on her drive. The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses, and she finally arrives at the Bates Motel in near darkness.<ref name=\"brill225\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=225}}</ref> Bright lights are also \"the ironic equivalent of darkness\" in the film, blinding instead of illuminating. Examples of brightness include the opening window shades in Sam's and Marion's hotel room, vehicle headlights at night, the neon sign at the Bates Motel, \"the glaring white\" of the bathroom tiles where Marion dies, and the fruit cellar's exposed light bulb shining on the corpse of Norman's mother. Such bright lights typically characterize danger and violence in Hitchcock's films.<ref name=\"brill225\u2013256\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|pp=225\u2013226}}</ref>\n\n===Motifs===\nThe film often features shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows are present from the first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out of the window. The stuffed birds' shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Norman's mother is seen in only shadows until the  end. More subtly, [[Backlighting (lighting design)|backlighting]] turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila's head.<ref name=\"Leigh9093\">Leigh, pp. 90\u201393</ref>\n\nMirrors reflect Marion as she packs, her eyes as she checks the rear-view mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour can be seen as a foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.<ref name=\"Leigh9093\"/>\n\nThere are a number of references to birds. Marion's last name is Crane and she is from Phoenix. Norman comments that Marion eats like a bird. The motel room has pictures of birds on the wall. Brigitte Peucker also suggests that Norman's hobby of stuffing birds literalizes the British slang expression for sex, \"stuffing birds\", ''bird'' being British slang for a desirable woman.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Material Image: Art And the Real in Film |last= Peucker |first=Brigitte |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8047-5431-6 |page=167 |url=}}</ref> Robert Allan suggests that Norman's mother is his original \"stuffed bird\", both in the sense of having preserved her body and the incestuous nature of Norman's emotional bond with her.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hitchcock's Romantic Irony |last= Allen |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-231-13575-7 |page=161 |url=}}</ref>\n\n===Psychoanalytic interpretation===\n''Psycho'' has been called \"the first [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] thriller.\"<ref name=\"Kaganski\">{{Harvnb|Kaganski|1997}}</ref> The sex and violence in the film were unlike anything previously seen in a mainstream film. \"The shower scene is both feared and desired,\" wrote French film critic Serge Kaganski. \"Hitchcock may be scaring his female viewers out of their wits, but he is turning his male viewers into potential rapists, since Janet Leigh has been turning men on ever since she appeared in her brassiere in the first scene.\"<ref name=\"Kaganski\"/>\n\nIn his documentary ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]'', [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] remarks that Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the three levels of the human mind that are postulated by [[Freud]]ian [[psychoanalysis]]: the top floor would be the ''[[superego]]'', where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' ''[[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]'', where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' ''[[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]]''. \u017di\u017eek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.<ref>{{cite video |people= [[Sophie Fiennes|Fiennes, Sophie]] (director); [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek|\u017di\u017eek, Slavoj]] (writer/narrator) |date = 2006|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0828154|title = The Pervert's Guide to Cinema|medium= documentary |publisher=Amoeba Film}}</ref>\n\n==Recognition==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!
