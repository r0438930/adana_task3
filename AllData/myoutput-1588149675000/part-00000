It is located in the [[Mid-West Region, Ireland|Mid-West Region]] and is also part of the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]]. With a population of 94,192 at the 2016 census, including Mark O\u2019Toole and his wee better looking dog, Teddy O\u2019Toole. <ref name=cso2016/> Limerick is the [[List of towns in the Republic of Ireland by population|third-most populous]] urban area in the state, and the [[List of settlements on the island of Ireland by population|fourth-most populous]] city on the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]]. The city lies on the [[River Shannon]], with the historic core of the city located on [[King's Island, Limerick|King's Island]], which is bounded by the Shannon and [[Abbey River, Limerick|Abbey]] Rivers. Limerick is also located at the head of the [[Shannon Estuary]], where the river widens before it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. [[Limerick City and County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] for the city.\n\n==Geography and political subdivisions==\nAt the 2016 census, the Metropolitan District of Limerick had a population of 104,952.<ref name=\"Municipal District Limerick\">{{cite web|title=Census 2016 Municipal District Limerick|url=http://census.cso.ie/sapmap2016/Results.aspx?Geog_Type=MD2014&Geog_Code=C87338E0-A7B9-4305-B7F2-FC23410FEFE2|access-date=22 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005050929/http://census.cso.ie/sapmap2016/Results.aspx?Geog_Type=MD2014&Geog_Code=C87338E0-A7B9-4305-B7F2-FC23410FEFE2|archive-date=5 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 1 June 2014 following the merger of Limerick City and County Council, a new Metropolitan District of Limerick was formed within the united council, which extended the city area.

It is located at a strategic position on the River Shannon with four main crossing points near the city centre. To the south of the city is the [[Golden Vale]], an area of rich [[pastureland]]. Historically, much of the city's industry was based on this rich agricultural hinterland, and it is particularly noted for [[Limerick ham]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Limerick}}\n[[File:Limerick-King-Johns-Castle-2012.JPG|thumb|left|[[King John's Castle (Limerick)|King John's Castle]] on the [[River Shannon]]]]\n\n===Ancient and medieval history===\n''Luimneach'' originally referred to the general area along the banks of the [[Shannon Estuary]] known as ''Loch Luimnigh''. The earliest settlement in the city, ''Inis Sibhtonn'', was the original name for King's Island during the pre-Viking and Viking eras. This island was also called ''Inis an Ghaill Duibh'', \"The Dark-(haired) Foreigner's Island\". The name is recorded in [[Viking]] sources as ''Hlymrekr''.\n\nThe city dates from 812 which is the earliest probable settlement; however, history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area surrounding King's Island, the island at the historical city centre. Antiquity's map-maker, Ptolemy, produced in 150 the earliest map of Ireland, showing a place called \"Regia\" at the same site as King's Island. History also records an important battle involving Cormac mac Airt in 221 and a visit by St. Patrick in 434 to baptise an E\u00f3ganachta king, Carthann the Fair. Saint Munchin, the first bishop of Limerick died in 652, indicating the city was a place of some note. In 812 the Vikings sailed up the Shannon and pillaged the city, burned the monastery of Mungret but were forced to flee when the Irish attacked and killed many of their number.{{fact|date=December 2019}} The Normans redesigned the city in the 12th century and added much of the most notable architecture, such as [[King John's Castle (Limerick)|King John's Castle]] and [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Limerick|St Mary's Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hodkinson|first=Brian|year=2002|title=The Topography of Pre-Norman Limerick|journal=North Munster Antiquarian Journal|volume=42|pages=1\u20136}}</ref>\n\nIn early medieval times Limerick was at the centre of the [[Kingdom of Thomond]] which corresponds to the present day County Clare, the Kingdom also included North Kerry and parts of South Offaly. One of the kingdom's most notable kings was [[Brian Boru]], ancestor of the O'Brien Clan of Dalcassians. The word Thomond is synonymous with the region and is retained in place names such as Thomondgate, Thomond Bridge and [[Thomond Park]].\n\n===Late Renaissance/Early modern history===\n[[File:DV405 no.235 Limerick.png|thumb|Limerick, painted in 1830]]\n[[File:George Street, Limerick (5691906290).jpg|thumb|Cannock's Department Store on O'Connell Street in the early 20th Century]]\n\nLimerick in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was often called the most beautiful city in Ireland.{{Attribution needed|date=September 2019}} The English-born judge [[Luke Gernon]], a resident of Limerick, wrote in 1620 that at his first sight of the city he had been amazed at its magnificence: \"lofty buildings of marble, like the Colleges in [[Oxford]]\".<ref>Gernon, Luke  ''A Discourse of Ireland'' 1620 edited by C.L. Falkiner 1904</ref>\n\nDuring the civil wars of the 17th century the city played a pivotal role, besieged by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1651 and twice by [[William III of England|the Williamites]] in the 1690s. The [[Treaty of Limerick]] ended the [[Williamite war in Ireland]] which was fought between supporters of the Catholic [[King James II]] (Jacobites) and the Protestant [[William III of England|King William of Orange]] (Williamites). The treaty offered toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]]. The Treaty was of national significance as it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. The articles of the Treaty protecting Catholic rights were not passed by the Protestant [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] which rather updated the [[Penal Laws]] against Catholics which had major implications for [[History of Ireland|Irish history]]. Reputedly the Treaty was signed on the Treaty Stone, an irregular block of limestone which once served as a mounting block for horses. This stone is now displayed on a pedestal at Clancy Strand. Because of the treaty, Limerick is sometimes known as the Treaty City. This turbulent period earned the city its motto: ''urbs antiqua fuit studisque asperrima belli'' (an ancient city well studied in the arts of war).\n\nThe peaceful times that followed the turmoil of the late 17th century allowed the city to prosper through trade in the late 18th century. During this time Limerick Port established itself as one of Ireland's major commercial ports exporting agricultural produce from one of Ireland's most fertile areas, the [[Golden Vale]], to Britain and America.<ref name=\"libraryireland.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryireland.com/topog/L/Limerick-Port.php|title=Limerick Port|publisher=libraryireland.com}}</ref> This increase in trade and wealth, particularly amongst the city's merchant classes saw a rapid expansion of the city as [[Newtown Pery, Limerick|Georgian Limerick]] began to take shape. This gave the city its present-day look including the extensive terraced streets of [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] townhouses which remain in the city centre today. The [[Waterford and Limerick Railway]] linked the city to the [[Dublin\u2013Cork railway line]] in 1848 and to [[Waterford]] in 1853. The opening of a number of secondary railways in the subsequent decades developed Limerick as a regional centre of communications.  However, the economic downturn in the European conflicts of the [[French Revolution]] and Napoleonic eras, and following the [[Act of Union 1800]], and the impact of the [[Great Irish Famine]] of 1848 caused much of the 19th century to be a more troubled period.\n\n===20th-century history===\n[[File:Limerick arms.jpg|thumb|City arms on a [[manhole cover]]]]\nThe [[Limerick boycott]] was an economic boycott waged against the small Jewish community for over two years in the first decade of the 20th century. It was accompanied by a number of assaults, stone throwing and intimidation, which caused many Jews to leave the city. It was instigated in 1904 by a Redemptorist priest, Father [[John Creagh]].\n\nDuring the [[Irish War of Independence]], the [[Limerick Soviet]] was a self-declared soviet that existed from 15 to 27 April 1919. A general strike was organised by the Limerick Trades and Labour Council, as a protest against the [[British Army]]'s declaration of a \"Special Military Area\" under the Defence of the Realm Act, which covered most of Limerick city and a part of the county. During the strike a special strike committee was set up to print their own money, control food prices and publish newspapers.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, Limerick was characterised by economic stagnation and decline as many traditional industries closed or left the city. However, there were some success stories. In 1942 [[Shannon Airport]] (located in County Clare, 20&nbsp;km west of the city) opened for the first time offering transatlantic flights. In 1959, Shannon Airport enabled the opening of the [[Shannon Free Zone]] which attracted a large number of multinational companies to the region. A long campaign for a third level educational institute to be located in the city finally bore fruit with the establishment of [[National Institute for Higher Education|NIHE Limerick]] in 1969 which eventually became the [[University of Limerick]] in 1989.\n\n==Government and politics==\n[[File:OConnell.JPG|thumb|left|[[O'Connell Street, Limerick]]]]\n{{Historical populations\n|state=collapsed\n|1659|3105\n|1821|59045\n|1831|66554\n|1841|48391\n|1851|48785\n|1861|43924\n|1871|39353\n|1881|38562\n|1891|37155\n|1901|38151\n|1911|38518\n|1926|39448\n|1936|41061\n|1946|42970\n|1951|50820\n|1956|51666\n|1961|51732\n|1966|58082\n|1971|57161\n|1979|60665\n|1981|60736\n|1986|56279\n|1991|52083\n|1996|52039\n|2002|54023\n|2006|59790\n|2011|56779\n||footnote=<ref>For 1653 and 1659 figures from Civil Survey Census of those years, Paper of Mr Hardinge to Royal Irish Academy 14 March 1865.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/census |title=Census for post 1821 figures |publisher=Cso.ie |accessdate=12 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309005718/http://www.cso.ie/census/ |archivedate=9 March 2005 }}</ref>{{Where|date=July 2011}}{{Specify|date=May 2011}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.histpop.org |title=Histpop.org |publisher=Histpop.org |date=2 April 2007 |accessdate=12 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507023856/http://www.histpop.org/ |archivedate=7 May 2016 }}</ref>{{Where|date=July 2011}}{{Specify|date=May 2011}}<ref>{{cite web|author=NISRA |url=http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census |title=Nisra.gov.uk |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=12 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217095720/http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census |archivedate=17 February 2012 }}</ref>{{Where|date=July 2011}}{{Specify|date=May 2011}}<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Lee\n|first=JJ\n|editor-last=Goldstrom\n|editor-first=J.

The Council has responsibility for local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing in the city. The council comprises elected [[Ward (politics)|ward]] [[Councillors]] with an appointed full-time CEO as the city (and county) manager. Local elections are held every five years and the Councillors annually elect a Cathaoirleach or chairman to chair the council. As of 2015, the Cathaoirleach was Cllr Liam Galvin from the Newcastle West electoral area.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/local-news/cllr-liam-galvin-elected-mayor-of-limerick-city-and-county-council-1-6820444|title=Cllr Liam Galvin elected Mayor of Limerick City and County Council|work=limerickleader.ie}}</ref> The 21 Councillors from the 3 electoral districts in the City Metropolitan Area also elect a mayor to represent the city. The Mayoral position is largely ceremonial and has much reduced responsibility following the merger of the Limerick local authorities.

The council was one of the oldest in Ireland and was only exceeded in age by [[Dublin City Council]]. In October 2012 the Government of Ireland published Putting People First- Action Programme for Effective Local Government which set out Government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local government in Ireland. Among the recommendations was the merging of Limerick City Council with [[Limerick County Council]]. The changes came into effect on 1 June 2014 following the implementation of the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html|title=Local authorities|work=citizensinformation.ie}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s onwards the city had outgrown its boundary considerably; the city boundary was only altered slightly and never reflected the overall urban area of the city. A limited boundary extension on the city's north side in 2008 enlarged the city boundary by 1,020 hectares increasing the city's area by almost 50% and raising the population by an estimated 7,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickcitydb.ie/CDBInfo/Strategy/documents/Strat%20for%20Eco%20Irish.pdf |title=Limerick City Development Board \u2013 Strategy for Economic and Social Development |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118205144/http://www.limerickcitydb.ie/CDBInfo/Strategy/documents/Strat%20for%20Eco%20Irish.pdf |archivedate=18 November 2007 }}</ref> The previous boundary, encompassing 2,086 hectares, was delineated in 1950. Newer suburban districts such as [[Dooradoyle]], [[Castletroy]] \u2013 including the [[University of Limerick|University]], Gouldavoher, and [[Raheen, County Limerick|Raheen]] were continually administered to by [[Limerick County Council]] until the merger of the two authorities in June 2014. This local government structure in Limerick caused a number of inefficiencies, most notably in the area of planning. A number of suburbs such as Westbury and [[Parteen]] to the north of the city are governed by [[Clare County Council]].\n\nFollowing the merger of the two authorities in 2014 a new Metropolitan District of Limerick City was set up that included the city urban area and also settlements close to the city such as [[Patrickswell]] and [[Castleconnell]].

From 2011, the constituency boundaries changed in accordance with the proposals of the [[Constituency Commission]] and the subsequent [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009]]. This changed the electoral boundaries from [[Limerick East]] and [[Limerick West]] to [[Limerick City (D\u00e1il constituency)|Limerick City]] and [[Limerick (D\u00e1il constituency)|Limerick]]. Limerick city encompasses the city, the suburban areas of [[Castletroy]] and as far east as [[Castleconnell]]. It also includes part of south [[County Clare]]. The [[Limerick (D\u00e1il constituency)|Limerick]] county constituency takes in most of the rest of the county. For [[European parliament]] elections Limerick is in [[South Ireland (European Parliament constituency)|South Ireland]].\n\n==Climate==\nLimerick's climate is classified as [[Oceanic climate|temperate oceanic]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfb''). Met \u00c9ireann maintains a climatological weather station at [[Shannon Airport]], 20 kilometres west of the city in [[County Clare]]. Shannon Airport records an average of 977 millimetres of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. Limerick has a mild climate, with the average daily maximum in July of {{convert|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and the average daily minimum in January of {{convert|3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. The highest temperature recorded was {{convert|32.0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in June 2018, and the lowest {{convert|-11.4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in 2010. Limerick is the cloudiest city in the state, averaging only 1,295 sunshine hours annually, 3.5 hours of sunshine every day. There are on average 62 days of no recordable sunshine, 6 days of thunder, 22 days of hail and 11 days of snow per year. Shannon Airport is located by the ocean at an elevation of 14 metres, so snow is less common at the station than in the city itself.\n\n{{Weather box <!--Infobox begins-->\n|collapsed               = <!--Any entry in this line will make the template initially collapsed.

The museum was established to house a collection of approximately 2000 works of art and antiquities formed by [[John Hunt (antiquarian)|John and Gertrude Hunt]] during their lifetimes.\n\nThe main park in Limerick is the [[People's Park (Limerick)|People's Park]] which was opened in 1877 in memory of Richard Russell, a prominent local business man. The park is dominated by the Thomas Spring Rice memorial (MP for the city 1820\u20131832) and has a large collection of mature [[deciduous]] and evergreen trees.\n\nLimerick city centre changed significantly with the construction of several modern high-rise buildings in the early 2000s, in particular as part of the regeneration of the former docks area along the Dock Road. The suburban areas, where the majority of the population now live, have grown out from the centre along the main roads to Ennis (North Circular and Ennis Road areas/[[Caherdavin]]), Dublin ([[Castletroy]] and the University) and Cork (Ballinacurra/Dooradoyle/Raheen). Suburban houses are generally two-floor semi-detached homes for single families. These were built from the 1950s onwards in large estates by government projects and commercial developments, although there are many examples of Edwardian and older 1930s suburban homes on the main suburban thoroughfares leading towards the city (North & South Circular, Ballinacurra Road, O'Connell Avenue).\n\n[[File:O'Connell Monument to Daniel O'Connell at O'Connell Avenue, Limerick City.jpg|thumb|left|O'Connell Monument to Daniel O'Connell at The Crescent]]\n\nLimerick city's nightlife is supported by a number of nightclubs and pubs which offer music.

Limerick Chamber of Commerce, a representative body for businesses in the region, celebrated its bicentennial/bicentenary in 2015.\n\nHistorically Limerick was an agricultural commodity-driven economy, due to its position as the first major port along the River Shannon.

Vikings established the city as a maritime trading port. The city's position on a major Irish river system, the [[River Shannon|Shannon]], enabled transport to the midlands of Ireland and further north and west. By the 18th century with the opening of canal systems throughout Ireland, Limerick Port established itself as Ireland's premier commercial port on the western side of the country. This was enabled by ease of access from the facilitated by the opening of canals but most importantly to the River Shannon. The opening of the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]] in the 18th century provided further access to Dublin and the east of the country. There are also a number of disused canals in the vicinity of the city including the Park Canal & the Passey \u2013 Errina Canal on the old Limerick navigation. Waterway transport on the Shannon was regularly used to transport goods from Limerick to Dublin and vice versa however this mode of transport fell into decline in the 20th century. Originally Limerick port was located near the confluence of the Abbey and Shannon rivers at [[King's Island, Limerick|King's Island]]. Today the [[Shannon Foynes Port]] is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road. This general purpose facility portis operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company who operate all marine activities in the Shannon estuary.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Education==\n[[File:University of Limerick Plassey House.jpeg|thumb|Plassey House at the [[University of Limerick]].]]\n[[File:LITPanorama.JPG|thumb|[[Limerick Institute of Technology]]]]\nLimerick is an centre of higher education in the region, and technical and continuation education within the city traces its beginning back to the formation of the [[Limerick Athenaeum]] Society in 1852, marking the foundation of the [[Limerick Institute of Technology]].

With a population of 94,192 at the 2016 census,<ref name=cso2016/> Limerick is the [[List of towns in the Republic of Ireland by population|third-most populous]] urban area in the state, and the [[List of settlements on the island of Ireland by population|fourth-most populous]] city on the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]]. The city lies on the [[River Shannon]], with the historic core of the city located on [[King's Island, Limerick|King's Island]], which is bounded by the Shannon and [[Abbey River, Limerick|Abbey]] Rivers. Limerick is also located at the head of the [[Shannon Estuary]], where the river widens before it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. [[Limerick City and County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] for the city.\n\n==Geography and political subdivisions==\nAt the 2016 census, the Metropolitan District of Limerick had a population of 104,952.<ref name=\"Municipal District Limerick\">{{cite web|title=Census 2016 Municipal District Limerick|url=http://census.cso.ie/sapmap2016/Results.aspx?Geog_Type=MD2014&Geog_Code=C87338E0-A7B9-4305-B7F2-FC23410FEFE2|access-date=22 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005050929/http://census.cso.ie/sapmap2016/Results.aspx?Geog_Type=MD2014&Geog_Code=C87338E0-A7B9-4305-B7F2-FC23410FEFE2|archive-date=5 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 1 June 2014 following the merger of Limerick City and County Council, a new Metropolitan District of Limerick was formed within the united council, which extended the city area.

It is located at a strategic position on the River Shannon with four main crossing points near the city centre. To the south of the city is the [[Golden Vale]], an area of rich [[pastureland]]. Historically, much of the city's industry was based on this rich agricultural hinterland, and it is particularly noted for [[Limerick ham]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Limerick}}\n[[File:Limerick-King-Johns-Castle-2012.JPG|thumb|left|[[King John's Castle (Limerick)|King John's Castle]] on the [[River Shannon]]]]\n\n===Ancient and medieval history===\n''Luimneach'' originally referred to the general area along the banks of the [[Shannon Estuary]] known as ''Loch Luimnigh''. The earliest settlement in the city, ''Inis Sibhtonn'', was the original name for King's Island during the pre-Viking and Viking eras. This island was also called ''Inis an Ghaill Duibh'', \"The Dark-(haired) Foreigner's Island\". The name is recorded in [[Viking]] sources as ''Hlymrekr''.\n\nThe city dates from 812 which is the earliest probable settlement; however, history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area surrounding King's Island, the island at the historical city centre. Antiquity's map-maker, Ptolemy, produced in 150 the earliest map of Ireland, showing a place called \"Regia\" at the same site as King's Island. History also records an important battle involving Cormac mac Airt in 221 and a visit by St. Patrick in 434 to baptise an E\u00f3ganachta king, Carthann the Fair. Saint Munchin, the first bishop of Limerick died in 652, indicating the city was a place of some note. In 812 the Vikings sailed up the Shannon and pillaged the city, burned the monastery of Mungret but were forced to flee when the Irish attacked and killed many of their number.{{fact|date=December 2019}} The Normans redesigned the city in the 12th century and added much of the most notable architecture, such as [[King John's Castle (Limerick)|King John's Castle]] and [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Limerick|St Mary's Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hodkinson|first=Brian|year=2002|title=The Topography of Pre-Norman Limerick|journal=North Munster Antiquarian Journal|volume=42|pages=1\u20136}}</ref>\n\nIn early medieval times Limerick was at the centre of the [[Kingdom of Thomond]] which corresponds to the present day County Clare, the Kingdom also included North Kerry and parts of South Offaly. One of the kingdom's most notable kings was [[Brian Boru]], ancestor of the O'Brien Clan of Dalcassians. The word Thomond is synonymous with the region and is retained in place names such as Thomondgate, Thomond Bridge and [[Thomond Park]].\n\n===Late Renaissance/Early modern history===\n[[File:DV405 no.235 Limerick.png|thumb|Limerick, painted in 1830]]\n[[File:George Street, Limerick (5691906290).jpg|thumb|Cannock's Department Store on O'Connell Street in the early 20th Century]]\n\nLimerick in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was often called the most beautiful city in Ireland.{{Attribution needed|date=September 2019}} The English-born judge [[Luke Gernon]], a resident of Limerick, wrote in 1620 that at his first sight of the city he had been amazed at its magnificence: \"lofty buildings of marble, like the Colleges in [[Oxford]]\".<ref>Gernon, Luke  ''A Discourse of Ireland'' 1620 edited by C.L. Falkiner 1904</ref>\n\nDuring the civil wars of the 17th century the city played a pivotal role, besieged by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1651 and twice by [[William III of England|the Williamites]] in the 1690s. The [[Treaty of Limerick]] ended the [[Williamite war in Ireland]] which was fought between supporters of the Catholic [[King James II]] (Jacobites) and the Protestant [[William III of England|King William of Orange]] (Williamites). The treaty offered toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]]. The Treaty was of national significance as it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. The articles of the Treaty protecting Catholic rights were not passed by the Protestant [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] which rather updated the [[Penal Laws]] against Catholics which had major implications for [[History of Ireland|Irish history]]. Reputedly the Treaty was signed on the Treaty Stone, an irregular block of limestone which once served as a mounting block for horses. This stone is now displayed on a pedestal at Clancy Strand. Because of the treaty, Limerick is sometimes known as the Treaty City. This turbulent period earned the city its motto: ''urbs antiqua fuit studisque asperrima belli'' (an ancient city well studied in the arts of war).\n\nThe peaceful times that followed the turmoil of the late 17th century allowed the city to prosper through trade in the late 18th century. During this time Limerick Port established itself as one of Ireland's major commercial ports exporting agricultural produce from one of Ireland's most fertile areas, the [[Golden Vale]], to Britain and America.<ref name=\"libraryireland.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryireland.com/topog/L/Limerick-Port.php|title=Limerick Port|publisher=libraryireland.com}}</ref> This increase in trade and wealth, particularly amongst the city's merchant classes saw a rapid expansion of the city as [[Newtown Pery, Limerick|Georgian Limerick]] began to take shape. This gave the city its present-day look including the extensive terraced streets of [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] townhouses which remain in the city centre today. The [[Waterford and Limerick Railway]] linked the city to the [[Dublin\u2013Cork railway line]] in 1848 and to [[Waterford]] in 1853. The opening of a number of secondary railways in the subsequent decades developed Limerick as a regional centre of communications.  However, the economic downturn in the European conflicts of the [[French Revolution]] and Napoleonic eras, and following the [[Act of Union 1800]], and the impact of the [[Great Irish Famine]] of 1848 caused much of the 19th century to be a more troubled period.\n\n===20th-century history===\n[[File:Limerick arms.jpg|thumb|City arms on a [[manhole cover]]]]\nThe [[Limerick boycott]] was an economic boycott waged against the small Jewish community for over two years in the first decade of the 20th century. It was accompanied by a number of assaults, stone throwing and intimidation, which caused many Jews to leave the city. It was instigated in 1904 by a Redemptorist priest, Father [[John Creagh]].\n\nDuring the [[Irish War of Independence]], the [[Limerick Soviet]] was a self-declared soviet that existed from 15 to 27 April 1919. A general strike was organised by the Limerick Trades and Labour Council, as a protest against the [[British Army]]'s declaration of a \"Special Military Area\" under the Defence of the Realm Act, which covered most of Limerick city and a part of the county. During the strike a special strike committee was set up to print their own money, control food prices and publish newspapers.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, Limerick was characterised by economic stagnation and decline as many traditional industries closed or left the city. However, there were some success stories. In 1942 [[Shannon Airport]] (located in County Clare, 20&nbsp;km west of the city) opened for the first time offering transatlantic flights. In 1959, Shannon Airport enabled the opening of the [[Shannon Free Zone]] which attracted a large number of multinational companies to the region. A long campaign for a third level educational institute to be located in the city finally bore fruit with the establishment of [[National Institute for Higher Education|NIHE Limerick]] in 1969 which eventually became the [[University of Limerick]] in 1989.\n\n==Government and politics==\n[[File:OConnell.JPG|thumb|left|[[O'Connell Street, Limerick]]]]\n{{Historical populations\n|state=collapsed\n|1659|3105\n|1821|59045\n|1831|66554\n|1841|48391\n|1851|48785\n|1861|43924\n|1871|39353\n|1881|38562\n|1891|37155\n|1901|38151\n|1911|38518\n|1926|39448\n|1936|41061\n|1946|42970\n|1951|50820\n|1956|51666\n|1961|51732\n|1966|58082\n|1971|57161\n|1979|60665\n|1981|60736\n|1986|56279\n|1991|52083\n|1996|52039\n|2002|54023\n|2006|59790\n|2011|56779\n||footnote=<ref>For 1653 and 1659 figures from Civil Survey Census of those years, Paper of Mr Hardinge to Royal Irish Academy 14 March 1865.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/census |title=Census for post 1821 figures |publisher=Cso.ie |accessdate=12 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309005718/http://www.cso.ie/census/ |archivedate=9 March 2005 }}</ref>{{Where|date=July 2011}}{{Specify|date=May 2011}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.histpop.org |title=Histpop.org |publisher=Histpop.org |date=2 April 2007 |accessdate=12 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507023856/http://www.histpop.org/ |archivedate=7 May 2016 }}</ref>{{Where|date=July 2011}}{{Specify|date=May 2011}}<ref>{{cite web|author=NISRA |url=http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census |title=Nisra.gov.uk |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=12 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217095720/http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census |archivedate=17 February 2012 }}</ref>{{Where|date=July 2011}}{{Specify|date=May 2011}}<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Lee\n|first=JJ\n|editor-last=Goldstrom\n|editor-first=J.

The Council has responsibility for local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing in the city. The council comprises elected [[Ward (politics)|ward]] [[Councillors]] with an appointed full-time CEO as the city (and county) manager. Local elections are held every five years and the Councillors annually elect a Cathaoirleach or chairman to chair the council. As of 2015, the Cathaoirleach was Cllr Liam Galvin from the Newcastle West electoral area.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/local-news/cllr-liam-galvin-elected-mayor-of-limerick-city-and-county-council-1-6820444|title=Cllr Liam Galvin elected Mayor of Limerick City and County Council|work=limerickleader.ie}}</ref> The 21 Councillors from the 3 electoral districts in the City Metropolitan Area also elect a mayor to represent the city. The Mayoral position is largely ceremonial and has much reduced responsibility following the merger of the Limerick local authorities.

The council was one of the oldest in Ireland and was only exceeded in age by [[Dublin City Council]]. In October 2012 the Government of Ireland published Putting People First- Action Programme for Effective Local Government which set out Government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local government in Ireland. Among the recommendations was the merging of Limerick City Council with [[Limerick County Council]]. The changes came into effect on 1 June 2014 following the implementation of the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html|title=Local authorities|work=citizensinformation.ie}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s onwards the city had outgrown its boundary considerably; the city boundary was only altered slightly and never reflected the overall urban area of the city. A limited boundary extension on the city's north side in 2008 enlarged the city boundary by 1,020 hectares increasing the city's area by almost 50% and raising the population by an estimated 7,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickcitydb.ie/CDBInfo/Strategy/documents/Strat%20for%20Eco%20Irish.pdf |title=Limerick City Development Board \u2013 Strategy for Economic and Social Development |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118205144/http://www.limerickcitydb.ie/CDBInfo/Strategy/documents/Strat%20for%20Eco%20Irish.pdf |archivedate=18 November 2007 }}</ref> The previous boundary, encompassing 2,086 hectares, was delineated in 1950. Newer suburban districts such as [[Dooradoyle]], [[Castletroy]] \u2013 including the [[University of Limerick|University]], Gouldavoher, and [[Raheen, County Limerick|Raheen]] were continually administered to by [[Limerick County Council]] until the merger of the two authorities in June 2014. This local government structure in Limerick caused a number of inefficiencies, most notably in the area of planning.

Met \u00c9ireann maintains a climatological weather station at [[Shannon Airport]], 20 kilometres west of the city in [[County Clare]]. Shannon Airport records an average of 977 millimetres of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. Limerick has a mild climate, with the average daily maximum in July of {{convert|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and the average daily minimum in January of {{convert|3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. The highest temperature recorded was {{convert|32.0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in June 2018, and the lowest {{convert|-11.4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in 2010. Limerick is the cloudiest city in the state, averaging only 1,295 sunshine hours annually, 3.5 hours of sunshine every day. There are on average 62 days of no recordable sunshine, 6 days of thunder, 22 days of hail and 11 days of snow per year. Shannon Airport is located by the ocean at an elevation of 14 metres, so snow is less common at the station than in the city itself.\n\n{{Weather box <!--Infobox begins-->\n|collapsed               = <!--Any entry in this line will make the template initially collapsed.

The museum was established to house a collection of approximately 2000 works of art and antiquities formed by [[John Hunt (antiquarian)|John and Gertrude Hunt]] during their lifetimes.\n\nThe main park in Limerick is the [[People's Park (Limerick)|People's Park]] which was opened in 1877 in memory of Richard Russell, a prominent local business man. The park is dominated by the Thomas Spring Rice memorial (MP for the city 1820\u20131832) and has a large collection of mature [[deciduous]] and evergreen trees.\n\nLimerick city centre changed significantly with the construction of several modern high-rise buildings in the early 2000s, in particular as part of the regeneration of the former docks area along the Dock Road. The suburban areas, where the majority of the population now live, have grown out from the centre along the main roads to Ennis (North Circular and Ennis Road areas/[[Caherdavin]]), Dublin ([[Castletroy]] and the University) and Cork (Ballinacurra/Dooradoyle/Raheen). Suburban houses are generally two-floor semi-detached homes for single families. These were built from the 1950s onwards in large estates by government projects and commercial developments, although there are many examples of Edwardian and older 1930s suburban homes on the main suburban thoroughfares leading towards the city (North & South Circular, Ballinacurra Road, O'Connell Avenue).\n\n[[File:O'Connell Monument to Daniel O'Connell at O'Connell Avenue, Limerick City.jpg|thumb|left|O'Connell Monument to Daniel O'Connell at The Crescent]]\n\nLimerick city's nightlife is supported by a number of nightclubs and pubs which offer music.

Limerick Chamber of Commerce, a representative body for businesses in the region, celebrated its bicentennial/bicentenary in 2015.\n\nHistorically Limerick was an agricultural commodity-driven economy, due to its position as the first major port along the River Shannon.

Vikings established the city as a maritime trading port. The city's position on a major Irish river system, the [[River Shannon|Shannon]], enabled transport to the midlands of Ireland and further north and west. By the 18th century with the opening of canal systems throughout Ireland, Limerick Port established itself as Ireland's premier commercial port on the western side of the country. This was enabled by ease of access from the facilitated by the opening of canals but most importantly to the River Shannon. The opening of the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]] in the 18th century provided further access to Dublin and the east of the country. There are also a number of disused canals in the vicinity of the city including the Park Canal & the Passey \u2013 Errina Canal on the old Limerick navigation. Waterway transport on the Shannon was regularly used to transport goods from Limerick to Dublin and vice versa however this mode of transport fell into decline in the 20th century. Originally Limerick port was located near the confluence of the Abbey and Shannon rivers at [[King's Island, Limerick|King's Island]]. Today the [[Shannon Foynes Port]] is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road. This general purpose facility portis operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company who operate all marine activities in the Shannon estuary.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Education==\n[[File:University of Limerick Plassey House.jpeg|thumb|Plassey House at the [[University of Limerick]].]]\n[[File:LITPanorama.JPG|thumb|[[Limerick Institute of Technology]]]]\nLimerick is an centre of higher education in the region, and technical and continuation education within the city traces its beginning back to the formation of the [[Limerick Athenaeum]] Society in 1852, marking the foundation of the [[Limerick Institute of Technology]].
