It appears again in the [[Old Persian]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and [[Aramaic]] inscriptions of [[Darius I]] and [[Xerxes I]] among lists of subject peoples and countries. It is subsequently also identified as the source of the ivory used in Darius' palace at Susa. In the [[Behistun inscription]] (DB 3.54-76), the King recounts that a [[Fars Province|Persian]] was thrice defeated by the Achaemenid governor of Arachosia, Vivana, who so ensured that the province remained under Darius' control. It has been suggested that this \"strategically unintelligible engagement\" was ventured by the rebel because \"there were close relations between [[Fars Province|Persia]] and Arachosia concerning the Zoroastrian faith.\"<ref name=Iranicaarticle />\n\n[[File:Alexander in Arachosia 329 BCE.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alexander the Great]] in Arachosia, 329 BCE.]]\nThe chronologically next reference to Arachosia comes from the Greeks and Romans, who record that under [[Darius III]] the Arachosians and Drangians were under the command of a governor who, together with the army of the Bactrian governor, contrived a plot of the Arachosians against [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] ([[Curtius Rufus]] 8.13.3). Following Alexander's conquest of the Achaemenids, the Macedonian appointed his generals as governors (Arrian 3.28.1, 5.6.2; Curtius Rufus 7.3.5; Plutarch, Eumenes 19.3; Polyaenus 4.6.15; Diodorus 18.3.3; Orosius 3.23.1 3; Justin 13.4.22).\n\nFollowing the [[Partition of Babylon]], the region became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]], which traded it to the [[Mauryan Empire]] in 305 BCE as part of an alliance. The [[Shunga dynasty]] overthrew the Mauryans in 185 BC, but shortly afterwards lost Arachosia to the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]]. It then became part of the break-away [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] in the mid 2nd century BCE. [[Indo-Scythians]] expelled the Indo-Greeks by the mid 1st century BCE, but lost the region to the [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]]s and [[Indo-Parthians]]. At what time (and in what form) Parthian rule over Arachosia was reestablished cannot be determined with any authenticity.  From Isidore 19 it is certain that a part (perhaps only a little) of the region was under Arsacid rule in the 1st century CE, and that the Parthians called it ''Indik\u0113 Leuk\u0113'', \"White India.\"<ref name=\"William Woodthorpe Tarn\">{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-HeJS3nE9cAC&pg=PA53&dq=sakastan+white#v=onepage&q=sakastan%20white&f=false|title=The Greeks in Bactria and India|publisher =Cambridge University Press|accessdate = 2007-12-31|isbn = 978-1-108-00941-6|date = 2010-06-24}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] captured Arachosia from the Indo-Parthians and ruled the region until around 230 CE, when they were defeated by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]], the second Persian Empire, after which the Kushans were replaced by Sassanid vassals known as the [[Kushanshas]] or [[Indo-Sassanids]]. In 420 CE the Kushanshas were driven out of present Afghanistan by the [[Chionites]], who established the [[Kidarite Kingdom]]. The [[Kidarites]] were replaced in the 460s CE by the [[Hephthalites]], who were defeated in 565 CE by a coalition of Persian and Turkish armies. Arachosia became part of the surviving [[Kushano-Hephthalite]] Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Kapisa|Kapisa]], then [[Kabul]], before coming under attack from the Moslem Arabs. These kingdoms were at first vassals of Sassanids. Around 870 CE the Kushano-Hephthalites (aka Turkshahi Dynasty) was replaced by the [[Hindu Shahi]] dynasty, which fell to the Muslim Turkish [[Ghaznavids]] in the early 11th century CE.\n\nArab geographers referred to the region (or parts of it) as 'Arokhaj', 'Rokhaj', 'Rohkaj' or simply 'Roh'.\n\n==Religion==\nArachosia retained [[Zoroastrian]] religious and cultural influence until the advent of [[Islam]] in the 7th century. Much of the country remained Zoroastrian even while in Arab hands, but within a few centuries Islam became the region's dominant religion. See [[Sistan]] for information on the religion of the area after the Arab conquest.\n\n==Theory of Croatian Iranian origin==\nThe theory of Croatian origin traces the origin of the [[Croats]] to the area of Arachosia. This connection was at first drawn due to the similarity of Croatian ([[Croatia]] - [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: Hrvatska, Croats - Croatian: [[Name of Croatia#Origin|Hrvati]] / [[\u010cakavian dialect]]: Harvati / [[Kajkavian dialect]]: Horvati) and Arachosian name,<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|title=Identity of Croatians in Ancient Afghanistan|publisher=iranchamber.com|location=|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/identity_croatians_ancient_iran.php}}.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kalyanaraman|first=Srinivasan|title=Sarasvati Civilization Volume 1|publisher=Babasaheb (Umakanta Keshav) Apte Smarak Samiti|location=Bangalore|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/2250823/Civilization}}.</ref> but other researches indicate that there are also linguistic, cultural, agrobiological and genetic ties.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Budimir/Rac|first=Stipan/Mladen|title=Anthropogenic and agrobiological arguments of the scientific origin of Croats|publisher=Staroiransko podrijetlo Hrvata : zbornik simpozija / Lovri\u0107, Andrija-\u017deljko (ed). - Teheran : Iranian Cultural Center |location=Zagreb|url=http://crosbi.znanstvenici.hr/prikazi-rad?&lang=EN&rad=37738}}.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Abbas|first=Samar|title=Common Origin of Croats, Serbs and Jats|publisher=iranchamber.com|location=Bhubaneshwar|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/common_origin_croats_serbs_jats.php}}.</ref> Since Croatia became an independent state in 1991, the Iranian theory gained more popularity, and many scientific papers and books have been published.<ref>Beshevliev 1967: \"Iranian elements in the Proto-Bulgarians\" by V.

Isidore, [[Strabo]] (11.8.9) and [[Pliny the elder|Pliny]] (6.61) also refer to the city as \"metropolis of Arachosia.\"\n\nIn his list, Ptolemy also refers to a city named Arachotus ({{lang-en|Arachote}} {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u00e6r|\u0259|k|o\u028a|t}}; {{lang-el|{{lang|grc|\u1f08\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}}}}) or Arachoti (acc. to [[Strabo]]), which was the earlier capital of the land. [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Stephen of Byzantium]] mention that its original name was Cophen (\u039a\u03c9\u03c6\u03ae\u03bd).

Despite attempts to connect the Eoritae with the \"Arattas\" of the [[Mahabharata]] or with present-day [[Aroras]], who populated this land and migrated to India after [[partition of India|partition]],{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} the identity of these tribes is unknown, and even Ptolemy's orthography is disputed (\"Pargyetae\" is sometimes rewritten \"Parsyetae\" or \"Aparytae\").\n\n==History==\n{{Further|History of Afghanistan}}\n[[File:Embassy of Megasthenes.jpg|thumb|According to [[Arrian]], [[Megasthenes]] lived in Arachosia and travelled to [[Pataliputra]], to the court of [[Chandragupta Maurya]].]]\nThe region is first referred to in the [[Achaemenid]]-era [[Elamite]] Persepolis fortification tablets. It appears again in the [[Old Persian]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and [[Aramaic]] inscriptions of [[Darius I]] and [[Xerxes I]] among lists of subject peoples and countries. It is subsequently also identified as the source of the ivory used in Darius' palace at Susa. In the [[Behistun inscription]] (DB 3.54-76), the King recounts that a [[Fars Province|Persian]] was thrice defeated by the Achaemenid governor of Arachosia, Vivana, who so ensured that the province remained under Darius' control. It has been suggested that this \"strategically unintelligible engagement\" was ventured by the rebel because \"there were close relations between [[Fars Province|Persia]] and Arachosia concerning the Zoroastrian faith.\"<ref name=Iranicaarticle />\n\n[[File:Alexander in Arachosia 329 BCE.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alexander the Great]] in Arachosia, 329 BCE.]]\nThe chronologically next reference to Arachosia comes from the Greeks and Romans, who record that under [[Darius III]] the Arachosians and Drangians were under the command of a governor who, together with the army of the Bactrian governor, contrived a plot of the Arachosians against [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] ([[Curtius Rufus]] 8.13.3). Following Alexander's conquest of the Achaemenids, the Macedonian appointed his generals as governors (Arrian 3.28.1, 5.6.2; Curtius Rufus 7.3.5; Plutarch, Eumenes 19.3; Polyaenus 4.6.15; Diodorus 18.3.3; Orosius 3.23.1 3; Justin 13.4.22).\n\nFollowing the [[Partition of Babylon]], the region became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]], which traded it to the [[Mauryan Empire]] in 305 BCE as part of an alliance. The [[Shunga dynasty]] overthrew the Mauryans in 185 BC, but shortly afterwards lost Arachosia to the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]]. It then became part of the break-away [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] in the mid 2nd century BCE. [[Indo-Scythians]] expelled the Indo-Greeks by the mid 1st century BCE, but lost the region to the [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]]s and [[Indo-Parthians]]. At what time (and in what form) Parthian rule over Arachosia was reestablished cannot be determined with any authenticity.  From Isidore 19 it is certain that a part (perhaps only a little) of the region was under Arsacid rule in the 1st century CE, and that the Parthians called it ''Indik\u0113 Leuk\u0113'', \"White India.\"<ref name=\"William Woodthorpe Tarn\">{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-HeJS3nE9cAC&pg=PA53&dq=sakastan+white#v=onepage&q=sakastan%20white&f=false|title=The Greeks in Bactria and India|publisher =Cambridge University Press|accessdate = 2007-12-31|isbn = 978-1-108-00941-6|date = 2010-06-24}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] captured Arachosia from the Indo-Parthians and ruled the region until around 230 CE, when they were defeated by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]], the second Persian Empire, after which the Kushans were replaced by Sassanid vassals known as the [[Kushanshas]] or [[Indo-Sassanids]]. In 420 CE the Kushanshas were driven out of present Afghanistan by the [[Chionites]], who established the [[Kidarite Kingdom]]. The [[Kidarites]] were replaced in the 460s CE by the [[Hephthalites]], who were defeated in 565 CE by a coalition of Persian and Turkish armies. Arachosia became part of the surviving [[Kushano-Hephthalite]] Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Kapisa|Kapisa]], then [[Kabul]], before coming under attack from the Moslem Arabs. These kingdoms were at first vassals of Sassanids. Around 870 CE the Kushano-Hephthalites (aka Turkshahi Dynasty) was replaced by the [[Hindu Shahi]] dynasty, which fell to the Muslim Turkish [[Ghaznavids]] in the early 11th century CE.\n\nArab geographers referred to the region (or parts of it) as 'Arokhaj', 'Rokhaj', 'Rohkaj' or simply 'Roh'.\n\n==Religion==\nArachosia retained [[Zoroastrian]] religious and cultural influence until the advent of [[Islam]] in the 7th century. Much of the country remained Zoroastrian even while in Arab hands, but within a few centuries Islam became the region's dominant religion. See [[Sistan]] for information on the religion of the area after the Arab conquest.\n\n==Theory of Croatian Iranian origin==\nThe theory of Croatian origin traces the origin of the [[Croats]] to the area of Arachosia. This connection was at first drawn due to the similarity of Croatian ([[Croatia]] - [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: Hrvatska, Croats - Croatian: [[Name of Croatia#Origin|Hrvati]] / [[\u010cakavian dialect]]: Harvati / [[Kajkavian dialect]]: Horvati) and Arachosian name,<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|title=Identity of Croatians in Ancient Afghanistan|publisher=iranchamber.com|location=|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/identity_croatians_ancient_iran.php}}.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kalyanaraman|first=Srinivasan|title=Sarasvati Civilization Volume 1|publisher=Babasaheb (Umakanta Keshav) Apte Smarak Samiti|location=Bangalore|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/2250823/Civilization}}.</ref> but other researches indicate that there are also linguistic, cultural, agrobiological and genetic ties.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Budimir/Rac|first=Stipan/Mladen|title=Anthropogenic and agrobiological arguments of the scientific origin of Croats|publisher=Staroiransko podrijetlo Hrvata : zbornik simpozija / Lovri\u0107, Andrija-\u017deljko (ed). - Teheran : Iranian Cultural Center |location=Zagreb|url=http://crosbi.znanstvenici.hr/prikazi-rad?&lang=EN&rad=37738}}.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Abbas|first=Samar|title=Common Origin of Croats, Serbs and Jats|publisher=iranchamber.com|location=Bhubaneshwar|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/common_origin_croats_serbs_jats.php}}.</ref> Since Croatia became an independent state in 1991, the Iranian theory gained more popularity, and many scientific papers and books have been published.<ref>Beshevliev 1967: \"Iranian elements in the Proto-Bulgarians\" by V.
