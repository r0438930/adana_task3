George]], a [[furrier]] who raised [[chinchillas]] and supplied furs to the movie studios.\n\nGeorge's first instrument was the [[harmonica]]. At the age of six he appeared on ''[[Original Amateur Hour|Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour]]'' performing a duet with his older brother, Hampton. As a student at [[Hollywood High School]] (where he befriended [[Paul Barrere]] and future wife Elizabeth), he took up the [[flute]] in the school [[marching band]] and orchestra. He had already started to play Hampton's [[acoustic guitar]] at age 11, progressed to the [[electric guitar]] by his high school years, and later learned to play the [[saxophone]], [[shakuhachi]] and [[sitar]]. During this period, George viewed the [[teen idol]]-oriented [[rock and roll]] of the era with contempt, instead favoring [[West Coast jazz]] and the [[soul jazz]] of [[Les McCann]] and [[Mose Allison]]. Following graduation in 1963, he briefly worked at a gas station (an experience that inspired such later songs as \"[[Willin' (Little Feat song)|Willin']]\") to support himself while studying art and [[art history]] at [[Los Angeles Valley College]] for two years.\n\n==Musical career==\n===Early bands===\nInitially funded by the sale of his grandfather's stock, George's first band The Factory formed in 1965 and released at least one single on the [[Uni Records]] label, \"Smile, Let Your Life Begin\" (co-written by George). Members included future Little Feat drummer [[Richie Hayward]] (who replaced [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)|Dallas Taylor]] in September 1966), Martin Kibbee (a.k.a. Fred Martin) who would later co-write several Little Feat songs with George (including \"Dixie Chicken\" and \"Rock and Roll Doctor\"), and [[Warren Klein]] on guitar. [[Frank Zappa]] produced two tracks for the band, but they were not released until 1993 on the album ''Lightning-Rod Man'', credited to Lowell George and The Factory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/related/Lightning-Rod_Man.html |title=Lowell George & The Factory \u2013 Lightning-Rod Man|publisher=Globalia.net|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> The band made an appearance on the 1960s sitcom ''[[F Troop]]'' as \"The Bedbugs\". They were also featured in an episode of ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'', \"Lost, the Colonel's Daughter\" (season 3, episode 27). They appeared in the scene inside the A-Go-Go club, with their music heard playing loudly. They received credits at the end of the episode as \"'The Factory' Lowell-Warren-Martin-Rich, Courtesy of Universal Records\". Following the disbanding of The Factory, George briefly joined [[The Standells]].\n\n===Zappa and The Mothers of Invention===\nIn November 1968, George joined Zappa's [[The Mothers of Invention|Mothers of Invention]] as rhythm guitarist and nominal lead vocalist; he can be heard on ''[[Weasels Ripped My Flesh]]'', ''[[Burnt Weeny Sandwich]]'', ''[[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 1]]'', ''[[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 4]]'' and the first disc of ''[[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 5]]''. During this period, he absorbed Zappa's autocratic leadership style and [[avant garde]]-influenced conceptual/procedural-oriented compositional methods. He earned his first production credit (in conjunction with Zappa and [[Russ Titelman]]) on ''Permanent Damage'', an album recorded by \"[[groupie]] group\" [[The GTOs]]. George later asserted that \"he performed no real function in the band\" and left the group in May 1969 under nebulous circumstances. GTOs member [[Pamela Des Barres]] has claimed that George was fired by Zappa for smoking [[marijuana]], while George claimed at a 1975 Little Feat concert that he was fired because he \"wrote a song [\"Willin'\"] about dope.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/lf1975-10-18.shnf | title=Willin' | date = October 18, 1975 | work = Little Feat Live at Auditorium Theatre | publisher= The Internet Archive | accessdate= December 22, 2012}}</ref> On the other hand, biographer Mark Brend asserts that Zappa liked the song but thought there was no place for it in the Mothers' set; George himself alternatively claimed that \"it was decided that I should leave and form a band\" by mutual agreement. George also claimed to have played uncredited guitar on ''[[Hot Rats]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Electric Don Quixote |author=Neil Slaven |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaGs3UTVm1sC |pages=141\u2013144 |date=2003-03-01 |isbn=978-0-7119-9436-2}}</ref>\n\n===Little Feat===\n[[File:Little Feat Lowell George.jpg|thumb|240px|George performing in [[Buffalo, New York]], May 1, 1977]]\nAfter leaving the Mothers of Invention, George invited fellow musicians former Zappa bassist [[Roy Estrada]], keyboardist [[Bill Payne]], and drummer [[Richie Hayward]] to form a new band, which they named [[Little Feat]]. George usually (but not always) played lead guitar and focused on slide guitar, but [[Ry Cooder]] played the slide on \"Willin'\" on the debut Little Feat album after George badly injured his hand while working on a powered model airplane, although George rerecorded some of his material and he played the rest of the slide work on the album. Mark Brend wrote that George's \"use of [[Compression (electric guitar)|compression]] defined his sound and gave him the means to play his extended melodic lines.\"<ref>Rock and Roll Doctor\u2014Lowell George: Guitarist, Songwriter and Founder of Little Feat, by Mark Brend, Backbeat Books, Oct. 2002, p.75,</ref> George began his slide playing using the casing of a [[Sears|Sears, Roebuck and Co.]] 11/16ths [[spark plug]] socket wrench, rather than the traditional glass or steel finger tube.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tz_HDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT61|title=Brian Jones|first=Alan|last=Clayson|date=February 2, 2004|publisher=Bobcat Books|accessdate=May 4, 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/06/little-feat-teenage-nervous-breakdown.html|title=Teenage Nervous Breakdown - Little Feat - Feb 14, 1976|publisher=|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nLittle Feat signed to [[Warner Bros.

In addition, Little Feat expanded to a sextet by adding a second guitarist [[Paul Barrere]] and percussionist [[Sam Clayton]], thus cementing the classic line-up, and they took on a [[New Orleans]] funk direction with their next album ''[[Dixie Chicken (album)|Dixie Chicken]]'', the first to be produced by George.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dixie-chicken-mw0000190703|title=Dixie Chicken - Little Feat - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=December 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy the spring of 1976, Little Feat were touring North America opening for The Who.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book \n| first= Martin C.\n| last= Strong\n| year= 2000\n| title= The Great Rock Discography\n| edition= 5th\n| publisher= Mojo Books\n| location= Edinburgh\n| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>\n\n{{Listen|filename=On Your Way Down.ogg|title=\"On Your Way Down\"|description=written by [[Allen Toussaint]], from the 1973 [[Little Feat]] album ''[[Dixie Chicken (album)|Dixie Chicken]]''|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nLittle Feat released several other  studio albums in the 1970s, including: ''[[Feats Don't Fail Me Now]]'', ''[[The Last Record Album]]'' and ''[[Time Loves a Hero]]''. The group's 1978 live album ''[[Waiting for Columbus]]'' became their best-selling album.\n\nTensions within the group, especially between George, Payne, and, to a lesser extent, Barrere regarding musical direction and leadership, led to Payne and Barrere's departure from the group in 1979 and the group's subsequent disbandment. In an interview with Bill Flanagan conducted 11 days before his death, George stated that he was keen to re-form Little Feat without Payne and Barrere in order to reassert his full control over the group.<ref>'Written in My Soul' by Bill Flanagan {{ISBN|0-7119-2224-1}} pp. 353-63.</ref>\n\n===Record production===\nGeorge was also a producer, and produced the [[Grateful Dead]]'s 1978 album ''[[Shakedown Street]]'', as well as Little Feat's records and his own 1979 solo album ''[[Thanks, I'll Eat It Here]]''; he also co-produced a couple of tracks on [[Valerie Carter]]'s 1977 release ''Just A Stone's Throw Away''. In 1977 he co-produced [[The Seldom Scene|John Starling]]'s debut solo album ''Long Time Gone''.\n\n===Session work===\nWhen not playing with Little Feat, George lent his talents as a [[session musician|session player]] to various artists, most frequently as a slide guitarist.

A year later, Palmer's second album (''[[Pressure Drop (album)|Pressure Drop]]'') was effectively produced by George, and Little Feat served as the core band on the sessions. However, Palmer kept the producer's credit because of a dispute between [[Island Records]] and Warners. Later CDs list Steve Smith as producer.\n\n==Health problems==\nGeorge led an overindulgent lifestyle of [[binge eating]], [[alcoholism]] and [[speedball (drug)|speedballs]] ([[heroin]] and [[cocaine]] mixed together) and he became [[morbidly obese]] in the last years of his life, weighing 308 pounds (140 kg).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/aug/30/artsfeatures |title=The late, great Lowell George|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=January 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn June 15, 1979, George began a tour in support of his solo album, ''Thanks I'll Eat it Here''.

[[Frank Zappa]] produced two tracks for the band, but they were not released until 1993 on the album ''Lightning-Rod Man'', credited to Lowell George and The Factory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/related/Lightning-Rod_Man.html |title=Lowell George & The Factory \u2013 Lightning-Rod Man|publisher=Globalia.net|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> The band made an appearance on the 1960s sitcom ''[[F Troop]]'' as \"The Bedbugs\". They were also featured in an episode of ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'', \"Lost, the Colonel's Daughter\" (season 3, episode 27). They appeared in the scene inside the A-Go-Go club, with their music heard playing loudly. They received credits at the end of the episode as \"'The Factory' Lowell-Warren-Martin-Rich, Courtesy of Universal Records\". Following the disbanding of The Factory, George briefly joined [[The Standells]].\n\n===Zappa and The Mothers of Invention===\nIn November 1968, George joined Zappa's [[The Mothers of Invention|Mothers of Invention]] as rhythm guitarist and nominal lead vocalist; he can be heard on ''[[Weasels Ripped My Flesh]]'', ''[[Burnt Weeny Sandwich]]'', ''[[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 1]]'', ''[[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 4]]'' and the first disc of ''[[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 5]]''. During this period, he absorbed Zappa's autocratic leadership style and [[avant garde]]-influenced conceptual/procedural-oriented compositional methods. He earned his first production credit (in conjunction with Zappa and [[Russ Titelman]]) on ''Permanent Damage'', an album recorded by \"[[groupie]] group\" [[The GTOs]]. George later asserted that \"he performed no real function in the band\" and left the group in May 1969 under nebulous circumstances. GTOs member [[Pamela Des Barres]] has claimed that George was fired by Zappa for smoking [[marijuana]], while George claimed at a 1975 Little Feat concert that he was fired because he \"wrote a song [\"Willin'\"] about dope.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/lf1975-10-18.shnf | title=Willin' | date = October 18, 1975 | work = Little Feat Live at Auditorium Theatre | publisher= The Internet Archive | accessdate= December 22, 2012}}</ref> On the other hand, biographer Mark Brend asserts that Zappa liked the song but thought there was no place for it in the Mothers' set; George himself alternatively claimed that \"it was decided that I should leave and form a band\" by mutual agreement. George also claimed to have played uncredited guitar on ''[[Hot Rats]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Electric Don Quixote |author=Neil Slaven |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaGs3UTVm1sC |pages=141\u2013144 |date=2003-03-01 |isbn=978-0-7119-9436-2}}</ref>\n\n===Little Feat===\n[[File:Little Feat Lowell George.jpg|thumb|240px|George performing in [[Buffalo, New York]], May 1, 1977]]\nAfter leaving the Mothers of Invention, George invited fellow musicians former Zappa bassist [[Roy Estrada]], keyboardist [[Bill Payne]], and drummer [[Richie Hayward]] to form a new band, which they named [[Little Feat]]. George usually (but not always) played lead guitar and focused on slide guitar, but [[Ry Cooder]] played the slide on \"Willin'\" on the debut Little Feat album after George badly injured his hand while working on a powered model airplane, although George rerecorded some of his material and he played the rest of the slide work on the album. Mark Brend wrote that George's \"use of [[Compression (electric guitar)|compression]] defined his sound and gave him the means to play his extended melodic lines.\"<ref>Rock and Roll Doctor\u2014Lowell George: Guitarist, Songwriter and Founder of Little Feat, by Mark Brend, Backbeat Books, Oct. 2002, p.75,</ref> George began his slide playing using the casing of a [[Sears|Sears, Roebuck and Co.]] 11/16ths [[spark plug]] socket wrench, rather than the traditional glass or steel finger tube.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tz_HDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT61|title=Brian Jones|first=Alan|last=Clayson|date=February 2, 2004|publisher=Bobcat Books|accessdate=May 4, 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/06/little-feat-teenage-nervous-breakdown.html|title=Teenage Nervous Breakdown - Little Feat - Feb 14, 1976|publisher=|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nLittle Feat signed to [[Warner Bros.

In addition, Little Feat expanded to a sextet by adding a second guitarist [[Paul Barrere]] and percussionist [[Sam Clayton]], thus cementing the classic line-up, and they took on a [[New Orleans]] funk direction with their next album ''[[Dixie Chicken (album)|Dixie Chicken]]'', the first to be produced by George.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dixie-chicken-mw0000190703|title=Dixie Chicken - Little Feat - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=December 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy the spring of 1976, Little Feat were touring North America opening for The Who.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book \n| first= Martin C.\n| last= Strong\n| year= 2000\n| title= The Great Rock Discography\n| edition= 5th\n| publisher= Mojo Books\n| location= Edinburgh\n| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>\n\n{{Listen|filename=On Your Way Down.ogg|title=\"On Your Way Down\"|description=written by [[Allen Toussaint]], from the 1973 [[Little Feat]] album ''[[Dixie Chicken (album)|Dixie Chicken]]''|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nLittle Feat released several other  studio albums in the 1970s, including: ''[[Feats Don't Fail Me Now]]'', ''[[The Last Record Album]]'' and ''[[Time Loves a Hero]]''. The group's 1978 live album ''[[Waiting for Columbus]]'' became their best-selling album.\n\nTensions within the group, especially between George, Payne, and, to a lesser extent, Barrere regarding musical direction and leadership, led to Payne and Barrere's departure from the group in 1979 and the group's subsequent disbandment. In an interview with Bill Flanagan conducted 11 days before his death, George stated that he was keen to re-form Little Feat without Payne and Barrere in order to reassert his full control over the group.<ref>'Written in My Soul' by Bill Flanagan {{ISBN|0-7119-2224-1}} pp. 353-63.</ref>\n\n===Record production===\nGeorge was also a producer, and produced the [[Grateful Dead]]'s 1978 album ''[[Shakedown Street]]'', as well as Little Feat's records and his own 1979 solo album ''[[Thanks, I'll Eat It Here]]''; he also co-produced a couple of tracks on [[Valerie Carter]]'s 1977 release ''Just A Stone's Throw Away''. In 1977 he co-produced [[The Seldom Scene|John Starling]]'s debut solo album ''Long Time Gone''.\n\n===Session work===\nWhen not playing with Little Feat, George lent his talents as a [[session musician|session player]] to various artists, most frequently as a slide guitarist.

A year later, Palmer's second album (''[[Pressure Drop (album)|Pressure Drop]]'') was effectively produced by George, and Little Feat served as the core band on the sessions. However, Palmer kept the producer's credit because of a dispute between [[Island Records]] and Warners. Later CDs list Steve Smith as producer.\n\n==Health problems==\nGeorge led an overindulgent lifestyle of [[binge eating]], [[alcoholism]] and [[speedball (drug)|speedballs]] ([[heroin]] and [[cocaine]] mixed together) and he became [[morbidly obese]] in the last years of his life, weighing 308 pounds (140 kg).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/aug/30/artsfeatures |title=The late, great Lowell George|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=January 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn June 15, 1979, George began a tour in support of his solo album, ''Thanks I'll Eat it Here''.
