'''Battleford''' ([[Canada 2011 Census|2011 population]] 4,065) is a small town located across the [[North Saskatchewan River]] from the City of [[North Battleford]], in [[Saskatchewan]], Canada.

Battleford and North Battleford are collectively referred to as \"The Battlefords\" by Saskatchewan residents, as well as on highway signage. Although there has been occasional talk of the two communities merging, as of 2012 they remain separate entities. The local economy is fuelled mainly by agriculture. Battleford is bordered by the [[Battle River No. 438, Saskatchewan|Rural Municipality of Battle River No. 438]], as well as by the city of North Battleford and a small section of the [[North Battleford No. 437, Saskatchewan|Rural Municipality of North Battleford No. 437]].

The 1973 western ''[[Alien Thunder]]'' was partially filmed in Battleford.

changing some notation from old italicized to more readable TeX,safe,Phokoro,"In [[mathematics]], a '''volume form''' on a [[differentiable manifold]] is a top-dimensional form (i.e., a [[differential form]] of top degree).   Thus on a manifold <math>M</math> of dimension <math>n</math>, a volume form is an <math>n</math>-form, a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[line bundle]] <math>\\Omega^n(M)=\\bigwedge^n(T^*M)</math>.  A manifold admits a nowhere-vanishing volume form if and only if it is orientable. An [[orientable manifold]] has infinitely many volume forms, since multiplying a volume form by a function yields another volume form. On non-orientable manifolds, one may instead define the weaker notion of a [[Density on a manifold|density]].

A volume form provides a means to define the [[integral]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] on a differentiable manifold.  In other words, a volume form gives rise to a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] with respect to which functions can be integrated by the appropriate [[Lebesgue integral]].  The absolute value of a volume form is a [[volume element]], which is also known variously as a ''twisted volume form'' or ''pseudo-volume form''.  It also defines a measure, but exists on any differentiable manifold, orientable or not.

[[Kähler manifold]]s, being [[complex manifold]]s, are naturally oriented, and so possess a volume form.  More generally, the <math>n</math>th [[exterior power]] of the symplectic form on a [[symplectic manifold]] is a volume form. Many classes of manifolds have canonical volume forms: they have extra structure which allows the choice of a preferred volume form.  Oriented [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s have an associated canonical volume form.

== Orientation ==
A manifold is [[orientable]] if it has a [[coordinate atlas]] all of whose transition functions have positive [[Jacobian determinant]]s.  A selection of a maximal such atlas is an orientation on <math>M</math>.  A volume form <math>\\omega</math> on <math>M</math> gives rise to an orientation in a natural way as the atlas of coordinate charts on <math>M</math> that send <math>\\omega</math> to a positive multiple of the Euclidean volume form <math>dx^1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^n</math>.

A volume form also allows for the specification of a preferred class of [[moving frame|frames]] on <math>M</math>. Call a basis of tangent vectors <math>(X_1, \\ldots, X_n)</math> right-handed if

:<math>\\omega(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n) > 0.</math>

The collection of all right-handed frames is [[Group action (mathematics)|acted upon]] by the [[group (mathematics)|group]] <math>GL^+(n)</math> of [[general linear group|general linear]] mappings in <math>n</math> dimensions with positive determinant.  They form a [[principal bundle|principal <math>GL^+(n)</math> sub-bundle]] of the [[linear frame bundle]] of <math>M</math>, and so the orientation associated to a volume form gives a canonical reduction of the frame bundle of <math>M</math> to a sub-bundle with structure group <math>GL^+(n)</math>.  That is to say that a volume form gives rise to [[G-structure|<math>GL^+(n)</math>-structure]] on <math>M</math>.  More reduction is clearly possible by considering frames that have

{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\omega(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n) = 1.</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Thus a volume form gives rise to an <math>SL(n)</math>-structure as well.  Conversely, given an <math>SL(n)</math>-structure, one can recover a volume form by imposing ({{EquationNote|1}}) for the special linear frames and then solving for the required <math>n</math>-form <math>\\omega</math> by requiring homogeneity in its arguments.

A manifold is orientable if and only if it has a volume form.  Indeed, <math>SL(n) \\to GL^+(n)</math> is a [[deformation retract]] since <math>GL^+ = SL \\times \\mathbb{R}^+</math>, where the [[positive reals]] are embedded as scalar matrices.  Thus every <math>GL^+(n)</math>-structure is reducible to an <math>SL(n)</math>-structure, and <math>GL^+(n)</math>-structures coincide with orientations on <math>M</math>.  More concretely, triviality of the determinant bundle <math>\\Omega^n(M)</math> is equivalent to orientability, and a line bundle is trivial if and only if it has a nowhere-vanishing section. Thus the existence of a volume form is equivalent to orientability.

== Relation to measures ==
{{See also|Density on a manifold}}
Given a volume form <math>\\omega</math> on an oriented manifold, the [[density on a manifold|density]] <math>|\\omega|</math> is a volume [[pseudotensor|pseudo-form]] on the nonoriented manifold obtained by forgetting the orientation. Densities may also be defined more generally on non-orientable manifolds.

Any volume pseudo-form <math>\\omega</math> (and therefore also any volume form) defines a measure on the [[Borel set]]s by
:<math>\\mu_\\omega(U)=\\int_U\\omega .</math>

The difference is that while a measure can be integrated over a (Borel) ''subset'', a volume form can only be integrated over an ''oriented'' cell. In single variable [[calculus]], writing <math>\\int_b^a f\\,dx = -\\int_a^b f\\,dx</math> considers <math>dx</math> as a volume form, not simply a measure, and <math>\\int_b^a</math> indicates \"integrate over the cell <math>[a,b]</math> with the opposite orientation, sometimes denoted <math>\\overline{[a,b]}</math>\".

Further, general measures need not be continuous or smooth: they need not be defined by a volume form, or more formally, their [[Radon–Nikodym derivative]] with respect to a given volume form need not be [[absolutely continuous]].

==Divergence==
Given a volume form ''ω'' on ''M'', one can define the [[divergence]] of a [[vector field]] ''X'' as the unique scalar-valued function, denoted by div&nbsp;''X'', satisfying

:<math>(\\operatorname{div} X)\\omega = L_X\\omega = d(X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega) ,</math>

where ''L''<sub>''X''</sub> denotes the [[Lie derivative]] along ''X'' and <math>X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega</math> denotes the [[interior product]] or the left [[tensor contraction|contraction]] of ''ω'' along ''X''. If ''X'' is a [[compact support|compactly supported]] vector field and ''M'' is a [[manifold with boundary]], then [[Stokes' theorem]] implies

:<math>\\int_M (\\operatorname{div} X)\\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega,</math>

which is a generalization of the [[divergence theorem]].

The [[solenoidal]] vector fields are those with {{nowrap|1=div ''X'' = 0}}.  It follows from the definition of the Lie derivative that the volume form is preserved under the [[vector flow|flow]] of a solenoidal vector field.  Thus solenoidal vector fields are precisely those that have volume-preserving flows.  This fact is well-known, for instance, in [[fluid mechanics]] where the divergence of a velocity field measures the compressibility of a fluid, which in turn represents the extent to which volume is preserved along flows of the fluid.

==Special cases==

=== Lie groups ===

For any [[Lie group]], a natural volume form may be defined by translation.  That is, if ''ω''<sub>''e''</sub> is an element of <math>{\\textstyle\\bigwedge}^n T_e^*G</math>, then a left-invariant form may be defined by <math>\\omega_g=L_{g^{-1}}^*\\omega_e</math>, where ''L''<sub>''g''</sub> is left-translation.  As a corollary, every Lie group is orientable.  This volume form is unique up to a scalar, and the corresponding measure is known as the [[Haar measure]].

=== Symplectic manifolds ===

Any [[symplectic manifold]] (or indeed any [[almost symplectic manifold]]) has a natural volume form.  If ''M'' is a 2''n''-dimensional manifold with [[symplectic form]] ''ω'', then ''ω''<sup>''n''</sup> is nowhere zero as a consequence of the [[nondegeneracy]] of the symplectic form.  As a corollary, any symplectic manifold is orientable (indeed, oriented).  If the manifold is both symplectic and Riemannian, then the two volume forms agree if the manifold is [[Kähler manifold|Kähler]].

=== Riemannian volume form ===

Any [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] (including [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]]) [[manifold]] has a natural volume form.  In [[local coordinates]], it can be expressed as
:<math>\\omega = \\sqrt{|g|} dx^1\\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n</math>
where the <math>dx^i</math> are [[1-form]]s that form a positively oriented basis for the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold.  Here, <math>|g|</math> is the absolute value of the [[determinant]] of the matrix representation of the [[metric tensor]] on the manifold.

The volume form is denoted variously by

:<math>\\omega = \\mathrm{vol}_n = \\varepsilon = {\\star}(1) .</math>

Here, the <math>{\\star}</math> is the [[Hodge star]], thus the last form, <math>{\\star} (1)</math>, emphasizes that the volume form is the Hodge dual of the constant map on the manifold, which equals the [[Levi-Civita tensor|Levi-Civita ''tensor'']] ''ε''.

Although the Greek letter ''ω'' is frequently used to denote the volume form, this notation is not universal; the symbol ''ω'' often carries many other meanings in [[differential geometry]] (such as a symplectic form).

==Invariants of a volume form==
Volume forms are not unique; they form a [[torsor]] over non-vanishing functions on the manifold, as follows. Given a non-vanishing function ''f'' on ''M'', and a volume form <math>\\omega</math>, 
<math>f\\omega</math> is a volume form on ''M''. Conversely, given two volume forms <math>\\omega, \\omega'</math>, their ratio is a non-vanishing function (positive if they define the same orientation, negative if they define opposite orientations).

In coordinates, they are both simply a non-zero function times [[Lebesgue measure]], and their ratio is the ratio of the functions, which is independent of choice of coordinates. Intrinsically, it is the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem#Radon.E2.80.93Nikodym derivative|Radon–Nikodym derivative]] of <math>\\omega'</math> with respect to <math>\\omega</math>.  On an oriented manifold, the proportionality of any two volume forms can be thought of as a geometric form of the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem]].

===No local structure===
A volume form on a manifold has no local structure in the sense that it is not possible on small open sets to distinguish between the given volume form and the volume form on Euclidean space {{harv|Kobayashi|1972}}.  That is, for every point ''p'' in ''M'', there is an open neighborhood ''U'' of ''p'' and a [[diffeomorphism]] ''&phi;'' of ''U'' onto an open set in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> such that the volume form on ''U'' is the [[pullback]] of <math>dx^1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^n</math> along ''&phi;''.

As a corollary, if ''M'' and ''N'' are two manifolds, each with volume forms <math>\\omega_M, \\omega_N</math>, then for any points <math>m\\in M, n\\in N</math>, there are open neighborhoods ''U'' of ''m'' and ''V'' of ''n'' and a map <math>f\\colon U \\to V</math> such that the volume form on ''N'' restricted to the neighborhood ''V'' pulls back to volume form on ''M'' restricted to the neighborhood ''U'': <math>f^*\\omega_N\\vert_V = \\omega_M\\vert_U</math>.

In one dimension, one can prove it thus:
given a volume form <math>\\omega</math> on <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>, define
:<math>f(x) := \\int_0^x \\omega.</math>
Then the standard [[Lebesgue measure]] <math>dx</math> [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pulls back]] to <math>\\omega</math> under ''f'': <math>\\omega = f^*dx</math>. Concretely, <math>\\omega = f'\\,dx</math>.  In higher dimensions, given any point <math>m \\in M</math>, it has a neighborhood locally homeomorphic to <math>\\mathbf{R}\\times\\mathbf{R}^{n-1}</math>, and one can apply the same procedure.

===Global structure: volume===
A volume form on a connected manifold ''M'' has a single global invariant, namely the (overall) volume (denoted <math>\\mu(M)</math>), which is invariant under volume-form preserving maps; this may be infinite, such as for Lebesgue measure on <math>\\mathbf{R}^n</math>. On a disconnected manifold, the volume of each connected component is the invariant.

In symbols, if <math>f\\colon M \\to N</math> is a homeomorphism of manifolds that pulls back <math>\\omega_N</math> to <math>\\omega_M</math>, then

: <math>\\mu(N)=\\int_N \\omega_N = \\int_{f(M)} \\omega_N = \\int_M f^*\\omega_N = \\int_M \\omega_M=\\mu(M)\\,</math>

and the manifolds have the same volume.

Volume forms can also be pulled back under [[covering map]]s, in which case they multiply volume by the cardinality of the fiber (formally, by integration along the fiber). In the case of an infinite sheeted cover (such as <math>\\mathbf{R} \\to S^1</math>), a volume form on a finite volume manifold pulls back to a volume form on an infinite volume manifold.

[[Category:Determinants]]","In [[mathematics]], a '''volume form''' on a [[differentiable manifold]] is a top-dimensional form (i.e., a [[differential form]] of top degree).   Thus on a manifold ''M'' of dimension ''n'', a volume form is an ''n''-form, a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[line bundle]] {{nowrap|1=Ω<sup>''n''</sup>(''M'') = ⋀<sup>''n''</sup>(''T''<sup>∗</sup>''M'')}}.

:<math>(\\operatorname{div} X)\\omega = L_X\\omega = d(X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega) ,</math>

where ''L''<sub>''X''</sub> denotes the [[Lie derivative]] along ''X'' and <math>X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega</math> denotes the [[interior product]] or the left [[tensor contraction|contraction]] of ''ω'' along ''X''. If ''X'' is a [[compact support|compactly supported]] vector field and ''M'' is a [[manifold with boundary]], then [[Stokes' theorem]] implies

:<math>\\int_M (\\operatorname{div} X)\\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega,</math>

which is a generalization of the [[divergence theorem]].

The [[solenoidal]] vector fields are those with {{nowrap|1=div ''X'' = 0}}.  It follows from the definition of the Lie derivative that the volume form is preserved under the [[vector flow|flow]] of a solenoidal vector field.  Thus solenoidal vector fields are precisely those that have volume-preserving flows.  This fact is well-known, for instance, in [[fluid mechanics]] where the divergence of a velocity field measures the compressibility of a fluid, which in turn represents the extent to which volume is preserved along flows of the fluid.

==Special cases==

=== Lie groups ===

For any [[Lie group]], a natural volume form may be defined by translation.  That is, if ''ω''<sub>''e''</sub> is an element of <math>{\\textstyle\\bigwedge}^n T_e^*G</math>, then a left-invariant form may be defined by <math>\\omega_g=L_{g^{-1}}^*\\omega_e</math>, where ''L''<sub>''g''</sub> is left-translation.  As a corollary, every Lie group is orientable.  This volume form is unique up to a scalar, and the corresponding measure is known as the [[Haar measure]].

=== Symplectic manifolds ===

Any [[symplectic manifold]] (or indeed any [[almost symplectic manifold]]) has a natural volume form.  If ''M'' is a 2''n''-dimensional manifold with [[symplectic form]] ''ω'', then ''ω''<sup>''n''</sup> is nowhere zero as a consequence of the [[nondegeneracy]] of the symplectic form.  As a corollary, any symplectic manifold is orientable (indeed, oriented).  If the manifold is both symplectic and Riemannian, then the two volume forms agree if the manifold is [[Kähler manifold|Kähler]].

=== Riemannian volume form ===

Any [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] (including [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]]) [[manifold]] has a natural volume form.  In [[local coordinates]], it can be expressed as
:<math>\\omega = \\sqrt{|g|} dx^1\\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n</math>
where the <math>dx^i</math> are [[1-form]]s that form a positively oriented basis for the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold.  Here, <math>|g|</math> is the absolute value of the [[determinant]] of the matrix representation of the [[metric tensor]] on the manifold.

The volume form is denoted variously by

:<math>\\omega = \\mathrm{vol}_n = \\varepsilon = {\\star}(1) .</math>

Here, the <math>{\\star}</math> is the [[Hodge star]], thus the last form, <math>{\\star} (1)</math>, emphasizes that the volume form is the Hodge dual of the constant map on the manifold, which equals the [[Levi-Civita tensor|Levi-Civita ''tensor'']] ''ε''.

Although the Greek letter ''ω'' is frequently used to denote the volume form, this notation is not universal; the symbol ''ω'' often carries many other meanings in [[differential geometry]] (such as a symplectic form).

==Invariants of a volume form==
Volume forms are not unique; they form a [[torsor]] over non-vanishing functions on the manifold, as follows. Given a non-vanishing function ''f'' on ''M'', and a volume form <math>\\omega</math>, 
<math>f\\omega</math> is a volume form on ''M''. Conversely, given two volume forms <math>\\omega, \\omega'</math>, their ratio is a non-vanishing function (positive if they define the same orientation, negative if they define opposite orientations).

In coordinates, they are both simply a non-zero function times [[Lebesgue measure]], and their ratio is the ratio of the functions, which is independent of choice of coordinates. Intrinsically, it is the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem#Radon.E2.80.93Nikodym derivative|Radon–Nikodym derivative]] of <math>\\omega'</math> with respect to <math>\\omega</math>.  On an oriented manifold, the proportionality of any two volume forms can be thought of as a geometric form of the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem]].

===No local structure===
A volume form on a manifold has no local structure in the sense that it is not possible on small open sets to distinguish between the given volume form and the volume form on Euclidean space {{harv|Kobayashi|1972}}.  That is, for every point ''p'' in ''M'', there is an open neighborhood ''U'' of ''p'' and a [[diffeomorphism]] ''&phi;'' of ''U'' onto an open set in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> such that the volume form on ''U'' is the [[pullback]] of <math>dx^1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^n</math> along ''&phi;''.

As a corollary, if ''M'' and ''N'' are two manifolds, each with volume forms <math>\\omega_M, \\omega_N</math>, then for any points <math>m\\in M, n\\in N</math>, there are open neighborhoods ''U'' of ''m'' and ''V'' of ''n'' and a map <math>f\\colon U \\to V</math> such that the volume form on ''N'' restricted to the neighborhood ''V'' pulls back to volume form on ''M'' restricted to the neighborhood ''U'': <math>f^*\\omega_N\\vert_V = \\omega_M\\vert_U</math>.

In one dimension, one can prove it thus:
given a volume form <math>\\omega</math> on <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>, define
:<math>f(x) := \\int_0^x \\omega.</math>
Then the standard [[Lebesgue measure]] <math>dx</math> [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pulls back]] to <math>\\omega</math> under ''f'': <math>\\omega = f^*dx</math>. Concretely, <math>\\omega = f'\\,dx</math>.  In higher dimensions, given any point <math>m \\in M</math>, it has a neighborhood locally homeomorphic to <math>\\mathbf{R}\\times\\mathbf{R}^{n-1}</math>, and one can apply the same procedure.

===Global structure: volume===
A volume form on a connected manifold ''M'' has a single global invariant, namely the (overall) volume (denoted <math>\\mu(M)</math>), which is invariant under volume-form preserving maps; this may be infinite, such as for Lebesgue measure on <math>\\mathbf{R}^n</math>. On a disconnected manifold, the volume of each connected component is the invariant.

In symbols, if <math>f\\colon M \\to N</math> is a homeomorphism of manifolds that pulls back <math>\\omega_N</math> to <math>\\omega_M</math>, then

: <math>\\mu(N)=\\int_N \\omega_N = \\int_{f(M)} \\omega_N = \\int_M f^*\\omega_N = \\int_M \\omega_M=\\mu(M)\\,</math>

and the manifolds have the same volume.

Volume forms can also be pulled back under [[covering map]]s, in which case they multiply volume by the cardinality of the fiber (formally, by integration along the fiber). In the case of an infinite sheeted cover (such as <math>\\mathbf{R} \\to S^1</math>), a volume form on a finite volume manifold pulls back to a volume form on an infinite volume manifold.

'''Hunza''' ({{lang-bsk|ہنزو}}, [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]]: \"{{lang|wbl|shina}}\", {{lang-ur|{{nq|ہنزہ}}}}) is a mountainous valley in the [[Gilgit-Baltistan|Gilgit-Baltistan region]] of [[Pakistan]]. Hunza is situated in the extreme northern part of Pakistan, bordering with the [[Wakhan Corridor]] of [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang region]] of [[China]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Mountainous Valley situated in extreme northern part of Pakistan |url=https://www.dreamstime.com/hunza-mountainous-valley-gilgit-baltistan-region-pakistan-hunza-situated-extreme-northern-part-image107691385 |website=www.dreamstime.com |accessdate=3 June 2018}}</ref>

The Hunza valley is situated at an elevation of 2,438 meters (7,999 feet).  Geographicaly, Hunza consists of three regions, Upper Hunza ([[Gojal]]), Central Hunza (\"Hunza Valley\") and Lower Hunza (\"Shinaki\"). 

== History ==
{{main|State of Hunza}}
[[File: Baltit Fort, Karimabad, Hunza, Gilgit Baltistan.jpg|thumb|[[Baltit Fort]], the former residence of the Mirs of Hunza]]
Hunza was formerly a [[princely state]] bordering  [[Xinjiang]] (autonomous region of China) to the northeast and [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] to the northwest, which survived until 1974, when it was finally dissolved by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]].  The state bordered the [[Gilgit Agency]] to the south and the former princely state of [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] to the east. The state capital was the town of Baltit (also known as [[Karimabad (Hunza)|Karimabad]]); another old settlement is [[Ganish Village]] which means \"ancient gold\" village. Hunza was an independent principality for more than 900 years until the [[British Raj|British]] gained control of it and the neighboring valley of Nagar between 1889 and 1891 through military conquest. The then [[Tham (title)|Mir/Tham]] (ruler), branch of [[Katoor Dynasty|Katur Dynasty]], Safdar Khan of Hunza fled to [[Kashghar]] in China and sought what would now be called political asylum.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Valley|first1=Hunza|title=Hunza Valley|url=http://www.skardu.pk/hunza-valley/|website=www.skardu.pk|publisher=Skardu.pk|accessdate=23 November 2016}}</ref>

===Mir/Tham===
{{main|Mir of Hunza}}

An account wrote by John Biddulph in his book ''[[Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh]]'' {{cquote|The ruling family of Hunza is called Ayesha (heavenly). The two states of [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] and [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] were formerly one, ruled by a branch of the Shahreis, the ruling family of [[Gilgit]], whose seat of government was Nager. First muslim came to Hunza-Nagar Valley some 1000 years (At the time of Imam Islām Shāh 30th Imam Ismaili Muslims). After the introduction of [[Islam]] to Gilgit, married a daughter of Trakhan of [[Gilgit]], who bore him twin sons, named Moghlot and Girkis. From the former, the present ruling family of Nager is descended. The twins are said to have shown hostility to one another from birth. Thereupon their father, unable to settle the question of succession, divided his state between them, giving Girkis the north/west, and to Moghlot the south/east bank of the river.<ref>Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh by John Biddulph page 26</ref>}}

===2018 Rescue mission===
[[File:Hunza Tunnel.jpg|thumb|right|Tunnel]]
On 1 July 2018, [[Pakistan Army]] pilots in a daring mission rescued 3 foreign mountaineers stuck in snow avalanche at above the height of {{Convert|19000|ft}} on [[Ultar Sar|Ultar Sar Peak]] near Hunza. The perilous weather conditions had made it difficult for the Army helicopter to go forth with a rescue operation on the {{Convert|7,388|m}} high [[Ultar Sar]]. But they completed it. Bruce Normand and Timothy Miller from [[United Kingdom|UK]] successfully rescued alive while their companion Christian Huber from [[Austria]] had succumbed to avalanche.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pakistan Army Pilots rescued 3 foreign mountaineers |url=https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/headline/pakistan-army-rescues-avalanche-stricken-british-mountaineers-in-hunza-valley/ |website=en.dailypakistan.com.pk |accessdate=7 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mountainers News on Thenews.com.pk |url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/336019-pakistan-army-rescues-two-british-mountaineers-stranded-on |website=www.thenews.com.pk |accessdate=7 July 2018}}</ref>

Britain's High Commissioner [[Thomas Drew (diplomat)|Thomas Drew]] in [[Pakistan]] termed the mission “remarkable and dangerous” and said:

== People ==
{{main|Hunza people}}
The local languages spoken include [[Burushaski]], [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]] and [[Shina language|Shina]]. The literacy rate of the Hunza valley is more than 95%.<ref name=\"education dawn\">{{cite news|url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/29975|title=Hunza disaster and schools|first=Shahid|last=Siddiqui|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|accessdate=6 July 2012}}</ref> The historical area of Hunza and present northern Pakistan has had, over the centuries, mass migrations, conflicts and resettling of tribes and ethnicities, of which the [[Shina people|Dardic Shina]] race is the most prominent in regional history. People of the region have recounted their historical traditions down the generations. The Hunza Valley is also home to some [[Wakhi people|Wakhi]], who migrated there from northeastern Afghanistan beginning in the nineteenth century onwards.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Arts and Crafts of the Hunza Valley in Pakistan: Living Traditions in the Karakoram|last=Frembgen Wasim|first=Jurgen|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0-19-940520-6|location=Karachi|pages=1}}</ref>

{{main|State of Hunza}}
[[File: Baltit Fort, Karimabad, Hunza, Gilgit Baltistan.jpg|thumb|[[Baltit Fort]], the former residence of the Mirs of Hunza]]
Hunza was formerly a [[princely state]] bordering  [[Xinjiang]] (autonomous region of China) to the northeast and [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] to the northwest, which survived until 1974, when it was finally dissolved by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]].  The state bordered the [[Gilgit Agency]] to the south and the former princely state of [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] to the east. The state capital was the town of Baltit (also known as [[Karimabad (Hunza)|Karimabad]]); another old settlement is [[Ganish Village]] which means \"ancient gold\" village. Hunza was an independent principality for more than 900 years until the [[British Raj|British]] gained control of it and the neighboring valley of Nagar between 1889 and 1891 through military conquest. The then [[Tham (title)|Mir/Tham]] (ruler), branch of [[Katoor Dynasty|Katur Dynasty]], Safdar Khan of Hunza fled to [[Kashghar]] in China and sought what would now be called political asylum.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Valley|first1=Hunza|title=Hunza Valley|url=http://www.skardu.pk/hunza-valley/|website=www.skardu.pk|publisher=Skardu.pk|accessdate=23 November 2016}}</ref>

An account wrote by John Biddulph in his book ''[[Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh]]'' {{cquote|The ruling family of Hunza is called Ayesha (heavenly). The two states of [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] and [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] were formerly one, ruled by a branch of the Shahreis, the ruling family of [[Gilgit]], whose seat of government was Nager. First muslim came to Hunza-Nagar Valley some 1000 years (At the time of Imam Islām Shāh 30th Imam Ismaili Muslims). After the introduction of [[Islam]] to Gilgit, married a daughter of Trakhan of [[Gilgit]], who bore him twin sons, named Moghlot and Girkis. From the former, the present ruling family of Nager is descended. The twins are said to have shown hostility to one another from birth. Thereupon their father, unable to settle the question of succession, divided his state between them, giving Girkis the north/west, and to Moghlot the south/east bank of the river.<ref>Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh by John Biddulph page 26</ref>}}

'''Hunza''' ({{lang-bsk|ہنزو}}, [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]]: \"{{lang|wbl|shina}}\", {{lang-ur|{{nq|ہنزہ}}}}) is a mountainous valley in the [[Gilgit-Baltistan|Gilgit-Baltistan region]] of [[Pakistan]]. Hunza is situated in the extreme northern part of Pakistan, bordering with the [[Wakhan Corridor]] of [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang region]] of [[China]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Mountainous Valley situated in extreme northern part of Pakistan |url=https://www.dreamstime.com/hunza-mountainous-valley-gilgit-baltistan-region-pakistan-hunza-situated-extreme-northern-part-image107691385 |website=www.dreamstime.com |accessdate=3 June 2018}}</ref>

The Hunza valley is situated at an elevation of 2,438 meters (7,999 feet).  Geographicaly, Hunza consists of three regions, Upper Hunza ([[Gojal]]), Central Hunza (\"Hunza Valley\") and Lower Hunza (\"Shinaki\"). 

== History ==
{{main|State of Hunza}}
[[File: Baltit Fort, Karimabad, Hunza, Gilgit Baltistan.jpg|thumb|[[Baltit Fort]], the former residence of the Mirs of Hunza]]
Hunza was formerly a [[princely state]] bordering  [[Xinjiang]] (autonomous region of China) to the northeast and [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] to the northwest, which survived until 1974, when it was finally dissolved by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]].  The state bordered the [[Gilgit Agency]] to the south and the former princely state of [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] to the east. The state capital was the town of Baltit (also known as [[Karimabad (Hunza)|Karimabad]]); another old settlement is [[Ganish Village]] which means \"ancient gold\" village. Hunza was an independent principality for more than 900 years until the [[British Raj|British]] gained control of it and the neighboring valley of Nagar between 1889 and 1891 through military conquest. The then [[Tham (title)|Mir/Tham]] (ruler), branch of [[Katoor Dynasty|Katur Dynasty]], Safdar Khan of Hunza fled to [[Kashghar]] in China and sought what would now be called political asylum.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Valley|first1=Hunza|title=Hunza Valley|url=http://www.skardu.pk/hunza-valley/|website=www.skardu.pk|publisher=Skardu.pk|accessdate=23 November 2016}}</ref>

===Mir/Tham===
{{main|Mir of Hunza}}

An account wrote by John Biddulph in his book ''[[Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh]]'' {{cquote|The ruling family of Hunza is called Ayesha (heavenly). The two states of [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] and [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] were formerly one, ruled by a branch of the Shahreis, the ruling family of [[Gilgit]], whose seat of government was Nager. First muslim came to Hunza-Nagar Valley some 1000 years (At the time of Imam Islām Shāh 30th Imam Ismaili Muslims). After the introduction of [[Islam]] to Gilgit, married a daughter of Trakhan of [[Gilgit]], who bore him twin sons, named Moghlot and Girkis. From the former, the present ruling family of Nager is descended. The twins are said to have shown hostility to one another from birth. Thereupon their father, unable to settle the question of succession, divided his state between them, giving Girkis the north/west, and to Moghlot the south/east bank of the river.<ref>Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh by John Biddulph page 26</ref>}}

===2010 landslide===
In 2010, a landslide blocked the river and created [[Attabad Lake]] (also called shishket Lake), resulting in 20 deaths and 8 injuries and has effectively blocked about {{convert|26|km}} of the [[Karakoram Highway]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waheed |first1=Abdul |title=The Attabad Landslide Disaster |url=https://pamirtimes.net/2013/01/04/the-attabad-landslide-disaster/ |accessdate=12 October 2019 |publisher=Pamir Times |date=4 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=SHISHKET LAKE CRISES – 2010 – CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS |url=http://www.ndma.gov.pk/new/aboutus/SHISHKET_lake_2010.pdf |website=ndma.gov.pk |publisher=[[National Disaster Management Authority (Pakistan)|NDMA]] |accessdate=12 October 2019 |date=27 July 2010}}</ref> The new lake extends {{convert|30|km|mi}} and rose to a depth of {{convert|400|ft|m}} when it was formed as the Hunza River backed up.<ref name=\"fourworlds_HiMaT_2013\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fourworlds.ca/documents/ASecondGreenRevolution.pdf | title=Needed: a second green revolution in Hunza | publisher=HiMaT | date=May 2013 | accessdate=26 November 2015 | pages=4 | author1=Michael Bopp | author2=Judie Bopp}} Karakorum Area Development Organization (KADO), Aliabad</ref> The landslide completely covered sections of the Karakoram Highway.<ref name=\"fourworlds_HiMaT_2013\" />

===2018 Rescue mission===
[[File:Hunza Tunnel.jpg|thumb|right|Tunnel]]
On 1 July 2018, [[Pakistan Army]] pilots in a daring mission rescued 3 foreign mountaineers stuck in snow avalanche at above the height of {{Convert|19000|ft}} on [[Ultar Sar|Ultar Sar Peak]] near Hunza. The perilous weather conditions had made it difficult for the Army helicopter to go forth with a rescue operation on the {{Convert|7,388|m}} high [[Ultar Sar]]. But they completed it. Bruce Normand and Timothy Miller from [[United Kingdom|UK]] successfully rescued alive while their companion Christian Huber from [[Austria]] had succumbed to avalanche.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pakistan Army Pilots rescued 3 foreign mountaineers |url=https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/headline/pakistan-army-rescues-avalanche-stricken-british-mountaineers-in-hunza-valley/ |website=en.dailypakistan.com.pk |accessdate=7 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mountainers News on Thenews.com.pk |url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/336019-pakistan-army-rescues-two-british-mountaineers-stranded-on |website=www.thenews.com.pk |accessdate=7 July 2018}}</ref>

Britain's High Commissioner [[Thomas Drew (diplomat)|Thomas Drew]] in [[Pakistan]] termed the mission “remarkable and dangerous” and said:

“''Our gratitude to the [[Pakistan Army]] pilots who rescued two British climbers trapped by an avalanche on [[Ultar Sar|Ultar Sar Peak]] near Hunza. Our thoughts with their Austrian fellow climber who died”''.

== People ==
{{main|Hunza people}}
The local languages spoken include [[Burushaski]], [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]] and [[Shina language|Shina]]. The literacy rate of the Hunza valley is more than 77%.<ref name=\"education dawn\">{{cite news|url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/29975|title=Hunza disaster and schools|first=Shahid|last=Siddiqui|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|accessdate=6 July 2012}}</ref> The historical area of Hunza and present northern Pakistan has had, over the centuries, mass migrations, conflicts and resettling of tribes and ethnicities, of which the [[Shina people|Dardic Shina]] race is the most prominent in regional history. People of the region have recounted their historical traditions down the generations. The Hunza Valley is also home to some [[Wakhi people|Wakhi]], who migrated there from northeastern Afghanistan beginning in the nineteenth century onwards.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Arts and Crafts of the Hunza Valley in Pakistan: Living Traditions in the Karakoram|last=Frembgen Wasim|first=Jurgen|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0-19-940520-6|location=Karachi|pages=1}}</ref>

The longevity of Hunza people has been noted by some,<ref name=\"Wrench1938\">{{Cite book |year=1938 |author=Wrench, Dr Guy T |title=The Wheel of Health: A Study of the Hunza People and the Keys to Health |series=2009 reprint |place= |publisher=Review Press |isbn=978-0-9802976-6-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lMfSuHgabYoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=wheel+of+health#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=12 August 2010 }}</ref> but others refute this as a [[Longevity myths|longevity myth]] and cite a life expectancy of 110 years for men and 122 for women with a high standard deviation.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E2D9173CF93AA1575AC0A960958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | title=The Optimists Are Right | first=John | last=Tierney | date=29 September 1996}}</ref> There is no evidence that Hunza life expectancy is significantly above the average of poor, isolated regions of Pakistan. Claims of health and long life were almost always based solely on the statements by the local mir (king).

'''Hendon Football Club''' is a [[semi-professional]] [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]] in the [[London Borough of Brent]]. They are currently members of the {{English football updater|Hendon}} and play at Silver Jubilee Park in [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]].

==History==
The club was established as Christchurch Hampstead in 1908. They joined the Third Division of the Finchley & District League, which they won at the first attempt, earning promotion to Division Two.<ref name=H>[http://www.hendonfc.net/History History] Hendon F.C.</ref> At the start of the 1909–10 season the club were renamed Hampstead Town and they went on to win Division Two at the first attempt, earning promotion to Division One.<ref name=H/> For the 1911–12 season the club entered teams into both Division One of the Finchley & District League and Division Two of the London League.<ref name=H/><ref name=NLM1>[http://nonleaguematters.co.uk/nlmnet/Regmet/LoL10.html London League 1910–1928] Non-League Matters</ref> They won the Finchley & District League title, and a fourth-place finish in Division Two of the London League saw the club promoted to Division One.<ref name=H/><ref name=NLM1/> They subsequently entered a team into the Middlesex League alongside the London League team.

In 1912–13 Hampstead Town were runners-up in Division One of the London League, earning promotion to the Premier Division (Amateur);<ref name=NLM1/> they also won the Middlesex League.<ref name=Hon/> The following season saw them win both the Middlesex League and the Premier Division (Amateur) of the London League.<ref name=Hon/> This success saw the club admitted to the [[Athenian League]] for the 1914–15 season.<ref name=NLM1/><ref name=FCHD1>{{fchd|id=HAMPSTET|name=Hampstead Town}}</ref> However, the league was abandoned after two games due to [[World War I]]. After the war they played in the [[United Senior League]] in the 1918–19 season and won the league,<ref>[http://www.historicaldons.com/index.php?od=5&yd=1912 1918–19] Historical Dons</ref> before returning to the Athenian League when it restarted in 1919. The club was renamed Hampstead in 1926.<ref name=FCHD1/> They were Athenian League runners-up in 1928–29 and again in 1932–33, before being renamed Golders Green in 1933.<ref name=FCHD2>{{fchd|id=HAMPSTEA|name=Hampstead}}</ref> They reached the first round of the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in [[1934–35 FA Cup|1934–35]], losing 10–1 at [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]].<ref name=FCHD2/> In 1946 the club was renamed again, adopting its current name,<ref name=FCHD2/> that of [[Hendon F.C.

Hendon were Athenian League runners-up in 1947–48, 1948–49 and 1951–52 before winning their first Athenian League title in 1952–53, a season which also saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 2–0 at [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] in a replay.<ref name=FCHD3>{{fchd|id=HENDON|name=Hendon}}</ref> In 1954–55 they reached the final of the [[FA Amateur Cup]], losing 2–0 to [[Bishop Auckland F.C.|Bishop Auckland]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].<ref name=FCHD3/> They went on to win the Athenian League title again in 1955–56, also reaching the second round of the FA Cup, beating [[Halesowen Town F.C.|Halesowen Town]] 4–2 in the first round before losing 6–2 at [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] in the second.<ref name=FCHD3/> The club won their first Amateur Cup in 1959–60, defeating [[Kingstonian F.C.|Kingstonian]] 2–1 in the final. A third Athenian League title was won in 1960–61.<ref name=FCHD3/> In 1963 the club switched to the [[Isthmian League]]. They were runners-up in their [[1963–64 Isthmian League|first season]] in the league. In their second season, [[1964–65 Isthmian League|1964–65]], the club won the Isthmian League and Amateur Cup double, defeating [[Whitby Town F.C.|Whitby Town]] 3–1 in the final.

Hendon reached the final of the FA Amateur Cup again the following season, but lost 3–1 to [[Wealdstone F.C.|Wealdstone]]. After winning their third Amateur Cup with a 2–0 win against [[Enfield F.C.|Enfield]] in 1971–72, a second Isthmian League title was won in [[1972–73 Isthmian League|1972–73]]. The [[1973–74 FA Cup|following season]] they reached the third round of the [[FA Cup]], where they drew [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]; after holding them to a 1–1 draw at [[St James' Park]], Hendon lost 4–0 in a replay played at [[Watford F.C.|Watford's]] [[Vicarage Road]].<ref name=FCHD3/> In [[1975–76 FA Cup|1975–76]] the club defeated a [[English Football League|Football League]] club for the first time, beating [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] 1–0 in the first round, before losing to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in the second round.<ref name=FCHD3/>

→‎Orientation:adjusting appearance of notation from old italicized to more readable TeX,safe,Phokoro,"In [[mathematics]], a '''volume form''' on a [[differentiable manifold]] is a top-dimensional form (i.e., a [[differential form]] of top degree).   Thus on a manifold ''M'' of dimension ''n'', a volume form is an ''n''-form, a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[line bundle]] {{nowrap|1=Ω<sup>''n''</sup>(''M'') = ⋀<sup>''n''</sup>(''T''<sup>∗</sup>''M'')}}.  A manifold admits a nowhere-vanishing volume form if and only if it is orientable. An [[orientable manifold]] has infinitely many volume forms, since multiplying a volume form by a function yields another volume form. On non-orientable manifolds, one may instead define the weaker notion of a [[Density on a manifold|density]].

A volume form provides a means to define the [[integral]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] on a differentiable manifold.  In other words, a volume form gives rise to a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] with respect to which functions can be integrated by the appropriate [[Lebesgue integral]].  The absolute value of a volume form is a [[volume element]], which is also known variously as a ''twisted volume form'' or ''pseudo-volume form''.  It also defines a measure, but exists on any differentiable manifold, orientable or not.

[[Kähler manifold]]s, being [[complex manifold]]s, are naturally oriented, and so possess a volume form.  More generally, the ''n''th [[exterior power]] of the symplectic form on a [[symplectic manifold]] is a volume form. Many classes of manifolds have canonical volume forms: they have extra structure which allows the choice of a preferred volume form.  Oriented [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s have an associated canonical volume form.

== Orientation ==
A manifold is [[orientable]] if it has a [[coordinate atlas]] all of whose transition functions have positive [[Jacobian determinant]]s.  A selection of a maximal such atlas is an orientation on <math>M</math>.  A volume form <math>\\omega</math> on <math>M</math> gives rise to an orientation in a natural way as the atlas of coordinate charts on <math>M</math> that send <math>\\omega</math> to a positive multiple of the Euclidean volume form <math>dx^1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^n</math>.

A volume form also allows for the specification of a preferred class of [[moving frame|frames]] on <math>M</math>. Call a basis of tangent vectors <math>(X_1, \\ldots, X_n)</math> right-handed if

:<math>\\omega(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n) > 0.</math>

The collection of all right-handed frames is [[Group action (mathematics)|acted upon]] by the [[group (mathematics)|group]] <math>GL^+(n)</math> of [[general linear group|general linear]] mappings in <math>n</math> dimensions with positive determinant.  They form a [[principal bundle|principal <math>GL^+(n)</math> sub-bundle]] of the [[linear frame bundle]] of <math>M</math>, and so the orientation associated to a volume form gives a canonical reduction of the frame bundle of <math>M</math> to a sub-bundle with structure group <math>GL^+(n)</math>.  That is to say that a volume form gives rise to [[G-structure|<math>GL^+(n)</math>-structure]] on <math>M</math>.  More reduction is clearly possible by considering frames that have

{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\omega(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n) = 1.</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Thus a volume form gives rise to an <math>SL(n)</math>-structure as well.  Conversely, given an <math>SL(n)</math>-structure, one can recover a volume form by imposing ({{EquationNote|1}}) for the special linear frames and then solving for the required <math>n</math>-form <math>\\omega</math> by requiring homogeneity in its arguments.

A manifold is orientable if and only if it has a volume form.  Indeed, <math>SL(n) \\to GL^+(n)</math> is a [[deformation retract]] since <math>GL^+ = SL \\times \\mathbb{R}^+</math>, where the [[positive reals]] are embedded as scalar matrices.  Thus every <math>GL^+(n)</math>-structure is reducible to an <math>SL(n)</math>-structure, and <math>GL^+(n)</math>-structures coincide with orientations on <math>M</math>.  More concretely, triviality of the determinant bundle <math>\\Omega^n(M)</math> is equivalent to orientability, and a line bundle is trivial if and only if it has a nowhere-vanishing section. Thus the existence of a volume form is equivalent to orientability.

== Relation to measures ==
{{See also|Density on a manifold}}
Given a volume form ''ω'' on an oriented manifold, the [[density on a manifold|density]] {{abs|''ω''}} is a volume [[pseudotensor|pseudo-form]] on the nonoriented manifold obtained by forgetting the orientation. Densities may also be defined more generally on non-orientable manifolds.

Any volume pseudo-form ''ω'' (and therefore also any volume form) defines a measure on the [[Borel set]]s by
:<math>\\mu_\\omega(U)=\\int_U\\omega .</math>

The difference is that while a measure can be integrated over a (Borel) ''subset'', a volume form can only be integrated over an ''oriented'' cell. In single variable [[calculus]], writing <math>\\int_b^a f\\,dx = -\\int_a^b f\\,dx</math> considers <math>dx</math> as a volume form, not simply a measure, and <math>\\int_b^a</math> indicates \"integrate over the cell <math>[a,b]</math> with the opposite orientation, sometimes denoted <math>\\overline{[a,b]}</math>\".

Further, general measures need not be continuous or smooth: they need not be defined by a volume form, or more formally, their [[Radon–Nikodym derivative]] with respect to a given volume form need not be [[absolutely continuous]].

==Divergence==
Given a volume form ''ω'' on ''M'', one can define the [[divergence]] of a [[vector field]] ''X'' as the unique scalar-valued function, denoted by div&nbsp;''X'', satisfying

:<math>(\\operatorname{div} X)\\omega = L_X\\omega = d(X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega) ,</math>

where ''L''<sub>''X''</sub> denotes the [[Lie derivative]] along ''X'' and <math>X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega</math> denotes the [[interior product]] or the left [[tensor contraction|contraction]] of ''ω'' along ''X''. If ''X'' is a [[compact support|compactly supported]] vector field and ''M'' is a [[manifold with boundary]], then [[Stokes' theorem]] implies

:<math>\\int_M (\\operatorname{div} X)\\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega,</math>

which is a generalization of the [[divergence theorem]].

The [[solenoidal]] vector fields are those with {{nowrap|1=div ''X'' = 0}}.  It follows from the definition of the Lie derivative that the volume form is preserved under the [[vector flow|flow]] of a solenoidal vector field.  Thus solenoidal vector fields are precisely those that have volume-preserving flows.  This fact is well-known, for instance, in [[fluid mechanics]] where the divergence of a velocity field measures the compressibility of a fluid, which in turn represents the extent to which volume is preserved along flows of the fluid.

==Special cases==

=== Lie groups ===

For any [[Lie group]], a natural volume form may be defined by translation.  That is, if ''ω''<sub>''e''</sub> is an element of <math>{\\textstyle\\bigwedge}^n T_e^*G</math>, then a left-invariant form may be defined by <math>\\omega_g=L_{g^{-1}}^*\\omega_e</math>, where ''L''<sub>''g''</sub> is left-translation.  As a corollary, every Lie group is orientable.  This volume form is unique up to a scalar, and the corresponding measure is known as the [[Haar measure]].

=== Symplectic manifolds ===

Any [[symplectic manifold]] (or indeed any [[almost symplectic manifold]]) has a natural volume form.  If ''M'' is a 2''n''-dimensional manifold with [[symplectic form]] ''ω'', then ''ω''<sup>''n''</sup> is nowhere zero as a consequence of the [[nondegeneracy]] of the symplectic form.  As a corollary, any symplectic manifold is orientable (indeed, oriented).  If the manifold is both symplectic and Riemannian, then the two volume forms agree if the manifold is [[Kähler manifold|Kähler]].

=== Riemannian volume form ===

Any [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] (including [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]]) [[manifold]] has a natural volume form.  In [[local coordinates]], it can be expressed as
:<math>\\omega = \\sqrt{|g|} dx^1\\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n</math>
where the <math>dx^i</math> are [[1-form]]s that form a positively oriented basis for the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold.  Here, <math>|g|</math> is the absolute value of the [[determinant]] of the matrix representation of the [[metric tensor]] on the manifold.

The volume form is denoted variously by

:<math>\\omega = \\mathrm{vol}_n = \\varepsilon = {\\star}(1) .</math>

Here, the <math>{\\star}</math> is the [[Hodge star]], thus the last form, <math>{\\star} (1)</math>, emphasizes that the volume form is the Hodge dual of the constant map on the manifold, which equals the [[Levi-Civita tensor|Levi-Civita ''tensor'']] ''ε''.

Although the Greek letter ''ω'' is frequently used to denote the volume form, this notation is not universal; the symbol ''ω'' often carries many other meanings in [[differential geometry]] (such as a symplectic form).

==Invariants of a volume form==
Volume forms are not unique; they form a [[torsor]] over non-vanishing functions on the manifold, as follows. Given a non-vanishing function ''f'' on ''M'', and a volume form <math>\\omega</math>, 
<math>f\\omega</math> is a volume form on ''M''. Conversely, given two volume forms <math>\\omega, \\omega'</math>, their ratio is a non-vanishing function (positive if they define the same orientation, negative if they define opposite orientations).

In coordinates, they are both simply a non-zero function times [[Lebesgue measure]], and their ratio is the ratio of the functions, which is independent of choice of coordinates. Intrinsically, it is the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem#Radon.E2.80.93Nikodym derivative|Radon–Nikodym derivative]] of <math>\\omega'</math> with respect to <math>\\omega</math>.  On an oriented manifold, the proportionality of any two volume forms can be thought of as a geometric form of the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem]].

===No local structure===
A volume form on a manifold has no local structure in the sense that it is not possible on small open sets to distinguish between the given volume form and the volume form on Euclidean space {{harv|Kobayashi|1972}}.  That is, for every point ''p'' in ''M'', there is an open neighborhood ''U'' of ''p'' and a [[diffeomorphism]] ''&phi;'' of ''U'' onto an open set in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> such that the volume form on ''U'' is the [[pullback]] of <math>dx^1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^n</math> along ''&phi;''.

As a corollary, if ''M'' and ''N'' are two manifolds, each with volume forms <math>\\omega_M, \\omega_N</math>, then for any points <math>m\\in M, n\\in N</math>, there are open neighborhoods ''U'' of ''m'' and ''V'' of ''n'' and a map <math>f\\colon U \\to V</math> such that the volume form on ''N'' restricted to the neighborhood ''V'' pulls back to volume form on ''M'' restricted to the neighborhood ''U'': <math>f^*\\omega_N\\vert_V = \\omega_M\\vert_U</math>.

In one dimension, one can prove it thus:
given a volume form <math>\\omega</math> on <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>, define
:<math>f(x) := \\int_0^x \\omega.</math>
Then the standard [[Lebesgue measure]] <math>dx</math> [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pulls back]] to <math>\\omega</math> under ''f'': <math>\\omega = f^*dx</math>. Concretely, <math>\\omega = f'\\,dx</math>.  In higher dimensions, given any point <math>m \\in M</math>, it has a neighborhood locally homeomorphic to <math>\\mathbf{R}\\times\\mathbf{R}^{n-1}</math>, and one can apply the same procedure.

===Global structure: volume===
A volume form on a connected manifold ''M'' has a single global invariant, namely the (overall) volume (denoted <math>\\mu(M)</math>), which is invariant under volume-form preserving maps; this may be infinite, such as for Lebesgue measure on <math>\\mathbf{R}^n</math>. On a disconnected manifold, the volume of each connected component is the invariant.

In symbols, if <math>f\\colon M \\to N</math> is a homeomorphism of manifolds that pulls back <math>\\omega_N</math> to <math>\\omega_M</math>, then

: <math>\\mu(N)=\\int_N \\omega_N = \\int_{f(M)} \\omega_N = \\int_M f^*\\omega_N = \\int_M \\omega_M=\\mu(M)\\,</math>

and the manifolds have the same volume.

Volume forms can also be pulled back under [[covering map]]s, in which case they multiply volume by the cardinality of the fiber (formally, by integration along the fiber). In the case of an infinite sheeted cover (such as <math>\\mathbf{R} \\to S^1</math>), a volume form on a finite volume manifold pulls back to a volume form on an infinite volume manifold.

[[Category:Integration on manifolds]]
[[Category:Differential forms]]
[[Category:Determinants]]","In [[mathematics]], a '''volume form''' on a [[differentiable manifold]] is a top-dimensional form (i.e., a [[differential form]] of top degree).   Thus on a manifold ''M'' of dimension ''n'', a volume form is an ''n''-form, a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[line bundle]] {{nowrap|1=Ω<sup>''n''</sup>(''M'') = ⋀<sup>''n''</sup>(''T''<sup>∗</sup>''M'')}}.  A manifold admits a nowhere-vanishing volume form if and only if it is orientable. An [[orientable manifold]] has infinitely many volume forms, since multiplying a volume form by a function yields another volume form. On non-orientable manifolds, one may instead define the weaker notion of a [[Density on a manifold|density]].

A volume form provides a means to define the [[integral]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] on a differentiable manifold.  In other words, a volume form gives rise to a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] with respect to which functions can be integrated by the appropriate [[Lebesgue integral]].  The absolute value of a volume form is a [[volume element]], which is also known variously as a ''twisted volume form'' or ''pseudo-volume form''.  It also defines a measure, but exists on any differentiable manifold, orientable or not.

[[Kähler manifold]]s, being [[complex manifold]]s, are naturally oriented, and so possess a volume form.  More generally, the ''n''th [[exterior power]] of the symplectic form on a [[symplectic manifold]] is a volume form. Many classes of manifolds have canonical volume forms: they have extra structure which allows the choice of a preferred volume form.  Oriented [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s have an associated canonical volume form.

== Orientation ==
A manifold is [[orientable]] if it has a [[coordinate atlas]] all of whose transition functions have positive [[Jacobian determinant]]s.  A selection of a maximal such atlas is an orientation on ''M''.  A volume form ''ω'' on ''M'' gives rise to an orientation in a natural way as the atlas of coordinate charts on ''M'' that send ''ω'' to a positive multiple of the Euclidean volume form <math>dx^1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^n</math>.

A volume form also allows for the specification of a preferred class of [[moving frame|frames]] on ''M''. Call a basis of tangent vectors (''X''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>) right-handed if

:<math>\\omega(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n) > 0.</math>

The collection of all right-handed frames is [[Group action (mathematics)|acted upon]] by the [[group (mathematics)|group]] GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'') of [[general linear group|general linear]] mappings in ''n'' dimensions with positive determinant.  They form a [[principal bundle|principal GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'') sub-bundle]] of the [[linear frame bundle]] of ''M'', and so the orientation associated to a volume form gives a canonical reduction of the frame bundle of ''M'' to a sub-bundle with structure group GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'').  That is to say that a volume form gives rise to [[G-structure|GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'')-structure]] on ''M''.  More reduction is clearly possible by considering frames that have

{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\omega(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n) = 1.</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Thus a volume form gives rise to an SL(''n'')-structure as well.  Conversely, given an SL(''n'')-structure, one can recover a volume form by imposing ({{EquationNote|1}}) for the special linear frames and then solving for the required ''n''-form ''ω'' by requiring homogeneity in its arguments.

A manifold is orientable if and only if it has a volume form.  Indeed, {{nowrap|SL(''n'') → GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'')}} is a [[deformation retract]] since {{nowrap|1=GL<sup>+</sup> = SL × '''R'''<sup>+</sup>}}, where the [[positive reals]] are embedded as scalar matrices.  Thus every GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'')-structure is reducible to an SL(''n'')-structure, and GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'')-structures coincide with orientations on ''M''.  More concretely, triviality of the determinant bundle <math>\\Omega^n(M)</math> is equivalent to orientability, and a line bundle is trivial if and only if it has a nowhere-vanishing section. Thus the existence of a volume form is equivalent to orientability.

== Relation to measures ==
{{See also|Density on a manifold}}
Given a volume form ''ω'' on an oriented manifold, the [[density on a manifold|density]] {{abs|''ω''}} is a volume [[pseudotensor|pseudo-form]] on the nonoriented manifold obtained by forgetting the orientation. Densities may also be defined more generally on non-orientable manifolds.

Any volume pseudo-form ''ω'' (and therefore also any volume form) defines a measure on the [[Borel set]]s by
:<math>\\mu_\\omega(U)=\\int_U\\omega .</math>

The difference is that while a measure can be integrated over a (Borel) ''subset'', a volume form can only be integrated over an ''oriented'' cell. In single variable [[calculus]], writing <math>\\int_b^a f\\,dx = -\\int_a^b f\\,dx</math> considers <math>dx</math> as a volume form, not simply a measure, and <math>\\int_b^a</math> indicates \"integrate over the cell <math>[a,b]</math> with the opposite orientation, sometimes denoted <math>\\overline{[a,b]}</math>\".

Further, general measures need not be continuous or smooth: they need not be defined by a volume form, or more formally, their [[Radon–Nikodym derivative]] with respect to a given volume form need not be [[absolutely continuous]].

==Divergence==
Given a volume form ''ω'' on ''M'', one can define the [[divergence]] of a [[vector field]] ''X'' as the unique scalar-valued function, denoted by div&nbsp;''X'', satisfying

:<math>(\\operatorname{div} X)\\omega = L_X\\omega = d(X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega) ,</math>

where ''L''<sub>''X''</sub> denotes the [[Lie derivative]] along ''X'' and <math>X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega</math> denotes the [[interior product]] or the left [[tensor contraction|contraction]] of ''ω'' along ''X''. If ''X'' is a [[compact support|compactly supported]] vector field and ''M'' is a [[manifold with boundary]], then [[Stokes' theorem]] implies

:<math>\\int_M (\\operatorname{div} X)\\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega,</math>

which is a generalization of the [[divergence theorem]].

The [[solenoidal]] vector fields are those with {{nowrap|1=div ''X'' = 0}}.  It follows from the definition of the Lie derivative that the volume form is preserved under the [[vector flow|flow]] of a solenoidal vector field.  Thus solenoidal vector fields are precisely those that have volume-preserving flows.  This fact is well-known, for instance, in [[fluid mechanics]] where the divergence of a velocity field measures the compressibility of a fluid, which in turn represents the extent to which volume is preserved along flows of the fluid.

==Special cases==

=== Lie groups ===

For any [[Lie group]], a natural volume form may be defined by translation.  That is, if ''ω''<sub>''e''</sub> is an element of <math>{\\textstyle\\bigwedge}^n T_e^*G</math>, then a left-invariant form may be defined by <math>\\omega_g=L_{g^{-1}}^*\\omega_e</math>, where ''L''<sub>''g''</sub> is left-translation.  As a corollary, every Lie group is orientable.  This volume form is unique up to a scalar, and the corresponding measure is known as the [[Haar measure]].

=== Symplectic manifolds ===

Any [[symplectic manifold]] (or indeed any [[almost symplectic manifold]]) has a natural volume form.  If ''M'' is a 2''n''-dimensional manifold with [[symplectic form]] ''ω'', then ''ω''<sup>''n''</sup> is nowhere zero as a consequence of the [[nondegeneracy]] of the symplectic form.  As a corollary, any symplectic manifold is orientable (indeed, oriented).  If the manifold is both symplectic and Riemannian, then the two volume forms agree if the manifold is [[Kähler manifold|Kähler]].

=== Riemannian volume form ===

Any [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] (including [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]]) [[manifold]] has a natural volume form.  In [[local coordinates]], it can be expressed as
:<math>\\omega = \\sqrt{|g|} dx^1\\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n</math>
where the <math>dx^i</math> are [[1-form]]s that form a positively oriented basis for the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold.  Here, <math>|g|</math> is the absolute value of the [[determinant]] of the matrix representation of the [[metric tensor]] on the manifold.

'''TANS Perú Flight 204''' refers to a domestic scheduled [[Lima]]–[[Pucallpa]]–[[Iquitos]] passenger service, operated with a [[Boeing 737-200 Advanced]], that crashed on 23 August 2005 on approach to [[Pucallpa Airport]], {{convert|4|mi}} off the airfield, following an [[emergency landing]] attempt because of bad weather, killing 40 of the 98 passengers and crew aboard.

==Aircraft and crew==
The aircraft involved was a 1981-built [[Boeing 737-200 Advanced|Boeing 737-244 Advanced]], [[Aircraft registration|registered]] OB-1809, which had been [[Aircraft lease|lease]]d to TANS Perú from the South African lessor company [[Safair]] two months prior to the accident.<ref name=\"TANS confirms 57 survivors in 737-200 crash\" /> With [[manufacturer's serial number]] 22580 and powered with two [[Pratt & Whitney JT8D|Pratt & Whitney JT8D-17A]] engines, the airframe had its maiden flight on 4 August 1981, and was originally delivered to [[South African Airways]].<ref name=\"ASN\">{{ASN accident|id= 20050823-0|accessdate= 16 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airfleets.net/ficheapp/plane-b737-22580.htm|title=TANS OB-1809-P aircraft history|last=|first=|date=|website=Airfleets.net|publisher=Airfleets aviation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref> At the time of the accident the aircraft had accumulated 49,865 flight hours and 45,262 cycles,<ref name=\"Final report\"/> and was {{Age|1981|8|4|2005|8|23}} years old.

The captain was 45-year-old Octavio Perez Palma Garreta, who had 5,867 flight hours, including 3,763 hours on the Boeing 737. The first officer was 37-year-old Jorge Luis Pinto Panta, who had 4,755 flight hours, with 1,109 of them on the Boeing 737. 38-year-old Gonzalo Chirinos Delgado, a trainee pilot, was also on board.

==Description of the accident==
There was an unusual developing [[cold front]] in the vicinity of Pucallpa, minutes before the event took place, with [[cloud top]]s estimated to be {{convert|45000|ft}} high.<ref name=\"Final report\"/> Instead of diverting to another airport, the crew initiated the approach to Pucallpa Airport with torrential rain, hail and strong winds.<ref name=\"58 walk away from Peruvian plane crash\"/> Some {{cardinal to word|10}} minutes before the scheduled time for landing the aircraft started rocking.<ref name=\"58 walk away from Peruvian plane crash\"/> Realising that the airport could not be safely reached amid the worsening weather conditions, the pilot attempted an emergency landing.

'''TANS Perú Flight 204''' refers to a domestic scheduled [[Lima]]–[[Pucallpa]]–[[Iquitos]] passenger service, operated with a [[Boeing 737-200 Advanced]], that crashed on 23 August 2005 on approach to [[Pucallpa Airport]], {{convert|4|mi}} off the airfield, following an [[emergency landing]] attempt because of bad weather, killing 40 of the 98 passengers and crew aboard.

==Aircraft and crew==
The aircraft involved was a 1981-built [[Boeing 737-200 Advanced|Boeing 737-244 Advanced]], [[Aircraft registration|registered]] OB-1809, which had been [[Aircraft lease|lease]]d to TANS Perú from the South African lessor company [[Safair]] two months prior to the accident.<ref name=\"TANS confirms 57 survivors in 737-200 crash\" /> With [[manufacturer's serial number]] 22580 and powered with two [[Pratt & Whitney JT8D|Pratt & Whitney JT8D-17A]] engines, the airframe had its maiden flight on 4 August 1981, and was originally delivered to [[South African Airways]].<ref name=\"ASN\">{{ASN accident|id= 20050823-0|accessdate= 16 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airfleets.net/ficheapp/plane-b737-22580.htm|title=TANS OB-1809-P aircraft history|last=|first=|date=|website=Airfleets.net|publisher=Airfleets aviation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref> At the time of the accident the aircraft had accumulated 49,865 flight hours and 45,262 cycles,<ref name=\"Final report\"/> and was {{Age|1981|8|4|2005|8|23}} years old.

The captain was 45-year-old Octavio Perez Palma Garreta, who had 5,867 flight hours, including 3,763 hours on the Boeing 737. The first officer was 37-year-old Jorge Luis Pinto Panta, who had 4,755 flight hours, with 1,109 of them on the Boeing 737. 38-year-old Gonzalo Chirinos Delgado, a trainee pilot, was also on board. He had 2,700 flight hours, but only 61 of them on the Boeing 737.<ref name=\"TANS confirms 57 survivors in 737-200 crash\" />{{Rp|7–10}}

==Description of the accident==
There was an unusual developing [[cold front]] in the vicinity of Pucallpa, minutes before the event took place, with [[cloud top]]s estimated to be {{convert|45000|ft}} high.<ref name=\"Final report\"/> Instead of diverting to another airport, the crew initiated the approach to Pucallpa Airport with torrential rain, hail and strong winds.<ref name=\"58 walk away from Peruvian plane crash\"/> Some {{cardinal to word|10}} minutes before the scheduled time for landing the aircraft started rocking.<ref name=\"58 walk away from Peruvian plane crash\"/> Realising that the airport could not be safely reached amid the worsening weather conditions, the pilot attempted an emergency landing. The aircraft was flying through a [[hail]]storm for the last 32 seconds of its ill-fated flight when it was seemingly taken down by a wind shear, hit tree tops, impacted terrain in a [[swamp]] located {{convert|3.8|nmi}} ahead of the [[runway]] threshold, broke up as it [[Emergency landing|crash landed]] and burst into flames, leaving a path of debris and flaming fuel {{convert|100|ft}} wide and {{convert|0.8|nmi}} long.<ref name=\"Final report\"/><ref name=\"58 walk away from Peruvian plane crash\"/> The wreckage of the airplane was engulfed by the fire.<ref name=\"Final report\"/>

There were 91 passengers and seven [[Aircrew|crew member]]s on board; {{cardinal|35}} passengers and {{cardinal to word|5}} crew (including all three flight crew) lost their lives in the accident.<ref name=\"Final report\" />{{rp|7}} Non-[[Peru]]vian occupants of the aircraft included 11 [[Americans]], one Australian, one Colombian, and one [[Spain|Spaniard]]; Italians were also aboard, but the actual figures for them depend upon the source.<ref name=\"58 walk away from Peruvian plane crash\" /><ref name=\"Plane crashes in Peruvian jungle\">{{cite news|title=Plane crashes in Peruvian jungle |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4178868.stm |date=24 August 2005 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67aNlpfwj?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4178868.stm |archivedate=11 May 2012 |accessdate=11 May 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> Most of the fatalities were recorded for passengers travelling in the front of the aircraft.<ref name=\"Final report\" /> Fifty-eight people survived the accident, many of them suffering serious injuries, mostly burns and broken limbs.<ref name=\"Final report\"/><ref name=\"Plane crashes in Peruvian jungle\"/>

==Investigation==
Investigation of the crash site was hindered by looters, who descended upon the crash and stole various elements to be sold for scrap.<ref name=\"Escape from flight 204\" /> A {{US$|500|2005|link=yes}} reward did succeed in securing the return of the [[flight data recorder]].<ref name=\"Data recorder from Peru plane crash found\" /> After 312 days of investigations, there were no reports of any technical malfunction.<ref name=\"Final report\"/><ref name=\"ASN\"/> The official cause of the accident was determined to be [[pilot error]] for not following standard procedures under adverse weather conditions.<ref name=\"Final report\"/> The captain took control of the plane, but the trainee pilot did not immediately monitor the instruments; as a result, the crew did not notice the rapid descent in the few crucial seconds they had where they could have avoided danger. According to [[Aviation Safety Network]], the accident ranks among the deadliest ones that took place in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title= Accident record for 2005|work= Aviation Safety Network|accessdate= 11 May 2012|url= http://aviation-safety.net/database/dblist.php?Year=2005&lang=&page=1}}</ref> It was also the second major crash involving a TANS Perú airplane in slightly over two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/operator/airline.php?var=4736|title=Accident record for TANS Perú|last=Ranter|first=Harro|date=|work=aviation-safety.net|publisher=Aviation Safety Network|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=16 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/24/world/americas/24iht-web.0824peru.html|title=At least 41 dead in Peruvian plane crash|date=24 August 2005|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=11 May 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67aUXB0iB?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/24/world/americas/24iht-web.0824peru.html?_r=1|archivedate=11 May 2012|publisher=Associated Press|location=[[Lima]]|issn=0362-4331|quote=In January 2003, a TANS twin engine Fokker 28 turbojet, plowed into a 11,550-foot (3,465-meter) high mountain in Peru's northern jungle, killing all 42 passengers – including eight children – and four crew members aboard.|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Life and career==
Almeida belongs to a community of [[Goan Catholics]] who migrated to [[Karachi]] more than a hundred years ago. His family is said to speak [[Konkani language|Konkani]] at home. Many members of the community left for western countries after the [[Partition of India|Partition]], but about 15,000 members still live in Pakistan.<ref name=\"News182\"/> Reportedly, he first visited [[Goa]], India in 2012 to participate in an arts and literary festival, and then followed it up with two more visits.<ref name=\"News182\"/>

He earned an undergraduate degree in economics from the [[Lahore University of Management Sciences]] in 2003. He was a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] in 2004 and received a second BA in jurisprudence from [[Oxford University]].<ref>[http://www.goaartlitfest.com/galf2011/participatingauthors_2011.htm#Cyril_Almeida Goa Arts and Literary Festival 2013]</ref>

==2016 Travel ban==
In October 2016, ''Dawn'' published a front-page article by Almeida, which said that some in the Pakistan's civilian government confronted military officials at a top-secret national security Committee meeting. They said that they were being asked to do more to crack down on armed groups, yet, whenever law-enforcement agencies took action, \"the security establishment ... worked behind the scenes to set the arrested free\". He reported that the civilians warned that Pakistan risked international isolation if the security establishment didn't crack down on terrorist groups operating from Pakistan.<ref name=AlJazeera>

The army maintained that it was a \"false and fabricated story\" and it represented a breach of national security.

On 29 October 2016, the government held [[Pervez Rasheed]], the minister for [[Ministry of Information, Broadcasting and National Heritage (Pakistan)|information]], responsible for leaking the information that led to Cyril Almeida's news report. The minister was made to resign.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/news/1293026 Information Minister Pervaiz Rasheed asked to step down amid Dawn story probe], Dawn, 30 October 2016.</ref>

== 2018 treason charges ==
On 12 May 2018, Cyril Almeida published an interview of the former prime minister [[Nawaz Sharif]], where Shaif is reported to have said, in connection with the trial of the accused in the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]]:
{{quote|\"Militant organizations are active. Call them non-state actors, should we allow them to cross the border and kill 150 people in Mumbai? Explain it to me. Why can’t we complete the trial?\"}}
After the interview was published, the [[Pakistan Press Council]] issued a notice to ''Dawn'' stating that it published information that \"may bring into contempt Pakistan or its people or tends to undermine its sovereignty or integrity as an independent country.\" The distribution of the newspaper was subsequently blocked in parts of the country. Scholar Madiha Afzal states that the Pakistani military was behind the efforts of censorship.<ref>Madiha Afzal, [https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/05/30/pakistans-censorship-model/ Pakistan’s censorship model: An image- and identity-obsessed country], Brookings Institution, 30 May 2018.</ref>

In September 2018, Azhar Siddiqui, a lawyer, petitioned the [[Lahore High Court]], accusing Nawaz Sharif and former prime minister [[Shahid Khaqan Abbasi]] of treason. He alleged that Abbasi had leaked the minutes of the [[National Security Council (Pakistan)|National Security Council]] to Sharif, whose statement contained such information. Almeida was asked to appear before the court and, when he failed to appear in three sittings, a non-bailable arrest warrant was issued against him. He was also placed on the Exit Control List, banning travel abroad.

'''Kasaragod district''' is one of the 14 districts in the southern [[India|Indian]] state of [[Kerala]]. It's a northern most district of Kerala. [[Kasaragod]] was a part of the South Canara district of the erstwhile Madras Presidency. It then became a part of Kannur district of Kerala. Kasaragod was declared as a district on 24 May 1984.

In March 2020, Kasaragod was one of the worst affected districts in Kerala by the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay.aspx?newsID=690264|title=Kasargod: Number of coronavirus-affected people continues to swell|website=www.daijiworld.com|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

== Overview ==
The district is bordered to the south by [[Kerala]]'s [[Kannur district]], and to the southeast and north by [[Karnataka]]'s districts of [[Kodagu district|Kodagu]] and [[Dakshina Kannada]] respectively. To the east, the district is bordered by the [[Western Ghats]], while along the west, it is bordered by the [[Laccadive Sea]].

The district, covering an area of around 1992&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, has a population (2011 [[census]]) of 1,307,375. It has four [[taluk]]s, namely, [[Kasaragod taluk|Kasaragod]], [[Hosdurg taluk|Hosdurg]], [[Vellarikundu]] and [[Manjeshwaram Taluk]]. 

It has three municipalities: [[Kasaragod]], [[Kanhangad]], [[Nileshwaram]] and 38 [[Gram panchayat]]s.<ref>[http://www.kasargod.nic.in/administration/pangrama.htm There are 38 Grama Panchayats in Kasaragod District] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006142922/http://kasargod.nic.in/administration/pangrama.htm |date=6 October 2014 }} (kasaragod.nic.in).</ref>

== History ==
{{Main article|History of Kasaragod}}
Kasaragod was known to the [[Arabs]] by the name ''Harkwillia''.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ksd.kerala.gov.in/hist.htm |title=Kasaragod History |publisher=Government of Kerala |accessdate=2009-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925134038/http://www.ksd.kerala.gov.in/hist.htm |archivedate=25 September 2008 }}</ref>
Many Arab travelers who visited Kerala between the 9th and the 14th centuries visited Kasaragod, which was an important trade centre then. ''Duarte Borbosa'', the Portuguese traveler who visited [[Kumbla]], near [[Kasaragod Town|Kasaragod]] in 1514, recorded rice being exported for coir to [[Maldives]].<ref name=\"history\" />

Kasaragod was part of the kumbala Kingdom in which there were 64 [[Malayalam]] and [[Tulu people|Tulu]]  villages.<ref name=\"history\" />
When the [[Vijayanagara empire]] attacked Kasaragod, it was still under the [[Kolathiri]] [[Raja]] who had Nileshwaram as one of his capitals. During the decline of the Vijayanagara empire, the administration of this area was vested with [[Nayakas of Keladi|Ikkeri Nayakas]].<ref name=\"history\" /> At the onset of collapse of the Vijayanagara empire, ''Venkappa Nayaka'' declared independence to Ikkery. Kumbla, Chandragiri and Bekal are considered to be the chain of forts constructed or renovated by [[Shivappa Nayaka]].<ref name=\"history\" />

Francis Buccanan, the family doctor of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]], visited Kasargod in 1800.<ref name=\"history\" /> In his travelogue, he recorded information on places like Athiraparambu, Kavvai, [[Nileshwaram]], [[Bekal]], [[Chandragiri]] and [[Manjeshwar]].<ref name=\"history\" /> Hosdurg and Vellarikundu is part of Kolathunadu  (south of Chandragiri river) and Kasaragod and Manjeshwaram is in the Tulunadu region (north of Chandragiri river).
In 1763, [[Hyder Ali]] conquered Bedanoor (Bidnur), the capital of the Ikkery Naiks. His son [[Tippu Sultan]] conquered much of [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]]. As per the ''Sreerangapattanam Treaty'' of 1792, Tippu surrendered Malabar, except [[Kanara]] to the [[British India|British]]. The British occupied Kanara only after the death of Tippu Sultan.<ref name=\"history\" /> it is said that ''Kinavoor Molom'' (Sree Dharma Shashtha Temple)is belonging to ''Karinthalam'' (one of 64 Brahmin villages in old Kerala).

Before the formation of Kerala, Kasaragod was a part of [[South Canara]] district of erstwhile [[Madras Presidency]]. Kasaragod became part of [[Kannur district]] following the reorganisation of states and formation of Kerala in 1 November 1956.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://kasargod.nic.in/profile/afterdisform.htm |title= Kasaragod - After District Formation |publisher= Kasaragod District |accessdate= 2009-03-11 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090410025049/http://kasargod.nic.in/profile/afterdisform.htm |archive-date= 10 April 2009 |url-status= dead }}</ref> Kasaragod was declared a district in the year 1984. Merger of Kasargod with Kerala has been a contentious issue as there is a sizeable population which speaks Kannada and Tulu which are the languages of Karnataka. Government of India formed the Mahajan Commission on 25 October 1966 to look into the issue along with a similar issue Karnataka had with Maharashtra over Belagaavi district. The commission was headed by the third Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India, Meher Chand Mahajan. The commission recommended that the part of the district that is to the north of Chandragiri river, which includes the Kasargod town, should be merged with Karnataka.

'''Kasaragod district''' is one of the 14 districts in the southern [[India|Indian]] state of [[Kerala]]. It's a northern most district of Kerala. [[Kasaragod]] was a part of the South Canara district of the erstwhile Madras Presidency. It then became a part of Kannur district of Kerala. Kasaragod was declared as a district on 24 May 1984.

In March 2020, Kasaragod was one of the worst affected districts in Kerala by the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay.aspx?newsID=690264|title=Kasargod: Number of coronavirus-affected people continues to swell|website=www.daijiworld.com|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

== Overview ==
The district is bordered to the south by [[Kerala]]'s [[Kannur district]], and to the southeast and north by [[Karnataka]]'s districts of [[Kodagu district|Kodagu]] and [[Dakshina Kannada]] respectively. To the east, the district is bordered by the [[Western Ghats]], while along the west, it is bordered by the [[Laccadive Sea]].

The district, covering an area of around 1992&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, has a population (2011 [[census]]) of 1,307,375. It has four [[taluk]]s, namely, [[Kasaragod taluk|Kasaragod]], [[Hosdurg taluk|Hosdurg]], [[Vellarikundu]] and [[Manjeshwaram Taluk]]. 

It has three municipalities: [[Kasaragod]], [[Kanhangad]], [[Nileshwaram]] and 38 [[Gram panchayat]]s.<ref>[http://www.kasargod.nic.in/administration/pangrama.htm There are 38 Grama Panchayats in Kasaragod District] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006142922/http://kasargod.nic.in/administration/pangrama.htm |date=6 October 2014 }} (kasaragod.nic.in).</ref>

== History ==
{{Main article|History of Kasaragod}}
Kasaragod was known to the [[Arabs]] by the name ''Harkwillia''.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ksd.kerala.gov.in/hist.htm |title=Kasaragod History |publisher=Government of Kerala |accessdate=2009-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925134038/http://www.ksd.kerala.gov.in/hist.htm |archivedate=25 September 2008 }}</ref>
Many Arab travelers who visited Kerala between the 9th and the 14th centuries visited Kasaragod, which was an important trade centre then. ''Duarte Borbosa'', the Portuguese traveler who visited [[Kumbla]], near [[Kasaragod Town|Kasaragod]] in 1514, recorded rice being exported for coir to [[Maldives]].<ref name=\"history\" />

Kasaragod was part of the kumbala Kingdom in which there were 64 [[Malayalam]] and [[Tulu people|Tulu]]  villages.<ref name=\"history\" />
When the [[Vijayanagara empire]] attacked Kasaragod, it was still under the [[Kolathiri]] [[Raja]] who had Nileshwaram as one of his capitals. During the decline of the Vijayanagara empire, the administration of this area was vested with [[Nayakas of Keladi|Ikkeri Nayakas]].<ref name=\"history\" /> At the onset of collapse of the Vijayanagara empire, ''Venkappa Nayaka'' declared independence to Ikkery. Kumbla, Chandragiri and Bekal are considered to be the chain of forts constructed or renovated by [[Shivappa Nayaka]].<ref name=\"history\" />

Francis Buccanan, the family doctor of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]], visited Kasargod in 1800.<ref name=\"history\" /> In his travelogue, he recorded information on places like Athiraparambu, Kavvai, [[Nileshwaram]], [[Bekal]], [[Chandragiri]] and [[Manjeshwar]].<ref name=\"history\" /> Hosdurg and Vellarikundu is part of Kolathunadu  (south of Chandragiri river) and Kasaragod and Manjeshwaram is in the Tulunadu region (north of Chandragiri river).
In 1763, [[Hyder Ali]] conquered Bedanoor (Bidnur), the capital of the Ikkery Naiks. His son [[Tippu Sultan]] conquered much of [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]]. As per the ''Sreerangapattanam Treaty'' of 1792, Tippu surrendered Malabar, except [[Kanara]] to the [[British India|British]]. The British occupied Kanara only after the death of Tippu Sultan.<ref name=\"history\" /> it is said that ''Kinavoor Molom'' (Sree Dharma Shashtha Temple)is belonging to ''Karinthalam'' (one of 64 Brahmin villages in old Kerala).

Before the formation of Kerala, Kasaragod was a part of [[South Canara]] district of erstwhile [[Madras Presidency]]. Kasaragod became part of [[Kannur district]] following the reorganisation of states and formation of Kerala in 1 November 1956.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://kasargod.nic.in/profile/afterdisform.htm |title= Kasaragod - After District Formation |publisher= Kasaragod District |accessdate= 2009-03-11 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090410025049/http://kasargod.nic.in/profile/afterdisform.htm |archive-date= 10 April 2009 |url-status= dead }}</ref> Kasaragod was declared a district in the year 1984. Merger of Kasargod with Kerala has been a contentious issue as there is a sizeable population which speaks Kannada and Tulu which are the languages of Karnataka. Government of India formed the Mahajan Commission on 25 October 1966 to look into the issue along with a similar issue Karnataka had with Maharashtra over Belagaavi district. The commission was headed by the third Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India, Meher Chand Mahajan. The commission recommended that the part of the district that is to the north of Chandragiri river, which includes the Kasargod town, should be merged with Karnataka.

==Controversies==
In 2018, India's principal opposition party, [[Indian National Congress]], accused [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]] of favouring Anil Ambani's defence manufacturing company over [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited|HAL]], a public sector enterprise, in a fighter aircraft deal worth INR 58,000 crores with French manufacturing firm [[Dassault]]. Ambani, several of whose companies are debt-ridden, has denied all charges of benefiting from crony capitalism. 

In a possibly related controversy, one of his businesses partly financed a French film in which former [[President of France|French president]] [[François Hollande|Francois Hollande]]'s then-partner had acted around the same time the aircraft deal was being negotiated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rafale-controversy-reliance-entertainment-francois-hollande-bjp-narendra-modi-india-france-5376140/ |title=Rafale row: Reliance Entertainment confirms it paid 1.4 million Euros for film by Hollande's partner through partner|date=27 September 2018|publisher=indianexpress.com}}</ref>

The Quarter-Finals of the Durand Cup shall be played between 12 teams. Five of the teams currently play in [[2012–13 I-League]], two played in the [[2012 I-League 2nd Division]] and one currently play in the [[Mumbai Football League]]. The other four spots would have been taken up by the top three teams from the preliminary round plus one service team. However, on 22 August 2012 it was announced that [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited S.C.|HAL SC]] would withdraw from the tournament (along with [[Churchill Brothers S.C.]] who withdrew before the initial list of teams was released) and thus freeing an extra space.

'''Madison station''' is a former railroad station in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. The station served passenger and freight trains of the [[Chicago and North Western Railway]] (C&NW). Passenger service ended in 1965 and the passenger station and freight depot was bought by [[Madison Gas and Electric]] (MGE) and has been renovated to serve as offices. The station and freight depot are listed as contributing properties on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] [[East Wilson Street Historic District]]. The [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]] (commonly known as the Milwaukee Road) had tracks paralleling the C&NW and also had a nearby passenger station.

==History==
===Early depots===
The first railroad entering Madison was the Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad, a predecessor of the Milwaukee Road. Their depot was established on the west side of Madison in 1854.<ref name=\"West\">{{cite web|title=West Madison Depot, Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railway|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|date=February 1981|location=[[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]|first1=Lance|last1=Neckar|first2=Katharine H.|last2=Rankin|url={{NRHP url|id=85000990}}|accessdate=April 8, 2020|work=[[NRHP]] Inventory-Nomination Form}}</ref> The Chicago and North Western constructed a line to Madison in 1864 from the south, crossing [[Lake Monona|Monona Bay]].

Madison eventually became a junction point for the Chicago and North Western, as lines were completed north to [[Baraboo, Wisconsin|Baraboo]] and [[Minneapolis]]. Other lines to [[Lancaster, Wisconsin|Lancaster]] and [[Milwaukee]] were completed in the early 1800s. A new station was completed in the same location in 1885, and included a hotel and dining room within the structure.<ref name=\"NRHP\"/>

===Current depot===
After the opening of a new Milwaukee Road [[Milwaukee Road Depot (Madison, Wisconsin)|depot]] in West Madison, the C&NW made plans for a new larger station, costing [[USD|$]]500,000. Leaders in the government of Madison were in support of the plan, but nearby business owners and residents objected. These objections were due to the plan that would close the [[level crossing|crossing]] of Blount Street to allow for expanded [[railroad platform|platforms]]. A series of legal proceedings ending up costing 10 years before the C&NW revised plans.<ref name=\"NRHP\"/><ref name=\"Formative\"/>{{rp|263}}

==Site description==
The 1910 station was built as a partial [[railroad terminal|stub end terminal]], with two [[through track]]s connecting to the west. This configuration allowed for separate tracks that would be terminating at Madison, and avoided congestion.<ref name=\"Classic\"/> However, the [[Madison, Wisconsin#Geography|geography of Madison]] still required trains from Milwaukee to perform a backup move in order to access the northern line to Minneapolis.<ref name=\"Journal\"/> The structure was designed by the firm [[Frost & Granger]], who was notable for designing other railroad buildings such as the [[Chicago and North Western Terminal]] in Chicago. The two-story [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] structure was made from [[Bedford stone]] and was designed to be similar to the Chicago terminal.<ref name=\"NRHP\"/>

The nearby freight depot was built on the corner of Blair and Railroad Streets. It is two stories tall and made from red brick, with large rounded windows. A [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] was also built to the east of the station, and became notable with a boiler of a steam engine exploded in 1898.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicmadison.org/Madison's%20Past/connectingwithourpast/railroadstations.html|title=Railroad Stations|accessdate=April 10, 2020|website=Historic Madison, Inc. of Wisconsin|location=Madison}}</ref> The two tracks of the C&NW intersected a single track of the Milwaukee Road with an unique [[diamond crossing]] within a grade crossing of Blair Street.<ref name=\"NRHP\"/> Only one track currently remains, and is operated by the [[Wisconsin and Southern Railroad]].<ref>{{cite map|title=Wisconsin Railroads & Harbors 2020|author=[[Wisconsin Department of Transportation]]|date=January 2020|url=https://wisconsindot.gov/Documents/travel/rail/railmap.pdf|accessdate=March 27, 2020}}</ref> 

==Milwaukee Road Station==
The '''Franklin Street station''', also known as '''East Madison station''', was a [[Milwaukee Road]] station. It was located at 501 East Wilson Street, one [[city block|block]] west from the C&NW station. The first station on the site was built in 1869.<ref name=\"West\"/><ref name=\"Formative\"/>{{rp|124}} This was replaced with a 1886 structure in a [[Victorian Gothic]] style, in order to compete with the new C&NW station.<ref name=\"NRHP\"/> It served trains from Madison to [[Portage, Wisconsin|Portage]] and [[Milwaukee]], including the ''On Wisconsin''.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Official Guide of the Railways]]|date=June 1941|publisher=National Railways Publishing Company|location=[[New York City]]|page=964|section=[[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]]}}</ref> The station was demolished in 1952, and all Milwaukee Road passenger service shifted to the still-standing [[Milwaukee Road Depot (Madison, Wisconsin)|West Madison]] station.<ref name=\"NRHP\"/>

This configuration allowed for separate tracks that would be terminating at Madison, and avoided congestion.<ref name=\"Classic\"/> However, the [[Madison, Wisconsin#Geography|geography of Madison]] still required trains from Milwaukee to perform a backup move in order to access the northern line to Minneapolis.<ref name=\"Journal\"/> The structure was designed by the firm [[Frost & Granger]], who was notable for designing other railroad buildings such as the [[Chicago and North Western Terminal]] in Chicago. The two-story [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] structure was made from [[Bedford stone]] and was designed to be similar to the Chicago terminal.<ref name=\"NRHP\"/>

The nearby freight depot was built on the corner of Blair and Railroad Streets. It is two stories tall and made from red brick, with large rounded windows. A [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] was also built to the east of the station, and became notable with a boiler of a steam engine exploded in 1898.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicmadison.org/Madison's%20Past/connectingwithourpast/railroadstations.html|title=Railroad Stations|accessdate=April 10, 2020|website=Historic Madison, Inc. of Wisconsin|location=Madison}}</ref> The two tracks of the C&NW intersected a single track of the Milwaukee Road with an unique [[diamond crossing]] within a grade crossing of Blair Street.<ref name=\"NRHP\"/> Only one track currently remains, and is operated by the [[Wisconsin and Southern Railroad]].<ref>{{cite map|title=Wisconsin Railroads & Harbors 2020|author=[[Wisconsin Department of Transportation]]|date=January 2020|url=https://wisconsindot.gov/Documents/travel/rail/railmap.pdf|accessdate=March 27, 2020}}</ref>

The '''Attack on Sudbury,''' also known as '''The Sudbury Fight''' (April 21, 1676), was a battle of [[King Philip's War]], fought in what is today [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]] and [[Wayland, Massachusetts]], when approximately five hundred [[Wampanoag]], [[Nipmuc]], and [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] raided the frontier settlement of Sudbury in [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Disparate companies of [[English people|English]] [[Militia|militiamen]] from nearby settlements marched to the town's defense, two of which were drawn into Native ambushes and suffered heavy losses. The battle was the last major Native American victory in King Philip's War before their final defeat in southern [[New England]] in August 1676.   
== Background ==
The winter of 1676 brought a lull in the fighting of King Philip's War in eastern [[Massachusetts]], but come spring Native American forces resumed their raids on the area's [[Puritans|Puritan]] towns. The Native coalition attacked the strategically significant fort at [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]] on both March 16 and April 7, destroying most of the settlement and forcing a partial evacuation of its residents. In response to these attacks, as well as the recent abandonment of [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]] and [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], the colonial Council of War dispatched Captain Samuel Wadsworth and fifty men to Marlborough to reinforce the frontier. Wadsworth's company passed through Sudbury on the evening of April 20.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Schultz, Tougias|first=|title=King Philip's War: The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict|publisher=The Countryman Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=207-213}}</ref>

\"Hearing the alarm,\"<ref name=\":3\" /> about a dozen men of Concord marched to Sudbury's defense. They were ambushed and massacred within full view of the defenders of the Haynes garrison. Only one of the Concord men escaped with his life,<ref name=\":0\" /> and the dead were buried in a mass grave just east of [[Old Town Bridge (Wayland, Massachusetts)|Old Town Bridge]] in Wayland. 

Flushed with victory, Native forces crossed the river and set about pillaging the central settlement of Sudbury. Shortly before noon, English militiamen from [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] under the command of Captain Hugh Mason arrived and successfully repelled the raiding party.<ref name=\":0\" /> 
[[File:King Philip (1900) (14765360792).jpg|thumb|300px|left|A depiction of the attack on the town]]

As Mason took back control of the town, Captain Wadsworth approached from the west with about seventy men,<ref name=\":5\" /> his numbers bolstered by Captain Samuel Brocklebank's garrison at Marlborough. Wadsworth's men had rested only briefly in Marlborough before their march back east to defend Sudbury; they were hungry, exhausted, and completely ignorant of their enemy's position.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfGNboAyrA|title=The Sudbury Fight, 1676: A Decisive Native American Victory in King Philip's War|last=Rakich|first=Andrew|date=2019|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A mile from town, Wadsworth's men spotted about a hundred armed Natives darting off into the woods. Believing that \"these they might easily deal with,\"<ref name=\":3\" /> the militia set off in pursuit. 

The Natives led the militia to the low ground between Goodman's Hill and Green Hill in present-day Sudbury, where they sprang an ambush, surrounding the small English force. Wadsworth fought his way to the summit of Green Hill, ordering his men to form a square, and repulsed multiple Native charges.<ref name=\":3\" /> The fighting went on all afternoon.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Watertown militia and two companies of English cavalry repeatedly attempted to rescue Wadsworth, but ultimately failed to break the Native envelopment and were forced to retreat.<ref name=\":4\" />  

Native warriors then set fire to the dry brush of the hill, choking Wadsworth's beleaguered company with smoke.<ref name=\":0\" /> In a panic, the English broke and ran. Half the militiamen were killed in the [[rout]], including Wadsworth and Brocklebank.<ref name=\":4\" /> The survivors fled south toward the Goodenow garrison house on [[Boston Post Road]], where Mason's company and the cavalry were regrouping. Thirteen or fourteen militiamen also took refuge in the fortified Noyes [[Gristmill|grist mill]] until they were eventually rescued.<ref name=\":2\" />

According to [[Increase Mather]], the Natives took \"five or six of the English alive\" and \"stripped them naked, and caused them to run the gauntlet, whipping them after a cruel and bloody manner, and then threw hot ashes upon them; cut the flesh of their legs, and put fire into their wounds, delighting to see the miserable torments of wretched creatures.\"<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Mather|first=Increase|title=A Brief History of the War With the Indians in New England|publisher=John Foster|year=1676|isbn=|location=|pages=45}}</ref> Hubbard also claims English captives were tortured,<ref name=\":3\" /> but [[Mary Rowlandson]], a captive of the sachem [[Weetamoo]] who was present in the Native camp during the battle, makes no mention of it in her memoirs.<ref name=\":1\" /> 

== Aftermath ==
As night fell, Native forces withdrew from Sudbury. Early the next day, English soldiers, together with a group of allied [[Praying Indian|Praying Indians]], set out to the battlefield to bury the dead.<ref name=\":2\" /> 

Rowlandson claims that despite their victory, morale among the Native coalition was low after the Sudbury Fight: <blockquote>\"They came home without that rejoicing and triumphing over their victory which they were wont to show at other times; but rather like dogs (as they say) which have lost their ears. Yet I could not perceive that it was for their own loss of men. They said they had not lost above five or six; and I missed none, except in one wigwam. When they went, they acted as if the Devil had told them that they should gain the victory; and now they acted as if the Devil had told them they should have a fall. Whither it were so or no, I cannot tell, but so it proved, for quickly they began to fall, and so held on that summer, till they came to utter ruin.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> </blockquote>Hubbard and Mather<ref name=\":5\" /> disagree with Rowlandson, putting the Native dead at a \"hundred and twenty,\"<ref name=\":3\" /> and in the autumn of 1676, prominent citizens of Sudbury recounted that they had made a \"considerable slaughter\"<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/topic/newengland/philip/11-20/ch16pt3.html|title=Letter From the Citizens of Sudbury to the General Court of Boston, October 1676|last=|first=|date=2001|website=US Gen Net|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> of Native attackers. On the morning of April 22, Native warriors taunted militiamen in Marlborough by shouting seventy-four times to indicate the number of their enemy they believed they had killed at Sudbury.<ref name=\":0\" />

== Legacy ==
[[Image:SudburyMA FightMarker.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Marker commemorating the battle]]

In 1730, Samuel Wadsworth's son [[Benjamin Wadsworth|Benjamin]] (then president of [[Harvard University|Harvard College]]) dedicated a memorial stone over the mass grave where his father had been buried alongside his men.<ref name=\":0\" /> The stone incorrectly dates the battle to April 18, likely an error of Hubbard's<ref name=\":3\" /> that was subsequently reprinted (both Mather<ref name=\":5\" /> and the citizens of [[17th century]] Sudbury themselves<ref name=\":6\" /> state that the battle took place on April 21). In 1852, the remains of Wadsworth's militia were excavated and reinterred fifty feet north<ref name=\":0\" /> to the site of a new monument near the base of Green Hill.

A handful of other monuments and markers in Sudbury and Wayland commemorate the Sudbury Fight, most of which were erected in the 1930s to celebrate Massachusetts's [[tricentennial]]. The battlefield around Goodman's Hill and Green Hill is now the site of an affluent residential neighborhood.<ref name=\":4\" />

Wadsworth's men had rested only briefly in Marlborough before their march back east to defend Sudbury; they were hungry, exhausted, and completely ignorant of their enemy's position.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfGNboAyrA|title=The Sudbury Fight, 1676: A Decisive Native American Victory in King Philip's War|last=Rakich|first=Andrew|date=2019|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A mile from town, Wadsworth's men spotted about a hundred armed Natives darting off into the woods. Believing that \"these they might easily deal with,\"<ref name=\":3\" /> the militia set off in pursuit. 

The Natives led the militia to the low ground between Goodman's Hill and Green Hill in present-day Sudbury, where they sprang an ambush, surrounding the small English force. Wadsworth fought his way to the summit of Green Hill, ordering his men to form a square, and repulsed multiple Native charges.<ref name=\":3\" /> The fighting went on all afternoon.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Watertown militia and two companies of English cavalry repeatedly attempted to rescue Wadsworth, but ultimately failed to break the Native envelopment and were forced to retreat.<ref name=\":4\" />  

Native warriors then set fire to the dry brush of the hill, choking Wadsworth's beleaguered company with smoke.<ref name=\":0\" /> In a panic, the English broke and ran. Half the militiamen were killed in the [[rout]], including Wadsworth and Brocklebank.<ref name=\":4\" /> The survivors fled south toward the Goodenow garrison house on [[Boston Post Road]], where Mason's company and the cavalry was regrouping. Thirteen or fourteen militiamen also took refuge in the fortified Noyes [[Gristmill|grist mill]] until they were eventually rescued.<ref name=\":2\" />

According to [[Increase Mather]], the Natives took \"five or six of the English alive\" and \"stripped them naked, and caused them to run the gauntlet, whipping them after a cruel and bloody manner, and then threw hot ashes upon them; cut the flesh of their legs, and put fire into their wounds, delighting to see the miserable torments of wretched creatures. Thus [the Indians] are the perfect children of the Devil.\"<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Mather|first=Increase|title=A Brief History of the War With the Indians in New England|publisher=John Foster|year=1676|isbn=|location=|pages=45}}</ref> Hubbard also claims English captives were tortured,<ref name=\":3\" /> but [[Mary Rowlandson]], a captive of the sachem [[Weetamoo]] who was present in the Native camp during the battle, makes no mention of it in her memoirs.<ref name=\":1\" /> 

== Aftermath ==
As night fell, Native forces withdrew from Sudbury. Early the next day, English soldiers, together with a group of allied [[Praying Indian|Praying Indians]], set out to the battlefield to bury the dead.<ref name=\":2\" /> 

Rowlandson claims that despite their victory, morale among the Native coalition was low after the Sudbury Fight: <blockquote>\"They came home without that rejoicing and triumphing over their victory which they were wont to show at other times; but rather like dogs (as they say) which have lost their ears. Yet I could not perceive that it was for their own loss of men. They said they had not lost above five or six; and I missed none, except in one wigwam. When they went, they acted as if the Devil had told them that they should gain the victory; and now they acted as if the Devil had told them they should have a fall. Whither it were so or no, I cannot tell, but so it proved, for quickly they began to fall, and so held on that summer, till they came to utter ruin.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> </blockquote>Hubbard and Mather<ref name=\":5\" /> disagree with Rowlandson, putting the Native dead at a \"hundred and twenty,\"<ref name=\":3\" /> and in the autumn of 1676, prominent citizens of Sudbury recounted that they had made a \"considerable slaughter\"<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/topic/newengland/philip/11-20/ch16pt3.html|title=Letter From the Citizens of Sudbury to the General Court of Boston, October 1676|last=|first=|date=2001|website=US Gen Net|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> of Native attackers. On the morning of April 22, Native warriors taunted militiamen in Marlborough by shouting seventy-four times to indicate the number of their enemy they believed they had killed at Sudbury.<ref name=\":0\" />

== Legacy ==
[[Image:SudburyMA FightMarker.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Marker commemorating the battle]]

In 1730, Samuel Wadsworth's son [[Benjamin Wadsworth|Benjamin]] (then president of [[Harvard University|Harvard College]]) dedicated a memorial stone over the mass grave where his father had been buried alongside his men.<ref name=\":0\" /> The stone incorrectly dates the battle to April 18, likely an error of Hubbard's<ref name=\":3\" /> that was subsequently reprinted (both Mather<ref name=\":5\" /> and the citizens of [[17th century]] Sudbury themselves<ref name=\":6\" /> state that the battle took place on April 21). In 1852, the remains of Wadsworth's militia were excavated and reinterred fifty feet north<ref name=\":0\" /> to the site of a new monument near the base of Green Hill.

A handful of other monuments and markers in Sudbury and Wayland commemorate the Sudbury Fight, most of which were erected in the 1930s to celebrate Massachusetts's [[tricentennial]]. The battlefield around Goodman's Hill and Green Hill is now the site of an affluent residential neighborhood.<ref name=\":4\" />

==Taxonomy and phylogenetics==

[[Johan Christian Fabricius]], a Danish zoologist, classified ''S. cyanea'' in 1775. The genus ''[[Synoeca]]'' is a part of the paper wasp tribe [[Epiponini]] and consists of five species (''S. chalibea'', ''S. virginea'', ''[[Synoeca septentrionalis|S. septentrionalis]]'', ''[[Synoeca surinama|S. surinama]]'', and ''S. cyanea''). ''Synoeca'' is a basal genus in the tribe. Cyanea, the adjective describing the species, translates to “dark blue,” referring to the metallic blue patches on the exterior of ''S. cyanea''.<ref>{{cite journal

==Description and identification==

''S. cyanea'' is black with metallic blue patches on its body. In addition, ''S. cyanea'' has a red [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|clypeus]].<ref name=\"Henrique-Simoes 2011\"/> While other species in the genus ''Synoeca'' do not demonstrate [[caste]] differences, ''S. cyanea'' sometimes shows differentiation between the size of workers and the queen. A queen of a nest that is early in development will often be the same size as the workers and intermediates as it has not fully developed its reproductive organs. As the colony and nest grow, the queen also grows in size, due to ovarian development, until it is larger than the workers and intermediates.<ref>{{cite journal

==The Nest==

It is suggested that the architecture of the nest serves as protection against the predation of ants.<ref name=\"Elisei 2005\"/>

==Distribution and habitat==

While the genus ''Synoeca'' is found from Mexico to Argentina, ''S. cyanea'' is native to almost the whole country of Brazil.<ref name=\"Elisei 2005\"/> Typically, nests are found in the [[Restinga]] and the Atlantic Rain Forest. However, ''S. cyanea'' has been known to forage and make nests in [[mangrove]] areas.<ref name=\"De M Santos 2007\">{{cite journal

 | doi=10.1590/s1519-566x2007000200002| doi-access=free
 }}</ref>

==Colony cycle==

''S. cyanea'' starts a new colony cycle during the spring as it gets warmer. The first stage of a new colony is known as the pre-emergence state, in which workers have not been produced. No adult offspring are present and the larvae are still very young. A pre-emergent colony can have one or more queens.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>

Following the pre-emergent state, the colony grows to the emergent stage. Workers are present along with larvae of different ages and multiple adult generations. In nests with fewer queens, intermediate females can be found.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>

''S. cyanea'' males are present in the colony during the male-producing stage.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>

Upon nest abandonment during the late summer, the colony shifts to the quiescent stage, i.e. the nest site no longer houses wasps.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\" />

==Behavior==

===Dominance hierarchy===

The hierarchy of ''S. cyanea'' is based on physiology, specifically ovarian development. Wasps containing undeveloped filamentous [[ovariole]]s, slightly developed oocytes, or some mature oocytes are considered workers and intermediates. Wasps with well-developed and longer ovarioles with mature oocytes become queens. The number of queens in the colony determines the development of a queen’s ovaries. If there are more queens present, the ovaries are at a lower degree of development. One benefit to this is that as a swarming insect, queens with smaller abdomens are able to fly more easily  than queens with larger abdomens. This makes the queen less susceptible to predators.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>

===Foraging===

Foraging activity for the swarm-founding wasp ''S. cyanea'' begins early in the morning and stops in the evening. During the hottest hours of the day, activity of the wasps is highest. In addition to temperature, ''S. cyanea'' increase their activity with decreased levels of humidity and heightened intensities of light. While foraging, the wasps collect water for temperature control, wood pulp for building and repairing the nest, sugary substances for both the larvae and adults and finally animal protein for larvae.<ref name=\"Elisei 2005\"/>

===Nest repair===

Following damage by rain to the nest, ''S. cyanea'' will seal a leak of water with their mouth-pieces. Individuals begin by suctioning the water from the wall of the nest and then finish by expelling the water to the exterior of the colony. The hole is then repaired using wood pulp.<ref name=\"Elisei 2005\"/>

==Kin selection==

===Worker-queen conflict===

In ''S. cyanea'', discrimination between the queen and workers is often not determined by morphology, but by physiology. Young females in the colony can develop ovaries at different points in the cycle, so castes must be determined by the adult wasps rather than at the larval stage. Often, adult wasps will manipulate young females and suppress their ovaries because a wasp becomes a queen once she has mated. The number of queens allowed in a nest often fluctuates. When queen repopulation is not needed workerpolicing helps to prevent female egg-layers through [[Oophagy|egg-eating]] and aggressive behaviors.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>

==Interaction with other species==

===Diet===

The wasps forage for sugary substances o feed to both larvae and adult wasps.<ref name=\"Elisei 2005\"/> Additionally, [[necrophagy]] is a common practice for swarm-founding Neotropical bees and wasps, and one species that practices this is ''S. cyanea''.<ref name=\"O'Donnell 1995\">{{cite journal

===Defense===

==Human importance==

===Venom===

''S. cyanea'' venom is strong enough to cause [[haemolytic]] activity. [[Rhabdomyolysis]] and hemorrhage may also occur. In mice, abdominal spasms, ataxia, defecation, dyspnoea, hyperactivity, hypoactivity, sweating, and throes were observed following venom injection. ''S. cyanea'' venom also contains some antibacterial activity.<ref name=\"Mortari 2012\"/>

===Bites{{clarify|date=September 2017}} and stings===

Human accidents with wasps can occur one of two ways. Either a human may receive no more than one or two stings, or a swarm may attack a human. Symptoms following the attack can range from inflammatory reactions to severe allergic reactions resulting in anaphylactic shock. In some cases, death may occur following several bites{{clarify|date=September 2017}}<!--why should bites be significant?--> and a large amount of venom injection; however, a wasp sting typically will not produce a reaction more severe than local symptoms that affect only the skin.<ref name=\"Mortari 2012\"/>

=== Biocontrol Agent ===
In Brazil, the fruit fly, ''Zaprionus indianus'', is a common pest species that inflicts damage to multiple types of fruit trees. Since ''S. cyanea ''may obtain many nutrients from these fruit trees, researchers have observed the predatory nature of these wasps on ''Z. indianus''. When ''S. cyanea'' detect the fruit fly larvae, they soften, remove, and transport them back to the colony. For this reason, many fruit farmers consider ''S. cyanea'' a prospective candidate for use in pest management.<ref>{{Cite journal|url =http://journals.fcla.edu/flaent/article/view/82345 |title = Predation of Zaprinus indianus (Diptera: Drosophilidae) by the Social Wasp Synoeca cyanea (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)|last = Prezoto|first = Fabio|date = 2013|journal = Florida Entomologist|accessdate = |doi = 10.1653/024.096.0243|pmid = |volume = 96|pages = 670–672|issue = 2|doi-access = free}}</ref>

==Description and identification==

''S. cyanea'' is black with metallic blue patches on its body. In addition, ''S. cyanea'' has a red [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|clypeus]].<ref name=\"Henrique-Simoes 2011\"/> While other species in the genus ''Synoeca'' do not demonstrate [[caste]] differences, ''S. cyanea'' sometimes shows differentiation between the size of workers and the queen. A queen of a nest that is early in development will often be the same size as the workers and intermediates as it has not fully developed its reproductive organs. As the colony and nest grow, the queen also grows in size, due to ovarian development, until it is larger than the workers and intermediates.<ref>{{cite journal

It is suggested that the architecture of the nest serves as protection against the predation of ants.<ref name=\"Elisei 2005\"/>

==Distribution and habitat==

While the genus ''Synoeca'' is found from Mexico to Argentina, ''S. cyanea'' is native to almost the whole country of Brazil.<ref name=\"Elisei 2005\"/> Typically, nests are found in the [[Restinga]] and the Atlantic Rain Forest. However, ''S. cyanea'' has been known to forage and make nests in [[mangrove]] areas.<ref name=\"De M Santos 2007\">{{cite journal

 }}</ref>

==Colony cycle==

''S. cyanea'' starts a new colony cycle during the spring as it gets warmer. The first stage of a new colony is known as the pre-emergence state, in which workers have not been produced. No adult offspring are present and the larvae are still very young. A pre-emergent colony can have one or more queens.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>

Following the pre-emergent state, the colony grows to the emergent stage. Workers are present along with larvae of different ages and multiple adult generations. In nests with fewer queens, intermediate females can be found.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>

''S. cyanea'' males are present in the colony during the male-producing stage.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>

Upon nest abandonment during the late summer, the colony shifts to the quiescent stage, i.e. the nest site no longer houses wasps.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\" />

==Behavior==

===Dominance hierarchy===

The hierarchy of ''S. cyanea'' is based on physiology, specifically ovarian development. Wasps containing undeveloped filamentous [[ovariole]]s, slightly developed oocytes, or some mature oocytes are considered workers and intermediates. Wasps with well-developed and longer ovarioles with mature oocytes become queens. The number of queens in the colony determines the development of a queen’s ovaries. If there are more queens present, the ovaries are at a lower degree of development. One benefit to this is that as a swarming insect, queens with smaller abdomens are able to fly more easily  than queens with larger abdomens. This makes the queen less susceptible to predators.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>

===Foraging===

Foraging activity for the swarm-founding wasp ''S. cyanea'' begins early in the morning and stops in the evening. During the hottest hours of the day, activity of the wasps is highest. In addition to temperature, ''S. cyanea'' increase their activity with decreased levels of humidity and heightened intensities of light. While foraging, the wasps collect water for temperature control, wood pulp for building and repairing the nest, sugary substances for both the larvae and adults and finally animal protein for larvae.<ref name=\"Elisei 2005\"/>

===Nest repair===

Following damage by rain to the nest, ''S. cyanea'' will seal a leak of water with their mouth-pieces. Individuals begin by suctioning the water from the wall of the nest and then finish by expelling the water to the exterior of the colony. The hole is then repaired using wood pulp.<ref name=\"Elisei 2005\"/>

==Kin selection==

===Worker-queen conflict===

In ''S. cyanea'', discrimination between the queen and workers is often not determined by morphology, but by physiology. Young females in the colony can develop ovaries at different points in the cycle, so castes must be determined by the adult wasps rather than at the larval stage. Often, adult wasps will manipulate young females and suppress their ovaries because a wasp becomes a queen once she has mated. The number of queens allowed in a nest often fluctuates. When queen repopulation is not needed workerpolicing helps to prevent female egg-layers through [[Oophagy|egg-eating]] and aggressive behaviors.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>

==Interaction with other species==

===Diet===

The wasps forage for sugary substances o feed to both larvae and adult wasps.<ref name=\"Elisei 2005\"/> Additionally, [[necrophagy]] is a common practice for swarm-founding Neotropical bees and wasps, and one species that practices this is ''S. cyanea''.<ref name=\"O'Donnell 1995\">{{cite journal

===Defense===

Characteristic to the genus, ''S. cyanea'' will sound an alarm when disturbed.<ref name=\"Mortari 2012\"/> This sound is made when the wasps scrape their mandibles on the carton of their nest.<ref name=\"O'Donnell 1997\">{{cite journal

 | pmid=343706}}</ref>

==Human importance==

===Venom===

''S. cyanea'' venom is strong enough to cause [[haemolytic]] activity. [[Rhabdomyolysis]] and hemorrhage may also occur. In mice, abdominal spasms, ataxia, defecation, dyspnoea, hyperactivity, hypoactivity, sweating, and throes were observed following venom injection. ''S. cyanea'' venom also contains some antibacterial activity.<ref name=\"Mortari 2012\"/>

===Bites{{clarify|date=September 2017}} and stings===

Human accidents with wasps can occur one of two ways. Either a human may receive no more than one or two stings, or a swarm may attack a human. Symptoms following the attack can range from inflammatory reactions to severe allergic reactions resulting in anaphylactic shock. In some cases, death may occur following several bites{{clarify|date=September 2017}}<!--why should bites be significant?--> and a large amount of venom injection; however, a wasp sting typically will not produce a reaction more severe than local symptoms that affect only the skin.<ref name=\"Mortari 2012\"/>

=== Biocontrol Agent ===
In Brazil, the fruit fly, ''Zaprionus indianus'', is a common pest species that inflicts damage to multiple types of fruit trees. Since ''S. cyanea ''may obtain many nutrients from these fruit trees, researchers have observed the predatory nature of these wasps on ''Z. indianus''. When ''S. cyanea'' detect the fruit fly larvae, they soften, remove, and transport them back to the colony. For this reason, many fruit farmers consider ''S. cyanea'' a prospective candidate for use in pest management.<ref>{{Cite journal|url =http://journals.fcla.edu/flaent/article/view/82345 |title = Predation of Zaprinus indianus (Diptera: Drosophilidae) by the Social Wasp Synoeca cyanea (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)|last = Prezoto|first = Fabio|date = 2013|journal = Florida Entomologist|accessdate = |doi = 10.1653/024.096.0243|pmid = |volume = 96|pages = 670–672|issue = 2|doi-access = free}}</ref>

'''''Dean Spanley''''' is a 2008 British comedy drama film, with [[fantasy|fantastic]] elements, from [[Miramax]], Atlantic Film Group (UK) and General Film Corporation (NZ), directed by Fijian New Zealander [[Toa Fraser]]. Set in Edwardian England, the film is based on an [[Alan Sharp]] adaptation of Irish author [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]]'s 1936 novella ''My Talks with Dean Spanley''. It stars [[Sam Neill]] as the Dean, [[Jeremy Northam]] and [[Peter O'Toole]] as Fisk Junior and Fisk Senior respectively and [[Bryan Brown]] as Wrather.

==Plot==
The narrative is called \"a surreal period comedic tale of canine reincarnation exploring the relationships between father and son and master and dog\".<ref>[http://www.villagefilmfestival.co.uk/films/deanspanley.html Village Film Festival]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Peter O'Toole said that the film's use of comedy to explore the relationship between a father and son was part of the attraction for him: \"All of us have had these difficult familial relationships and I think it's a film for all of us who understand the relationship between a father and son. It's been interesting watching how various members of the crew have been looking at the monitors during scenes, because they come up to me and say, 'I had the same thing with my father.'\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Storyline===
In the very early 1900s, Henslowe Fisk lives beholden to his father, the difficult Horatio Fisk. The Fisk family has suffered first the loss of its younger son, Harrington Fisk (Xavier Horan), killed in the [[Second Anglo-Boer War]], shortly followed by the death of Horatio's wife. Fisk Senior is looked after by his housekeeper Mrs Brimley ([[Judy Parfitt]]) who has lost her husband. Fisk Junior reluctantly visits his father every Thursday.

One day, trying to entertain his father, Fisk Junior takes him to a lecture by a visiting [[swami]] ([[Art Malik]]) about the [[transmigration of the soul|transmigration]] of souls. The lecture is also attended by the new local clergyman, Dean Spanley ([[Sam Neill]]).

Later the same day Fisk Junior encounters the Dean at his father's club. A chance third meeting leads to an introduction. Fisk Junior, initially intrigued by the Dean's oddly open-minded views on reincarnation, is prompted to look beyond the Dean's appearance (that of an affable, rather bland clergyman) by his weakness for certain peculiar sensations produced by Hungarian Imperial [[Tokaji|Tokay]] wine, which leads him into a dreamlike state. Working with his clever friend Wrather ([[Bryan Brown]]), an Australian \"[[conveyancer]]\", Fisk secures a batch of Tokay and the two entertain the Dean, who acts ever more strangely, starting to reveal memories of his previous life — as a [[Welsh Springer Spaniel|Welsh Spaniel]]. These memories are acute and convincing, including rich feelings around food and communication with other canines, a deep distaste for cats and pigs, and the joy of serving his master. As the story unfolds, Fisk Junior comes to understand his father's background better and the two draw closer. There is a sub-plot concerning Fisk Senior's childhood that receives an unexpected resolution forming the climax of the story.

It also had two showings at the [[London Film Festival]], and was also shown at the largest film festival in Asia, the Pusan International.

The United Kingdom general release <!-- (probably limited) --> was announced by Icon Distribution for 12 December, and a \"U\" classification issued by the [[BBFC|British Board of Film Classification]].<ref>{{cite web|title=DEAN SPANLEY rated U by the BBFC |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/website/Classified.nsf/0/6CC6B797B204E928802574EB0057589C?OpenDocument |work=[[BBFC|British Board of Film Classification]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320100106/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/website/Classified.nsf/0/6CC6B797B204E928802574EB0057589C?OpenDocument |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>
In [[The Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] it was certified \"G\" and was released on the same date. The film was certified in Australia as \"G\" also, and was released 5 March 2009, and in New Zealand 26 February 2009; distribution in both Australia and New Zealand was by Paramount.

In early November, the film was offered to United States distributors at the annual ''American Film Market'' (5–12 November), with two showings announced, and in early February 2009, Miramax bought the United States rights.<ref>[http://www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=43106&Category= Miramax buys US rights to Dean Spanley]</ref> However, rather than opening in theatres in the U.S., it went straight to cable.

{{Anchor|DVD|Video}}
A region-2 DVD was released in 2009.<ref>{{cite video |title=Dean Spanley |medium=DVD |date=27 April 2009 |publisher=Icon Home Entertainment |url=http://www.iconmovies.co.uk/dean_spanley/}}</ref> A region-1 DVD was released in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dean Spanley |url=https://www.amazon.com/Dean-Spanley-Angela-Clerkin/dp/B0042U23A4/ |work=amazon.com}}</ref>

The novella, out of print for some years, was re-issued from [[HarperCollins]] in 2008. It included the film screenplay, set photos, publicity stills and interviews and comments from the cast, director, producers and crew members.

=== Critical response ===
{{Anchor|Critics}}
Receiving a standing ovation at the gala premiere, initial commentary was positive (per reviews at IMDb.com and elsewhere), with particular praise for O'Toole's performance and the final \"act\".

Reviews were generally positive, [[Rotten Tomatoes]] website gives the film a rating of 85% \"fresh\" based on 26 reviews. The critical consensus describes the film as \"Offbeat, whimsical, period-set [[shaggy dog story]] with daffy performances from Sam Neill and Peter O’Toole.\"<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dean_spanley/ Rotten Tomatoes: ''Dean Spanley''] Accessed 10 May 2010</ref>

Set in Edwardian England, the film is based on an [[Alan Sharp]] adaptation of Irish author [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]]'s 1936 novella ''My Talks with Dean Spanley''. It stars [[Sam Neill]] as the Dean, [[Jeremy Northam]] and [[Peter O'Toole]] as Fisk Junior and Fisk Senior respectively and [[Bryan Brown]] as Wrather.

==Plot==
The narrative is called \"a surreal period comedic tale of canine reincarnation exploring the relationships between father and son and master and dog\".<ref>[http://www.villagefilmfestival.co.uk/films/deanspanley.html Village Film Festival]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Peter O'Toole said that the film's use of comedy to explore the relationship between a father and son was part of the attraction for him: \"All of us have had these difficult familial relationships and I think it's a film for all of us who understand the relationship between a father and son. It's been interesting watching how various members of the crew have been looking at the monitors during scenes, because they come up to me and say, 'I had the same thing with my father.'\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Storyline===
In the very early 1900s, Henslowe Fisk lives beholden to his father, the difficult Horatio Fisk. The Fisk family has suffered first the loss of its younger son, Harrington Fisk (Xavier Horan), killed in the [[Second Anglo-Boer War]], shortly followed by the death of Horatio's wife. Fisk Senior is looked after by his housekeeper Mrs Brimley ([[Judy Parfitt]]) who has lost her husband. Fisk Junior reluctantly visits his father every Thursday.

One day, trying to entertain his father, Fisk Junior takes him to a lecture by a visiting [[swami]] ([[Art Malik]]) about the [[transmigration of the soul|transmigration]] of souls. The lecture is also attended by the new local clergyman, Dean Spanley ([[Sam Neill]]).

Later the same day Fisk Junior encounters the Dean at his father's club. A chance third meeting leads to an introduction. Fisk Junior, initially intrigued by the Dean's oddly open-minded views on reincarnation, is prompted to look beyond the Dean's appearance (that of an affable, rather bland clergyman) by his weakness for certain peculiar sensations produced by Hungarian Imperial [[Tokaji|Tokay]] wine, which leads him into a dreamlike state. Working with his clever friend Wrather ([[Bryan Brown]]), an Australian \"[[conveyancer]]\", Fisk secures a batch of Tokay and the two entertain the Dean, who acts ever more strangely, starting to reveal memories of his previous life — as a [[Welsh Springer Spaniel|Welsh Spaniel]]. These memories are acute and convincing, including rich feelings around food and communication with other canines, a deep distaste for cats and pigs, and the joy of serving his master. As the story unfolds, Fisk Junior comes to understand his father's background better and the two draw closer. There is a sub-plot concerning Fisk Senior's childhood that receives an unexpected resolution forming the climax of the story.

'''''Little Giants''''' is a 1994 [[United States of America|American]] [[family film|family]] [[sports film|sports]] [[comedy film]], starring [[Rick Moranis]] and [[Ed O'Neill]] as brothers in a small [[Ohio]] town, coaching rival [[Pee-Wee Football]] teams.<ref>{{cite news|author=Judy Brennan |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-21/entertainment/ca-29582_1_director-duwayne-dunham |title=PEEWEES' PLAYHOUSE : New Quarterback Takes 'Little Giants' Toward Goal - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=August 21, 1994 |access-date=July 16, 2012}}</ref>

==Plot==
Danny O'Shea has always lived in the shadow of his older brother, Kevin, a [[Heisman Trophy]] winner and a local football hero. They live in their hometown of Urbania, [[Ohio]]. Kevin coaches the local \"Pee-Wee Cowboys\" football team.  Despite being the best player, Danny's tomboy daughter, Becky, nicknamed Icebox, is cut during try outs because she is a girl. Also cut are her less-talented friends, Rashid Hanon (who can't catch anything), Tad Simpson (who can't run), and Rudy Zolteck (who's overweight and quite [[flatulence|flatulent]]). After being ridiculed by the players who made the team, she convinces her dad to coach a new pee-wee team of their own.

At first, Danny is reluctant to do so, but later accepts in an attempt to show Urbania that Kevin is not invincible, and that there is another O'Shea in town capable of winning. Kevin mockingly reminds him of the \"one town, one team\" rule and with the help of the locals, they decide to have a playoff game to determine the lone team that will represent Urbania. Alongside Becky, Hanon, Tad, Rudy, and Nubie (an intelligent boy who becomes assistant coach), Danny also gathers other children that have never been given a chance and dubs the team the \"Little Giants.\" One such player is Junior Floyd, a strong-armed quarterback who turns out to be the son of Danny's childhood crush, Patty Floyd. Becky slowly develops a crush on him and struggles with her newfound feelings as a girl.

Two local old-timers, Orville and Wilbur, encourage the rivalry between Danny and Kevin by reporting to them that a new star player, Spike Hammersmith, has just moved to Urbania. Danny succeeds at recruiting him by tricking his overzealous father, Mike, that he is the famous \"Coach O'Shea\", but Spike proves to be rude, arrogant, and refuses to play on a team with a girl. The deception is later discovered and he switches over to Kevin's more well-structured team. Kevin also encourages his daughter, Debbie, to become a cheerleader and later convinces Becky that a quarterback will want to date a cheerleader, not a teammate. Believing it is her best chance to win over Junior, she decides to quit the team and pursue cheerleading.

Just as Danny's team start to lose hope, a bus arrives carrying NFL stars [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]], [[Emmitt Smith]], [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]], [[Tim Brown (American football)|Tim Brown]], and [[Steve Emtman]]. They teach and inspire the young players into believing they can win.

On the day of the game, Kevin goads Danny into making an impulsive bet: If Danny wins, he gets Kevin's Chevrolet dealership; if Kevin wins, he gets Danny's gas station. Facing a 21-point halftime deficit, the Giants are lifted when Danny asks them to individually recall a time when they had a proud accomplishment and reassures them that all it takes is \"one time\" to beat the Cowboys. With this, they begin to make a big comeback with a series of outstanding and unexpected plays. Realizing that Junior is the main threat to them, Spike, under orders from his father, injures him by spearing him with his helmet after the whistle, which even Kevin considers disgraceful, unsportsmanlike conduct. 

Witnessing from the sidelines, an enraged Becky drops her pompoms and suits up for the game. She immediately makes an impact when she forces a fumble after a jarring hit on Spike. Other Giants make touchdowns in tandem with overcoming personal problems, such as Hanon's fear of dropping passes and making a reception, or another one running towards the end zone in excitement when he sees his little-seen dad has rushed back from a business trip to watch him play. In the game's closing seconds with the score tied at 21 all, the Giants make a goal line stand when Becky stops Spike. With time remaining for one final play, their offense steps back onto the field and uses a trick play Nubie calls \"[[Fumblerooski|The Annexation of Puerto Rico]],\" inspired by one of Madden's plays at [[Super Bowl XI]]. Kevin shouts out its actual name as it occurs, shouting \"Fumblerooski, Fumblerooski!\" The play includes three different ball carriers, utilizing the [[hook and lateral]] from Zolteck, to Junior, and finally to Berman, who scores the Giants' 99 yard game-winning touchdown.

Afterwards, Danny suggests that rather than having the Giants solely represent Urbania, they should merge with the Cowboys, and both he and Kevin can coach the team. Danny and Patty rekindle their childhood romance. He also decides not to hold Kevin to the prior bet, on the stipulation that the town water tower be changed from \"Home of Kevin O'Shea\" to \"Home of The O'Shea Brothers,\" reflecting a much earlier promise that Kevin made to Danny from their childhood.

==Production==
The film was inspired by a 1992 [[McDonald's]] [[Super Bowl]] commercial developed by Jim Ferguson and Bob Shallcross.  According to the [[Baltimore Sun]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-10-21/sports/1994294138_1_steven-spielberg-wee-football-jim | work=Baltimore Sun | title='Little Giants' a big hit not to be written off | date=1994-10-21}}</ref> after seeing the commercial, [[Steven Spielberg]] contacted them and said, \"I want that commercial made into a movie.

==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews. [[Stephen Holden]] remarked, in ''[[The New York Times]]'', that \"anyone who was ever rejected or picked last for a team can relate to the concept behind \"Little Giants,\" a slickly contrived family movie about an inept junior football team that succeeds in spite of spectacular liabilities [...]\"Little Giants,\" which was directed by Duwayne Dunham, devotes much of its energy to such comic antics as balls getting stuck into face masks, and wispy little kids practicing looking intimidating.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B05EFD8143CF937A25753C1A962958260|title=Little Giants (1994) FILM REVIEW; Extra Points For Trying|publisher=Movies.nytimes.com|accessdate=2012-07-16|first=Stephen|last=Holden|date=1994-10-14}}</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated that \"if \"Little Giants\" were in a beauty pageant it might win votes for Miss Congeniality, but it definitely wouldn't take the crown.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/littlegiantspghinson_a0a859.htm |title=‘Little Giants’ (PG) |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=1994-10-17 |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref> Conversely, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' suggested that the film was \"smarter than many of its ilk.

Kevin mockingly reminds him of the \"one town, one team\" rule and with the help of the locals, they decide to have a playoff game to determine the lone team that will represent Urbania. Alongside Becky, Hanon, Tad, Rudy, and Nubie (an intelligent boy who becomes assistant coach), Danny also gathers other children that have never been given a chance and dubs the team the \"Little Giants.\" One such player is Junior Floyd, a strong-armed quarterback who turns out to be the son of Danny's childhood crush, Patty Floyd. Becky slowly develops a crush on him and struggles with her newfound feelings as a girl.

Two local old-timers, Orville and Wilbur, encourage the rivalry between Danny and Kevin by reporting to them that a new star player, Spike Hammersmith, has just moved to Urbania. Danny succeeds at recruiting him by tricking his overzealous father, Mike, that he is the famous \"Coach O'Shea\", but Spike proves to be rude, arrogant, and refuses to play on a team with a girl. The deception is later discovered and he switches over to Kevin's more well-structured team. Kevin also encourages his daughter, Debbie, to become a cheerleader and later convinces Becky that a quarterback will want to date a cheerleader, not a teammate. Believing it is her best chance to win over Junior, she decides to quit the team and pursue cheerleading.

Just as Danny's team start to lose hope, a bus arrives carrying NFL stars [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]], [[Emmitt Smith]], [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]], [[Tim Brown (American football)|Tim Brown]], and [[Steve Emtman]]. They teach and inspire the young players into believing they can win.

On the day of the game, Kevin goads Danny into making an impulsive bet: If Danny wins, he gets Kevin's Chevrolet dealership; if Kevin wins, he gets Danny's gas station. Facing a 21-point halftime deficit, the Giants are lifted when Danny asks them to individually recall a time when they had a proud accomplishment and reassures them that all it takes is \"one time\" to beat the Cowboys. With this, they begin to make a big comeback with a series of outstanding and unexpected plays. Realizing that Junior is the main threat to them, Spike, under orders from his father, injures him by spearing him with his helmet after the whistle, which even Kevin considers disgraceful, unsportsmanlike conduct. 

Witnessing from the sidelines, an enraged Becky drops her pompoms and suits up for the game. She immediately makes an impact when she forces a fumble after a jarring hit on Spike. Other Giants make touchdowns in tandem with overcoming personal problems, such as Hanon's fear of dropping passes and making a reception, or another one running towards the end zone in excitement when he sees his little-seen dad has rushed back from a business trip to watch him play. In the game's closing seconds with the score tied at 21 all, the Giants make a goal line stand when Becky stops Spike. With time remaining for one final play, their offense steps back onto the field and uses a trick play Nubie calls \"[[Fumblerooski|The Annexation of Puerto Rico]],\" inspired by one of Madden's plays at [[Super Bowl XI]]. Kevin shouts out its actual name as it occurs, shouting \"Fumblerooski, Fumblerooski!\" The play includes three different ball carriers, utilizing the [[hook and lateral]] from Zolteck, to Junior, and finally to Berman, who scores the Giants' 99 yard game-winning touchdown.

Afterwards, Danny suggests that rather than having the Giants solely represent Urbania, they should merge with the Cowboys, and both he and Kevin can coach the team. Danny and Patty rekindle their childhood romance. He also decides not to hold Kevin to the prior bet, on the stipulation that the town water tower be changed from \"Home of Kevin O'Shea\" to \"Home of The O'Shea Brothers,\" reflecting a much earlier promise that Kevin made to Danny from their childhood.

==Production==
The film was inspired by a 1992 [[McDonald's]] [[Super Bowl]] commercial developed by Jim Ferguson and Bob Shallcross.  According to the [[Baltimore Sun]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-10-21/sports/1994294138_1_steven-spielberg-wee-football-jim | work=Baltimore Sun | title='Little Giants' a big hit not to be written off | date=1994-10-21}}</ref>, after seeing the commercial, [[Steven Spielberg]] contacted them and said, \"I want that commercial made into a movie.

==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews. [[Stephen Holden]] remarked, in ''[[The New York Times]]'', that \"anyone who was ever rejected or picked last for a team can relate to the concept behind \"Little Giants,\" a slickly contrived family movie about an inept junior football team that succeeds in spite of spectacular liabilities [...]\"Little Giants,\" which was directed by Duwayne Dunham, devotes much of its energy to such comic antics as balls getting stuck into face masks, and wispy little kids practicing looking intimidating.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B05EFD8143CF937A25753C1A962958260|title=Little Giants (1994) FILM REVIEW; Extra Points For Trying|publisher=Movies.nytimes.com|accessdate=2012-07-16|first=Stephen|last=Holden|date=1994-10-14}}</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated that \"if \"Little Giants\" were in a beauty pageant it might win votes for Miss Congeniality, but it definitely wouldn't take the crown.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/littlegiantspghinson_a0a859.htm |title=‘Little Giants’ (PG) |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=1994-10-17 |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref> Conversely, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' suggested that the film was \"smarter than many of its ilk.

The ghetto was liquidated on July 13, 1942. Only a handful of Jews managed to escape deportation. 

== Background ==
{{Further|Jewish ghettos in Europe}}

The city of Równe was the largest agglomeration in the province of [[Wołyń Voivodeship (1921–1939)#Administrative%20divisions|Volhynia (Wołyń)]] of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. About 25,000 Jews lived in Równe, [[Wołyń Voivodeship (1921–1939)|Wołyń Voivodeship]] in 1937.<ref name=\"Megargee\" /> The town was a center for Jewish education with many Jewish schools including a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] religious school ([[yeshiva]]).<ref>YIVO, [http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/rivne Rivne.] Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe.</ref>

Located in the south-eastern region of [[Kresy]], about {{convert|80|km}} west of the interwar border between Poland and the Soviet Union, Równe was occupied by the Red Army upon the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] on September 17, 1939 and incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]].<ref name=\"Teicher\">{{cite web| title=Rivne History |at=Alternate names: Rovne (ואװנע) [Yid]; Rivne (Рiвне) [Ukr]; Rovno (Ровно) [Rus]; Równe [Pol] |publisher=JewishGen, Inc. |url=https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/rovno/town.asp |date=2012 |first=Leah |last=Teicher |id=[https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/rovno/holocaust.asp The Równe Ghetto survivors & descendants; with maps and photographs of the 2012 Równe visit]}}</ref>  

When [[Wehrmacht|German troops]] invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the city fell to the Wehrmacht on June 28, 1941. On August 20, 1941, Rovno was declared the capital of German ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]''. The [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe|Jewish ghetto]] in the city of Rovno was set up by the German administration soon after the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]] was formed.<ref>Jewish Telegraphic Agency (February 8, 1942), [http://www.jta.org/1942/02/08/archive/all-jews-expelled-from-zgierz-nazis-introduce-ghetto-for-jews-in-rovno All Jews Expelled from Zgierz; Nazis Introduce Ghetto for Jews in Rovno.]</ref>

At the beginning of the German occupation, around 23,000<ref name=\"Megargee\" /> [[Polish Jews]] resided in Rovno along with refugees from western Poland,{{r|Altman}} which made up half the population of the city.<ref>Yad Vashem (2012), [https://web.archive.org/web/20120413112512/http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/stories/historical_background/volhynia_dubno.asp Volhynia and Rovno. Historical Background,] via Internet Archive.</ref>

When the Nazis captured the city from the Soviets, they carried out several executions of its Jewish population in order to inflict terror and fear for the sake of coercion.

== Creation and liquidation ==
The ghetto or \"Jewish residential area\" was created in December 1941.<ref name=\"Megargee\" /> It was an open ghetto<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/types-of-ghettos|title=Types of Ghettos|website=encyclopedia.ushmm.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> created in the Wola neighborhood, on the edge of Rovno.<ref name=\"Altman\" /> 5 200 Jews initially lived there.<ref name=\"Megargee\" /> The destruction of the Jewish people of Rovno occurred in three phases. <ref name=\"Burds\" />

# About 3,000-4,000 Jews were killed in July and August. On 9 and 12 July 1941, the ''[[Einsatzkommando#Einsatzgruppe C|Einsatzkommando 4A]]'' of ''[[Einsatzgruppe C]],'' a [[death squad]], shot 240 Jews; in the official German report, the victims were dubbed 'Bolshevik agents' and 'Jewish functionaries'. On August 6, [[Order Police battalions]] conducted a second campaign in Rovno, in the course of which about 300 Jews were shot.
# The most bloody shooting took place on November 6–7, 1941, whereas 15,000-18,000 adult Jews were killed by the Germans with the assistance of [[Ukrainian Auxiliary Police]] and members of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]] in the Sosenki forest near Rovno ('Sosenki' which means 'Little Pine Trees' in Polish). Jews were shot by [[Police Battalion 320]] in coordination with the ''[[Einsatzgruppe]]'' 5th Division.<ref>{{harvp|Burds|2013|loc=pp. 22, 49 (39, 57 of 151 in PDF).}}</ref> 6,000 children were also executed at a killing site close to the adult one.<ref name=\"Burds\" /> 
# The ghetto was liquidated in July 1942. On the night of July 13, 1942 at 22:00, the liquidation of the ghetto was carried out when a \"shared\" division of the [[SS]] and Ukrainian police units surrounded the ghetto, positioned spotlights around it and turned them on. Brigade SS and Ukrainian police were divided into small groups, broke into houses and pushed the people out, herded them into a freight train which took them to [[Kostopol]] (or [[Prokhorovsky District|Prokhurov]]) where they were shot to death in small Aktionen.<ref name=\"Burds\" /> 5000 Jews were killed in this manner.<ref name=\"Altman\">{{cite journal|last=Altman|first=Nolan|date=January 2010|title=Równe (Rovno) Victims Killed in the Kostopol Forest|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/Holocaust/0217_Rovno_victims.html|publisher=JewishGen.org.

The ghetto was declared \"[[Judenfrei|Judenrein]]\" end July by the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Reichskommissar]] [[Erich Koch|Eric Koch]].<ref name=\"Burds\" />

The remaining 5,000 Jews who possessed  skills which enabled them to hold professions that were deemed essential to the administration of the occupation were taken away from their families and placed in the ghetto. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

It is estimated that 22,000-23,000 Jews were killed in Rovno.<ref name=\"Megargee\" />

On February 2, 1944 Rivne was liberated from German troops by  Soviet troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front during the Rovno-Lutsk operation.<ref>Askey, Nigel (2014), [http://www.operationbarbarossa.net/the-lutsk-rovno-dubno-lvov-border-battle/ The Lutsk-Rovno-Dubno-Lvov Border Battle.] OperationBarbarossa.net.</ref>

== Life in the Ghetto ==
The ghetto had a [[Judenrat]] which consisted of 12 people. The two men who were appointed to head the Judenrat were Moses and Jacob Bergman (Leon) Suharchuk. They both committed suicide at the end of 1941 because they did not want to follow the Nazis' demand to turn over a group of Jews.<ref name=\"Megargee\" /> The Jews living in the ghetto had to pay levies to the German authorities . In one operation to seize the money, the Jews were required to pay the German authorities the exact sum of 12 million Rubles. Also, the German authorities confiscated any gold, jewelry, furniture and clothing which remained in the Jews' possession. At the time of the operation, the Jews were selling clothes in order to get some food. The most valuable items were sent to Germany, the rest of them were given to German soldiers and Ukrainian policemen or they were sold to them for symbolic prices. In the ghetto numerous restrictions were imposed on the Jews, including the obligation to wear a distinctive sign.

== Resistance ==
Underground organizations operated in the ghetto and accumulated weapons. 

150 Jews were saved by an engineer working for the local [[Deutsche Reichsbahn|Reichsbahn]], [[Hermann Friedrich Graebe|Hermann Graebe,]] as the ghetto was being liquidated.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://ww2today.com/13th-july-1942-horror-of-the-liquidation-of-the-rovno-ghetto|title=Horror of the 'liquidation' of the Rovno ghetto|author=World War II today|year=2017|work=From the evidence of Hermann Graebe, during “The [[Einsatzgruppen Case]]”, Nuremburg, 1947|quote=Around 23,000 people were murdered shortly after the German invasion in June 1941.

The ghetto was liquidated on July 13, 1942. Only a handful of Jews managed to escape deportation. 

== Background ==
{{Further|Jewish ghettos in Europe}}

The city of Równe was the largest agglomeration in the province of [[Wołyń Voivodeship (1921–1939)#Administrative%20divisions|Volhynia (Wołyń)]] of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. About 25,000 Jews lived in Równe, [[Wołyń Voivodeship (1921–1939)|Wołyń Voivodeship]] in 1937.<ref name=\"Megargee\" /> The town was a center for Jewish education with many Jewish schools including a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] religious school ([[yeshiva]]).<ref>YIVO, [http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/rivne Rivne.] Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe.</ref>

Located in the south-eastern region of [[Kresy]], about {{convert|80|km}} west of the interwar border between Poland and the Soviet Union, Równe was occupied by the Red Army upon the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] on September 17, 1939 and incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]].<ref name=\"Teicher\">{{cite web| title=Rivne History |at=Alternate names: Rovne (ואװנע) [Yid]; Rivne (Рiвне) [Ukr]; Rovno (Ровно) [Rus]; Równe [Pol] |publisher=JewishGen, Inc. |url=https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/rovno/town.asp |date=2012 |first=Leah |last=Teicher |id=[https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/rovno/holocaust.asp The Równe Ghetto survivors & descendants; with maps and photographs of the 2012 Równe visit]}}</ref>  

When [[Wehrmacht|German troops]] invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the city fell to the Wehrmacht on June 28, 1941. On August 20, 1941, Rovno was declared the capital of German ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]''. The [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe|Jewish ghetto]] in the city of Rovno was set up by the German administration soon after the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]] was formed.<ref>Jewish Telegraphic Agency (February 8, 1942), [http://www.jta.org/1942/02/08/archive/all-jews-expelled-from-zgierz-nazis-introduce-ghetto-for-jews-in-rovno All Jews Expelled from Zgierz; Nazis Introduce Ghetto for Jews in Rovno.]</ref> <ref>{{cite book|author=Palgrave.com|url=https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781137388391|title=J.

When the Nazis captured the city from the Soviets, they carried out several executions of its Jewish population in order to inflict terror and fear for the sake of coercion.

== Creation and liquidation ==
The ghetto or \"Jewish residential area\" was created in December 1941.<ref name=\"Megargee\" /> It was an open ghetto<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/types-of-ghettos|title=Types of Ghettos|website=encyclopedia.ushmm.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> created in the Wola neighborhood, on the edge of Rovno.<ref name=\"Altman\" /> 5 200 Jews initially lived there.<ref name=\"Megargee\" /> The destruction of the Jewish people of Rovno occurred in three phases. <ref name=\"Burds\" />

# About 3,000-4,000 Jews were killed in July and August. On 9 and 12 July 1941, the ''[[Einsatzkommando#Einsatzgruppe C|Einsatzkommando 4A]]'' of ''[[Einsatzgruppe C]],'' a [[death squad]], shot 240 Jews; in the official German report, the victims were dubbed 'Bolshevik agents' and 'Jewish functionaries'. On August 6, [[Order Police battalions]] conducted a second campaign in Rovno, in the course of which about 300 Jews were shot.
# The most bloody shooting took place on November 6–7, 1941, whereas 15,000-18,000 adult Jews were killed by the Germans with the assistance of [[Ukrainian Auxiliary Police]] and members of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]] in the Sosenki forest near Rovno ('Sosenki' which means 'Little Pine Trees' in Polish). Jews were shot by [[Police Battalion 320]] in coordination with the ''[[Einsatzgruppe]]'' 5th Division.<ref>{{harvp|Burds|2013|loc=pp. 22, 49 (39, 57 of 151 in PDF).}}</ref> 6,000 children were also executed at a killing site close to the adult one.<ref name=\"Burds\" /> 
# The ghetto was liquidated in July 1942. On the night of July 13, 1942 at 22:00, the liquidation of the ghetto was carried out when a \"shared\" division of the [[SS]] and Ukrainian police units surrounded the ghetto, positioned spotlights around it and turned them on. Brigade SS and Ukrainian police were divided into small groups, broke into houses and pushed the people out, herded them into a freight train which took them to [[Kostopol]] (or [[Prokhorovsky District|Prokhurov]]) where they were shot to death in small Aktionen.<ref name=\"Burds\" /> 5000 Jews were killed in this manner.<ref name=\"Altman\">{{cite journal|last=Altman|first=Nolan|date=January 2010|title=Równe (Rovno) Victims Killed in the Kostopol Forest|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/Holocaust/0217_Rovno_victims.html|publisher=JewishGen.org.

The ghetto was declared \"[[Judenfrei|Judenrein]]\" end July by the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Reichskommissar]] [[Erich Koch|Eric Koch]].<ref name=\"Burds\" />

The remaining 5,000 Jews who possessed  skills which enabled them to hold professions that were deemed essential to the administration of the occupation were taken away from their families and placed in the ghetto. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

It is estimated that 22,000-23,000 Jews were killed in Rovno.<ref name=\"Megargee\" />

On February 2, 1944 Rivne was liberated from German troops by  Soviet troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front during the Rovno-Lutsk operation.<ref>Askey, Nigel (2014), [http://www.operationbarbarossa.net/the-lutsk-rovno-dubno-lvov-border-battle/ The Lutsk-Rovno-Dubno-Lvov Border Battle.] OperationBarbarossa.net.</ref>

== Life in the Ghetto ==
The ghetto had a [[Judenrat]] which consisted of 12 people. The two men who were appointed to head the Judenrat were Moses and Jacob Bergman (Leon) Suharchuk. They both committed suicide at the end of 1941 because they did not want to follow the Nazis' demand to turn over a group of Jews.<ref name=\"Megargee\" /> The Jews living in the ghetto had to pay levies to the German authorities . In one operation to seize the money, the Jews were required to pay the German authorities the exact sum of 12 million Rubles. Also, the German authorities confiscated any gold, jewelry, furniture and clothing which remained in the Jews' possession. At the time of the operation, the Jews were selling clothes in order to get some food. The most valuable items were sent to Germany, the rest of them were given to German soldiers and Ukrainian policemen or they were sold to them for symbolic prices. In the ghetto numerous restrictions were imposed on the Jews, including the obligation to wear a distinctive sign.

== Resistance ==
Underground organizations operated in the ghetto and accumulated weapons. 

150 Jews were saved by an engineer working for the local [[Deutsche Reichsbahn|Reichsbahn]], [[Hermann Friedrich Graebe|Hermann Graebe,]] as the ghetto was being liquidated.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://ww2today.com/13th-july-1942-horror-of-the-liquidation-of-the-rovno-ghetto|title=Horror of the 'liquidation' of the Rovno ghetto|author=World War II today|year=2017|work=From the evidence of Hermann Graebe, during “The [[Einsatzgruppen Case]]”, Nuremburg, 1947|quote=Around 23,000 people were murdered shortly after the German invasion in June 1941.

'''Climate communication''' or '''climate change communication''' is a field of [[environmental communication]]s and [[science communication]] focused on facilitating the communications of the effects of [[Global warming|anthropogenic climate change]]. Most climate communication focuses on bringing knowledge from the scientific consensus on the impact of climate change to a broader public.

The field of climate communication explores two main areas: the efficacy of existing communications strategies, and supporting the development of recommendations for improving that communication. Improving climate change communication has become the focus of several major research institutes, such as the [[Yale Program on Climate Change Communication]] and Climate Outreach in the UK, as well as major international organizations, such as the IPCC and [[UN Climate Change Secretariat]], and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s.

== History ==
In her encyclopedia article in Oxford's Communications Research Encyclopedia, scholar Amy E. Chadwick describes Climate Change Communication as a new field emerging in the 1990s.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://oxfordre.com/communication/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228613-e-22|title=Climate Change Communication|last=Chadwick|first=Amy E.|date=2017-09-26|website=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Communication|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228613-e-22|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> Early studies were connected to other environmental communications concerns such as exploring awareness and understanding of [[ozone depletion]].<ref name=\":2\" /> {{As of|2017|}}, most research in this field has been conducted in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Western European countries.<ref name=\":2\" />

== Major issues ==

=== Barriers to understanding ===
Because of the importance of the larger scale [[Climate change mitigation|public action required in addressing climate change]], a significant part of climate communications is focused on understanding barriers to public understanding and action on climate change. In particular, the evidence shows that the [[information deficit model]] of communication—where climate change communicators assume  \"if the public only knew more about the evidence they would act\"—doesn't work. Instead, [[argumentation theory]] indicates that different audiences need different kinds of persuasive argumentation and communication.

Additionally, [[Climate change denial|climate denialism]] by organizations such as the [[The Heartland Institute]] in the United States, introduces [[misinformation]] into public discourse and understanding.

There are several models for explaining why the public doesn't act once more informed. One of the theoretical models for this is the 5 Ds model created by [[Per Espen Stoknes|Per Epsten Stoknes]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2015/04/03/the-5-psychological-barriers-t.html|title=The 5 psychological barriers to climate action|last=Stoknes|first=Per Espen|date=2015-04-03|website=Boing Boing|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Stokes describes 5 major barriers to creating action from climate communication:

# '''Distance''' - many effects and impacts of climate change feel distant from individual lives
# '''Doom -''' when framed as a disaster, the message backfires, causing [[Eco-anxiety]]
# '''Dissonance''' - a disconnect between the problems (mainly the fossil fuel economy) and the things that people choose in their lives
# '''Denial''' -- psychological self defense to avoid becoming overwhelmed by fear or guilt
# '''iDentity''' -- disconnects created by social identities, such as [[Conservatism|conservative]] values, which are threatened by the changes that need to happen because of climate change.

=== Creating change ===
As of 2008, most of the environmental communications evidence for effecting individual or social change were focused on behavior changes around: [[Domestic energy consumption|household energy consumption]], [[Recycling|recycling behaviours]], changing transportation behavior and buying green products.<ref name=\":1\" /> At that time, there were few examples of [[multi-level communications]] strategies for effecting change.<ref name=\":1\" />

=== Audience Segmentation ===

Different parts of different populations respond differently to climate change communication. Academic research since 2013 has seen an increasing number of [[audience segmentation]] studies, to understand different tactics for reaching different parts of populations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hine|first=Donald W|last2=Reser|first2=Joseph P|last3=Morrison|first3=Mark|last4=Phillips|first4=Wendy J|last5=Nunn|first5=Patrick|last6=Cooksey|first6=Ray|date=July 2014|title=Audience segmentation and climate change communication: conceptual and methodological considerations: Audience segmentation and climate change communication|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/wcc.279|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change|volume=5|issue=4|pages=441–459|doi=10.1002/wcc.279}}</ref> Major segmentation studies include:

=== Changing Rhetoric ===
A significant part of the research and public advocacy conversations about climate change have focused on the effectiveness of different terms used to describe \"global warming\".

==== History of &quot;Global Warming&quot; ====
{{Excerpt|Global_warming|Terminology}}

=== Health ===
{{Main|Climate change and health}}Climate change exacerbates a number of existing public health issues, such as [[mosquito-borne disease]], and introduces new public health concerns related to changing climate, such as increase in health concerns after natural disasters or increases in [[heat illness]]es. Thus the field of [[health communication]] has long acknowledged the importance of treating climate change as a public health issue, requiring broad population behavior changes that allow societal [[climate change adaptation]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Maibach|first=Edward W.|last2=Roser-Renouf|first2=Connie|last3=Leiserowitz|first3=Anthony|date=November 2008|title=Communication and Marketing As Climate Change–Intervention Assets|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0749379708006818|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|language=en|volume=35|issue=5|pages=488–500|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2008.08.016}}</ref> A December 2008 article in the [[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]] recommended using two broad sets of tools to effect this change: communication and [[social marketing]].<ref name=\":0\" />

=== Media coverage ===
{{Main|Media coverage of global warming}}
The effect of mass media and journalism on the public's attitudes towards climate change has been a significant part of communications studies. In particular, scholars have looked at how the media's tendency to cover climate change in different cultural contexts, with different audiences or political positions (for example [[Fox News]]'s dismissive coverage of climate change news), and the tendency of newsrooms to cover climate change as a issue of uncertainty or debate, in order to give a sense of balance.<ref name=\":2\" /> 

=== Popular culture ===
{{Main|Global warming in popular culture}}
Further research has explored how popular media, like the film ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'' and popular documentary [[An Inconvenient Truth]] change public perceptions of climate change.<ref name=\":2\" />

== Effective climate communication ==
Effective climate communications require audience and contextual awareness. Different organizations have published guides and frameworks based on experience in climate communications. This section documents those various guidelines.

=== By experts ===
The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] published a handbook of guidance for IPCC authors about effective climate communication. It is based on extensive social studies research exploring the impact of different tactics for climate communication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://climateoutreach.org/resources/ipcc-communications-handbook/|title=Communications Handbook for IPCC scientists|last=|first=|date=January 30, 2018|website=Climate Outreach|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> The guidelines focus on six main principles:

# Be a confident communicator 
# Talk about the real world, not abstract ideas
# Connect with what matters to your audience 
# Tell a human story 
# Lead  with what you know 
# Use the most effective visual communication

=== Visuals ===
Climate Visuals a nonprofit, publishes a set of guidelines based on evidence for climate communications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://climatevisuals.org/evidence-behind-climate-visuals|title=The evidence behind Climate Visuals|website=Climate Visuals|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> They recommend that visual communications include:

# Show real people 
# Tell new stories 
# Show climate change causes at scale 
# Show emotionally powerful impacts 
# Understand your audience 
# Show local (serious) impacts 
# Be careful with protest imagery.

=== Sustainable development ===
The impacts of climate change are exacerbated in low- and middle income countries; higher levels of poverty, less access to technologies, and less education, means that this audience needs different information. The [[Paris Agreement]] and [[IPCC]] both acknowledge the importance of [[sustainable development]] in addressing these differences. Non profit, [[Climate and Development Knowledge Network]] published a set of [[lessons learned]] and guidelines based on their experience communicating climate change in Latin America, Asia and Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdkn.org/resource/guide-communicating-climate-change-a-practitioners-guide/|title=GUIDE: Communicating climate change - A practitioner's guide|website=Climate and Development Knowledge Network|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>

== Important organizations ==
Major research centers in climate communication include:

* [[Yale Program on Climate Change Communication]]
* [[Center for Climate Change Communication]] at [[George Mason University]]

Academic research since 2013 has seen an increasing number of [[audience segmentation]] studies, to understand different tactics for reaching different parts of populations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hine|first=Donald W|last2=Reser|first2=Joseph P|last3=Morrison|first3=Mark|last4=Phillips|first4=Wendy J|last5=Nunn|first5=Patrick|last6=Cooksey|first6=Ray|date=July 2014|title=Audience segmentation and climate change communication: conceptual and methodological considerations: Audience segmentation and climate change communication|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/wcc.279|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change|volume=5|issue=4|pages=441–459|doi=10.1002/wcc.279}}</ref> Major segmentation studies include:

=== Changing Rhetoric ===
A significant part of the research and public advocacy conversations about climate change have focused on the effectiveness of different terms used to describe \"global warming\".

==== History of &quot;Global Warming&quot; ====
{{Excerpt|Global_warming|Terminology}}

=== Health ===
{{Main|Climate change and health}}Climate change exacerbates a number of existing public health issues, such as [[mosquito-borne disease]], and introduces new public health concerns related to changing climate, such as increase in health concerns after natural disasters or increases in [[heat illness]]es. Thus the field of [[health communication]] has long acknowledged the importance of treating climate change as a public health issue, requiring broad population behavior changes that allow societal [[climate change adaptation]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Maibach|first=Edward W.|last2=Roser-Renouf|first2=Connie|last3=Leiserowitz|first3=Anthony|date=November 2008|title=Communication and Marketing As Climate Change–Intervention Assets|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0749379708006818|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|language=en|volume=35|issue=5|pages=488–500|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2008.08.016}}</ref> A December 2008 article in the [[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]] recommended using two broad sets of tools to effect this change: communication and [[social marketing]].<ref name=\":0\" />

=== Media coverage ===
{{Main|Media coverage of global warming}}
The effect of mass media and journalism on the public's attitudes towards climate change has been a significant part of communications studies. In particular, scholars have looked at how the media's tendency to cover climate change in different cultural contexts, with different audiences or political positions (for example [[Fox News]]'s dismissive coverage of climate change news), and the tendency of newsrooms to cover climate change as a issue of uncertainty or debate, in order to give a sense of balance.<ref name=\":2\" /> 

=== Popular culture ===
{{Main|Global warming in popular culture}}
Further research has explored how popular media, like the film ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'' and popular documentary [[An Inconvenient Truth]] change public perceptions of climate change.<ref name=\":2\" />

== Effective climate communication ==
Effective climate communications require audience and contextual awareness. Different organizations have published guides and frameworks based on experience in climate communications. This section documents those various guidelines.

=== By experts ===
The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] published a handbook of guidance for IPCC authors about effective climate communication. It is based on extensive social studies research exploring the impact of different tactics for climate communication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://climateoutreach.org/resources/ipcc-communications-handbook/|title=Communications Handbook for IPCC scientists|last=|first=|date=January 30, 2018|website=Climate Outreach|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> The guidelines focus on six main principles:

# Be a confident communicator 
# Talk about the real world, not abstract ideas
# Connect with what matters to your audience 
# Tell a human story 
# Lead  with what you know 
# Use the most effective visual communication

=== Visuals ===
Climate Visuals a nonprofit, publishes a set of guidelines based on evidence for climate communications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://climatevisuals.org/evidence-behind-climate-visuals|title=The evidence behind Climate Visuals|website=Climate Visuals|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> They recommend that visual communications include:

# Show real people 
# Tell new stories 
# Show climate change causes at scale 
# Show emotionally powerful impacts 
# Understand your audience 
# Show local (serious) impacts 
# Be careful with protest imagery.

=== Sustainable development ===
The impacts of climate change are exacerbated in low- and middle income countries; higher levels of poverty, less access to technologies, and less education, means that this audience needs different information. The [[Paris Agreement]] and [[IPCC]] both acknowledge the importance of [[sustainable development]] in addressing these differences. Non profit, [[Climate and Development Knowledge Network]] published a set of [[lessons learned]] and guidelines based on their experience communicating climate change in Latin America, Asia and Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdkn.org/resource/guide-communicating-climate-change-a-practitioners-guide/|title=GUIDE: Communicating climate change - A practitioner's guide|website=Climate and Development Knowledge Network|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>

== Important organizations ==
Major research centers in climate communication include:

* [[Yale Program on Climate Change Communication]]
* [[Center for Climate Change Communication]] at [[George Mason University]]

== Plot ==
{{Long plot|date=February 2017}}
Eleven years before the present day, Angelina D’Angelo rushes through the halls of the hospital stopping right in front of the nursery window to look at the newborns in the room. The parents of the children exchange stories and the Fitpatricks tell the Ellerbys that they are naming their son Leonard Fitzpatrick, after his great-grandfather. The Ellerbys exclaim that they are naming their daughter after her great-grandmother, Amanda Ellerby. Angelina predicts that the two children will be best friends and makes them promise they will celebrate this day together every year. A year later, on Amanda and Leo's first birthday, the Ellerbys and Fitpatricks are surprised to find themselves together again. It turns out that both families have been booked into the same birthday room at the Magic Castle Birthday Party Palace by mistake. They spend Amanda and Leo's birthday together, watching the two bond and even take their first steps together. The two children become friends.

The night before Amanda and Leo's 11th birthday, Amanda is busy practicing back handsprings with her friend Stephanie for the next day's gymnastics tryouts at school. The girls want to get on the team in order to become friends with the popular girls. Amanda's mother arrives home from work, and Amanda notices that her mother has sent Leo an invitation to her party and gets upset. She is still angry because she overheard Leo tell his friends that he thought it was stupid that he had to spend his birthday with a girl, but she doesn’t have many other friends so he wouldn’t want to tell her and hurt her feelings. After that Amanda refused to speak to Leo, locking away all of their pictures and even throwing the flowerpot that she had hand painted with Leo on their 5th birthday, along with the plant in it, out her window.

The day of Amanda tucker is awesome!!! and Leo's birthday does not go well for Amanda. She has to take the bus to school and forgets her lunch, and there is a pop quiz in class. She fails the gymnastics tryouts although Stephanie makes the team. When it comes time for her birthday party, most of her friends end up ditching in favor of Leo's. The night ends with her finding out that her mother has been fired from her job because she had mistakenly switched an important work presentation with her sister's science presentation. Amanda she goes to bed tired and disappointed. 

When Amanda wakes up the next morning it seems as if the whole day is playing out exactly like the day before. At first she believes everybody is playing a cruel joke but finally it dawns on her that it is the day of her birthday all over again. She does everything exactly the same as before, afraid to change any details. It's only when she's getting ready for her party she realizes that she is stuck in a time loop.

The following morning is exactly the same as the previous two days but this time Amanda decides to fake sick and stay home. Her neighbor takes her to the doctor where she lets slip something about an old family feud between the Ellerbys and the Fitzpatricks but she doesn’t know much about it, so Amanda doesn’t pursue it. Her party ends up being cancelled and she spends the night with her family. In the morning, Amanda realizes that she's still stuck on the same day. Frustrated and confused she goes to school but this time, while she's sitting in class, she sees Leo wink at her, which makes her realize the two of them are stuck in this time loop together.

Amanda is relieved the next morning when nobody remembers that they are angry with her and she is no longer grounded. She even remembers to remind her mom about taking the right presentation. At school, Amanda and Leo finally get the chance to talk. He apologizes to her for the things he said and tells her he only said them because he wanted to look cool in front of his friends. They both agree that they miss each other and become friends again and decide tomorrow they are going to skip school and go out since there will be no consequences the next day.

The next morning Amanda fakes sick and stays home. When her dad falls asleep, she sneaks out to meet up with Leo. Leo has the whole day planned and it starts with them going for breakfast where Leo orders lots of food he would never normally get to eat. He then leads her to an open mic poetry reading where he gets up in front of the crowd and reads some of his own poetry. Leo then proceeds to take Amanda to an audition for a band looking for a drummer. After much coaxing Amanda agrees to try out. The band members are impressed, but they tell her to come back when she is older. Exhilarated, the two finally head to the mall where security grabs them and turns them over to their families who are worried sick about them.

The day goes as it normally does but after school Amanda and Leo go visit the Senior Community Center and ask around about the family feud that Amanda's neighbor had previously mentioned. They find out that their grandfathers used to own competing apple groves and they would always do things to try and harm the others’ farm. Then, however, they suddenly made up for unknown reasons. Amanda and Leo still need more answers so they decide to go to the Willow Falls Historical Society the next day.

They go to the Willow Falls Historical Society where they find Angelina. She tells them that the town had sought the help of someone special who told the two men that they had to patch up their differences by the Harvest Day or else there would be consequences. Angelina claims she doesn’t know anymore and the only thing that would have more information would be a journal that was stolen a while ago. Amanda and Leo ultimately come back the next day to sneak into the historical society and look around for the journal because they think she actually stashed the journal somewhere in the place. They end up finding Leo's great-grandfather's journal instead which revealed that because they didn’t heed the woman's warning and patch things up within the year they went through a time loop as well until they resolved their differences and fixed all the damage they caused. Amanda and Leo are confused because they made up a week ago but they are still stuck. They decide to help everyone that they possibly can tomorrow in hopes that it will fix things. The next day, Amanda and Leo help everybody that they possibly can, such as reminding her mother about the presentation mix up, even though her mother still gets fired, suggesting that some things are meant to be. Amanda manages to make the gymnastics team. During their birthday parties they decide to merge them and both Leo and Amanda have high hopes they have broken the time loop.

In the morning, Amanda realizes that she is celebrating her birthday again for the 11th time. She is frustrated but when she gets on the bus she sees the Angelina is the bus driver and ultimately she gives her and Leo some answers. She reveals that she was the one who put the spell their great-grandfathers and was worried that it would transfer over to them. She insists that this shouldn’t have happened though because on their 5th birthday she gave them plants protecting them from the curse. As long as they had the plants close they shouldn’t have fallen into the time loop. Leo claims that's his is still sitting in his room but Amanda admits that she threw hers out the window a year ago on the night of their tenth birthday. Angelina makes them hurry back to class where everything goes as normal, except this time Amanda tries out for the marching band instead of the gymnastics team, something she secretly had wanted to do the whole time. When Amanda gets home from school she is relieved to find the plant still in the bushes under her window and she returns it back to its place in her bedroom. Both Amanda and Leo decide that they are just going to have one mom party together this time where they spend the night laughing together just like old times. To both Amanda and Leo's relief, the next morning is finally the day after their birthday. Amanda and Leo make a pact that they will always stay in touch with each other so that it won’t happen again.

== Reception and awards ==
''11 Birthdays'', was positively received by both the general public and critics. [[The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books]] published a review by Jeannette Hulick, which states that ''11 Birthdays'' “is imaginatively developed and kid-pleasing. The now-tenuous/now-tenacious quality of the book’s middle-grade friendships will ring true to its audience, and Amanda’s voice is likable and humorous.”<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hulick|first=Jeannette|date=2009|title=11 Birthdays (review)|journal=Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books|language=en|volume=62|issue=6|pages=247–248|doi=10.1353/bcc.0.0666|issn=1558-6766}}</ref> [[Publishers Weekly]] also states, “Like a [[Groundhog Day (film)|''Groundhog Day'']] for middle grade readers, Mass' winning story features a girl seemingly trapped in her 11th birthday. Amanda seems doomed to relive her failed try-out for the gymnastics team, her mother being fired from her job and, worst of all, the party that even her best friend leaves early—to go to the party hosted by her former friend, Leo. The two have celebrated every previous birthday together (they were born on the same day), but a misunderstanding on their 10th has gone unresolved. Girls will relate to Amanda’s insecurities, and the confidence and insights she gains will resonate with them. Mass’s expertise with pacing keeps the story moving at a lively clip, and her understanding of this age group is as finely honed as ever.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wendymass.com/books/11-birthdays/reviews/|title=Reviews - Wendy Mass|work=Wendy Mass|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-US}}</ref> ''11 Birthdays'' has been nominated for and received numerous awards, including the [[William Allen White Children's Book Award|William Allen White Award]] for grades 3-5 in 2012,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.emporia.edu/libsv/wawbookaward/winners/pastwinners.html|title=Past Winners - William Allen White Children's Book Awards {{!}} Emporia State University|website=www.emporia.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> and has been chosen a 2009 Library Guild Selection.<ref name=\":0\" />

She tells them that the town had sought the help of someone special who told the two men that they had to patch up their differences by the Harvest Day or else there would be consequences. Angelina claims she doesn’t know anymore and the only thing that would have more information would be a journal that was stolen a while ago. Amanda and Leo ultimately come back the next day to sneak into the historical society and look around for the journal because they think she actually stashed the journal somewhere in the place. They end up finding Leo's great-grandfather's journal instead which revealed that because they didn’t heed the woman's warning and patch things up within the year they went through a time loop as well until they resolved their differences and fixed all the damage they caused. Amanda and Leo are confused because they made up a week ago but they are still stuck. They decide to help everyone that they possibly can tomorrow in hopes that it will fix things. The next day, Amanda and Leo help everybody that they possibly can, such as reminding her mother about the presentation mix up, even though her mother still gets fired, suggesting that some things are meant to be. Amanda manages to make the gymnastics team. During their birthday parties they decide to merge them and both Leo and Amanda have high hopes they have broken the time loop.

In the morning, Amanda realizes that she is celebrating her birthday again for the 11th time. She is frustrated but when she gets on the bus she sees the Angelina is the bus driver and ultimately she gives her and Leo some answers. She reveals that she was the one who put the spell their great-grandfathers and was worried that it would transfer over to them. She insists that this shouldn’t have happened though because on their 5th birthday she gave them plants protecting them from the curse. As long as they had the plants close they shouldn’t have fallen into the time loop. Leo claims that's his is still sitting in his room but Amanda admits that she threw hers out the window a year ago on the night of their tenth birthday. Angelina makes them hurry back to class where everything goes as normal, except this time Amanda tries out for the marching band instead of the gymnastics team, something she secretly had wanted to do the whole time. When Amanda gets home from school she is relieved to find the plant still in the bushes under her window and she returns it back to its place in her bedroom. Both Amanda and Leo decide that they are just going to have one big party together this time where they spend the night laughing together just like old times. To both Amanda and Leo's relief, the next morning is finally the day after their birthday. Amanda and Leo make a pact that they will always stay in touch with each other so that it won’t happen again.

== Reception and awards ==
''11 Birthdays'', was positively received by both the general public and critics. [[The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books]] published a review by Jeannette Hulick, which states that ''11 Birthdays'' “is imaginatively developed and kid-pleasing. The now-tenuous/now-tenacious quality of the book’s middle-grade friendships will ring true to its audience, and Amanda’s voice is likable and humorous.”<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hulick|first=Jeannette|date=2009|title=11 Birthdays (review)|journal=Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books|language=en|volume=62|issue=6|pages=247–248|doi=10.1353/bcc.0.0666|issn=1558-6766}}</ref> [[Publishers Weekly]] also states, “Like a [[Groundhog Day (film)|''Groundhog Day'']] for middle grade readers, Mass' winning story features a girl seemingly trapped in her 11th birthday. Amanda seems doomed to relive her failed try-out for the gymnastics team, her mother being fired from her job and, worst of all, the party that even her best friend leaves early—to go to the party hosted by her former friend, Leo. The two have celebrated every previous birthday together (they were born on the same day), but a misunderstanding on their 10th has gone unresolved. Girls will relate to Amanda’s insecurities, and the confidence and insights she gains will resonate with them. Mass’s expertise with pacing keeps the story moving at a lively clip, and her understanding of this age group is as finely honed as ever.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wendymass.com/books/11-birthdays/reviews/|title=Reviews - Wendy Mass|work=Wendy Mass|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-US}}</ref> ''11 Birthdays'' has been nominated for and received numerous awards, including the [[William Allen White Children's Book Award|William Allen White Award]] for grades 3-5 in 2012,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.emporia.edu/libsv/wawbookaward/winners/pastwinners.html|title=Past Winners - William Allen White Children's Book Awards {{!}} Emporia State University|website=www.emporia.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> and has been chosen a 2009 Library Guild Selection.<ref name=\":0\" />

"",safe,Boooomer124,"The Labour Party dossier into antisemitism (officially entitled '''<nowiki/>'The work of the Labour Party's Governance and Legal Unit in relation to antisemitism, 2014-2019'''') is a leaked [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] document written by party staff in response to the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]]'s investigation into the party's handling of antisemitism complaints and includes reports of other forms of racism. The report reveals emails of senior party management staff, aligned with the right of the party, wherein there was clear obstruction of justice in dealing with cases of antisemitism and other noted cases of racism, and it does not clear the party of accusations of being 'institutionally antisemitic'. The report's main assertion is that rampant factionalism within the party had ultimately led to antisemitism and racism allegations not being dealt with properly.

The dossier was first reported by Tom Rayner, political correspondent at [[Sky News]], on Twitter where he reported that the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] lawyers had advised against submitting the report to the Commission.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RaynerSkyNews/status/1249053545837604864?s=20|title=Exclusive: Labour lawyers decide an 860-page dossier on failures to handle AS complaints, compiled in last months of Corbyn's leadership, should not be sent to the EHRC.

== Background ==
The Labour Party has been dealing with a rise in antisemitism complaints since the election of [[Jeremy Corbyn]] as leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45030552|title=A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims|date=2019-07-16|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-13|language=en-GB}}</ref> While complaints proceedings over antisemitism and other forms of racism and discrimination had existed prior to Corbyn's election as leader, over the course of his leadership they seemed to have increased and worsened.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1043524/labour-antisemitism-jeremy-corbyn-uk-antisemitism|title=Labour condemned for rise of antisemitism in UK - ‘Friends and neighbours are afraid’|last=Editor|first=David Maddox, Political|date=2018-11-10|website=Express.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> This has led to several serious issues in the party's approach to antisemitism and failure to deal with it, much of which is documented [[Antisemitism in the UK Labour Party|here]]. Much of the failings on dealing with antisemitism were associated with Corbyn's inaction<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/jeremy-corbyn-should-no-longer-get-benefit-of-the-doubt-over-rise-of-labour-antisemitism-1.473871|website=www.thejc.com|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>, however, this report lays bare the failings of former members of the senior leadership team, who opposed Corbyn's leadership, at the party's Head Office to take antisemitic complaints seriously.

== Report's contents ==
There are several figures from the senior management team implicated in obstructing justice in antisemitism complaints, using defamatory language against MPs, staff and members, and hindering Labour's chances of winning during elections. The key finding shows that the named figures had not taken disciplinary cases seriously and intended for it to reflect badly on the leader. There is a report of a senior governance executive \"fabricat[ing] a case\" against people \"she doesn't like\", and one staffer admitted that \"real work\" was \"piling up\" while they \"were engaged in inappropriate factional work\". In the period between November 2016 and February 2018 the figures named in the report, who were in charge of member disciplinary procedures, had only taken action on 16% of all complaints made about members engaging in antisemitism.

In addition to this, there are clear examples of the named figures using insulting, derogatory and aggressive language towards Labour politicians, staff and members. This includes terms like \"trots\", \"bitch face cow\", \"fucking twats\". They repeatedly used derogatory mental health tropes, including terms like \"mentalist\" and \"nutter\", and repeatedly disparaged the appearance of party staff and members, using terms like \"pube head\", \"smelly cow\" and \"fat\". They also made comments saying that that certain party members should \"die in a fire\" and that a senior aide's \"face would make a good dartboard\". Labour MPs were also targets as they said that those MPs who nominated Corbyn should be \"taken out and shot\" amongst other disparaging remarks. Labour politicians who were insulted in the comments were: [[Ed Miliband]], [[Sadiq Khan]], [[Dawn Butler]], [[Diane Abbott]], [[Rachael Maskell]], [[Clive Lewis (politician)|Clive Lewis]], and [[Jeremy Corbyn]]. They also expressed anti-black racism and sympathy towards Islamophobic tropes. 

There is also talk of violence against [[Jeremy Corbyn]]; talking about \"hanging and burning\" Corbyn, calling him a \"lying little toerag\", claiming \"death is too kind for LOTO ['Leader Of The Opposition']\". Senior management were found to be telling staff that they need not be \"comradely\" in their attitudes and statements about the leader.

There were constant talks of hoping Labour loses key elections in order to instigating a coup and remove Corbyn as leader. There were statements expressing that Labour should on the losing side for the [[2016 United Kingdom local elections|2016 local elections]] and [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union referendum]]. Furthermore, there is overwhelming evidence of the senior management obstructing party efforts to win the [[2017 United Kingdom general election]] in order to remove Corbyn. The management team co-ordinated in \"refusing to share basic information to LOTO during the election\", created a \"parallel general election campaign\" and boasted about \"hardly working\" during the campaign. There are marked statements about their dismay at Labour over-performing expectations during the campaign, and apparent disappointment with the increase in seats after the election.

# The contents and wider culture and practices referred to in the report. 
# Third, the circumstances in which the report was put into the public domain.

We have also asked for immediate sight of any legal advice the Labour Party has already received about the report. “n the meantime, we ask everyone concerned to refrain from drawing conclusions before the investigation is complete and we will be asking the GS to put measures in place to protect the welfare of party members and party staff who are concerned or affected by this report.\"</blockquote>

== Criticism ==
There were concerns about the privacy and welfare of the complainants named within the report. An unredacted version was being circulated on social media, which led to worries of Jewish activists that they would be targeted by antisemites for speaking up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2020/04/why-keir-starmers-response-leaked-party-report-anti-semitism-right-one|title=Why Keir Starmer's response to a leaked party report into anti-Semitism is the right one|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

The report was also criticised as being written to absolve the Corbyn leadership of the failure to deal with antisemitism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/antisemitism/status/1249285398783758342|title=Mammoth report by @UKLabour detailing anti- @jeremycorbyn conspiracy at Party’s HQ is “last ditch attempt to discredit #antisemitism allegations” and must be sent to EHRC

The reports findings prove the scale of the. problem, and could help end denialism amongst parts of the Party membership which has further hurt Jewish members and the Jewish community.\"

== Criticism ==
There were concerns about the privacy and welfare of the complainants named within the report. An unredacted version was being circulated on social media, which led to worries of Jewish activists that they would be targeted by antisemites for speaking up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2020/04/why-keir-starmers-response-leaked-party-report-anti-semitism-right-one|title=Why Keir Starmer's response to a leaked party report into anti-Semitism is the right one|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

The report was also criticised as being written to absolve the Corbyn leadership of the failure to deal with antisemitism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/antisemitism/status/1249285398783758342|title=Mammoth report by @UKLabour detailing anti- @jeremycorbyn conspiracy at Party’s HQ is “last ditch attempt to discredit #antisemitism allegations” and must be sent to EHRC

"",safe,Mika1h,"'''''AquaNox''''' is a series of [[submarine]]-based [[first-person shooter]]/[[Submarine simulator|simulation]] [[video game]]s set in the distant future. The collection includes ''AquaNox'', ''AquaNox 2: Revelation'' and ''AquaNox: The Angel's Tears''. The predecessor and the starter of the series is the [[MS-DOS]] title ''[[Archimedean Dynasty]]''.

==Concept==
In the middle of the 22nd century, raw materials on [[Earth]] became increasingly scarce and as the end of the resources loomed, people began to prospect for resources on the ocean floor. This resulted in the construction of mining stations beneath the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean|Indian ocean]]s. Many countries set up these deep-sea stations where workers and engineers extracted the oceans' treasures. Nevertheless, the output was far from enough to cover an ever-increasing demand. When the natural resources on Earth's surface were depleted, a time of destruction and wars began. In the fight over the planet's last remaining resources, alliances fell apart, countries became hostile and old conflicts flared up.

With increasing cruelty and senselessness, man destroyed the very basis of life on the surface of the earth. After a series of resource wars, nuclear weapons [[nuclear holocaust|completed the destruction]] that man had not yet finished with his industrial pollution. When the last glimmer of hope for humanity's survival was extinguished, people fled into the depths of the oceans.

The former extraction stations became the last refuge of those fortunate enough to be able to pay the price of entry into the underwater world. The poorest of the poor were left behind, condemned to die in a desolate world polluted by radioactivity. Life outside the oceans became impossible as the continents were flooded by rising sea levels and a harsh [[nuclear winter]] covered most of the oceans and the shrinking surface landmass of the planet with a layer of [[radioactive dust]], snow and ice many meters thick. A 40-meter thick layer of dead organic matter, the so-called POM layer, covered the oceans. Not a single ray of sunlight penetrated the dense particulate layer that plunged the world into a darkness like none other. Nevertheless, mankind rose one last time to a new life, the only life, in a dead new world. This world was humanity's creation, and was now called Aqua. The following events take place in the middle of the 27th century.

Today, in the year 2661, mankind lives in gigantic cities underwater. Aqua is divided into political power blocs, such as the Aquatoria of the capitalistic, democratically governed Atlantic Federation, the [[oligarchy]] of the Arabic Clans Union and the [[monarchy|monarchist]] Russo-Japanese [[Shogunate]]. In the South Pacific lies the Tornado Zone, stirred up by surface storms, where an anarchist pack of mercenaries, pirates, buccaneers and outlaws gathers, ever ready to sell their friends and their souls.

A single company has long ago monopolized many industries necessary for human survival underwater—EnTrOx, which stands for \"Energy-Transportation-[[Oxygen]]\". New technologies allow extremely fast underwater travel. However, many old technologies are lost or have become useless. For example, due to the high amounts of [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] in the atmosphere, satellite communication and [[Global Positioning System|global positioning]] are impossible, although some organizations are looking for ways to restore these abilities.

The player's task is to complete a series of story-related combat missions. During the course of the missions additional support and story elements are revealed by the secondary characters. The enemies range from hostile vessels to alien or artificial life-forms such as Bionts.

==Episodes==

The Aquanox series include the following games, listed by the release in a [[chronological order]]:

The player once again jumps into the role of Emerald \"Deadeye\" Flint. After the Bionts are defeated, Flint goes back to being a mercenary as a leader of a Biont-hunting task force. Things turn for the worse when his submarine, the ''[[Succubus]]'', is stolen on one of the stations. The game begins with one of Flint's dubious acquaintances giving him an old, barely working sub and several missions to get him started.

Throughout the game, Flint earns money by completing missions, allowing him to purchase better subs, weapons and equipment. The new equipment appears throughout the game, available for purchase, as the player progress in the storyline. Generally speaking, the player is allowed to buy a new boat and a new set of weaponry per chapter. While on stations, Flint can speak with various characters in order to get new missions and deepen the atmosphere of the game.

The former system of upgrading the vessel with a variety of defensive turrets has been simplified by fixing the player's view to the cockpit as well as permitting the usage of only two on-hull-installed cannons. As the result of this change, the controls of the submarine have been adapted to the first-person shooter's mouse-based layout, removing the need for the joystick, thus the game has compromised its tactical depth in order to increase the intensity of combat. This change has raised critique among the reviewers, stating that the developers' focus fell inadequately on the visual performance rather than the actual gameplay of its predecessor. {{quote|...But while ''Archimedean Dynasty'' was a complex, mission-based simulation with trading and privateering, ''AquaNox'' is an arcade-style action game that abandons or greatly simplifies those elements. Combat is fast paced and more similar in style to Quake's, or even a rail shooter's, than it is to the more tactical battles in other underwater sims.|{{cite news |last=Desslock |first= |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/aquanox/review.html |title=AquaNox Review |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2001-11-30}} }}

The game was one of the first applications to fully use the [[Transform, clipping, and lighting|T&L effects]] by supporting the ''[[NVIDIA]] Geforce 3 Ti'' graphics accelerator.{{quote|Considering the game engine has been used for months to market Nvidia's flagship GeForce 3 video card, it's no surprise that the graphics are outstanding. The game has been designed to take advantage of all the high-end capabilities of the GeForce and its latest generation of cards, and the environments look amazing as a result. Textures are colourful and extremely detailed, and there are numerous little graphical touches, such as chips that flake off underwater hills hit by your projectile weapons.|{{cite news |last=Desslock |first=  |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/aquanox/review.html?page=2 |title=AquaNox Review|publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2001-11-30}} }}

The game includes a vast amount of ''true'' information on oceans, such as origins of different species, their specifics and man's adaptation to submarine life. The game manual consists of two chapters explaining various terms and facts that have been mentioned throughout the course of the story.

===''AquaNox 2: Revelation''===
{{Infobox video game

The plot of the game centers on William Drake, the last remnant of the old aristocratic, industrialist family. After the bankruptcy of the family business and the death of the protagonist's grandmother, young William Drake sets \"sail\" for open seas on the last freighter of Drake Enterprises. The cargo ship soon gets taken over by a group of mercenaries while Drake rushes out to answer a distress call. While sparing his life, the group of seven invaders seize control of the boat, thus binding Williams' fate to their own. Drake sees no other option but to ally himself with his new crew, hoping for the best.

The game features a total of four unique, playable and upgradeable gunships. The player most likely switches boats depending on a given mission's parameters. While certain missions require speed and stealth, others virtually require a heavy arsenal and thick plating. The game features a large variety of projectile armament as well as a set of torpedoes and a collection of directed energy weaponry, including lasers and [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] launchers. The torpedo combat is similar to the missile engagements of most flight simulators and space shooters, where the pilot is expected to release flares and perform classic evasion manoeuvres.

Traveling is generally a simple matter of following the navigation points spread out through the game. The ship's controls can be switched from the [[First-person shooter|FPS]] mode to Simulation Mode via a predefined shortcut, where the latter steering scheme switches the horizontal scrolling of the mouse from turning the cockpit horizontally to rotating the hull around its axis. Reaching the surface is not possible due to the depth-range limitation, which binds the player to the underwater world yet gives certain disadvantages during combat.

In response to criticisms of poor interaction with other characters in AquaNox, a new dialogue system was added in the sequel. Between missions, the player is able to initiate conversations while on board the freighter as well as in the oceanic cities. The initiation of the conversations is mandatory. However, due to the absence of interaction during the dialogues, the outcome of the game is not open-ended. The dialogue and characters are the focus of many reviewers' ire, who criticize it as poorly-written and ultimately pointless.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gerstmann |first=Jeff |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/aquanox2revelation/review.html |title=Aquanox 2 Revelation Review|publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2003-09-29}}{{cite news |last=Deim |first=I. |url=http://www.gamershell.com/pc/aquanox_2_revelation/review.html |title=Aquanox 2 Revelation Review|publisher=Gamershell.com}}</ref>

Growth was rapid for Los Lunas in the 1990s and early 2000s, with the enrollment of [[Los Lunas High School]] reaching nearly 2,500 students around 2004. In fact, [[Valencia High School (Los Lunas, New Mexico)|Valencia High School]] opened in 2006 as a relief valve for that enrollment, but due in part to the recession of the late 2000s, the two schools had a similar enrollment by the end of the decade.

The town has been the site of two episodes of [[Breaking Bad]].

The '''mesosphere''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|s|oʊ|s|f|ɪər}}; from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''mesos'', \"middle\") is the third layer of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], directly above the [[stratosphere]] and directly below the [[thermosphere]].

This characteristic is used to define its limits: it begins at the top of the stratosphere (sometimes called the [[stratopause]]), and ends at the [[mesopause]], which is the coldest part of Earth's atmosphere with temperatures below {{convert|-143|C|F K}}. The exact upper and lower boundaries of the mesosphere vary with latitude and with season (higher in winter and at the tropics, lower in summer and at the poles), but the lower boundary is usually located at altitudes from {{convert|50|to|65|km|mi ft}} above the Earth's surface and the upper boundary (the mesopause) is usually around {{convert|85|to|100|km|mi ft}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/environment/atmosphere/middle-atmosphere|title=Middle atmosphere|website=www.antarctica.gov.au|access-date=17 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Venkat Ratnam|first=M.|last2=Patra|first2=A.

The stratosphere and the mesosphere are sometimes collectively referred to as the \"middle atmosphere\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://atmos.washington.edu/academic/midatmos.html|title=Middle Atmosphere Meteorology|website=atmos.washington.edu|access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref> which spans altitudes between approximately 12 and 80 kilometers above the Earth's surface. The [[mesopause]], at an altitude of {{convert|80|–|90|km|mi|abbr=on}}, separates the mesosphere from the [[thermosphere]]—the second-outermost layer of the Earth's atmosphere. This is the [[turbopause]], below which different chemical species are well-mixed due to turbulent [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]]. Above this level the atmosphere becomes non-uniform because the [[scale height]]s of different chemical species differ according to their [[molecular mass]]es.

The term '''near space''' is also sometimes used to refer to altitudes within the mesosphere. This term does not have a technical definition, but typically refers to the region of the atmosphere up to {{convert|100|km|mi ft}}, roughly between the [[Armstrong limit]] (above which humans require a [[pressure suit]] in order to survive) and the [[Kármán line]] (where [[astrodynamics]] must take over from [[aerodynamics]] in order to achieve flight); or, by another definition, to the range of altitudes above which commercial [[airliner]]s fly but below which [[satellite]]s orbit the Earth. Some sources distinguish between the terms \"near space\" and \"upper atmosphere\", so that only the layers closest to the Kármán line are described as \"near space\".

==Temperature==
Within the mesosphere, [[temperature]] decreases with increasing [[height]], due to decreasing absorption of solar radiation by the rarefied atmosphere and increasing cooling by CO<sub>2</sub> [[radiative emission]]. The top of the mesosphere, called the [[mesopause]], is the coldest part of Earth's atmosphere.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=mesosphere|file=M03855}}</ref> Temperatures in the upper mesosphere fall as low as {{convert|-101|C|K F|sigfig=3}},<ref>{{Citation|title=Mesosphere (Wayback Machine Archive)|url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/atmosphere/older/mesosphere.html|accessdate=14 November 2011|publisher=Atmosphere, Climate & Environment Information ProgGFKDamme (UK [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]])|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701030705/http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/atmosphere/older/mesosphere.html|archivedate=1 July 2010}}</ref> varying according to [[latitude]] and [[season]].

==Dynamic features==
The main most important features in this region are strong zonal (East-West) winds, [[atmospheric tide]]s, internal atmospheric gravity waves (commonly called \"[[gravity waves]]\"), and [[planetary wave]]s. Most of these tides and waves start in the [[troposphere]] and lower [[stratosphere]], and propagate to the mesosphere. In the mesosphere, gravity-wave amplitudes can become so large that the waves become unstable and dissipate. This dissipation deposits momentum into the mesosphere and largely drives global circulation. This helps the Earth.

[[Noctilucent cloud]]s are located in the mesosphere. The upper mesosphere is also the region of the [[ionosphere]] known as the ''D layer'', which is only present during the day when some [[ionization]] occurs with [[nitric oxide]] being ionized by [[Lyman series]]-alpha hydrogen radiation. The ionization is so weak that when night falls, and the source of ionization is removed, the free electron and ion form back into a neutral molecule. The mesosphere has been called the \"ignorosphere\" because it is poorly studied relative to the stratosphere (which can be accessed with high-altitude balloons) and the thermosphere (in which satellites can orbit).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-02-06-atmosphere_x.htm|title=Upper atmosphere may hold clues in Columbia mystery|date=6 February 2003}}</ref>

A {{convert|5|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} deep [[sodium layer]] is located between {{convert|80|-|105|km|abbr=on|mi ft}}. Made of unbound, non-ionized atoms of sodium, the sodium layer radiates weakly to contribute to the [[airglow]]. The sodium has an average concentration of 400,000 atoms per cubic centimetre. This band is regularly replenished by sodium [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimating]] from incoming meteors. Astronomers have begun utilizing this sodium band to create \"guide stars\" as part of the [[adaptive optics|adaptive optical correction process]] used to produce ultra-sharp ground-based observations.<ref>[http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/print/volume-52/issue-07/features/adaptive-optics-eso-s-very-large-telescope-sees-four-times-first-laser-light.html Martin Enderlein et al., ''ESO's Very Large Telescope sees four times first light'', Laser Focus World, July 2016, pp. 22-24]</ref> Other metal layers, e.g. iron and potassium, exist in the upper mesosphere/lower thermosphere region as well.

Beginning in October 2018,<ref>The \"dunes\" were first spotted by photographers in Finland and Sweden.</ref> a distinct type of [[aurora]] has been identified, originating in the mesosphere. Often referred to as 'dunes' due to their resemblance to sandy ripples on a beach, the green undulating lights extend toward the equator. They have been identified as originating about {{convert|96|km|abbr=on|mi ft}} above the surface. Since auroras are caused by ultra-high-speed solar particles interacting with atmospheric molecules, the green color of these dunes has tentatively been explained by the interaction of those solar particles with oxygen molecules. The dunes therefore occur where mesospheric oxygen is more concentrated.<ref>[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/new-type-aurora-ripples-across-sky-horizontal-green-dunes-180974083/?spMailingID=41658140&spUserID=NzQwNDUzNzY2MzMS1&spJobID=1682695015&spReportId=MTY4MjY5NTAxNQS2 Wu, Katherine J.

[[Noctilucent cloud]]s are located in the mesosphere. The upper mesosphere is also the region of the [[ionosphere]] known as the ''D layer'', which is only present during the day when some [[ionization]] occurs with [[nitric oxide]] being ionized by [[Lyman series]]-alpha hydrogen radiation. The ionization is so weak that when night falls, and the source of ionization is removed, the free electron and ion form back into a neutral molecule. The mesosphere has been called the \"ignorosphere\" because it is poorly studied relative to the stratosphere (which can be accessed with high-altitude balloons) and the thermosphere (in which satellites can orbit).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-02-06-atmosphere_x.htm|title=Upper atmosphere may hold clues in Columbia mystery|date=6 February 2003}}</ref>

A {{convert|5|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} deep [[sodium layer]] is located between {{convert|80|-|105|km|abbr=on|mi ft}}. Made of unbound, non-ionized atoms of sodium, the sodium layer radiates weakly to contribute to the [[airglow]]. The sodium has an average concentration of 400,000 atoms per cubic centimetre. This band is regularly replenished by sodium [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimating]] from incoming meteors. Astronomers have begun utilizing this sodium band to create \"guide stars\" as part of the [[adaptive optics|adaptive optical correction process]] used to produce ultra-sharp ground-based observations.<ref>[http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/print/volume-52/issue-07/features/adaptive-optics-eso-s-very-large-telescope-sees-four-times-first-laser-light.html Martin Enderlein et al., ''ESO's Very Large Telescope sees four times first light'', Laser Focus World, July 2016, pp. 22-24]</ref> Other metal layers, e.g. iron and potassium, exist in the upper mesosphere/lower thermosphere region as well.

Beginning in October 2018,<ref>The \"dunes\" were first spotted by photographers in Finland and Sweden.</ref> a distinct type of [[aurora]] has been identified, originating in the mesosphere. Often referred to as 'dunes' due to their resemblance to sandy ripples on a beach, the green undulating lights extend toward the equator. They have been identified as originating about {{convert|96|km|abbr=on|mi ft}} above the surface. Since auroras are caused by ultra-high-speed solar particles interacting with atmospheric molecules, the green color of these dunes has tentatively been explained by the interaction of those solar particles with oxygen molecules. The dunes therefore occur where mesospheric oxygen is more concentrated.<ref>[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/new-type-aurora-ripples-across-sky-horizontal-green-dunes-180974083/?spMailingID=41658140&spUserID=NzQwNDUzNzY2MzMS1&spJobID=1682695015&spReportId=MTY4MjY5NTAxNQS2 Wu, Katherine J.

'''Rottweil''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁɔtvaɪl|lang|Rottweil.ogg}}) is a town in southwest [[Germany]] in the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]]. Rottweil was a [[Free Imperial City]] for nearly 600 years.

Located between the [[Black Forest]] and the [[Swabian Jura|Swabian Alps]], Rottweil has about 25,000 inhabitants. The old town is famous for its [[medieval]] center and for its traditional [[carnival]] (called \"[[Fastnacht|Fasnet]]\" in the local [[Swabian German|Swabian]] dialect). It is the oldest town in Baden-Württemberg,<ref>Website of Dominikaner Museum Rottweil (retrieved May 22, 2014), on permanent display is a wooden table from August 4, AD 186 naming arae flaviae as [[municipium]] thus making Rottweil the oldest town in Baden-Württemberg [http://www.dominikanermuseum.de/cms/?q=node/3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521235015/http://www.dominikanermuseum.de/cms/?q=node%2F3 |date=2014-05-21 }}</ref> and its appearance has changed very little since the 16th century.

Rottweil was founded by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in AD 73 as [[Flavian dynasty|Arae Flaviae]] and became a ''[[municipium]]'', but there are traces of human settlement going back to 2000 BC. [[Thermae|Roman baths]] and an [[Orpheus mosaic]] of c. AD 180 date from the time of Roman settlement. The present town became a ducal and a royal court before 771 and in 1268 it became a [[Free Imperial City]].

In 1463 Rottweil joined the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]] under the pretence of a temporary alliance. In 1476 the Rottweilers fought on the Swiss side against [[Charles the Bold]] in the [[Battle of Morat]]. In 1512, Pope Julius II gave the city a valuable [[Juliusbanner|\"Julius banner\"]] for its services in the 1508-1510 \"Great Pavier Campaign\" to expel the French.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hecht |first1=Winfried |title=The Julius Banner of the Village of Rottweil |url=https://www.e-periodica.ch/digbib/view?pid=gfr-001:1973:126::424#149 |website=ETHZürich |accessdate=2019-01-25}}</ref> In 1519, the Rottweilers left the old Swiss alliance. They joined a new one in which their membership was extended indefinitely – the so-called \"Eternal Covenant\".

Rottweil thus became a centre of the Swiss Confederation. The relations between the Swiss Confederation and Rottweil cooled rapidly during the Reformation. When Rottweil was troubled by wars, however, it still asked the Confederates for help.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hecht |first1=Winfried |title=Rottweil |url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D7104.php |website=Historical Dictionary of Switzerland |accessdate=2019-01-25}}</ref>

In the [[Rottweil Witch Hunts]] from 1546 to 1661, 266 so-called witches, wizards and magicians were executed in the imperial city of Rottweil. On April 15, 2015, they were given a posthumous pardon. An official apology was given by the City Council about 400 years after their violent death.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Zeck |first1=Mario |title=\"Im Rauch gehen Himmel geschüggt\", Hexenverfolgung in der Reichsstadt Rottweil, |date=2000 |publisher=Stuttgart |page=43}}</ref>

Rottweil lost both its status as free city and its alliance with the Swiss Confederacy with the conquest of the region by [[Napoleon]] in 1803.

Rottweil was founded by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in AD 73 as [[Flavian dynasty|Arae Flaviae]] and became a ''[[municipium]]'', but there are traces of human settlement going back to 2000 BC. [[Thermae|Roman baths]] and an [[Orpheus mosaic]] of c. AD 180 date from the time of Roman settlement. The present town became a ducal and a royal court before 771 and in 1268 it became a [[Free Imperial City]].

In 1463 Rottweil joined the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]] under the pretence of a temporary alliance. In 1476 the Rottweilers fought on the Swiss side against [[Charles the Bold]] in the [[Battle of Morat]]. In 1512, Pope Julius II gave the city a valuable [[Juliusbanner|\"Julius banner\"]] for its services in the 1508-1510 \"Great Pavier Campaign\" to expel the French.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hecht |first1=Winfried |title=The Julius Banner of the Village of Rottweil |url=https://www.e-periodica.ch/digbib/view?pid=gfr-001:1973:126::424#149 |website=ETHZürich |accessdate=2019-01-25}}</ref> In 1519, the Rottweilers left the old Swiss alliance. They joined a new one in which their membership was extended indefinitely – the so-called \"Eternal Covenant\".

Rottweil thus became a centre of the Swiss Confederation. The relations between the Swiss Confederation and Rottweil cooled rapidly during the Reformation. When Rottweil was troubled by wars, however, it still asked the Confederates for help.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hecht |first1=Winfried |title=Rottweil |url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D7104.php |website=Historical Dictionary of Switzerland |accessdate=2019-01-25}}</ref>

In the [[Rottweil Witch Hunts]] from 1546 to 1661, 266 so-called witches, wizards and magicians were executed in the imperial city of Rottweil. On April 15, 2015, they were given a posthumous pardon. An official apology was given by the City Council about 400 years after their violent death.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Zeck |first1=Mario |title=\"Im Rauch gehen Himmel geschüggt\", Hexenverfolgung in der Reichsstadt Rottweil, |date=2000 |publisher=Stuttgart |page=43}}</ref>

Rottweil lost both its status as free city and its alliance with the Swiss Confederacy with the conquest of the region by [[Napoleon]] in 1803.
