Many actions aim to build social and political support to limit, and subsequently reduce, the concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHGs) in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], with the goal of [[Climate change mitigation|mitigating climate change]]. Other actions seek to address the ethical and moral aspects of [[climate justice]], especially with regard to the anticipated unequal impacts of [[climate change adaptation]].\n\n== Political action ==\n{{Main|Politics of global warming}}\nPolitical action can change laws and regulations that relate to [[climate change]].\n\n[[Carbon price|Carbon pricing]] methods, such as a [[carbon tax]] or an [[emissions trading]] system, are favored by many economists as the most efficient and effective means to reduce GHG emissions, and are increasingly being deployed around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/25160|title=State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 2016|last=The World Bank|date=October 2016|website=The World Bank|access-date=4 Feb 2017}}</ref> In the U.S., groups such as the bipartisan legislative Climate Solutions Caucus<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/274061-creating-a-bipartisan-climate-to-discuss-climate|title=Creating a bipartisan climate to discuss climate change in Congress|last=Picard|first=Joe|date=2016-03-24|newspaper=TheHill|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref> and the [[Citizens' Climate Lobby]] work to build support for carbon pricing.

Political action from the community, however, is often challenged by interests within the [[fossil-fuel industry]],<ref>Hamilton, Clive (2007), \"[[Scorcher: The Dirty Politics of Climate Change]]\"</ref><ref>[[Paul R.

Political action campaigns require building a base of support at local level.\n\nThere are many facts that point to the existence of [[climate change]]. The plentiful hurricanes, droughts, and fires are all in part due to the ever changing atmosphere caused by climate change. One of the ways in which the human race can get in front of this change is through political action.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asyousow.org/our-work/energy/climate-change|title=Climate Change|website=As You Sow|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-30}}</ref> Legislative action is one strategy that politicians are using to combat carbon emissions. The way these laws will come about is via political action. [[Greenhouse gas|Carbon emissions]] are a significant causing factor for climate change and by putting federal regulations such as a carbon tax there will overall be a decrease in carbon emissions. This allows the private sector to decide how to do so cost effectively which in turn benefits the environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.c2es.org/content/federal-action-on-climate/|title=Federal Action on Climate|date=2017-10-21|website=Center for Climate and Energy Solutions|access-date=2019-04-01}}</ref> The private sector is one deciding factor in how governments enact their policies.

[[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) from diverse fields of work have united on this issue. A [[coalition]] of 50 NGOs called [[Stop Climate Chaos]] launched in Britain in 2005 to highlight the issue of climate change.\n\nThe [[Campaign against Climate Change]] was created to focus purely on the issue of climate change and to pressure governments into action by building a protest movement of sufficient magnitude to effect political change.\n\n[[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] is an event typically held on the last Friday of every month in various cities around the world wherein [[bicyclist]]s and, less frequently, [[unicycle|unicyclists]], [[skateboard]]ers, [[inline skate]]rs, [[rollerskates|roller skaters]] and other self-propelled commuters take to the streets ''[[en masse]].''

The language of the agreement was negotiated by representatives of 195 countries at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC]] (COP21) in [[Paris]] and adopted by consensus on 12 December 2015.\n\nThe head of the Paris Conference, France's foreign minister [[Laurent Fabius]], called the plan \"ambitious and balanced\" and an \"historic turning point\" in the goal of reducing global warming. [[Paris Agreement#Concerns|Critics note]] that the agreement is not sufficient to achieve the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C warming target, and the lack of any binding enforcement mechanism. Subsequent Conference of the Parties meetings are expected to address shortcomings in the Paris Agreement.\n\nAmid fierce opposition from scientists and other leaders around the world, U.S. President Donald Trump has [[Political positions of Donald Trump#Opposition to international cooperation on climate change|pledged to pull out of the Paris Agreement]].\n\n[[Paris Agreement|The Paris Agreement]], which was brought to discussion on November 12, 2016, was made with a goal in mind to unite all countries against the threat of climate change. This argument stipulates that all countries involved contribute financially and regularly report on emissions and the status of national progress. At this point, over half the countries in Convention who were responsible for over half of greenhouse emissions, had ratified.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement|title=The Paris Agreement}}</ref>\n\n=== The European Union  ===\n[[File:Secretary Kerry and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon Address Reporters.jpg|thumb|Pictured above are US Secretary Kerry and the UN Secretary-General at the COP21 meeting of the UNFCCC in Paris.]]\nUnder the [[Kyoto Protocol]], countries with targets could elect to reach these targets in co-operation with other countries. The [[European Union]] has decided to work as a unit to meet its emissions targets. The European climate change program attempts to do this by utilising an emissions trading scheme known as the [[European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme]]. The principle of this scheme is quite simple: to make their legally binding commitments under Kyoto, countries can either make these savings within their own country, or they can buy these emissions reductions from other countries. These other countries would still need to meet their Kyoto targets, but the use of a [[free market]] system ensures the reductions are made for the least possible costs. Most reductions are made where these reductions are cheapest, and the excess reductions can be sold on to other countries where such cuts would be less economically viable. The EU ETS is arguably the global template for emissions trading schemes that are being implemented globally (China, South Korea, Tokyo and others).<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1142/S2345748114500031|title = Framing It Right: China\u2013EU Relations and Patterns of Interaction on Climate Change|journal = Chinese Journal of Urban and Environmental Studies|volume = 02|pages = 1450003|year = 2014|last1 = Gippner|first1 = Olivia}}</ref>\n\nThe commitment of the [[European Union]] to cut back on its excessive green house gas emissions came from the implementation of the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. Since its application, the Doha amendments, which were made to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, have come to regulate this protocol and update the Union's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This second round of the Kyoto Protocol created a legally binding agreement for participating EU countries until 2020. Under this plan, by 2030, there are hopes of the EU cutting their emissions by 40%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/eu-conclude-ratification-second-kyoto-protocol-commitment-period-end-year_en|title=EU to conclude ratification for second Kyoto Protocol commitment period by end of this year}}</ref>\n\n\nStates that become more involving or are and concerned about ability are more than likely to have more consistency; compared to the least become more refrained with agreements that comply decrease of legalization. \u201cEmpirical analyses of ratification of the FCCC and the Kyoto Protocol yield strong support for these propositions\u201d .<ref>{{cite journal |last1=von Stein |first1=Jana |title=The International Law and Politics of Climate Change |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |date=April 2008 |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=243\u2013268 |doi=10.1177/0022002707313692 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022002707313692 |issn=0022-0027}}</ref>\n\n=== Contraction and Convergence ===\nThe concept of Cap, [[Contraction and Convergence]] was proposed as a replacement to the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto agreement]]. The idea here is that the limits to carbon emissions need to be capped at 350-450 parts per million, currently{{When|date=October 2019}} considered to produce a raise in world temperatures above pre-industrial levels of between 1 and 2 degrees Celsius. It is currently{{When|date=October 2019}} believed that further increases would bring about major positive feedbacks (the burning of forests and the loss of carbon from soils and oceans) which currently limit greenhouse gas emissions, and would lead to a run-away global warming similar to the [[Eocene]] period, during which there was no ice at the poles.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nTo sustain this figure, it has been proposed that on equity grounds, all people should be allocated an equal carbon footprint (currently about 2 tonnes per person, which by 2050 could fall to 1.5 tonnes per person through population increase). World per capita carbon emissions, currently in excess of 4 tonnes per person needs to contract to those levels, if these targets are to be met.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carbonsense.com/|title=CarbonSense|website=CarbonSense}}</ref> As a result, in the name of global and inter-generational equity, policies needing to be instituted need to converge, over a fixed period towards this figure for every country. A trading regime, whereby which countries in excess of these figures (from example the [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States|US at 20 tonnes per capita]]), purchase [[carbon credit]]s from a country using less than its allocation (e.g. [[Kenya]] at 1.3 tonnes per capita), is considered by many as the best way of solving this problem.\n\nFor example, the Contract and Converge strategy was adopted by India, [[PRC|China]] and many African countries as the basis for future negotiations. The UK [[Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution]] said in 2000 \"the [[UK]] should be prepared to accept the contraction and convergence principle is the basis for international agreement on greenhouse gas emissions\".<ref>Meyer, Aubrey (2000), \"Contraction and Convergence:The Global Solution to Climate Change\" Schumacher Briefings 5, published by Green Books on behalf of the [[E. F. Schumacher|Schumacher]] Society</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] met in Paris to negotiate a new agreement. This meeting was the [[COP21|21st Conference of Parties]] (COP21). In this agreement, the goal was to keep temperatures under 1.5 degrees Celsius. While this goal was seen as progress in the fight against climate change, some more liable countries saw this as unattainable. They also thought some important steps were not taken during this meeting; however, everyone seemed optimistic for the future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-ir.info/2016/04/11/climate-change-and-international-relations/|title=Climate Change and International Relations|date=April 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Sub-national level action ==\nSome states, regions, and cities in the world are taking the lead on developing emissions reduction methods in the absence of national policy, and may provide models for future national efforts.

The project touches on five main topics: i) home energy; ii) food; iii) travel; iv) consumption and waste; and v) talking with family and friends. The project understands that individuals often fail to adopt low-carbon lifestyles not because of practical barriers to change (e.g.: there is no renewable energy available), but because of aspects related to their values, emotions, and identity. The project offers a supportive group experience that helps people reduce their personal carbon dioxide emissions by 1 tonne {{CO2}} on average and aim at halving it in the long term. They deal with the difficulties of change by connecting to values, emotions and identity. The groups are based on a [[psychosocial]] understanding of how people change. Groups of 6-8 members meet six or twelve times with trained facilitators in homes, community centres, workplaces or other venues. The meetings create a non-judgmental atmosphere where people are encouraged to make serious lifestyle changes.\n\nCarbon Conversations was cited in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper as one of the 20 best ideas to tackle climate change.<ref>Katz, Ian (2009).

The biggest wellspring of [[greenhouse gas emissions]] are from human activities. Around 66% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions are connected to consuming fossil fuels for energy to utilize for warming, power, transport and industry.

Political action campaigns require building a base of support at local level.\n\nThere are many facts that point to the existence of [[climate change]]. The plentiful hurricanes, droughts, and fires are all in part due to the ever changing atmosphere caused by climate change. One of the ways in which the human race can get in front of this change is through political action.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asyousow.org/our-work/energy/climate-change|title=Climate Change|website=As You Sow|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-30}}</ref> Legislative action is one strategy that politicians are using to combat carbon emissions. The way these laws will come about is via political action. [[Greenhouse gas|Carbon emissions]] are a significant causing factor for climate change and by putting federal regulations such as a carbon tax there will overall be a decrease in carbon emissions. This allows the private sector to decide how to do so cost effectively which in turn benefits the environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.c2es.org/content/federal-action-on-climate/|title=Federal Action on Climate|date=2017-10-21|website=Center for Climate and Energy Solutions|access-date=2019-04-01}}</ref> The private sector is one deciding factor in how governments enact their policies.

The language of the agreement was negotiated by representatives of 195 countries at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC]] (COP21) in [[Paris]] and adopted by consensus on 12 December 2015.\n\nThe head of the Paris Conference, France's foreign minister [[Laurent Fabius]], called the plan \"ambitious and balanced\" and an \"historic turning point\" in the goal of reducing global warming. [[Paris Agreement#Concerns|Critics note]] that the agreement is not sufficient to achieve the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C warming target, and the lack of any binding enforcement mechanism. Subsequent Conference of the Parties meetings are expected to address shortcomings in the Paris Agreement.\n\nAmid fierce opposition from scientists and other leaders around the world, U.S. President Donald Trump has [[Political positions of Donald Trump#Opposition to international cooperation on climate change|pledged to pull out of the Paris Agreement]].\n\n[[Paris Agreement|The Paris Agreement]], which was brought to discussion on November 12, 2016, was made with a goal in mind to unite all countries against the threat of climate change. This argument stipulates that all countries involved contribute financially and regularly report on emissions and the status of national progress. At this point, over half the countries in Convention who were responsible for over half of greenhouse emissions, had ratified.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement|title=The Paris Agreement}}</ref>\n\n=== The European Union  ===\n[[File:Secretary Kerry and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon Address Reporters.jpg|thumb|Pictured above are US Secretary Kerry and the UN Secretary-General at the COP21 meeting of the UNFCCC in Paris.]]\nUnder the [[Kyoto Protocol]], countries with targets could elect to reach these targets in co-operation with other countries. The [[European Union]] has decided to work as a unit to meet its emissions targets. The European climate change program attempts to do this by utilising an emissions trading scheme known as the [[European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme]]. The principle of this scheme is quite simple: to make their legally binding commitments under Kyoto, countries can either make these savings within their own country, or they can buy these emissions reductions from other countries. These other countries would still need to meet their Kyoto targets, but the use of a [[free market]] system ensures the reductions are made for the least possible costs. Most reductions are made where these reductions are cheapest, and the excess reductions can be sold on to other countries where such cuts would be less economically viable. The EU ETS is arguably the global template for emissions trading schemes that are being implemented globally (China, South Korea, Tokyo and others).<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1142/S2345748114500031|title = Framing It Right: China\u2013EU Relations and Patterns of Interaction on Climate Change|journal = Chinese Journal of Urban and Environmental Studies|volume = 02|pages = 1450003|year = 2014|last1 = Gippner|first1 = Olivia}}</ref>\n\nThe commitment of the [[European Union]] to cut back on its excessive green house gas emissions came from the implementation of the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. Since its application, the Doha amendments, which were made to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, have come to regulate this protocol and update the Union's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This second round of the Kyoto Protocol created a legally binding agreement for participating EU countries until 2020. Under this plan, by 2030, there are hopes of the EU cutting their emissions by 40%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/eu-conclude-ratification-second-kyoto-protocol-commitment-period-end-year_en|title=EU to conclude ratification for second Kyoto Protocol commitment period by end of this year}}</ref>\n\n=== Contraction and Convergence ===\nThe concept of Cap, [[Contraction and Convergence]] was proposed as a replacement to the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto agreement]]. The idea here is that the limits to carbon emissions need to be capped at 350-450 parts per million, currently{{When|date=October 2019}} considered to produce a raise in world temperatures above pre-industrial levels of between 1 and 2 degrees Celsius. It is currently{{When|date=October 2019}} believed that further increases would bring about major positive feedbacks (the burning of forests and the loss of carbon from soils and oceans) which currently limit greenhouse gas emissions, and would lead to a run-away global warming similar to the [[Eocene]] period, during which there was no ice at the poles.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nTo sustain this figure, it has been proposed that on equity grounds, all people should be allocated an equal carbon footprint (currently about 2 tonnes per person, which by 2050 could fall to 1.5 tonnes per person through population increase). World per capita carbon emissions, currently in excess of 4 tonnes per person needs to contract to those levels, if these targets are to be met.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carbonsense.com/|title=CarbonSense|website=CarbonSense}}</ref> As a result, in the name of global and inter-generational equity, policies needing to be instituted need to converge, over a fixed period towards this figure for every country. A trading regime, whereby which countries in excess of these figures (from example the [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States|US at 20 tonnes per capita]]), purchase [[carbon credit]]s from a country using less than its allocation (e.g. [[Kenya]] at 1.3 tonnes per capita), is considered by many as the best way of solving this problem.\n\nFor example, the Contract and Converge strategy was adopted by India, [[PRC|China]] and many African countries as the basis for future negotiations. The UK [[Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution]] said in 2000 \"the [[UK]] should be prepared to accept the contraction and convergence principle is the basis for international agreement on greenhouse gas emissions\".<ref>Meyer, Aubrey (2000), \"Contraction and Convergence:The Global Solution to Climate Change\" Schumacher Briefings 5, published by Green Books on behalf of the [[E. F. Schumacher|Schumacher]] Society</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] met in Paris to negotiate a new agreement. This meeting was the [[COP21|21st Conference of Parties]] (COP21). In this agreement, the goal was to keep temperatures under 1.5 degrees Celsius. While this goal was seen as progress in the fight against climate change, some more liable countries saw this as unattainable.

Their efforts are achieving real measurable emissions reductions and by pursuing policies and programs that have climate benefits, they have promoted state economic development, improved air quality and trimmed their vulnerability to energy price spikes. In the long run, addressing climate change will require comprehensive national policy and international agreements. However, in the US, due to absence of federal policy, states and regions are taking the lead on developing policies that may provide models for future national efforts.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite paper |author= Engel, Kirsten and Barak Orbach |title= Micro-Motives for State and Local Climate Change Initiatives |version= |publisher= [[Harvard Law & Policy Review]], Vol. 2, pp. 119-137 |year= 2008 |ssrn= 1014749 |format= }}</ref>\n\n=== Climate budget by the State of Odisha===\nWhile presenting the fiscal year 2020-2021 state budget for the Indian state of [[Odisha]], Finance Minister of the state Niranjan Pujari introduced the Climate Budget.<ref>{{cite news |title=Odisha first state to have \u2018climate, nutrition budgets\u2019 - OrissaPOST |url=https://www.orissapost.com/odisha-first-state-to-have-climate-nutrition-budgets/ |work=Odisha News, Odisha Latest news, Odisha Daily - OrissaPOST |date=18 February 2020}}</ref> Climate budget aims to keep track of the expenses made by the government for climate change or to support mitigation and adaption actions to address climate change.

The project touches on five main topics: i) home energy; ii) food; iii) travel; iv) consumption and waste; and v) talking with family and friends. The project understands that individuals often fail to adopt low-carbon lifestyles not because of practical barriers to change (e.g.: there is no renewable energy available), but because of aspects related to their values, emotions, and identity. The project offers a supportive group experience that helps people reduce their personal carbon dioxide emissions by 1 tonne {{CO2}} on average and aim at halving it in the long term. They deal with the difficulties of change by connecting to values, emotions and identity. The groups are based on a [[psychosocial]] understanding of how people change. Groups of 6-8 members meet six or twelve times with trained facilitators in homes, community centres, workplaces or other venues. The meetings create a non-judgmental atmosphere where people are encouraged to make serious lifestyle changes.\n\nCarbon Conversations was cited in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper as one of the 20 best ideas to tackle climate change.<ref>Katz, Ian (2009).

The biggest wellspring of [[greenhouse gas emissions]] are from human activities. Around 66% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions are connected to consuming fossil fuels for energy to utilize for warming, power, transport and industry. In Europe, as well, energy processes are the biggest producer of\ngreenhouse gases, 78% of total EU emissions in 2015.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Energy and climate change|url=https://www.eea.europa.eu/signals/signals-2017/articles/energy-and-climate-change|language=en}}</ref>\n[[File:Food-healthy-vegetables-potatoes (23958160949).jpg|thumb|Vegetables on sale]]\n\n=== Consumers and diet ===\nThe 2019 [[World Scientists' Warning to Humanity#2019 warning on the climate change|World Scientists\u2019 Warning of a Climate Emergency]], endorsed by over 11,000 scientists from more than 150 countries, stated that \"eating mostly plant-based foods while reducing the global consumption of animal products, especially ruminant livestock, can improve human health and significantly lower GHG emissions.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Ripple |first1=William J.|last2=Wolf|first2=Christopher |last3= Newsome |first3=Thomas M |last4=Barnard |first4= Phoebe  |last5= Moomaw |first5=William R |date=November 5, 2019 |title=World Scientists\u2019 Warning of a Climate Emergency |url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biz088/5610806 |journal=[[BioScience]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1093/biosci/biz088}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[10:10]]\n* [[1Sky]]\n* [[350.org]] and [[Bill McKibben]]\n* [[Action for Climate Empowerment]] (ACE)\n* [[Alliance for Climate Protection]]\n* [[Anthropization]]\n* [[Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change]]\n* [[Business action on climate change]]\n* [[Carbon Diet]]\n* [[Citizens' Climate Lobby]]\n* [[Climate Action Plan]]\n* [[Climate change mitigation scenarios]]\n* [[COP16]]\n* [[Global Climate Network]]\n* [[Global Day of Action]]\n* [[Greenpeace]], [[Kumi Naidoo]] and [[Phil Radford]]\n* [[Hypermobility (travel)]]\n* [[Large Cities Climate Leadership Group]]\n* [[Low Carbon Diet]]\n* [[Low-carbon economy]]\n* [[No Impact Man]] ([[Colin Beavan]])\n* [[One Watt Initiative]]\n* [[Politics of global warming]]\n* [[Power Shift]]\n* [[:Category:Religious action on climate change|Religious action on climate change]]\n* [[School strike for climate]]\n** [[Greta Thunberg]]\n* [[Thorium-based nuclear power]]\n* [[Youth Climate Movement]]\n** [[Indian Youth Climate Network]]\n** [[UK Youth Climate Coalition]]\n** [[Australian Youth Climate Coalition]]\n* [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC)\n* ''[[The Cool War]]''\n* ''[[The Great Warming]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [[appropedia:Air travel, climate change, and green consumerism|Air travel, climate change, and green consumerism]] at ''Appropedia''\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100718132111/http://igrec.in/is_coersion_necessary_for_mitigating_climate_change.html Is coercion necessary for mitigating climate change?]\n* Anderson, K.
