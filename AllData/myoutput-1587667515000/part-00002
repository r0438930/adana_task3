Situated in [[Southern Ontario]], it is a suburban city in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] (GTA) and the seat of [[Regional Municipality of Peel|Peel Region]]. The city has a population of 593,638 as of the [[Canada 2016 Census]]. Brampton is Canada's [[List of the 100 largest municipalities in Canada by population|ninth-most populous municipality]], the [[List of North American cities by population|seventy-seventh largest city]] in [[North America]] and the third most populous city in the [[Greater Golden Horseshoe]] Region, behind [[Toronto]] and [[Mississauga, Ontario|Mississauga]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBrampton was incorporated as a village in 1853, with a population of 50 residents, taking its name from the market town of [[Brampton, Carlisle|Brampton]], in [[Cumbria]], England. In 1873, with 2,000 residents, Brampton was incorporated as a town. The city was once known as \"The Flower Town of Canada\", a title based on its large [[greenhouse]] industry. Today, Brampton's major economic sectors include advanced manufacturing, [[retail]] administration, [[logistics]], [[information and communication technologies|information, and communication technologies]], food and beverage, [[life sciences]], and business services. Mass [[Immigration to Canada|immigration]] notably from the [[Indian subcontinent]] has greatly increased Brampton's population \u2013 from 10,000 in the 1950s to over 600,000 today.\n\n==History==\n[[File:John Haggert.gif|thumb|right|upright|[[John Haggert]], Brampton's first mayor]]\n\n{{main|History of Brampton}}\n{{see also|List of mayors of Brampton|Brampton Fall Fair|Brampton Library}}\n\nPrior to the 1800s, all real business in [[Chinguacousy Township, Ontario|Chinguacousy Township]] took place at Martin Salisbury's tavern. One mile distant at the corner of Main and Queen streets, now the recognised centre of Brampton, William Buffy's tavern was the only significant building.  At the time, the area was referred to as \"Buffy's Corners\". By 1834, John Elliott laid out the area in lots for sale, calling it \"Brampton\", which was soon adopted by others.<ref name=100years>\"Brampton's Beginning\" in ''Bramptons's 100th Anniversary as an Incorporated Town: 1873\u20131973'', Brampton: The Corporation of the Town of Brampton and the Brampton Centennial Committee, 1973, originally published in Ross Cumming, ed., ''Historical Atlas of Peel County'', n.p.: Walker and Miles, 1877.</ref>\n\nIn 1853, a small agricultural fair was set up by the newly initiated County Agricultural Society of the County of Peel, and was held at the corner of Main and Queen streets. Grains, produce, roots, and dairy products were up for sale. Horses and cattle, along with other lesser livestock, were also sold at market. This agricultural fair eventually became the modern [[Brampton Fall Fair]].\n\nIn that same year Brampton was incorporated as a village.<ref name=100years /> In 1866, the town became the county seat and the location of the [[Peel County Courthouse]] which was built in 1865-66; a three-storey County gaol was added at the rear in 1867.\n\nEdward Dale, an immigrant from [[Dorking]], England, established a flower nursery in Brampton<ref name=\"nursery\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.brampton.ca/en/Arts-Culture-Tourism/heritage/Pages/Brampton's-History.aspx\n  | title = Discover Brampton's History\n  | publisher = City of Brampton\n  | accessdate = 2010-04-08\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100221032242/http://www.brampton.ca/en/Arts-Culture-Tourism/heritage/Pages/Brampton%27s-History.aspx\n  | archivedate = 2010-02-21\n  }}</ref> shortly after his arrival in 1863.<ref name=\"bost\" /> Dale's Nursery became the town's largest<ref name=\"nursery\" /> and most prominent employer, developed a flower grading system,<ref name=\"bost\" /> and established a global export market for its products.<ref name=\"nursery\" /> The company [[chimney]] was a town landmark,<ref name=\"bost\" /> until [[Brampton City Council|Brampton Town Council]] allowed it to be torn down in 1977.<ref name=\"bost\" /> At its height, the company had 140 greenhouses,<ref name=\"acresof\">{{cite book\n |url          = http://acresofglass.com/\n |title        = Acres of Glass: The Story of the Dale Estate and How Brampton Became \"The Flower Town of Canada\"\n |last         = O'Hara\n |first        = Dale\n |publisher    = Eastendbooks\n |date         = September 2007\n |isbn         = 978-1-896973-39-5\n |accessdate   = 2010-04-08\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619202006/http://www.acresofglass.com/\n |archive-date = 2009-06-19\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref> and was the largest [[Floriculture|cut flower]] business in North America,<ref name=\"floriculture\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.catchthespiritbrampton.com/flowertown.php\n  | title = Brampton's FlowerTown Heritage\n  | accessdate = 2010-04-08\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708123544/http://www.catchthespiritbrampton.com/flowertown.php\n  | archivedate = 2011-07-08\n  }}</ref> producing 20 million blooms and introducing numerous rose and orchid varietals and species to the market.<ref name=\"floriculture\" /> It also spurred the development of other nurseries in the town.

In 1907, the library received a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, set up by United States steel [[magnate]] and [[philanthropist]] [[Andrew Carnegie]], to build a new, expanded library; it serves several purposes, featuring the [[Brampton Library]]. The [[Carnegie libraries]] were built on the basis of communities coming up with matching funds and guaranteeing maintenance.\n\nIn 1902, Sir [[William James Gage|William J. Gage]] (owner of Gage Publishing, a publishing house specializing in school text books) purchased a 3.25 acres (1.3 hectares) part of the gardens and lawns of the Alder Lea estate (now called Alderlea) that had been built on Main Street by Kenneth Chisolm in 1867 to 1870.

After several meetings in Clairville Hall, they decided to found the County of Peel Farmers Mutual Fire Insurance Company. In 1955, when the company moved to its third and current location, 103 Queen Street West, it took the new name of Peel Mutual Insurance Company. It reigns as the longest-running company in modern Brampton. Harmsworth Decorating Centre was established in 1890, as Harmsworth and Son, operated out of the family's house on Queen Street West. The current location was purchased on September 1, 1904, after a fire destroyed their original store. Purchased for $1,400, the 24 Main Street South location is the longest-operating retail business in what is now Brampton.\n\nIn 1974, the two townships of Chinguacousy and Toronto Gore were incorporated into Brampton. The small pine added to the centre of the shield on the Brampton city flag represents Chinguacousy, honouring the [[Chippewa]] chief ''Shinguacose,'' \"The Small Pine.\" After this merger, outlying communities such as [[Bramalea, Ontario|Bramalea]], [[Heart Lake (Ontario)|Heart Lake]] and [[Professor's Lake]], [[Snelgrove, Ontario|Snelgrove]], [[Tullamore, Ontario|Tullamore]], and [[Mayfield, Ontario|Mayfield]], were developed.\n\nIn 1963, the town established ''The Flower Festival of Brampton'', based on the ''[[Portland Rose Festival|Rose Festival]]'' of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] in the United States.

Located in the former [[Chinguacousy Township, Ontario|Chinguacousy Township]], it was Canada's first satellite community developed by one of the country's largest real estate developers, ''Bramalea Limited.'' The name \"Bramalea\" was created by the farmer William Sheard, who combined \"BRAM\" from Brampton, \"MAL\" from Malton (then a neighbouring town which is now part of the city of [[Mississauga]]), and \"LEA\", an [[Old English]] word meaning meadow or grassland.  He sold the land to Brampton Leasing (the former name of the developer) and built one of Bramalea's first houses on Dixie Road.\n\nThe community was developed according to its detailed [[Strategic planning|master plan]], which included provisions for a parkland trail system and a \"downtown\" to include essential services and a [[shopping centre]]. The downtown's centrepiece was the Civic Centre, built in 1972 to include the city hall and library. Directly across Team Canada Drive, a shopping centre named [[Bramalea City Centre]] was built. These developments were connected by a long tunnel, planned to provide protection from winter weather. But, the tunnel has long since been closed due to safety issues. Urbanists have also found that pedestrians at street level make for much livelier and safer streets. Other features included a police station, fire hall, bus terminal, and a collection of seniors' retirement homes.\n\nEach phase of the new city was marked with progressing first letters of [[street name]]s. Development started with the \"A\" section, with street names such as Argyle, Avondale, and Aloma. Developers then created a \"B\" section, \"C\" section, and so forth. Children on the boundaries of these divisions would regularly compete in street hockey games, pitting, for example, the \"D\" section versus the \"E\" section.\n\nThe community was initially developed with a large number of recreational facilities, including tennis courts, playgrounds, hockey/lacrosse rinks and swimming pools. An extensive parkland trail and sidewalk system connects the entire community.\n\n===Region of Peel===\n[[File:pelbrm.PNG|thumb|right|Brampton in the Region of Peel]]\n[[File:Brampton City Hall.jpg|thumb|Brampton's City Hall]]\n\nIn 1974, the Ontario provincial government decided to update [[Peel County, Ontario|Peel County]]'s structure. It amalgamated a series of villages into the City of Mississauga. In addition, it created the new City of Brampton from the greater portion of the Townships of Chinguacousy and [[Toronto Gore Township, Ontario|Toronto Gore]], including Bramalea and the other communities such as Claireville, Ebenezer, Victoria, Springbrook, Churchville, [[Coleraine, Ontario|Coleraine]], and Huttonville. While only [[Huttonville, Ontario|Huttonville]] and [[Churchville, Peel Regional Municipality, Ontario|Churchville]] still exist as identifiable communities, other names like Claireville are re-emerging as names of new developments.\n\nThe province converted Peel County into the [[Peel Regional Municipality, Ontario|Regional Municipality of Peel]]. Brampton retained its role as the administrative centre of Peel Region, which it already had as [[county seat]]. The regional council chamber, the [[Peel Regional Police]] force, the public health department, and the region's only major museum, the [[Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives]], are all located in Brampton.\n\nThis change had its critics among those with a strong sense of local identities. Bramptonians feared urban sprawl would dissolve their town's personality.  Bramalea residents took pride in the built-from-scratch and organised structure that had come with their new city and did not want to give it up. Others in Bramalea accept they are part of Brampton, and they make up the tri-city area: Brampton, Heart Lake, Bramalea.\n\nIn 1972, Bramalea had built its civic centre. Two years later, when Brampton and Bramalea merged, the new city's council chambers and other facilities were installed in the Bramalea building. They were moved from Brampton's modest downtown locale. The library systems of Brampton and Bramalea were joined, resulting in a system of four locations.\n\nSome have questioned the [[Regional Municipality of Peel, Ontario#The Region's future|future of Peel Region]] as encompassing all of Brampton, Mississauga, and Caledon. The Mississauga council, led by Mayor [[Hazel McCallion]], voted to become a single-tier municipality and asked the provincial government to be separated from Peel Region. They argued the city has outgrown the need for a regional layer of government, and that Mississauga is being held back by supporting Brampton and Caledon with its municipal taxes.\n\n===Development as a city===\n[[File:Main Street Brampton.jpg|thumb|Main Street in downtown Brampton]] The early 1980s brought new residential development, as Brampton released large tracts of land to developers. In 1995 the large new suburban community of Springdale was developed, contributing to what people consider urban sprawl. This area had its largest boom in 1999, when development started to appear as far north as the city's border with [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]]. The region has designated this border as the line of demarcation for urban development until 2021. Neighbouring communities not part of Peel Region have also been dramatically affected by the city's sudden spurt. Part of the boundary between Brampton and [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]], for example, is nearly completely urbanized.\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[Cineplex Odeon]] closed the Capitol Theatre in Brampton. The City bought the facility in 1981 under the leadership of councillor Diane Sutter. It adapted the former [[vaudeville]] venue and movie house as a performing arts theatre, to be used also as a live music venue. It was renamed the Heritage Theatre. Renovations and maintenance were expensive. In 1983, Toronto consultants Woods Gordon reported to the City that, rather than continue \"pouring money\" into the Heritage, they should construct a new 750-seat facility with up-to-date features. This recommendation was adopted, and the city designated the 2005/06 as the Heritage Theatre's \"grand finale\" season. The city funded construction of the new [[Rose Theatre, Brampton|Rose Theatre]], which opened in September 2006.\n\n[[Carabram]] was founded in 1982, the result of volunteers from different ethnic communities wanting to organise a festival celebrating diversity and cross-cultural friendship. The name was loosely related to Toronto's Caravan Festival of Cultures. Carabram's first event featured [[Italy|Italian]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], and [[West Indian]] pavilions. By 2003, the fair had 18 pavilions attracting 45,000 visitors. The national government of Canada had an anchor pavilion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and for Carabram's 25th Anniversary in 2009.\n\nBrampton has grown to become one of the most diverse cities in Canada. In 1996, the city was 13% South Asian and 8.2% Black.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Statistics Canada |title=Electronic Area Profiles: Brampton |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/english/census96/data/profiles/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=202027&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=35782&PRID=0&PTYPE=3&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=1996&THEME=34&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&D1=0&D2=0&D3=0&D4=0&D5=0&D6=0  |accessdate=March 7, 2019 }}</ref> By 2016, the South Asian community grew exponentially to represent 44.3% of the city's population, while the Black population grew to 14%.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Census Profile, 2016 Census\nBrampton, Ontario and Peel, Regional municipality, Ontario</ref> Responding to a growing multi-cultural population, the Peel Board of Education introduced evening [[English language learning and teaching|English as a Second Language]] (ESL) classes at high schools. Originally taught by volunteers, the classes eventually were scheduled as daytime courses taught by paid instructors. In the 1980s, the public and Catholic board expanded its languages programs, offering night classes in 23 languages. These were introduced due to requests by parents, who wanted their children to learn their ancestral languages and heritage.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mayor Ken Whillans gained approval and funding for construction of a new city hall in Brampton's downtown. The facility was designed by local architects and constructed by Inzola Construction. Whillians did not get to see the opening of the new hall because of his death in August of that same year. With the return of city government to downtown Brampton, politicians and businesses allied to revitalize the core.\n\nChanges continue to reflect the growth of the city. In 1992 the City purchased the Brampton Fairgrounds, to be used for other development. The Agricultural Society relocated in 1997 outside the boundaries of the city to Heart Lake and Old School roads. In 1997 the Health Services Restructuring Commission (HSRC) decided to amalgamate [[Georgetown Hospital|Georgetown and District Memorial Hospital]], [[Etobicoke General Hospital]], and [[Peel Memorial Hospital]] as the [[William Osler Health Centre]]. It became what is now the province's 6th-largest hospital corporation.\n\nBrampton's 2003 Sesquicentennial celebrations boosted community spirit, reviving the tradition of a summer parade (with 100 floats), and creating other initiatives. To commemorate the town's history, the city under Mayor Fennell reintroduced floral projects to the community. These have included more plantings around town, the revival in 2005 of the city Parade, and participation in the Canada [[Communities in Bloom]] project.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nBrampton has a total land area of {{convert|265|sqkm}}. The City of Brampton is bordered by Highway 50 ([[Vaughan]]) to the East, Winston Churchill Boulevard ([[Halton Hills]]) to the West, Mayfield Road ([[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]]) to the north (except for a small neighbourhood, [[Snelgrove, Ontario|Snelgrove]], which is part of Brampton despite extending somewhat north of Mayfield Road) and the [[hydro corridor]] ([[Mississauga]]) to the south except at Finch Avenue (at this point, Finch Avenue serves as the border between the two cities).\n\nBrampton features a [[continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') which is typical to much of [[Peel Region, Ontario|Peel Region]] and the rest of the Greater Toronto Area.\n\n{{Pearson Airport weatherbox}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       = 30%;\n|state       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    = Brampton annexed Chinguacousy Township\u2014including the highly populated communities of Bramalea and Heart Lake\u2014in 1974.<br />The 2011 population count was revised in 2016.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n|1858|50\n|1871|2090\n|1881|2920\n|1891|3252\n|1901|2748\n|[[Canada 1911 Census|1911]]|3412\n|1921|4527\n|1931|5532\n|1941|5975\n|1951|8389\n|1961|18467\n|1971|41211\n|1981|149030\n|1991|234445\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|268251\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|325428\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|433806\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|523906\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|593638\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=4 | Visible minority and Aboriginal population ([[Canada 2016 Census]])\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Population group!!

In 1873, with 2,000 residents, Brampton was incorporated as a town. The city was once known as \"The Flower Town of Canada\", a title based on its large [[greenhouse]] industry. Today, Brampton's major economic sectors include advanced manufacturing, [[retail]] administration, [[logistics]], [[information and communication technologies|information, and communication technologies]], food and beverage, [[life sciences]], and business services. Mass [[Immigration to Canada|immigration]] notably from the [[Indian subcontinent]] has greatly increased Brampton's population \u2013 from 10,000 in the 1950s to over 600,000 today.\n\n==History==\n[[File:John Haggert.gif|thumb|right|upright|[[John Haggert]], Brampton's first mayor]]\n\n{{main|History of Brampton}}\n{{see also|List of mayors of Brampton|Brampton Fall Fair|Brampton Library}}\n\nPrior to the 1800s, all real business in [[Chinguacousy Township, Ontario|Chinguacousy Township]] took place at Martin Salisbury's tavern. One mile distant at the corner of Main and Queen streets, now the recognised centre of Brampton, William Buffy's tavern was the only significant building.  At the time, the area was referred to as \"Buffy's Corners\". By 1834, John Elliott laid out the area in lots for sale, calling it \"Brampton\", which was soon adopted by others.<ref name=100years>\"Brampton's Beginning\" in ''Bramptons's 100th Anniversary as an Incorporated Town: 1873\u20131973'', Brampton: The Corporation of the Town of Brampton and the Brampton Centennial Committee, 1973, originally published in Ross Cumming, ed., ''Historical Atlas of Peel County'', n.p.: Walker and Miles, 1877.</ref>\n\nIn 1853, a small agricultural fair was set up by the newly initiated County Agricultural Society of the County of Peel, and was held at the corner of Main and Queen streets. Grains, produce, roots, and dairy products were up for sale. Horses and cattle, along with other lesser livestock, were also sold at market. This agricultural fair eventually became the modern [[Brampton Fall Fair]].\n\nIn that same year Brampton was incorporated as a village.<ref name=100years /> In 1866, the town became the county seat and the location of the [[Peel County Courthouse]] which was built in 1865-66; a three-storey County gaol was added at the rear in 1867.\n\nEdward Dale, an immigrant from [[Dorking]], England, established a flower nursery in Brampton<ref name=\"nursery\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.brampton.ca/en/Arts-Culture-Tourism/heritage/Pages/Brampton's-History.aspx\n  | title = Discover Brampton's History\n  | publisher = City of Brampton\n  | accessdate = 2010-04-08\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100221032242/http://www.brampton.ca/en/Arts-Culture-Tourism/heritage/Pages/Brampton%27s-History.aspx\n  | archivedate = 2010-02-21\n  }}</ref> shortly after his arrival in 1863.<ref name=\"bost\" /> Dale's Nursery became the town's largest<ref name=\"nursery\" /> and most prominent employer, developed a flower grading system,<ref name=\"bost\" /> and established a global export market for its products.<ref name=\"nursery\" /> The company [[chimney]] was a town landmark,<ref name=\"bost\" /> until [[Brampton City Council|Brampton Town Council]] allowed it to be torn down in 1977.<ref name=\"bost\" /> At its height, the company had 140 greenhouses,<ref name=\"acresof\">{{cite book\n |url          = http://acresofglass.com/\n |title        = Acres of Glass: The Story of the Dale Estate and How Brampton Became \"The Flower Town of Canada\"\n |last         = O'Hara\n |first        = Dale\n |publisher    = Eastendbooks\n |date         = September 2007\n |isbn         = 978-1-896973-39-5\n |accessdate   = 2010-04-08\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619202006/http://www.acresofglass.com/\n |archive-date = 2009-06-19\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref> and was the largest [[Floriculture|cut flower]] business in North America,<ref name=\"floriculture\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.catchthespiritbrampton.com/flowertown.php\n  | title = Brampton's FlowerTown Heritage\n  | accessdate = 2010-04-08\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708123544/http://www.catchthespiritbrampton.com/flowertown.php\n  | archivedate = 2011-07-08\n  }}</ref> producing 20 million blooms and introducing numerous rose and orchid varietals and species to the market.<ref name=\"floriculture\" /> It also spurred the development of other nurseries in the town.

In 1907, the library received a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, set up by United States steel [[magnate]] and [[philanthropist]] [[Andrew Carnegie]], to build a new, expanded library; it serves several purposes, featuring the [[Brampton Library]]. The [[Carnegie libraries]] were built on the basis of communities coming up with matching funds and guaranteeing maintenance.\n\nIn 1902, Sir [[William James Gage|William J.

After several meetings in Clairville Hall, they decided to found the County of Peel Farmers Mutual Fire Insurance Company. In 1955, when the company moved to its third and current location, 103 Queen Street West, it took the new name of Peel Mutual Insurance Company. It reigns as the longest-running company in modern Brampton. Harmsworth Decorating Centre was established in 1890, as Harmsworth and Son, operated out of the family's house on Queen Street West. The current location was purchased on September 1, 1904, after a fire destroyed their original store. Purchased for $1,400, the 24 Main Street South location is the longest-operating retail business in what is now Brampton.\n\nIn 1974, the two townships of Chinguacousy and Toronto Gore were incorporated into Brampton. The small pine added to the centre of the shield on the Brampton city flag represents Chinguacousy, honouring the [[Chippewa]] chief ''Shinguacose,'' \"The Small Pine.\" After this merger, outlying communities such as [[Bramalea, Ontario|Bramalea]], [[Heart Lake (Ontario)|Heart Lake]] and [[Professor's Lake]], [[Snelgrove, Ontario|Snelgrove]], [[Tullamore, Ontario|Tullamore]], and [[Mayfield, Ontario|Mayfield]], were developed.\n\nIn 1963, the town established ''The Flower Festival of Brampton'', based on the ''[[Portland Rose Festival|Rose Festival]]'' of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] in the United States.

Located in the former [[Chinguacousy Township, Ontario|Chinguacousy Township]], it was Canada's first satellite community developed by one of the country's largest real estate developers, ''Bramalea Limited.'' The name \"Bramalea\" was created by the farmer William Sheard, who combined \"BRAM\" from Brampton, \"MAL\" from Malton (then a neighbouring town which is now part of the city of [[Mississauga]]), and \"LEA\", an [[Old English]] word meaning meadow or grassland.  He sold the land to Brampton Leasing (the former name of the developer) and built one of Bramalea's first houses on Dixie Road.\n\nThe community was developed according to its detailed [[Strategic planning|master plan]], which included provisions for a parkland trail system and a \"downtown\" to include essential services and a [[shopping centre]]. The downtown's centrepiece was the Civic Centre, built in 1972 to include the city hall and library. Directly across Team Canada Drive, a shopping centre named [[Bramalea City Centre]] was built. These developments were connected by a long tunnel, planned to provide protection from winter weather. But, the tunnel has long since been closed due to safety issues. Urbanists have also found that pedestrians at street level make for much livelier and safer streets. Other features included a police station, fire hall, bus terminal, and a collection of seniors' retirement homes.\n\nEach phase of the new city was marked with progressing first letters of [[street name]]s. Development started with the \"A\" section, with street names such as Argyle, Avondale, and Aloma. Developers then created a \"B\" section, \"C\" section, and so forth. Children on the boundaries of these divisions would regularly compete in street hockey games, pitting, for example, the \"D\" section versus the \"E\" section.\n\nThe community was initially developed with a large number of recreational facilities, including tennis courts, playgrounds, hockey/lacrosse rinks and swimming pools. An extensive parkland trail and sidewalk system connects the entire community.\n\n===Region of Peel===\n[[File:pelbrm.PNG|thumb|right|Brampton in the Region of Peel]]\n[[File:Brampton City Hall.jpg|thumb|Brampton's City Hall]]\n\nIn 1974, the Ontario provincial government decided to update [[Peel County, Ontario|Peel County]]'s structure. It amalgamated a series of villages into the City of Mississauga. In addition, it created the new City of Brampton from the greater portion of the Townships of Chinguacousy and [[Toronto Gore Township, Ontario|Toronto Gore]], including Bramalea and the other communities such as Claireville, Ebenezer, Victoria, Springbrook, Churchville, [[Coleraine, Ontario|Coleraine]], and Huttonville. While only [[Huttonville, Ontario|Huttonville]] and [[Churchville, Peel Regional Municipality, Ontario|Churchville]] still exist as identifiable communities, other names like Claireville are re-emerging as names of new developments.\n\nThe province converted Peel County into the [[Peel Regional Municipality, Ontario|Regional Municipality of Peel]]. Brampton retained its role as the administrative centre of Peel Region, which it already had as [[county seat]]. The regional council chamber, the [[Peel Regional Police]] force, the public health department, and the region's only major museum, the [[Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives]], are all located in Brampton.\n\nThis change had its critics among those with a strong sense of local identities. Bramptonians feared urban sprawl would dissolve their town's personality.  Bramalea residents took pride in the built-from-scratch and organised structure that had come with their new city and did not want to give it up. Others in Bramalea accept they are part of Brampton, and they make up the tri-city area: Brampton, Heart Lake, Bramalea.\n\nIn 1972, Bramalea had built its civic centre. Two years later, when Brampton and Bramalea merged, the new city's council chambers and other facilities were installed in the Bramalea building. They were moved from Brampton's modest downtown locale. The library systems of Brampton and Bramalea were joined, resulting in a system of four locations.\n\nSome have questioned the [[Regional Municipality of Peel, Ontario#The Region's future|future of Peel Region]] as encompassing all of Brampton, Mississauga, and Caledon. The Mississauga council, led by Mayor [[Hazel McCallion]], voted to become a single-tier municipality and asked the provincial government to be separated from Peel Region. They argued the city has outgrown the need for a regional layer of government, and that Mississauga is being held back by supporting Brampton and Caledon with its municipal taxes.\n\n===Development as a city===\n[[File:Main Street Brampton.jpg|thumb|Main Street in downtown Brampton]] The early 1980s brought new residential development, as Brampton released large tracts of land to developers. In 1995 the large new suburban community of Springdale was developed, contributing to what people consider urban sprawl. This area had its largest boom in 1999, when development started to appear as far north as the city's border with [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]]. The region has designated this border as the line of demarcation for urban development until 2021. Neighbouring communities not part of Peel Region have also been dramatically affected by the city's sudden spurt. Part of the boundary between Brampton and [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]], for example, is nearly completely urbanized.\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[Cineplex Odeon]] closed the Capitol Theatre in Brampton. The City bought the facility in 1981 under the leadership of councillor Diane Sutter. It adapted the former [[vaudeville]] venue and movie house as a performing arts theatre, to be used also as a live music venue. It was renamed the Heritage Theatre. Renovations and maintenance were expensive. In 1983, Toronto consultants Woods Gordon reported to the City that, rather than continue \"pouring money\" into the Heritage, they should construct a new 750-seat facility with up-to-date features. This recommendation was adopted, and the city designated the 2005/06 as the Heritage Theatre's \"grand finale\" season. The city funded construction of the new [[Rose Theatre, Brampton|Rose Theatre]], which opened in September 2006.\n\n[[Carabram]] was founded in 1982, the result of volunteers from different ethnic communities wanting to organise a festival celebrating diversity and cross-cultural friendship. The name was loosely related to Toronto's Caravan Festival of Cultures. Carabram's first event featured [[Italy|Italian]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], and [[West Indian]] pavilions. By 2003, the fair had 18 pavilions attracting 45,000 visitors. The national government of Canada had an anchor pavilion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and for Carabram's 25th Anniversary in 2009.\n\nBrampton has grown to become one of the most diverse cities in Canada. In 1996, the city was 13% South Asian and 8.2% Black.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Statistics Canada |title=Electronic Area Profiles: Brampton |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/english/census96/data/profiles/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=202027&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=35782&PRID=0&PTYPE=3&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=1996&THEME=34&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&D1=0&D2=0&D3=0&D4=0&D5=0&D6=0  |accessdate=March 7, 2019 }}</ref> By 2016, the South Asian community grew exponentially to represent 44.3% of the city's population, while the Black population grew to 14%.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Census Profile, 2016 Census\nBrampton, Ontario and Peel, Regional municipality, Ontario</ref> Responding to a growing multi-cultural population, the Peel Board of Education introduced evening [[English language learning and teaching|English as a Second Language]] (ESL) classes at high schools. Originally taught by volunteers, the classes eventually were scheduled as daytime courses taught by paid instructors. In the 1980s, the public and Catholic board expanded its languages programs, offering night classes in 23 languages. These were introduced due to requests by parents, who wanted their children to learn their ancestral languages and heritage.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mayor Ken Whillans gained approval and funding for construction of a new city hall in Brampton's downtown. The facility was designed by local architects and constructed by Inzola Construction. Whillians did not get to see the opening of the new hall because of his death in August of that same year. With the return of city government to downtown Brampton, politicians and businesses allied to revitalize the core.\n\nChanges continue to reflect the growth of the city. In 1992 the City purchased the Brampton Fairgrounds, to be used for other development. The Agricultural Society relocated in 1997 outside the boundaries of the city to Heart Lake and Old School roads. In 1997 the Health Services Restructuring Commission (HSRC) decided to amalgamate [[Georgetown Hospital|Georgetown and District Memorial Hospital]], [[Etobicoke General Hospital]], and [[Peel Memorial Hospital]] as the [[William Osler Health Centre]]. It became what is now the province's 6th-largest hospital corporation.\n\nBrampton's 2003 Sesquicentennial celebrations boosted community spirit, reviving the tradition of a summer parade (with 100 floats), and creating other initiatives. To commemorate the town's history, the city under Mayor Fennell reintroduced floral projects to the community. These have included more plantings around town, the revival in 2005 of the city Parade, and participation in the Canada [[Communities in Bloom]] project.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nBrampton has a total land area of {{convert|265|sqkm}}. The City of Brampton is bordered by Highway 50 ([[Vaughan]]) to the East, Winston Churchill Boulevard ([[Halton Hills]]) to the West, Mayfield Road ([[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]]) to the north (except for a small neighbourhood, [[Snelgrove, Ontario|Snelgrove]], which is part of Brampton despite extending somewhat north of Mayfield Road) and the [[hydro corridor]] ([[Mississauga]]) to the south except at Finch Avenue (at this point, Finch Avenue serves as the border between the two cities).\n\nBrampton features a [[continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') which is typical to much of [[Peel Region, Ontario|Peel Region]] and the rest of the Greater Toronto Area.\n\n{{Pearson Airport weatherbox}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       = 30%;\n|state       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    = Brampton annexed Chinguacousy Township\u2014including the highly populated communities of Bramalea and Heart Lake\u2014in 1974.<br />The 2011 population count was revised in 2016.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n|1858|50\n|1871|2090\n|1881|2920\n|1891|3252\n|1901|2748\n|[[Canada 1911 Census|1911]]|3412\n|1921|4527\n|1931|5532\n|1941|5975\n|1951|8389\n|1961|18467\n|1971|41211\n|1981|149030\n|1991|234445\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|268251\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|325428\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|433806\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|523906\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|593638\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=4 | Visible minority and Aboriginal population ([[Canada 2016 Census]])\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Population group!!
