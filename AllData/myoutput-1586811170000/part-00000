However, his resolution to the grandfather paradox is considered unsatisfactory to some people, because it states the time traveller reenters another [[Many-worlds interpretation|parallel universe]], and that the actual [[quantum state]] is a [[quantum superposition]] of states where the time traveller does and does not exist.\n\nHe made the simplifying assumption that we can split the quantum system into a subsystem A external to the closed timelike curve, and a CTC part. Also, he assumed that we can combine all the time evolution between the exterior and the CTC into a single [[unitary operator]] ''U''. This presupposes the [[Schr\u00f6dinger picture]]. We have a [[tensor product]] for the combined state of both systems. He makes the further assumption there is no correlation between the initial density state of A and the density state of the CTC. This assumption is not time-symmetric, which he tried to justify by appealing to measurement theory and the second law of thermodynamics. He proposed that the density state restricted to the CTC is a fixed-point of\n:<math>\\rho_{\\text{CTC}} = \\text{Tr}_A \\left[ U \\left( \\rho_A \\otimes \\rho_{\\text{CTC}} \\right) U^\\dagger\\right]</math>.\nHe showed that such [[Renormalization group|fixed points]] always exist. He justified this choice by noting the [[expectation value]] of any CTC observable will match after a loop. However, this could lead to \"multivalued\" histories if memory is preserved around the loop. In particular, his prescription is incompatible with [[path integral formulation|path integrals]] unless we allow for multivalued fields. Another point to note is in general, we have more than one fixed point, and this leads to [[Indeterminism|nondeterminism]] in the time evolution. He suggested the solution use is the one with the [[maximum entropy principle|maximum entropy]]. The final external state is given by <math>\\text{Tr}_{\\text{CTC}} \\left[ U \\left( \\rho_A \\otimes \\rho_{\\text{CTC}} \\right) U^\\dagger\\right]</math>. Pure states can evolve into mixed states.\n\nThis leads to seemingly paradoxical resolutions to the grandfather paradox. Assume the external subsystem is irrelevant, and only a qubit travels in the CTC. Also, assume during the course around the time machine, the value of the qubit is flipped according to the unitary operator\n:<math>U = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}</math>.\nThe most general fixed-point solution is given by\n:<math>\\rho_{\\text{CTC}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{1}{2} & a\\\\a & \\frac{1}{2}\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nwhere ''a'' is a real number between <math>-1/2</math> and <math>1/2</math>. This is an example of the nonuniqueness of solutions. The solution maximizing the [[von Neumann entropy]] is given by <math>a=0</math>. We can think of this as a mixture (not superposition) between the states <math>\\left( \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle + \\left| 1 \\right\\rangle \\right)/\\sqrt{2}</math> and <math>\\left( \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle - \\left| 1 \\right\\rangle \\right)/\\sqrt{2}</math>. This leads to an interesting interpretation that if the qubit starts off with a value of 0, it will end up with a value of 1, and vice versa, but this should not be problematic according to Deutsch because the qubit ends up in a different parallel universe in the [[many worlds interpretation]].\n\nLater researchers have noted that if his prescription turned out to be right, computers in the vicinity of a time machine can solve [[PSPACE-complete]] problems.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1        = Aaronson\n| first1       = Scott\n| authorlink1  = Scott Aaronson\n| last2        = Watrous\n| first2       = John\n| authorlink2  = John Watrous (computer scientist)\n|date=Feb 2009\n| title        = Closed Timelike Curves Make Quantum and Classical Computing Equivalent\n| journal      = Proceedings of the Royal Society\n| volume       = 465\n| issue        = 2102\n| series       = A\n| pages        = 631\u2013647\n| arxiv        = 0808.2669\n| bibcode      = 2009RSPSA.465..631A\n| doi          = 10.1098/rspa.2008.0350\n}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it was shown in an article by Tolksdorf and Verch that Deutsch's CTC fixed point condition can be fulfilled to arbitrary precision in any quantum system described according to relativistic [[quantum field theory]] on spacetimes where CTCs are excluded, casting doubts on whether Deutsch's condition is really characteristic of quantum processes mimicking CTCs in the sense of [[general relativity]].<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1        = Tolksdorf\n| first1       = Juergen\n| authorlink1  = \n| last2        = Verch\n| first2       = Rainer\n| authorlink2  = \n|date=2018\n| title        = Quantum physics, fields and closed timelike curves: The D-CTC condition in quantum field theory\n| journal      = Communications in Mathematical Physics\n| volume       = 357\n| issue        = 1\n| series       = \n| pages        = 319\u2013351\n| arxiv        = 1609.01496\n| bibcode      =2018CMaPh.357..319T \n| doi          =  10.1007/s00220-017-2943-5\n}}</ref>\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|study in quantum mechanics}}\nUntil recently, most studies on [[time travel]] are based upon [[classical physics|classical]] [[general relativity]].

Each time traveling qubit has an associated [[negentropy]], given approximately by the logarithm of the noise of the communication channel. Each use of the time machine can be used to extract as much work from a thermal bath. In a brute force search for a randomly generated password, the entropy of the unknown string can be effectively reduced by a similar amount. Because the negentropy and computational power diverge as the noise term goes to zero, complexity class may not be the best way to describe the capabilities of time machines.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Novikov self-consistency principle]]\n* [[Grandfather paradox]]\n* [[Ontological paradox]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Quantum mechanics topics}}\n{{Time travel}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quantum Mechanics Of Time Travel}}\n[[Category:Time travel]]\n[[Category:Quantum mechanics]]\n[[Category:Quantum gravity]]\n", "name_user": "24.188.48.103", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(BOIII)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics_of_time_travel"}
