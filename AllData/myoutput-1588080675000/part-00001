The show was the creation of producer [[Robert Maxwell (producer)|Robert Maxwell]] and animal trainer [[Rudd Weatherwax]] and was televised from September 12, 1954, to March 25, 1973. The [[list of longest-running U.S. primetime television series|fifth longest-running U.S. primetime television series]] after ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' and ''[[Law & Order]]'', the show ran for 17 seasons on [[CBS]] before entering [[Television syndication|first-run syndication]] for its final two seasons. Initially filmed in black and white, the show transitioned to color in 1965.\n\nThe show's first 10 seasons follow Lassie's adventures in a fictional small [[farming|farming community]]. Eleven-year-old Jeff Miller, his mother Ellen, and his grandfather are Lassie's first human companions until seven-year-old Timmy Martin and his adoptive parents take over in the fourth season. When Lassie's exploits on the farm end in the eleventh season, she finds new adventures in the wilderness alongside [[United States Forest Service]] Rangers. After traveling on her own for a year, Lassie finally settles at a children's home for her final two syndicated seasons.\n\n''Lassie'' received critical favor at its debut and won two [[Emmy Award]]s in its first years. Stars [[Jan Clayton]] and [[June Lockhart]] were nominated for Emmys. Merchandise produced during the show's run included books, a [[Halloween]] costume, clothing, toys, and other items. [[Campbell's Soup Company|Campbell's Soup]], the show's lifelong sponsor, offered two premiums (a ring and a wallet), and distributed thousands to fans. A multi-part episode was edited into the feature film ''Lassie's Great Adventure'' and released in August 1963. Selected episodes have been released to DVD.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Concept and development===\nBetween 1943 and 1951, fictional collie [[Lassie]] was the inspiration for seven feature films produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].<ref name=\"Jenkins\">[[#Jenkins|Jenkins]]</ref> With completion of the seventh film in 1951, MGM planned no further films for the Lassie character or [[Pal (dog)|Pal]], the male dog actor who portrayed Lassie. In lieu of $40,000 back pay owed him by MGM, Pal's owner and trainer [[Rudd Weatherwax]] was given all rights to the Lassie trademark and name. Weatherwax and Pal, appearing as Lassie, began to perform at county fairs, carnivals,  rodeos, and other venues.<ref name=\"Col76-8\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.76\u20138</ref>\n\nNeeding material for the relatively new medium of television, producer [[Robert Maxwell (producer)|Robert Maxwell]] sold Weatherwax on the concept of a Lassie television series with a boy and his dog theme. The two men developed a scenario about a struggling war widow, her young son, and her father-in-law set on a weather-beaten, modern-day American farm.<ref name=\"Col78-9\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.78\u20139</ref> Two pilots were filmed in [[Calgary, Alberta]], Canada with the first telling the story of the bond forged between boy and dog, and the second filmed to give potential sponsors and network buyers an idea of a typical episode. After viewing the pilots, [[CBS]] put the show on its fall 1954 schedule.<ref name=\"Col81\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.81</ref> [[Campbell's Soup Company]] signed on early as the show's sole sponsor and remained so for the show's entire 19 season  run.<ref name=\"Col83\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.83</ref><ref group=\"note\">As word spread through the Hollywood community about the series, MGM began legal action,  halting production and alleging copyright infringement. The studio claimed it still owned the Lassie trademark and name. Before court action began, Weatherwax was able to produce documentation proving that MGM had given him all rights to Lassie. ([[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.81\u20132)</ref> Filming for the series began in the summer of 1954, and ''Lassie'' made its d\u00e9but Sunday, September 12, 1954, at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]], a time slot the show would call home on CBS for the next seventeen years.<ref name=\"Col82-3\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.82\u20133</ref><ref name=\"Stevens\">[[#Stevens|Stevens]]</ref>\n\nIn 1957, [[Jack Wrather]], owner of the hit television series ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' and ''[[Sergeant Preston of the Yukon]]'' purchased all rights to the ''Lassie'' television show for $3.25 million, and guided the show through its next several seasons.<ref name=\"Col96\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.96</ref>  As 1964 and the show's eleventh season approached, the decision was made to completely rework the show; the boy and his dog theme was dropped and Lassie was teamed with a succession of [[United States Forest Service]] workers. The show focused on [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] and [[environmentalism]], but its relevance in a time of social change was questioned. The show began a steady decline in ratings.<ref name=\"Jenkins\" /><ref name=\"Col150,156\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.150,156</ref> In 1971, [[Prime Time Access Rule|new rulings]] regarding network [[prime time]] scheduling were handed down from the [[Federal Communications Commission]], and CBS canceled the show. ''Lassie'' then entered first-run syndication for two seasons before televising its last new episode on Sunday March 25, 1973.<ref name=\"Col172-3\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.172\u20133</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Jan Clayton and George Cleveland Lassie 1956.JPG|thumb|175px|right|Original series stars [[Jan Clayton]] (as Ellen Miller) and [[George Cleveland]] (as Gramps).

Thereafter, five of Pal's male descendants played the role. His son Lassie Junior performed through the Jeff years and first two Timmy years before retiring in 1959 to battle cancer. Though he recovered, Lassie Junior never worked the show again.<ref name=\"Col6\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.6</ref> His son Spook was rushed into the series while his brother Baby was in training for the role. Spook was inadequately prepared and never became comfortable on the set after an overhead light crashed to the floor on his first day. Weatherwax, however, coaxed a natural and seemingly confident performance from the nervous dog, and some regard Spook's portrayal as Weatherwax's finest work.<ref name=\"Col128\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.128</ref> Spook played the role in the spring and fall of 1960.<ref name=\"Col6\" /> Baby, son of Lassie Junior and brother to Spook, worked the show for six years. He appeared in the last Timmy years, and two of the Forest Service seasons. Baby died at just eight years of age, the only Lassie not to live at least seventeen years. He was followed in the role by Mire who played Lassie for five years. He portrayed the fictional collie in the syndicated seasons.<ref name=\"Col6-7\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.6\u20137</ref>\n\nBroadway star and quiz show panelist [[Jan Clayton]] was hired to play farm widow [[Ellen Miller (Lassie)|Ellen Miller]] with septuagenarian [[George Cleveland]] playing her father-in-law, George \"Gramps\" Miller. Child actor [[Tommy Rettig]] was hired to portray Ellen\u2019s eleven-year-old son Jeff Miller,<ref name=\"Col80-1\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.80\u20131</ref><ref group=\"note\">Rettig competed with two other boys for the role of Jeff Miller. The three juvenile actors spent a week at Rudd Weatherwax's home in [[North Hollywood, California]] with Pal, and, as Rettig recalled, \"Lassie liked me better than the other two kids. I loved animals, and this seemed to be very important to Rudd.\" Rettig won the role. ([[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.80\u20131).</ref> and Donald Keeler (the professional name used at the time by [[Joey D. Vieira]]) was cast as Jeff's friend, Sylvester \"Porky\" Brockway. Porky's [[basset hound]] Pokey became a recurring animal character through the first several seasons.<ref name=\"Col86\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.86</ref>\n\nIn 1957, Both Clayton and Rettig wanted to leave the show.<ref name=\"Col98\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.98</ref> Producers decided to find a new boy and ease the Miller family out of the show.<ref name=\"Stevens\" /> Two hundred boys were interviewed, and six-year-old film veteran [[Jon Provost]] was hired and made his d\u00e9but as [[Timmy Martin (television character)|Timmy]] in the fourth season opener, \"The Runaway.\"<ref name=\"Col100-1\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.100\u20131</ref> In July 1957, George Cleveland died suddenly, and producers were forced to overhaul the entire show.<ref name=\"Stevens\" /> The plot was extensively reworked, and Clayton and Rettig were completely dropped. [[Cloris Leachman]] and [[Jon Shepodd]] were quickly hired as Timmy\u2019s foster parents [[Ruth Martin (television character)|Ruth]] and [[Paul Martin (Lassie)|Paul Martin]].<ref name=\"Col103-4\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.103\u20134</ref> In the fourth season, [[George Chandler]] was hired to play Petrie Martin, Paul's uncle, but the character was later dropped.<ref name=\"Col107,119\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.107,119</ref> As fourth season shooting progressed, Leachman grew unhappy playing a somber farm woman, feuded on-set with co-workers, and proved unpopular with viewers. Ratings dropped. When filming was completed for the 1957\u201358 season in February 1958, Wrather severed ties with producer Maxwell and dropped Leachman and Shepodd.<ref>[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.105,110</ref> Film veteran [[June Lockhart]] and Broadway stage star [[Hugh Reilly]] replaced Leachman and Sheppod as Ruth and Paul Martin at the top of the fifth season.<ref name=\"Col112,114\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.112,114</ref> Todd Ferrell played Timmy's friend Ralph \"Boomer\" Bates with his dog Mike a recurring character but both were dropped in 1959.<ref name=\"Jenkins\"/><ref name=\"Col119-20\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.119\u201320</ref>\n\nFormer [[Keystone Kop]] [[Andy Clyde]], also a co-star of ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', became a regular in 1959 as neighbor Cully Wilson.<ref name=\"Col129\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.129</ref>\n\nGuest stars during the Timmy years included \"[[Clayton Moore|The Lone Ranger]]\", Baseball player [[Roy Campanella]], Olympian [[Rafer Johnson]],<ref name=\"Col133,143\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.133,143</ref> [[Stacy Keach]], [[Marie Windsor]], [[Dick Foran]], [[Tod Griffin]], [[Jane Darwell]], [[Denver Pyle]], [[Fuzzy Knight]], [[Harry Carey, Jr.]], [[William Schallert]], [[Ellen Corby]], and [[Karl Swenson]].<ref name=\"Pro135\">[[#Provost|Provost]] 2007, p.135</ref>\n\nDuring its first four years, ''Lassie'' received very decent ratings. However, at the end of the 1958\u20131959 season, the ratings had fallen from  the top 30, likely due to the constant turnover in the cast. Once viewers began to warm to Lockhart and Reilly as Timmy's parents, the Martin family was accepted and embraced by the public. As a result, between 1960 and 1964, ''Lassie'''s ratings greatly improved and by the spring of 1964, it received its highest rating ever, ranking at #13.\n[[File:Lassie 1957 cast photo.JPG|thumb|175px|[[Jon Shepodd]] and [[Cloris Leachman]] originally played Paul and Ruth Martin in the final twenty eight episodes of season 4.]]\n[[File:Lassie 1960 cast photo.JPG|thumb|175px|...but were replaced after season 4  by [[Hugh Reilly]] and [[June Lockhart]] respectively.]]\nIn 1964, Provost declined to renew his contract.<ref name=\"Col148\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.148</ref> Producers decided to broaden the show's demographics to appeal to older viewers,<ref name=\"Stevens\" /> and, to that end, dropped the boy and his dog theme for a plot featuring a Forest Service Ranger.<ref name=\"Col150\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.150</ref> [[Robert Bray]], a former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] and [[Gary Cooper]] look-alike was cast as Corey Stuart.<ref name=\"Jenkins\" /> During Bray's first year, the show transitioned to color filming and spectacular scenic locations across America were exploited as settings for the show.<ref name=\"Col156-8\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.156\u20138</ref> Eventually, Bray's long battle with [[alcoholism]] forced him from the show,<ref name=\"Col163\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.163</ref> and Jack De Mave and [[Jed Allan]] were hired to replace him.<ref name=\"Col163-4\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.163\u20134</ref>\n\nGuest stars during the Ranger years included [[Ken Osmond]], [[Paul Petersen]], [[Suzanne Somers]], [[Victor French]], Leo Gordon, and [[Morgan Brittany]].<ref name=\"Col169\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.169</ref>  When the Forest Service years came to an end, Lassie wandered the country on her own for a season then settled at the Holden ranch for her final two syndicated seasons with costars [[Ron Hayes]], [[Larry Pennell]], Skip Burton, [[Larry Wilcox]], [[Sherry Boucher]], and [[Pamelyn Ferdin]].<ref name=\"Jenkins\" /><ref name=\"Col172-3\"/>\n\n====Narration====\nWrather's wife, and series associate producer [[Bonita Granville|Bonita Granville Wrather]] narrated numerous episodes throughout the run of the series, usually the beginning and/or ending of multi-part episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://episodes.lassieweb.org/lassie08.htm|title=Wrather narration|publisher=Lassie Web|accessdate=2014-07-26}}</ref>\n\n===Writers===\nNovelist [[Inez Asher]] was among those who wrote for the series, while other scripts were produced by writers blacklisted during the heyday of [[McCarthyism]] and the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. These writers included [[Robert Lees]] (credited as J. E. Selby) and [[Adrian Scott]], one of the [[Hollywood Ten]] who went to prison for contempt of the [[United States Congress]]. His wife, [[Joan Scott (screenwriter)|Joan Scott]] writing as ''Joanne Court'', attended story conferences and gave her husband notes so he could do rewrites.<ref name=\"Barron\" />\n\n===Filming===\nThe show's first studio was Stage One of KTTV in [[Los Angeles, California]],<ref name=\"Col82\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.82</ref> with the production moving to [[Desilu]] in 1957.<ref name=\"Pro68\">[[#Provost|Provost]] 2007, p.68</ref> [[Franklin Canyon Reservoir]] and [[Vasquez Rocks]] saw location shootings.<ref name=\"Pro42\">[[#Provost|Provost]] 2007, p.42</ref> During the Timmy seasons, episodes were filmed at the [[Grand Canyon]] and in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|High Sierra]],<ref name=\"Col137\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.137,146</ref> and, during the Forest Service seasons, the Forest Service and the  [[Department of the Interior]] offered [[Alaska]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Washington Monument]] and other sites for location shoots.<ref name=\"Col154\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.154</ref>\n\nFifteen pages were filmed per day, six days a week, with three shows completed per week. Shooting in order was not possible. Several barn segments might be filmed at a particular time with the crew then moving on to film an equal number of kitchen scenes. The shots may have then been used in four or five different episodes. Rettig was allowed to bond with the dog and often groomed the dog at the studio or spent weekends at Weatherwax's home playing with the animal. The bond translated to film, making the boy and dog scenes more believable, but, eventually the dog developed divided loyalties (looking to Rettig for direction rather than Weatherwax) and the trainer was forced to curtail the amount of time boy and dog spent together.<ref name=\"Col89-91\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.89\u201391</ref>\n\nTypically, there were two dog trainers on the set, each teetering on a stepladder only Lassie could see and waving a chunk of meat at the dog. \"It would look as though Lassie was looking at Jon (Provost), but he was really looking past Jon at the piece of beef\",<ref name=\"Barron\" /> Lockhart recalled in 2004. When Provost delivered his line, the trainer behind Lockhart would whisper \"Lassie!\" and wave another piece of meat. Lassie's head would turn to Lockhart who would deliver her line. Then the trainer behind Provost would get Lassie's attention again, and Provost would deliver his next line. \"The sound editor would cut out all that,\" Lockhart said, \"You finally got to where you never heard the trainers. Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it.\" In addition to the main Lassie, three other Lassies might be involved in an episode shoot: a stand-in for rehearsals, a stunt double, and a \"fighter\" for scenes involving battles with other animals.<ref name=\"Barron\" />\n\n===Theme music===\n''Lassie'' used several pieces of theme music during its long broadcast history. For the first season, \"Secret of the Silent Hills (Theme from the Lassie TV series)\", is used for both the opening and ending theme. Composed by [[William Lava]], the orchestral theme was originally created for the 1940 radio show ''The Courageous Dr. Christian''.<ref name=\"Lassie /Jeffs Collie /Timmy and Lassie\">Lassie /Jeffs Collie /Timmy and Lassie</ref>\n\nFor the second and third season a variation of this theme, titled simply \"Lassie Main & End Title\", was used for the opening and ending theme. [[Raoul Kraushaar]], the music director for the series, is the listed composer for the theme; however the changes he made to the original are so slight that only a trained ear can tell the difference. The third theme used for the series is an orchestral rendition of the [[aria]], \"Dio Possente\" (Even Bravest Hearts May Swell) from [[Charles Gounod]]'s opera, ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''. The exact time this theme started being used is uncertain due to conflicting records; however it is agreed that it was the third series, and was used for at least part of season four for the change of ownership of Lassie.<ref name=\"Lassie /Jeffs Collie /Timmy and Lassie\" />\n\nThe most famous of the Lassie theme songs appeared at the start of the fifth season. Copyrighted as \"Lassie Main & End Title\", the song was created by [[Les Baxter]], with the whistling itself performed by [[Muzzy Marcellino]]. Nicknamed \"The Whistler,\" it remained the series theme for the rest of the \"Martin years\". With the coming of the \"Ranger years\", the opening and ending theme was changed to [[Nathan Scott]]'s arrangement of the traditional folk tune ''[[Greensleeves]]''. An orchestral \"Whistler\" returned for the series theme during the thirteenth season for the seven-part \"Voyager\" episode, and would remain the series theme for the rest of its run.<ref name=\"Lassie /Jeffs Collie /Timmy and Lassie\" /> Television composer [[Nathan Scott (composer)|Nathan Scott]] scored the music to nearly every episode between 1963 and 1973,<ref name=variety>{{cite news|first=Jon|last=Burlingame|title=Nathan Scott, 94, scored TV shows&nbsp;\u2013 Composer's credits included 'Dragnet,' 'Lassie' |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118016005.html?categoryid=25&cs=1 |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=March 3, 2010 |accessdate=March 10, 2010}}</ref> except for four episodes.<ref name=latimes>{{cite news|first=Dennis|last=McClellan|title=Nathan Scott dies at 94; film and TV composer, arranger and conductor |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/04/local/la-me-nathan-scott5-2010mar05 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc|Tribune Publishing]]|date=March 4, 2010 |accessdate=March 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Sponsor===\n[[Campbell's Soup Company]] sponsored the entire nineteen-year run of ''Lassie''. In one of the first instances of [[product placement]], the company asked that their products be visible on the set and so, in episode after episode, Campbell's products are seen in background shots. Campbell's also contractually required the show's stars to avoid appearing in any film or theatrical production that undermined their All-American images.<ref name=\"Col83,85,115,136\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.83,85,115,136</ref>\n\nIn 1956, the company held a \"Name Lassie's Puppies\" contest with the grand prizes being Lassie's pups and $2,000. Company executives hand-delivered puppies to the winner's homes.<ref name=\"Col93-4\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.93\u20134</ref> In 1958, for twenty-five cents and a label from a Swanson's frozen dinner, viewers could receive a Lassie portrait friendship ring based on one that Uncle Petrie fashions for Timmy. The company mailed 77,715 rings to viewers.<ref name=\"Col107\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.107</ref> In 1959, the company offered a wallet \"made of rich brown plastic\" emblazoned with a picture of Lassie; 1,343,509 wallets were mailed to viewers who sent in five different labels from Campbell products. The labels represented 6.5 million cans of Campbell's products sold.<ref name=\"Col131\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.131</ref> Campbell's paid the Wrather Company $7 million a year to air its commercials. The soup company's profits rose seventy percent over its pre-''Lassie'' days.<ref name=\"Col138\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.138</ref>\n\nLassie was spokesdog for Recipe Dog Food, a Campbell's product introduced in 1969, which was reportedly based on the homemade stew mixture Weatherwax prepared for Lassie. Printed advertisements for the product announced, \"Now all dogs can come home to the dinner Lassie comes home to.\" In its first year, Recipe earned $10 million for Campbell's, and, in its third year, $40 million. To help boost sales, Campbell's paid Weatherwax to write a dog-training manual called ''The Lassie Method'' which the company used as a premium offer.<ref name=\"Col168\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.168</ref>\n\n==Plot and themes==\n{{further|List of Lassie episodes}}\n[[File:Lassie.jpg|thumb|upright|175px|[[Lassie]]]]\nPlots during the first ten \"boy and his dog\" seasons were similar: the boy (Jeff or Timmy) got into some sort of trouble. Lassie then dashed off to get help or rushed in to save her master's life herself. After being reunited with family and breathing a sigh of relief, the boy received a light lecture on why he should not have done what he had done.<ref name=\"Col121\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.121</ref> In 2004, June Lockhart described the show as \"...a fairy tale about people on a farm in which the dog solves all the problems in 22 minutes, in time for the last commercial.\"<ref name=\"Barron\">Barron</ref>\n\nTwo ''Timmy and Lassie'' episodes launched Campbell's Soup premiums, while two others promoted a [[UNICEF]] Halloween project<ref>{{cite web|url=http://episodes.lassieweb.org/lassie06.htm|title=Lassie season 6|publisher=Lassie Web|accessdate=2014-03-23}}</ref> and the Peace Patrol, a children's [[savings bond]] program spearheaded by ''Lassie'' and ''[[The Lone Ranger]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://episoeds.lassieweb.org/lassie05.htm|title=Lassie season 5|publisher=Lassie Web|accessdate=2014-03-23}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The same seasons saw several [[Christmas]] episodes, while [[conservation ethic|conservation]] and [[environmentalism]] were brought center stage. Some scripts dealt with race and ethnicity with both Jeff and Timmy championing [[Hispanics]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], and [[Asian Americans]]. Aging Americans were presented in a positive light during the years when [[Andy Clyde]] was featured as Martin family friend/neighbor [[Cully Wilson]].\n\nSeasons 11\u201316 were the \"Ranger years\" of the series, as Lassie (due to not being able to travel to Australia with the Martins after Paul had gotten a job offer to teach agriculture there) was taken in by U.S. Forest Ranger [[Corey Stuart]] (who appeared in a few episodes of season 10) and began to work with the [[U.S. Forest Service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://episodes.lassieweb.org/lassie11.htm|title=Lassie season 11|publisher=Lassie Web|accessdate=2014-03-23}}</ref>  [[Color motion picture film|Color filming]] was exploited during the Ranger years with Lassie and her friends sent to exotic locations such as [[Sequoia National Forest]] and [[Monument Valley]], creating miniature [[Travelogue (films)|travelogues]] for viewers.

No explanation was given as to why Lassie was no longer with the Forest Service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://episodes.lassieweb.org/lassie17.htm|title=Lassie season 17|publisher=Lassie Web|accessdate=2014-03-23}}</ref>  Some episodes during this final CBS season were animals-only.\n\nDuring seasons 18 and 19 (with the series having moved to [[first run syndication]]), Lassie was taken in by Garth Holden (played by [[Ron Hayes]]) who was in charge of the Holden Ranch \u2013 a home for orphaned boys \u2013 which he ran with his college-age son and his friend.  This became Lassie's home for the final two years of the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://episodes.lassieweb.org/lassie18.htm|title=Lassie season 18|publisher=Lassie Web|accessdate=2014-03-23}}</ref><ref name=\"Collins\">[[#Collins|Collins]]:</ref>\n\n''Lassie'' themes explored the relationship between boys and their dogs with the show helping to shape the viewer's understanding of mid-twentieth century American [[Childhood|boyhood]]. ''Lassie'' was associated with the wholesome family values of its period but some parents' groups monitoring television content found cliffhanger plots showing children in danger too intense for very young viewers and objected to some of Timmy's actions which were believed to encourage children to disobey parents. However, Lassie was consistently depicted as caring, nurturing, and responsible with a commitment to family and community, often rescuing those in peril and righting wrongs. She was the perfect 'mother' within the American ideology of the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name=\"Jenkins\"/>\n\n==Characters and cast==\n\n===Human leads===\n[[File:Lassie Tommy Rettig Circa 1955.jpg|right|175px|thumb|[[Tommy Rettig]] starred as [[Jeff Miller (Lassie)|Jeff Miller]] during the early years of the series (1954\u20131957), which were syndicated as ''Jeff's Collie'']]\n[[File:Lassie Jon Provost 1961.JPG|right|thumb|175px|[[Jon Provost]] starred as [[Timmy Martin]] during the middle years of the series (1957\u20131964), which were syndicated as ''Timmy & Lassie'']]\n[[File:Lassie with actor Robert Bray.jpg|175px|right|thumb|[[Robert Bray]] starred as Ranger [[Corey Stuart]] during the majority of the Forest Service years of the series from 1964\u20131968]]\n[[File:Lassie 1969.JPG|right|thumb|175px|Jack De Mave (left) and [[Jed Allan]] (right) starred as Rangers Bob Erickson and Scott Turner respectively during the later Forest Service years of the series from 1968\u20131970]]\n[[File:Lassie 1971.JPG|right|thumb|175px|Lassie traveled on her own in the final CBS season (1970\u201371), getting into various adventures before settling in at the Holden Ranch for the final two seasons of the series once it moved to [[first-run syndication]].

In 1971, in order to promote community-related programming among local affiliates, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] moved [[primetime]] Sundays to 8:00 P.M. EST with the institution of the [[Prime Time Access Rule]]. CBS executives felt ''Lassie'' would not be well received in a time slot other than its traditional 7:00&nbsp;p.m. slot, and, with the network's other family programs set, the show was canceled.<ref name=\"Collins\"/> (''Lassie'' was among several shows that CBS canceled during this time period as part of a [[rural purge|change in its target demographics]].) ''Lassie'' then entered first-run syndication with Jack Wrather and Campbell's Soup still on board, and remained on the air for another two years with its final episode airing in March 1973. All totaled, 591 episodes were produced.\n\nThe Miller years were sold into syndication in 1958 under the title of ''Jeff's Collie''.  In rerun syndication, the Martin family episodes aired under the title of ''Timmy & Lassie.'' Re-runs of the series aired on [[Nickelodeon]] from 1984 until 1996.\n\n===Current airings===\n[[Universal Television]], as successor-in-interest to previous franchise owner [[Classic Media]], currently owns the rights to the entire ''Lassie'' television series, as well as the Lassie trademark, with [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]] handling syndication.\n\n[[FETV]] (Family Entertainment Television) airs the show early mornings.<ref>[http://www.fetv.tv/show/lassie Lassie on FETV]</ref>\n\n===Later series===\nWhile the original series had no direct spinoffs, a few subsequent productions would use the Lassie character.\n\nIn 1973, ABC created an animated Saturday-morning [[animation|animated]] program called ''[[Lassie's Rescue Rangers]]'' produced by [[Filmation]].<ref name=\"Collins\"/>\n\nIn 1989, what was essentially a sequel series, ''[[The New Lassie]]'' \u2013 featuring Jon Provost as Steve McCullough \u2013 aired in first-run syndication. In its seventh episode (\"Roots\"), June Lockhart reprised her Ruth Martin role when Steve McCullough is revealed to be the adult Timmy Martin.  It is revealed that Timmy was never properly adopted by the Martins and consequently was forced to remain in the U.S. when Ruth and Paul emigrated to Australia.  Timmy was then subsequently adopted by the McCullough family and began going by his middle name Steven.<ref>[[#Roots|Roots]]:</ref> In 1991, Tommy Rettig made a guest appearance in the episode \"The Amazing Lassie\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0659513/|title=\"The New Lassie\" The Amazing Lassie (1991)|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=9 May 2010}}</ref> This would be his final television appearance prior to his death in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0720568/|title=Tommy Rettig|website=[[IMDb]]|publisher=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, a modified remake \u2013 also called ''[[Lassie (1997 TV series)|Lassie]]'' \u2013 debuted, airing in the U.S. on the then new [[Animal Planet]] cable network.  This show (which was filmed in Canada and set in [[Vermont]]) also revolved around a boy named Timmy and his dog, though differences in setting and character circumstances precluded it from being an exact remake of the original series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118380/locations|title=Filming locations for  \"Lassie\" (1997)|website=IMDb|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Feature film===\nDuring [[Thanksgiving]] week 1962, a five-part color episode called \"The Journey\".<ref name=\"Provost\"/> was filmed in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|High Sierra]].

EST, and often ranked among the top 25 shows on television. The show's highest ranking years in the [[Nielsen ratings]] were the Martin years when the show placed #24 in 1957, #22 in 1958, #15 in 1959, #15 in 1961, #21 in 1962, #13 in 1963, and #17 in 1964. The only Martin year ''Lassie'' did not climb into the top twenty-five was 1960, when it ran opposite ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Walt Disney Presents]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and ''[[The Shirley Temple Show|Shirley Temple Theater]]'' on [[NBC]].<ref name=\"Col166\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.166</ref> However, ''Lassie'' still ran opposite Disney when the [[Disney anthology television series]] moved to NBC in 1961, and still managed to climb into the Top 25. With the advent of the Forest Service seasons, the show began a steady decline in ratings.<ref name=\"Jenkins\" />\n\nFrom 1959 through 1967 (with the exception of 1963), the show was regularly pre-empted by CBS's annual two-hour fall telecast of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', which was always shown on a Sunday from 6:00 to 8:00 P.M. E.S.T. Because the 1939 film always drew such a huge TV audience, CBS's Nielsen ratings in the 7:00 P.M. time slot remained high. ''Lassie'' did not even place in the top 30 once the annual telecast of ''Oz'' was on NBC Sunday opposite the show from 1969 to 1971.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Season !!

The show was the creation of producer [[Robert Maxwell (producer)|Robert Maxwell]] and animal trainer [[Rudd Weatherwax]] and was televised from September 12, 1954, to March 25, 1973. The [[list of longest-running U.S. primetime television series|fifth longest-running U.S. primetime television series]] after ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' and ''[[Law & Order]]'', the show ran for 17 seasons on [[CBS]] before entering [[Television syndication|first-run syndication]] for its final two seasons. Initially filmed in black and white, the show transitioned to color in 1965.\n\nThe show's first 10 seasons follow Lassie's adventures in a fictional small [[farming|farming community]]. Eleven-year-old Jeff Miller, his mother Ellen, and his grandfather are Lassie's first human companions until seven-year-old Timmy Martin and his adoptive parents take over in the fourth season. When Lassie's exploits on the farm end in the eleventh season, she finds new adventures in the wilderness alongside [[United States Forest Service]] Rangers. After traveling on her own for a year, Lassie finally settles at a children's home for her final two syndicated seasons.\n\n''Lassie'' received critical favor at its debut and won two [[Emmy Award]]s in its first years. Stars [[Jan Clayton]] and [[June Lockhart]] were nominated for Emmys. Merchandise produced during the show's run included books, a [[Halloween]] costume, clothing, toys, and other items. [[Campbell's Soup Company|Campbell's Soup]], the show's lifelong sponsor, offered two premiums (a ring and a wallet), and distributed thousands to fans. A multi-part episode was edited into the feature film ''Lassie's Great Adventure'' and released in August 1963. Selected episodes have been released to DVD.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Concept and development===\nBetween 1943 and 1951, fictional collie [[Lassie]] was the inspiration for seven feature films produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].<ref name=\"Jenkins\">[[#Jenkins|Jenkins]]</ref> With completion of the seventh film in 1951, MGM planned no further films for the Lassie character or [[Pal (dog)|Pal]], the male dog actor who portrayed Lassie. In lieu of $40,000 back pay owed him by MGM, Pal's owner and trainer [[Rudd Weatherwax]] was given all rights to the Lassie trademark and name. Weatherwax and Pal, appearing as Lassie, began to perform at county fairs, carnivals,  rodeos, and other venues.<ref name=\"Col76-8\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.76\u20138</ref>\n\nNeeding material for the relatively new medium of television, producer [[Robert Maxwell (producer)|Robert Maxwell]] sold Weatherwax on the concept of a Lassie television series with a boy and his dog theme. The two men developed a scenario about a struggling war widow, her young son, and her father-in-law set on a weather-beaten, modern-day American farm.<ref name=\"Col78-9\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.78\u20139</ref> Two pilots were filmed in [[Calgary, Alberta]], Canada with the first telling the story of the bond forged between boy and dog, and the second filmed to give potential sponsors and network buyers an idea of a typical episode. After viewing the pilots, [[CBS]] put the show on its fall 1954 schedule.<ref name=\"Col81\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.81</ref> [[Campbell's Soup Company]] signed on early as the show's sole sponsor and remained so for the show's entire 19 season  run.<ref name=\"Col83\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.83</ref><ref group=\"note\">As word spread through the Hollywood community about the series, MGM began legal action,  halting production and alleging copyright infringement. The studio claimed it still owned the Lassie trademark and name. Before court action began, Weatherwax was able to produce documentation proving that MGM had given him all rights to Lassie. ([[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.81\u20132)</ref> Filming for the series began in the summer of 1954, and ''Lassie'' made its d\u00e9but Sunday, September 12, 1954, at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]], a time slot the show would call home on CBS for the next seventeen years.<ref name=\"Col82-3\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.82\u20133</ref><ref name=\"Stevens\">[[#Stevens|Stevens]]</ref>\n\nIn 1957, [[Jack Wrather]], owner of the hit television series ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' and ''[[Sergeant Preston of the Yukon]]'' purchased all rights to the ''Lassie'' television show for $3.25 million, and guided the show through its next several seasons.<ref name=\"Col96\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.96</ref>  As 1964 and the show's eleventh season approached, the decision was made to completely rework the show; the boy and his dog theme was dropped and Lassie was teamed with a succession of [[United States Forest Service]] workers. The show focused on [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] and [[environmentalism]], but its relevance in a time of social change was questioned. The show began a steady decline in ratings.<ref name=\"Jenkins\" /><ref name=\"Col150,156\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.150,156</ref> In 1971, [[Prime Time Access Rule|new rulings]] regarding network [[prime time]] scheduling were handed down from the [[Federal Communications Commission]], and CBS canceled the show. ''Lassie'' then entered first-run syndication for two seasons before televising its last new episode on Sunday March 25, 1973.<ref name=\"Col172-3\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.172\u20133</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Jan Clayton and George Cleveland Lassie 1956.JPG|thumb|175px|right|Original series stars [[Jan Clayton]] (as Ellen Miller) and [[George Cleveland]] (as Gramps).

Though he recovered, Lassie Junior never worked the show again.<ref name=\"Col6\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.6</ref> His son Spook was rushed into the series while his brother Baby was in training for the role. Spook was inadequately prepared and never became comfortable on the set after an overhead light crashed to the floor on his first day. Weatherwax, however, coaxed a natural and seemingly confident performance from the nervous dog, and some regard Spook's portrayal as Weatherwax's finest work.<ref name=\"Col128\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.128</ref> Spook played the role in the spring and fall of 1960.<ref name=\"Col6\" /> Baby, son of Lassie Junior and brother to Spook, worked the show for six years. He appeared in the last Timmy years, and two of the Forest Service seasons. Baby died at just eight years of age, the only Lassie not to live at least seventeen years. He was followed in the role by Mire who played Lassie for five years. He portrayed the fictional collie in the syndicated seasons.<ref name=\"Col6-7\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.6\u20137</ref>\n\nBroadway star and quiz show panelist [[Jan Clayton]] was hired to play farm widow [[Ellen Miller (Lassie)|Ellen Miller]] with septuagenarian [[George Cleveland]] playing her father-in-law, George \"Gramps\" Miller.

The three juvenile actors spent a week at Rudd Weatherwax's home in [[North Hollywood, California]] with Pal, and, as Rettig recalled, \"Lassie liked me better than the other two kids. I loved animals, and this seemed to be very important to Rudd.\" Rettig won the role.

Ratings dropped. When filming was completed for the 1957\u201358 season in February 1958, Wrather severed ties with producer Maxwell and dropped Leachman and Shepodd.<ref>[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.105,110</ref> Film veteran [[June Lockhart]] and Broadway stage star [[Hugh Reilly]] replaced Leachman and Sheppod as Ruth and Paul Martin at the top of the fifth season.<ref name=\"Col112,114\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.112,114</ref> Todd Ferrell played Timmy's friend Ralph \"Boomer\" Bates with his dog Mike a recurring character but both were dropped in 1959.<ref name=\"Jenkins\"/><ref name=\"Col119-20\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.119\u201320</ref>\n\nFormer [[Keystone Kop]] [[Andy Clyde]], also a co-star of ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', became a regular in 1959 as neighbor Cully Wilson.<ref name=\"Col129\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.129</ref>\n\nGuest stars during the Timmy years included \"[[Clayton Moore|The Lone Ranger]]\", Baseball player [[Roy Campanella]], Olympian [[Rafer Johnson]],<ref name=\"Col133,143\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.133,143</ref> [[Stacy Keach]], [[Marie Windsor]], [[Dick Foran]], [[Tod Griffin]], [[Jane Darwell]], [[Denver Pyle]], [[Fuzzy Knight]], [[Harry Carey, Jr.]], [[William Schallert]], [[Ellen Corby]], and [[Karl Swenson]].<ref name=\"Pro135\">[[#Provost|Provost]] 2007, p.135</ref>\n\nDuring its first four years, ''Lassie'' received very decent ratings. However, at the end of the 1958\u20131959 season, the ratings had fallen from  the top 30, likely due to the constant turnover in the cast. Once viewers began to warm to Lockhart and Reilly as Timmy's parents, the Martin family was accepted and embraced by the public. As a result, between 1960 and 1964, ''Lassie'''s ratings greatly improved and by the spring of 1964, it received its highest rating ever, ranking at #13.\n[[File:Lassie 1957 cast photo.JPG|thumb|175px|[[Jon Shepodd]] and [[Cloris Leachman]] originally played Paul and Ruth Martin in the final twenty eight episodes of season 4.]]\n[[File:Lassie 1960 cast photo.JPG|thumb|175px|...but were replaced after season 4  by [[Hugh Reilly]] and [[June Lockhart]] respectively.]]\nIn 1964, Provost declined to renew his contract.<ref name=\"Col148\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.148</ref> Producers decided to broaden the show's demographics to appeal to older viewers,<ref name=\"Stevens\" /> and, to that end, dropped the boy and his dog theme for a plot featuring a Forest Service Ranger.<ref name=\"Col150\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.150</ref> [[Robert Bray]], a former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] and [[Gary Cooper]] look-alike was cast as Corey Stuart.<ref name=\"Jenkins\" /> During Bray's first year, the show transitioned to color filming and spectacular scenic locations across America were exploited as settings for the show.<ref name=\"Col156-8\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.156\u20138</ref> Eventually, Bray's long battle with [[alcoholism]] forced him from the show,<ref name=\"Col163\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.163</ref> and Jack De Mave and [[Jed Allan]] were hired to replace him.<ref name=\"Col163-4\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.163\u20134</ref>\n\nGuest stars during the Ranger years included [[Ken Osmond]], [[Paul Petersen]], [[Suzanne Somers]], [[Victor French]], Leo Gordon, and [[Morgan Brittany]].<ref name=\"Col169\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.169</ref>  When the Forest Service years came to an end, Lassie wandered the country on her own for a season then settled at the Holden ranch for her final two syndicated seasons with costars [[Ron Hayes]], [[Larry Pennell]], Skip Burton, [[Larry Wilcox]], [[Sherry Boucher]], and [[Pamelyn Ferdin]].<ref name=\"Jenkins\" /><ref name=\"Col172-3\"/>\n\n====Narration====\nWrather's wife, and series associate producer [[Bonita Granville|Bonita Granville Wrather]] narrated numerous episodes throughout the run of the series, usually the beginning and/or ending of multi-part episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://episodes.lassieweb.org/lassie08.htm|title=Wrather narration|publisher=Lassie Web|accessdate=2014-07-26}}</ref>\n\n===Writers===\nNovelist [[Inez Asher]] was among those who wrote for the series, while other scripts were produced by writers blacklisted during the heyday of [[McCarthyism]] and the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].

The bond translated to film, making the boy and dog scenes more believable, but, eventually the dog developed divided loyalties (looking to Rettig for direction rather than Weatherwax) and the trainer was forced to curtail the amount of time boy and dog spent together.<ref name=\"Col89-91\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.89\u201391</ref>\n\nTypically, there were two dog trainers on the set, each teetering on a stepladder only Lassie could see and waving a chunk of meat at the dog. \"It would look as though Lassie was looking at Jon (Provost), but he was really looking past Jon at the piece of beef\",<ref name=\"Barron\" /> Lockhart recalled in 2004. When Provost delivered his line, the trainer behind Lockhart would whisper \"Lassie!\" and wave another piece of meat. Lassie's head would turn to Lockhart who would deliver her line. Then the trainer behind Provost would get Lassie's attention again, and Provost would deliver his next line. \"The sound editor would cut out all that,\" Lockhart said, \"You finally got to where you never heard the trainers. Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it.\" In addition to the main Lassie, three other Lassies might be involved in an episode shoot: a stand-in for rehearsals, a stunt double, and a \"fighter\" for scenes involving battles with other animals.<ref name=\"Barron\" />\n\n===Theme music===\n''Lassie'' used several pieces of theme music during its long broadcast history. For the first season, \"Secret of the Silent Hills (Theme from the Lassie TV series)\", is used for both the opening and ending theme. Composed by [[William Lava]], the orchestral theme was originally created for the 1940 radio show ''The Courageous Dr. Christian''.<ref name=\"Lassie /Jeffs Collie /Timmy and Lassie\">Lassie /Jeffs Collie /Timmy and Lassie</ref>\n\nFor the second and third season a variation of this theme, titled simply \"Lassie Main & End Title\", was used for the opening and ending theme. [[Raoul Kraushaar]], the music director for the series, is the listed composer for the theme; however the changes he made to the original are so slight that only a trained ear can tell the difference. The third theme used for the series is an orchestral rendition of the [[aria]], \"Dio Possente\" (Even Bravest Hearts May Swell) from [[Charles Gounod]]'s opera, ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''. The exact time this theme started being used is uncertain due to conflicting records; however it is agreed that it was the third series, and was used for at least part of season four for the change of ownership of Lassie.<ref name=\"Lassie /Jeffs Collie /Timmy and Lassie\" />\n\nThe most famous of the Lassie theme songs appeared at the start of the fifth season. Copyrighted as \"Lassie Main & End Title\", the song was created by [[Les Baxter]], with the whistling itself performed by [[Muzzy Marcellino]]. Nicknamed \"The Whistler,\" it remained the series theme for the rest of the \"Martin years\". With the coming of the \"Ranger years\", the opening and ending theme was changed to [[Nathan Scott]]'s arrangement of the traditional folk tune ''[[Greensleeves]]''. An orchestral \"Whistler\" returned for the series theme during the thirteenth season for the seven-part \"Voyager\" episode, and would remain the series theme for the rest of its run.<ref name=\"Lassie /Jeffs Collie /Timmy and Lassie\" /> Television composer [[Nathan Scott (composer)|Nathan Scott]] scored the music to nearly every episode between 1963 and 1973,<ref name=variety>{{cite news|first=Jon|last=Burlingame|title=Nathan Scott, 94, scored TV shows&nbsp;\u2013 Composer's credits included 'Dragnet,' 'Lassie' |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118016005.html?categoryid=25&cs=1 |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=March 3, 2010 |accessdate=March 10, 2010}}</ref> except for four episodes.<ref name=latimes>{{cite news|first=Dennis|last=McClellan|title=Nathan Scott dies at 94; film and TV composer, arranger and conductor |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/04/local/la-me-nathan-scott5-2010mar05 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc|Tribune Publishing]]|date=March 4, 2010 |accessdate=March 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Sponsor===\n[[Campbell's Soup Company]] sponsored the entire nineteen-year run of ''Lassie''. In one of the first instances of [[product placement]], the company asked that their products be visible on the set and so, in episode after episode, Campbell's products are seen in background shots. Campbell's also contractually required the show's stars to avoid appearing in any film or theatrical production that undermined their All-American images.<ref name=\"Col83,85,115,136\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, pp.83,85,115,136</ref>\n\nIn 1956, the company held a \"Name Lassie's Puppies\" contest with the grand prizes being Lassie's pups and $2,000.

The company mailed 77,715 rings to viewers.<ref name=\"Col107\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.107</ref> In 1959, the company offered a wallet \"made of rich brown plastic\" emblazoned with a picture of Lassie; 1,343,509 wallets were mailed to viewers who sent in five different labels from Campbell products. The labels represented 6.5 million cans of Campbell's products sold.<ref name=\"Col131\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.131</ref> Campbell's paid the Wrather Company $7 million a year to air its commercials. The soup company's profits rose seventy percent over its pre-''Lassie'' days.<ref name=\"Col138\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.138</ref>\n\nLassie was spokesdog for Recipe Dog Food, a Campbell's product introduced in 1969, which was reportedly based on the homemade stew mixture Weatherwax prepared for Lassie. Printed advertisements for the product announced, \"Now all dogs can come home to the dinner Lassie comes home to.\" In its first year, Recipe earned $10 million for Campbell's, and, in its third year, $40 million. To help boost sales, Campbell's paid Weatherwax to write a dog-training manual called ''The Lassie Method'' which the company used as a premium offer.<ref name=\"Col168\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.168</ref>\n\n==Plot and themes==\n{{further|List of Lassie episodes}}\n[[File:Lassie.jpg|thumb|upright|175px|[[Lassie]]]]\nPlots during the first ten \"boy and his dog\" seasons were similar: the boy (Jeff or Timmy) got into some sort of trouble. Lassie then dashed off to get help or rushed in to save her master's life herself. After being reunited with family and breathing a sigh of relief, the boy received a light lecture on why he should not have done what he had done.<ref name=\"Col121\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.121</ref> In 2004, June Lockhart described the show as \"...a fairy tale about people on a farm in which the dog solves all the problems in 22 minutes, in time for the last commercial.\"<ref name=\"Barron\">Barron</ref>\n\nTwo ''Timmy and Lassie'' episodes launched Campbell's Soup premiums, while two others promoted a [[UNICEF]] Halloween project<ref>{{cite web|url=http://episodes.lassieweb.org/lassie06.htm|title=Lassie season 6|publisher=Lassie Web|accessdate=2014-03-23}}</ref> and the Peace Patrol, a children's [[savings bond]] program spearheaded by ''Lassie'' and ''[[The Lone Ranger]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://episoeds.lassieweb.org/lassie05.htm|title=Lassie season 5|publisher=Lassie Web|accessdate=2014-03-23}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The same seasons saw several [[Christmas]] episodes, while [[conservation ethic|conservation]] and [[environmentalism]] were brought center stage.

Aging Americans were presented in a positive light during the years when [[Andy Clyde]] was featured as Martin family friend/neighbor [[Cully Wilson]].\n\nSeasons 11\u201316 were the \"Ranger years\" of the series, as Lassie (due to not being able to travel to Australia with the Martins after Paul had gotten a job offer to teach agriculture there) was taken in by U.S. Forest Ranger [[Corey Stuart]] (who appeared in a few episodes of season 10) and began to work with the [[U.S. Forest Service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://episodes.lassieweb.org/lassie11.htm|title=Lassie season 11|publisher=Lassie Web|accessdate=2014-03-23}}</ref>  [[Color motion picture film|Color filming]] was exploited during the Ranger years with Lassie and her friends sent to exotic locations such as [[Sequoia National Forest]] and [[Monument Valley]], creating miniature [[Travelogue (films)|travelogues]] for viewers.

No explanation was given as to why Lassie was no longer with the Forest Service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://episodes.lassieweb.org/lassie17.htm|title=Lassie season 17|publisher=Lassie Web|accessdate=2014-03-23}}</ref>  Some episodes during this final CBS season were animals-only.\n\nDuring seasons 18 and 19 (with the series having moved to [[first run syndication]]), Lassie was taken in by Garth Holden (played by [[Ron Hayes]]) who was in charge of the Holden Ranch \u2013 a home for orphaned boys \u2013 which he ran with his college-age son and his friend.

''Lassie'' was associated with the wholesome family values of its period but some parents' groups monitoring television content found cliffhanger plots showing children in danger too intense for very young viewers and objected to some of Timmy's actions which were believed to encourage children to disobey parents. However, Lassie was consistently depicted as caring, nurturing, and responsible with a commitment to family and community, often rescuing those in peril and righting wrongs. She was the perfect 'mother' within the American ideology of the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name=\"Jenkins\"/>\n\n==Characters and cast==\n\n===Human leads===\n[[File:Lassie Tommy Rettig Circa 1955.jpg|right|175px|thumb|[[Tommy Rettig]] starred as [[Jeff Miller (Lassie)|Jeff Miller]] during the early years of the series (1954\u20131957), which were syndicated as ''Jeff's Collie'']]\n[[File:Lassie Jon Provost 1961.JPG|right|thumb|175px|[[Jon Provost]] starred as [[Timmy Martin]] during the middle years of the series (1957\u20131964), which were syndicated as ''Timmy & Lassie'']]\n[[File:Lassie with actor Robert Bray.jpg|175px|right|thumb|[[Robert Bray]] starred as Ranger [[Corey Stuart]] during the majority of the Forest Service years of the series from 1964\u20131968]]\n[[File:Lassie 1969.JPG|right|thumb|175px|Jack De Mave (left) and [[Jed Allan]] (right) starred as Rangers Bob Erickson and Scott Turner respectively during the later Forest Service years of the series from 1968\u20131970]]\n[[File:Lassie 1971.JPG|right|thumb|175px|Lassie traveled on her own in the final CBS season (1970\u201371), getting into various adventures before settling in at the Holden Ranch for the final two seasons of the series once it moved to [[first-run syndication]].

In 1971, in order to promote community-related programming among local affiliates, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] moved [[primetime]] Sundays to 8:00 P.M. EST with the institution of the [[Prime Time Access Rule]]. CBS executives felt ''Lassie'' would not be well received in a time slot other than its traditional 7:00&nbsp;p.m. slot, and, with the network's other family programs set, the show was canceled.<ref name=\"Collins\"/> (''Lassie'' was among several shows that CBS canceled during this time period as part of a [[rural purge|change in its target demographics]].) ''Lassie'' then entered first-run syndication with Jack Wrather and Campbell's Soup still on board, and remained on the air for another two years with its final episode airing in March 1973. All totaled, 591 episodes were produced.\n\nThe Miller years were sold into syndication in 1958 under the title of ''Jeff's Collie''.  In rerun syndication, the Martin family episodes aired under the title of ''Timmy & Lassie.'' Re-runs of the series aired on [[Nickelodeon]] from 1984 until 1996.\n\n===Current airings===\n[[Universal Television]], as successor-in-interest to previous franchise owner [[Classic Media]], currently owns the rights to the entire ''Lassie'' television series, as well as the Lassie trademark, with [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]] handling syndication.\n\n[[FETV]] (Family Entertainment Television) airs the show early mornings.<ref>[http://www.fetv.tv/show/lassie Lassie on FETV]</ref>\n\n===Later series===\nWhile the original series had no direct spinoffs, a few subsequent productions would use the Lassie character.\n\nIn 1973, ABC created an animated Saturday-morning [[animation|animated]] program called ''[[Lassie's Rescue Rangers]]'' produced by [[Filmation]].<ref name=\"Collins\"/>\n\nIn 1989, what was essentially a sequel series, ''[[The New Lassie]]'' \u2013 featuring Jon Provost as Steve McCullough \u2013 aired in first-run syndication. In its seventh episode (\"Roots\"), June Lockhart reprised her Ruth Martin role when Steve McCullough is revealed to be the adult Timmy Martin.  It is revealed that Timmy was never properly adopted by the Martins and consequently was forced to remain in the U.S. when Ruth and Paul emigrated to Australia.

EST, and often ranked among the top 25 shows on television. The show's highest ranking years in the [[Nielsen ratings]] were the Martin years when the show placed #24 in 1957, #22 in 1958, #15 in 1959, #15 in 1961, #21 in 1962, #13 in 1963, and #17 in 1964. The only Martin year ''Lassie'' did not climb into the top twenty-five was 1960, when it ran opposite ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Walt Disney Presents]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and ''[[The Shirley Temple Show|Shirley Temple Theater]]'' on [[NBC]].<ref name=\"Col166\">[[#Collins|Collins]] 1993, p.166</ref> However, ''Lassie'' still ran opposite Disney when the [[Disney anthology television series]] moved to NBC in 1961, and still managed to climb into the Top 25. With the advent of the Forest Service seasons, the show began a steady decline in ratings.<ref name=\"Jenkins\" />\n\nFrom 1959 through 1967 (with the exception of 1963), the show was regularly pre-empted by CBS's annual two-hour fall telecast of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', which was always shown on a Sunday from 6:00 to 8:00 P.M. E.S.T. Because the 1939 film always drew such a huge TV audience, CBS's Nielsen ratings in the 7:00 P.M. time slot remained high. ''Lassie'' did not even place in the top 30 once the annual telecast of ''Oz'' was on NBC Sunday opposite the show from 1969 to 1971.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Season !!
