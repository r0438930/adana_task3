The program broadcast recorded interviews with people related to [[science fiction]] and fantasy, mostly authors, but also movie and television people, scientists, artists, editors, agents, publishers, critics, fans, translators, and collectors.\n\n== Origin ==\nThe show originated in 1979, emerging from a proposed science fiction class at [[Odessa College]] in [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]], Texas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Odessa, TX|url=https://www.odessa-tx.gov|website=odessa-tx.gov|publisher=City of Odessa, TX|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref> In the fall of that year, David Carson, a media-design specialist at the college, and Keith Johnson, the school's astronomer and planetarium director, offered a science fiction course that failed to attract a sufficient number of students. With the large amount of material already prepared for the class, the pair decided to work on a radio show. Carson came up with a format for the program and took it to Johnson. Wally Jackson, the head of the Communications Department and supervisor of the college radio station, gave the go ahead. Odessa College provided recording facilities and funds for tape and telephone expenses.\n[[File:Daryl Lane Jack Williamson and David Carson interview.jpg|thumb|right|Daryl Lane (left) and David Carson (right) interview Jack Williamson]]\nAs work started on the project two more people were added: Daryl Lane, English professor and chair of the English Department at [[Odessa College]]; and David Crews, a production manager and digital musician from one of the local television stations. Besides functioning as an interviewer and on-air voice, Crews also created the synthesized digital score that served as background music to the show and provided its other-worldly mood.\n\n== On the air ==\nThe first show aired locally in June 1980 and the last, as a nationally syndicated production, on December 31, 1983. For the first few mo, ths the show consisted of thirty-minute presentations which aired Saturdays on KOCV-FM, the college's radio station. Employing selections from author interviews, these shows focused on such staple science fiction themes as time travel or robots, or subgenres like Space Opera or New Wave.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Wave Science Fiction|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/new_wave|website=sf-encyclopedia.com|publisher=SFE Ltd.|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nSoon, however, the interview itself became the show's single concern and the format was converted to a simple question-and-answer pattern. Besides discussing their individual books, authors revealed how they started their careers as science fiction writers and why they were drawn to particular themes. Sometimes the producers traveled to an author's home to tape him or her directly, sometimes they went to science fiction conventions<ref>{{cite journal|title=Denvention II|journal=39th World Science Fiction Convention Program|date=1981|page=112|location=Denver, CO|format=Program Booklet}}</ref> and set up recording equipment in hotel rooms, but more often the interviews were taped during long telephone conversations.\n\n== Personnel changes ==\nKeith Johnson left the show when he took an astronomy position with the [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]]. The show also lost David Crews a few months later when he left for a new job in Austin. However, in the spring of 1981 the show gained its final producer, William D. Vernon, a collector of science fiction paperbacks who was employed as a research chemist with El Paso Products Company in Odessa.\n\n== National syndication and format change ==\nThe show needed promotional backing if it was to reach a larger audience. Through Wally Jackson the producers contacted the Longhorn Radio Network in [[Austin, Texas]], which agreed to syndicate the program. Longhorn required one significant change, however: switching from a thirty-minute show once a week to a five-minute production airing every weekday. Before the syndication process was complete, the show's producers formed a corporation to provide legal security. The corporation was called The Permian Basin Science Fiction Association; it was formed in 1982 and was dissolved in 1987.\n\nThe show went off the air for the fall of 1981 while preparations were made for the new format. The producers also expanded their interview targets to encompass individuals peripheral to science fiction, people who were not authors but were somehow related to science fiction and fantasy. Included among the new class of interviewees were movie critic [[Roger Ebert]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Roger Ebert Website|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/|website=rogerebert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref> Muppet creator [[Jim Henson]];<ref>{{cite web|last1=Henson|first1=Jim|title=Jim Henson Website|url=http://www.henson.com/aboutus.php|website=henson.com|publisher=The Jim Henson Company|accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref> agent Richard Curtis;<ref>{{cite web|last1=Curtis|first1=Richard|title=Richard Curtis Article|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0193485/|website=IMDb.com|publisher=IMDb.com, Inc.|accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref> Underwood Miller<ref>{{cite web|title=Underwood-Miller Inc|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/underwood-miller_inc|website=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref> publishers Chuck Miller and Tim Underwood; award-winning science fiction and fantasy artist [[Michael Whelan]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Michael Whelan|url=http://www.michaelwhelan.com/about/|website=michaelwhelan.com|publisher=Michael R.

For newcomers, it provided an introduction to a vital literature of their time. For hardcore fans, it supplied insights and background to what they were reading in books and magazines or seeing on the screen. The show's interviewees also spanned the history of modern science fiction, from authors who began publishing pulp stories<ref>{{cite web|title=Pulp Stories|url=http://bestsciencefictionbooks.com/pulp-science-fiction.php|website=bestsciencefictionbooks.com|publisher=BestScienceFictionBooks.com|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref> in the 1920s to fans in the 1980s attempting to publish their first stories.

Science fiction also expands readers\u2019 minds by exploring scenarios of future warfare, environmental decay, and cosmic catastrophes.\n\nThe show's three-year tenure was also an exciting and fertile time for the genre of science fiction (and fantasy). The best of Golden Age science fiction<ref>{{cite web|title=Golden Age Science Fiction|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/golden_age_of_sf|website=sf-encyclopedia.com|publisher=SFE Ltd.|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref> from the 1940s and 1950s, the best of New Wave science fiction of the 1960s, and the influx of excellent women writers into the field, all combined to produce some of the most remarkable science fiction in the history of the genre.

A typical interview lasted between one and two hours. By the end of its run in December 1983 the interviews extended over 255 large reel-to-reel tapes. Members of the final radio show team (Carson, Vernon, and Lane) were well aware of the value of this archive and sought a way to both preserve it and make the information available to researchers. In 1995 they donated the entire archive (which also included 191 cassette tapes) to the Science Fiction Oral History Association,<ref>{{cite web|title=Science Fiction Oral History Association|url=http://www.sfoha.org/|website=sfoha.org|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref> headed by Lloyd Biggle Jr, in Ypsilanti, Michigan. It was understood that the organization would digitize the tapes and distribute copies among public research institutions.\n\nAt the time of Biggle's death in 2002 very few of the tapes and been digitized and given to research facilities. A handful have shown up at the Vincent Voice Library<ref>{{cite web|title=Vincent Voice Library|url=http://vvl.lib.msu.edu/|website=msu.edu|publisher=Michigan State University Board of Trustees|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref> at the University of Michigan in East Lansing, Michigan, but the great majority of the tapes remain undigitized and unavailable. Their location and stewardship is uncertain. The Science Fiction Oral History Association presumably has custody of the tapes, but the organization has not been active for a number of years.\n\nLane and Carson retired from Odessa College and continue to pursue interests in Odessa.

Though ''The Science Fiction Radio Show'' went off the air in 1983, both Vernon and Carson were invited as guests to the New Orleans Science Fiction Fantasy Festival in June 1989 where they participated in various panel discussions.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Orleans Science Fiction & Fantasy Festival II|url=http://fancyclopedia.org/new-orleans-science-fiction-fantasy-festival|website=fancyclopedia.org|accessdate=24 October 2014|location=Bayou Plaza Hotel, New Orleans, LA|format=Program booklet|date=June 23, 1989}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nDuring its three-year tenure the producers of the radio show interviewed over eighty individuals, the great majority of them authors. A typical interview lasted between one and two hours. By the end of its run in December 1983 the interviews extended over 255 large reel-to-reel tapes. Members of the final radio show team (Carson, Vernon, and Lane) were well aware of the value of this archive and sought a way to both preserve it and make the information available to researchers. In 1995 they donated the entire archive (which also included 191 cassette tapes) to the Science Fiction Oral History Association,<ref>{{cite web|title=Science Fiction Oral History Association|url=http://www.sfoha.org/|website=sfoha.org|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref> headed by Lloyd Biggle Jr, in Ypsilanti, Michigan. It was understood that the organization would digitize the tapes and distribute copies among public research institutions.\n\nAt the time of Biggle's death in 2002 very few of the tapes and been digitized and given to research facilities. A handful have shown up at the Vincent Voice Library<ref>{{cite web|title=Vincent Voice Library|url=http://vvl.lib.msu.edu/|website=msu.edu|publisher=Michigan State University Board of Trustees|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref> at the University of Michigan in East Lansing, Michigan, but the great majority of the tapes remain undigitized and unavailable. Their location and stewardship is uncertain. The Science Fiction Oral History Association presumably has custody of the tapes, but the organization has not been active for a number of years.\n\nLane and Carson retired from Odessa College and continue to pursue interests in Odessa. Vernon now lives in New Orleans and still collects, specializing in the works of [[Philip K. Dick]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Philip K.
