The report cleared Mashal of all blasphemy charges and termed his lynching a premeditated murder conducted by certain elements in the student body and the university administration. The report also cleared Mashal's two friends, Abdullah and Zubair, of any blasphemy while raising questions about the efficacy of Mardan Police's response to the incident.<ref name=\"trib\">{{cite web|last1=Firdous|first1=Iftikhar|title=Plot to 'get rid of' Mashal Khan was hatched a month before murder, concludes JIT|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1427069/plot-get-rid-mashal-khan-hatched-month-murder-concludes-jit/|website=The Express Tribune|date=4 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"ptoday\">{{cite web|title=JIT finds a student group incited mob against Mashal|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/06/04/jit-finds-a-student-group-incited-mob-against-mashal/|website=Pakistan Today}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Akbar|first1=Ali|title=Mashal murder case: JIT finds group in university incited mob against student on pretext of blasphemy|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1337373/mashal-murder-case-jit-finds-group-in-university-incited-mob-against-student-on-pretext-of-blasphemy|website=Dawn.com|date=4 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the report, the two prime inciters of the lynching were Sabir Mayer, president of the [[Pukhtoon Students Federation]], and Ajmal Khan, president of the university's employee union. Ajmal confessed that a month before the lynching, Sabir, along with a university employee, Asad Katlang, came to his office and told him that they had to \"get rid of Mashal\" as he was a \"threat to the party\" (the 'party' is presumed to be the leftist political party, [[Awami National Party]], whose student federation Sabir headed). The trio then proceeded to hatch a plan for Mashal's murder.<ref name=\"trib\" />\n\nAs stated in the report, the prime reason for Mashal's lynching was his constant criticism of the university's administration. A month before his lynching, he gave a television interview to [[AVT Khyber]], a regional news channel, in which he alleged that illegal and criminal activities persisted in the university hostel and female students were also exploited in the university.<ref name=\"ptoday\" />\n\nIt was further found that the university had serious management issues where top posts were filled by people of criminal background due to their political affiliation. It has been suggested in the report that strict departmental action should be taken against registrar Sher Alam, director administration Peer Asfandyar, chief security officer Inayatullah Afridi, provost Fayaz Ali Shah, chief proctor professor Idrees, director sports professor Farooq and assistant registrar Humyaun for their incompetence.<ref name=\"trib\" />\n\nIn its conclusion, the report, which will be submitted to the Supreme Court and the anti-terrorism court (ATC), has suggested severe punishments for the university employees and students involved in the crime.<ref name=\"trib\" />\n\n===Anti-Terrorism Court proceedings===\nOn 7 February 2018, Anti-Terrorism court awarded death penalty to prime suspect Imran Ali.
