POWERGRID transmits about 50% of the total power generated in India on its transmission network. Its former subsidiary company, [[Power System Operation Corporation|Power System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO)]] handles power management for National Grid and all state transmission utilities. POWERGRID also operates a telecom business under the name POWERTEL. Shri Kandikuppa Sreekant serves as the Chairman and Managing Director of the company.\n\n==Origin==\n'''Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID)''' was incorporated on 23 October 1989 under the Companies Act, 1956 with an authorized share capital of Rs. 5,000 Crore (subsequently enhanced to Rs. 10,000 Crore in Financial Year (FY) 2007-08) as a public limited company, wholly owned by the Government of India.\n\nIts original name was the 'National Power Transmission Corporation Limited', and it was charged with planning, executing, owning, operating and maintaining high-voltage transmission systems in the country. On 8 November 1990, the National Power Transmission Corporation received its Certificate for Commencement of Business. Their name was subsequently changed to Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, which took effect on 23 October 1992.\n\nPOWERGRID started functioning on management basis with effect from August, 1991 and subsequently it took over transmission assets from NTPC, NHPC, NEEPCO, NLC, NPC, THDC, SJVNL etc. in a phased manner and it commenced commercial operation in 1992\u201393. In addition to this, it also took over the operation of existing Regional Load Despatch Centers (RLDCs) from Central Electricity Authority (CEA), in a phased manner from 1994 to 1996, which have been upgraded and modernized with State of-the-art Unified Load Despatch and Communication (ULDC) schemes. Consequently, National Load Despatch Centre (NLDC) was established in 2009 for overall coordination at National level.\n\nAccording to its mandate, the Corporation, apart from providing transmission system for evacuation of central sector power, is also responsible for Establishment and Operation of Regional and National Power Grids to facilitate transfer of power within and across the Regions with Reliability, Security and Economy on sound commercial principles. Based on its performance POWERGRID was recognized as a Mini-ratna category-I Public Sector Undertaking in October 1998. It is conferred with the status of \"Navratna\" by the Government of India in May 2008 and \"Maharatna\" status in October 2019. POWERGRID, as the Central Transmission Utility of the country, is playing a major role in Indian Power Sector and is also providing Open Access on its inter-State transmission system.\n\n==Business==\n\nPOWERGRID operates throughout India. Its transmission network consists of roughly 1,53,635 circuit kilometers and 243 EHVAC and [[HVDC]] substations, which provide total transformation capacity of 3,67,097 [[Volt ampere|MVA]]. POWERGRID's interregional capacity is 75,050 [[Megawatt|MW]]. Examples of POWERGRID-owned stations include the [[Vizag back-to-back HVDC converter station]], the [[Chandrapur back-to-back HVDC converter station]], the [[India Sri Lanka HVDC Interconnection]], and the [[Talcher\u2013Kolar HVDC system]].\n\nPOWERGRID is listed on both the [[Bombay Stock Exchange|BSE]] and the [[National Stock Exchange of India|NSE]]. As of 30 September 2010, there were 792,096 equity shareholders holders in POWERGRID. Initially, POWERGRID managed transmission assets owned by [[NTPC Limited|NTPC]], [[NHPC]] Limited (\"NHPC\") and [[NEEPCO]] Limited. In January 1993, the Power Transmission Systems Act transferred ownership of the three power companies to POWERGRID. All employees of the three companies subsequently became POWERGRID employees.\n\n===POWERTEL===\nPOWERGRID's telecom company, POWERTEL, operates a network of 47,735 Kilometers and points of presence in 688 locations across India.\n\n==Transmission network failures==\n{{main|2012 India blackouts}}\n\nAbout 2:35 a.m on 30 July 2012, the Northern Region Grid, which provides power to nine states in northern India including [[Delhi]], experienced a widespread outage due to a grid disturbance. POWERGRID and POSOCO began work immediately to restore power. By 8:00&nbsp;a.m. essential services had been restored, with 60 percent of the normal Northern Region Grid load restored by 11:00&nbsp;a.m. Power supply was then restored progressively and by 12:30&nbsp;p.m. power was extended to most of the cities and towns through POWERGRID substations. The Northern Region Grid was brought back to normalcy to meet the demand of about 30 GW at 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\nOn 31 July 2012, the Northern Region Grid collapsed a second time, hours after the power supply had been restored to the northern region following the previous day's disruption. Eastern transmission lines also failed, disrupting power supply in [[Delhi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Haryana]], [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]] and [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], among other states.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3707135.ece|title=Powerless again: Northern, eastern grids fail| date= 31 July 2012}}</ref>\nAfter the power failures, then-Power Minister [[Veerappa Moily]] said that transmission grids would be independently audited in three months to ensure that the grids were fail-safe.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.indianexpress.com/news/independent-audit-of-grids-in-3-months/984704/|title= 'Independent audit of grids in 3 months'| date= 7 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[India Sri Lanka HVDC Interconnection]]\n* [[Talcher\u2013Kolar HVDC system]]\n* [[Chandrapur back-to-back HVDC converter station]]\n* [[Vizag back-to-back HVDC converter station]]\n* [[The Electricity Act, 2003]]\n* [[Electricity sector in India]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.powergridindia.com/ Power Grid Corporate Web-Site]\n* [http://www.srpc.kar.nic.in/html/grid_map.html Grid maps of southern region]\n\n{{Indian PSU}}\n{{S&P CNX Nifty companies}}\n{{Public Sector Undertakings in India}}\n\n[[Category:Electric power transmission system operators in India]]\n[[Category:Converter stations]]\n[[Category:Electric power transmission infrastructure in India]]\n[[Category:Ministry of Power (India)]]\n[[Category:Government-owned companies of India]]\n[[Category:Companies based in New Delhi]]\n[[Category:Energy companies established in 1992]]\n[[Category:Indian companies established in 1992]]\n[[Category:CNX Nifty]]\n[[Category:1992 establishments in India]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=June 2016}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2013}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name = '''Power Grid Corporation of India Limited'''\n| logo = [[File:PowerGrid Corporation of India logo.svg|150px|Power Grid Logo]]\n| type = [[Government-owned corporation]]\n| traded_as = {{NSE|POWERGRID}}<br />{{BSE|532898}}\n| industry = [[Electric utility]]\n| foundation = {{start date|1989|10|23|df=y}}\n| location_city = [[Gurgaon]], [[Haryana]], [[India]]\n| area_served = [[India]]\n| key_people = Kandikuppa Sreekant <br>{{small|(Chairman & MD)}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/kandikuppa-sreekant-becomes-power-grid-cmd/article28833392.ece/amp/|title=kandikuppa-sreekant-becomes-power-grid-cmd|work=thehindubusinessline|access-date=8 August 2019}}</ref>\n| products = [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] and [[Electricity distribution|distribution]]; [[Commodity market|energy trading]]\n| revenue = {{increase}}{{INRConvert|304.30|b}}<small>(2017\u201318)</small><ref name=\"Powergrid\">{{cite web | url=http://www.powergridindia.com/sites/default/files/NSE_AFR_dt290592018.pdf | title=Audited Annual Financial Results of the Company for the Financial Year 2017-18 | date=29 May 2018 | publisher=Power Grid Corporation of India | accessdate=18 May 2018 }}</ref>\n| net_income = {{increase}}{{INRConvert|82.11|b}}<small>(2017\u201318)</small><ref name=\"Powergrid\" />\n| assets = {{increase}}{{INRConvert|2143.26|b}}<small>(2018)</small><ref name=\"Powergrid\" />\n| equity = {{increase}}{{INRConvert|544.26|b}}<small>(2018)</small>\n| num_employees = 8,900 (2018)\n| homepage = [http://www.powergridindia.com/ powergridindia.com]\n}}\n\nThe '''Power Grid Corporation of India Limited''' ('''POWERGRID'''), ({{NSE|POWERGRID}}, {{BSE|532898}}) is an Indian state-owned Maharatna company headquartered in [[Gurgaon|Gurugram, India]] and engaged mainly in Transmission of Power.
