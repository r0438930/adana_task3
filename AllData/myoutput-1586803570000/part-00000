It is a [[remake]] of the 1998 [[Japanese horror]] film ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]'', based on [[Ring (Suzuki novel)|the novel of the same name]] by [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|Koji Suzuki]]. Watts portrays a journalist who investigates a cursed videotape that seemingly kills the viewer seven days after watching it.\n\n''The Ring'' was released theatrically on October 18, 2002, and received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the atmosphere and Watts's performance. The film grossed over $249 million worldwide on a $48 million production budget, making it one of the highest-grossing horror remakes. It is the first installment of the [[The Ring (franchise)#American films|American ''Ring'' series]], and is followed by ''[[The Ring Two]]'' and ''[[Rings (2017 film)|Rings]]'', which were released in 2005 and 2017, respectively.\n\n''The Ring'' paved the way for English-language remakes of Asian horror films, such as ''[[The Grudge (2004 film)|The Grudge]]'', ''[[Dark Water (2005 film)|Dark Water]]'', ''[[Pulse (2006 film)|Pulse]]'', ''[[One Missed Call (2008 film)|One Missed Call]]'', ''[[The Eye (2008 film)|The Eye]]'', ''[[Shutter (2008 film)|Shutter]]'', ''[[Mirrors (2008 film)|Mirrors]]'', ''[[The Echo (2008 film)|The Echo]]'' and ''[[The Uninvited (2009 film)|The Uninvited]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Seattle]], teenagers Katie Embry and Becca Kotler discuss the legend of a cursed videotape; whoever watches it dies seven days later. Katie claims she watched the tape with three friends a week ago. Minutes later, Katie is killed by an unseen force, and Becca is institutionalized after witnessing it.\n\nAt Katie's funeral, her mother, Ruth, urges her sister Rachel Keller, a journalist, to investigate her daughter's death. Rachel lives with her young son Aidan, who possesses a degree of [[mediumship]]. Rachel learns Katie's friends all died on the same night, sporting disfigured appearances. Rachel travels to Shelter Mountain Inn where Katie stayed, discovering the rumoured cursed videotape. Renting the same cabin as Katie, Rachel watches the tape, which contains disturbing, gruesome imagery. Once the tape ends, Rachel receives a phone call from an unknown caller who whispers \u201cseven days\u201d.\n\nRachel recruits Noah Clay, her ex-boyfriend and Aidan's father, to study the tape, making a copy after he watches the original. Rachel begins to suffer supernatural symptoms as the week passes, haunted by a young girl with soaking wet hair. Investigation into the tape's imagery leads Rachel to Anna Morgan, a [[horse breeding|horse breeder]] from Moesko Island, who committed suicide after her prize-winning horses drowned themselves. Rachel catches Aidan watching the tape, and discovers Noah is suffering similar symptoms.\n\nLeaving Aidan in Ruth's care, Rachel travels to Moesko Island to speak to Anna's widower Richard. On the ferry journey, a horse is spooked by Rachel's presence, leaping to its death. Noah goes to Eola Psychiatric Hospital to view Anna's medical files. Both separately discover Anna had an adopted daughter, [[Sadako Yamamura|Samara]], who possessed an ability to [[thoughtography|psychically etch mental images]] onto surfaces and into minds, driving her parents mad. Rachel tries to speak with Richard about Samara, but he denies her existence.\n\nRachel speaks with Dr. Grasnik, the island's GP, who explains Samara was adopted due to Anna's [[infertility]], recommending them to admit her to Eola, assuming Samara is still there. Rachel sneaks into the Morgan farmhouse, watching a videotape of Samara in a psychotherapy session, who claims she has no control over her abilities. Rachel confronts Richard, who electrocutes himself in a bathtub with a [[bridle|horse bridle]] upon learning Samara's powers are still at large. Noah arrives, he and Rachel go to the barn, where Samara was isolated in the loft. They find a burnt image of a tree, Rachel recognizing it from Shelter Mountain.\n\nThey return to the cabin, locating a stone [[water well|well]] hidden under the floorboards; the final image on the tape. Rachel falls in the well, experiencing a vision of Anna suffocating Samara and throwing her down the well, sealing her in, where she drowned seven days later. Samara's corpse surfaces after Noah tells Rachel that the seven day deadline has passed.\n\nThe next day, Aidan tells Rachel that it was a mistake to help Samara, revealing he is still cursed. In his apartment, Noah encounters the [[vengeful ghost]] of Samara emerge from his television, murdering him. Rachel, upon finding his disfigured corpse, returns home and destroys the original tape in a furious rage, asking why Noah was killed but she was not. She realizes that the difference is that she made a copy of the tape, which Aidan watched, thereby continuing the cycle that Samara wants to spread of duplicating the video and showing it to someone else to save oneself.\n\nRachel shows Aidan how to make his own copy. He remarks that the curse will never stop and asks what will happen to the person who watches the new tape, to which Rachel does not answer.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Naomi Watts]] as [[Rachel Keller]]\n*[[David Dorfman]] as Aidan Keller\n*[[Martin Henderson]] as Noah Clay\n*[[Daveigh Chase]] as [[Samara Morgan]]\n*[[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Richard Morgan\n*[[Shannon Cochran]] as Anna Morgan\n*[[Jane Alexander]] as Dr. Grasnik\n*[[Lindsay Frost]] as Ruth Embry\n*[[Amber Tamblyn]] as Katherine \"Katie\" Embry\n*[[Rachael Bella]] as Rebecca \"Becca\" Kotler\n*[[Richard Lineback]] as Innkeeper\n*[[Pauley Perrette]] as Beth\n*[[Sara Rue]] as Babysitter\n*[[Sasha Barrese]] as Girl Teen #1\n*Tess Hall as Girl Teen #2\n*[[Adam Brody]] as Kellen (Male Teen)\n*[[Michael Spound]] as Dave Embry\n*[[Chris Cooper]] as a child murderer (uncredited)\n*[[Joe Chrest]] as Dr. Scott (uncredited)\n*[[Maury Ginsberg]] as a video store clerk (DVD deleted scenes) (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''The Ring'' went into production without a completed script.<ref name=iwgv>{{cite web|url=http://www.curseofthering.com/gore.php|title=Interview with Gore Verbinski|date=2002|publisher=curseofthering.com|accessdate=March 2, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302113145/http://www.curseofthering.com/gore.php|archivedate=March 2, 2017}}</ref> [[Ehren Kruger]] wrote three drafts of the screenplay before [[Scott Frank]] came on to do an uncredited rewrite. Verbinski was initially inspired to do a remake of ''Ringu'' after [[Walter F. Parkes]] sent him a VHS copy of the original Japanese film, which he describes as \"intriguing\", \"Pulp\" and \"avant-garde\".\n\nProducer [[Neal Edelstein]] offered the remake to David Lynch to direct, but he turned it down. The original WGA-approved credits listed Hiroshi Takahashi (writer of the original 1998 screenplay for ''[[Ring (1998 film)|Ring]]'') but his name is absent from the final print.\n\nThe film also sought to retain the minimalism that was prevalent throughout ''Ringu'' and was decidedly set in [[Seattle]], due to its \"wet and isolated\" atmosphere. Verbinski also admitted to not wanting to cast \"big stars\" as he wanted his film to be \"discovered\" and describes the wave of harsh criticism from hardcore fans of the original Japanese film as \"inevitable\" although he expressed desire for hardcore fans of the original to find the remake as equally compelling.<ref name=iwgv/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n[[File:Theringtheme.ogg|thumb|right|The main theme of the film from the track ''The Well'', which is also known as \"Samara's Song\".]]\nThe film features an original score composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] (who would later collaborate on Gore Verbinski's other works). The soundtrack release did not coincide with the film's theatrical run. It was released in 2005, accompanying ''[[The Ring Two]]'' in an album that combined music from both ''The Ring'' and ''The Ring Two''.

He remarks that the curse will never stop and asks what will happen to the person who watches the new tape, to which Rachel does not answer.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Naomi Watts]] as [[Rachel Keller]]\n*[[David Dorfman]] as Aidan Keller\n*[[Martin Henderson]] as Noah Clay\n*[[Daveigh Chase]] as [[Samara Morgan]]\n*[[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Richard Morgan\n*[[Shannon Cochran]] as Anna Morgan\n*[[Jane Alexander]] as Dr. Grasnik\n*[[Lindsay Frost]] as Ruth Embry\n*[[Amber Tamblyn]] as Katherine \"Katie\" Embry\n*[[Rachael Bella]] as Rebecca \"Becca\" Kotler\n*[[Richard Lineback]] as Innkeeper\n*[[Pauley Perrette]] as Beth\n*[[Sara Rue]] as Babysitter\n*[[Sasha Barrese]] as Girl Teen #1\n*Tess Hall as Girl Teen #2\n*[[Adam Brody]] as Kellen (Male Teen)\n*[[Michael Spound]] as Dave Embry\n*[[Chris Cooper]] as a child murderer (uncredited)\n*[[Joe Chrest]] as Dr. Scott (uncredited)\n*[[Maury Ginsberg]] as a video store clerk (DVD deleted scenes) (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''The Ring'' went into production without a completed script.<ref name=iwgv>{{cite web|url=http://www.curseofthering.com/gore.php|title=Interview with Gore Verbinski|date=2002|publisher=curseofthering.com|accessdate=March 2, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302113145/http://www.curseofthering.com/gore.php|archivedate=March 2, 2017}}</ref> [[Ehren Kruger]] wrote three drafts of the screenplay before [[Scott Frank]] came on to do an uncredited rewrite. Verbinski was initially inspired to do a remake of ''Ringu'' after [[Walter F. Parkes]] sent him a VHS copy of the original Japanese film, which he describes as \"intriguing\", \"Pulp\" and \"avant-garde\".\n\nProducer [[Neal Edelstein]] offered the remake to David Lynch to direct, but he turned it down. The original WGA-approved credits listed Hiroshi Takahashi (writer of the original 1998 screenplay for ''[[Ring (1998 film)|Ring]]'') but his name is absent from the final print.\n\nThe film also sought to retain the minimalism that was prevalent throughout ''Ringu'' and was decidedly set in [[Seattle]], due to its \"wet and isolated\" atmosphere. Verbinski also admitted to not wanting to cast \"big stars\" as he wanted his film to be \"discovered\" and describes the wave of harsh criticism from hardcore fans of the original Japanese film as \"inevitable\" although he expressed desire for hardcore fans of the original to find the remake as equally compelling.<ref name=iwgv/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n[[File:Theringtheme.ogg|thumb|right|The main theme of the film from the track ''The Well'', which is also known as \"Samara's Song\".]]\nThe film features an original score composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] (who would later collaborate on Gore Verbinski's other works). The soundtrack release did not coincide with the film's theatrical run. It was released in 2005, accompanying ''[[The Ring Two]]'' in an album that combined music from both ''The Ring'' and ''The Ring Two''.
