Celebrating Akatsuka's eightieth birthday, the series follows the sextuplet Matsuno brothers from the original series as adults, and features more adult-oriented humor compared to the original series. The series aired in Japan between October 2015 and March 2016, with a special episode airing in December 2016. A second season aired between October 2017 and March 2018. Both seasons have been licensed in [[Americas]] by [[Viz Media]]. A [[manga]] adaptation by Masako Shitaro began serialization in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[You (manga magazine)|You]]'' magazine from January 2016. A theatrical anime film premiered on March 15, 2019. The brothers are completely H O M O S E X U A L. If the show was made by a more brave company they would probably be openly H O M O.\n\n==Premise==\nThe original ''Osomatsu-kun'' series followed the Matsuno brothers; Osomatsu, Karamatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, Jushimatsu, and Todomatsu, who are all identical sextuplets who cause mischief. ''Mr. Osomatsu'' depicts the brothers as being ten years older than their original counterparts (with the action taking place in a contemporary setting). All of the brothers have now grown up into lazy [[NEET]]s, with each brother having developed their own distinguishing personality. The series follows the brothers in their everyday (and occasionally made up) lives.\n\n==Characters==\n{{see also|Osomatsu-kun#Characters|l1=Characters in Osomatsu-kun}}\n===Matsuno siblings===\n\n[[File:Osomatsu Matsuno siblings.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Matsuno siblings as depicted in Mr. Osomatsu.

Celebrating Akatsuka's eightieth birthday, the series follows the sextuplet Matsuno brothers from the original series as adults, and features more adult-oriented humor compared to the original series. The series aired in Japan between October 2015 and March 2016, with a special episode airing in December 2016. A second season aired between October 2017 and March 2018. Both seasons have been licensed in [[Americas]] by [[Viz Media]]. A [[manga]] adaptation by Masako Shitaro began serialization in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[You (manga magazine)|You]]'' magazine from January 2016. A theatrical anime film premiered on March 15, 2019. \n\n==Premise==\nThe original ''Osomatsu-kun'' series followed the Matsuno brothers; Osomatsu, Karamatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, Jushimatsu, and Todomatsu, who are all identical sextuplets who cause mischief. ''Mr. Osomatsu'' depicts the brothers as being ten years older than their original counterparts (with the action taking place in a contemporary setting). All of the brothers have now grown up into lazy [[NEET]]s, with each brother having developed their own distinguishing personality. The series follows the brothers in their everyday (and occasionally made up) lives.\n\n==Characters==\n{{see also|Osomatsu-kun#Characters|l1=Characters in Osomatsu-kun}}\n===Matsuno siblings===\n\n[[File:Osomatsu Matsuno siblings.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Matsuno siblings as depicted in Mr. Osomatsu.
