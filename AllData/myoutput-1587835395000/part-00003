Bush''', '''Bush Senior''', or '''Bush 41''' to distinguish him from his eldest son, [[George W. Bush]], who served as the 43rd president from 2001 to 2009; previously he was usually referred to simply as George Bush.</ref> (June 12, 1924{{spaced ndash}}November 30, 2018) was an American politician and businessman who served as the 41st [[president of the United States]] from 1989 to 1993. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Bush also served in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], as [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]], as [[Director of Central Intelligence]], and as the 43rd [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].\n\nBush was raised in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]] and attended [[Phillips Academy]] before serving in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. After the war, he graduated from [[Yale University]] and moved to [[West Texas]], where he established a successful oil company. After an unsuccessful run for the [[United States Senate]], he won election to the [[Texas's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district of Texas]] in 1966. President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Bush to the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]] in 1971 and to the position of [[Chairman of the Republican National Committee|chairman]] of the [[Republican National Committee]] in 1973. In 1974, President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed him as the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to China#List of Chiefs of the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing|Chief of the Liaison Office to the People's Republic of China]], and in 1976 Bush became the [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. Bush ran for president in 1980, but was defeated in the [[1980 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican presidential primaries]] by [[Ronald Reagan]]. He was then elected vice president in 1980 and 1984 as Reagan's running mate.\n\nIn the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential election]], Bush defeated Democrat [[Michael Dukakis]], becoming the first incumbent vice president to be elected president in 152 years. Foreign policy drove the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|Bush presidency]], as he navigated the final years of the [[Cold War]] and played a key role in the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]. Bush presided over the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]] and the [[Gulf War]], ending the [[Iraq]]i occupation of [[Kuwait]] in the latter conflict. Though the agreement was not ratified until after he left office, Bush negotiated and signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which created a trade bloc consisting of the United States, [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]]. Domestically, Bush reneged on [[Read my lips: no new taxes|a 1988 campaign promise]] by signing a bill that increased taxes and helped reduce the federal budget deficit. He also signed the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] and appointed [[David Souter]] and [[Clarence Thomas]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Bush lost the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]] to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] following an [[Early 1990s recession|economic recession]] and the decreased emphasis of foreign policy in a post\u2013Cold War political climate.\n\nAfter leaving office in 1993, Bush was active in humanitarian activities, often working alongside Clinton, his former opponent. With George W. Bush's victory in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], Bush and his son became the second father\u2013son pair to serve as the nation's president, following [[John Adams]] and [[John Quincy Adams]]. Another son, [[Jeb Bush]], unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 Republican primaries]]. After a long battle with vascular [[Parkinson's disease]], Bush died at his home on November 30, 2018.

W. Bush series}}\n\n'''George Herbert Walker Bush'''<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">Since around 2000 he has usually been called '''George H. W. Bush''', '''Bush Senior''', or '''Bush 41''' to distinguish him from his eldest son, [[George W. Bush]], who served as the 43rd president from 2001 to 2009; previously he was usually referred to simply as George Bush.</ref> (June 12, 1924{{spaced ndash}}November 30, 2018) was an American politician and businessman who served as the 41st [[president of the United States]] from 1989 to 1993. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Bush also served in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], as [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]], as [[Director of Central Intelligence]], and as the 43rd [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].\n\nBush was raised in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]] and attended [[Phillips Academy]] before serving in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. After the war, he graduated from [[Yale University]] and moved to [[West Texas]], where he established a successful oil company. After an unsuccessful run for the [[United States Senate]], he won election to the [[Texas's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district of Texas]] in 1966. President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Bush to the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]] in 1971 and to the position of [[Chairman of the Republican National Committee|chairman]] of the [[Republican National Committee]] in 1973. In 1974, President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed him as the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to China#List of Chiefs of the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing|Chief of the Liaison Office to the People's Republic of China]], and in 1976 Bush became the [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. Bush ran for president in 1980, but was defeated in the [[1980 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican presidential primaries]] by [[Ronald Reagan]]. He was then elected vice president in 1980 and 1984 as Reagan's running mate.\n\nIn the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential election]], Bush defeated Democrat [[Michael Dukakis]], becoming the first incumbent vice president to be elected president in 152 years. Foreign policy drove the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|Bush presidency]], as he navigated the final years of the [[Cold War]] and played a key role in the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]. Bush presided over the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]] and the [[Gulf War]], ending the [[Iraq]]i occupation of [[Kuwait]] in the latter conflict. Though the agreement was not ratified until after he left office, Bush negotiated and signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which created a trade bloc consisting of the United States, [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]]. Domestically, Bush reneged on [[Read my lips: no new taxes|a 1988 campaign promise]] by signing a bill that increased taxes and helped reduce the federal budget deficit. He also signed the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] and appointed [[David Souter]] and [[Clarence Thomas]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Bush lost the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]] to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] following an [[Early 1990s recession|economic recession]] and the decreased emphasis of foreign policy in a post\u2013Cold War political climate.\n\nAfter leaving office in 1993, Bush was active in humanitarian activities, often working alongside Clinton, his former opponent. With George W. Bush's victory in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], Bush and his son became the second father\u2013son pair to serve as the nation's president, following [[John Adams]] and [[John Quincy Adams]]. Another son, [[Jeb Bush]], unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 Republican primaries]]. After a long battle with vascular [[Parkinson's disease]], Bush died at his home on November 30, 2018.

In May 1989, Noriega annulled the results of a democratic presidential election in which [[Guillermo Endara]] had been elected.

The invasion was the first large-scale American military operation in more than 40 years that was not related to the Cold War. American forces quickly took control of the Panama Canal Zone and [[Panama City]]. Noriega surrendered on January 3, 1990, and was quickly transported to a prison in the United States. Twenty-three Americans died in the operation, while another 394 were wounded. Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992.<ref name=\"patterson226227\"/> Historian Stewart Brewer argues that the invasion \"represented a new era in American foreign policy\" because Bush did not justify the invasion under the [[Monroe Doctrine]] or the threat of Communism, but rather on the grounds that it was in the best interests of the United States.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stewart Brewer|title=Borders and Bridges: A History of U.S.-Latin American Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HPod9HcYUJ4C&pg=PA146|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood |page=146|isbn=9780275982041}}</ref>\n\n====Gulf War====\n{{Main|Gulf War}}\n[[File:Iraq Kuwait Locator.svg|thumb|Iraq (green) invaded Kuwait (orange) in 1990]]\n\nFaced with massive debts and low oil prices in the aftermath of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], [[Iraq]]i leader [[Saddam Hussein]] decided to conquer the country of [[Kuwait]], a small, oil-rich country situated on Iraq's southern border.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 139\u2013141</ref> After Iraq [[Invasion of Kuwait|invaded]] Kuwait in August 1990, Bush imposed [[Sanctions against Iraq|economic sanctions]] on Iraq and assembled a [[Coalition of the Gulf War|multi-national coalition]] opposed to the invasion.<ref name=\"patterson230232\">Patterson (2005), pp. 230\u2013232</ref> The administration feared that a failure to respond to the invasion would embolden Hussein to attack [[Saudi Arabia]] or Israel, and wanted to discourage other countries from similar aggression.<ref>Herring (2008), pp. 908\u2013909</ref> Bush also wanted to ensure continued access to oil, as Iraq and Kuwait collectively accounted for 20 percent of the world's oil production, and Saudi Arabia produced another 26 percent of the world's oil supply.<ref>Patterson (2005), p. 233</ref>\n\nAt Bush's insistence, in November 1990, the [[United Nations Security Council]] approved a resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq did not withdrawal from Kuwait by January 15, 1991.<ref>Patterson (2005), p. 232</ref> Gorbachev's support, as well as China's abstention, helped ensure passage of the UN resolution.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 146\u2013147, 159</ref> Bush convinced Britain, France, and other nations to commit soldiers to an operation against Iraq, and he won important financial backing from Germany, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and the [[United Arab Emirates]].<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 149\u2013151</ref> In January 1991, Bush asked Congress to approve a joint resolution authorizing a war against Iraq.<ref name=\"patterson232233\">Patterson (2005), pp. 232\u2013233</ref> Bush believed that the UN resolution had already provided him with the necessary authorization to launch a military operation against Iraq, but he wanted to show that the nation was united behind a military action.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 160\u2013161</ref> Despite the opposition of a majority of Democrats in both the House and the Senate, Congress approved the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 1991]].<ref name=\"patterson232233\"/>\n\n[[File:President Bush meets with General Colin Powell, General Scowcroft, Secretary James Baker, Vice President Quayle... - NARA - 186429.tif|thumb|Bush meets with [[Robert Gates]], General [[Colin Powell]], Secretary [[Dick Cheney]] and others about the situation in the Persian Gulf]]\n\nAfter the January 15 deadline passed without an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, U.S. and coalition forces began a conducted a bombing campaign that devastated Iraq's power grid and communications network, and resulted in the desertion of about 100,000 Iraqi soldiers. In retaliation, Iraq launched [[Scud]] missiles at Israel and Saudi Arabia, but most of the missiles did little damage.

The compromise additionally included a [[PAYGO|\"pay as you go\"]] provision that required that new programs be paid for at the time of implementation.<ref name=\"greene100104\">Greene (2015), pp. 100\u2013104</ref> House Minority Whip [[Newt Gingrich]] led the conservative opposition to the bill, strongly opposing any form of tax increase.<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 446\u2013447</ref> Some liberals also criticized the budget cuts in the compromise, and in October, the House rejected the deal, resulting in a brief government shutdown. Without the strong backing of the Republican Party, Bush agreed to another compromise bill, this one more favorable to Democrats. The [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990]] (OBRA-90), enacted on October 27, 1990, dropped much of the gasoline tax increase in favor of higher income taxes on top earners. It included cuts to domestic spending, but the cuts were not as deep as those that had been proposed in the original compromise. Bush's decision to sign the bill damaged his standing with conservatives and the general public, but it also laid the groundwork for the budget surpluses of the late 1990s.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 104\u2013106</ref>\n\n====Civil rights====\n{{Quote box\n|title =\n|quote    =  \"Even the strongest person couldn't scale the [[Berlin Wall]] to gain the elusive promise of independence that lay just beyond.
