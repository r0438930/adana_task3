==Early life==
He was born Vilmos György Stern or Ze’ev HaKohen Stern in Budapest, the youngest of three children of Chaim Stern, who owned a textile factory supplying goods to the Hungarian government.<ref name=\"Rabbi Dunner\" />

When [[Operation Margarethe|Hungary was invaded]] by [[Nazi Germany]] in March 1944, Stern   along with his family, escaped on the [[Kastner train]], which carried 1,684 Jews to [[Switzerland during the World Wars|safety in Switzerland]].
== Career ==
During the 1960s, rising economic fortunes in Britain led to the creation of the first [[strategic business unit|unitised]] [[investment fund|property funds]]. Initially, only [[pension fund]]s and charities were permitted to purchase units in these trusts, but these regulations were relaxed under the leadership of Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] who came to power in 1970, after which time the general public could also invest via [[insurance companies]].

As a result of the [[1973–1974 stock market crash|stock market crash and secondary bank crisis of 1973–74]], property prices in Britain tumbled dramatically.

In 2013 he sold family valuables in his custody to a former longstanding creditor, but then refused to deliver them following payment, arguing he had not been entitled to sell them, then disobeyed a religious court order to deliver them.

==History==
[[File:K C College Churchgate Mumbai.jpg|thumb|K C College]]
Kishinchand Chellaram College was established in 1954<ref name = \"Kishinchand Chellaram College - About US\"/> under the aegis of the [[Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board]].  It was the second institution that the Management set up in Bombay after it relocated itself in the city, following the aftermath of Partition. The onus of the task was taken up by late founders, principal [[K.M. Kundnani]] and barrister [[Hotchand Advani]], who helped set up K.C. College as well as several other educational institutions. Kundnani and Advani were the pillars of that board.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} <ref>[http://www.kccollege.org.in/management.html History] Official website.</ref>

The [[R. D. National College]] was the first of the board's institutions and K.C. College was the second. The latter came to be reckoned{{By whom|date=January 2011}} as its flagship institution from where the board's activities were conducted.  The plot for the construction of K.C. College was leased from [[Ratanben Fauzdar]] for 99 years.  Under the draught plan of architect [[K.M. Gidwani]] and the management of principal Kundnani, the building was completed in six months. The foundation stone was laid by Shri Dinkarrao Desai, the minister for education.

Students were admitted from 1 June 1954 but a formal inauguration of the inception of the college was performed by [[Morarji Desai]] (the chief minister of [[Bombay]] State) on 15 August of the same year.  Its first batch comprised 1800 students and, within three years, the numbers have consistently increased.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Campus layout and facilities==

==History==
[[File:K C College Churchgate Mumbai.jpg|thumb|K C College]]
Kishinchand Chellaram College was established in 1954<ref name = \"Kishinchand Chellaram College - About US\"/> under the aegis of the [[Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board]].  It was the second institution that the Management set up in Bombay after it relocated itself in the city, following the aftermath of Partition. The onus of the task was taken up by late founders, principal [[K.M. Kundnani]] and barrister [[Hotchand Advani]], who helped set up K.C. College as well as several other educational institutions. Kundnani and Advani were the pillars of that board.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} <ref>[http://www.kccollege.org.in/management.html History] Official website.</ref>

The [[R. D. National College]] was the first of the board's institutions and K.C. College was the second. The latter came to be reckoned{{By whom|date=January 2011}} as its flagship institution from where the board's activities were conducted.  The plot for the construction of K.C. College was leased from [[Ratanben Fauzdar]] for 99 years.  Under the draught plan of architect [[K.M. Gidwani]] and the management of principal Kundnani, the building was completed in six months. The foundation stone was laid by Shri Dinkarrao Desai, the minister for education.

Students were admitted from 1 June 1954 but a formal inauguration of the inception of the college was performed by [[Morarji Desai]] (the chief minister of [[Bombay]] State) on 15 August of the same year.  Its first batch comprised 1800 students and, within three years, the numbers have consistently increased.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Campus layout and facilities==
[[File:Kishinchand Chellaram College building.jpg|thumb|K.C. College campus]]
[[File:Kishinchand Chellaram College library.jpg|thumb|Campus library]]
The building had an area of {{convert|70000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}{{Citation needed|date= February 2012}} and was built in the restrained art-deco style that dominated the architectural design ethic in the city since the 1920s. The college today has an air-conditioned auditorium with nearly 600 seating capacity, a parquet indoor badminton court and a community hall. The Department of Mass Media now operates through its new Colaba campus building. {{Citation needed|date= February 2012}}

==Scraps companion album==<!-- This section is linked from [[Alkaline Trio]] -->
On [[Valentine's Day]] 2007, the band posted a bulletin on their MySpace giving a downloadable template and cipher.
When printed and aligned correctly with the booklet in the ''Remains'' album, the template gave a user name and a password.
When the cipher was deciphered, it gave a web address to go to.
This website contained a downloadable album and cover file.
The cipher and template accessible to Blood Pact members was different from those of the general public.

==Scraps companion album==<!-- This section is linked from [[Alkaline Trio]] -->
On [[Valentine's Day]] 2007, the band posted a bulletin on their MySpace giving a downloadable template and cipher.
When printed and aligned correctly with the booklet in the ''Remains'' album, the template gave a user name and a password.
When the cipher was deciphered, it gave a web address to go to.
This website contained a downloadable album and cover file.
The cipher and template accessible to Blood Pact members was different from those of the general public.

While there, he was a student of Professors Dean Alfange, Jr. and [[Sheldon Goldman]].<ref name=\"UMASS\">{{cite web |url=http://www.umass.edu/sbs/news_events/news_stories/murphy.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419080503/http://www.umass.edu/sbs/news_events/news_stories/murphy.htm |archivedate=2010-04-19 }}</ref> In 1978, Murphy received his Ph.D. in Government and Foreign Affairs from the [[University of Virginia]] where he studied with Professors [[Henry J.

== Book publications ==

Professor Murphy is the author of four [[judicial biographies]], the co-author of a text book, and the editor of a reader.<ref>http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=Bruce+Allen+Murphy</ref> In addition, he is the author of many book chapters, speeches, and articles in professional journals.

Professor Murphy's first book, ''The Brandeis/Frankfurter Connection: The Secret Political Activities of Two Supreme Court Justices,'' published in 1982 by Oxford University Press,<ref>Murphy, Bruce Allen, ''The Brandeis/Frankfurter Connection: The Secret Political Activities of Two Supreme Court Justices,'' Oxford University Press, 1982</ref> was the subject of a front-page story in the Sunday [[New York Times|New York ''Times'']].<ref>New York ''Times,'' 14 Feb 1982, pg. 1</ref> The book contained details about the financial relationship between Justice [[Louis D. Brandeis]] and then-Harvard law professor [[Felix Frankfurter]]. While on the Court, Brandeis provided Frankfurter with funds to promote a variety of political reforms. The book sparked a national debate about the ethics of extrajudicial activities by Supreme Court justices.

In 1988, Professor Murphy's second book, ''Fortas: The Rise and Ruin of a Supreme Court Justice,''<ref name=\"RISE;RUIN\">Murphy, Bruce Allen, ''Fortas: The Rise and Ruin of a Supreme Court Justice,'' William Morrow & Co., 1988</ref> followed the life and career of [[Abe Fortas]] who resigned from the U.S. Supreme Court after his close political ties to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and his financial relationship with [[Louis Wolfson]], a potential litigant before the Court, came to light. Published by [[William Morrow & Co.]].

A later biography, ''Wild Bill: The Legend and Life of [[William O. Douglas]],''<ref>Murphy, Bruce Allen, ''Wild Bill: The Legend and Life of William O. Douglas,'' Random House, 2003</ref> was published in 2003 by [[Random House]], and examines the life and work of the longest-serving Supreme Court justice in U.S. history.

He was constantly running for political office, seeking political appointments and playing politics.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alandershowitz.com/publications/docs/WildBill.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930055112/http://www.alandershowitz.com/publications/docs/WildBill.html |archivedate=2011-09-30 }}</ref>

In addition to his judicial biographies, Professor Murphy is the co-author (with Larry Berman) of an American Government textbook, ''Approaching Democracy,'' with [[Pearson Education]], now in its eighth edition.

The '''Battle of Adwalton Moor''' was a battle in the [[First English Civil War]] on 30 June 1643.

==Battle==
The [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Earl of Newcastle]], the Royalist commander, was marching on Bradford (which was [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] in sympathy) with 10,000 men. [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Fairfax]], the Parliamentary commander, had 3,000-4,000 men in Bradford. Despite inferior numbers, Fairfax came to intercept the Royalist army, as Bradford was ill-prepared to resist a siege. 

The Parliamentarians were due to leave Bradford at 4:00&nbsp;am, but left much later on account of the \"laxity or worse of General Gifford\".<ref>Paige, p. 423.</ref> When they arrived at Adwalton Moor, the Royalist commander had deployed his army effectively and despite early success by the Parliamentarians, the Royalists decisively defeated them.<ref>Battle of Adwalton Moor 1643, PastScape.</ref>

The battle consolidated Royalist control of Yorkshire, and has been deemed of low or medium term significance. However, historians have acknowledged that the impact of the battle, which left the Parliamentarians with only one stronghold in the north ([[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]) and forced the Parliamentarians into a religious and political alliance with Scotland. This in turn, led to a Parliamentary victory at the [[Battle of Marston Moor]] a year later in 1644.<ref>Ginley.</ref> [[Historic England]] labelled the battle as second only in importance to Marston Moor.<ref name=\":HE:\">Battle of Adwalton Moor 1643, Historic England.</ref>

==Background==
The site of the battle is high ground in [[Adwalton]] (now commonly considered to be part of [[Drighlington]]) near [[Bradford]], which is now in an area of [[rural-urban fringe]], (map reference SE2228).<ref>Adwalton Moor Battlefield Heritage Impact Assessment, p. 15.</ref> Parts of the site are protected as \"[[green belt]]\" or other types of open space with the [[A650 road]] cutting right through the battlefield.<ref>English Heritage Battlefield Report: Adwalton Moor 1643.</ref> It is the only battlefield recognised by [[Bradford Metropolitan District Council]] as falling within its boundaries but it actually lies within the Leeds City Council boundary.<ref>Adwalton Moor Battlefield Heritage Impact Assessment, p. 2.</ref> There are plaques interpreting the battlefield for visitors.<ref name=\":HE:\" />

Prior to the battle, the Royalists captured Parliamentary-held [[Howley Hall]] ({{Convert|4.5|km|mi}} southeast of Adwalton) to secure their advance on Bradford. This was their starting point for their march on Bradford on 30 June 1643.<ref name=\":0\">Howley Hall; a 16th century country house and gardens.</ref>

==Museum displays==
There is a display relating to the battle at [[Bolling Hall, Bradford]], a museum which lies a few miles from the site and was itself a Royalist base. [[Oakwell Hall]] is another museum which throws light on the civil war in [[Yorkshire]]: although the hall is situated within walking distance from the battlefield, it falls outside the boundaries of Bradford and within those of [[Kirklees]].

The '''Battle of Adwalton Moor''' was a battle in the [[English Civil War]] on 30 June 1643.

==Battle==
The [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Earl of Newcastle]], the Royalist commander, was marching on Bradford (which was [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] in sympathy) with 10,000 men. [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Fairfax]], the Parliamentary commander, had 3,000-4,000 men in Bradford. Despite inferior numbers, Fairfax came to intercept the Royalist army, as Bradford was ill-prepared to resist a siege. 

The Parliamentarians were due to leave Bradford at 4:00&nbsp;am, but left much later on account of the \"laxity or worse of General Gifford\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Paige|first1=William|title=The Victoria history of the counties of England. The Victoria history of the county of York, Volume 3|date=1913|publisher=Constable|location=London|page=423|oclc=504890096}}</ref> When they arrived at Adwalton Moor, the Royalist commander had deployed his army effectively and despite early success by the Parliamentarians, the strong Royalists defeated them.<ref>{{PastScape |num=51203 |desc=Battle of Adwalton Moor 1643|access-date=15 November 2017}}</ref>

The battle consolidated Royalist control of Yorkshire, and has  been deemed of low or medium term significance. However, historians have acknowledged that the impact of the battle, which left the Parliamentarians with only one stronghold in the north ([[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]), forced the Parliamentarians into a religious and political alliance with Scotland. This in turn, led to a Parliamentary victory at the [[Battle of Marston Moor]] a year later in 1644.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ginley|first1=Joanne|title=New theory on civil war's 'forgotten battle'|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/new-theory-on-civil-war-s-forgotten-battle-1-2527423|accessdate=15 November 2017|work=The Yorkshire Post|date=7 September 2003}}</ref> [[Historic England]] labelled the battle as second only in importance to Marston Moor.<ref name=\":HE:\">{{National Heritage List for England|num=1000000|desc=Battle of Adwalton Moor 1643|grade=<!-- not applicable to this listing-->|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref>

==Background==
The site of the battle is high ground in [[Adwalton]] (now commonly considered to be part of [[Drighlington]]) near [[Bradford]], which is now in an area of [[rural-urban fringe]], (map reference SE2228).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.gov.uk/Documents/planningStrategy/06%20Examination/07%20Additional%20documents%20submitted%20by%20the%20Council%20referred%20to%20in%20MIQs//PS%20E010%20-%20Adwalton%20Moor%20battlefield%20heritage%20impact%20assessments.pdf|title=Adwalton Moor Battlefield Heritage Impact Assessment|date=February 2015|website=bradford.gov.uk|page=15|format=PDF|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> Parts of the site are protected as \"[[green belt]]\" or other types of open space with the [[A650 road]] cutting right through the battlefield.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://content.historicengland.org.uk/content/docs/battlefields/adwalton.pdf|title=English Heritage Battlefield Report: Adwalton Moor 1643|date=1995|website=historicengland.co.uk|format=PDF|accessdate=15 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412062011/https://content.historicengland.org.uk/content/docs/battlefields/adwalton.pdf|archive-date=12 April 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is the only battlefield recognised by [[Bradford Metropolitan District Council]] as falling within its boundaries but it actually lies within the Leeds City Council boundary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.gov.uk/Documents/planningStrategy/06%20Examination/07%20Additional%20documents%20submitted%20by%20the%20Council%20referred%20to%20in%20MIQs//PS%20E010%20-%20Adwalton%20Moor%20battlefield%20heritage%20impact%20assessments.pdf|title=Adwalton Moor Battlefield Heritage Impact Assessment|date=February 2015|website=bradford.gov.uk|page=2|format=PDF|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> There are plaques interpreting the battlefield for visitors.<ref name=\":HE:\" />

Prior to the battle, the Royalists captured Parliamentary-held [[Howley Hall]] ({{Convert|4.5|km|mi}} southeast of Adwalton) to secure their advance on Bradford. This was their starting point for their march on Bradford on 30 June 1643.<ref name=\":0\">{{NHLE|num=1016323|desc=Howley Hall; a 16th century country house and gardens, Morley|date=|accessdate=2017-11-23}}</ref>

==Museum displays==
There is a display relating to the battle at [[Bolling Hall, Bradford]], a museum which lies a few miles from the site and was itself a Royalist base. [[Oakwell Hall]] is another museum which throws light on the civil war in [[Yorkshire]]: although the hall is situated within walking distance from the battlefield, it falls outside the boundaries of Bradford and within those of [[Kirklees]].

==History==
[[File:K C College Churchgate Mumbai.jpg|thumb|K C College]]
Kishinchand Chellaram College was established in 1954<ref name = \"Kishinchand Chellaram College - About US\"/> under the aegis of the [[Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board]].  It was the second institution that the Management set up in Bombay after it relocated itself in the city, following the aftermath of Partition. The onus of the task was taken up by late founders, principal [[K.M. Kundnani]] and barrister [[Hotchand Advani]], who helped set up K.C. College as well as several other educational institutions. Kundnani and Advani were the pillars of that board.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} <ref>[http://www.kccollege.org.in/management.html History] Official website.</ref>

The [[R. D. National College]] was the first of the board's institutions and K.C. College was the second. The latter came to be reckoned{{By whom|date=January 2011}} as its flagship institution from where the board's activities were conducted.  The plot for the construction of K.C. College was leased from [[Ratanben Fauzdar]] for 99 years.  Under the draught plan of architect [[K.M. Gidwani]] and the management of principal Kundnani, the building was completed in six months. The foundation stone was laid by Shri Dinkarrao Desai, the minister for education.

Students were admitted from 1 June 1954 but a formal inauguration of the inception of the college was performed by [[Morarji Desai]] (the chief minister of [[Bombay]] State) on 15 August of the same year.  Its first batch comprised 1800 students and, within three years, the numbers have consistently increased.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[Image:Asa Peabody Blunt.jpg |thumb |upright |alt=seated man with beard in uniform |[[Asa P. Blunt]] commanded the 12th during its nine months in 1863]]

The '''12th Regiment, Vermont Volunteer Infantry''' (or 12th VVI) was a nine months' infantry regiment in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. It served in the eastern theater, predominantly in the Defenses of Washington, from October 1862 to July 1863. It was a member of the [[2nd Vermont Brigade]].

==History==

The 12th Vermont Infantry, a nine months regiment, raised as a result of President Lincoln's call on August 4, 1862, for additional troops due to the disastrous results of the Peninsula Campaign.

It was composed of volunteers from ten volunteer militia companies as follows:

* [[West Windsor, Vermont|West Windsor]] Guards, Co. A
* [[Woodstock, Vermont|Woodstock]] Light Infantry, Co. B
* Howard Guard of [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], Co. C
* July 14th, 1863 has Company G under the command of Ebenzer J. Ornisbill (spelling ?)
* [[Tunbridge, Vermont|Tunbridge]] Light Infantry, Co. D
* Ransom Guards of [[St. Albans (city), Vermont|St. Albans]], Co. E
* New England Guard of [[Northfield, Vermont|Northfield]], Co. F
* Allen Grays of [[Brandon, Vermont|Brandon]], Co. G
* [[Bradford, Vermont|Bradford]] Guards, Co. H
* Saxton's River Light Infantry of [[Rockingham, Vermont|Rockingham]], Co. I
* [[Rutland (town), Vermont|Rutland]] Light Guard, Co. K

Colonel [[Asa P. Blunt]], previously of the [[3rd Vermont Infantry|3rd]] and [[6th Vermont Infantry|6th Vermont]] regiments, was selected to command the regiment. Lieutenant Colonel [[Roswell Farnham]] and Major Levi G. Kingsley had held commissions in the [[1st Vermont Infantry]], along with a total of 65 officers and men.

The regiment went into camp at [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]] on September 25, 1862, and was mustered into United States service on October 4. It left [[Vermont]] on October 7, and arrived in [[Washington, D.C.]] on October 10, and went into camp on East Capital Hill. On October 30 it became part of the [[2nd Vermont Brigade]], which also included the [[13th Vermont Infantry|13th]], [[14th Vermont Infantry|14th]], [[15th Vermont Infantry|15th]] and [[16th Vermont Infantry]] regiments.

Colonel Blunt, as ranking colonel, commanded the brigade until the arrival of Brigadier General [[Edwin H. Stoughton]], on December 7.

Stoughton was not popular with the officers and men of the brigade, so when he was captured by Confederate partisan [[John S. Mosby]] on March 9, 1863, few mourned his loss. Colonel Blunt assumed command of the brigade again, turning it over to the new brigade commander, Brigadier General [[George J. Stannard]], on April 20, who led the brigade until the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].

The regiment marched to [[Munson's Hill]] on October 30, and Hunting Creek the next day, where it stayed until December 12, in 'Camp Vermont.' It was engaged in picket duty near Fairfax Courthouse from December 12 to January 20, 1863, participating in a repulse of [[J.E.B. Stuart]]'s cavalry on December 29. The regiment was stationed at [[Wolf Run Shoals]] from January 20 to May 1, performed railroad guard duty at Warrenton Junction until May 7, and camped near Rappahannock Station until May 18. From then until June 1, it camped near Bristoe and Catlett's Station. For the majority of June, it was at Union Mills.

On June 25, the brigade was assigned as the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, [[I Corps (ACW)|I Corps]], and ordered to form the rear guard of the [[Army of the Potomac]] as it marched north after [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The 12th marched with the brigade from [[Wolf Run Shoals]] on June 25, crossed the Potomac river on June 27, at Edward's Ferry, and moved north through Frederick City and Creagerstown, Maryland. It was drawing near [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]] on July 1, when the 12th and 15th regiments were detached to guard the corps trains.

The regiment accompanied the corps trains to Rock Creek Church, near the battlefield, and two companies of the 12th went forward to protect ammunition trains on the Taneytown road.

After the battle, the regiment moved south to [[Westminster, Maryland]], then served as guards for a train of 2,500 Confederate prisoners who were taken to [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. Departing Baltimore, the regiment traveled to [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], where it arrived on July 9. It was mustered out on July 14, 1863.

Dozens of newly discharged members of the regiment enlisted again, predominantly in the regiments of the 1st [[Vermont Brigade]], and the [[17th Vermont Infantry]].

[[Image:Asa Peabody Blunt.jpg |thumb |upright |alt=seated man with beard in uniform |[[Asa P. Blunt]] commanded the 12th during its nine months in 1863]]

The '''12th Regiment, Vermont Volunteer Infantry''' (or 12th VVI) was a nine months' infantry regiment in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. It served in the eastern theater, predominantly in the Defenses of Washington, from October 1862 to July 1863. It was a member of the [[2nd Vermont Brigade]].

==History==

The 12th Vermont Infantry, a nine months regiment, raised as a result of President Lincoln's call on August 4, 1862, for additional troops due to the disastrous results of the Peninsula Campaign.

It was composed of volunteers from ten volunteer militia companies as follows:

* [[West Windsor, Vermont|West Windsor]] Guards, Co. A
* [[Woodstock, Vermont|Woodstock]] Light Infantry, Co. B
* Howard Guard of [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], Co. C
* July 14th, 1863 has Company G under the command of Ebenzer J. Ornisbill (spelling ?)
* [[Tunbridge, Vermont|Tunbridge]] Light Infantry, Co. D
* Ransom Guards of [[St. Albans (city), Vermont|St. Albans]], Co. E
* New England Guard of [[Northfield, Vermont|Northfield]], Co. F
* Allen Grays of [[Brandon, Vermont|Brandon]], Co. G
* [[Bradford, Vermont|Bradford]] Guards, Co. H
* Saxton's River Light Infantry of [[Rockingham, Vermont|Rockingham]], Co. I
* [[Rutland (town), Vermont|Rutland]] Light Guard, Co. K

Colonel [[Asa P. Blunt]], previously of the [[3rd Vermont Infantry|3rd]] and [[6th Vermont Infantry|6th Vermont]] regiments, was selected to command the regiment. Lieutenant Colonel [[Roswell Farnham]] and Major Levi G. Kingsley had held commissions in the [[1st Vermont Infantry]], along with a total of 65 officers and men.

The regiment went into camp at [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]] on September 25, 1862, and was mustered into United States service on October 4. It left [[Vermont]] on October 7, and arrived in [[Washington, D.C.]] on October 10, and went into camp on East Capital Hill. On October 30 it became part of the [[2nd Vermont Brigade]], which also included the [[13th Vermont Infantry|13th]], [[14th Vermont Infantry|14th]], [[15th Vermont Infantry|15th]] and [[16th Vermont Infantry]] regiments.

Colonel Blunt, as ranking colonel, commanded the brigade until the arrival of Brigadier General [[Edwin H. Stoughton]], on December 7.

Stoughton was not popular with the officers and men of the brigade, so when he was captured by Confederate partisan [[John S. Mosby]] on March 9, 1863, few mourned his loss. Colonel Blunt assumed command of the brigade again, turning it over to the new brigade commander, Brigadier General [[George J. Stannard]], on April 20, who led the brigade until the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].

The regiment marched to [[Munson's Hill]] on October 30, and Hunting Creek the next day, where it stayed until December 12, in 'Camp Vermont.' It was engaged in picket duty near Fairfax Courthouse from December 12 to January 20, 1863, participating in a repulse of [[J.E.B. Stuart]]'s cavalry on December 29. The regiment was stationed at [[Wolf Run Shoals]] from January 20 to May 1, performed railroad guard duty at Warrenton Junction until May 7, and camped near Rappahannock Station until May 18. From then until June 1, it camped near Bristoe and Catlett's Station. For the majority of June, it was at Union Mills.

On June 25, the brigade was assigned as the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, [[I Corps (ACW)|I Corps]], and ordered to form the rear guard of the [[Army of the Potomac]] as it marched north after [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The 12th marched with the brigade from [[Wolf Run Shoals]] on June 25, crossed the Potomac river on June 27, at Edward's Ferry, and moved north through Frederick City and Creagerstown, Maryland. It was drawing near [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]] on July 1, when the 12th and 15th regiments were detached to guard the corps trains.

The regiment accompanied the corps trains to Rock Creek Church, near the battlefield, and two companies of the 12th went forward to protect ammunition trains on the Taneytown road.

After the battle, the regiment moved south to [[Westminster, Maryland]], then served as guards for a train of 2,500 Confederate prisoners who were taken to [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. Departing Baltimore, the regiment traveled to [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], where it arrived on July 9. It was mustered out on July 14, 1863.

Dozens of newly discharged members of the regiment enlisted again, predominantly in the regiments of the 1st [[Vermont Brigade]], and the [[17th Vermont Infantry]].

Unfortunately, [[Zuleikha (tradition)|Potiphar's wife]], who was known for her infidelities, took a liking to Joseph, and attempted to seduce him. When Joseph refused her advances, and ran off, she retaliated by falsely accusing him of trying to [[rape]] her, and Potiphar had Joseph imprisoned. According to G.J. Wenham ([[Inter-Varsity Press|IVP]] New Bible Commentary), [[capital punishment|execution]] was normal in rape cases, and so the story implies that Potiphar had doubts about his wife's account.

What happened to Potiphar after that is unclear; some sources identify him as [[Potipherah]], an Egyptian priest whose daughter, [[Asenath]], marries Joseph.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12316-potiphar|title=POTIPHAR - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}</ref> The false accusation by Potiphar's wife plays an important role in Joseph's narrative, because had he not been imprisoned, he would not have met the fellow prisoner who introduced him to Pharaoh.

The medieval [[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer HaYashar]], a commentary on the [[Torah]], gives Potiphar's wife's name as [[Zuleika (legendary)|Zuleikha]], as do many Islamic traditions - thus the Persian poem called [[Yusuf and Zulaikha]] from [[Jami]]'s ''[[Haft Awrang]]'' (\"Seven thrones\").

The story became a very common subject in Western art during the Renaissance and [[Baroque]] periods, usually depicting the moment when Joseph tears himself away from the bed containing a more-or-less naked figure of Potiphar's wife. [[Persian miniature]]s often illustrate [[Yusuf and Zulaikha]] in [[Jami]]'s ''[[Haft Awrang]]'' (\"Seven thrones\").

It is difficult to tie Potiphar or Joseph accurately to a particular pharaoh or time period. According to the [[Jewish calendar]], Joseph was purchased in the year 2216, which is 1544 BC, at the end of the [[Second Intermediate Period]] or very beginning of the [[New Kingdom]]. The [[Torah]] in which the story appears (see also the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]]), was the earliest written of the three: c. 600 BC during the Babylonian Exile. According to the [[documentary hypothesis]], the story of Potiphar and his wife is credited to the [[Yahwist]] source, and stands in the same place that the stories of the butler and the baker and Pharaoh's dreams stand in the [[Elohist]] text.

The [[Book of Abraham]], included in the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]], one of the [[standard works]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and by churches of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], refers to a \"Potiphar`s Hill\" in Egypt (Abraham 1:10, 20).

*In ''[[Joseph and his Brothers]]'', [[Thomas Mann]] suggests that Potiphar's wife is sexually frustrated partly because Potiphar is a [[eunuch]].
In Margaret Atwood's [[The Testaments]], the sequel to ''The Handmaid's Tale,'' Potiphor's wife is referred to in Chapter 46 of the Ardua Hall Holograph storyline as narrated by Aunt Lydia. She mentions that Dr. Grove defended himself against attempted rape charges through the Potiphar vignette.

Unfortunately, [[Zuleikha (tradition)|Potiphar's wife]], who was known for her infidelities, took a liking to Joseph, and attempted to seduce him. When Joseph refused her advances, and ran off, she retaliated by falsely accusing him of trying to [[rape]] her, and Potiphar had Joseph imprisoned. According to G.J. Wenham ([[Inter-Varsity Press|IVP]] New Bible Commentary), [[capital punishment|execution]] was normal in rape cases, and so the story implies that Potiphar had doubts about his wife's account.

What happened to Potiphar after that is unclear; some sources identify him as [[Potipherah]], an Egyptian priest whose daughter, [[Asenath]], marries Joseph.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12316-potiphar|title=Potiphar – JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}</ref> The false accusation by Potiphar's wife plays an important role in Joseph's narrative, because had he not been imprisoned, he would not have met the fellow prisoner who introduced him to Pharaoh.

The medieval [[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer HaYashar]], a commentary on the [[Torah]], gives Potiphar's wife's name as [[Zuleika (legendary)|Zuleikha]], as do many Islamic traditions - thus the Persian poem called [[Yusuf and Zulaikha]] from [[Jami]]'s ''[[Haft Awrang]]'' (\"Seven thrones\").

The story became a very common subject in Western art during the Renaissance and [[Baroque]] periods, usually depicting the moment when Joseph tears himself away from the bed containing a more-or-less naked figure of Potiphar's wife. [[Persian miniature]]s often illustrate [[Yusuf and Zulaikha]] in [[Jami]]'s ''[[Haft Awrang]]'' (\"Seven thrones\").

It is difficult to tie Potiphar or Joseph accurately to a particular pharaoh or time period. According to the [[Jewish calendar]], Joseph was purchased in the year 2216, which is 1544 BC, at the end of the [[Second Intermediate Period]] or very beginning of the [[New Kingdom]]. The [[Torah]] in which the story appears (see also the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]]), was the earliest written of the three: c. 600 BC during the Babylonian Exile. According to the [[documentary hypothesis]], the story of Potiphar and his wife is credited to the [[Yahwist]] source, and stands in the same place that the stories of the butler and the baker and Pharaoh's dreams stand in the [[Elohist]] text.

The [[Book of Abraham]], included in the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]], one of the [[standard works]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and by churches of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], refers to a \"Potiphar`s Hill\" in Egypt (Abraham 1:10, 20).

'''Lucio Russo''' (born 22 November 1944) is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[physicist]], [[mathematician]] and [[historian]] of science. Born in [[Venice]], he teaches at the Mathematics Department of the [[University of Rome Tor Vergata]].

Among his main areas of interest are [[Gibbs measure]] of the [[Ising model]], [[percolation theory]],<ref>Geoffrey R. Grimmett, \"The Work of Lucio Russo on Percolation\",\"[[Mathematics and Mechanics of Complex Systems]]\", vol.&nbsp;4, N°&nbsp;3–4, pp.&nbsp;199–211 http://msp.org/memocs/2016/4-3/p02.xhtml</ref> and finite [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli]] schemes, within which he proved an approximate version of the classical [[Kolmogorov's zero–one law]].<ref>M. Talegrand \"On Russo's approximate zero-one law\", “[[Annals of Probability]]”, 22, (1994), 1576–1587</ref>

In the history of science, he has reconstructed some contributions of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] astronomer [[Hipparchus]], through the analysis of his surviving works, and the proof of [[heliocentrism]] attributed by [[Plutarch]] to [[Seleucus of Seleucia]] and studied the history of theories of [[tide]]s<ref>Lucio Russo, ''Flussi e riflussi: indagine sull'origine di una teoria scientifica'', Milan, Feltrinelli, 2003, {{ISBN|88-07-10349-4}}.</ref>, from the Hellenistic to modern age.

== Books ==

=== ''The Forgotten Revolution'' ===
In ''The Forgotten Revolution: How Science Was Born in 300 BC and Why It Had to Be Reborn'' (Italian: ''La rivoluzione dimenticata''), Russo promotes the belief that Hellenistic science in the period 320–144 BC reached heights not achieved by [[Classical age]] science, and proposes that it went further than ordinarily thought, in multiple fields not normally associated with ancient science.

According to Russo, Hellenistic scientists were not simply forerunners, but actually achieved scientific results of high importance, in the fields of \"mathematics, solid and fluid mechanics, optics, astronomy, anatomy, physiology, scientific medicine,\"<ref name=\"graffi\">Graffi, Sandro, review of ''La rivoluzione dimenticata'', ''Notices Amer. Math. Soc.'', vol. 45, no. 5, May 1998.[http://www.ams.org/notices/199805/review-graffi.pdf]</ref> even psychoanalysis. They may have even discovered the [[inverse square law]] of [[gravitation]] (Russo's argument on this point hinges on well-established, but seldom discussed, evidence). Hellenistic scientists, among whom [[Euclid]], [[Archimedes]], [[Eratosthenes]], developed an axiomatic and deductive way of argumentation. When this way of argumentation was dropped, the ability to understand the results were lost as well. Thus Russo conjectures that the definitions of elementary geometric objects were introduced in Euclid's ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' by [[Heron of Alexandria]], 400 years after the work was completed.<ref name=\"graffi\" /> More concretely, Russo shows how the theory of tides must have been well-developed in Antiquity, because several pre-Newtonian sources relay various complementary parts of the theory without grasping their import or justification (getting the empirical facts wrong but the theory right).

Hellenistic science was focused on the city of [[Alexandria]]. The emerging scientific revolution in Alexandria was ended when [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]] came to power. He engaged in mass purges and expulsions of all intellectuals. Other centers of Hellenistic science mentioned in Russo's book were [[Antioch]], [[Pergamon]], [[Cyzicus]], [[Rhodes]], [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] and [[Massilia]].

He also concludes that the 17th-century scientific revolution in Europe was due in large part to the recovery of Hellenistic science.<ref>Lucio Russo, ''The Forgotten Revolution: How Science Was Born in 300 BC and Why It Had to Be Reborn'', Berlin, Springer, 2004, {{ISBN|978-3-540-20396-4}}.</ref> ''The Forgotten Revolution'' has received mixed reviews, praising Russo's enthusiasm but noting that his conclusions outreach his sources.<ref>Michael Rowan-Robinson, \"[http://physicsweb.org/articles/review/17/4/1/1 Praising Alexandrians to excess].\" Review of ''The Forgotten Revolution'', ''[[Physics World]]'' vol. 17, no. 4 (April 2004).</ref><ref>Gary B.

In ''L&apos;America dimenticata'', Russo suggests that the Americas were known to some European civilizations in ancient times, probably discovered by the [[Phoenicians]] or the [[Carthaginians]], but that the knowledge was lost under Roman expansion in the second century BC.<ref>Lucio Russo, ''L&apos; America dimenticata.

Russo notes paintings dating to the [[Rome|Roman]] period and representing American fruits (''[[Ananas]]''), and small [[Mesoamerican]] toys representing wheeled trucks, when the wheel had not been invented nor used in pre-Columbian times.

With the collapse of the Hellenistic world under the attacks of the Romans around the middle of the 2nd century BC (specifically, the destruction of [[Corinth]] and [[Carthage]] in 146 BC and the expulsion of the scientific elite from [[Alexandria]] in 145 BC), these geographic notions were lost. Later [[Ptolemy]] incorrectly identified the Blessed Islands with the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]] and since it was known that the Blessed Islands were at the antipodes relative to the eastern part of China, Ptolemy made ends meet by erroneously enlarging the longitude of all known places, and shrinking the width of a degree of longitude (500 instead of 700 stadia).

'''Lucio Russo''' (born 22 November 1944) is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[physicist]], [[mathematician]] and [[historian]] of science. Born in [[Venice]], he teaches at the Mathematics Department of the [[University of Rome Tor Vergata]].

Among his main areas of interest are [[Gibbs measure]] of the [[Ising model]], [[percolation theory]],<ref>Geoffrey R. Grimmett, \"The Work of Lucio Russo on Percolation\",\"[[Mathematics and Mechanics of Complex Systems]]\", vol.&nbsp;4, N°&nbsp;3–4, pp.&nbsp;199–211 http://msp.org/memocs/2016/4-3/p02.xhtml</ref> and finite [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli]] schemes, within which he proved an approximate version of the classical [[Kolmogorov's zero–one law]].<ref>M. Talegrand \"On Russo's approximate zero-one law\", “[[Annals of Probability]]”, 22, (1994), 1576–1587</ref>

In the history of science, he has reconstructed some contributions of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] astronomer [[Hipparchus]], through the analysis of his surviving works, and the proof of [[heliocentrism]] attributed by [[Plutarch]] to [[Seleucus of Seleucia]] and studied the history of theories of [[tide]]s<ref>Lucio Russo, ''Flussi e riflussi: indagine sull'origine di una teoria scientifica'', Milan, Feltrinelli, 2003, {{ISBN|88-07-10349-4}}.</ref>, from the Hellenistic to modern age.

=== ''The Forgotten Revolution'' ===
In ''The Forgotten Revolution: How Science Was Born in 300 BC and Why It Had to Be Reborn'' (Italian: ''La rivoluzione dimenticata''), Russo promotes the belief that Hellenistic science in the period 320–144 BC reached heights not achieved by [[Classical age]] science, and proposes that it went further than ordinarily thought, in multiple fields not normally associated with ancient science.

According to Russo, Hellenistic scientists were not simply forerunners, but actually achieved scientific results of high importance, in the fields of \"mathematics, solid and fluid mechanics, optics, astronomy, anatomy, physiology, scientific medicine,\"<ref name=\"graffi\">Graffi, Sandro, review of ''La rivoluzione dimenticata'', ''Notices Amer. Math. Soc.'', vol. 45, no. 5, May 1998.[http://www.ams.org/notices/199805/review-graffi.pdf]</ref> even psychoanalysis. They may have even discovered the [[inverse square law]] of [[gravitation]] (Russo's argument on this point hinges on well-established, but seldom discussed, evidence). Hellenistic scientists, among whom [[Euclid]], [[Archimedes]], [[Eratosthenes]], developed an axiomatic and deductive way of argumentation. When this way of argumentation was dropped, the ability to understand the results were lost as well. Thus Russo conjectures that the definitions of elementary geometric objects were introduced in Euclid's ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' by [[Heron of Alexandria]], 400 years after the work was completed.<ref name=\"graffi\" /> More concretely, Russo shows how the theory of tides must have been well-developed in Antiquity, because several pre-Newtonian sources relay various complementary parts of the theory without grasping their import or justification (getting the empirical facts wrong but the theory right).

Hellenistic science was focused on the city of [[Alexandria]]. The emerging scientific revolution in Alexandria was ended when [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]] came to power. He engaged in mass purges and expulsions of all intellectuals. Other centers of Hellenistic science mentioned in Russo's book were [[Antioch]], [[Pergamon]], [[Cyzicus]], [[Rhodes]], [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] and [[Massilia]].

He also concludes that the 17th-century scientific revolution in Europe was due in large part to the recovery of Hellenistic science.<ref>Lucio Russo, ''The Forgotten Revolution: How Science Was Born in 300 BC and Why It Had to Be Reborn'', Berlin, Springer, 2004, {{ISBN|978-3-540-20396-4}}.</ref> ''The Forgotten Revolution'' has received mixed reviews, praising Russo's enthusiasm but noting that his conclusions outreach his sources.<ref>Michael Rowan-Robinson, \"[http://physicsweb.org/articles/review/17/4/1/1 Praising Alexandrians to excess].\" Review of ''The Forgotten Revolution'', ''[[Physics World]]'' vol. 17, no. 4 (April 2004).</ref><ref>Gary B.

'''Fort Valley''' is a [[mountain]] [[valley]] in [[Shenandoah County, Virginia|Shenandoah County]], [[Virginia]].<ref name=GNIS>{{cite GNIS|1483500|Fort Valley|December 12, 2016}}</ref>  It is often called \"valley within a valley\" as it lies between the two arms of the northern [[Massanutten Mountain]] range in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], which are part of the  in the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]].  The eastern ridgeline of Fort Valley is named Massanutten Mountain and is basically continuous for the eastern length of Fort Valley.  The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the Massanutten range, is composed of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain, which has a smaller highland valley called Little Fort Valley between it and the western ridgelines. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains and promontories within Fort Valley.

Fort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point called Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the entire valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountains in the south and flowing north, aided by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. 

Fort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. 

==Roads and Gaps==

Between Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the Woodstock Tower, which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain offering panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley. Woodstock Tower is a historic observation post built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. 

Between Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley on the east, over Massanutten Mountain, from Camp Roosevelt to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.

Roads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over [[Powell Mountain]].

==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==

The [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above Shenandoah State Park on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. 

The [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.

Fort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)

==History==
According to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley from the north, at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible last stand against the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. The [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] made Washington's plans unnecessary.

[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 – 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.

Signal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley that offers sweeping and unobstructed panoramic views of of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as a strategic military observation post. The observation post can view the nearby Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook. It's accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace.

The [[Daniel Munch House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>

'''Fort Valley''' is a [[mountain]] [[valley]] in [[Shenandoah County, Virginia|Shenandoah County]], [[Virginia]].<ref name=GNIS>{{cite GNIS|1483500|Fort Valley|December 12, 2016}}</ref>  It is often called \"valley within a valley\" as it lies between the two arms of the northern [[Massanutten Mountain]] range in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], which are part of the  in the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]].  The eastern ridgeline of Fort Valley is named Massanutten Mountain and is basically continuous for the eastern length of Fort Valley.  The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the Massanutten range, is composed of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain, which has a smaller valley called Little Fort Valley between it and the western ridgelines. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains and promontories within Forth Valley.

Fort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point called Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the entire valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountains in the south and flowing north, aided by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. 

Fort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. 

==Roads and Gaps==

Between Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the Woodstock Tower, which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain offering panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley. Woodstock Tower is a historic observation post built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. 

Between Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley on the east, over Massanutten Mountain, from Camp Roosevelt to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.

Roads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over [[Powell Mountain]].

'''''Lady in Cement''''' is a 1968 [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[neo-noir]]<ref>[[Alain Silver|Silver, Alain]]; Ward, Elizabeth; eds. (1992). ''Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style'' (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: [[The Overlook Press]]. {{ISBN|0-87951-479-5}}</ref> [[detective film]], directed by [[Gordon Douglas (director)|Gordon Douglas]] and starring [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Raquel Welch]], [[Dan Blocker]], [[Martin Gabel]] and [[Richard Conte]].

A sequel to the 1967 film ''[[Tony Rome]]'', and based on the novel by [[Marvin H. Albert]], ''Lady in Cement'' was released on November 20, 1968.

==Plot==
While diving off the Miami coast seeking one of the eleven fabled Spanish Galleons sunk in 1591, private investigator Tony Rome ([[Frank Sinatra]]) discovers a dead woman, her [[Cement shoes|feet encased in cement]], at the bottom of the ocean.

Rome reports this to Lieutenant Dave Santini ([[Richard Conte]]) and thinks nothing more of the incident, until Waldo Gronski ([[Dan Blocker]]) hires him to find a missing woman, Sandra Lomax. Gronski has little in the way of affluence, so he allows Rome to pawn his watch to retain his services.

After investigating the local hotspots and picking up on a few names, Rome soon comes across Kit Forrester ([[Raquel Welch]]), whose party Sandra Lomax was supposed to have attended. Rome's talking to Forrester raises the ire of racketeer Al Mungar ([[Martin Gabel]]), a supposedly reformed gangster who looks after Kit's interests.

Thinking there may be a connection between Lomax, Forrester and Mungar, Rome starts probing into their backgrounds and begins a romantic relationship with Kit. With both cops and crooks chasing him and the omnipresent Gronski breathing down his neck, Rome finds himself deep in a case which provides few answers.

Filming started in March 1968. Before and during filming, Sinatra would perform at the Fontainebleau in Miami over a six-week period.

==Reception==
===Box office===
According to Fox records the film required $7,150,000 in rentals to break even and by 11 December 1970 had made $6,825,000 so made a loss to the studio.<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/foxthatgotawayt00silv/page/327 327]|title=The Fox that got away : the last days of the Zanuck dynasty at Twentieth Century-Fox|url=https://archive.org/details/foxthatgotawayt00silv|url-access=registration|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M|year=1988|publisher=L. Stuart}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
Opening to mixed reviews, ''Lady in Cement'' is generally considered to be a middling sequel to ''Tony Rome''. Critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two stars, but singled out Sinatra fopr praise in an otherwise poor review, commenting: “In the movie's few good scenes, Sinatra once again painfully reminds us what a controlled, effective actor he is.” [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] noted that “Dan Blocker is excellent as a sympathetic heavy,” whilst John Maloney liked the “fresher script” and “sharp direction.”

==Home media==
''Lady on Cement'' was released on DVD on May 24, 2005 as part of a boxed set along with ''[[Tony Rome]]'' and ''[[The Detective (1968 film)|The Detective]]'', both also directed by Douglas. No bonus features were included.

Filming started in March 1968. Before and during filming, Sinatra would perform at the Fontainebleau in Miami over a six-week period. Welch would go to watch him and found the experience so inspiring she determined to continue to perform to live audiences in her career.<ref>By, G. C. (1982, May 30).

===Critical reception===
Opening to mixed reviews, ''Lady in Cement'' is generally considered to be a middling sequel to ''Tony Rome''. Critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave [[Damn with faint praise|faint praise]] in a generally scathing review by commenting: “In the movie's few good scenes, Sinatra once again painfully reminds us what a controlled, effective actor he is.” [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] noted that “Dan Blocker is excellent as a sympathetic heavy,” whilst John Maloney liked the “fresher script” and “sharp direction.”

==Home media==
''Lady on Cement'' was released on DVD on May 24, 2005 as part of a boxed set along with ''[[Tony Rome]]'' and ''[[The Detective (1968 film)|The Detective]]'', both also directed by Douglas. No bonus features were included.

''Me, Myself & I'' received mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]] who found it to be of less quality compared to ''[[All or Nothing (Fat Joe album)|All or Nothing]]''. [[AllMusic]]'s David Jeffries praised the album for toning down on featured artists to focus more on Joe's deep street lyricism backed by ear-grabbing production, concluding that \"hearing this high-profile thug so boldly reclaiming his street cred without any concessions is exciting and makes it easy to shrug off this driven full-length's one-track mind.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Soren Baker of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the album for balancing out the street bangers with contemplative tracks like \"Bendicion Mami\" and \"Story to Tell\", saying that it makes \"Joe's latest a well-rounded affair.\"<ref name=\"LATimes\"/> Andrew Kameka of ''[[HipHopDX]]'' found some of the lyrical content wearing thin but praised Joe for sticking with his gut of performing gruff street tracks with aggressive production, saying that \"Fat Joe doesn't hold his weight on a few of the album's songs, but he delivers enough strength to silence anyone who questions his place in Hip Hop.<ref name=\"HHDX\"/>

Steve 'Flash' Juon of ''RapReviews'' found the lyrical content to be samey because of Joe's lack of energy and that they were more suited for [[Rick Ross]] and [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], concluding with, \"That personality is completely absent from ''Me, Myself & I'', which may make this the most ironically titled album of his career.\"<ref name=\"RR\"/> [[Jody Rosen]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said that despite two Lil Wayne collaborations, the album suffers from generic brag raps and southern production that are more slave to trends than imaginative, concluding with, \"If only Joe’s CD had less of he, himself, and him.\"<ref name=\"EW\"/> Evan McGarvey of [[Stylus Magazine]] criticized the album for showcasing Joe's worst tendencies of borrowing regional hip hop beats and delivering sex and street lyrics that sound more humorous, concluding with \"Don’t buy it. He’ll be back next year saying the same thing, synth-de-jour in tow.\"<ref name=\"Stylus\"/>

''Gynostemma pentaphyllum'' is known as ''Jiaogulan'' ({{zh|c=[[wiktionary:绞|绞]][[wiktionary:股|股]][[wiktionary:蓝|蓝]]}} in China. The plant was first described in 1406 CE by [[Zhu Xiao]], who presented a description and sketch in the book ''Materia Medica for Famine'' as a [[survival food]] rather than a medicinal herb.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cheng JG, etal |title=Investigation of the plant jiaogulan and its analogous herb, Wulianmei |journal=Zhong Cao Yao |year=1990 |volume=21|issue=9|pages=424}}</ref> The earliest record of jiaogulan's use as a drug comes from herbalist [[Li Shizhen]]'s book ''[[Compendium of Materia Medica]]'' published in 1578, identifying jiaogulan for treating various ailments such as [[hematuria]], [[edema]] in the pharynx and neck, [[Neoplasm|tumors]], and [[Major trauma|trauma]]. While Li Shizhen had confused jiaogulan with an analogous herb [[Wulianmei]], in 1848 [[Wu Qi-Jun]] rectified this confusion in ''Textual Investigation of Herbal Plants''.

Modern recognition of the plant outside of China originated from research in [[sugar substitute]]s.<ref name=drugs/> In the 1970s, while analyzing the sweet component of the jiaogulan plant (known as ''amachazuru'' in Japan), [[Masahiro Nagai]] discovered [[saponin]]s identical to those in ''Panax ginseng''.<ref>{{cite conference |url= |title=Abstracts of Papers, 23d Meeting of the Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy |last1=Nagai |first1=Masahiro |date=November 1976 |publisher=Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy |pages=37 |location= |id= }}</ref> Continued research has described several more saponins ([[gypenoside]]s) comparable or identical to those found in ginseng.<ref name=\"drugs\" /> ''Panax ginseng'' contains [[ginsenoside]]s while [[gypenoside]] saponins have been found in jiaogulan.<ref name=\"drugs\" />

==Distribution and habitat==
''G. pentaphyllum'' is one of about 17 species in the genus ''Gynostemma'', including nine species [[endemic]] to China.<ref name=FoC-genus/> However, ''G. pentaphyllum'' has a wide distribution outside of China, ranging from India and Bangladesh to Southeast Asia to Japan and Korea as well as to New Guinea.<ref name=FoC-species/> In China, it grows in forests, thickets, and roadsides on mountain slopes at elevations of {{convert|300|–|3200|m|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]].<ref name=FoC-species/>

'''Fort Valley''' is a [[mountain]] [[valley]] in [[Shenandoah County, Virginia|Shenandoah County]], [[Virginia]].<ref name=GNIS>{{cite GNIS|1483500|Fort Valley|December 12, 2016}}</ref>  It is often called \"valley within a valley\" as it lies between the two arms of the northern [[Massanutten Mountain]] range in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], which are part of the  in the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]].  The eastern ridgeline of Fort Valley is named Massanutten Mountain and is basically continuous for the eastern length of Fort Valley.  The western ridgeline of the valley is composed of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain, which has a smaller valley called Little Fort Valley between it and the western ridgelines. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains and promontories within Forth Valley.

Fort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point called Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the entire valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountains in the south and flowing north, aided by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. 

Fort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. 

==Roads and Gaps==

Between Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the Woodstock Tower, which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain offering panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley. Woodstock Tower is a historic observation post built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. 

Between Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley on the east, over Massanutten Mountain, from Camp Roosevelt to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.

Roads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over [[Powell Mountain]].

==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==

The [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above Shenandoah State Park on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. 

The [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.

Fort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)

==History==
According to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley from the north, at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible last stand against the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. The [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] made Washington's plans unnecessary.

[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 – 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.

Signal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley that offers sweeping and unobstructed panoramic views of of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as a strategic military observation post. The observation post can view the nearby Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook. It's accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace.

The [[Daniel Munch House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>

Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley on the east, over Massanutten Mountain, from Camp Roosevelt to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.

Roads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over [[Powell Mountain]].

==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==

The [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above Shenandoah State Park on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. 

The [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.

Fort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)

==History==
According to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley from the north, at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible last stand against the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. The [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] made Washington's plans unnecessary.

[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 – 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.

Signal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley that offers sweeping and unobstructed panoramic views of of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as a strategic military observation post. The observation post can view the nearby Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook. It's accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace.

The [[Daniel Munch House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>

'''Fort Valley''' is a [[mountain]] [[valley]] in [[Shenandoah County, Virginia|Shenandoah County]], [[Virginia]].<ref name=GNIS>{{cite GNIS|1483500|Fort Valley|December 12, 2016}}</ref>  It is often called \"valley within a valley\" as it lies between the two arms of the northern [[Massanutten Mountain]] range in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], part of the  in the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]].  The eastern ridgeline of the valley is named Massanuten and is basicallyt continuous for the eastern length of Fort Valley.  The western ridgeline of the valley is composed of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain, which has a smaller valley called Little Fort Valley between it and the western ridgelines. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains and promontories within Forth Valley.

Fort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point called Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the entire valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountains in the south and flowing north, aided by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. 

Fort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. 

==Roads and Gaps==

Between Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the Woodstock Tower, which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain offering panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley. Woodstock Tower is a historic observation post built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. 

Between Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley.

== Biography ==

As a songwriter, Johnson co-wrote the international hit single “[[Just Feel Better]]” with Jamie Houston and [[Damon Johnson]] for [[Carlos Santana]] on his 2005 album ''[[All That I Am (Santana album)|All That I Am]]'', featuring [[Steven Tyler]] on lead vocals.<ref name=\":0\" />

In 2014, Johnson was asked to join [[Aerosmith]] on their European and North American tours on keyboard, acoustic guitarist and backing vocals. Of Johnson's inclusion into the band, [[Steven Tyler]] commented, \"Buck Johnson came in out of the blue and purely by chance to our Aerosmith family, and we feel we really won the lottery. ''Big''. Turns out he's much, much more than just a guy to sing harmony with. He plays slammin' guitar and is out of this world on anything keys. He's a true all-around talent, a huge asset to me and Aerosmith and also a great human being and friend.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/06/aerosmith.html|title=Aerosmith's secret weapon: Alabama native on tour with rock legends|work=AL.com|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/aerosmith-still-living-edge-at-722556|title=Aerosmith Still Living on the Edge at the Forum: Concert Review|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en}}</ref>

==Works==

=== Fable ===
Anselmo is best known for his musical ''Fable'', co-written with his childhood friend, Harrison Kaufman. Originally written by Anselmo after his high school graduation as a song cycle, he brought Kaufman on to write a script, which would help to transform the collection of songs into a full-length musical.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Musical Co-Authored by PHS Alum Selected by Musical Theater Festival {{!}} Town Topics|url = http://www.towntopics.com/wordpress/2014/04/16/musical-co-authored-by-phs-alum-selected-by-musical-theater-festival/|website = www.towntopics.com|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}</ref> The pair developed the material at [[French Woods Festival of the Performing Arts]] and workshopped the show for two years with organizations such as Arts Alliance at Northwestern and the Actors Training Center in [[Wilmette, IL]] before submitting it to the [[New York Musical Theatre Festival]] (more colloquially known as NYMF). Out of hundreds of submissions, ''Fable'' was among ten shows selected for NYMF's Next Link Project,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Q&A: Christopher Anselmo, co-creator of ‘Fable’|url = http://dailynorthwestern.com/2014/04/23/thecurrent/qa-christopher-anselmo-co-creator-of-fable/|website = The Daily Northwestern|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}</ref> and was granted a fully staged production Off-Broadway at the 2014 edition of the festival.

''Fable'' ran at the Pershing Square Signature Center from July 22–27, 2014; the show's run was extended twice.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Both Cloned! and Fable Extend at NYMF in First Week|url = http://www.playbill.com/news/article/both-cloned-and-fable-extend-at-nymf-in-first-week-324342|website = Playbill|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = NYMF's FABLE Extends Again; Comes to 54 Below, 7/17|url = http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/NYMFs-FABLE-Extends-Again-Comes-to-54-Below-717-20140714|website = BroadwayWorld.com|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}</ref> Anselmo's score was widely lauded by critics as \"clever and oddly endearing,\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = NYMF Review: Fable - StageBuddy.com|url = http://stagebuddy.com/reviews/nymf-review-fable|website = StageBuddy.com|accessdate = 2015-12-10|language = en-US}}</ref> \"tuneful [and] insightful,\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Review: Fable {{!}} Times Square Chronicles|url = http://t2conline.com/nymf-fable-or-rent-the-connecticut-years/|website = Times Square Chronicles|accessdate = 2015-12-10|language = en-US|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150827010240/http://t2conline.com/nymf-fable-or-rent-the-connecticut-years/|archivedate = 2015-08-27}}</ref> and \"by turns soaring, jaunty, and hard-rocking.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Reviews - 2014 New York Musical Theater Festival (NYMF) - Part 4|url = http://www.chriscaggiano.com/2014/07/reviews-2014-new-york-musical-theater-festival-part-4.html|website = Everything I Know I Learned From Musicals|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}</ref>

=== The Haunted Train ===
Commissioned by Unmasked Theater Company, Anselmo wrote music and lyrics for the world premiere production of ''The Haunted Train'' (book by Christian Fleming and Randy Gross).

The show was produced Off-Off-Broadway at Theater for the New City from October 14–18, 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Unmasked Theatre to Stage THE HAUNTED TRAIN at TNC This October|url = http://www.broadwayworld.com/off-off-broadway/article/Unmasked-Theatre-to-Stage-THE-HAUNTED-TRAIN-at-TNC-This-October-20150925|website = BroadwayWorld.com|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}</ref> Nickolaus Hines of OnstageBlog wrote that Anselmo's score is \"A warm wave of perfect harmony\" which is \"critical to the piece.... it almost comes off as a set of musical numbers interrupted by lines.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Review: \"The Haunted Train\" at Theater for the New City|url = http://www.onstageblog.com/reviews/2015/10/21/review-the-haunted-train-at-theater-for-the-new-city|website = OnStage|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}</ref>

==Involvement at Northwestern==
Anselmo frequently participates in multiple roles within Northwestern's theatrical and musical community. As a director, he has helmed established musicals, like ''[[Spamalot]]'', while also developing new works, like ''Fight or Flight'' (a song cycle).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Q&A: The Daily speaks with ‘Spamalot’ director about gender changes in the musical|url = http://dailynorthwestern.com/2015/11/11/ae/qa-the-daily-speaks-with-spamalot-director-about-gender-changes-in-the-musical/|website = The Daily Northwestern|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Songs of Themselves: Reviewing ‘The Lilliput Troupe’ and ‘Fight or Flight’|url = http://dailynorthwestern.com/2014/04/30/thecurrent/songs-of-themselves-reviewing-the-lilliput-troupe-and-fight-or-flight/|website = The Daily Northwestern|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}</ref> He has also contributed to Northwestern's [[a cappella]] community, performing and arranging (and formerly serving as musical director) with Freshman Fifteen, an all-male a cappella group.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Freshman Fifteen|url = http://www.nufreshman15.com|website = www.nufreshman15.com|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}</ref>

==Early life==

Dharmacharya was born at [[Chyasal|Chikan Bahi]], [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur District]] to father Vaidya Vrishman Vandya and mother Muni Thakun Vandya. He studied at [[Durbar High School]] in [[Kathmandu]] and did his matriculation from [[Kolkata]] and enrolled at the [[University of Calcutta]] for higher studies.

==Buddhist activist==

On his visits to Kathmandu during the holidays, he organized Buddhist programs and exhibitions of religious pictures he had collected in Kolkata. In 1924, he established the Buddha Dharma Support Association at the home of [[Dharma Man Tuladhar]]. He encouraged its members to read Buddhist books and translated articles in English and [[Pali]] into Nepal Bhasa.

Upon his return to Kolkata, he established the Nepalese Buddhist Association to help Nepalese traders who had fallen into difficulty besides teaching them Buddhist principles. In 1928, he helped organize the All India Buddhist Conference.<ref>{{cite news|title=From Editorial Desk|url=http://www.niem.com.np/buddhisthim/backissues/vol9_no12/editorial10.htm|accessdate=7 February 2012|newspaper=Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods|date=1997}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In an effort to promote Buddhism among the Nepalese in [[Darjeeling]], he brought out ''Himalaya Bauddha'' in the [[Nepali language]] and ''Buddhist India'' in English in 1927 which he and B. M.

Dharmacharya returned to Kathmandu with a master's degree in Pali. He joined the Industry Council as an administrative officer and married Asta Maya and settled down into the life of a householder.

==Imprisonment==

In 1940, Dharmacharya was arrested in a crackdown against democracy activists, writers and social reformers. He was jailed for three months with other Nepal Bhasa writers.

==History==
[[File:klenater.jpg|thumb|right|A handmade Danish ''klejner'', a traditional cruller shape, rectangular with two twisted sides]]

The name comes from early 19th century Dutch ''kruller'', from ''krullen'' 'to curl'. In northern Germany they are known as ''hirschhörner'' (deer horns). They are traditionally baked on [[New Year's Eve]] as a family project with the kids doing the labor-intensive shaping and the grown ups handling the deep frying.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In Danish they are known as ''[[klejner]]'' and in Swedish as ''[[klenäter]]'', both names deriving from Low German. In Scandinavia crullers are common at Christmas. In the US various shapes of pastries are known as crullers.  Some forms of those crullers are what is traditionally eaten in Germany and some other European countries on [[Shrove Tuesday]], to use up fat before Lent.

The term \"Chinese cruller\" is occasionally applied to the [[youtiao]] ({{zh|s=油条}}), a similar-looking fried dough food eaten in East and Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"Midwestern Crullers\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thespruce.com/traditional-chinese-breakfast-694158|title=If You Want a New Breakfast Idea, Then Go Chinese!|publisher=The Spruce|author=Rhonda Parkinson|date=May 3, 2017|accessdate=24 June 2017}}</ref> The term cruller is also associated with the mahua ({{zh|s=麻花}}).<ref>\"crullers\". Youdao dictionary. Accessed August 1, 2013.</ref> Mahua is a type of twisted fried dough much denser and sweeter than youtiao.

The \"Aberdeen crulla\" is a traditional Scottish pastry made in the same way as the rectangular, plaited cruller of New England.<ref>F. Marian McNiell, \"The Scots Kitchen\",</ref> It is first attested in [[Edinburgh]] in 1829 and is thought to copied from the 'cruller' of the United States according to the Scottish National Dictionary (1931–1976).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/crulla |title=Crulla ''n.'' |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2004 |website=Dictionary of the Scots Language –  Dictionar o the Scots Leid |publisher=Scottish Language Dictionaries Ltd. |access-date=15 November 2018}}</ref> Distinct from this, the \"yum-yum\" is a commonly available treat in Scotland, which resembles a straightened French cruller coated in thin glacé icing.

In 1909 a US author published her belief that crullers were invented in the New World in 1617 by [[Sebastian Croll]], due to the perceived similarity of the names according to her.<ref name=\"historyhudson\">{{Cite book|last=Bradbury|first=Mrs. Anna R.|title=History of the city of Hudson, New York : with biographical sketches of Henry Hudson and Robert Fulton|year=1909|publisher=Record Print. and Pub.

Dorothy in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' sings \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" early in the movie holding what's left of a cruller [[Aunt Em]] had offered to her after giving them to Hunk, Hickory, and Zeke, her \"three shiftless farmhands\".  The twisted shape of the cruller might have been a metaphor for tornadoes as the same scene references other metaphors which influenced Dorothy's subsequent dream.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Crullers are most commonly found in Canada, [[New England]], the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] and North Central states of the United States, but are also common in California.

The '''Porcupine Mountains''', or '''Porkies''', are a group of small mountains spanning the northwestern [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]] in [[Ontonagon County, Michigan|Ontonagon]] and [[Gogebic County, Michigan|Gogebic]] counties, near the shore of [[Lake Superior]]. The Porcupine Mountains were named by the native [[Ojibwa]] people, supposedly because their silhouette had the shape of a crouching [[porcupine]].<ref name=vogel/> They are home to the most extensive stand of [[old growth]] [[northern hardwood]] forest in North America west of the [[Adirondack Mountains]], spanning at least {{convert|31000|acre|ha}}. The area is popular among tourists, especially [[Lake of the Clouds]] in the heart of the mountains, and is part of '''Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park'''.<ref name=mdnr/>  

The Porcupine Mountains were the site of [[copper]] mining in the 19th century. One of these mines is the [[Nonesuch Mine]], which operated sporadically from 1867 to 1912. Because of its copper mining history, the [[state park]] is a cooperating unit of [[Keweenaw National Historical Park]].

==Geology==
The most striking geological feature of the Porcupine Mountains is the long [[basalt]] and [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] [[escarpment]] parallel to the Lake Superior shore and overlooking Lake of the Clouds, a continuation of the same copper-bearing bedrock found farther northeast on the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]].<ref name=mdnr2/> A second ridge farther inland, on the other side of Lake of the Clouds, includes Summit Peak, the highest point in the mountains at 1,958 feet (595 m).<ref name=summit/> Rivers, waterfalls, swamps, and lakes lie between the rocky outcroppings. There are a number of waterfalls on the [[Presque Isle River]] in the extreme western side of the park.

==Meteorology==
The mountains are subject to heavy [[lake-effect snow]] from [[Lake Superior]]. The relatively high elevation of the mountains and their proximity to the lake provide perfect conditions for lake-effect snow, but no official records are maintained anywhere in the mountains. The closest National Weather Service station is in the coastal community of Ontonagon, where the annual average is about {{convert|200|in|cm}}. Totals of well over {{convert|250|in|cm}} annually are likely in the higher elevations. It is not uncommon to have {{convert|300|in|cm|adj=on}} seasons in this region.

==Flora and fauna==
The Porkies are the location of a large stand of [[old growth forest]]. In these virgin forests, [[sugar maple]], [[American basswood]], [[eastern hemlock]], and [[yellow birch]] are the most abundant tree species.<ref name=\"OldGrowthEastUS\"/> 

Area fauna includes [[moose]], [[gray wolves]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[coyotes]], [[gray fox|gray]] and [[red fox]]es, [[cougar]], river [[otters]], [[beaver]], [[fisher (animal)|fisher]], [[marten]], [[mink]], [[bobcats]], [[lynx]], [[American black bear|black bears]], and [[porcupines]]. There have been numerous bear sightings. 

Endangered, threatened and special concern species found in the Porkies include small blue-eyed mary, ram's head ladyslipper, Hooker's fairy-bells, slender cliff brake, male fern, gray wolf, wood turtle, peregrine falcon, merlin, and bald eagle.<ref name=mdnr2/> 

==State park==
Porcupine Mountains State Park was established in 1945 to protect the area's large stand of old-growth forest, much of it of the \"maple-hemlock\" type. In 1972, Michigan passed the Wilderness and Natural Areas Act. This act gave the park the new designation of the Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park. Facilities provided by the park include an extensive network of backcountry trails for hiking and wilderness backpacking, rustic trailside cabins, modern campgrounds, swimming and boating areas, and various interpretive programs led by [[park ranger]]s. The [[North Country Trail]] passes through the park, making up a portion of the {{convert|87|mi|km}} of hiking trails. A ski area operates within the park in winter.<ref name=mdnr/>

They are manufactured by German rolling stock manufacturer [[Siemens Mobility|Siemens]], mainly for services from [[Moorgate railway station|Moorgate]] station, in London. A total of 25 six-car units are to be built. Starting in January 2019, limited preview services began<ref name=railserviceentry/> and the phase-in of regular service began in March 2019.<ref name=fullserviceentry>{{cite web |url=https://www.railmagazine.com/news/network/great-northern-class-717s-finally-enter-passenger-service |title=Great Northern Class 717s finally enter passenger service}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.greatnorthernrail.com/717trains|title=New Trains for Moorgate services|publisher=Great Northern|accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref>

==History==
Upon winning the [[Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise]], [[Govia Thameslink Railway]] (GTR) announced that it would seek to replace the existing {{BRC|313}} units (which were 40 years old in 2016) operating on services to and from Moorgate, with up to 25 six-car units intended to be procured.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thameslink Franchise operator announced|url=http://www.rail.co.uk/rail-news/2014/thameslink-franchise-operator-announced/|website=rail.co.uk|publisher=rail.co.uk|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref> In December 2015, GTR announced that it had selected Siemens to provide this new fleet as a follow-on order from the main [[British Rail Class 700|Class 700]] order, with entry into service expected from March 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Siemens selected to supply Moorgate suburban EMU fleet|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/traction-rolling-stock/single-view/view/siemens-selected-to-supply-moorgate-suburban-emu-fleet.html|website=Railway Gazette|publisher=Railway Gazette|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref>
The order was finalised in February 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=GTR strikes £200m-plus deal for new train fleet serving City of London|url=https://www.siemens.co.uk/en/news_press/index/news_archive/2016/gtr-strikes-200m-plus-deal-for-new-train-fleet-serving-city-of-london.htm|website=Siemens UK|publisher=Siemens UK|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.markprisk.com/sites/www.markprisk.com/files/2017-12/GTR%20response%20to%20meeting%20with%20Mark%20Prisk%20MP.pdf |title=:Letter from GTR to MP Mark Prisk}}</ref>

A significant difference between Class 717s and the earlier Class 700s is the provision of fold-down emergency doors at both ends of each train. These are required for emergency evacuation of passengers<ref name=\"rail_jun_16\"/> while inside the [[Northern City Line|Moorgate tunnels]].<ref name=\"SexAp\">{{cite book |author=Network Rail |authorlink=Network Rail |title=London North Eastern Route Sectional Appendix LOR 105 Seq 001|volume=Module LNE1 |date=2017-06-03 |id=NR30018/02 |page=41}}</ref>

Siemens began testing the Class 717 units in Germany during June 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.railwaymagazine.co.uk/testing-begins-on-gtrs-new-class-717s-in-germany/ |title=Testing begins on GTR’s new Class 717s in Germany}}</ref> The first unit operated a single preview service in late September 2018, with gradual introduction from the spring of 2019.<ref name=railserviceentry>{{cite web|url=https://www.railmagazine.com/news/network/new-great-northern-class-717-carries-first-passengers |title=New Great Northern Class 717 carries first passengers}}</ref>

They are manufactured by German rolling stock manufacturer [[Siemens Mobility|Siemens]], mainly for services from [[Moorgate railway station|Moorgate]] station, in London. A total of 25 six-car units are to be built. Starting in January 2019, limited preview services began<ref name=railserviceentry/> and the phase-in of regular service began in March 2019.<ref name=fullserviceentry>{{cite web |url=https://www.railmagazine.com/news/network/great-northern-class-717s-finally-enter-passenger-service |title=Great Northern Class 717s finally enter passenger service}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.greatnorthernrail.com/717trains|title=New Trains for Moorgate services|publisher=Great Northern|accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref>

==History==
Upon winning the [[Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise]], [[Govia Thameslink Railway]] (GTR) announced that it would seek to replace the existing {{BRC|313}} units (which were 40 years old in 2016) operating on services to and from Moorgate, with up to 25 six-car units intended to be procured.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thameslink Franchise operator announced|url=http://www.rail.co.uk/rail-news/2014/thameslink-franchise-operator-announced/|website=rail.co.uk|publisher=rail.co.uk|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref> In December 2015, GTR announced that it had selected Siemens to provide this new fleet as a follow-on order from the main [[British Rail Class 700|Class 700]] order, with entry into service expected from March 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Siemens selected to supply Moorgate suburban EMU fleet|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/traction-rolling-stock/single-view/view/siemens-selected-to-supply-moorgate-suburban-emu-fleet.html|website=Railway Gazette|publisher=Railway Gazette|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref>
The order was finalised in February 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=GTR strikes £200m-plus deal for new train fleet serving City of London|url=https://www.siemens.co.uk/en/news_press/index/news_archive/2016/gtr-strikes-200m-plus-deal-for-new-train-fleet-serving-city-of-london.htm|website=Siemens UK|publisher=Siemens UK|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.markprisk.com/sites/www.markprisk.com/files/2017-12/GTR%20response%20to%20meeting%20with%20Mark%20Prisk%20MP.pdf |title=:Letter from GTR to MP Mark Prisk}}</ref>

A significant difference between Class 717s and the earlier Class 700s is the provision of fold-down emergency doors at both ends of each train. These are required for emergency evacuation of passengers<ref name=\"rail_jun_16\"/> while inside the [[Northern City Line|Moorgate tunnels]].<ref name=\"SexAp\">{{cite book |author=Network Rail |authorlink=Network Rail |title=London North Eastern Route Sectional Appendix LOR 105 Seq 001|volume=Module LNE1 |date=2017-06-03 |id=NR30018/02 |page=41}}</ref>

Siemens began testing the Class 717 units in Germany during June 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.railwaymagazine.co.uk/testing-begins-on-gtrs-new-class-717s-in-germany/ |title=Testing begins on GTR’s new Class 717s in Germany}}</ref> The first unit operated a single preview service in late September 2018, with gradual introduction from the spring of 2019.<ref name=railserviceentry>{{cite web|url=https://www.railmagazine.com/news/network/new-great-northern-class-717-carries-first-passengers |title=New Great Northern Class 717 carries first passengers}}</ref>

cat,safe,Unoquha,"'''Dorothy Bulstrode''' (1592-1650), Courtier to [[Anne of Denmark]].

Dorothy Bulstrode, or Boulstred, was a lady in waiting to Anne of Denmark, and a younger sister of [[Cecily Bulstrode]] the subject of poems by [[Ben Jonson]] and [[John Donne]].

She was the youngest of six daughters of Edward Bulstrode (d. 1598) of [[Hedgerley]], Buckinghamshire, and Cecill Croke who married in London on 28 May 1571 at [[St Dunstan-in-the-West]]. The names of her siblings are recorded on her father's tomb at [[St Laurence's Church, Upton-cum-Chalvey]].<ref>Frederic Madden, ''Collectanea Topographica Et Genealogica'', vol. 5 (London, 1838), p. 213: George Lipscombe, ''The History and Antiquities of the County of Buckingham'', vol. 4 (London, 1847), p. 475.</ref>

Dorothy's eldest sister Elizabeth (1575-1631) married the lawyer [[James Whitelocke]] in 1602. Another sister Anne Bulstrode (d. 1611) married the lawyer John Searle (1569-1622) in 1609. Her grandfather Sir [[John Croke]] died at [[Chilton, Buckinghamshire|Chilton]] in February 1609, leaving in his will £100 \"to my daughter Bulstrode towards the preferment of her daughters unmarried\".<ref>John Bruce, ''Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke'' (Camden Society, London, 1858), pp. 16-18, 25-6: Will of Sir John Croke, TNA PROB11/113/486.</ref>

==Life at court==
Dorothy and her older sister [[Cecily Bulstrode]] (1584-1609) were both gentlewomen in the bedchamber of [[Anne of Denmark]], and associated with the influential courtier [[Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford]]. They had a family connection to Lady Bedford's Harington family through their aunt Cecily Bulstrode who married her grandfather [[Robert Keilway]].

She married in 1609 or 1610, [[John Eyre (died 1639)|Sir John Eyre]] (1580-39), or \"Ayres\" of [[Great Chalfield Manor]], Wiltshire.<ref name=hist>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/member/eyre-sir-john-1580-1639 EYRE, Sir John (1580-1639), of Great Chalfield, Wilts.; later of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, Mdx.] ''[[The History of Parliament]]''. Retrieved 1 December 2017.</ref> After her marriage, Dorothy was known as \"Lady Eyre\" or \"Lady Ayres\". James Whitelocke, recalling the events of 1611, recorded that Eyre and Bulstrode were married without the consent of either family, and wrote, \"the man is one of the most dissolute, unjust, and vicious reprobates that lives upon the face of the earth\".<ref>John Bruce, ''Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke'' (Camden Society, London, 1858), pp. 16-18, 25-6.</ref>

The queen gave presents of clothing to her gentlewomen, and gave Dorothy, \"Lady Eayres\", a gown of ash-colour taffeta on 4 July 1610 and a black satin gown on 14 October 1610.<ref>Jemma Field, [https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/pdfplus/10.3366/cost.2017.0003 'The Wardrobe Goods of Anna of Denmark', ''Costume'', 51:1 (March, 2017), p. 21], & supplement nos. 23, 333, 384.</ref>

In 1611 Eyre attempted to murder [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Sir Edward Herbert]], whom he suspected of having an affair with his wife Dorothy Bulstrode. Herbert, two years earlier, had written an epitaph for Dorothy's sister Cecily. In his autobiography he describes his encounter with \"Sir John Ayres\" in detail. According to Herbert, [[Anne of Denmark]] obtained his portrait by [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]] and Dorothy had it copied in miniature by [[Isaac Oliver]], and she wore it in a gold locket concealed to view.<ref>James Lees-Milne, 'Two Portraits at Charlecote Park by William Larkin', ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 94, No. 597 (Dec., 1952), pp. 352-6.</ref> Herbert wrote, she \"wore it about her neck so low that she hid it under her breasts\". Herbert thought this the cause of Sir John Eyre's jealousy, and although Dorothy was of \"an excellent wit and discourse\", Herbert claimed he knew her only slightly. However, he also described visiting her chamber at the palace and finding her in bed examining the miniature by candlelight.<ref>Patricia Fumerton, 'Secret Arts: Elizabethan Miniatures and Sonnets', in Sephen Greenblatt, ''Representing the Renaissance'' (Berkeley, 1988), p. 124.</ref> Soon, following a summons to court from a \"great lady\", Herbert received warnings from [[Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester]], the Countess of Bedford, and [[Edward Hoby|Elizabeth, Lady Hoby]] another of the queen's gentlewomen, that Sir John Eyre planned to murder him in his bed. Herbert got in touch with Eyre to ask if he would fight a duel, but the answer was unclear.

Eyre and four accomplices caught up with Herbert and his two footmen at [[Great Scotland Yard|Scotland Yard]] as he was leaving [[Whitehall Palace]], and wounded his horse several times. Eyre broke Herbert's sword. Two other men helped Herbert, and after a prolonged struggle Herbert wounded Eyre, who was carried to the [[Thames]] vomiting. A few days later Eyre sent a message that he would kill Herbert with \"a musket out of a window\". Meanwhile, because Eyre publicly claimed Dorothy had confessed to being unfaithful, she sent a letter to her aunt [[John Croke|Lady Croke]] denying this, and Herbert was able to give this letter to the Privy Council. The [[Ludovic Stuart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]] said that John Eyre was \"the most miserable man living\" because of the shame of Dorothy's letter proving him a liar, and because his father had disinherited him on hearing of the assault.<ref>Horace Walpole, ''The life of Edward Lord Herbert, of Cherbury. Written by himself'' (Edinburgh, 1809), pp. 134-149.</ref>

Herbert mentions that during the assault there were spectators of the \"Suffolk faction\" sided with Eyre, the year before Herbert had fought with [[Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk|Lord Walden de Walden]] in Germany.<ref>''HMC 5th Report (C. Griffith)'' (London, 1876), p. 408.</ref> Dorothy was pregnant and Eyre may have believed Herbert was the father of the child. Dorothy's son William Eyre was born in October 1611 at Flambards at [[Cold Norton]], [[Essex]], the house of Dorothy's mother Cecill, now Lady Brown. The child presumably died young, as he was not mentioned in Eyre's will.<ref>John Bruce, ''Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke'' (Camden Society, London, 1858), pp. 25-6.</ref>

James Whitelocke described the christening of his own son James in May 1612. One godparent was [[Humphrey May]] (1573-1630), groom of the king's privy chamber, Whitelocke wrote he \"should have been for Dorothy\", apparently meaning he would have preferred him as a brother-in-law rather than the \"reprobate\" Eyre. May had been Whitelocke's friend at [[St John's College, Oxford]] and in chambers at the [[Inns of Court]].<ref>John Bruce, ''Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke'' (Camden Society, London, 1858), pp. 21, 26, 61.</ref>

Eyre died in comparative poverty in 1639, leaving just 5 shillings to his wife.

==Riper Years==
Dorothy Eyre later married John Clyffe (1597-1674). She died in 1650 and was buried at St Mary's, [[Upton Grey]], Hampshire, where she has a marble or alabaster wall monument with her portrait bust and heraldry, and also a further wooden board with verses commemorating her.<ref>[https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol3/pp382-386 'Parishes: Upton Grey', in ''A History of the County of Hampshire'', vol. 3, ed. William Page (London, 1908), pp. 382-386. British History Online].</ref> The monument's inscription was printed in the ''Gentleman's Magazine'' which alludes to her medicinal practices, and that other daughters were \"wise\" but she was \"best\", but the verses were not published, \"not being remarkable for their goodness.\"<ref>'Upton Grey', ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', vol. 66 part 1 (London, 1796), pp. 15-16.</ref> In his will, John Clyffe wished to buried close to his wife \"Lady Eyres\", and he is commemorated by a [[ledger stone]] in the church.

[[Category:Dueling]]","'''Dorothy Bulstrode''' (1592-1650), Courtier to [[Anne of Denmark]].

Dorothy Bulstrode, or Boulstred, was a lady in waiting to Anne of Denmark, and a younger sister of [[Cecily Bulstrode]] the subject of poems by [[Ben Jonson]] and [[John Donne]].

She was the youngest of six daughters of Edward Bulstrode (d. 1598) of [[Hedgerley]], Buckinghamshire, and Cecill Croke who married in London on 28 May 1571 at [[St Dunstan-in-the-West]]. The names of her siblings are recorded on her father's tomb at [[St Laurence's Church, Upton-cum-Chalvey]].<ref>Frederic Madden, ''Collectanea Topographica Et Genealogica'', vol. 5 (London, 1838), p. 213: George Lipscombe, ''The History and Antiquities of the County of Buckingham'', vol. 4 (London, 1847), p. 475.</ref>

Dorothy's eldest sister Elizabeth (1575-1631) married the lawyer [[James Whitelocke]] in 1602. Another sister Anne Bulstrode (d. 1611) married the lawyer John Searle (1569-1622) in 1609. Her grandfather Sir [[John Croke]] died at [[Chilton, Buckinghamshire|Chilton]] in February 1609, leaving in his will £100 \"to my daughter Bulstrode towards the preferment of her daughters unmarried\".<ref>John Bruce, ''Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke'' (Camden Society, London, 1858), pp. 16-18, 25-6: Will of Sir John Croke, TNA PROB11/113/486.</ref>

==Life at court==
Dorothy and her older sister [[Cecily Bulstrode]] (1584-1609) were both gentlewomen in the bedchamber of [[Anne of Denmark]], and associated with the influential courtier [[Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford]]. They had a family connection to Lady Bedford's Harington family through their aunt Cecily Bulstrode who married her grandfather [[Robert Keilway]].

She married in 1609 or 1610, [[John Eyre (died 1639)|Sir John Eyre]] (1580-39), or \"Ayres\" of [[Great Chalfield Manor]], Wiltshire.<ref name=hist>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/member/eyre-sir-john-1580-1639 EYRE, Sir John (1580-1639), of Great Chalfield, Wilts.; later of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, Mdx.] ''[[The History of Parliament]]''. Retrieved 1 December 2017.</ref> After her marriage, Dorothy was known as \"Lady Eyre\" or \"Lady Ayres\". James Whitelocke, recalling the events of 1611, recorded that Eyre and Bulstrode were married without the consent of either family, and wrote, \"the man is one of the most dissolute, unjust, and vicious reprobates that lives upon the face of the earth\".<ref>John Bruce, ''Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke'' (Camden Society, London, 1858), pp. 16-18, 25-6.</ref>

The queen gave presents of clothing to her gentlewomen, and gave Dorothy, \"Lady Eayres\", a gown of ash-colour taffeta on 4 July 1610 and a black satin gown on 14 October 1610.<ref>Jemma Field, [https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/pdfplus/10.3366/cost.2017.0003 'The Wardrobe Goods of Anna of Denmark', ''Costume'', 51:1 (March, 2017), p. 21], & supplement nos. 23, 333, 384.</ref>

In 1611 Eyre attempted to murder [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Sir Edward Herbert]], whom he suspected of having an affair with his wife Dorothy Bulstrode. Herbert, two years earlier, had written an epitaph for Dorothy's sister Cecily. In his autobiography he describes his encounter with \"Sir John Ayres\" in detail. According to Herbert, [[Anne of Denmark]] obtained his portrait by [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]] and Dorothy had it copied in miniature by [[Isaac Oliver]], and she wore it in a gold locket concealed to view.<ref>James Lees-Milne, 'Two Portraits at Charlecote Park by William Larkin', ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 94, No. 597 (Dec., 1952), pp. 352-6.</ref> Herbert wrote, she \"wore it about her neck so low that she hid it under her breasts\". Herbert thought this the cause of Sir John Eyre's jealousy, and although Dorothy was of \"an excellent wit and discourse\", Herbert claimed he knew her only slightly. However, he also described visiting her chamber at the palace and finding her in bed examining the miniature by candlelight.<ref>Patricia Fumerton, 'Secret Arts: Elizabethan Miniatures and Sonnets', in Sephen Greenblatt, ''Representing the Renaissance'' (Berkeley, 1988), p. 124.</ref> Soon, following a summons to court from a \"great lady\", Herbert received warnings from [[Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester]], the Countess of Bedford, and [[Edward Hoby|Elizabeth, Lady Hoby]] another of the queen's gentlewomen, that Sir John Eyre planned to murder him in his bed. Herbert got in touch with Eyre to ask if he would fight a duel, but the answer was unclear.

Eyre and four accomplices caught up with Herbert and his two footmen at [[Great Scotland Yard|Scotland Yard]] as he was leaving [[Whitehall Palace]], and wounded his horse several times. Eyre broke Herbert's sword. Two other men helped Herbert, and after a prolonged struggle Herbert wounded Eyre, who was carried to the [[Thames]] vomiting. A few days later Eyre sent a message that he would kill Herbert with \"a musket out of a window\". Meanwhile, because Eyre publicly claimed Dorothy had confessed to being unfaithful, she sent a letter to her aunt [[John Croke|Lady Croke]] denying this, and Herbert was able to give this letter to the Privy Council. The [[Ludovic Stuart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]] said that John Eyre was \"the most miserable man living\" because of the shame of Dorothy's letter proving him a liar, and because his father had disinherited him on hearing of the assault.<ref>Horace Walpole, ''The life of Edward Lord Herbert, of Cherbury. Written by himself'' (Edinburgh, 1809), pp. 134-149.</ref>

Herbert mentions that during the assault there were spectators of the \"Suffolk faction\" sided with Eyre, the year before Herbert had fought with [[Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk|Lord Walden de Walden]] in Germany.<ref>''HMC 5th Report (C. Griffith)'' (London, 1876), p. 408.</ref> Dorothy was pregnant and Eyre may have believed Herbert was the father of the child. Dorothy's son William Eyre was born in October 1611 at Flambards at [[Cold Norton]], [[Essex]], the house of Dorothy's mother Cecill, now Lady Brown. The child presumably died young, as he was not mentioned in Eyre's will.<ref>John Bruce, ''Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke'' (Camden Society, London, 1858), pp. 25-6.</ref>

James Whitelocke described the christening of his own son James in May 1612. One godparent was [[Humphrey May]] (1573-1630), groom of the king's privy chamber, Whitelocke wrote he \"should have been for Dorothy\", apparently meaning he would have preferred him as a brother-in-law rather than the \"reprobate\" Eyre. May had been Whitelocke's friend at [[St John's College, Oxford]] and in chambers at the [[Inns of Court]].<ref>John Bruce, ''Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke'' (Camden Society, London, 1858), pp. 21, 26, 61.</ref>

Eyre died in comparative poverty in 1639, leaving just 5 shillings to his wife.

==Riper Years==
Dorothy Eyre later married John Clyffe (1597-1674). She died in 1650 and was buried at St Mary's, [[Upton Grey]], Hampshire, where she has a marble or alabaster wall monument with her portrait bust and heraldry, and also a further wooden board with verses commemorating her.<ref>[https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol3/pp382-386 'Parishes: Upton Grey', in ''A History of the County of Hampshire'', vol. 3, ed. William Page (London, 1908), pp. 382-386. British History Online].</ref> The monument's inscription was printed in the ''Gentleman's Magazine'' which alludes to her medicinal practices, and that other daughters were \"wise\" but she was \"best\", but the verses were not published, \"not being remarkable for their goodness.\"<ref>'Upton Grey', ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', vol. 66 part 1 (London, 1796), pp. 15-16.</ref> In his will, John Clyffe wished to buried close to his wife \"Lady Eyres\", and he is commemorated by a [[ledger stone]] in the church.
