The dynasty provided four [[kings of Germany]] (1024\u20131125), all of whom went on to be crowned [[Holy Roman emperors]] (1027\u20131125).\n\nAfter the death of the last [[Ottonian]] emperor in 1024, the [[Kingdom of Germany]] and later the entire [[Holy Roman Empire]] passed to [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], a Salian. He was followed by three more Salian rulers: [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], and [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]]. They established their monarchy as a major European power. They achieved the development of a permanent administrative system based on a class of public officials answerable to the crown.\n\n==Origins and name==\n\n[[File:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|right|Family tree of the imperial dynasties of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]: Carolingians, Ottonians, Salians and Hohenstaufen.]]\n\nModern historians suppose that the Salians descended from the [[Widonids]], a prominent noble kindred emerging in the 7th&nbsp;century. Their estates were located at the confluence of rivers [[Moselle]] and [[Saar (river)|Saar]] and they supported the [[Carolingians]]. The Widonids' eastward expansion towards the river [[Rhine]] started after they founded [[Hornbach Abbey]] in the [[Bliesgau]] around 750. Hornbach remained their [[proprietary church|proprietary monastery]] and royal grants to the abbey established their presence in the [[Wormsgau]]. As time passed, several branches split off the Widonids. The late 9th-century Holy Roman Emperor [[Guy III of Spoleto|Guy (or Wido) of Spoleto]] descended from one of these branches, the Lambertines. The Salians' forefathers remained in [[Duchy of Franconia|Rhenish Franconia]]. {{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=7\u20139}}\n\n[[Wipo of Burgundy]], the biographer of the first Salian monarch, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Conrad&nbsp;II]], described Conrad's father and uncle as \"distinguished noble lords from Rhenish Franconia\", but without calling them Salians around 1044. Wipo added that Conrad's mother, [[Adelaide of Metz]], \"supposedly descended from the ancient royal house of [[Troy]]\". The statement made a connection between Conrad and the royal [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]] who had claimed a Troyan ancestry for themselves. Historian Stefan Weinfurter proposes that the putative relatinship between the Salians and the Merovingians gave rise to the family name, because the Salian Franks had been the most renowned Frankish group. Their memory was preserved through a Frankish law code, known as [[Salic law]]. A less likely [[etimology]] links the appelation to the old German world ''sal'' (\"lordship\"), proposing that the name can be traced to the Salian monarchs' well-documented inclination towards hierarchical structures.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe term ''reges salici'' (or Salian kings) was most probably coined early in the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=5}} A list of monarchs and archbishop from [[Mainz]], which was completed around 1139\u201340, is the first extant document to contain it. Bishop [[Otto of Freising]], a maternal descendant of the Salian monarchs, also used the term in his ''Chronicle or History of the Two Cities'' in the middle of the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=15}} In a narrow sense, only the four German monarchs who ruled from 1024 to 1125 could be called Salians, but the same appelation have already been expanded to their ancestors by modern historians.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=5}}\n\nAll male members of the family who were destined to a secular career were named [[Conrad (name)|Conrad]] or [[Henry (given name)|Henry]]. Emperor Conrad&nbsp;II's grandfather, [[Otto I, Duke of Carinthia|Otto of Worms]], established this tradition in the late 10th&nbsp;century. He named his eldest son, [[Henry of Speyer|Henry of Worms]], after his maternal great-grandfather, King [[Henry the Fowler]]; and he gave the name of his father, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], to one of his younger sons, [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]].

His family links to the Widonids cannot be securely established, but his patrimonial lands and his close relationship with the Hornbach Abbey provide indirect evidence of his Widonid ancestry. He married a kinswoman, most probably a sister, of King Conrad&nbsp;I of Germany. This marriage alliance with the [[Conradines]] introduced Conrad as a [[leading name]] in his family.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=9}}\n\n===Conrad the Red===\n{{Main|Conrad the Red}}\n\nWerner's son, Conrad the Red, inherited his father Franconian estates. His family links with the Conradines facilitated his acquisition of large portions of their domains after King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&nbsp;I of Germany]] crushed their revolt in 939. The Conradines lost their preeminent position in Franconia and Conrad the Red emerged as Otto&nbsp;I's principal supporter in the region. He was awarded with the [[Duchy of Lotharingia]] in 944 or 945 and he married the King's daughter, [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Luidgard]], in 947. The marriage forged a link between the royal [[Ottonian dynasty]] and the Salians. He lost Lotharingia after he joined a revolt against his father-in-law in 953 or 954. He died fighting against the invading [[Magyars]] in the [[Battle of Lech]] in 955. The contemporaneous [[Widukind of Corvey]] praised him for his bravery. He was buried in the [[Worms Cathedral]], although mainly bishops and kings had so far been buried in cathedrals.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=6, 9}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=18, 361 (note 22)}}\n\n===Otto of Worms===\n{{Main|Otto I, Duke of Carinthia}}\n\nConrad the Red's son, Otto of Worms, founded favour with his maternal granfather, King (from 962 Emperor) Otto&nbsp;I. Still a minor, he was mentioned as a count in the [[Nahegau]] in 956. He also seized Wormsgau, Speyergau, [[Niddagau]], [[Elsenzgau]], [[Kraichgau]] and [[Pfinzgau]], thus uniting almost all lands between the rivers Rhine and [[Neckar]] by the time Otto&nbsp;I deceased in 973. The parentage of his wife, Judith, is uncertain: she may have been related either to [[Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria]], to Count Henry of Arlon, or to [[Burkhard, Margrave of Austria|Burchard, Margrave in the Eastern Marches]]. Otto&nbsp;I's son and successor, Emperor [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&nbsp;II]], was obviously worried aboukt the concentration of lands in his nephew's hands in Franconia. The Emperor appointed Otto of Worms to administer the faraway [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and [[March of Verona]] in 978. The Emperor also persuaded Otto to cede his right to administer justice in Worms and also parts of his revenues in the town to the [[Bishop of Worms|local bishop]]. Otto was persuaded to renounce Carinthia and Verona, but he was lavishly compensated with a large forest in [[Wasgau]], the royal palace at [[Kaiserslautern]] and the properiatery rights over [[Weissenburg Abbey, Alsace|Weissenburg Abbey]]. He could also preserve the title of duke, thus he was the first duke to bear the title without ruling a duchy in Germany. Otto was the cousin of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor]], thus he had a strong claim to the throne after the Emperor's death, but he concluded an agreement with the Ottonian candidate, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry of Bavaria]] in 1002. Henry restored Carinthia to Otto in 1002 and he ruled the duchy until his death in 1004.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=11, 14, 184, 190 (notes 10 and 12)}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=18\u201319, 23, 361 (note 20)}}\n\n==Dukes and bishops==\n\n{{chart top|Salian dukes and bishops}}\n{{Tree chart/start|align=center}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | |SEE1|SEE1=''[[#Early Salians|Early Salians]]''|boxstyle_SEE1=background-color:#F5FAFF}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | | |Q|}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | | |!|}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | |OTT|~|y|~|JUD|OTT=[[Otto I, Duke of Carinthia|Otto of Worms]]<br>\u20201004<br>D. of Carinthia<br>({{reign|978|985|1002|1004}})|JUD=Judith<br>\u2020991|boxstyle_OTT=background-color:#CEE0F2}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|.|}}\n{{Tree chart|ADE|~|y|~|HEN| | |GRE| | |MAT|~|y|~|CON1| | |WIL|ADE=Adelaide of Metz<br>\u20201039/1046|HEN=[[Henry of Speyer|Henry of Worms]]<br>\u2020990/991 (?)|GRE=[[Pope Gregory V]]<br>*972 \u2020999<br>({{reign|996|999}})|MAT=[[Matilda of Swabia]]<br>\u20201031/32|CON1=[[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I]]<br>\u20201011<br>D. of Carinthia<br>({{reign|1004|1011}})|WIL=[[William I (bishop of Strasbourg)|William]]<br>\u20201046/47<br>B. of Strasbourg<br>({{reign|1028/29|1046/47}})|boxstyle_HEN=background-color:#CEE0F2|boxstyle_GRE=background-color:#CEE0F2|boxstyle_CON1=background-color:#CEE0F2|boxstyle_WIL=background-color:#CEE0F2}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | |Q| | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|^|-|-|.|}}\n{{Tree chart| | | |SEE2| | | | | | | | | | |CON2| | | |BRU|SEE2=''[[#Imperial Salians|Imperial Salians]]''|CON2=[[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad II]]<br>*1002\u201305 \u20201039<br>D. of Carinthia<br>({{reign|1036|1039}})|BRU=[[Bruno (bishop of W\u00fcrzburg)|Bruno]]<br>\u20201045<br>B. of W\u00fcrzburg<br>({{reign|1034|1045}})|boxstyle_SEE2=background-color:#F5FAFF|boxstyle_CON2=background-color:#CEE0F2|boxstyle_BRU=background-color:#CEE0F2}}\n{{Tree chart/end}}\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n===Henry of Worms===\n\n{{Main|Henry of Speyer}}\n\n[[File:Otto III wird von Papst Gregor V. zum Kaiser gesalbt.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A young man wearing tiara touches the head of a bearded man sitting on his side, with two men watching the scene.|Pope Gregory&nbsp;V annoints Emperor Otto&nbsp;III (a miniature by an unidentified author, {{circa}} 1450).]]\n\nHenry was Otto of Worms's eldest son.

Early in 1026 Conrad went to [[Milan]], where [[Archbishop Aribert of Milan|Ariberto]], [[archbishop of Milan]], crowned him [[king of Italy]]. When [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died 1032, Conrad II also claimed this kingship on the basis of an inheritance Henry II had extorted from the former in 1006. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy would become known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors.\n\nAlready in 1028 Conrad II had his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] elected and anointed king of Germany. Henry's tenure led to an overstatement of previously unknown sacral kingship. So during this reign [[Speyer Cathedral]] was expanded to be the largest church in Western Christendom. Henry's conception of a legitimate power of royal disposition in the duchies was successful against the dukes, and thus secured royal control. However, in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]], this led to years of conflict, from which Henry emerged as the winner. But also in southern Germany a powerful opposition group was formed in the years 1052\u20131055. 1046 Henry ended the [[Schism (religion)|papal schism]], freed the Papacy from dependence on the Roman nobility, and laid the basis for its universal applicability. His early death in 1056 was long regarded as a disaster for the Empire.\n[[File:SpeyererDom vonSuedWesten.JPG|left|thumb|[[Speyer Cathedral]], burial place of all Salian Emperors]]\nThe early Salians owed much of their success to their alliance with the [[Catholic Church|Church]], a policy begun by Otto I, which gave them the material support they needed to subdue rebellious dukes. In time, however, the Church came to regret this close relationship. The alliance broke down in 1075 during what came to be known as the [[Investiture Controversy]] (or ''Investiture Dispute''), a struggle in which the reformist Pope, [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], demanded that Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] renounce his rights over the Church in Germany. The pope also attacked the concept of monarchy by divine right and gained the support of significant elements of the German nobility interested in limiting imperial absolutism. More important, the pope forbade ecclesiastical officials under pain of excommunication to support Henry as they had so freely done in the past. In the end, Henry IV journeyed to [[Canossa]] in northern [[Italy]] in 1077 to do penance and to receive absolution from the pope. However, he resumed the practice of lay investiture (appointment of religious officials by civil authorities) and arranged the election of an [[antipope]] ([[Antipope Clement III]]) in 1080.\n\nThe monarch's struggle with the papacy resulted in a war that ravaged through the Holy Roman Empire from 1077 until the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. The reign of the last ruler of the Salian dynasty [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] coincided with the final phase of the great [[Investiture Controversy]], which had pitted pope against emperor. By the settlement of the Concordat of Worms, Henry V surrendered to the demands of the second generation of [[Gregorian reform]]ers. This agreement stipulated that the pope would appoint high church officials but gave the German king the right to veto the papal choices. Imperial control of Italy was lost for a time, and the imperial crown became dependent on the political support of competing aristocratic factions. Feudalism also became more widespread as freemen sought protection by swearing allegiance to a lord. These powerful local rulers, having thereby acquired extensive territories and large military retinues, took over administration within their territories and organized it around an increasing number of castles. The most powerful of these local rulers came to be called princes rather than dukes.\n\nAccording to the laws of the feudal system of the Holy Roman Empire, the king had no claims on the vassals of the other princes, only on those living within his family's territory. Lacking the support of the formerly independent vassals and weakened by the increasing hostility of the Church, the monarchy lost its pre-eminence. Thus the Investiture Contest strengthened local power in the Holy Roman Empire \u2013 in contrast to the trend in France and England, where centralized royal power grew. The Investiture Contest had an additional effect. The long struggle between emperor and pope hurt the Holy Roman Empire's intellectual life, in this period largely confined to monasteries, and the empire no longer led or even kept pace with developments occurring in [[France]] and [[Italy]]. For instance, no universities were founded in the Holy Roman Empire until the fourteenth century.\n\nThe first [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] king [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] was a grandson of the Salian [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. ([[Agnes of Waiblingen|Agnes]], Henry IV's daughter and Henry V's sister, was the heiress of Salian dynasty's lands: her first marriage produced the royal and imperial [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty and her second marriage the ducal [[Babenberg]] potentates of [[Duchy of Austria]] which was elevated much due to such connections [[Privilegium Minus]].){{huh|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Salian Kings and Emperors==\n{{Salian dynasty}}\n* [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] 1024\u20131039, crowned emperor on 26 March 1027\n* [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] 1039\u20131056, crowned emperor on 25 December 1046\n* [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] 1056\u20131106, crowned emperor on 31 March 1084\n** [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad (III)]] 1087\u20131098, nominal king under his father Henry IV\n* [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] 1106\u20131125, crowned emperor on 13 April 1111\n\nTheir regnal dates as emperor take into account elections and subsequent [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|coronations]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Concordat of Worms]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{loc}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last=Schutz|first=Herbert|author-link=Herbert Schutz|year=2010|title=The Medieval Empire in Central Europe: Dynastic Continuity in the Post-Carolingian Frankish Realm, 900-1300|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-1966-4|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Weinfurter|first=Stefan|orig-year=1992|year=1999|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|translator-last=Kaiser|translator-first=Denise A.|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Herwig|authorlink=Herwig Wolfram|orig-year=2000|year=2006|title=Conrad II, 990\u20131039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms|translator-last=Bowlus|translator-first=Barbara M.|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=0-271-02738-X|ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* Lenelotte M\u00f6ller, Hans Ammerich: Die Salier. 1024-1125.

The dynasty provided four [[kings of Germany]] (1024\u20131125), all of whom went on to be crowned [[Holy Roman emperors]] (1027\u20131125).\n\nAfter the death of the last [[Ottonian]] emperor in 1024, the [[Kingdom of Germany]] and later the entire [[Holy Roman Empire]] passed to [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], a Salian. He was followed by three more Salian rulers: [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], and [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]]. They established their monarchy as a major European power. They achieved the development of a permanent administrative system based on a class of public officials answerable to the crown.\n\n==Origins and name==\n\n[[File:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|right|Family tree of the imperial dynasties of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]: Carolingians, Ottonians, Salians and Hohenstaufen.]]\n\nModern historians suppose that the Salians descended from the [[Widonids]], a prominent noble kindred emerging in the 7th&nbsp;century. Their estates were located at the confluence of rivers [[Moselle]] and [[Saar (river)|Saar]] and they supported the [[Carolingians]]. The Widonids' eastward expansion towards the river [[Rhine]] started after they founded [[Hornbach Abbey]] in the [[Bliesgau]] around 750. Hornbach remained their [[proprietary church|proprietary monastery]] and royal grants to the abbey established their presence in the [[Wormsgau]]. As time passed, several branches split off the Widonids. The late 9th-century Holy Roman Emperor [[Guy III of Spoleto|Guy (or Wido) of Spoleto]] descended from one of these branches, the Lambertines. The Salians' forefathers remained in [[Duchy of Franconia|Rhenish Franconia]]. {{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=7\u20139}}\n\n[[Wipo of Burgundy]], the biographer of the first Salian monarch, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Conrad&nbsp;II]], described Conrad's father and uncle as \"distinguished noble lords from Rhenish Franconia\", but without calling them Salians around 1044. Wipo added that Conrad's mother, [[Adelaide of Metz]], \"supposedly descended from the ancient royal house of [[Troy]]\". The statement made a connection between Conrad and the royal [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]] who had claimed a Troyan ancestry for themselves. Historian Stefan Weinfurter proposes that the putative relatinship between the Salians and the Merovingians gave rise to the family name, because the Salian Franks had been the most renowned Frankish group. Their memory was preserved through a Frankish law code, known as [[Salic law]]. A less likely [[etimology]] links the appelation to the old German world ''sal'' (\"lordship\"), proposing that the name can be traced to the Salian monarchs' well-documented inclination towards hierarchical structures.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe term ''reges salici'' (or Salian kings) was most probably coined early in the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=5}} A list of monarchs and archbishop from [[Mainz]], which was completed around 1139\u201340, is the first extant document to contain it. Bishop [[Otto of Freising]], a maternal descendant of the Salian monarchs, also used the term in his ''Chronicle or History of the Two Cities'' in the middle of the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=15}} In a narrow sense, only the four German monarchs who ruled from 1024 to 1125 could be called Salians, but the same appelation have already been expanded to their ancestors by modern historians.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=5}}\n\nAll male members of the family who were destined to a secular career were named [[Conrad (name)|Conrad]] or [[Henry (given name)|Henry]]. Emperor Conrad&nbsp;II's grandfather, [[Otto I, Duke of Carinthia|Otto of Worms]], established this tradition in the late 10th&nbsp;century. He named his eldest son, [[Henry of Speyer|Henry of Worms]], after his maternal great-grandfather, King [[Henry the Fowler]]; and he gave the name of his father, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], to one of his younger sons, [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]].

He married a kinswoman, most probably a sister, of King Conrad&nbsp;I of Germany.

His family links with the Conradines facilitated his acquisition of large portions of their domains after King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&nbsp;I of Germany]] crushed their revolt in 939. The Conradines lost their preeminent position in Franconia and Conrad the Red emerged as Otto&nbsp;I's principal supporter in the region. He was awarded with the [[Duchy of Lotharingia]] in 944 or 945 and he married the King's daughter, [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Luidgard]], in 947. The marriage forged a link between the royal [[Ottonian dynasty]] and the Salians. He lost Lotharingia after he joined a revolt against his father-in-law in 953 or 954. He died fighting against the invading [[Magyars]] in the [[Battle of Lech]] in 955. The contemporaneous [[Widukind of Corvey]] praised him for his bravery. He was buried in the [[Worms Cathedral]], although mainly bishops and kings had so far been buried in cathedrals.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=6, 9}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=18, 361 (note 22)}}\n\n===Otto of Worms===\n{{Main|Otto I, Duke of Carinthia}}\n\nConrad the Red's son, Otto of Worms, founded favour with his maternal granfather, King (from 962 Emperor) Otto&nbsp;I. Still a minor, he was mentioned as a count in the [[Nahegau]] in 956. He also seized Wormsgau, Speyergau, [[Niddagau]], [[Elsenzgau]], [[Kraichgau]] and [[Pfinzgau]], thus uniting almost all lands between the rivers Rhine and [[Neckar]] by the time Otto&nbsp;I deceased in 973. The parentage of his wife, Judith, is uncertain: she may have been related either to [[Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria]], to Count Henry of Arlon, or to [[Burkhard, Margrave of Austria|Burchard, Margrave in the Eastern Marches]]. Otto&nbsp;I's son and successor, Emperor [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&nbsp;II]], was obviously worried aboukt the concentration of lands in his nephew's hands in Franconia. The Emperor appointed Otto of Worms to administer the faraway [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and [[March of Verona]] in 978. The Emperor also persuaded Otto to cede his right to administer justice in Worms and also parts of his revenues in the town to the [[Bishop of Worms|local bishop]]. Otto was persuaded to renounce Carinthia and Verona, but he was lavishly compensated with a large forest in [[Wasgau]], the royal palace at [[Kaiserslautern]] and the properiatery rights over [[Weissenburg Abbey, Alsace|Weissenburg Abbey]]. He could also preserve the title of duke, thus he was the first duke to bear the title without ruling a duchy in Germany. Otto was the cousin of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor]], thus he had a strong claim to the throne after the Emperor's death, but he concluded an agreement with the Ottonian candidate, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry of Bavaria]] in 1002. Henry restored Carinthia to Otto in 1002 and he ruled the duchy until his death in 1004.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=11, 14, 184, 190 (notes 10 and 12)}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=18\u201319, 23, 361 (note 20)}}\n\n==Dukes and bishops==\n\n{{chart top|Salian dukes and bishops}}\n{{Tree chart/start|align=center}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | |SEE1|SEE1=''[[#Early Salians|Early Salians]]''|boxstyle_SEE1=background-color:#F5FAFF}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | | |Q|}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | | |!|}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | |OTT|~|y|~|JUD|OTT=[[Otto I, Duke of Carinthia|Otto of Worms]]<br>\u20201004<br>D. of Carinthia<br>({{reign|978|985|1002|1004}})|JUD=Judith<br>\u2020991|boxstyle_OTT=background-color:#CEE0F2}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|.|}}\n{{Tree chart|ADE|~|y|~|HEN| | |GRE| | |MAT|~|y|~|CON1| | |WIL|ADE=Adelaide of Metz<br>\u20201039/1046|HEN=[[Henry of Speyer|Henry of Worms]]<br>\u2020990/991 (?)|GRE=[[Pope Gregory V]]<br>*972 \u2020999<br>({{reign|996|999}})|MAT=[[Matilda of Swabia]]<br>\u20201031/32|CON1=[[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I]]<br>\u20201011<br>D. of Carinthia<br>({{reign|1004|1011}})|WIL=[[William I (bishop of Strasbourg)|William]]<br>\u20201046/47<br>B. of Strasbourg<br>({{reign|1028/29|1046/47}})|boxstyle_HEN=background-color:#CEE0F2|boxstyle_GRE=background-color:#CEE0F2|boxstyle_CON1=background-color:#CEE0F2|boxstyle_WIL=background-color:#CEE0F2}}\n{{Tree chart| | | | |Q| | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|^|-|-|.|}}\n{{Tree chart| | | |SEE2| | | | | | | | | | |CON2| | | |BRU|SEE2=''[[#Imperial Salians|Imperial Salians]]''|CON2=[[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad II]]<br>*1002\u201305 \u20201039<br>D. of Carinthia<br>({{reign|1036|1039}})|BRU=[[Bruno (bishop of W\u00fcrzburg)|Bruno]]<br>\u20201045<br>B. of W\u00fcrzburg<br>({{reign|1034|1045}})|boxstyle_SEE2=background-color:#F5FAFF|boxstyle_CON2=background-color:#CEE0F2|boxstyle_BRU=background-color:#CEE0F2}}\n{{Tree chart/end}}\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n===Henry of Worms===\n\n{{Main|Henry of Speyer}}\n\n[[File:Otto III wird von Papst Gregor V. zum Kaiser gesalbt.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A young man wearing tiara touches the head of a bearded man sitting on his side, with two men watching the scene.|Pope Gregory&nbsp;V annoints Emperor Otto&nbsp;III (a miniature by an unidentified author, {{circa}} 1450).]]\n\nHenry was Otto of Worms's eldest son.

Early in 1026 Conrad went to [[Milan]], where [[Archbishop Aribert of Milan|Ariberto]], [[archbishop of Milan]], crowned him [[king of Italy]]. When [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died 1032, Conrad II also claimed this kingship on the basis of an inheritance Henry II had extorted from the former in 1006. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy would become known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors.\n\nAlready in 1028 Conrad II had his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] elected and anointed king of Germany. Henry's tenure led to an overstatement of previously unknown sacral kingship. So during this reign [[Speyer Cathedral]] was expanded to be the largest church in Western Christendom. Henry's conception of a legitimate power of royal disposition in the duchies was successful against the dukes, and thus secured royal control. However, in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]], this led to years of conflict, from which Henry emerged as the winner. But also in southern Germany a powerful opposition group was formed in the years 1052\u20131055. 1046 Henry ended the [[Schism (religion)|papal schism]], freed the Papacy from dependence on the Roman nobility, and laid the basis for its universal applicability. His early death in 1056 was long regarded as a disaster for the Empire.\n[[File:SpeyererDom vonSuedWesten.JPG|left|thumb|[[Speyer Cathedral]], burial place of all Salian Emperors]]\nThe early Salians owed much of their success to their alliance with the [[Catholic Church|Church]], a policy begun by Otto I, which gave them the material support they needed to subdue rebellious dukes. In time, however, the Church came to regret this close relationship. The alliance broke down in 1075 during what came to be known as the [[Investiture Controversy]] (or ''Investiture Dispute''), a struggle in which the reformist Pope, [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], demanded that Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] renounce his rights over the Church in Germany. The pope also attacked the concept of monarchy by divine right and gained the support of significant elements of the German nobility interested in limiting imperial absolutism. More important, the pope forbade ecclesiastical officials under pain of excommunication to support Henry as they had so freely done in the past. In the end, Henry IV journeyed to [[Canossa]] in northern [[Italy]] in 1077 to do penance and to receive absolution from the pope. However, he resumed the practice of lay investiture (appointment of religious officials by civil authorities) and arranged the election of an [[antipope]] ([[Antipope Clement III]]) in 1080.\n\nThe monarch's struggle with the papacy resulted in a war that ravaged through the Holy Roman Empire from 1077 until the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. The reign of the last ruler of the Salian dynasty [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] coincided with the final phase of the great [[Investiture Controversy]], which had pitted pope against emperor. By the settlement of the Concordat of Worms, Henry V surrendered to the demands of the second generation of [[Gregorian reform]]ers. This agreement stipulated that the pope would appoint high church officials but gave the German king the right to veto the papal choices. Imperial control of Italy was lost for a time, and the imperial crown became dependent on the political support of competing aristocratic factions. Feudalism also became more widespread as freemen sought protection by swearing allegiance to a lord. These powerful local rulers, having thereby acquired extensive territories and large military retinues, took over administration within their territories and organized it around an increasing number of castles. The most powerful of these local rulers came to be called princes rather than dukes.\n\nAccording to the laws of the feudal system of the Holy Roman Empire, the king had no claims on the vassals of the other princes, only on those living within his family's territory. Lacking the support of the formerly independent vassals and weakened by the increasing hostility of the Church, the monarchy lost its pre-eminence. Thus the Investiture Contest strengthened local power in the Holy Roman Empire \u2013 in contrast to the trend in France and England, where centralized royal power grew. The Investiture Contest had an additional effect. The long struggle between emperor and pope hurt the Holy Roman Empire's intellectual life, in this period largely confined to monasteries, and the empire no longer led or even kept pace with developments occurring in [[France]] and [[Italy]]. For instance, no universities were founded in the Holy Roman Empire until the fourteenth century.\n\nThe first [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] king [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] was a grandson of the Salian [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. ([[Agnes of Waiblingen|Agnes]], Henry IV's daughter and Henry V's sister, was the heiress of Salian dynasty's lands: her first marriage produced the royal and imperial [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty and her second marriage the ducal [[Babenberg]] potentates of [[Duchy of Austria]] which was elevated much due to such connections [[Privilegium Minus]].){{huh|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Salian Kings and Emperors==\n{{Salian dynasty}}\n* [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] 1024\u20131039, crowned emperor on 26 March 1027\n* [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] 1039\u20131056, crowned emperor on 25 December 1046\n* [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] 1056\u20131106, crowned emperor on 31 March 1084\n** [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad (III)]] 1087\u20131098, nominal king under his father Henry IV\n* [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] 1106\u20131125, crowned emperor on 13 April 1111\n\nTheir regnal dates as emperor take into account elections and subsequent [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|coronations]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Concordat of Worms]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{loc}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last=Schutz|first=Herbert|author-link=Herbert Schutz|year=2010|title=The Medieval Empire in Central Europe: Dynastic Continuity in the Post-Carolingian Frankish Realm, 900-1300|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-1966-4|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Weinfurter|first=Stefan|orig-year=1992|year=1999|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|translator-last=Kaiser|translator-first=Denise A.|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Herwig|authorlink=Herwig Wolfram|orig-year=2000|year=2006|title=Conrad II, 990\u20131039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms|translator-last=Bowlus|translator-first=Barbara M.|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=0-271-02738-X|ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* Lenelotte M\u00f6ller, Hans Ammerich: Die Salier. 1024-1125.
