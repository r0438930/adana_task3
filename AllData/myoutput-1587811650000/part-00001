[[World War II]] is a recurring theme in his work. He is a key figure of the generation of [[New European Painting|European figurative painters]] who gained renown at a time when many believed the medium had lost its relevance due to the [[Information Age|new digital age]]. \n\nMuch of Tuymans\u2019 work deals with moral complexity, specifically the coexistence of \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nina|first=Siegal|title=Luc Tuymans, Master of Moral Complexities, Tries Something New|journal=|date=21 March 2019 | publisher=The New York Times | location=New York |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/arts/design/luc-tuymans-palazzo-grassi-mosaic-la-pelle.html | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190610015254/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/arts/design/luc-tuymans-palazzo-grassi-mosaic-la-pelle.html | archivedate=10 June 2019 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> His subjects range from major historical events such as [[the Holocaust]] to the seemingly inconsequential or banal: wallpaper, Christmas decorations or everyday objects for example. \n\nThe artist's sparsely-coloured [[Figurative painting|figurative paintings]] are made up of quick brush strokes of wet paint. Tuymans paints from [[Photographic image|photographic]] or [[Cinematography|cinematic]] images drawn from the media or [[public sphere]], as well as from his own [[Photograph|photographs]] and [[Drawing|drawings]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidzwirner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FINAL_LT_Press_Release.pdf | title=Luc Tuymans:  Forever, The Management of Magic | date=14 February \u2013 22 March 2008 | publisher=[[David Zwirner Gallery]] | location=New York | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301030757/http://www.davidzwirner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FINAL_LT_Press_Release.pdf | archivedate=1 March 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"roger travels\">{{cite book | last1 = Roger | first1 = White | title = The contemporaries travels in the 21st-century art world | publisher=Bloomsbury | series = | volume = 1 | edition = | location = New York | date = 2016 | page = 173 | isbn = 9781620400951 | OCLC = 1124364481}}</ref> They often appear intentionally [[out of focus]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions/226/ | title=Luc Tuymans: Corporate. 6 November\u201321 December 2010 | date = | publisher=[[David Zwirner Gallery]] | location=New York | url-status = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidzwirner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FINAL_LT_Press_Release.pdf | title=Luc Tuymans: Forever, The Management of Magic. 14 February\u201322 March 2008 | date = 29 January 2008 | publisher=[[David Zwirner Gallery]] | location=New York | url-status = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"roger travels\"/> The blurred effect is, however, created purposefully with painted strokes, it is not the result of a \u2018wiping away\u2019 technique.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Why-paintings-succeed-where-words-fail/19286 | title=Why paintings succeed where words fail | last = Harris | first = Gareth | date=9 September 2009 | publisher=The Art Newspaper | location=New York | url-status=dead | archiveurl = | archivedate = | df=dmy-all }}</ref> \n\nFormal and conceptual oppositions recur in his work, which is echoed in his remark that while \u2018sickness should appear in the way the painting is made\u2019 there is also pleasure in its making \u2013 a \u2018caressing\u2019 of the canvas.

The painting ''Gaskamer'' (''Gas Chamber'') exemplifies his use of titles to provoke associations in the mind of the viewer. Meaning, in his work, is never fixed; his paintings incite thought. A related characteristic of Tuymans' work is the way he often works in series, a method which enables one image to generate another through which images can be formulated and reformulated ad infinitum. Images are repeatedly analysed and distilled, and a large number of drawings, photocopies and [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] are produced in preparation for his oil paintings.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/luc_tuymans_hoxton_square_2001 | title=Exhibitions - The Rumour, 5 September \u2014 13 October 2001 | date=1 March 2020 | publisher=White Cube | location=London | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301113132/https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/luc_tuymans_hoxton_square_2001 | archivedate=1 March 2020 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=Tate2004/> Each final painting is, however, completed in a single day.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Mullins | first1 = Charlotte | title = Painting People: Figure Painting Today | publisher=D.A.P./Distributed Art Publishers | series = | volume = | edition = | location = New York | date = 2008 | page = 150 | isbn = 9781933045832 | OCLC = 216938984}}</ref>  \n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Luc Tuymans Antichambre 1985 Collection M HKA - Collection of the Flemish Community.jpg|thumb|270px|<small>Luc Tuymans, ''Antichambre'', 1985<br>Oil on canvas, 69.9 \u00d7 80.1 cm, 271\u20442 \u00d7 319\u204416 inches, Collection [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Antwerp|M HKA Museum of Contemporary Art, Antwerp]] - Collection of the Flemish Community</small>|alt=]]\n[[File:Luc Tuymans Body 1990 Collection S.M.A.K.

The following year, they published the project in the ''Tijdschrift voor levende Volkskunst'' (''Journal of Living Folk Art''), as a journal modelled on the historical ''Volksfoto'' magazine.

This project involved interpreting the town\u2019s history through artworks which were spread across over twenty locations. Tuymans contributed the painting ''Die Nacht'' (2012), which refers to [[Hans-J\u00fcrgen Syberberg]]\u2019s epic 1985 film installation on [[German history]]. During the second season in 2012, this painting hung in Ba\u0142ka\u2019s childhood bedroom. Tuymans also installed hundreds of black balloons in the ruins of Zofi\u00f3wka, a former hospital for people with mental health conditions. In 1940, the building was part of the Otwock ghetto, and in 1942, during the [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Nazi occupation of Poland]], its inhabitants either died of starvation, were shot, or were sent to the [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka concentration camp]].<ref>afterall.org, 8 May 2014.</ref> \n\nAt the retrospective exhibition entitled ''Intolerance'' staged by [[Qatar Museums Authority|QM Gallery Al Riwaq]] in Doha in 2016, Tuymans presented a new body of work entitled ''The Arena I\u2013VI''. These works depict violence in 1942. \u2018With visual similarities to Francisco Goya\u2019s ''The Third of May 1808'', 1814, Tuymans\u2019 strong highlighting of central figures encased by a blackened, scruffy vignette suggests a diaspora, revolution, or an uneasy static mob.

Important features of Tuymans' artistic approach can be found in these preparatory pieces such as his voluntary choice of low-quality materials and his incorporation of found elements. Such works are both visual preparations for later paintings and exteriorisations of thought processes. As Tuymans said in an interview with Josef Helfenstein in 1997: \u2018drawing is particularly important because I become mentally involved in the work and the picture. What is important for me is the idea of thinking while I draw, particularly in the tiny drawings.

Each drawing is more than a visual record: it forms part of a wider reflective process. The first comprehensive exhibition of Tuymans' drawings and other works on paper from the years 1975\u201396 was on view in an exhibition that travelled to [[Kunsthalle Bern]], Bern; [[Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive|Berkeley Art Museum]], Berkeley; and [[CAPC mus\u00e9e d'art contemporain de Bordeaux|Capc Mus\u00e9e d'art contemporain]], Bordeaux (in 1997\u201398).\n\n===Murals ===\n{{See also|List of Murals by Luc Tuymans}}\n[[File:Luc_tuymans33424762.ogg|thumb|thumbtime=1:00thumbtime=2:09|right|270px|Luc Tuymans talks about his triptych mural <br>''St. Croce'', 2010, MCA Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.]]\n\nTuymans has made about 50 site-specific murals since the mid-1990s, five permanent and the rest temporary. Unlike the permanent mural paintings, Tuymans other mural paintings are temporary events and installations created for exhibitions. The type of mural techniques used is either acrylic paint or fresco applied directly on the existing wall surfaces. On rare occasions, he also made textile murals, which are based on drawings that are scanned and mechanically produced. As he said in a video interview he gave about the triptych mural painting ''S. Croce'' (2010), they are always related to the 'raw space' and 'it is the element of approach which is important with murals', he also mentioned that 'If I work on a wall I feel much more free than on a canvas.' \n\nThe first permanent mural was created in 1995 in Antwerp at Caf\u00e9 Alberto.

[[World War II]] is a recurring theme in his work. He is a key figure of the generation of [[New European Painting|European figurative painters]] who gained renown at a time when many believed the medium had lost its relevance due to the [[Information Age|new digital age]]. \n\nMuch of Tuymans\u2019 work deals with moral complexity, specifically the coexistence of \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nina|first=Siegal|title=Luc Tuymans, Master of Moral Complexities, Tries Something New|journal=|date=21 March 2019 | publisher=The New York Times | location=New York |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/arts/design/luc-tuymans-palazzo-grassi-mosaic-la-pelle.html | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190610015254/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/arts/design/luc-tuymans-palazzo-grassi-mosaic-la-pelle.html | archivedate=10 June 2019 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> His subjects range from major historical events such as [[the Holocaust]] to the seemingly inconsequential or banal: wallpaper, Christmas decorations or everyday objects for example. \n\nThe artist's sparsely-coloured [[Figurative painting|figurative paintings]] are made up of quick brush strokes of wet paint. Tuymans paints from [[Photographic image|photographic]] or [[Cinematography|cinematic]] images drawn from the media or [[public sphere]], as well as from his own [[Photograph|photographs]] and [[Drawing|drawings]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidzwirner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FINAL_LT_Press_Release.pdf | title=Luc Tuymans:  Forever, The Management of Magic | date=14 February \u2013 22 March 2008 | publisher=[[David Zwirner Gallery]] | location=New York | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301030757/http://www.davidzwirner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FINAL_LT_Press_Release.pdf | archivedate=1 March 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"roger travels\">{{cite book | last1 = Roger | first1 = White | title = The contemporaries travels in the 21st-century art world | publisher=Bloomsbury | series = | volume = 1 | edition = | location = New York | date = 2016 | page = 173 | isbn = 9781620400951 | OCLC = 1124364481}}</ref> They often appear intentionally [[out of focus]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions/226/ | title=Luc Tuymans: Corporate. 6 November\u201321 December 2010 | date = | publisher=[[David Zwirner Gallery]] | location=New York | url-status = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.davidzwirner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/FINAL_LT_Press_Release.pdf | title=Luc Tuymans: Forever, The Management of Magic. 14 February\u201322 March 2008 | date = 29 January 2008 | publisher=[[David Zwirner Gallery]] | location=New York | url-status = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"roger travels\"/> The blurred effect is, however, created purposefully with painted strokes, it is not the result of a \u2018wiping away\u2019 technique.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Why-paintings-succeed-where-words-fail/19286 | title=Why paintings succeed where words fail | last = Harris | first = Gareth | date=9 September 2009 | publisher=The Art Newspaper | location=New York | url-status=dead | archiveurl = | archivedate = | df=dmy-all }}</ref> \n\nFormal and conceptual oppositions recur in his work, which is echoed in his remark that while \u2018sickness should appear in the way the painting is made\u2019 there is also pleasure in its making \u2013 a \u2018caressing\u2019 of the canvas.

The painting ''Gaskamer'' (''Gas Chamber'') exemplifies his use of titles to provoke associations in the mind of the viewer. Meaning, in his work, is never fixed; his paintings incite thought. A related characteristic of Tuymans' work is the way he often works in series, a method which enables one image to generate another through which images can be formulated and reformulated ad infinitum. Images are repeatedly analysed and distilled, and a large number of drawings, photocopies and [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] are produced in preparation for his oil paintings.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/luc_tuymans_hoxton_square_2001 | title=Exhibitions - The Rumour, 5 September \u2014 13 October 2001 | date=1 March 2020 | publisher=White Cube | location=London | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301113132/https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/luc_tuymans_hoxton_square_2001 | archivedate=1 March 2020 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=Tate2004/> Each final painting is, however, completed in a single day.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Mullins | first1 = Charlotte | title = Painting People: Figure Painting Today | publisher=D.A.P./Distributed Art Publishers | series = | volume = | edition = | location = New York | date = 2008 | page = 150 | isbn = 9781933045832 | OCLC = 216938984}}</ref>  \n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Luc Tuymans Antichambre 1985 Collection M HKA - Collection of the Flemish Community.jpg|thumb|270px|<small>Luc Tuymans, ''Antichambre'', 1985<br>Oil on canvas, 69.9 \u00d7 80.1 cm, 271\u20442 \u00d7 319\u204416 inches, Collection [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Antwerp|M HKA Museum of Contemporary Art, Antwerp]] - Collection of the Flemish Community</small>|alt=]]\n[[File:Luc Tuymans Body 1990 Collection S.M.A.K.

In 2007, a major [[Retrospective exhibition|retrospective]] was organized by the [[Hall of Art, Budapest|M\u0171csarnok Kunsthalle]] in [[Budapest]] (2007-2008) which travelled as ''Luc Tuymans: Wenn der Fr\u00fchling kommt'' to [[Haus der Kunst]] in [[Munich]] in 2008 and as ''Come and See'' to the [[Zach\u0119ta|Zach\u0119ta National Gallery of Art in Warsaw]]. Each venue had a different set of paintings on show. His 2008 solo show at [[David Zwirner Gallery]], entitled ''The Management of Magic'', explored the \u2018Disney-fication\u2019 of consumer society. From 2009 to 2011, this major exhibition travelled to four cities in [[North America]]: the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]], the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art|SFMOMA San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], [[Dallas Museum of Art|DMA Dallas Museum of Art]], and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|MCA Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago]]. It then moved to its final stop in Belgium at [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels|BOZAR \u2013 Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Barbareschi | first = Beatrice | authorlink = | year = 21 February 2008 | url = http://contemporaryartnewyork.blogspot.com/2008/02/david-zwirner-luc-tuymans-forever.html | publisher = Contemporary Art New York | title = David Zwirner: \u201cLuc Tuymans: Forever, The Management of Magic.\u201d | accessdate = 20 March 2020 | archiveurl = | archivedate = | url-status = | df=dmy-all }}</ref> \n\nBetween 2006 and 2008, solo exhibitions devoted to Tuymans were held in diverse locations: at M\u0171csarnok Kunsthalle in Budapest in 2007\u201308; at Zach\u0119ta National Gallery of Art in Warsaw and at Haus der Kunst in Munich in 2008.\n\nIn 2012, Tuymans was invited by the Polish artist [[Miros\u0142aw Ba\u0142ka]] to take part in a project in the town where [[Miros\u0142aw Ba\u0142ka|Ba\u0142ka]] had grown up: [[Otwock]]. This project involved interpreting the town\u2019s history through artworks which were spread across over twenty locations. Tuymans contributed the painting ''Die Nacht'' (2012), which refers to [[Hans-J\u00fcrgen Syberberg]]\u2019s epic 1985 film installation on [[German history]]. During the second season in 2012, this painting hung in Ba\u0142ka\u2019s childhood bedroom. Tuymans also installed hundreds of black balloons in the ruins of Zofi\u00f3wka, a former hospital for people with mental health conditions. In 1940, the building was part of the Otwock ghetto, and in 1942, during the [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Nazi occupation of Poland]], its inhabitants either died of starvation, were shot, or were sent to the [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka concentration camp]].<ref>afterall.org, 8 May 2014.</ref> \n\nAt the retrospective exhibition entitled ''Intolerance'' staged by [[Qatar Museums Authority|QM Gallery Al Riwaq]] in Doha in 2016, Tuymans presented a new body of work entitled ''The Arena I\u2013VI''. These works depict violence in 1942. \u2018With visual similarities to Francisco Goya\u2019s ''The Third of May 1808'', 1814, Tuymans\u2019 strong highlighting of central figures encased by a blackened, scruffy vignette suggests a diaspora, revolution, or an uneasy static mob.

Sketches, [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] and other small-scale works form the bedrock of his work for they constitute, for him, a way of thinking through an idea. Important features of Tuymans' artistic approach can be found in these preparatory pieces such as his voluntary choice of low-quality materials and his incorporation of found elements. Such works are both visual preparations for later paintings and exteriorisations of thought processes. As Tuymans said in an interview with Josef Helfenstein in 1997: \u2018drawing is particularly important because I become mentally involved in the work and the picture. What is important for me is the idea of thinking while I draw, particularly in the tiny drawings.

Each drawing is more than a visual record: it forms part of a wider reflective process. The first comprehensive exhibition of Tuymans' drawings and other works on paper from the years 1975\u201396 was on view in an exhibition that travelled to [[Kunsthalle Bern]], Bern; [[Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive|Berkeley Art Museum]], Berkeley; and [[CAPC mus\u00e9e d'art contemporain de Bordeaux|Capc Mus\u00e9e d'art contemporain]], Bordeaux (in 1997\u201398).\n\n===Murals ===\n{{See also|List of Murals by Luc Tuymans}}\n[[File:Luc_tuymans33424762.ogg|thumb|thumbtime=1:00thumbtime=2:09|right|270px|Luc Tuymans talks about his triptych mural <br>''St. Croce'', 2010, MCA Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.]]\n\nTuymans has made about 50 site-specific murals since the mid-1990s, five permanent and the rest temporary. Unlike the permanent mural paintings, Tuymans other mural paintings are temporary events and installations created for exhibitions. The type of mural techniques used is either acrylic paint or fresco applied directly on the existing wall surfaces. On rare occasions, he also made textile murals, which are based on drawings that are scanned and mechanically produced. As he said in a video interview he gave about the triptych mural painting ''S. Croce'' (2010), they are always related to the 'raw space' and 'it is the element of approach which is important with murals', he also mentioned that 'If I work on a wall I feel much more free than on a canvas.' \n\nThe first permanent mural was created in 1995 in Antwerp at Caf\u00e9 Alberto. It features a larger version of the painting ''Superstition''.<ref name=Volume22018>Meyer-Hermann, Eva.

It is a 40 m<sup>2</sup> stone mosaic that evokes Tuymans\u2019 painting of the same name created in 2002, which in turn refers to a memorial plaque dedicated to the 16th-century painter [[Quinten Metsys]] from Antwerp which can be found on the facade of the [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Our Lady]] in Antwerp.<ref name=Volume32018/> The painting was first transformed into a grid pattern of 488 by 488 pixels.
