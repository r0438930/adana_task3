It has the same technical base as the [[Walther OSP]] and thus is almost identical in outward appearance, albeit slightly longer and heavier than the OSP.\n\nThe GSP was introduced on the world market in 1968 and was chambered for [[.22 Long Rifle]].  At the end of 1971, Walther began offering the pistol in [[.32 S&W Long]] Wadcutter as well.  Regardless of its original caliber, conversion units for the other caliber are available and easily interchangeable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}  The anatomical, adjustable walnut grips were also available, on order from Walther, for left-handed shooters.  In 1988, Walther introduced a fully adjustable (for pull, stop, and angle) two-stage trigger that athletes could retrofit their pistols with.\n\n==Variants==\nSome of the very early GSPs were missing the slide stop lever which wasn't incorporated until the 1970s.  The early model GSPs, from 1968 to 1977, had a manual safety catch on the left side of the frame.  This feature was omitted in 1977 because it was an unnecessary feature on a competition pistol.  Also throughout the years, the design of the ergonomic grips underwent several changes.\n\nThe GSP chambered for .32 S&W Long WC, sometime referred to as the GSP-C, was intended for use in competitions that only allowed centerfire cartridges.  In 1976, Walther offered the GSP MV, which stands for ''matt vernickelt'' (matte nickel finish).  The MV models were available in both .22 lr and .32 S&W Long calibers.\n\nIn 1992, Walther had a special limited edition of the GSP designated as the 25 Jahre (25th Anniversary Edition).  The frame of this model had a nickel finish and the bolt had a gold titanium finish.  At the time, these sold for 2,549 [[Deutsche Marks]].\n\nIn 1996, Walther produced a GSP Atlanta model commemorating the [[1996 Summer Olympic Games]] in Atlanta.  These ones also had the gold titanium finish on the bolt.\n\nToday, there is also a more accurate version available known as the '''GSP Expert''' which has a vibration-absorbing Aluminum sleeve, containing inertial dampers, around the barrel.\n\nThe Walther GSP is a popular choice for the various 25 m pistol shooting events governed by the [[International Shooting Sport Federation|ISSF]] (some contested at the Olympic games).  The .22 short variant was used in [[rapid fire pistol]]. The .22 LR variant was used for the [[25 m Pistol]] (formerly \"Sport Pistol\"), [[25 m Standard Pistol]] while the .32 caliber variant was used in the [[25 m Center-Fire Pistol]] event.\n\nUnder the N.Y Safe Act the Walther GSP is now classified as an assault weapon under N.Y state law. It is also classified as an assault weapon under Chicago and Cook County laws due to the magazine being outside of the pistol grip.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Walther GSP-Expert 22LR 002 noBG.jpg|A current production Walther GSP Expert in .22 long rifle.\nImage:Walther_GSP_-_right.jpg|A 1986 Walther GSP Junior\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{cite book\n|last=Kersten\n|first=Manfred\n|title=Walther - A German Legend\n|publisher=Safari Press\n|year=2001\n|location=California\n|isbn=1-57157-174-4}}\n\n{{cite book\n|last=Gangarosa, Jr.\n|first=Gene\n|title=The Walther Handgun Story\n|publisher=Stoeger Publishing Company\n|year=1999\n|location=New Jersey\n|isbn=0-88317-214-3}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.carl-walther.de/index.php?company=walther&lang=EN&content=products&hid=1&uid=3 Carl Walther GSP product page]\n{{Walther}}\n\n[[Category:Walther semi-automatic pistols]]\n[[Category:.22 LR pistols]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox weapon\n|name= Walther GSP (Gebrauchs Sportpistole)\n| image= Walther_GSP.jpg\n| image_size = 300\n|caption=A Walther GSP Junior commemorating the 100th Anniversary of [[Walther Arms|Carl Walther Waffenfabrik]] in 1986.\n|origin= [[Germany]]\n|type=Target pistol\n<!-- Type selection -->\n|is_ranged=yes\n<!-- Production history -->\n|designer=Thore Eldh Sweden [[Walther arms|Carl Walther GmbH Sportwaffen]]\n|design_date=\n|manufacturer=[[Walther arms|Carl Walther GmbH Sportwaffen]]\n|unit_cost=\n|production_date=1968-present\n|number=\n|variants= GSP, <br />GSP-C, <br />GSP MV, <br />GSP 25 Jahre (25th Anniversary Model), <br />GSP Atlanta (1996 Olympics Commemorative), <br />GSP Expert\n<!-- General specifications -->\n|weight={{convert|42.33|oz|g|abbr=on}} (.22 LR)<br />{{convert|45.15|oz|abbr=on}} (.32 S&W)<ref name=\"MGV\">{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Philip|title=Gun Digest Book of Modern Gun Values: The Shooter's Guide to Guns 1900 to Present|edition=16th|pages =260}}</ref>\n|length={{convert|17.19|in|cm|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"MGV\"/>\n|part_length={{convert|4.5276|in|cm|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"MGV\"/>\n|width=\n|height=\n|crew=\n<!-- Ranged weapon specifications -->\n|cartridge=[[.22 LR]] (GSP), <br />[[.32 S&W Long]] (GSP-C)<ref name=\"MGV\"/>\n|caliber=\n|action=Single-Action <ref name=\"MGV\"/>\n|rate=\n|velocity=\n|range=\n|max_range=\n|feed= 5-shot [[Magazine (firearms)|Magazine]]<ref name=\"MGV\"/>\n|sights= Fixed front, fully adjustable rear<ref name=\"MGV\"/>\n}}\n\nThe '''Walther GSP''', ''Gebrauchs Sportpistole'' (Sport Pistol for Standard Use), is a single-action, precision targetshooting [[pistol]] made in [[Germany]] by [[Walther arms|Walther Sportwaffen]].
