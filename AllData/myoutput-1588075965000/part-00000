The issuing of banknotes by [[retail bank]]s in Scotland is subject to the [[Banking Act 2009]], which repealed all earlier legislation under which banknote issuance was regulated, and the [[Scottish and Northern Ireland Banknote Regulations 2009]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/banknotes/scottish-northern-ireland/scottish-and-northern-ireland-regime-approach.pdf | title=The Bank of England's approach to regulating Scottish and Northern Ireland commercial banknotes | date=March 2017 | access-date=March 31, 2020}}</ref> Currently, three retail banks are allowed to print notes for circulation in Scotland: [[Bank of Scotland]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], and [[Clydesdale Bank]]. \n\nScottish banknotes are unusual, first because they are issued by retail banks, not government [[central bank]]s, and second, because they are technically not [[legal tender]] anywhere in the United Kingdom \u2013 not even in Scotland.<ref name=\"bankofengland_faqs\">{{cite web| url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/about/faqs.htm#15| title=Are Scottish & Northern Irish notes legal tender?| accessdate=2007-10-14| author = Bank of England- Frequently Asked Questions| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012030427/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/about/faqs.htm| archivedate= 12 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"rm-legal-tender\">{{cite web| title=Legal Tender Guidelines| url=http://www.royalmint.com/corporate/policies/legal_tender_guidelines.aspx| publisher=[[Royal Mint]]| accessdate=2008-11-08| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217182521/http://www.royalmint.com/corporate/policies/legal_tender_guidelines.aspx| archivedate=17 December 2008| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> As such, they are classified as [[promissory note|promissory notes]], and the law requires that the issuing banks hold a sum of [[Bank of England note issues|Bank of England banknotes]] or gold equivalent to the total value of notes issued.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=58254 |date=21 February 2007 |page=2544}}</ref>\n\nThe fact that the notes are not defined as legal tender means that they are not withdrawn from circulation in the same way as the Bank of England notes, which cease to be legal tender on a given date.
