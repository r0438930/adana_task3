Saltdean is approximately 5 miles east of central [[Brighton]], 5 miles west of [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]], and 6 miles south of [[Lewes]]. It is bordered by farmland and the South Downs National Park.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Longridge Avenue Shops - geograph.org.uk - 634584.jpg|thumb|Shops on Longridge Avenue]]\nSaltdean was open farmland, originally a part of the village of [[Rottingdean]], and almost uninhabited until 1924 when land was sold off for speculative housing and property development. Some of this was promoted by entrepreneur [[Charles W. Neville]], who had set up a company to develop the site (he also eventually built nearby towns [[Peacehaven]] and parts of Rottingdean).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saltdean.info/begsaltdean.htm|title=Beginning of Saltdean Today|access-date=12 March 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102171400/http://www.saltdean.info/begsaltdean.htm|archive-date=2 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSaltdean has a mainly shingle beach, fronted by a promenade, the Undercliff Walk, which can be reached directly from the cliff top, by steps from the coast road, or by a subway tunnel from the nearby Lido. The buildings nearest the beach  are the most architecturally varied, and include some influenced by international trends of the inter-war years, e.g. [[Bauhaus]] and [[Cubism]], and there are some which are Spanish influenced.\n\nThe most famous building is the [[Saltdean Lido]] community centre, which includes a public library and iconic open air swimming-pool, designed by architect [[R.W.H. Jones]]. He also designed other buildings in the area, including the former Grand Ocean Hotel, built using [[Art Deco]] 'ocean liner' architecture.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Saltdean story|author=Douglas D'Enno|publisher=Phillimore|year=1985|ISBN=0-85033-573-6}}</ref>\n\nSaltdean is now a prosperous village suburb of the city of Brighton and Hove, whilst its eastern side is administratively part of the neighbouring Lewes District Council.\n\n==Geography==\nSaltdean is situated by the sea in a 'Dean' (Saxon/Old English for 'dry valley'), with the surrounding hills of the South Downs National Park forming a large central dip and valley where the oval shaped Saltdean Park and Lido are located, looking out over the adjacent sea.\n\nTree lined roads and avenues radiate out in wide oval curves from the park in order to follow the contours of the local topography. The plan of the village was designed from inception to vary considerably from neighbouring Peacehaven's more grid-like system.\n\n==Education==\nSaltdean Primary School is the only school in Saltdean, it is well subscribed and very highly regarded. There is also a library located in the Lido Community building.\n\n==Sport and leisure==\n\nSaltdean has a [[non-League football]] club [[Saltdean United F.C.]] who play at Hill Park. Saltdean also has 4 hard tennis courts, an outdoor Bowls green and a skateboard park all located within Saltdean Park. A sea swimming group meets weekly on the beach and holds traditional Boxing Day and New Year's Day swims.\n\n==Cultural references==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nSaltdean is referenced in the chapter \"The Sensational Sage of the Saltdean Stallion\" of the fantasy novel ''[[The Brightonomicon]]''. The book \"Poems from a Cave in Saltdean\" (2010) makes reference to local geography.\n\nThe changing landscape of Saltdean in the 20th century is referenced in the song \"'Ouses, 'Ouses, 'Ouses\" on the album \"The Imagined Village\" on Real World Records.
