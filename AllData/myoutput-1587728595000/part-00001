Among her most acclaimed films of late 1960s include ''[[Teesri Kasam]]'' (1966), ''[[Ram Aur Shyam]]'' (1967), [[Neel Kamal (1968 film)|''Neel Kamal'']] (1968) and [[Khamoshi (1970 film)|Khamoshi]] (1969). The last three movies all earned Rehman consecutive nominations for Filmfare Award for Best Actress each, with her winning<ref name=\":0\" /> her second Filmfare Award in ''Neel Kamal''. In her role in ''Khamoshi'' starring alongside Rajesh Khanna and [[Dharmendra]], it is believed to be Rehman's finest acting performance.

At the end of the 1960s, Rehman ranked a new record amongst herself in becoming the second-paid actress in Bollywood, from 1964-1969.

Seeing her films being successful, Waheeda decided to experiment with roles at this stage of career. She accepted ''[[Reshma Aur Shera]]'', opposite her old co-star [[Sunil Dutt]], with whom she had previously in the sixties had hits such as ''[[Ek Phool Char Kaante]]'', ''[[Mujhe Jeene Do]]'', ''[[Meri Bhabhi]]'' and ''[[Darpan]]''. Her performance was appreciated by critics, but the film failed at the box office. But Waheeda continued to experiment with roles and accepted the offer to play a mother to [[Jaya Bhaduri]] in ''[[Phagun (1973 film)|Phagun]]'' (1973). This, she regards the mistake of her career, as after this film flopped, suddenly people started offering her motherly roles to heroes.[[File:Nanda-Waheeda-Helen-Sadhana.jpg|thumb|200x200px|(L-R) [[Nanda (actress)|Nanda]], Waheeda Rehman, [[Helen (actress)|Helen]] and [[Sadhana Shivdasani|Sadhana]] ]]Film expert Rajesh Subramanian reported that Manmohan Desai had approached Rehman, on behalf of Shammi Kapoor, during the making of ''Naseeb''.

Her film debut occurred in the Telugu film ''[[Rojulu Maraayi]]'' (1955), in which she was encouraged by the producer of the film to join the cast, despite hesitance from her mother. It was a success, becoming a channel for more offers from filmmakers to Rehman. She was featured in ''[[Jayasimha (1955 film)|Jayasimha]]'' (1955), ''Kaalam Maari Pochu'' (1956) and the first full-length colour Tamil film ''[[Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum (1956 film)|Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum]]'' (1956).\n[[File:Waheeda ji in Pyaasa.jpg|left|thumb|298x298px|Rehman in ''Pyaasa'' (1957)]]\nIn the success party of ''Rojolu Maraayi'', Hindi filmmaker Guru Dutt noticed her and decided to have her act in Hindi films.

(1956 film)|CID]]'' (1956), directed by [[Raj Khosla]]. Because of the famous Hindi actresses of that era, such as [[Madhubala]], [[Nargis]] and [[Meena Kumari]], Rehman was pressurized into changing her name into \"something sexy\", but she was adamant on keeping her birth name, signifying her will to stay true to herself.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/was-a-stubborn-newcomer-in-industry-waheeda-rehman/articleshow/45980487.cms?from=mdr|title=Was a stubborn newcomer in industry: Waheeda Rehman|date=2015-01-22|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref> The success of the film caused Dutt to give Rehman her first leading role as a prostitute in ''[[Pyaasa]]'' (1957), which was also a commercial success and became one of Dutt's most acclaimed movies. By the time the decade was over, she had made a few more films with the filmmaker, including [[12 O'Clock (film)|''12 O'Clock'']] (1958) and ''[[Kaagaz Ke Phool]]'' (1959). After several years in the industry, her mother died.\n\nRehman also established a working relationship with [[Dev Anand]], and together as a pair, they had a number of successful films to their credit. Including ''CID'', other box office hits are ''[[Solva Saal]]'' (1958), ''[[Kala Bazar]]'' (1960) and ''[[Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja (1961 film)|Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja]]'' (1961).

It was considered a \"saving\" point in Dutt's career, after their last collaboration, ''Kaagaz Ke Phool'', had a horrendous run at the box office. It also represented the strained relationship of the duo. Dutt's existing marriage and her film successes with other directors caused them to drift apart personally and professionally, although they continued to work together into the 1960s.

The main cast were Rehman and Dev Anand, and they were last seen together in ''Baat Ek Raat Ki,'' an average hit at the Indian box office.

Rehman's character was especially praised, with Trisha Gupta of [[Hindustan Times]] writing, \"Rosie was triply unusual: a woman who walks out of an unhappy marriage, begins a romantic relationship with a man who isn\u2019t her husband, and simultaneously embarks on a successful career as a dancer.

She won her first Filmfare Award\u2014[[Filmfare Award for Best Actress]]\u2014and soon after, she became a sought-over actress in the latter half of the 1960s. ''Guide'' became [[List of Indian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|India's official entry to the Oscars]] and a staple film in Hindi cinema.\n\nHer peak continued when she was paired with other well-established superstars, namely [[Dilip Kumar]], [[Rajendra Kumar]], [[Raj Kapoor]], and [[Rajesh Khanna]]. Among her most acclaimed films of late 1960s include ''[[Teesri Kasam]]'' (1966), ''[[Ram Aur Shyam]]'' (1967), [[Neel Kamal (1968 film)|''Neel Kamal'']] (1968) and [[Khamoshi (1970 film)|Khamoshi]] (1969). The last three movies all earned Rehman consecutive nominations for Filmfare Award for Best Actress each, with her winning<ref name=\":0\" /> her second Filmfare Award in ''Neel Kamal''. In her role in ''Khamoshi'' starring alongside Rajesh Khanna and [[Dharmendra]], it is believed to be Rehman's finest acting performance. She plays a nurse who has gone mentally insane after falling in love with one of her patients, and eventually is sent to her own mental institution.\n\nOther films that were commercially successful were ''[[Patthar Ke Sanam]]'' (1967) and ''[[Aadmi (1968 film)|Aadmi]]'' (1968), and box office failures include ''[[Dharti]]'' (1970) and [[Shatranj (1969 film)|''Shatranj'']] (1969). At the end of the 1960s, Rehman ranked a new record amongst herself in becoming the second-paid actress in Bollywood, from 1964-1969. She states herself, \"For ''Solva Saal'', my first film as a freelancer, I received \u20b930,000.

Seeing her films being successful, Waheeda decided to experiment with roles at this stage of career. She accepted ''[[Reshma Aur Shera]]'', opposite her old co-star [[Sunil Dutt]], with whom she had previously in the sixties had hits such as ''[[Ek Phool Char Kaante]]'', ''[[Mujhe Jeene Do]]'', ''[[Meri Bhabhi]]'' and ''[[Darpan]]''. Her performance was appreciated by critics, but the film failed at the box office. But Waheeda continued to experiment with roles and accepted the offer to play a mother to [[Jaya Bhaduri]] in ''[[Phagun (1973 film)|Phagun]]'' (1973). This, she regards the mistake of her career, as after this film flopped, suddenly people started offering her motherly roles to heroes.[[File:Nanda-Waheeda-Helen-Sadhana.jpg|thumb|200x200px|(L-R) [[Nanda (actress)|Nanda]], Waheeda Rehman, [[Helen (actress)|Helen]] and [[Sadhana Shivdasani|Sadhana]] ]]Film expert Rajesh Subramanian reported that Manmohan Desai had approached Rehman, on behalf of Shammi Kapoor, during the making of ''Naseeb''.
