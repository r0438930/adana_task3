The survey was carried out after the success of the [[Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem]] by the newly-founded PEF, with support from the War Office. Twenty-six sheets were produced for \"Western Palestine\" and one sheet for \"Eastern Palestine\". It was the first fully scientific [[Cartography of Palestine|mapping of Palestine]].\n\nBesides being a geographic survey the group collected thousands of place names with the objective of identifying Biblical, Talmudic, early Christian and Crusading locations. The survey resulted in the publication of a map of Palestine consisting of 26 sheets, at a scale of 1:63,360, the most detailed and accurate map of Palestine published in the 19th century.<ref>Palestine Exploration Fund, Quarterly Statement.

He also describes how general publication of the maps and memoirs was held back until the War Office had finished with them for its own purposes. Finally, Moscrop re-examines the payments made by the Fund to those involved in the survey. Revealingly, he finds that for most of the relevant period there is no mention of any payments for the salaries of the Royal Engineers.

Tyrwhitt-Drake died from fever (thought to be [[malaria]]) on 23 June 1874,<ref>PEF Survey of Palestine, 1.I.

The survey was suspended for 15 months following an incident in July 1875 when its members were attacked near [[Safad]] by a group of Algerians. Kitchener returned to the region, completing the remainder of the survey between 27 February 1877 and 27 September, with a total surveyed area of 6,040 sqm.<ref>PEF Survey of Palestine, 1.I. Galilee, p.27-29</ref>\n\n===Eastern Palestine survey===\nThe survey was carried out between August and October 1881 by a team led by Captain Conder. They surveyed 510 sqm of barely populated land, covering an area which included [[Amman]], then an almost uninhabited set of Roman ruins, and the recently repopulated [[Madaba]].<ref>PEF Survey of Eastern Palestine, 1889, page v</ref>\n\n==Leadership==\nThe survey was led at different times by four senior [[Royal Engineers]]:<ref>James, Frances W., \"[http://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/?p=1021  A Milestone in Palestinian Archaeology]\" Expedition Magazine 7.4 (1965), Penn Museum: \"... the party at various times being commanded by Capt.
