{"title_page": "Cabinet of Donald Trump", "text_new": "{{Further| Political appointments by Donald Trump |Formation of Donald Trump's Cabinet}}\n{{short description|The cabinet appointed officers of the executive branch of the federal government of the United States under the administration of Donald Trump}}\n{{Use American English|date = September 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2018}}\n{{Donald Trump series}}\n\nThis article lists the members of President [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]]. Trump assumed office on January 20, 2017 and the President has the authority to nominate members of his [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] to the [[United States Senate]] for confirmation under the [[Appointments Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].\n\nBefore confirmation and during [[United States congressional hearing|congressional hearings]] a high-level career member of an executive department heads this pre-confirmed cabinet on an acting basis. The Cabinet's creation was part of the [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition of power]] following the [[2016 United States presidential election]].\n\nThis page documents the confirmation process for any successful or unsuccessful [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] nominees of [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Presidency of Donald Trump|administration]]. They are listed in order of creation of the Cabinet position (also used as the basis for the [[United States presidential line of succession]]).\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}<!-- show the roles like 6.3 Secretary of Defense, but hide the names like 6.3.1 James Mattis from appearing in the table of contents-->\n\n== Announced nominees ==\nAll members of the [[Cabinet of the United States]] require the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate]] following appointment by the president before taking office. The vice presidency is exceptional in that the position requires election to office pursuant to the [[United States Constitution]]. Although some are afforded cabinet-level rank, non-cabinet members within the [[Executive Office of the President]], such as [[White House Chief of Staff]], [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], and [[White House Press Secretary]], do not hold constitutionally created positions and most do not require Senate confirmation for appointment.\n\nThe following have been named as Cabinet appointees by the President of the United States.

In the case of the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump 2016 campaign]], his former rival for the Republican nomination [[Chris Christie]] was appointed to lead the [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition team]] in May 2016, shortly after [[Ted Cruz]] and [[John Kasich]] suspended their campaigns (thus making Trump the presumptive nominee of the party). In addition to various other responsibilities, the transition team is responsible for making preliminary lists of potential [[executive branch]] appointees\u2014at least for the several dozen high-level positions if not for the several thousand lower-level positions\u2014and doing some early [[vetting]] work on those people.  The transition team also hires policy experts (over 100 in the case of the Trump transition team by October 2016), using primarily federal funds and federal office space, to help plan how the hypothetical-at-the-time future Trump administration will implement their policy-goals via the various federal agencies and departments.\n\nAfter the election in November 2016, when the ticket formed by Trump and Pence defeated the Clinton and Kaine ticket as well as various [[Third party (United States)|third party]] opponents, the transition team [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump#November 11 reshuffle|was quickly reshuffled]] and expanded; [[Mike Pence]] was given the lead role (over [[Chris Christie]]), and several additional top-level transition personnel were added to the transition effort, most of them from the now-finished campaign effort.  During the remainder of 2016, the team continued finding and vetting potential nominees for the various positions, as the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] process was ongoing (including recounts in some states where the winning margin was relatively tiny) and before the presidential [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]] in January 2017.\n\nPresident-elect Trump announced his first post-election Cabinet nominee, [[Jeff Sessions]] for the role of [[United States Attorney General]], on November 18, 2016.  (Trump had earlier announced Mike Pence as his pick for vice-presidential running mate in July 2016, which was shortly thereafter confirmed by the delegates to the [[2016 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] when they officially nominated first Trump and then Pence.)  Although most positions were simultaneously under consideration by the transition team, the official announcement of offers, and the public acceptance of the offers, usually happens gradually as slots are filled ([[Richard Nixon]] being the exception).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| President<ref name=foxnewsNomsByWeek>{{cite tweet|user=FoxNewsResearch|author=Fox News Research|number=798959647453544449|date=November 16, 2016|title=Since 1968, George HW Bush is the only president-elect to announce cabinet nominations within the first week after\u2026|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/graphics/how-donald-trumps-cabinet-nominations-compare-with-previous-presidents/|title=How Donald Trump's Cabinet Nominations Compare with Previous Presidents'|author=Randy Yeip|date=February 7, 2017|accessdate=February 7, 2017|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207114131/http://www.wsj.com/graphics/how-donald-trumps-cabinet-nominations-compare-with-previous-presidents/|archive-date=February 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=cqNomineeDates />\n! colspan=10| Week\n! rowspan=2| Weighted<br />Average\n! rowspan=2| Notes\n|-\n! 1\n! 2\n! 3\n! 4\n! 5\n! 6\n! 7\n! 8\n! 9\n! 10\n|-\n| [[Nixon cabinet and appointments|Nixon '68]]\n| <!-- wk1 -->\n| <!-- wk2 -->\n| <!-- wk3 -->\n| <!-- wk4 -->\n| <!-- wk5 -->\n| <!-- wk6 --> 12\n| <!-- wk7 -->\n| <!-- wk8 -->\n| <!-- wk9 -->\n| <!-- wk10-->\n| style=\"background:linen\" |<!-- avg --> 6.0 weeks\n| <!--notes--> The [[United States Postmaster General|twelfth Cabinet role]] was [[United States Postal Service|quasi-privatized]] in 1971.\n|-\n| [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter#Administration and cabinet|Carter '76]]\n| <!-- wk1 -->\n| <!-- wk2 -->\n| <!-- wk3 -->\n| <!-- wk4 -->\n| <!-- wk5 --> 1\n| <!-- wk6 --> 2\n| <!-- wk7 --> 7\n| <!-- wk8 --> 2\n| <!-- wk9 -->\n| <!-- wk10-->\n| style=\"background:linen\" |<!-- avg --> 6.8 weeks\n| <!--notes--> New roles:  [[United States Secretary of Energy|Energy]] in 1977, [[United States Department of Education|Education]] in 1979.\n|-\n| [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan#Administration and Cabinet|Reagan '80]]\n| <!-- wk1 -->\n| <!-- wk2 -->\n| <!-- wk3 -->\n| <!-- wk4 -->\n| <!-- wk5 -->\n| <!-- wk6 --> 8\n| <!-- wk7 --> 4\n| <!-- wk8 -->\n| <!-- wk9 -->\n| <!-- wk10--> 1\n| style=\"background:linen\" |<!-- avg --> 6.6 weeks\n| <!--notes--> Reagan was unable to [[United States Department of Education#Opposition|abolish the federal Department of Education]].\n|-\n| [[Presidency of George H.

In the case of the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump 2016 campaign]], his former rival for the Republican nomination [[Chris Christie]] was appointed to lead the [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition team]] in May 2016, shortly after [[Ted Cruz]] and [[John Kasich]] suspended their campaigns (thus making Trump the presumptive nominee of the party). In addition to various other responsibilities, the transition team is responsible for making preliminary lists of potential [[executive branch]] appointees\u2014at least for the several dozen high-level positions if not for the several thousand lower-level positions\u2014and doing some early [[vetting]] work on those people.  The transition team also hires policy experts (over 100 in the case of the Trump transition team by October 2016), using primarily federal funds and federal office space, to help plan how the hypothetical-at-the-time future Trump administration will implement their policy-goals via the various federal agencies and departments.\n\nAfter the election in November 2016, when the ticket formed by Trump and Pence defeated the Clinton and Kaine ticket as well as various [[Third party (United States)|third party]] opponents, the transition team [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump#November 11 reshuffle|was quickly reshuffled]] and expanded; [[Mike Pence]] was given the lead role (over [[Chris Christie]]), and several additional top-level transition personnel were added to the transition effort, most of them from the now-finished campaign effort.  During the remainder of 2016, the team continued finding and vetting potential nominees for the various positions, as the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] process was ongoing (including recounts in some states where the winning margin was relatively tiny) and before the presidential [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]] in January 2017.\n\nPresident-elect Trump announced his first post-election Cabinet nominee, [[Jeff Sessions]] for the role of [[United States Attorney General]], on November 18, 2016.  (Trump had earlier announced Mike Pence as his pick for vice-presidential running mate in July 2016, which was shortly thereafter confirmed by the delegates to the [[2016 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] when they officially nominated first Trump and then Pence.)  Although most positions were simultaneously under consideration by the transition team, the official announcement of offers, and the public acceptance of the offers, usually happens gradually as slots are filled ([[Richard Nixon]] being the exception).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| President<ref name=foxnewsNomsByWeek>{{cite tweet|user=FoxNewsResearch|author=Fox News Research|number=798959647453544449|date=November 16, 2016|title=Since 1968, George HW Bush is the only president-elect to announce cabinet nominations within the first week after\u2026|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/graphics/how-donald-trumps-cabinet-nominations-compare-with-previous-presidents/|title=How Donald Trump's Cabinet Nominations Compare with Previous Presidents'|author=Randy Yeip|date=February 7, 2017|accessdate=February 7, 2017|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207114131/http://www.wsj.com/graphics/how-donald-trumps-cabinet-nominations-compare-with-previous-presidents/|archive-date=February 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=cqNomineeDates />\n! colspan=10| Week\n! rowspan=2| Weighted<br />Average\n! rowspan=2| Notes\n|-\n! 1\n! 2\n! 3\n! 4\n! 5\n! 6\n! 7\n! 8\n! 9\n! 10\n|-\n| [[Nixon cabinet and appointments|Nixon '68]]\n| <!-- wk1 -->\n| <!-- wk2 -->\n| <!-- wk3 -->\n| <!-- wk4 -->\n| <!-- wk5 -->\n| <!-- wk6 --> 12\n| <!-- wk7 -->\n| <!-- wk8 -->\n| <!-- wk9 -->\n| <!-- wk10-->\n| style=\"background:linen\" |<!-- avg --> 6.0 weeks\n| <!--notes--> The [[United States Postmaster General|twelfth Cabinet role]] was [[United States Postal Service|quasi-privatized]] in 1971.\n|-\n| [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter#Administration and cabinet|Carter '76]]\n| <!-- wk1 -->\n| <!-- wk2 -->\n| <!-- wk3 -->\n| <!-- wk4 -->\n| <!-- wk5 --> 1\n| <!-- wk6 --> 2\n| <!-- wk7 --> 7\n| <!-- wk8 --> 2\n| <!-- wk9 -->\n| <!-- wk10-->\n| style=\"background:linen\" |<!-- avg --> 6.8 weeks\n| <!--notes--> New roles:  [[United States Secretary of Energy|Energy]] in 1977, [[United States Department of Education|Education]] in 1979.\n|-\n| [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan#Administration and Cabinet|Reagan '80]]\n| <!-- wk1 -->\n| <!-- wk2 -->\n| <!-- wk3 -->\n| <!-- wk4 -->\n| <!-- wk5 -->\n| <!-- wk6 --> 8\n| <!-- wk7 --> 4\n| <!-- wk8 -->\n| <!-- wk9 -->\n| <!-- wk10--> 1\n| style=\"background:linen\" |<!-- avg --> 6.6 weeks\n| <!--notes--> Reagan was unable to [[United States Department of Education#Opposition|abolish the federal Department of Education]].\n|-\n| [[Presidency of George H.
