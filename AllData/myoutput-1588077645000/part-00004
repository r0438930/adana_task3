They are used for egg and meat production, as well as an ornamental bird.\n\n==History==\nThe Cayuga name is taken from [[Cayuga Lake]], one of the lakes in the [[Finger Lakes]] region of [[New York State]], where the breed was popularized. They are black with a green head.\n\nThis breed of duck is listed as threatened by the [[American Livestock Breeds Conservancy]].<ref>{{cite web |title = American Livestock Breeds Conservancy Watchlist |url = http://www.albc-usa.org/cpl/wtchlist.html#ducks |accessdate = 2008-03-25 }}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe Cayuga breed is in the Medium Class and has been a recognized breed of the [[American Poultry Association]] since 1874. The standard weight for adult males is {{cvt|8|lb}} and females {{cvt|7|lb}}. The Cayuga are characterized by a black [[Beak|bill]] and black [[plumage]], which is an iridescent beetle green in the correct light. In breeding, an emphasis is put on correct coloration, carriage, and a large breast. The Cayuga Duck has dark brown eyes, black shanks, and toes, except in old drakes where some orange shading may appear. Ducklings have black plumage. For exhibition presence of white color in the outer plumage is a disqualification. It is also well liked by many as a great yard pet as they tend to stay close to home.\n\nFor those who wish to keep ducks, but live close to others that would make keeping the [[American Pekin duck|Pekin]] breed impractical because of the loud quack, the Cayuga Duck may be an alternative. Its quack is not as loud except the females are quite vocal while often the male is mute. The temperament of the Cayuga is docile, and adult Cayuga Ducks enjoy eating snails, slugs, and most other insects.\n\nThe Cayuga Duck will more often sit on and hatch her eggs than other domestic breeds of duck. Incubation for the eggs is 28 days. When using an incubator the temperature should be {{cvt|99.5|F}} at 50-70% humidity for days 1\u201325, and {{cvt|99.1|F}} at 70-90% humidity for days 26\u201328.\n\n\nAnd dad that is why we should get ducks\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of duck breeds]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Cayuga duck}}\n\n[[Category:Duck breeds]]\n[[Category:Ducks]]\n[[Category:Duck breeds originating in the United States]]\n[[Category:Conservation Priority Breeds of the Livestock Conservancy]]\n[[Category:Animal breeds on the RBST Watchlist]]\n\n[[pt:Pato#H\u00edbridos]]\n", "text_old": "{{infobox poultry breed\n| name          = Cayuga Duck\n| image         = Cayuga drake 2012-05-02 001.jpg\n| image_size    =\n| alt           = \n| image_caption =A Cayuga drake\n| status        = \n| altname       =\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| distribution  =\n| standard      =\n| use           = Egg, meat and ornamental\n| nickname      =\n| apa           = Medium\n| aba           = \n| ee            = \n| pcgb          =Heavy<ref>{{cite web|title=Ducks: Heavy|url=http://www.poultryclub.org/breed-gallery/ducks/heavy-ducks/|publisher=The Poultry Club of Great Britain|accessdate=5 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114134241/http://www.poultryclub.org/breed-gallery/ducks/heavy-ducks/|archive-date=14 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| aps           =\n| maleweight    = 8 lbs\n| femaleweight  =7 lbs\n| skincolor     =\n| eggcolor      =\n| comb          =\n| note          = \n| type          = \n| latin         = Anas platyrhynchos domesticus\n}}\n[[File:Hausente1.jpg|thumb|right|Cayuga drake]]\n\nA '''Cayuga Duck''' is a medium-class [[domesticated duck]] breed that has been a popular variety in the USA since the mid-19th century.
