The image clearly symbolized a warrior arriving at a battle by air, the same tactics used by [[paratrooper]]s. The square upper-sleeve insignia comprised Bellerophon/Pegasus in light blue on a maroon background. One source suggests that the insignia was designed by famous English novelist [[Daphne du Maurier]], who was wife of the commander of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]] (and later the expanded British Airborne Forces), General [[Frederick Browning|Frederick \"Boy\" Browning]]. According to the British Army Website, the insignia was designed by the celebrated East Anglian painter Major [[Edward Seago]] in May 1942. The maroon background on the insignia was later used again by the Airborne Forces when they adopted the famous maroon beret in Summer 1942. The beret was the origin of the German nickname for British airborne troops, the [[Red Devils (Parachute Regiment)|Red Devils]]. Today's [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] carries on the maroon beret tradition. The selection process for the elite Parachute Regiment is called [[Pegasus Company]] (often abbreviated to \"P Company\"). In 2015 it was announced that the units of [[16 Air Assault Brigade]] would once again use the Pegasus insignia after a 15-year hiatus.<ref>{{cite news |last=Farmer |first=Ben |date=2015-10-22 |title=Paras win 15-year battle to reinstate Pegasus emblem |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/11945878/Paras-win-15-year-battle-to-reinstate-Pegasus-emblem.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=2018-03-21}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Operation Deadstick|airborne phase]] of the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]] on the night of 5\u20136 June 1944, [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 6th Airborne Division]] captured all its key objectives in advance of the seaborne assault, including the capture and holding at all costs of a vital bridge over the [[Canal de Caen \u00e0 la Mer|Caen Canal]], near [[Ouistreham]].

The image clearly symbolized a warrior arriving at a battle by air, the same tactics used by [[paratrooper]]s. The square upper-sleeve insignia comprised Bellerophon/Pegasus in light blue on a maroon background. One source suggests that the insignia was designed by famous English novelist [[Daphne du Maurier]], who was wife of the commander of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]] (and later the expanded British Airborne Forces), General [[Frederick Browning|Frederick \"Boy\" Browning]]. According to the British Army Website, the insignia was designed by the celebrated East Anglian painter Major [[Edward Seago]] in May 1942. The maroon background on the insignia was later used again by the Airborne Forces when they adopted the famous maroon beret in Summer 1942. The beret was the origin of the German nickname for British airborne troops, the [[Red Devils (Parachute Regiment)|Red Devils]]. Today's [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] carries on the maroon beret tradition. The selection process for the elite Parachute Regiment is called [[Pegasus Company]] (often abbreviated to \"P Company\"). In 2015 it was announced that the units of [[16 Air Assault Brigade]] would once again use the Pegasus insignia after a 15-year hiatus.<ref>{{cite news |last=Farmer |first=Ben |date=2015-10-22 |title=Paras win 15-year battle to reinstate Pegasus emblem |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/11945878/Paras-win-15-year-battle-to-reinstate-Pegasus-emblem.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=2018-03-21}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Operation Deadstick|airborne phase]] of the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]] on the night of 5\u20136 June 1944, [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 6th Airborne Division]] captured all its key objectives in advance of the seaborne assault, including the capture and holding at all costs of a vital bridge over the [[Canal de Caen \u00e0 la Mer|Caen Canal]], near [[Ouistreham]]. In memory of their tenacity, the bridge has been known ever since as [[Pegasus Bridge]].\n\nThe Tuscan [[National Liberation Committee]] during the German occupation of Italy also had a Pegasus as its emblem. The winged horse is still featured on the Tuscan flag and coat of arms.\n\n=== In popular culture ===\n{{Main|Pegasus in popular culture}}\nThe winged horse has provided an instantly recognizable corporate logo or emblem of inspiration.
