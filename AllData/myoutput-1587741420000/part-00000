When he bought the resort from Margaret Elardi and her family, it had been mired in a longtime strike, the longest running in American history, with employees represented by the [[Culinary Workers Union]], one of the most powerful labor organizations in Las Vegas. Ruffin settled the strike very soon after his purchase in 1998. Soon after, the casino-hotel became known as the New Frontier. In 2005, Ruffin announced plans to demolish the New Frontier and replace it in 2005 with a new resort to be called [[List of Las Vegas casinos that never opened#Montreaux Resort|The Montreaux]], but the development never got off the ground. Ruffin sold the New Frontier to [[El Ad Properties]] in 2007.

In 1987, he then used cash from the convenience stores to build his first hotel, a Marriott in Wichita. His businesses also included oil distribution and one of the country's largest manufacturers of hand trucks.<ref name=empire>{{cite news |last=Benston |first=Liz |title=An empire built on assets, not debt |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/apr/26/empire-built-assets-not-debt/ |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |newspaper=Las Vegas Sun |date=April 26, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Ruffin leased his convenience stores to [[Total S.A.|Total]], using the money to purchase more hotels.  Then, in 1995, Ruffin acquired the Crystal Palace casino resort in the [[Bahamas]]. Mortgaging the casino, Ruffin then purchased the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino]].<ref name=empire />\n\n===New Frontier Hotel and Casino===\nRuffin is best known for his purchase of the New Frontier Hotel and Casino, one of the [[Las Vegas Strip]]'s venerable properties. When he bought the resort from Margaret Elardi and her family, it had been mired in a longtime strike, the longest running in American history, with employees represented by the [[Culinary Workers Union]], one of the most powerful labor organizations in Las Vegas. Ruffin settled the strike very soon after his purchase in 1998. Soon after, the casino-hotel became known as the New Frontier. In 2005, Ruffin announced plans to demolish the New Frontier and replace it in 2005 with a new resort to be called [[List of Las Vegas casinos that never opened#Montreaux Resort|The Montreaux]], but the development never got off the ground. Ruffin sold the New Frontier to [[El Ad Properties]] in 2007.

Wagle had long opposed expansion of alternate forms of gambling in Kansas. Six months after receiving a contribution of $1,000 to her 2018 state senate campaign from Ruffin, the owner of Kansas racehorse and greyhound tracks, she reversed her position.
