On [[Earth]], clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its [[dew point]], or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of [[water vapor]]) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature.\n\nThey are seen in the Earth's [[homosphere]] (which includes the [[troposphere]], [[stratosphere]], and [[mesosphere]]). Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the [[cloud physics]] branch of [[meteorology]].\n\nThe two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the atmosphere are Latin and common. Cloud types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth's surface, have [[Latin]] names due to the universal adoption of [[Luke Howard]]'s [[nomenclature]]. Formally proposed in 1802, it became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical ''forms'' that appear in any or all of three altitude ''levels'' (formerly known as [[Etage|''\u00e9tages'']]). These physical types, in approximate ascending order of convective activity, include ''stratiform'' sheets, ''cirriform'' wisps and patches, ''stratocumuliform'' layers (mainly structured as rolls, ripples, and patches), ''cumuliform'' heaps, and very large ''cumulonimbiform'' heaps that often show complex structures. The physical forms are divided by altitude levels into 10 basic genus-types.\n\nThe Latin names for applicable ''high-level'' genera in the troposphere carry a ''cirro''- prefix, and an ''alto''- prefix is added to the names of the ''mid-level'' genus-types. Clouds with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one altitude level are officially classified as ''low-'' or ''mid-level'' according to the altitude range at which each initially forms. However they are also more informally classified as ''multi-level'' or ''vertical'', which along with low level clouds, do not carry any altitude related prefixes. Most of the genera can be subdivided into ''species'' and further subdivided into ''varieties''. Very low stratiform clouds that extend down to the Earth's surface are given the common names fog and mist, but have no Latin names.\n\nSeveral cloud types that form higher up in the stratosphere and mesosphere have common names for their main types, which may have the appearance of stratiform sheets, cirriform wisps, or stratocumuliform bands or ripples. They are seen infrequently, mostly in the polar regions of Earth. Clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other [[planet]]s and [[Natural satellite|moons]] in the [[Solar System]] and beyond. However, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are often composed of other substances such as [[methane]], [[ammonia]], and [[sulfuric acid]], as well as water.\n\nThe tabular overview that follows is very broad in scope. It draws from several methods of cloud classification, both formal and informal, used in different levels of the Earth's homosphere by a number of cited authorities. Despite some differences in methodologies and terminologies, the classification schemes seen in this article can be harmonized by using an informal cross-classification of physical forms and altitude levels to derive the 10 tropospheric genera, the fog and mist that forms at surface level, and several additional major types above the troposphere. The cumulus genus includes four species that indicate vertical size and structure which can affect both forms and levels. This table should not be seen as a strict or singular classification, but as an illustration of how various major cloud types are related to each other and defined through a full range of altitude levels from Earth's surface to the \"edge of space\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Forms and levels !!

Around the beginning of the 13th century, the word came to be used as a metaphor for rain clouds, because of the similarity in appearance between a mass of rock and cumulus heap cloud. Over time, the metaphoric usage of the word supplanted the Old English ''weolcan'', which had been the literal term for clouds in general.<ref name=Harper>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cloud |title=Cloud |author=Harper, Douglas |year=2012 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cloud |title=Cloud |website=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Aristotle ===\n\nAncient cloud studies were not made in isolation, but were observed in combination with other [[weather]] elements and even other natural sciences. Around 340 BC, Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] wrote ''[[Meteorologica]]'', a work which represented the sum of knowledge of the time about natural science, including weather and climate. For the first time, precipitation and the clouds from which precipitation fell were called meteors, which originate from the Greek word ''meteoros'', meaning 'high in the sky'. From that word came the modern term [[meteorology]], the study of clouds and weather. ''Meteorologica'' was based on intuition and simple observation, but not on what is now considered the scientific method. Nevertheless, it was the first known work that attempted to treat a broad range of meteorological topics in a systematic way, especially the [[hydrological cycle]].<ref name=\"Meteorologica\">{{cite journal |last=Frisinger |first=H.

Howard was a methodical observer with a strong grounding in the Latin language, and used his background to classify the various tropospheric cloud types during 1802. He believed that the changing cloud forms in the sky could unlock the key to weather forecasting. Lamarck had worked independently on cloud classification the same year and had come up with a different naming scheme that failed to make an impression even in his home country of [[France]] because it used unusual French names for cloud types. His system of nomenclature included 12 categories of clouds, with such names as (translated from French) hazy clouds, dappled clouds, and broom-like clouds. By contrast, Howard used universally accepted Latin, which caught on quickly after it was published in 1803.<ref name=\"Preface\">{{cite book |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=International Cloud Atlas, preface to the 1939 edition |volume=I |year=1975 |url=https://archive.org/details/manualonobservat00worl/page/ |pages=[https://archive.org/details/manualonobservat00worl/page/ IX\u2013XIII] |isbn=978-92-63-10407-6 |accessdate=6 December 2014 }}</ref> As a sign of the popularity of the naming scheme, German dramatist and poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] composed four poems about clouds, dedicating them to Howard.

''Virga'' is a feature seen with clouds producing precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground, these being of the genera cirrocumulus, altocumulus, altostratus, nimbostratus, stratocumulus, cumulus, and cumulonimbus.<ref name=\"features\"/>\n\nWhen the precipitation reaches the ground without completely evaporating, it is designated as the feature ''praecipitatio''.<ref name=\"Dunlop77-78\">{{harvnb|Dunlop|2003|pp=77\u201378}}</ref> This normally occurs with altostratus opacus, which can produce widespread but usually light precipitation, and with thicker clouds that show significant vertical development. Of the latter, ''upward-growing'' cumulus mediocris produces only isolated light showers, while ''downward growing'' nimbostratus is capable of heavier, more extensive precipitation. Towering vertical clouds have the greatest ability to produce intense precipitation events, but these tend to be localized unless organized along fast-moving cold fronts. Showers of moderate to heavy intensity can fall from cumulus congestus clouds. Cumulonimbus, the largest of all cloud genera, has the capacity to produce very heavy showers. Low stratus clouds usually produce only light precipitation, but this always occurs as the feature praecipitatio due to the fact this cloud genus lies too close to the ground to allow for the formation of virga.<ref name=\"clouds - species and varieties\"/><ref name=\"Aerographer2012\"/><ref name=\"features\"/>\n\n====Cloud-based supplementary features====\n''Incus'' is the most type-specific supplementary feature, seen only with cumulonimbus of the species capillatus.

The supplementary feature ''cavum'' is a circular fall-streak hole that occasionally forms in a thin layer of supercooled altocumulus or cirrocumulus. Fall streaks consisting of virga or wisps of cirrus are usually seen beneath the hole as ice crystals fall out to a lower altitude. This type of hole is usually larger than typical lacunosus holes. A ''murus'' feature is a cumulonimbus wall cloud with a lowering, rotating cloud base than can lead to the development of tornadoes. A ''cauda'' feature is a tail cloud that extends horizontally away from the murus cloud and is the result of air feeding into the storm.<ref name=ICA2017/>\n\n====Accessory clouds====\nSupplementary cloud formations detached from the main cloud are known as [[accessory cloud]]s.<ref name=\"clouds - species and varieties\"/><ref name=\"Aerographer2012\"/><ref name=\"features\"/> The heavier precipitating clouds, nimbostratus, towering cumulus (cumulus congestus), and cumulonimbus typically see the formation in precipitation of the ''pannus'' feature, low ragged clouds of the genera and species cumulus fractus or stratus fractus.<ref name=\"pannus\"/>\n\nA group of accessory clouds comprise formations that are associated mainly with upward-growing cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds of free convection.

It is formed by the warm, humid [[inflow (meteorology)|inflow]] of a super-cell thunderstorm, and can be mistaken for a tornado. Although the flumen can indicate a tornado risk, it is similar in appearance to pannus or [[scud (cloud)|scud]] clouds and does not rotate.<ref name=ICA2017/>\n\n==== Mother clouds ====\n[[File:Port of Piraeus Panoramic View.JPG|left|thumb|Cumulus partly spreading into stratocumulus cumulogenitus over the port of [[Piraeus]] in Greece ]]\n\nClouds initially form in clear air or become clouds when fog rises above surface level. The genus of a newly formed cloud is determined mainly by air mass characteristics such as stability and moisture content. If these characteristics change over time, the genus tends to change accordingly. When this happens, the original genus is called a ''mother cloud''. If the mother cloud retains much of its original form after the appearance of the new genus, it is termed a ''genitus'' cloud. One example of this is ''stratocumulus cumulogenitus'', a stratocumulus cloud formed by the partial spreading of a cumulus type when there is a loss of convective lift. If the mother cloud undergoes a complete change in genus, it is considered to be a ''mutatus'' cloud.<ref name=\"mother-clouds\">{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Mother clouds, International Cloud Atlas|year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/principles-of-cloud-classification-mother-clouds.html|accessdate=2 June 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Sunset and Clouds.jpg|thumb|Cumulonimbus mother cloud dissipating into stratocumulus cumulonimbogenitus at dusk]]\n\n====Other genitus and mutatus clouds====\n\nThe genitus and mutatus categories have been expanded to include certain types that do not originate from pre-existing clouds. The term ''flammagenitus'' (Latin for 'fire-made') applies to cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that are formed by large scale fires or volcanic eruptions. Smaller low-level \"pyrocumulus\" or \"fumulus\" clouds formed by contained industrial activity are now classified as cumulus ''homogenitus'' (Latin for 'man-made'). [[Contrail]]s formed from the exhaust of aircraft flying in the upper level of the troposphere can persist and spread into formations resembling cirrus which are designated cirrus ''homogenitus''.  If a cirrus homogenitus cloud changes fully to any of the high-level genera, they are termed cirrus, cirrostratus, or cirrocumulus ''homomutatus''. Stratus cataractagenitus (Latin for 'cataract-made') are generated by the spray from waterfalls. ''Silvagenitus'' (Latin for 'forest-made') is a stratus cloud that forms as water vapor is added to the air above a forest canopy.<ref name=\"mother-clouds\"/>\n\n==== Stratocumulus fields ====\nStratocumulus clouds can be organized into \"fields\" that take on certain specially classified shapes and characteristics. In general, these fields are more discernible from high altitudes than from ground level.

However, a thick dense ice-crystal cloud appears brilliant white with pronounced grey shading because of its greater reflectivity.<ref name=\"Luminance\"/>\n\nAs a tropospheric cloud matures, the dense water droplets may combine to produce larger droplets. If the droplets become too large and heavy to be kept aloft by the air circulation, they will fall from the cloud as [[rain]]. By this process of accumulation, the space between droplets becomes increasingly larger, permitting light to penetrate farther into the cloud. If the cloud is sufficiently large and the droplets within are spaced far enough apart, a percentage of the light that enters the cloud is not reflected back out but is absorbed giving the cloud a darker look. A simple example of this is one's being able to see farther in heavy rain than in heavy fog. This process of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]/[[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] is what causes the range of cloud color from white to black.<ref name=\"Bette Hileman\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cen-v073n007.p033| title = Clouds absorb more solar radiation than researchers previously thought| journal = Chemical & Engineering News| volume = 73| issue = 7| pages = 33| year = 1995| last1 = Hileman | first1 = B. }}</ref>\n\nStriking cloud colorations can be seen at any altitude, with the color of a cloud usually being the same as the incident light.<ref name=\"Coloration\">{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Coloration, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/appearance-of-clouds-colour.html |accessdate=13 May 2017}}</ref> During daytime when the sun is relatively high in the sky, tropospheric clouds generally appear bright white on top with varying shades of grey underneath. Thin clouds may look white or appear to have acquired the color of their [[Natural environment|environment]] or background. Red, orange, and pink clouds occur almost entirely at sunrise/sunset and are the result of the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere. When the sun is just below the horizon, low-level clouds are gray, middle clouds appear rose-colored, and high clouds are white or off-white. Clouds at night are black or dark grey in a moonless sky, or whitish when illuminated by the moon. They may also reflect the colors of large fires, city lights, or auroras that might be present.<ref name=\"Coloration\"/>\n\nA cumulonimbus cloud that appears to have a greenish or bluish tint is a sign that it contains extremely high amounts of water; hail or rain which scatter light in a way that gives the cloud a blue color. A green colorization occurs mostly late in the day when the sun is comparatively low in the sky and the incident sunlight has a reddish tinge that appears green when illuminating a very tall bluish cloud. Supercell type storms are more likely to be characterized by this but any storm can appear this way. Coloration such as this does not directly indicate that it is a severe thunderstorm, it only confirms its potential. Since a green/blue tint signifies copious amounts of water, a strong updraft to support it, high winds from the storm raining out, and wet hail; all elements that improve the chance for it to become severe, can all be inferred from this. In addition, the stronger the updraft is, the more likely the storm is to undergo tornadogenesis and to produce large hail and high winds.<ref name=\"Curiosities\">{{cite web |editor=University of Wisconsen-Madison-News |title= Curiosities-Green sky before tornado |year=2007 |url= http://www.news.wisc.edu/14039|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nYellowish clouds may be seen in the troposphere in the late spring through early fall months during [[Wildfire|forest fire]] season.

First and foremost, they are the source of precipitation, thereby greatly influencing the distribution and amount of precipitation. Because of their differential buoyancy relative to surrounding cloud-free air, clouds can be associated with vertical motions of the air that may be convective, frontal, or cyclonic. The motion is upward if the clouds are less dense because condensation of water vapor releases heat, warming the air and thereby decreasing its density. This can lead to downward motion because lifting of the air results in cooling that increases its density. All of these effects are subtly dependent on the vertical temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere and result in major redistribution of heat that affect the Earth's climate.<ref name=\"cloud-heating\"/>\n\nThe complexity and diversity of clouds in the troposphere is a major reason for difficulty in quantifying the effects of clouds on climate and climate change. On the one hand, white cloud tops promote cooling of Earth's surface by reflecting shortwave radiation (visible and near infrared) from the sun, diminishing the amount of solar radiation that is absorbed at the surface, enhancing the Earth's [[albedo]]. Most of the sunlight that reaches the ground is absorbed, warming the surface, which emits radiation upward at longer, infrared, wavelengths. At these wavelengths, however, water in the clouds acts as an efficient absorber. The water reacts by radiating, also in the infrared, both upward and downward, and the downward longwave radiation results in increased warming at the surface. This is analogous to the [[greenhouse effect]] of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[water vapor]].<ref name=\"cloud-heating\">{{cite web|url=http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/role.html|title=Cloud Climatology|website=International Satellite Cloud Climatology Program|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nHigh-level genus-types particularly show this duality with both short-wave [[albedo]] cooling and long-wave greenhouse warming effects. On the whole, ''ice-crystal'' clouds in the upper troposphere (cirrus) tend to favor net warming.<ref name=\"Clouds and the greenhouse effect\"/><ref name=\"Nucleation\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsta.2002.1141|pmid=12662454| title = Nucleation of ice and its management in ecosystems| journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences| volume = 361| issue = 1804| pages = 557\u201374 | year = 2003| last1 = Franks | first1 = F.|bibcode=2003RSPTA.361..557F}}</ref> However, the cooling effect is dominant with mid-level and low clouds, especially when they form in extensive sheets.<ref name=\"Clouds and the greenhouse effect\"/> Measurements by NASA indicate that on the whole, the effects of low and mid-level clouds that tend to promote cooling outweigh the warming effects of high layers and the variable outcomes associated with vertically developed clouds.<ref name=\"Clouds and the greenhouse effect\">[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 124</ref>\n\nAs difficult as it is to evaluate the influences of current clouds on current climate, it is even more problematic to predict changes in cloud patterns and properties in a future, warmer climate, and the resultant cloud influences on future climate. In a warmer climate more water would enter the atmosphere by evaporation at the surface; as clouds are formed from water vapor, cloudiness would be expected to increase. But in a warmer climate, higher temperatures would tend to evaporate clouds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/cloud-loss-could-add-8-degrees-to-global-warming-20190225/|title=A World Without Clouds|first=Natalie|last=Wolchover|website=Quanta Magazine}}</ref> Both of these statements are considered accurate, and both phenomena, known as cloud feedbacks, are found in climate model calculations. Broadly speaking, if clouds, especially low clouds, increase in a warmer climate, the resultant cooling effect leads to a negative feedback in climate response to increased greenhouse gases. But if low clouds decrease, or if high clouds increase, the feedback is positive. Differing amounts of these feedbacks are the principal reason for differences in [[Climate sensitivity|climate sensitivities]] of current global climate models. As a consequence, much research has focused on the response of low and vertical clouds to a changing climate. Leading global models produce quite different results, however, with some showing increasing low clouds and others showing decreases.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2005GL023851| title = Marine boundary layer clouds at the heart of tropical cloud feedback uncertainties in climate models| journal = Geophysical Research Letters| volume = 32| issue = 20| pages = L20806| year = 2005| last1 = Bony | first1 = S. |bibcode = 2005GeoRL..3220806B }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1175/2008JCLI1995.1| title = Aquaplanets, Climate Sensitivity, and Low Clouds| journal = Journal of Climate| volume = 21| issue = 19| pages = 4974\u20134991| year = 2008| last1 = Medeiros | first1 = B. | last2 = Stevens | first2 = B. | last3 = Held | first3 = I.

On [[Earth]], clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its [[dew point]], or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of [[water vapor]]) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature.\n\nThey are seen in the Earth's [[homosphere]] (which includes the [[troposphere]], [[stratosphere]], and [[mesosphere]]). Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the [[cloud physics]] branch of [[meteorology]].\n\nThe two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the atmosphere are Latin and common. Cloud types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth's surface, have [[Latin]] names due to the universal adoption of [[Luke Howard]]'s [[nomenclature]]. Formally proposed in 1802, it became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical ''forms'' that appear in any or all of three altitude ''levels'' (formerly known as [[Etage|''\u00e9tages'']]). These physical types, in approximate ascending order of convective activity, include ''stratiform'' sheets, ''cirriform'' wisps and patches, ''stratocumuliform'' layers (mainly structured as rolls, ripples, and patches), ''cumuliform'' heaps, and very large ''cumulonimbiform'' heaps that often show complex structures. The physical forms are divided by altitude levels into 10 basic genus-types.\n\nThe Latin names for applicable ''high-level'' genera in the troposphere carry a ''cirro''- prefix, and an ''alto''- prefix is added to the names of the ''mid-level'' genus-types. Clouds with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one altitude level are officially classified as ''low-'' or ''mid-level'' according to the altitude range at which each initially forms. However they are also more informally classified as ''multi-level'' or ''vertical'', which along with low level clouds, do not carry any altitude related prefixes. Most of the genera can be subdivided into ''species'' and further subdivided into ''varieties''. Very low stratiform clouds that extend down to the Earth's surface are given the common names fog and mist, but have no Latin names.\n\nSeveral cloud types that form higher up in the stratosphere and mesosphere have common names for their main types, which may have the appearance of stratiform sheets, cirriform wisps, or stratocumuliform bands or ripples. They are seen infrequently, mostly in the polar regions of Earth. Clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other [[planet]]s and [[Natural satellite|moons]] in the [[Solar System]] and beyond. However, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are often composed of other substances such as [[methane]], [[ammonia]], and [[sulfuric acid]], as well as water.\n\nThe tabular overview that follows is very broad in scope. It draws from several methods of cloud classification, both formal and informal, used in different levels of the Earth's homosphere by a number of cited authorities. Despite some differences in methodologies and terminologies, the classification schemes seen in this article can be harmonized by using an informal cross-classification of physical forms and altitude levels to derive the 10 tropospheric genera, the fog and mist that forms at surface level, and several additional major types above the troposphere. The cumulus genus includes four species that indicate vertical size and structure which can affect both forms and levels. This table should not be seen as a strict or singular classification, but as an illustration of how various major cloud types are related to each other and defined through a full range of altitude levels from Earth's surface to the \"edge of space\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Forms and levels !!

Around the beginning of the 13th century, the word came to be used as a metaphor for rain clouds, because of the similarity in appearance between a mass of rock and cumulus heap cloud. Over time, the metaphoric usage of the word supplanted the Old English ''weolcan'', which had been the literal term for clouds in general.<ref name=Harper>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cloud |title=Cloud |author=Harper, Douglas |year=2012 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cloud |title=Cloud |website=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Aristotle ===\n\nAncient cloud studies were not made in isolation, but were observed in combination with other [[weather]] elements and even other natural sciences. Around 340 BC, Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] wrote ''[[Meteorologica]]'', a work which represented the sum of knowledge of the time about natural science, including weather and climate. For the first time, precipitation and the clouds from which precipitation fell were called meteors, which originate from the Greek word ''meteoros'', meaning 'high in the sky'. From that word came the modern term [[meteorology]], the study of clouds and weather. ''Meteorologica'' was based on intuition and simple observation, but not on what is now considered the scientific method. Nevertheless, it was the first known work that attempted to treat a broad range of meteorological topics in a systematic way, especially the [[hydrological cycle]].<ref name=\"Meteorologica\">{{cite journal |last=Frisinger |first=H.

Howard was a methodical observer with a strong grounding in the Latin language, and used his background to classify the various tropospheric cloud types during 1802. He believed that the changing cloud forms in the sky could unlock the key to weather forecasting. Lamarck had worked independently on cloud classification the same year and had come up with a different naming scheme that failed to make an impression even in his home country of [[France]] because it used unusual French names for cloud types. His system of nomenclature included 12 categories of clouds, with such names as (translated from French) hazy clouds, dappled clouds, and broom-like clouds. By contrast, Howard used universally accepted Latin, which caught on quickly after it was published in 1803.<ref name=\"Preface\">{{cite book |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=International Cloud Atlas, preface to the 1939 edition |volume=I |year=1975 |url=https://archive.org/details/manualonobservat00worl/page/ |pages=[https://archive.org/details/manualonobservat00worl/page/ IX\u2013XIII] |isbn=978-92-63-10407-6 |accessdate=6 December 2014 }}</ref> As a sign of the popularity of the naming scheme, German dramatist and poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] composed four poems about clouds, dedicating them to Howard.

Despite this hierarchy, a particular species may be a subtype of more than one genus, especially if the genera are of the same physical form and are differentiated from each other mainly by altitude or level.

Towering vertical clouds have the greatest ability to produce intense precipitation events, but these tend to be localized unless organized along fast-moving cold fronts. Showers of moderate to heavy intensity can fall from cumulus congestus clouds. Cumulonimbus, the largest of all cloud genera, has the capacity to produce very heavy showers.

This phenomenon has also been observed in cloud formations over other planets and even in the sun's atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fox|first=Karen C.|title=NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory Catches \"Surfer\" Waves on the Sun|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/sun-surfing.html|website=NASA-The Sun-Earth Connection: Heliophysics|publisher=NASA}}</ref> Another highly disturbed but more chaotic wave-like cloud feature associated with stratocumulus or altocumulus cloud has been given the Latin name ''asperitas''. The supplementary feature ''cavum'' is a circular fall-streak hole that occasionally forms in a thin layer of supercooled altocumulus or cirrocumulus. Fall streaks consisting of virga or wisps of cirrus are usually seen beneath the hole as ice crystals fall out to a lower altitude. This type of hole is usually larger than typical lacunosus holes. A ''murus'' feature is a cumulonimbus wall cloud with a lowering, rotating cloud base than can lead to the development of tornadoes.

It is formed by the warm, humid [[inflow (meteorology)|inflow]] of a super-cell thunderstorm, and can be mistaken for a tornado. Although the flumen can indicate a tornado risk, it is similar in appearance to pannus or [[scud (cloud)|scud]] clouds and does not rotate.<ref name=ICA2017/>\n\n==== Mother clouds ====\n[[File:Port of Piraeus Panoramic View.JPG|left|thumb|Cumulus partly spreading into stratocumulus cumulogenitus over the port of [[Piraeus]] in Greece ]]\n\nClouds initially form in clear air or become clouds when fog rises above surface level. The genus of a newly formed cloud is determined mainly by air mass characteristics such as stability and moisture content. If these characteristics change over time, the genus tends to change accordingly. When this happens, the original genus is called a ''mother cloud''. If the mother cloud retains much of its original form after the appearance of the new genus, it is termed a ''genitus'' cloud. One example of this is ''stratocumulus cumulogenitus'', a stratocumulus cloud formed by the partial spreading of a cumulus type when there is a loss of convective lift. If the mother cloud undergoes a complete change in genus, it is considered to be a ''mutatus'' cloud.<ref name=\"mother-clouds\">{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Mother clouds, International Cloud Atlas|year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/principles-of-cloud-classification-mother-clouds.html|accessdate=2 June 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Sunset and Clouds.jpg|thumb|Cumulonimbus mother cloud dissipating into stratocumulus cumulonimbogenitus at dusk]]\n\n====Other genitus and mutatus clouds====\n\nThe genitus and mutatus categories have been expanded to include certain types that do not originate from pre-existing clouds. The term ''flammagenitus'' (Latin for 'fire-made') applies to cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that are formed by large scale fires or volcanic eruptions. Smaller low-level \"pyrocumulus\" or \"fumulus\" clouds formed by contained industrial activity are now classified as cumulus ''homogenitus'' (Latin for 'man-made'). [[Contrail]]s formed from the exhaust of aircraft flying in the upper level of the troposphere can persist and spread into formations resembling cirrus which are designated cirrus ''homogenitus''.  If a cirrus homogenitus cloud changes fully to any of the high-level genera, they are termed cirrus, cirrostratus, or cirrocumulus ''homomutatus''. Stratus cataractagenitus (Latin for 'cataract-made') are generated by the spray from waterfalls. ''Silvagenitus'' (Latin for 'forest-made') is a stratus cloud that forms as water vapor is added to the air above a forest canopy.<ref name=\"mother-clouds\"/>\n\n==== Stratocumulus fields ====\nStratocumulus clouds can be organized into \"fields\" that take on certain specially classified shapes and characteristics. In general, these fields are more discernible from high altitudes than from ground level.

As a result, the [[cloud base]] can vary from a very light to very-dark-grey depending on the cloud's thickness and how much [[light]] is being reflected or transmitted back to the observer. High thin tropospheric clouds reflect less light because of the comparatively low concentration of constituent ice crystals or supercooled water droplets which results in a slightly off-white appearance. However, a thick dense ice-crystal cloud appears brilliant white with pronounced grey shading because of its greater reflectivity.<ref name=\"Luminance\"/>\n\nAs a tropospheric cloud matures, the dense water droplets may combine to produce larger droplets. If the droplets become too large and heavy to be kept aloft by the air circulation, they will fall from the cloud as [[rain]]. By this process of accumulation, the space between droplets becomes increasingly larger, permitting light to penetrate farther into the cloud. If the cloud is sufficiently large and the droplets within are spaced far enough apart, a percentage of the light that enters the cloud is not reflected back out but is absorbed giving the cloud a darker look. A simple example of this is one's being able to see farther in heavy rain than in heavy fog. This process of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]/[[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] is what causes the range of cloud color from white to black.<ref name=\"Bette Hileman\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cen-v073n007.p033| title = Clouds absorb more solar radiation than researchers previously thought| journal = Chemical & Engineering News| volume = 73| issue = 7| pages = 33| year = 1995| last1 = Hileman | first1 = B. }}</ref>\n\nStriking cloud colorations can be seen at any altitude, with the color of a cloud usually being the same as the incident light.<ref name=\"Coloration\">{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Coloration, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/appearance-of-clouds-colour.html |accessdate=13 May 2017}}</ref> During daytime when the sun is relatively high in the sky, tropospheric clouds generally appear bright white on top with varying shades of grey underneath. Thin clouds may look white or appear to have acquired the color of their [[Natural environment|environment]] or background. Red, orange, and pink clouds occur almost entirely at sunrise/sunset and are the result of the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere. When the sun is just below the horizon, low-level clouds are gray, middle clouds appear rose-colored, and high clouds are white or off-white. Clouds at night are black or dark grey in a moonless sky, or whitish when illuminated by the moon. They may also reflect the colors of large fires, city lights, or auroras that might be present.<ref name=\"Coloration\"/>\n\nA cumulonimbus cloud that appears to have a greenish or bluish tint is a sign that it contains extremely high amounts of water; hail or rain which scatter light in a way that gives the cloud a blue color. A green colorization occurs mostly late in the day when the sun is comparatively low in the sky and the incident sunlight has a reddish tinge that appears green when illuminating a very tall bluish cloud. Supercell type storms are more likely to be characterized by this but any storm can appear this way. Coloration such as this does not directly indicate that it is a severe thunderstorm, it only confirms its potential. Since a green/blue tint signifies copious amounts of water, a strong updraft to support it, high winds from the storm raining out, and wet hail; all elements that improve the chance for it to become severe, can all be inferred from this. In addition, the stronger the updraft is, the more likely the storm is to undergo tornadogenesis and to produce large hail and high winds.<ref name=\"Curiosities\">{{cite web |editor=University of Wisconsen-Madison-News |title= Curiosities-Green sky before tornado |year=2007 |url= http://www.news.wisc.edu/14039|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nYellowish clouds may be seen in the troposphere in the late spring through early fall months during [[Wildfire|forest fire]] season.

First and foremost, they are the source of precipitation, thereby greatly influencing the distribution and amount of precipitation. Because of their differential buoyancy relative to surrounding cloud-free air, clouds can be associated with vertical motions of the air that may be convective, frontal, or cyclonic. The motion is upward if the clouds are less dense because condensation of water vapor releases heat, warming the air and thereby decreasing its density. This can lead to downward motion because lifting of the air results in cooling that increases its density. All of these effects are subtly dependent on the vertical temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere and result in major redistribution of heat that affect the Earth's climate.<ref name=\"cloud-heating\"/>\n\nThe complexity and diversity of clouds in the troposphere is a major reason for difficulty in quantifying the effects of clouds on climate and climate change. On the one hand, white cloud tops promote cooling of Earth's surface by reflecting shortwave radiation (visible and near infrared) from the sun, diminishing the amount of solar radiation that is absorbed at the surface, enhancing the Earth's [[albedo]]. Most of the sunlight that reaches the ground is absorbed, warming the surface, which emits radiation upward at longer, infrared, wavelengths. At these wavelengths, however, water in the clouds acts as an efficient absorber. The water reacts by radiating, also in the infrared, both upward and downward, and the downward longwave radiation results in increased warming at the surface. This is analogous to the [[greenhouse effect]] of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[water vapor]].<ref name=\"cloud-heating\">{{cite web|url=http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/role.html|title=Cloud Climatology|website=International Satellite Cloud Climatology Program|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nHigh-level genus-types particularly show this duality with both short-wave [[albedo]] cooling and long-wave greenhouse warming effects.

In a warmer climate more water would enter the atmosphere by evaporation at the surface; as clouds are formed from water vapor, cloudiness would be expected to increase. But in a warmer climate, higher temperatures would tend to evaporate clouds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/cloud-loss-could-add-8-degrees-to-global-warming-20190225/|title=A World Without Clouds|first=Natalie|last=Wolchover|website=Quanta Magazine}}</ref> Both of these statements are considered accurate, and both phenomena, known as cloud feedbacks, are found in climate model calculations. Broadly speaking, if clouds, especially low clouds, increase in a warmer climate, the resultant cooling effect leads to a negative feedback in climate response to increased greenhouse gases. But if low clouds decrease, or if high clouds increase, the feedback is positive. Differing amounts of these feedbacks are the principal reason for differences in [[Climate sensitivity|climate sensitivities]] of current global climate models. As a consequence, much research has focused on the response of low and vertical clouds to a changing climate. Leading global models produce quite different results, however, with some showing increasing low clouds and others showing decreases.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2005GL023851| title = Marine boundary layer clouds at the heart of tropical cloud feedback uncertainties in climate models| journal = Geophysical Research Letters| volume = 32| issue = 20| pages = L20806| year = 2005| last1 = Bony | first1 = S. |bibcode = 2005GeoRL..3220806B }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1175/2008JCLI1995.1| title = Aquaplanets, Climate Sensitivity, and Low Clouds| journal = Journal of Climate| volume = 21| issue = 19| pages = 4974\u20134991| year = 2008| last1 = Medeiros | first1 = B. | last2 = Stevens | first2 = B. | last3 = Held | first3 = I.

Noctilucent clouds may occasionally take on more of a red or orange hue.<ref name=\"Polar-stratospheric\"/> They are not common or widespread enough to have a significant effect on climate.<ref name=\"simulation studies\"/> However, an increasing frequency of occurrence of noctilucent clouds since the 19th century may be the result of climate change.<ref name=\"noctilucent-cloud\">{{cite web |editor=Project Possum|title=About Noctiluent Clouds|year=2017 |url=http://projectpossum.org/research/noctilucent-cloud/about-noctilucent-clouds/|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nNoctilucent clouds are the highest in the atmosphere and form near the top of the mesosphere at about ten times the altitude of tropospheric high clouds.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|author1=Michael Gadsden|author2=Pekka Parviainen|title=Observing Noctilucent Clouds|date=September 2006|publisher=International Association of Geomagnetism & Aeronomy|url=http://www.iugg.org/IAGA/iaga_pages/pdf/ONC_Sep06.pdf|page=9|accessdate=31 January 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031003710/http://www.iugg.org/IAGA/iaga_pages/pdf/ONC_Sep06.pdf|archivedate=31 October 2008}}</ref> From ground level, they can occasionally be seen illuminated by the sun during deep [[twilight]]. Ongoing research indicates that convective lift in the mesosphere is strong enough during the polar [[summer]] to cause adiabatic cooling of small amount of water vapour to the point of saturation. This tends to produce the coldest temperatures in the entire atmosphere just below the mesopause. These conditions result in the best environment for the formation of polar mesospheric clouds.<ref name=\"simulation studies\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Turco | first1 = R.

Because of the need for maximum cooling of the water vapor to produce noctilucent clouds, their distribution tends to be restricted to polar regions of Earth. A major seasonal difference is that convective lift from below the mesosphere pushes very scarce water vapor to higher colder altitudes required for cloud formation during the respective summer seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Sightings are rare more than 45 degrees south of the north pole or north of the south pole.<ref name=\"Polar-stratospheric\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Extraterrestrial ==\n{{See also|Extraterrestrial atmospheres}}\nCloud cover has been seen on most other planets in the [[Solar System]].
