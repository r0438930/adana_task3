In the kitchen awaits her two daughters and their father. The daughters and the father leave to go to his house, where his wife, Lorraine Farris, is preparing for her campaign to become counsellor. It is at this point, one sees a little inkling into the sinister character behind Dr. Farris.\n\nUpon his wife being elected counsellor, Dr. Farris can be seen as visibly disturbed by the relationship between his wife Loraine and her colleague. Shortly after that, his wife is seen as  becoming ill, with similar symptoms to that of his ex-wife. At this point, Ellen starts to become concerned for her health and pleads with her ex-husband to seek help for Lorraine, as he did, to find out the cause of her illness. At this point, from what Ellen is suffering is still unknown.\n\nAfter his wife suffers more serious episodes and his ex-wife again pleads with him, Dr. Farris takes their son (by Lorraine) Graham and her to Mexico to get her treated. On return, Ellen informs Dr. Farris and Lorraine that she found out she had [[selenium poisoning]] due to ingesting pure selenium (which is also found in some health supplements). Ellen then asks Lorraine to get tested for the same thing, which she promises to do. Dr Farris can also be seen throughout the movie to write a computerized journal about his personal life, which shows how distraught he is under his caring and loving persona.\n\nHowever, just 3 weeks later, Lorraine drops dead at home in front of Graham and is then quickly cremated by David. The pathologist initially is not able to find any signs of foul play except the faint smell of chlorine when he opened her up during autopsy. Dr. Farris has applied for a marriage license and subsequently gets married to a woman he met at his wife's election celebration. This course of action places a great level of suspicion on him. \nWith the help of his ex-wife, the police look into the conditions surrounding Lorraine's death, and after the examination of Ellen Farris further, they find out that she is suffering from kidney failure. He was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. It was also revealed that Lorraine died of cyanide poisoning, to which he switched after Mexico to speed up the effects of selenium (i.e. death) - it was initially missed due to a chlorine smell, and Dr. Farris was believed to have forced his wife to swallow a water supplement pill shortly before her death to mask the prominent smell of cyanide - hence the chlorine smell.\n\nThe motive behind these acts was jealousy and the desire to get rid of his wife; he poisoned his first wife to leave her for his second, Lorraine, with whom he was having an affair prior to their divorce and with whom he shared an apartment under her nose, and he did the same thing to Lorraine, to marry his third wife.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0212304}}\n\n[[Category:1999 television films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:1990s thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:CBS network films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Lethal Vows\n| image                = \n| image_size           = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = \n| genre                = [[Drama]], [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]\n| creator              = \n| based_on             = \n| writer               = \n| screenplay           = \n| story                = \n| director             = [[Paul Schneider (director)|Paul Schneider]]\n| starring             = [[John Ritter]]<br />[[Marg Helgenberger]]<br />[[Megan Gallagher]]\n| narrated             = \n| theme_music_composer = \n| country              = United States\n| language             = English\n| num_episodes         = \n| producer             = Robert F.
