It is part of the [[Volcanic Seven Summits]] mountaineering challenge.\n\n==Symbolism and mythology==\nDamavand is a significant mountain in [[Persian mythology]]. It is the symbol of Iranian resistance against despotism and foreign rule in Persian poetry and literature. In [[Zoroastrian]] texts and mythology, the three-headed dragon [[Zahhak|A\u017ei Dah\u0101ka]] was chained within Mount Dam\u0101vand, there to remain until the end of the world. In a later version of the same legend, the tyrant [[Zahhak|Zahh\u0101k]] was also chained in a cave somewhere in Mount Dam\u0101vand after being defeated by [[Kaveh the blacksmith|K\u0101veh]] and [[Fereydun|Fereyd\u016bn]]. Persian poet [[Ferdowsi]] depicts this event in his masterpiece, the ''[[Shahnameh]]'':\n\n{{lang|fa|\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0636\u062d\u0627\u06a9 \u0631\u0627 \u0686\u0648\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0646\u062f}}<br />\n{{lang|fa|\u0628\u0647 \u06a9\u0648\u0647 \u062f\u0645\u0627\u0648\u0646\u062f \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0634 \u0628\u0628\u0646\u062f}}\n\n''biy\u00e2varad Zahh\u00e2k r\u00e2 \u010don navand<br/>\n''be kuh-e Dam\u00e2vand krd\u0161 beband''\n\nHe brought Zahhak like a horse to mount Damavand,<br/>\nAnd tied him at the peak tight and bound\n\nThe mountain is said to hold magical powers in the ''Shahnameh''.

The first verse of this poem reads:\n\n{{lang|fa|\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u0648 \u0633\u067e\u06cc\u062f \u067e\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0628\u0646\u062f}}<br />\n{{lang|fa|\u0627\u06cc \u06af\u0646\u0628\u062f \u06af\u06cc\u062a\u06cc\u060c \u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0645\u0627\u0648\u0646\u062f}}\n\n''Ey div-e sepid-e p\u00e2yi dar band,<br />\n''Ey gonbad-e giti, ey Dam\u0101vand''\n\nO white giant with feet in chains<br />\nO dome of the world, O Dam\u0101vand\n\nMount Damavand is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Iranian 10,000 [[Iranian rial|rials]] banknote.<ref>[http://www.cbi.ir/default_en.aspx Central Bank of Iran].

While no historic eruptions have been recorded, [[hot springs]] at the base and on the flanks, and [[fumaroles]] and [[solfatara]] near the summit, indicate a hot or cooling magma body still present beneath the volcano.\n\nThe most important of these hot springs are located in ''Abe Garm Larijan'' in a village by the name Larijan in the district of Larijan in Lar Valley. The water from this spring is useful in the treatment of chronic wounds and skin diseases.

It is near the southern coast of the [[Caspian Sea]], in [[Amol County]], [[Mazandaran Province]], 66 kilometres (41 miles) northeast of the city of [[Tehran]].<ref>Microsoft Encarta World Atlas, 2001, Microsoft Corporation</ref>\n\nMount Dam\u0101vand is the [[List of peaks by prominence|12th most prominent peak]] in the world, and the second most prominent in Asia after [[Mount Everest]]. It is part of the [[Volcanic Seven Summits]] mountaineering challenge.\n\n==Symbolism and mythology==\nDamavand is a significant mountain in [[Persian mythology]]. It is the symbol of Iranian resistance against despotism and foreign rule in Persian poetry and literature. In [[Zoroastrian]] texts and mythology, the three-headed dragon [[Zahhak|A\u017ei Dah\u0101ka]] was chained within Mount Dam\u0101vand, there to remain until the end of the world. In a later version of the same legend, the tyrant [[Zahhak|Zahh\u0101k]] was also chained in a cave somewhere in Mount Dam\u0101vand after being defeated by [[Kaveh the blacksmith|K\u0101veh]] and [[Fereydun|Fereyd\u016bn]]. Persian poet [[Ferdowsi]] depicts this event in his masterpiece, the ''[[Shahnameh]]'':\n\n{{lang|fa|\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0636\u062d\u0627\u06a9 \u0631\u0627 \u0686\u0648\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0646\u062f}}<br />\n{{lang|fa|\u0628\u0647 \u06a9\u0648\u0647 \u062f\u0645\u0627\u0648\u0646\u062f \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0634 \u0628\u0628\u0646\u062f}}\n\n''biy\u00e2varad Zahh\u00e2k r\u00e2 \u010don navand<br/>\n''be kuh-e Dam\u00e2vand krd\u0161 beband''\n\nHe brought Zahhak like a horse to mount Damavand,<br/>\nAnd tied him at the peak tight and bound\n\nThe mountain is said to hold magical powers in the ''Shahnameh''. Dam\u0101vand has also been named in the Iranian legend of [[Arash (mythology)|Arash]] (as recounted by [[Bal'ami]]) as the location from which the hero shot his magical arrow to mark the border of [[Iran]], during the border dispute between Iran and [[Turan]].\nThe poem Dam\u0101vand by [[Mohammad Taghi Bahar|Mohammad Taq\u012b Bah\u0101r]] is also one fine example of the mountain's significance in [[Persian literature]]. The first verse of this poem reads:\n\n{{lang|fa|\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u0648 \u0633\u067e\u06cc\u062f \u067e\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0628\u0646\u062f}}<br />\n{{lang|fa|\u0627\u06cc \u06af\u0646\u0628\u062f \u06af\u06cc\u062a\u06cc\u060c \u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0645\u0627\u0648\u0646\u062f}}\n\n''Ey div-e sepid-e p\u00e2yi dar band,<br />\n''Ey gonbad-e giti, ey Dam\u0101vand''\n\nO white giant with feet in chains<br />\nO dome of the world, O Dam\u0101vand\n\nMount Damavand is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Iranian 10,000 [[Iranian rial|rials]] banknote.<ref>[http://www.cbi.ir/default_en.aspx Central Bank of Iran].

After several known eruptions around 600,000 and 280,000 years ago, its last eruption was around 5300 BC in the [[Holocene]]. Its steep cone is formed of ash and [[lava]] flows mainly of [[trachyte]], [[andesite]] and [[basalt]]. The [[Quaternary]] lavas are directly on the [[Jurassic]] sediments.<ref>Geological Map of Iran, National Geoscience Database of Iran, www.ngdir.ir</ref> The volcano is crowned by a small crater with sulfuric deposits.

While no historic eruptions have been recorded, [[hot springs]] at the base and on the flanks, and [[fumaroles]] and [[solfatara]] near the summit, indicate a hot or cooling magma body still present beneath the volcano.\n\nThe most important of these hot springs are located in ''Abe Garm Larijan'' in a village by the name Larijan in the district of Larijan in Lar Valley. The water from this spring is useful in the treatment of chronic wounds and skin diseases. Near these springs there are public baths with small pools for public use.\n\n== Routes to the summit ==\n[[File:Damavand Volcanic Crater.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Damavand volcanic crater in August 2009]]\n\nA major settlement for [[mountain climber]]s is the new Iranian Mountain Federation Camp in the village of [[Polour]], located on the south of the mountain.\n\nThere are at least 16 known routes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sogol.com/WHP/IINFO/Ready%20%20INT/DAMAVAND%20MAP2.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311121019/http://www.sogol.com/WHP/IINFO/Ready%20%20INT/DAMAVAND%20MAP2.jpg |archivedate=2007-03-11 }}</ref> to the summit, with varying levels of difficulty.

Greek juniper (''[[Juniperus excelsa]]'') is common in the higher altitudes. On northern slopes, because of higher humidity, there are wild oak, beech and hazel trees like: Persian Oak (''[[Quercus macranthera]]''), Eastern Hornbean (''[[Carpinus orientalis]]''), and Oriental beech (''[[Fagus orientalis]]'').<ref>Mozaffarian, V.
