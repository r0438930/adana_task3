He began his literary activity early on, and began to publish by his 30s after he traveled during several seasons by ship through [[Patagonia]], he settled there for almost 15 years, where he developed his first storybook:  \"Seventy Times Seven,\" which won the prestigious award of Editorial Emec\u00e9, and became a [[bestseller]], based in a vision that is violent, erotic, and with solid precepts and moral questions about religion. That is what would become the hallmark of S\u00e1enz for several years. The critics agree in indicating that a religious axis always passes through the stories of this author; either through one of his characters or as in \"Christ Pie\", where religiosity is in controversy with the established religion, as opposed to the individual dialogue that the character has with God).\nLater on, he participated in the screenplay adaptation for the big screen of the two stories in \"Seventy Times Seven\", that were joined to assemble the frame for the homonymous film directed by [[Leopoldo Torre Nilson]] (1962).\n\nAfter this onset, S\u00e1enz won the Award of [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] in Spanish, in 1963, with his storybook \"No\".\n\nThe same year, he won the award Argentores by the Sociedad Argentina de Autores with \"Thirty Thirty\", a tale raised in the manner of an American western, but located in Patagonia.\n\nIn 1964 he published in the Editorial Emec\u00e9 \"The Necessary Sin\", a novel that was later adapted to create the script for the film version, called  \"Nobody heard Cecilio Fuentes scream \" directed by Fernando Siro, and winner of the Silver Shell (Concha de Plata) in the International Film Festival of San Sebastian, Spain (1965).\nThen he began to write plays and very soon he was awarded the prize \u201cCasa de las Am\u00e9ricas\u201d, in Cuba in 1966, with \"Hip Hip Ufa\", published by Editorial Emec\u00e9, and was adapted to create the script for the film version with the title \"Ufa with sex\" under the direction of Rodolfo Kuhn -1972. Then he worked again in its adaptation with Pablo Silva, for the well-known play \"Sex, Lies and Money\" (Bs As. 2002/3).\n\nAccording to his statements, S\u00e1enz took literary vacations between books by writing small books of humor, which were very successful. Among them stands out \"I Also Was A [[Spermatozoid]]\" published by the editorial Torres Ag\u00fcero. \nThen began an intimate and detailed description of the feminine universe, with a vision that is surprising and original, and promptly became a bestseller titled \"Open Letter To My Future Ex-wife\" published by editorial Emec\u00e9 in 1968, and re-edited several times, until the last version in 1999. Saenz is an author who can capture the essence of the feminine sensibility, characters that he treats with a great deal of tenderness.\n\nHis next play \"Who me?\" was published in 1969 and re-edited by Gargoyle editions in 2004, was played almost without interruption since its publication, and it became a classic of the absurd in the Argentine theater scene. He also worked as a screenwriter for various characters, including one for comic actor [[Luis Sandrini]] in the film \"Kuma-ching\", under the direction of Daniel Tinayre.\n\nWhen the military dictatorship happened in Argentina between 1976 and 1983- S\u00e1enz received death threats and had to leave the country to exile, and after touring for a while, he settled in Punta del Este, Uruguay. During that period he didn\u2019t write at all.\n\nHe returns in 1983 with the historical novel \"El Argentinazo\", winning the \u201cFaja de Honor\u201d of the SADE (Sociedad Argentina de Escritores) that later would become a play, in which he worked together with Francisco Javier, director of the piece, in its adaptation, staged by his group Los Volatineros (The Acrobats) at the Cervantes National Theatre in 1985.\n\nThen he returns to police stories, already hinted in his early tales, with \"On His Open Eyelids Walked A Fly\" a novel of 1986, that also turned into a theatrical version, written by Saenz and entitled \u201cThe Boludas\", also turned into a film. And \"the Satyr of The Roaring Laugh\" based on real events.\n\nLater on, he began to investigate the Dead Sea Scrolls and the figure of [[Jesus Christ]] in association with Dr. Alberto Cormillot. They traveled together through Israel, Egypt, and New York, interviewing personalities related to the subject, and all of this led to the publication of \"Christ standing\" (Editorial Planeta 1995 and 1998).\n\nLater he continues its unique, human, erotic, and poetic vision of the Argentine [[caudillo]]s in his historical novels \"The Wrong Patria\" (Editorial Planeta, 1991), \" White Mal\u00f3n \" (Editorial Emec\u00e9 1995) and \"My Forgetfulness / O what General Paz Didn\u2019t Said In His Memoirs \"(1998, Editorial Sudamericana).\n\nIn 2004 he published \"As A Writer\" with some formulas on how he wrote his best stories, and the novel \"Pastor Of Bats\" (G\u00e1rgola Ediciones, 2005)\n\nMany of his works have been translated and published in different languages, and his stories show up in numerous compilations, as in \"Latin Blood\" by Donald Yates (The best crime and detective stories of South America / Editorial Herder and Herder New York 1972); or \"The Best Patagonian Narrations\" by Mary Belts & Cristian Aliaga, Editorial Ameghino Buenos Aires 1988, among others.\nHe currently lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he works as a writer, coordinates its literary workshop and also makes cultural commentaries on the radio, in addition to writing articles as free-lance for the most prestigious newspapers and magazines. A prolific writer and author of numerous bestselling, the plays of Dalmiro S\u00e1enz are among the most represented in Argentina. His style is characterized by a relentless sarcasm accompanied by a hilarity that reaches absurdity.\n\nHe died on 11 September 2016 at the age of 90.<ref>[http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/221446/writer-of-acerbic-works-dalmiro-s\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a1enz-dies Writer of acerbic works Dalmiro S\u00e1enz dies]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://www.autores.org.ar/dsaenz Sitio Oficial de Dalmiro S\u00e1enz]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20141210041752/http://asesinosdenovela.com.ar/dalmiro.htm Entrevista a Dalmiro S\u00e1enz]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saenz, Dalmiro}}\n[[Category:Argentine male writers]]\n[[Category:1926 births]]\n[[Category:2016 deaths]]\n[[Category:Burials at La Chacarita Cemetery]]\n", "text_old": "'''Dalmiro Antonio S\u00e1enz''' (June 13, 1926 \u2013 September 11, 2016) was an Argentinian  writer and playwright.\n\n==Biography==\nDalmiro Antonio Saenz was born in Buenos Aires, in 1926.
