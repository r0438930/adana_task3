For example, it is now generally admitted that St. George cannot safely be identified by the nameless martyr spoken of by Eusebius (Church History VIII.5), who tore down Diocletian's edict of persecution at Nicomedia. The version of the legend in which Diocletian appears as persecutor is not primitive. Diocletian is only a rationalized form of the name Dadianus. Moreover, the connection of the saint's name with Nicomedia is inconsistent with the early cultus at Diospolis.

His [[calendar of saints|major feast day]] is on 23 April (Julian calendar 23 April currently corresponds to Gregorian calendar 6 May). If, however, the feast occurs before [[Easter]], it is celebrated on [[Easter Monday]], instead. The Russian Orthodox Church also celebrates two additional feasts in honour of St. George. One is on 3 November, commemorating the [[consecration]] of a [[cathedral]] dedicated to him in Lydda during the reign of [[Constantine the Great]] (305\u201337).

The flag of Saint George (white with red cross) was also carried by the Portuguese troops and hoisted in the fortresses, during the 15th century. \"Portugal and Saint George\" became the battle cry of the Portuguese troops, being still today the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Army]], with simply \"Saint George\" being the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Navy]].<ref>{{citation | title = Daily Life in Portugal in the Late Middle Ages | first1 = AH | last1 = de Oliveira Marques | first2 = V\u00edtor | last2 = Andr\u00e9 | first3 = SS | last3 = Wyatt | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1971 | isbn = 0-299-05584-1 | page = 216}}.</ref>\n\nSaint George, is also the patron saint of the region of [[Aragon]], in [[Spain]], where his feast day is celebrated on 23 April and is known as \"Aragon Day\", ''or 'D\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n''' in Spanish.  He became the patron saint of the former [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and [[Crown of Aragon]] when King [[Pedro I of Aragon]] won the [[Battle of Alcoraz]] in 1096.  Legend has it that victory eventually fell to the Christian armies when St. George appeared to them on the battlefield, helping them secure the reconquest of the city of [[Huesca]] which had been under the Muslim control of the [[Taifa]] of [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]]. The battle, which had begun two years earlier in 1094, was long and arduous, and had also taken the life of King Pedro's own father, King [[Sancho Ramirez]].  With the Aragonese spirits flagging, it is said that Saint George  descending from heaven on his charger and bearing a dark red cross, appeared at the head of the Christian cavalry leading the knights into battle.  Interpreting this as a sign of protection from God, the Christian militia returned emboldened to the battle field, more energized than ever, convinced theirs was the banner of the one true faith. Defeated, the [[moors]] rapidly abandoned the battlefield. After two years of being locked down under siege, Huesca was liberated and King Pedro made his triumphal entry into the city. To celebrate this victory, the cross of Saint George was adopted as the coat of arms of Huesca and Aragon, in honour of their saviour.  After the taking of Huesca, King Pedro aided the military leader and nobleman, Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar, otherwise known as [[El Cid]], with a coalition army from Aragon in the long reconquest of the [[Kingdom of Valencia]].\n\nTales of King Pedro's success at Huesca and in leading his expedition of armies with El Cid against the Moors, under the auspices of Saint George on his standard, spread quickly throughout the realm and beyond the Crown of Aragon, and Christian armies throughout Europe quickly began adopting Saint George as their protector and patron, during all subsequent Crusades to the Holy Lands.  By 1117, the military order of Templars adopted the Cross of Saint George as a simple unifying sign for international Christian militia embroidered on the left hand side of their tunics, placed above the heart.\n\nThe Cross of Saint George, also known in Aragon as The Cross of Alcoraz, continues to emblazon the flags of all of Aragon's provinces.\n\nThe association of Saint George with chivalry and noblemen in Aragon continued through the ages.  Indeed, even the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], in his book on the Adventures of [[Don Quixote]], also mentions the [[Jousting]] events that took place at the festival of Saint George in [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]] in Aragon where one could gain international renown in winning a joust against any of the knights of Aragon.\n\nIn Valencia, Catalonia, the Balearics, Malta, Sicily and Sardinia, the origins of the veneration of Saint George go back to their shared history as territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]], thereby sharing the same legend.\n\nOne of the highest civil distinctions awarded in Catalonia is the [[Creu de Sant Jordi Award|Saint George's Cross]] (''Creu de Sant Jordi''). The [[Sant Jordi Awards]] have been awarded in Barcelona since 1957.\n\nSaint George (''Sant Jordi'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is also the patron saint of [[Catalonia]]. His cross appears in many buildings and local flags, including the [[flag of Barcelona]], the Catalan capital.  A Catalan variation to the traditional legend places Saint George's life story as having occurred in the town of [[Montblanc, Tarragona|Montblanc]], near [[Tarragona]].\n\n==Arms and flag==\n{{Main|Saint George's Cross}}\n[[File:Flag of England.svg|thumb|upright|Saint George's cross]]\n\nIt became fashionable in the 15th century, with the full development of classical heraldry, to provide [[attributed arms]] to saints and other historical characters from the pre-heraldic ages. The widespread attribution to Saint George of the red cross on a white field in western art \u2013 \"[[Saint George's Cross]]\" \u2013 probably first arose in [[Genoa]], which had adopted this image for [[Genoa#Flag|their flag]] and George as their patron saint in the 12th century. A ''vexillum beati Georgii'' is mentioned  in the Genovese annals for the year 1198, referring to a red flag with a depiction of Saint George and the dragon.  An illumination of this flag is shown in the annals for the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this \"George's flag\", from at least 1218, and was known as the '' insignia cruxata comunis Janue'' (\"cross ensign of the commune of Genoa\"). The flag showing the saint himself was the city's principal war flag, but the flag showing the plain cross was used alongside it in the 1240s.<ref>Aldo Ziggioto, \"Genova\", in ''Vexilla Italica'' 1, XX (1993); Aldo Ziggioto, \"Le Bandiere degli Stati Italiani\", in ''Armi Antiche'' 1994, cited after [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/it-genoa.html Pier Paolo Lugli, 18 July 2000] on ''[[Flags of the World]]''.</ref>\n\nIn 1348 [[Edward III of England]] chose Saint George as the patron saint of his [[Order of the Garter]], and also took to using a red-on-white cross in the hoist of his [[Royal Standards of England|Royal Standard]].\n\nThe term \"Saint George's cross\" was at first associated with any plain [[Christian cross variants#Greek cross|Greek cross]] touching the edges of the field (not necessarily red on white).<ref>William Woo Seymour, ''The Cross in Tradition, History and Art'', 1898, [https://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/362/mode/2up/search/George p. 363]</ref> [[Thomas Fuller]] in 1647 spoke of \"the plain or St George's cross\" as \"the mother of all the others\" (that is, the other [[Crosses in heraldry|heraldic crosses]]).<ref>Fuller, ''A Supplement tu the Historie of the Holy Warre'' (Book V), 1647, chapter 4.</ref>\n\n==Iconography and models==\n[[File:Icon8.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Byzantine]] icon of Saint George, [[Athens]], Greece.]]\n\nSaint George is most commonly depicted in early icons, [[mosaic]]s, and [[fresco]]s wearing armour contemporary with the depiction, executed in gilding and silver colour, intended to identify him as a [[Roman army|Roman soldier]]. Particularly after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and Saint George's association with the [[crusades]], he is often portrayed mounted upon a [[White horse (mythology)|white horse]]. Thus, a 2003 Vatican stamp (issued on the anniversary of the Saint's death) depicts an armoured Saint George atop a white horse, killing the dragon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |title=Vatican stamps |publisher=Vaticanstate.va |date= |access-date=23 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001194032/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |archive-date=1 October 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEastern Orthodox iconography also permits Saint George to ride a black horse, as in a Russian icon in the British museum collection.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/online_research_catalogues/russian_icons/catalogue_of_russian_icons/the_british_museum_collection/british_museum_collection_2.aspx Bobrov, Yury. \"A catalogue of the Russian icons in the British Museum\", The British Museum]</ref>\nIn the south Lebanese village of [[Mieh Mieh]], the Saint George Church for Melkite Catholics commissioned for its 75th jubilee in 2012 (under the guidance of Mgr Sassine Gregoire), the only icons in the world portraying the whole life of Saint George, as well as the scenes of his torture and martyrdom (drawn in eastern iconographic style).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://noursat.tv/ar/news-details.php?id=2996|title=\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0645\u0627\u0631 \u062c\u0627\u0648\u0631\u062c\u064a\u0648\u0633 \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u064a\u0629|website=Noursat|access-date=11 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nSaint George may also be portrayed with [[Saint Demetrius]], another early [[soldier saint]]. When the two saintly warriors are together and mounted upon horses, they may resemble earthly manifestations of the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]]. Eastern traditions distinguish the two as Saint George rides a white horse and St. Demetrius a red horse (the red [[pigment]] may appear black if it has bituminized).\nSaint George can also be identified by his spearing a dragon, whereas Saint Demetrius may be spearing a human figure, representing [[Maximian]].\n\nDuring the early second millennium, Saint George became a model of [[chivalry]] in works of literature, including [[medieval romance]]s. In the 13th century, [[Jacobus de Voragine]], Archbishop of Genoa, compiled the ''Legenda Sanctorum'', (''Readings of the Saints'') also known as ''Legenda Aurea'' (the ''Golden Legend''). Its 177 chapters (182 in some editions) include the story of Saint George, among many others. After the invention of the printing press, the book became a bestseller.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{For|equestrian depictions|Saint George and the Dragon#Iconography}}\n{{Commons|Saint George structured art gallery}}\n\n===Eastern===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"250\" heights=\"250\">\nFile:Tetarteron sb1975.jpg|[[Tetarteron]] of [[Manuel I Komnenos]] (12th century) showing a bust of Saint George\nFile:Novgorod George.jpg|[[Saint George (icon, 1130)|Novgorod icon]] (1130)\nFile:Georgeladoga.jpg|A 12th-century depiction of St&nbsp;George in a church at the Russian village of [[Staraya Ladoga]]\nFile:LifeofStGeorge.JPG|Scenes from the life of Saint George, [[Kremikovtsi Monastery]], Bulgaria (15th century)\nFile:Moldavian battle flag.jpg|A 15th-century battle flag of [[Stephen the Great]] of [[Moldavia]] representing Saint George\nFile:St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter.JPG|A plaque, on which is represented St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter (15th century)\nFile:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De slag bij Adua TMnr 5956-2.jpg|\"[[Ethiopian Empire]] forces, assisted by St George (top), win the [[Battle of Adwa]] against [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].

In the [[Tridentine Calendar]] of 1568, it was given the [[ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite|rank]] of \"Semidouble\". In [[Pope Pius XII]]'s [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII|1955 calendar]] this rank was reduced to \"Simple\", and in [[Pope John XXIII]]'s [[General Roman Calendar of 1960|1960 calendar]] to a [[Commemoration (liturgy)|\"Commemoration\"]]. Since [[Pope Paul VI]]'s [[Mysterii Paschalis|1969 revision]], it appears as an optional \"[[Memorial (liturgy)|Memorial]]\". In some countries, such as [[England]], the rank is higher.

His [[calendar of saints|major feast day]] is on 23 April (Julian calendar 23 April currently corresponds to Gregorian calendar 6 May). If, however, the feast occurs before [[Easter]], it is celebrated on [[Easter Monday]], instead. The Russian Orthodox Church also celebrates two additional feasts in honour of St. George. One is on 3 November, commemorating the [[consecration]] of a [[cathedral]] dedicated to him in Lydda during the reign of [[Constantine the Great]] (305\u201337). When the church was consecrated, the [[relic]]s of the Saint George were transferred there.

Saint George's day is also a [[public holiday]].\n\nIn [[Serbia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] refers to Saint George as ''Sveti Djordje'' (''\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0402\u043e\u0440\u0452\u0435'') or ''Sveti Georgije'' (''\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0458\u0435'').

[[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]] attributed the victory of the Portuguese in the [[battle of Aljubarrota]] in 1385 to Saint George. During the reign of [[John I of Portugal]] (1357\u20131433), Saint George became the patron saint of Portugal and the King ordered that the saint's image on the horse be carried in the ''[[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]'' procession. The flag of Saint George (white with red cross) was also carried by the Portuguese troops and hoisted in the fortresses, during the 15th century. \"Portugal and Saint George\" became the battle cry of the Portuguese troops, being still today the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Army]], with simply \"Saint George\" being the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Navy]].<ref>{{citation | title = Daily Life in Portugal in the Late Middle Ages | first1 = AH | last1 = de Oliveira Marques | first2 = V\u00edtor | last2 = Andr\u00e9 | first3 = SS | last3 = Wyatt | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1971 | isbn = 0-299-05584-1 | page = 216}}.</ref>\n\nSaint George, is also the patron saint of the region of [[Aragon]], in [[Spain]], where his feast day is celebrated on 23 April and is known as \"Aragon Day\", ''or 'D\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n''' in Spanish.  He became the patron saint of the former [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and [[Crown of Aragon]] when King [[Pedro I of Aragon]] won the [[Battle of Alcoraz]] in 1096.  Legend has it that victory eventually fell to the Christian armies when St. George appeared to them on the battlefield, helping them secure the reconquest of the city of [[Huesca]] which had been under the Muslim control of the [[Taifa]] of [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]]. The battle, which had begun two years earlier in 1094, was long and arduous, and had also taken the life of King Pedro's own father, King [[Sancho Ramirez]].  With the Aragonese spirits flagging, it is said that Saint George  descending from heaven on his charger and bearing a dark red cross, appeared at the head of the Christian cavalry leading the knights into battle.  Interpreting this as a sign of protection from God, the Christian militia returned emboldened to the battle field, more energized than ever, convinced theirs was the banner of the one true faith. Defeated, the [[moors]] rapidly abandoned the battlefield. After two years of being locked down under siege, Huesca was liberated and King Pedro made his triumphal entry into the city. To celebrate this victory, the cross of Saint George was adopted as the coat of arms of Huesca and Aragon, in honour of their saviour.  After the taking of Huesca, King Pedro aided the military leader and nobleman, Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar, otherwise known as [[El Cid]], with a coalition army from Aragon in the long reconquest of the [[Kingdom of Valencia]].\n\nTales of King Pedro's success at Huesca and in leading his expedition of armies with El Cid against the Moors, under the auspices of Saint George on his standard, spread quickly throughout the realm and beyond the Crown of Aragon, and Christian armies throughout Europe quickly began adopting Saint George as their protector and patron, during all subsequent Crusades to the Holy Lands.  By 1117, the military order of Templars adopted the Cross of Saint George as a simple unifying sign for international Christian militia embroidered on the left hand side of their tunics, placed above the heart.\n\nThe Cross of Saint George, also known in Aragon as The Cross of Alcoraz, continues to emblazon the flags of all of Aragon's provinces.\n\nThe association of Saint George with chivalry and noblemen in Aragon continued through the ages.  Indeed, even the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], in his book on the Adventures of [[Don Quixote]], also mentions the [[Jousting]] events that took place at the festival of Saint George in [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]] in Aragon where one could gain international renown in winning a joust against any of the knights of Aragon.\n\nIn Valencia, Catalonia, the Balearics, Malta, Sicily and Sardinia, the origins of the veneration of Saint George go back to their shared history as territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]], thereby sharing the same legend.\n\nOne of the highest civil distinctions awarded in Catalonia is the [[Creu de Sant Jordi Award|Saint George's Cross]] (''Creu de Sant Jordi''). The [[Sant Jordi Awards]] have been awarded in Barcelona since 1957.\n\nSaint George (''Sant Jordi'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is also the patron saint of [[Catalonia]]. His cross appears in many buildings and local flags, including the [[flag of Barcelona]], the Catalan capital.  A Catalan variation to the traditional legend places Saint George's life story as having occurred in the town of [[Montblanc, Tarragona|Montblanc]], near [[Tarragona]].\n\n==Arms and flag==\n{{Main|Saint George's Cross}}\n[[File:Flag of England.svg|thumb|upright|Saint George's cross]]\n\nIt became fashionable in the 15th century, with the full development of classical heraldry, to provide [[attributed arms]] to saints and other historical characters from the pre-heraldic ages. The widespread attribution to Saint George of the red cross on a white field in western art - \"[[Saint George's Cross]]\" - probably first arose in [[Genoa]], which had adopted this image for [[Genoa#Flag|their flag]] and George as their patron saint in the 12th century. A ''vexillum beati Georgii'' is mentioned  in the Genovese annals for the year 1198, referring to a red flag with a depiction of Saint George and the dragon.  An illumination of this flag is shown in the annals for the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this \"George's flag\", from at least 1218, and was known as the '' insignia cruxata comunis Janue'' (\"cross ensign of the commune of Genoa\"). The flag showing the saint himself was the city's principal war flag, but the flag showing the plain cross was used alongside it in the 1240s.<ref>Aldo Ziggioto, \"Genova\", in ''Vexilla Italica'' 1, XX (1993); Aldo Ziggioto, \"Le Bandiere degli Stati Italiani\", in ''Armi Antiche'' 1994, cited after [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/it-genoa.html Pier Paolo Lugli, 18 July 2000] on ''[[Flags of the World]]''.</ref>\n\nIn 1348 [[Edward III of England]] chose Saint George as the patron saint of his [[Order of the Garter]], and also took to using a red-on-white cross in the hoist of his [[Royal Standards of England|Royal Standard]].\n\nThe term \"Saint George's cross\" was at first associated with any plain [[Christian cross variants#Greek cross|Greek cross]] touching the edges of the field (not necessarily red on white).<ref>William Woo Seymour, ''The Cross in Tradition, History and Art'', 1898, [https://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/362/mode/2up/search/George p. 363]</ref> [[Thomas Fuller]] in 1647 spoke of \"the plain or St George's cross\" as \"the mother of all the others\" (that is, the other [[Crosses in heraldry|heraldic crosses]]).<ref>Fuller, ''A Supplement tu the Historie of the Holy Warre'' (Book V), 1647, chapter 4.</ref>\n\n==Iconography and models==\n[[File:Icon8.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Byzantine]] icon of Saint George, [[Athens]], Greece.]]\n\nSaint George is most commonly depicted in early icons, [[mosaic]]s, and [[fresco]]s wearing armour contemporary with the depiction, executed in gilding and silver colour, intended to identify him as a [[Roman army|Roman soldier]].

Thus, a 2003 Vatican stamp (issued on the anniversary of the Saint's death) depicts an armoured Saint George atop a white horse, killing the dragon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |title=Vatican stamps |publisher=Vaticanstate.va |date= |access-date=23 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001194032/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |archive-date=1 October 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEastern Orthodox iconography also permits Saint George to ride a black horse, as in a Russian icon in the British museum collection.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/online_research_catalogues/russian_icons/catalogue_of_russian_icons/the_british_museum_collection/british_museum_collection_2.aspx Bobrov, Yury. \"A catalogue of the Russian icons in the British Museum\", The British Museum]</ref>\nIn the south Lebanese village of [[Mieh Mieh]], the Saint George Church for Melkite Catholics commissioned for its 75th jubilee in 2012 (under the guidance of Mgr Sassine Gregoire), the only icons in the world portraying the whole life of Saint George, as well as the scenes of his torture and martyrdom (drawn in eastern iconographic style).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://noursat.tv/ar/news-details.php?id=2996|title=\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0645\u0627\u0631 \u062c\u0627\u0648\u0631\u062c\u064a\u0648\u0633 \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u064a\u0629|website=Noursat|access-date=11 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nSaint George may also be portrayed with [[Saint Demetrius]], another early [[soldier saint]]. When the two saintly warriors are together and mounted upon horses, they may resemble earthly manifestations of the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]]. Eastern traditions distinguish the two as Saint George rides a white horse and St. Demetrius a red horse (the red [[pigment]] may appear black if it has bituminized). \nSaint George can also be identified by his spearing a dragon, whereas Saint Demetrius may be spearing a human figure, representing [[Maximian]].\n\nDuring the early second millennium, Saint George became a model of [[chivalry]] in works of literature, including [[medieval romance]]s. In the 13th century, [[Jacobus de Voragine]], Archbishop of Genoa, compiled the ''Legenda Sanctorum'', (''Readings of the Saints'') also known as ''Legenda Aurea'' (the ''Golden Legend''). Its 177 chapters (182 in some editions) include the story of Saint George, among many others. After the invention of the printing press, the book became a bestseller.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{For|equestrian depictions|Saint George and the Dragon#Iconography}}\n{{commons|Saint George structured art gallery}}\n\n===Eastern===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"250\" heights=\"250\">\nFile:Tetarteron sb1975.jpg|[[Tetarteron]] of [[Manuel I Komnenos]] (12th century) showing a bust of Saint George\nFile:Novgorod George.jpg|[[Saint George (icon, 1130)|Novgorod icon]] (1130)\nFile:Georgeladoga.jpg|A 12th-century depiction of St&nbsp;George in a church at the Russian village of [[Staraya Ladoga]]\nFile:LifeofStGeorge.JPG|Scenes from the life of Saint George, [[Kremikovtsi Monastery]], Bulgaria (15th century)\nFile:Moldavian battle flag.jpg|A 15th-century battle flag of [[Stephen the Great]] of [[Moldavia]] representing Saint George\nFile:St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter.JPG|A plaque, on which is represented St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter (15th century)\nFile:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De slag bij Adua TMnr 5956-2.jpg|\"[[Ethiopian Empire]] forces, assisted by St George (top), win the [[Battle of Adwa]] against [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].
