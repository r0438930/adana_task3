However, \u2018Iraqi was also a Gnostic who often spoke in the language of love.  For him, as well as many other Sufis, love was realized knowledge.  \u2018Iraqi's writing ''Lama\u2019at'' (''Divine Flashes'') fits into a genre of Sufi writings which expresses certain doctrines in the language of love.\n\nAs Shaykh Baha'uddin was dying, he named Fakhruddin 'Iraqi to be his successor.\n\nWhen it became known that 'Iraqi had been named head of the [[Suhrawardiyya|Suhrawardi Order]], some in the order became jealous and denounced him to the Sultan who sought to have 'Araghi arrested.\n\n'Iraqi fled the area with a few close companions, and they eventually made their way to [[Makkah]] and [[Medina]]. Later they moved north to [[Konya]] in Turkey. This was Konya at the time of [[Rumi]]. 'Araghi often listened to Rumi teach and recite poetry, and later attended Rumi's funeral.\n\nAlthough 'Araghi was nominally the head (in exile) of a large and respected Sufi order, he humbly became the disciple of another Sufi master [[Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi]], who also lived in Konya at the time. Qunawi was the son-in-law of the recently deceased Sufi philosopher [[Ibn 'Arabi]]. Although less known in the West today, Qunawi was perhaps the pre-eminent Sufi teacher in Konya at the time, even better known than his neighbor Rumi.\n\n'Iraqi was deeply devoted to Qunawi and to the teachings of [[Ibn 'Arabi]]. It was a series of speeches [[Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi|al-Qunawi]] delivered on the esoteric meaning of [[Ibn 'Arabi]]'s great works that inspired 'Iraqi to compose his own masterpiece of commentary and poetry named the [[Lama'at]] or Divine Flashes.\n\n== Works ==\n''Lama\u2019at'' or ''Divine Flashes'' is the best known of \u2018Iraqi's writings and was written during his time in what is now Turkey.  A part of the \u2018language of love\u2019 genre within Sufi writing, it takes an interesting view on how one view the world.
