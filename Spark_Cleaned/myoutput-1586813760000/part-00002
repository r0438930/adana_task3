The leaves are egg shaped to narrow elliptical, mostly {{cvt|5-15|mm}} long and {{cvt|2-3|mm}} wide. The flowers are white or pink, {{cvt|7-10|mm}} wide and are usually borne singly on short side shoots. The [[Hypanthium|floral cup]] is {{cvt|2-3|mm}} long and is covered with flattened silky hairs on a [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] up to {{cvt|1|mm}} long. The [[sepal]]s are triangular, about {{cvt|2|mm}} long, the [[petal]]s about {{cvt|3|mm}} long and the [[stamen]]s less than {{cvt|1|mm}} long. Flowering mainly occurs from September to November and the fruit is a [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] {{cvt|3-4|mm}} long with the remains of the sepals attached, but that falls from the plant after the release of the seeds.<ref name=FloraBase>{{FloraBase|name=''Leptospermum inelegans''|id=12688}}</ref><ref name=\"Telopea\">{{cite journal |last1=Thompson |first1=Joy |title=A revision of the genus ''Leptospermum'' (Myrtaceae) |journal=Telopea |date=1989 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=376\u2013377}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\n''Leptospermum inelegans'' was first formally described in 1989 by [[Joy Thompson (botanist)]] in the journal ''[[Telopea (journal)|Telopea]]'' from specimens collected by [[Roger Hnatiuk]].<ref name=\"Telopea\" /><ref name=APNI>{{cite web|title=''Leptospermum inelegans''|url= https://id.biodiversity.org.au/instance/apni/524701|publisher=APNI|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> The [[Botanical name|specific epithet]] (''inelegans'') is a Latin word meaning \"not choice\" or \"tasteless\", referring to the usual habit of this species.<ref name=\"Telopea\" /><ref name=\"Sharr\">{{cite book |author=[[Francis Aubie Sharr]]|title=Western Australian Plant Names and their Meanings |date=2019 |publisher=Four Gables Press |location=Kardinya, Western Australia |isbn=9780958034180 |page=224}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThis tea-tree is usually found in scrub or heath on hills and undulating plains and occurs in parts of the [[Coolgardie (biogeographic region)|Coolgardie]], [[Esperance Plains]] and [[Mallee (biogeographic region)|Mallee]] [[IBRA|biogeographic regions]].<ref name=\"Telopea\" /><ref name=\"FloraBase\" />\n\n==Conservation status==\n''Leptospermum inelegans'' is classified as \"not threatened\" by the Western Australian Government [[Department of Parks and Wildlife (Western Australia)|Department of Parks and Wildlife]].<ref name=\"FloraBase\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q15369119}}\n\n[[Category:Leptospermum|inelegans]]\n[[Category:Flora of Western Australia]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1989]]\n", "text_old": "{{speciesbox\n|image = \n|status = \n|status_system = \n|genus = Leptospermum\n|species = inelegans\n|authority = [[Joy Thomps.]]<ref name=\"APC\">{{cite web |title=''Leptospermum inelegans'' |url=https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/apc-format/display/98620|website=Australian Plant Census |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> \n}}\n\n'''''Leptospermum inelegans''''' is a species of straggly shrub that is [[Endemism|endemic]] to Western Australia.
