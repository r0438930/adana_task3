It helps to understand what building restoration is in context with the other standards:\n* '''Preservation''' \"places a high premium on the retention of all historic fabric through conservation, maintenance and repair.\" All materials added to a building over its life are retained and only work which is necessary to protect it from deterioration is carried out.\n* '''Rehabilitation''' is a standard for preservation but is more lenient because it presumes the building is so deteriorated that it needs some repairs to prevent further deterioration.\n* '''Restoration''' includes preservation, leaving as much material untouched as possible, reconstruction to replace missing elements, and repair work to bring the building to a historically accurate condition in one particular time period. This may include removing some historic building elements (after documenting them) to make the building historically accurate for a specific date in history.\n* '''Reconstruction''' allows the re-creation of a missing building or element in all new, appropriate materials.\n\nThe first steps in a restoration to the Secretary's standards are to study the building and choose a time period for the restoration. The new use of the building should be consistent with the original use or at least with the time period of the restoration. Materials which were added after the chosen time period must be documented and then may be removed while preserving and repairing the appropriate materials. Materials missing may be reconstructed to \"...match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials.\" which are evidence based. Modern chemical and physical treatments may be gently used if they do not damage the historic materials, and archaeological resources will be preserved or mitigated. The standards recognize that there are inherent conflicts with modern codes and regulations for energy efficiency, health, safety, and accessibility. The standards allow sensitive alterations of historic buildings to meet the spirit of the codes and regulations, if necessary.\n\n==Agents of Deterioration==\nAs buildings can sustain various forms of damage and deterioration over time, understanding the cause of this damage and finding the best way to treat and prevent it is an important aspect to building restoration. The Agents of Deterioration are the ten primary sources of damage to heritage objects and buildings comprised in a comprehensive list by the Canadian Conservation Institute. The Agents are physical forces, fire, pests, light (ultraviolet and infrared), [[Relative humidity|incorrect relative humidity]], thieves and vandals, water, pollutants, incorrect temperature and the [[dissociation]] of objects.<ref>Canadian Conservation Institute.

To mitigate general water control, an inspection checklist can be created for staff to inspect noticeable pipes, make note of any leaks within the building during storms as well as ensuring exterior elements of the historic building are adequately removing water such as drains and gutters. Internal humidity control devices can also mitigate mold and damage stemming from moisture.\n\nPest control and awareness can prevent a variety of damage to historic buildings as well as preventing further damage in the future. Pests can include a variety of things from termites who can feast on the wooden structural elements of a historic building to rodents who may gnaw on or burrow into the building and objects within the building. Damage created by large pest infestations such as termites can be irreversible, with building restoration taking the form of replacement in order to maintain a sound structure for the building.<ref>Jones, R., Silence, P. & Webster, M.
