It will be the 59th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. Voters will select [[United States Electoral College|presidential electors]] who in turn will vote on December 14, 2020,<ref name=\"Nu5tF\" /> to either elect a new [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] or reelect the incumbents [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]] respectively. The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to June 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics. Former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] became the presumptive Democratic nominee when Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], his last major primary opponent, suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020. The winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n\nBiden is currently the oldest major party presumptive nominee in U.S. history;{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]], currently the oldest major party nominee to contest a presidential general election, was 73 when [[1984 United States presidential election|re-elected in 1984]] whereas Biden will be 77 and Trump will be 74 on Election Day in 2020.}} and if he is elected and inaugurated, he will also become the oldest serving president.{{efn|On Inauguration Day in 2021, Biden will be 78 years, 62 days old which is [[List of presidents of the United States by age|79 days older]] than [[Ronald Reagan]] was when he left office in 1989.

Bush]] and [[Al Gore]] were incumbent vice presidents at the time of the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] and [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] elections, respectively).\n\n==Background==\n===Procedure===\n{{further|United States presidential election#Procedure}}\n\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old and a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.<ref name=\"JAb2o\" /><ref name=\"t9U5e\" /> On March 12, President Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.<ref name=\"NM4Ve\" /> The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the [[CNN]] studios in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"iUhTN\" /> Several states have also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,<ref name=\"2rHUH\" /> Kentucky,<ref name=\"BOyPg\" /> Louisiana,<ref name=\"9Jz7W\" /> Ohio,<ref name=\"YrwnH\" /> and Maryland.<ref name=\"slHNd\" /> As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates have halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over coronavirus concerns. Political analysts have stated that the moratorium on traditional campaigning coupled to the effects of the pandemic on the nation could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.<ref name=\"sXzhh\" /><ref name=\"u1jgH\" /><ref name=\"w7xk5\" />\n\nThe [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] included money for states to increase mail-in voting.<ref name=\"NQGai\" />\n\nGovernment response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled to the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act|economic stimulus]] remains a major campaign issue for both parties.<ref name=\"kLGv5\" /><ref name=\"jAPgE\" />\n\n==Nominations==\n===Republican Party nomination===\n{{main|2020 Republican Party presidential primaries}}\n====Primaries====\nIn election cycles with incumbent presidents running for re-election, the race for their party nomination are usually ''pro-forma'', with token opposition instead of any serious challengers and with their party rules being fixed in their favor.<ref name=\"B1TfP\" /><ref name=\"politico20190506\" /> The 2020 election is no exception; with Donald Trump formally seeking a second term,<ref name=\"DFAz3\" /><ref name=\"VkToz\" /> the official Republican apparatus, both state and national, have coordinated with his campaign to implement changes to make it difficult for any primary opponent to mount a serious challenge.<ref name=\"ct7mA\" /><ref name=\"Rbspl\" /> On January 25, 2019, the [[Republican National Committee]] unofficially endorsed Trump.<ref name=\"u5OTG\" />\n\nSeveral Republican state committees have scrapped their respective primaries or caucuses.<ref name=\"politico20190906\" /> They have cited the fact that Republicans canceled several state primaries when [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]] sought a second term in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] and [[2004 Republican Party presidential primaries|2004]], respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] were seeking reelection in [[1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1996]] and [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2012]], respectively.<ref name=\"YYpWu\" /><ref name=\"b3RX8\" /> After cancelling their races, some of those states like Hawaii and New York immediately binded their delegates to Trump,<ref name=\"DzEs1\" /><ref name=\"0zsgw\" /> while other such states like Kansas and Nevada later formally held a convention or meeting to officially award their delegates to him.<ref name=\"cw1Ms\" /><ref name=\"vHq4G\" />\n\nIn addition, the Trump campaign urged Republican state committees that used proportional methods to award delegates in 2016 (where a state's delegates are basically divided proportionally among the candidates based on the vote percentage) to switch to a \"[[Plurality voting|winner-takes-all]]\" (where the winning candidate in a state gets all its delegates) or \"winner-takes-most\" (where the winning candidate only wins all of the state's delegates if he exceeds a predetermined amount, otherwise they are divided proportionally) for 2020.<ref name=\"politico20190506\" /><ref name=\"AP20190920\" />\n\nNevertheless, reports arose beginning in August 2017 that members of the Republican Party were preparing a \"shadow campaign\" against the President, particularly from the moderate or establishment wings of the party. Then-[[Arizona]] senator [[John McCain]] said, \"Republicans see weakness in this president.\"<ref name=\"wjjR6\" /><ref name=\"yDOhp\" /> [[Maine]] senator [[Susan Collins]], [[Kentucky]] senator [[Rand Paul]], and former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee, with Collins stating \"it's too difficult to say.\"<ref name=\"C9L6O\" /><ref name=\"f20FO\" /> Senator [[Jeff Flake]] claimed in 2017 that Trump was \"inviting\" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.<ref name=\"Ogmqz\" /> Longtime political strategist [[Roger Stone]], however, predicted in May 2018 that Trump might not seek a second term were he to succeed in keeping all his campaign promises and \"mak[ing] America great again\".<ref name=\"GxyXS\" />\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor [[Bill Weld]] then became Trump's first major challenger in the Republican primaries following an announcement on April 15, 2019.<ref name=\"1Ad6f\" /> Weld, who was the Libertarian Party's nominee for vice president in 2016, was considered a long shot because his [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] views on several political positions such as abortion rights, gay marriage and marijuana legalization that conflicted with traditionalist [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions.<ref name=\"oioUK\" />\n\nIn addition, businessman [[Rocky De La Fuente]] entered the race on May 16, 2019, but was not widely recognized as a major candidate.\n\nFormer Illinois [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|representative]] [[Joe Walsh (American politician)|Joe Walsh]] launched a primary challenge on August 25, 2019, saying, \"I'm going to do whatever I can. I don't want [Trump] to win. The country cannot afford to have him win. If I'm not successful, I'm not voting for him.\"<ref name=\"6L2x8\" /> Walsh ended his presidential bid on February 7, 2020, after drawing around 1% support in the Iowa caucuses. Walsh declared that \"nobody can beat Trump in a Republican primary\" because the Republican Party was now \"a cult\" of Trump. According to Walsh, Trump supporters had become \"followers\" who think that Trump \"can do no wrong\", after absorbing misinformation \"from 'conservative' media. They don't know what the truth is and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 they don't care.\"<ref name=\"iWwLJ\" />\n\nOn September 8, 2019, former South Carolina governor and representative [[Mark Sanford]] officially announced that he would be another Republican primary challenger to Trump.<ref name=\"NYTimesSanford\" /> He dropped out of the race 65 days later on November 12, 2019, after failing to gain support in Republican circles.<ref name=\"JE5vC\" />\n\nStill, [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|Donald Trump's re-election campaign]] has essentially been ongoing since his victory in 2016, leading pundits to describe his tactic of holding rallies continuously throughout his presidency as a \"never-ending campaign\".<ref name=\"kn3IR\" /> On January 20, 2017, at 5:11&nbsp;p.m., he submitted a letter as a substitute of FEC Form 2, by which he reached the legal threshold for filing, in compliance with the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]].<ref name=\"0ergM\" /> Trump has run an active campaign during the primary season, even holding rallies in the February primary states, including South Carolina and Nevada where those Republican races were canceled.<ref name=\"vckt4\" /><ref name=\"y1IrS\" />\n\nThrough Super Tuesday, March 3, Trump won every race. Including those states who have canceled their races and have awarded their delegates to him, Trump through Super Tuesday won an estimated 1,023 of the 1,276 required to officially become the presumptive Republican Party nominee.<ref name=\"RifKC\" /> After the March 10 primaries, he was a mere 11 delegates shy of clinching, which he did the following week. As of March 21, he has received 11,446,331 popular votes. \n\nOn March 17, 2020, having won enough delegates to ensure his nomination at the convention, Trump became the presumptive nominee.<ref name=\"u9rZ3\" /> Weld suspended his campaign the next day.<ref name=\"HCjk9\" />\n\n====Presumptive nominee==== \n{{Donald Trump series |expanded=Campaigns}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n\n| colspan=\"28\" style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" |\n\n[[File:Republican Disc.png|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''Presumptive 2020 Republican Party ticket\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Donald Trump}}\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Mike Pence}}\n|- style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#ffd0d7;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n| [[File:Official Portrait of President Donald Trump.jpg|center|200x200px|border]]<!-- DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT PRIOR CONSENSUS.

In 2018, several [[U.S. House]] districts that Democrats hoped to gain from the Republican majority had contentious primary elections. These clashes were described by ''[[Politico]]''{{'}}s Elena Schneider as a \"Democratic civil war\".<ref name=\"rlKMJ\" /> Meanwhile, there has been a general shift to the left in regards to college tuition, healthcare, and immigration among Democrats in the Senate, likely to build up credentials for the upcoming primary election.<ref name=\"gTbzW\" /><ref name=\"C7O7F\" />\n\nOverall, the 2020 primary field had 29 major candidates,<ref name=\"fkBz3\" /> breaking the record for the largest field under the modern presidential primary system previously set during the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 GOP primaries]] with 17 major candidates.<ref name=\"politifact2019\" /> Several female candidates entered the race, increasing the likelihood of the Democrats nominating a woman for the second time in a row.<ref name=\"IuwYR\" />\n\nEntering the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]] on February 3, 2020, however, the field had decreased to 11 major candidates. [[Pete Buttigieg]] narrowly defeated [[Bernie Sanders]] in Iowa, then Sanders edged Buttigieg in the February 11 [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]]. Following [[Michael Bennet]], [[Deval Patrick]], and [[Andrew Yang]] dropping out, Sanders won the [[2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses|Nevada caucuses]] on February 22. [[Joe Biden]] then won the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary|South Carolina primary]], causing Buttigieg, [[Amy Klobuchar]], and [[Tom Steyer]] to abandon their campaigns (Buttigieg and Klobuchar then immediately endorsed Biden). After [[Super Tuesday]], March 3, [[Michael Bloomberg]] and [[Elizabeth Warren]] quit the race, leaving three candidates left: Biden and Sanders, the main contenders, and [[Tulsi Gabbard]], who remained in the race despite facing nigh-on insurmountable odds.<ref name=\"cw3Ne\" /> Gabbard then dropped out and endorsed Biden after the March 17 [[2020 Arizona Democratic primary|Arizona]], [[2020 Florida Democratic primary|Florida]], and [[2020 Illinois Democratic primary|Illinois]] races.<ref name=\"2vZj6\" /> On April 8, 2020, Sanders dropped out, leaving Biden as the only major candidate remaining, and the presumptive nominee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/08/biden-sanders-2016-2020-176169|title=Biden moves quickly to exorcise \u2018the ghosts of 2016\u2019|website=Politico|last1=Caputo|first1=Marc|date=April 8, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Presumptive nominee==== \n{{Joe Biden series}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"30\" style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" |[[File:U.S. Democratic Party logo (transparent).svg|65px|center|link=Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party (United States)]]<big>'''Presumptive 2020 Democratic Party ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Joe Biden}}\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}};\"|{{colored link|white|2020 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection|TBD}}\n|- style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#c8ebff;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n|[[File:Joe Biden official portrait 2013 cropped.jpg|alt=|center|200x200px]]<!-- DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT PRIOR CONSENSUS.

Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.<ref name=\"JAb2o\" /><ref name=\"t9U5e\" /> On March 12, President Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.<ref name=\"NM4Ve\" /> The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the [[CNN]] studios in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"iUhTN\" /> Several states have also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,<ref name=\"2rHUH\" /> Kentucky,<ref name=\"BOyPg\" /> Louisiana,<ref name=\"9Jz7W\" /> Ohio,<ref name=\"YrwnH\" /> and Maryland.<ref name=\"slHNd\" /> As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates have halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over coronavirus concerns. Political analysts have stated that the moratorium on traditional campaigning coupled to the effects of the pandemic on the nation could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.<ref name=\"sXzhh\" /><ref name=\"u1jgH\" /><ref name=\"w7xk5\" />\n\nThe [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] included money for states to increase mail-in voting.<ref name=\"NQGai\" />\n\nGovernment response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled to the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act|economic stimulus]] remains a major campaign issue for both parties.<ref name=\"kLGv5\" /><ref name=\"jAPgE\" />\n\n==Nominations==\n===Republican Party nomination===\n{{main|2020 Republican Party presidential primaries}}\n====Primaries====\nIn election cycles with incumbent presidents running for re-election, the race for their party nomination are usually ''pro-forma'', with token opposition instead of any serious challengers and with their party rules being fixed in their favor.<ref name=\"B1TfP\" /><ref name=\"politico20190506\" /> The 2020 election is no exception; with Donald Trump formally seeking a second term,<ref name=\"DFAz3\" /><ref name=\"VkToz\" /> the official Republican apparatus, both state and national, have coordinated with his campaign to implement changes to make it difficult for any primary opponent to mount a serious challenge.<ref name=\"ct7mA\" /><ref name=\"Rbspl\" /> On January 25, 2019, the [[Republican National Committee]] unofficially endorsed Trump.<ref name=\"u5OTG\" />\n\nSeveral Republican state committees have scrapped their respective primaries or caucuses.<ref name=\"politico20190906\" /> They have cited the fact that Republicans canceled several state primaries when [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]] sought a second term in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] and [[2004 Republican Party presidential primaries|2004]], respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] were seeking reelection in [[1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1996]] and [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2012]], respectively.<ref name=\"YYpWu\" /><ref name=\"b3RX8\" /> After cancelling their races, some of those states like Hawaii and New York immediately binded their delegates to Trump,<ref name=\"DzEs1\" /><ref name=\"0zsgw\" /> while other such states like Kansas and Nevada later formally held a convention or meeting to officially award their delegates to him.<ref name=\"cw1Ms\" /><ref name=\"vHq4G\" />\n\nIn addition, the Trump campaign urged Republican state committees that used proportional methods to award delegates in 2016 (where a state's delegates are basically divided proportionally among the candidates based on the vote percentage) to switch to a \"[[Plurality voting|winner-takes-all]]\" (where the winning candidate in a state gets all its delegates) or \"winner-takes-most\" (where the winning candidate only wins all of the state's delegates if he exceeds a predetermined amount, otherwise they are divided proportionally) for 2020.<ref name=\"politico20190506\" /><ref name=\"AP20190920\" />\n\nNevertheless, reports arose beginning in August 2017 that members of the Republican Party were preparing a \"shadow campaign\" against the President, particularly from the moderate or establishment wings of the party. Then-[[Arizona]] senator [[John McCain]] said, \"Republicans see weakness in this president.\"<ref name=\"wjjR6\" /><ref name=\"yDOhp\" /> [[Maine]] senator [[Susan Collins]], [[Kentucky]] senator [[Rand Paul]], and former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee, with Collins stating \"it's too difficult to say.\"<ref name=\"C9L6O\" /><ref name=\"f20FO\" /> Senator [[Jeff Flake]] claimed in 2017 that Trump was \"inviting\" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.<ref name=\"Ogmqz\" /> Longtime political strategist [[Roger Stone]], however, predicted in May 2018 that Trump might not seek a second term were he to succeed in keeping all his campaign promises and \"mak[ing] America great again\".<ref name=\"GxyXS\" />\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor [[Bill Weld]] then became Trump's first major challenger in the Republican primaries following an announcement on April 15, 2019.<ref name=\"1Ad6f\" /> Weld, who was the Libertarian Party's nominee for vice president in 2016, was considered a long shot because his [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] views on several political positions such as abortion rights, gay marriage and marijuana legalization that conflicted with traditionalist [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions.<ref name=\"oioUK\" />\n\nIn addition, businessman [[Rocky De La Fuente]] entered the race on May 16, 2019, but was not widely recognized as a major candidate.\n\nFormer Illinois [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|representative]] [[Joe Walsh (American politician)|Joe Walsh]] launched a primary challenge on August 25, 2019, saying, \"I'm going to do whatever I can. I don't want [Trump] to win. The country cannot afford to have him win. If I'm not successful, I'm not voting for him.\"<ref name=\"6L2x8\" /> Walsh ended his presidential bid on February 7, 2020, after drawing around 1% support in the Iowa caucuses. Walsh declared that \"nobody can beat Trump in a Republican primary\" because the Republican Party was now \"a cult\" of Trump. According to Walsh, Trump supporters had become \"followers\" who think that Trump \"can do no wrong\", after absorbing misinformation \"from 'conservative' media. They don't know what the truth is and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 they don't care.\"<ref name=\"iWwLJ\" />\n\nOn September 8, 2019, former South Carolina governor and representative [[Mark Sanford]] officially announced that he would be another Republican primary challenger to Trump.<ref name=\"NYTimesSanford\" /> He dropped out of the race 65 days later on November 12, 2019, after failing to gain support in Republican circles.<ref name=\"JE5vC\" />\n\nStill, [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|Donald Trump's re-election campaign]] has essentially been ongoing since his victory in 2016, leading pundits to describe his tactic of holding rallies continuously throughout his presidency as a \"never-ending campaign\".<ref name=\"kn3IR\" /> On January 20, 2017, at 5:11&nbsp;p.m., he submitted a letter as a substitute of FEC Form 2, by which he reached the legal threshold for filing, in compliance with the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]].<ref name=\"0ergM\" /> Trump has run an active campaign during the primary season, even holding rallies in the February primary states, including South Carolina and Nevada where those Republican races were canceled.<ref name=\"vckt4\" /><ref name=\"y1IrS\" />\n\nThrough Super Tuesday, March 3, Trump won every race. Including those states who have canceled their races and have awarded their delegates to him, Trump through Super Tuesday won an estimated 1,023 of the 1,276 required to officially become the presumptive Republican Party nominee.<ref name=\"RifKC\" /> After the March 10 primaries, he was a mere 11 delegates shy of clinching, which he did the following week. As of March 21, he has received 11,446,331 popular votes. \n\nOn March 17, 2020, having won enough delegates to ensure his nomination at the convention, Trump became the presumptive nominee.<ref name=\"u9rZ3\" /> Weld suspended his campaign the next day.<ref name=\"HCjk9\" />\n\n====Presumptive nominee==== \n{{Donald Trump series |expanded=Campaigns}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n\n| colspan=\"28\" style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" |\n\n[[File:Republican Disc.png|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''Presumptive 2020 Republican Party ticket\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Donald Trump}}\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Mike Pence}}\n|- style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#ffd0d7;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n| [[File:Official Portrait of President Donald Trump.jpg|center|200x200px|border]]<!-- DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT PRIOR CONSENSUS.
