The main essential resources for animals are food, water, and territory. For plants, key resources include sunlight, nutrients, water, and a place to grow.<ref name= Ricklefs/> Resources can be consumed by an organism and, as a result, become unavailable to other organisms. Competition for resource varies from [[size-asymmetric competition|complete symmetric]] (all individuals receive the same amount of resources, irrespective of their size) to [[size-asymmetric competition|perfectly size symmetric]] (all individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass) to absolutely [[size-asymmetric competition|size-asymmetric]] (the largest individuals exploit all the available resource). The degree of size asymmetry has major effects on the structure and diversity of ecological communities, e.g. in plant communities size-asymmetric competition for light has stronger effects on diversity compared with competition for soil resources. The degree of size asymmetry has major effects on the structure and diversity of ecological communities.\n\n===Economic versus biological===\n\nThere are three fundamental differences between economic versus ecological views: 1) the economic resource definition is human-centered ([[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]]) and the biological or ecological resource definition is nature-centered ([[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentric]] or [[ecocentric]]); 2) the economic view includes desire along with necessity, whereas the biological view is about basic biological needs; and 3) economic systems are based on markets of currency exchanged for goods and services, whereas biological systems are based on natural processes of growth, maintenance, and reproduction.<ref name=Miller/>\n\n==Computer resources==\n{{Main article|Resource (computer science)}}\n\nA [[Resource (computer science)|computer resource]] is any physical or virtual component of limited availability within a [[computer]] or [[information management]] system.

Many natural resources are essential for human survival, while others are used for satisfying human desire. Conservation is management of [[natural resources]] with the goal of [[sustainability]]. Natural resources may be further classified in different ways.<ref name=Miller/>\n\nResources can be categorized on the basis of origin:\n* Abiotic resources comprise non-living things (e.g., [[Land (economics)|land]], [[water]], [[air]] and [[minerals]] such as gold, iron, copper, silver).\n* Biotic resources are obtained from the [[biosphere]]. Forests and their products, animals, birds and their products, [[fish]] and other marine organisms are important examples. [[Minerals]] such as coal and [[petroleum]] are sometimes included in this category because they were formed from fossilized organic matter, though over long periods of time.\n\nNatural resources are also categorized based on the stage of development:\n* Potential resources are known to exist and may be used in the future. For example, [[petroleum]] may exist in many parts of India and Kuwait that have sedimentary rocks, but until the time it is actually drilled out and put into use, it remains a potential resource.\n* Actual resources are those that have been surveyed, their quantity and quality determined, and are being used in present times. For example, petroleum and natural gas is actively being obtained from the Mumbai High Fields. The development of an actual resource, such as [[wood processing]] depends upon the technology available and the [[cost]] involved. That part of the actual resource that can be developed profitably with available technology is known as a reserve resource, while that part that can not be developed profitably because of lack of technology is known as a stock resource.\n\nNatural resources can be categorized on the basis of renewability:\n*[https://studyzoneallsolutions.blogspot.com/2020/04/resources-and-development-of-class-10-resource-and-development-class-10-geography-class-10-chapter-1-geography-class-10-chapter-1-notes-geography-class-10-chapter-1-notes-in-hindi-class-10-geography-chapter-1-notes-in-hindi-pdf-download.html Non-renewable resources] are formed over very long [[geological period]]s. Minerals and fossils are included in this category. Since their rate of formation is extremely slow, they cannot be replenished, once they are [[resource depletion|depleted]]. Out of these, the metallic minerals can be re-used by recycling them, but coal and petroleum cannot be recycled.\n*[https://studyzoneallsolutions.blogspot.com/2020/04/resources-and-development-of-class-10-resource-and-development-class-10-geography-class-10-chapter-1-geography-class-10-chapter-1-notes-geography-class-10-chapter-1-notes-in-hindi-class-10-geography-chapter-1-notes-in-hindi-pdf-download.html Renewable resources,] such as forests and fisheries, can be replenished or reproduced relatively quickly. The highest rate at which a resource can be used sustainably is the [[sustainable yield]]. Some resources, such as sunlight, air, and wind, are called perpetual resources because they are available continuously, though at a limited rate. Their quantity is not affected by human consumption. Many renewable resources can be depleted by human use, but may also be replenished, thus maintaining a flow. Some of these, such as agricultural crops, take a short time for renewal; others, such as water, take a comparatively longer time, while still others, such as forests, take even longer.\n\nDependent upon the speed and quantity of consumption, overconsumption can lead to depletion or total and everlasting destruction of a resource. Important examples are agricultural areas, fish and other animals, forests, healthy water and soil, cultivated and natural landscapes. Such conditionally renewable resources are sometimes classified as a third kind of resource, or as a subtype of renewable resources. Conditionally renewable resources are presently subject to excess human consumption and the only sustainable long term use of such resources is within the so-called [[Ecological footprint|zero ecological footprint]], wherein human use less than the Earth's ecological capacity to regenerate.\n\nNatural resources are also categorized based on distribution:\n* Ubiquitous resources are found everywhere (for example air, light, and water).\n* Localized resources are found only in certain parts of the world (for example metal ores and geothermal power).\n\nActual vs. potential natural resources are distinguished as follows:\n* Actual resources are those resources whose location and quantity are known and we have the technology to exploit and use them.\n* Potential resources are the ones of which we have insufficient knowledge or we do not have the technology to exploit them at present.\n\nOn the basis of ownership, resources can be classified as individual, community, national, and international.\n\n==Labour or human resources==\nIn economics, labor or [[human resources]] refers to the human effort in the production of goods and rendering of services.
