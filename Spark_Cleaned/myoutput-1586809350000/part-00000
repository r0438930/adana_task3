Located approximately 30 miles (50&nbsp;km) east of London, it falls within the [[Borough of Basildon]] along with the original town of [[Basildon]], [[Billericay]], [[Laindon]] and [[Pitsea]]. However, parts of Wickford fall under neighbouring districts such as Chelmsford and Rochford.\n\nWickford has become a [[commuter town]], serving the City of London through [[Wickford railway station|its railway station's]] direct connection to [[Liverpool Street station]] through the [[Shenfield to Southend Line|Southend Victoria line]], on which a train to London takes approximately 40 minutes. The town can also be easily reached via the road network by the [[A127 road|A127]] between London and [[Southend-on-Sea]] or by the [[A130 road|A130]] from [[Chelmsford]].\n\nWickford is a fairly small town with a main high street including a range of shops. It also has a swimming pool, library, open-air market and a community centre within the vicinity of the town centre.\n\nWickford also incorporates a small estate called [[Shotgate]], which is home to many residents. Shotgate features a row of village shops and a children's play area and park.\n\n== History ==\nWickford has a history going back over two thousand years. There is evidence that the area itself was inhabited in [[prehistoric]] times probably by a tribe of Britons called [[Trinovantes]]. There was a Roman military marching camp on the Beauchamps Farm site, which was succeeded by a Roman villa. This is now the site of [[Beauchamps High School]]. This area on higher ground was the historic core of Wickford, the site of the manor house and the parish church of St Catherine's. Over time the commercial centre of Wickford has migrated westwards, towards the modern High Street on the other side of the [[River Crouch]].<ref name=time>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VZaIAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT5|title=Wickford and Around Through Time\n|last=Rayment|first=David|date=17 October 2013|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|accessdate=18 November 2015|isbn=9781445632254\n}}</ref>\n\nThe place-name Wickford is first attested in a Saxon charter of 995, where it appears as ''Wicford''.

As of present only the northern side of the station facing The Broadway is easily accessible, with the southern London-bound track only accessible from the outside though a small out-of-way footpath from Market Avenue as a courteous entrance for wheelchair-using passengers.\n\nPublic and health services would be improved under the scheme, with the re-organisation of existing health, library and community services into a new 'iconic' building to the east of Market Avenue as an integrated community service facility.\n\nThe Eastern Extension would create a better presence and new linkages to the east of the town centre by redeveloping the car park into a multi-storey development with residential and live-work uses and a new housing scheme to the east of Wickford Bypass. The Southern Gateway area, which surrounds London Road and the southern end of the High Street, are also planned to undergo a transition with a strong leisure and recreational theme, building on existing eating and drinking facilities and incorporating compatible residential uses.\n\nOverall 650 apartments are planned to be built as part of the Masterplan as officially stated by [[councillor]] Tony Ball,<ref name=\"echo1\"/> although other sources opposed to the project claim this figure is closer to 735.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrc-websites.co.uk/wickford/05_mp_tally.htm|title=Masterplan \u2013 the current total|accessdate=15 February 2010|publisher=Wickford Action Group}}</ref>\n\n===Opposition===\nThe Masterplan has met with resistance with many residents of Wickford, mainly due to overall cost, and also the fear from some older residents that raising the level of the river could see repeats of the floods in 1958 and 1960.\n\nThere have also been criticism over the number of developments being constructed, which some say threaten to overdevelop and cause environmental and aesthetic damage to the town centre whilst providing minimal improvements to public services; one such group is the Wickford Action Group who has campaigned against many of the revisions made prior to the public approval of the plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrc-websites.co.uk/wickford/05_mp.htm|title=Masterplan \u2013 the current total|accessdate=15 February 2010|publisher=Wickford action Group}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrc-websites.co.uk/wickford/05_mp.htm|title=Fears for Wickford|date=26 March 2007|accessdate=15 February 2010|publisher=Echo}}</ref>\n\n===Progress===\nConstruction began in earnest in February 2007, which saw the demolition of many of the buildings in Lower Southend Road to make way for a new residential area. As of December 2009 this development has been partially completed (Riverside Place phase 1 + Riverside Court), however the [[compulsory purchase order]] of the post sorting office has been withdrawn leaving the fate of Riverside Place Phase 2 in doubt.\n\nAs of April 2010, the whole of the Masterplan project is facing serious delays and construction has halted due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|global financial crisis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/4069123.Wickford_Masterplan_may_be_put_back_again/|title=Wickford Masterplan may be put back again|accessdate=12 March 2009|publisher=Echo News|date=23 January 2009}}</ref> In May 2009 the construction company Bradgate Developments released a statement assuring residents the project was still on track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/latestnews/WICKFORD-Builders-vow-flats-plan-ahead/article-984693-detail/article.html|title=WICKFORD: Builders vow flats plan will go ahead|accessdate=12 March 2009|publisher=This Is Total Essex.co.uk|date=12 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Proposed super-max prison==\nThe plans by the previous Labour government to build on land near the Runwell Hospital [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institute]] a prison capable of accommodating up to 1,500 inmates have since been shelved.
