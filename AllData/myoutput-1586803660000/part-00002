In the unskilled occupations Eastern Europeans reached the national mean in 1961.}}</ref> Cultural assimilation of Eastern Europeans was increasingly common in mid-20th-century North America. Professor [[Marc Shell]] has written regarding the Canadian government's enforcement of the [[anglicisation of names]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Marc Shell|authorlink=Marc Shell|title=Polio and Its Aftermath: The Paralysis of Culture|date=2005|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=978-0674013155|chapter=One Polio Story|page=55|quote=I became [[de jure]] Mark Shell in 1967 by means of an official [[Order of Council]]. (Such name changes were not untypical among assimilating Eastern Europeans in Canada.)}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, Eastern Europeans were also gradually being accepted into mainstream American culture. Historian [[David Halberstam]], speaking in a [[New England Board of Higher Education]] interview, discussed how access to [[white society]] became plausible for the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nebhe.org/fall-2005-connection-50-years-of-new-england-higher-education-and-economic-development/|title=Fall 2005 Connection: 50 Years of New England Higher Education and Economic Development|date=September 26, 2013|publisher=[[New England Board of Higher Education]]|quote= But in retrospect, it was narrower than we thought. We perceived ourselves in the \u201850s as a white society, and the breakthrough was mostly limited to people who were descendents of Italian-Americans, Eastern European Americans, children of Jewish immigrants.\u201d}}</ref> Perhaps respresenting this social change best, the [[US Census Bureau]] found that the Eastern European  born in this time period (between 1956 and 1965) were indistinguishable, in education results, with [[British Americans]].  Eastern European Americans were found to have also outperformed US citizens of solely British heritage in the completion of [[bachelor's degrees]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dominic J.

However, the percentages had virtually converged for two groups in this cohort: men of solely [[British ancestry]] (66.3% and 31.8%, respectively) and Southern and Eastern European men (66.4% and 33.8%, respectively). Interestingly, these trends were reflected in the data for women too. While the [[Southern European Americans|Southern]] and Eastern European Americans began to prosper in America, [[African Americans]] continued to suffer from discrimination and diminished life chances}}</ref>\n\n====Late 20th-century====\nDuring the 1970s, the majority of Eastern Europeans resident in Canada lived in the country's main urban centers.
