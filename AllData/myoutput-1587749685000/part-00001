Most states have not recognised them as being Russian territory.\n\nThe administrative division in Ukraine was [[Administrative divisions of the Ukrainian SSR|directly inherited]] (grandfathered) from the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|local republican]] administration of the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], and has not changed significantly since the middle of the 20th century. It is somewhat complex, as beside having several levels of a territorial subdivision it also has a classification for various [[Populated places in Ukraine|populated places]], particularly [[Cities of Ukraine|cities]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{confusing|date=December 2014}}\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}\n{{See also|Local government in Ukraine}}\n[[File:Administrative divisions of Ukraine improved.jpg|thumb|400px|Simple flow chart of administrative divisions of Ukraine]]\n\nAccording to the Article 133 of [[Constitution of Ukraine]], \"the system of the administrative and territorial structure of Ukraine is composed of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, oblasts, districts, cities, districts in city, settlements, and villages.\" Note, that although certain types of subdivision are not mentioned in Constitution of Ukraine (i.e. rural settlements), they are mentioned for regional composition. Also, for disambiguation regular raions (districts) are sometimes denoted as rural to distinguish them from raions in city.<ref name=regions/>\n\nUkraine's administrative divisions are divided as follows:\n*By geographical characteristics the units are divided on regions (such as autonomous republic, oblasts, districts, cities with special status) and places of settlement (cities, towns, villages).\n*By their status they can be administrative-territorial units (oblasts and districts), self-governed territorial units (cities, towns, villages). Also the autonomous republic has a unique status of territorial autonomy, while districts in cities combine both characteristics of administrative territorial as well as self-governed territorial units.\n*By position in the system of administrative division of Ukraine, the units divided into territorial units of ''prime level'' (cities w/o district division, districts in cities, towns, villages), of ''middle level'' (districts, cities with district division), and of ''higher level'' (autonomous republic, oblasts, cities with special status).\n*Administrative division has changed because some territories are not under the control of the government. For example, Sievierodonetsk has become the new central regional center.\n\nRegions, cities, districts are governed by a state administration, a chief of which is appointed by the president after a nomination by the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|cabinet of ministers]].<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/382028.html Poroshenko to sign Saakashvili\u2019s resignation if Cabinet submits motion], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (7 November 2016)</ref> Crimea has its own cabinet of ministers, however the state administration is represented by the office of the Presidential Representative of Ukraine. A basic and the lowest level of administrative division is a settlement that is governed by a local council (rada). Cities as a settlement always carry a special status within a region and have their own form of self-administration (municipality \u2013 ''vykonkom'') and some may consist of their own city's districts (raions). City municipalities are governed by a mayor and a city council (miskrada). Some smaller cities, towns, and rural localities may be under control of city municipalities based on larger cities. Towns as well as villages are not controlled by state administration and are self-governed by either a town council (selyshchna rada) or a village council (silrada) within the limits of the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine (article 140 of the Constitution of Ukraine). Village councils may carry a combined jurisdiction which may include several villages and hamlets (selyshche). Unlike villages, each town council always has a separate jurisdiction which may be part of bigger city's council. Hamlet (selyshche) is a non-governed rural locality and is governed by a village council of nearby village.\n\n===Table===\nUkraine is divided into 3 main administrative divisions: [[oblast]] (region), [[raion]] (district), and council (city, settlement, and village). Note, settlements such as cities do not necessary constitute the basic level of the Ukrainian administrative territorial system. For that purpose cities are categorized into own three categories that correspond to each level of subdivisions. Cities with special status and regional significance beside being divided into special districts in city may also include smaller cities (district significance), settlements, and/or villages. Please, note that the settlement's population size is not the only factor for its status. The final decision on status change is carried out by the [[Ukrainian parliament]].

Excluded in the administrative changes was [[Western Ukraine]], which at that time formed part of the [[Second Polish Republic]] and shared in the Polish form of administrative division based on [[Voivodeships of Poland|voivodeships]].\n\nIn the post-[[World War II]] period, the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] consisted of [[Administrative divisions of the Ukrainian SSR|25 oblasts and two cities with special status]].\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Crimea obtained the status of an autonomous republic with its own government instead of a regional state administration.\n\n==Regions==\n{{Ukraine Labelled Map|float=right}}\n\n===Autonomous republic===\n{{Main|Autonomous Republic of Crimea}}\n\nThe Autonomous Republic of Crimea, formerly the Crimean Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR, geographically encompasses the major portion of the Crimean peninsula in southern [[Ukraine]]. Its capital is [[Simferopol]]. The Autonomous Republic of Crimea is the only region within Ukraine that possesses its own constitution.\n\nOn March 16, 2014, after the occupation of Crimea by the Russian military, a referendum on joining the Russian Federation was conducted. A majority of votes supported the measure. On March 21, 2014, the Russian Duma voted to annex Crimea as a [[Republic of Crimea|subject]] into the Russian Federation. The Ukrainian government does not recognize the referendum or annexation of Crimea as legitimate. On March 27, the UN General Assembly passed [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262|Resolution 68/262]] by 100 to 11 votes, recognizing the referendum as invalid and denying any legal change in the status of Crimea and Sevastopol.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ddd; vertical-align:top;\"\n!

For the sake of brevity, urbanized settlements are sometimes classified as towns in the [[English language]].\n\nChanges to a settlement's status can be made only by the [[Verkhovna Rada]]. Please note that the size of a settlement does not ultimately define its status, although is a major factor. For example, the city of [[Prypiat (city)|Prypiat]] still retains its status, while having a population of zero, due to its infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and utility networks.\n\nThe typical Ukrainian ''misto'' ought to be considered a [[city]], not a [[town]] (compare to [[City status in the United Kingdom]]). However, the city's subordination to either an oblast or raion also should be taken into account, especially in the [[political]] sense. Some of urbanized settlements may be cities of raion subordination, although it could seem confusing, a type of settlement should be considered first as its status is given for administrative purposes.\n\n===Cities===\n{{see also|List of cities in Ukraine}}\n[[File:Kyiv province location map.svg|thumb|left|[[Kiev Oblast|Kyiv Oblast]] for instance, has several regional city municipalities such as [[Pereiaslav]], for example, that are under direct subordination to the regional authorities.

Blinnikov, [[Guilford Press]], 2010, {{ISBN|1606239201}} (page 151)</ref> Cities may carry various status. Some may be of national importance, others of [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|regional (oblast) importance]], and the rest of district (raion) importance. For example, the cities of ''Kyiv'' and of ''Sevastopol'' have special status of national significance and each is officially classified as a ''city with a special status'', which administratively is equivalent to an oblast. Mayors of those cities, in general, as are governors of oblasts, are appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]]. However, the status of the mayor of Kyiv is somewhat more complex, and for further information see [[Legal status and local government of Kiev|Legal status and local government of Kyiv]]. The status of Sevastopol is also unique.\n\nAlmost every oblast has at least one city of regional subordination (importance), which is the administrative center (capital) of that oblast. However, some other big cities within the oblast may have such status as well. The cities of oblast subordination have the same importance of a raion, and often are the administrative centers of such. In addition to regular raions, several Ukrainian cities with national or oblast status are further divided into ''city raions'' which may include other cities, towns, and/or villages. In 2010, Ukraine had 23 such cities with their own city raions.\n\nMany '''raions''' also have city municipalities of its level of subordination (importance). Those are usually the administrative centers (capitals). Notice that not all raions have a city as their administrative center; however all the raion centers are at least urban-like (urbanized). All administrative centers have their own form of self-administration. The municipalities of a raion subordination may administer several adjacent local councils (municipalities), usually rural. If a raion has several cities of raion (district) level, they may share administrative power for the raion.\n\n===Other municipalities===\nIn addition to city municipalities, Ukraine has urban-like municipalities. The lowest form of self-administration are the rural municipalities and villages. A rural municipality may consist of a single village, usually big, or a combination of other rural villages or localities. Note that some villages also have some additional, very small settlements. Those settlements, together with the home village, combine a local (rural) municipality (silrada). For simplicity's sake, a silrada (rural municipality) is usually referred to as a village and is the lowest level of administrative division. The status of any settlement is granted by the [[Verkhovna Rada]].\n\n===Amalgamated hromadas (AHs)===\nIn his draft [[Ukraine's constitution|constitutional]] amendments of June 2014 [[Ukrainian President]] [[Petro Poroshenko]] proposed changing the administrative divisions of Ukraine, which should include regions, districts and \"hromadas\".<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/211043.html Poroshenko suggests granting status of regions to Crimea, Kyiv, Sevastopol, creating new political subdivision of 'community'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701043549/http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/211043.html |date=2014-07-01 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (26 June 2014)</ref>\n\nOn February 5, 2015, the law \"On voluntary association of territorial communities\" was adopted creating ''Amalgamated hromadas (communities)'' meaning [[Settlement council (Ukraine)|settlement councils]], [[Rural council (Ukraine)|rural councils]] and a [[City of district significance (Ukraine)|city of district significance]] can create a new administrative unit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reformsguide.org.ua/reforms/decentralizationreform/|title=Decentralization|date=2017-02-10|website=The Reforms Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref> Any amalgamated hromada with a city as an administrative centre is an urban hromada, any amalgamated hromada with an urban-type settlement as an administrative centre is a settlement hromada, and any amalgamated hromada with a village as an administrative centre is a rural hromada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://decentralization.gov.ua/en/glossary|title=Glossary|date=|website=Decentralization Reform|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref> New local [[elections in Ukraine|elections]] in these united territorial communities were then held.<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/472770.html Batkivschyna party says it gets most votes at local elections], [[Interfax Ukraine]] (25 December 2017)<br>[https://www.unian.info/politics/2316594-police-investigate-voter-bribing-cases-as-local-elections-held-in-51-territorial-communities.html Police investigate voter bribing cases as local elections held in 51 territorial communities], [[UNIAN]] (25 December 2017)</ref> 226 will be holding elections in 2018 and 2019.<ref>[http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/elections-are-around-the-corner-and-ukraine-s-political-parties-are-not-ready-2 Elections Are Around the Corner, and Ukraine\u2019s Political Parties Are Not Ready], [[Atlantic Council]] (6 December 2017)</ref> The first 252 were held in 2017.<ref>[https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45055-interim-report-on-observation-results-of-the-first-local-elections-in-united-territorial-communities-on-29-october-2017-19102017-26102017 INTERIM REPORT ON OBSERVATION RESULTS OF THE FIRST LOCAL ELECTIONS IN UNITED TERRITORIAL COMMUNITIES ON 29 October 2017 (19.10.2017 26.10.2017)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228223135/https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45055-interim-report-on-observation-results-of-the-first-local-elections-in-united-territorial-communities-on-29-october-2017-19102017-26102017 |date=28 December 2018 }}, [[PORA#OPORA|OPORA]] (31 October 2017)<br>[https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45165-ukraine-holds-elections-in-51-utcs-today Ukraine holds elections in 51 UTCs today] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226020921/https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45165-ukraine-holds-elections-in-51-utcs-today |date=2017-12-26 }}, [[PORA#OPORA|OPORA]] (24 December 2017)</ref> \n\nThe Law \"On Local Self-Government in Ukraine\" stipulates that local budgets should have enough money to be administered by local self-government bodies.<ref name=\"Espresogr\"/> Because many of the small rural councils and cities of district significance could never hope to do this the new administrative unit ''Amalgamated hromada'' ([https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B1%27%D1%94%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%96%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0]{{lang-uk|\u041e\u0431'\u0454\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0430}}, ''Obyednana terytorial\u02b9na hromada'') was created.<ref name=\"Espresogr\">{{in lang|uk}} [https://espreso.tv/article/2017/10/30/vybory_v_obyednanykh_terytorialnykh_gromadakh_scho_ce_i_dlya_chogo_potribne Elections in the united territorial communities.

It is somewhat complex, as beside having several levels of a territorial subdivision it also has a classification for various [[Populated places in Ukraine|populated places]], particularly [[Cities of Ukraine|cities]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{confusing|date=December 2014}}\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}\n{{See also|Local government in Ukraine}}\n[[File:Administrative divisions of Ukraine improved.jpg|thumb|400px|Simple flow chart of administrative divisions of Ukraine]]\n\nAccording to the Article 133 of [[Constitution of Ukraine]], \"the system of the administrative and territorial structure of Ukraine is composed of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, oblasts, districts, cities, districts in city, settlements, and villages.\" Note, that although certain types of subdivision are not mentioned in Constitution of Ukraine (i.e. rural settlements), they are mentioned for regional composition. Also, for disambiguation regular raions (districts) are sometimes denoted as rural to distinguish them from raions in city.<ref name=regions/>\n\nUkraine's administrative divisions are divided as follows:\n*By geographical characteristics the units are divided on regions (such as autonomous republic, oblasts, districts, cities with special status) and places of settlement (cities, towns, villages).\n*By their status they can be administrative-territorial units (oblasts and districts), self-governed territorial units (cities, towns, villages). Also the autonomous republic has a unique status of territorial autonomy, while districts in cities combine both characteristics of administrative territorial as well as self-governed territorial units.\n*By position in the system of administrative division of Ukraine, the units divided into territorial units of ''prime level'' (cities w/o district division, districts in cities, towns, villages), of ''middle level'' (districts, cities with district division), and of ''higher level'' (autonomous republic, oblasts, cities with special status).\n*Administrative division has changed because some territories are not under the control of the government. For example, Sievierodonetsk has become the new central regional center.\n\nRegions, cities, districts are governed by a state administration, a chief of which is appointed by the president after a nomination by the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|cabinet of ministers]].<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/382028.html Poroshenko to sign Saakashvili\u2019s resignation if Cabinet submits motion], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (7 November 2016)</ref> Crimea has its own cabinet of ministers, however the state administration is represented by the office of the Presidential Representative of Ukraine. A basic and the lowest level of administrative division is a settlement that is governed by a local council (rada). Cities as a settlement always carry a special status within a region and have their own form of self-administration (municipality \u2013 ''vykonkom'') and some may consist of their own city's districts (raions). City municipalities are governed by a mayor and a city council (miskrada). Some smaller cities, towns, and rural localities may be under control of city municipalities based on larger cities. Towns as well as villages are not controlled by state administration and are self-governed by either a town council (selyshchna rada) or a village council (silrada) within the limits of the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine (article 140 of the Constitution of Ukraine). Village councils may carry a combined jurisdiction which may include several villages and hamlets (selyshche). Unlike villages, each town council always has a separate jurisdiction which may be part of bigger city's council. Hamlet (selyshche) is a non-governed rural locality and is governed by a village council of nearby village.\n\n===Table===\nUkraine is divided into 3 main administrative divisions: [[oblast]] (region), [[raion]] (district), and council (city, settlement, and village). Note, settlements such as cities do not necessary constitute the basic level of the Ukrainian administrative territorial system. For that purpose cities are categorized into own three categories that correspond to each level of subdivisions. Cities with special status and regional significance beside being divided into special districts in city may also include smaller cities (district significance), settlements, and/or villages. Please, note that the settlement's population size is not the only factor for its status. The final decision on status change is carried out by the [[Ukrainian parliament]].

The Ukrainian government does not recognize the referendum or annexation of Crimea as legitimate.

Urban populated areas (\u043c\u0456\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0442) can be either a city (\u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442o) or an [[urban-type settlement]] (\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0438\u043f\u0443). For the sake of brevity, urbanized settlements are sometimes classified as towns in the [[English language]].\n\nChanges to a settlement's status can be made only by the [[Verkhovna Rada]]. Please note that the size of a settlement does not ultimately define its status, although is a major factor. For example, the city of [[Prypiat (city)|Prypiat]] still retains its status, while having a population of zero, due to its infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and utility networks.\n\nThe typical Ukrainian ''misto'' ought to be considered a [[city]], not a [[town]] (compare to [[City status in the United Kingdom]]). However, the city's subordination to either an oblast or raion also should be taken into account, especially in the [[political]] sense. Some of urbanized settlements may be cities of raion subordination, although it could seem confusing, a type of settlement should be considered first as its status is given for administrative purposes.\n\n===Cities===\n{{see also|List of cities in Ukraine}}\n[[File:Kyiv province location map.svg|thumb|left|[[Kiev Oblast]] for instance, has several regional city municipalities such as [[Pereiaslav]], for example, that are under direct subordination to the regional authorities.

Blinnikov, [[Guilford Press]], 2010, {{ISBN|1606239201}} (page 151)</ref> Cities may carry various status. Some may be of national importance, others of [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|regional (oblast) importance]], and the rest of district (raion) importance. For example, the cities of ''Kiev'' and of ''Sevastopol'' have special status of national significance and each is officially classified as a ''city with a special status'', which administratively is equivalent to an oblast. Mayors of those cities, in general, as are governors of oblasts, are appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]]. However, the status of the mayor of Kiev is somewhat more complex, and for further information see [[Legal status and local government of Kiev]]. The status of Sevastopol is also unique.\n\nAlmost every oblast has at least one city of regional subordination (importance), which is the administrative center (capital) of that oblast. However, some other big cities within the oblast may have such status as well. The cities of oblast subordination have the same importance of a raion, and often are the administrative centers of such. In addition to regular raions, several Ukrainian cities with national or oblast status are further divided into ''city raions'' which may include other cities, towns, and/or villages. In 2010, Ukraine had 23 such cities with their own city raions.\n\nMany '''raions''' also have city municipalities of its level of subordination (importance). Those are usually the administrative centers (capitals). Notice that not all raions have a city as their administrative center; however all the raion centers are at least urban-like (urbanized). All administrative centers have their own form of self-administration. The municipalities of a raion subordination may administer several adjacent local councils (municipalities), usually rural. If a raion has several cities of raion (district) level, they may share administrative power for the raion.\n\n===Other municipalities===\nIn addition to city municipalities, Ukraine has urban-like municipalities. The lowest form of self-administration are the rural municipalities and villages. A rural municipality may consist of a single village, usually big, or a combination of other rural villages or localities. Note that some villages also have some additional, very small settlements. Those settlements, together with the home village, combine a local (rural) municipality (silrada). For simplicity's sake, a silrada (rural municipality) is usually referred to as a village and is the lowest level of administrative division. The status of any settlement is granted by the [[Verkhovna Rada]].\n\n===Amalgamated hromadas (AHs)===\nIn his draft [[Ukraine's constitution|constitutional]] amendments of June 2014 [[Ukrainian President]] [[Petro Poroshenko]] proposed changing the administrative divisions of Ukraine, which should include regions, districts and \"hromadas\".<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/211043.html Poroshenko suggests granting status of regions to Crimea, Kyiv, Sevastopol, creating new political subdivision of 'community'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701043549/http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/211043.html |date=2014-07-01 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (26 June 2014)</ref>\n\nOn February 5, 2015, the law \"On voluntary association of territorial communities\" was adopted creating ''Amalgamated hromadas (communities)'' meaning [[Settlement council (Ukraine)|settlement councils]], [[Rural council (Ukraine)|rural councils]] and a [[City of district significance (Ukraine)|city of district significance]] can create a new administrative unit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reformsguide.org.ua/reforms/decentralizationreform/|title=Decentralization|date=2017-02-10|website=The Reforms Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref> Any amalgamated hromada with a city as an administrative centre is an urban hromada, any amalgamated hromada with an urban-type settlement as an administrative centre is a settlement hromada, and any amalgamated hromada with a village as an administrative centre is a rural hromada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://decentralization.gov.ua/en/glossary|title=Glossary|date=|website=Decentralization Reform|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref> New local [[elections in Ukraine|elections]] in these united territorial communities were then held.<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/472770.html Batkivschyna party says it gets most votes at local elections], [[Interfax Ukraine]] (25 December 2017)<br>[https://www.unian.info/politics/2316594-police-investigate-voter-bribing-cases-as-local-elections-held-in-51-territorial-communities.html Police investigate voter bribing cases as local elections held in 51 territorial communities], [[UNIAN]] (25 December 2017)</ref> 226 will be holding elections in 2018 and 2019.<ref>[http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/elections-are-around-the-corner-and-ukraine-s-political-parties-are-not-ready-2 Elections Are Around the Corner, and Ukraine\u2019s Political Parties Are Not Ready], [[Atlantic Council]] (6 December 2017)</ref> The first 252 were held in 2017.<ref>[https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45055-interim-report-on-observation-results-of-the-first-local-elections-in-united-territorial-communities-on-29-october-2017-19102017-26102017 INTERIM REPORT ON OBSERVATION RESULTS OF THE FIRST LOCAL ELECTIONS IN UNITED TERRITORIAL COMMUNITIES ON 29 October 2017 (19.10.2017 26.10.2017)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228223135/https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45055-interim-report-on-observation-results-of-the-first-local-elections-in-united-territorial-communities-on-29-october-2017-19102017-26102017 |date=28 December 2018 }}, [[PORA#OPORA|OPORA]] (31 October 2017)<br>[https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45165-ukraine-holds-elections-in-51-utcs-today Ukraine holds elections in 51 UTCs today] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226020921/https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45165-ukraine-holds-elections-in-51-utcs-today |date=2017-12-26 }}, [[PORA#OPORA|OPORA]] (24 December 2017)</ref> \n\nThe Law \"On Local Self-Government in Ukraine\" stipulates that local budgets should have enough money to be administered by local self-government bodies.<ref name=\"Espresogr\"/> Because many of the small rural councils and cities of district significance could never hope to do this the new administrative unit ''Amalgamated hromada'' ([https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B1%27%D1%94%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%96%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0]{{lang-uk|\u041e\u0431'\u0454\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0430}}, ''Obyednana terytorial\u02b9na hromada'') was created.<ref name=\"Espresogr\">{{in lang|uk}} [https://espreso.tv/article/2017/10/30/vybory_v_obyednanykh_terytorialnykh_gromadakh_scho_ce_i_dlya_chogo_potribne Elections in the united territorial communities.
