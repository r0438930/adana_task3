On one side, 14 Chechen and French African ISIL fighters, members of the elite Ingimassayeen units, still held the control room, the floodgates, and a number of tunnels inside Tabqa Dam. Even though they were left without light or fresh air, as the SDF had shut down all electricity to the dam, and without means to communicate with their allies because the coalition jammed their radio frequencies, these ISIL fighters had resisted attempts to clear them out for weeks. The second, bigger holdout was in northern Tabqa city, where around 50 ISIL militants still defended a number of highly fortified apartments. In course of 10 May, however, this last resistance was finally broken,<ref name=\"handful\" /> when the remaining ISIL defenders surrendered or fled. According to the [[United States Central Command]], the Islamists had acceded to SDF's demand of dismantling the [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] surrounding the dam. The anti-ISIL coalition stated that it tracked those militants who fled and targeted those who could be killed without harming civilians.<ref>{{cite

On one side, 14 Chechen and French African ISIL fighters, members of the elite Ingimassayeen units, still held the control room, the floodgates, and a number of tunnels inside Tabqa Dam. Even though they were left without light or fresh air, as the SDF had shut down all electricity to the dam, and without means to communicate with their allies because the coalition jammed their radio frequencies, these ISIL fighters had resisted attempts to clear them out for weeks. The second, bigger holdout was in northern Tabqa city, where around 50 ISIL militants still defended a number of highly fortified apartments. In course of 10 May, however, this last resistance was finally broken,<ref name=\"handful\" /> when the remaining ISIL defenders surrendered or fled. According to the [[United States Central Command]], the Islamists had acceded to SDF's demand of dismantling the [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] surrounding the dam.
