Areas of influence include diet, writing, industry, education, language, law, lifestyle, politics, philosophy, religion, science and technology, culture, and value systems. More broadly, \"Sinicization\" may refer to policies of [[acculturation]], [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], or [[cultural imperialism]] imposed by [[China]] onto neighboring [[East Asia|East Asian countries]], and [[Ethnic minorities in China|minority ethnic groups]] inside China.  Evidence of this can be seen in the value systems, cuisine, [[Chinese architecture|architectural style]], and lexicons. This is reflected in the histories of [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] for example, in the [[adoption of Chinese literary culture|adoption of the Chinese writing system]] as [[Written Chinese|the script]] of the Han Chinese has long been a unifying feature in the [[Sinosphere]] as the vehicle for exporting Chinese culture to these Asian countries.\n\n==Integration==\nThe integration or assimilation policy is a type of [[nationalism]] aimed at strengthening of the Chinese identity among the population. Proponents believe integration will help to develop shared values, pride in being the country\u2019s citizen, respect and acceptance towards cultural differences among citizens of China. Critics argue that integration destroys [[ethnic diversity]], [[language diversity]], and [[cultural diversity]]. Analogous to [[North America]] with approximately 300 [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] and distinct ethnic groups; in China there are 292 non-Mandarin [[Languages of China|languages]] spoken by native peoples of the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/CN|title=China|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Ethnologue]]|language=en|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref> There are also a number of [[Immigration to China|immigrant]] languages, such as [[Khmer language|Khmer]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[English language|English]], etc.\n\n==Historical examples of sinicization==\n===Austronesian peoples===\nBefore sinicization, non-Chinese indigenous peoples of [[South China|Southern China]], collectively termed by the Chinese as [[Baiyue]] inhabited the coastline of China from as far north as the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] to as far south as the [[Gulf of Tonkin]].  Analysis of DNA recovered from human remains shows high frequencies of [[Haplogroup O1]] in [[Liangzhu culture]] linking this culture to modern Austronesian populations. It is believed that Liangzhu culture was the ancestral homeland of Proto-Austronesian populations before they [[Austronesian hypothesis|spread to Taiwan]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. Over time, the southward spread of Han Chinese led to the sinicization of most of the Baiyue populations that remained in Southern China, whether in the [[Yangtze River valley|Yangtze Valley]] or in coastal areas from the mouth of the Yangtze to the [[Gulf of Tonkin]].<ref>{{cite book|title= Prehistoric Settlement of the Pacific, Volume 86, Part 5|url= https://books.google.com/?id=XiELAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA137&dq=in+the+southward+spread+of+Han+Chinese+led+to+the+sinicization+of+all+AN-speakers#v=onepage&q=in%20the%20southward%20spread%20of%20Han%20Chinese%20led%20to%20the%20sinicization%20of%20all%20AN-speakers&f=false|isbn = 9780871698650|last1 = Goodenough|first1 = Ward Hunt|year = 1996}}</ref> The remnants of these peoples who were not fully sinicized are now recognized officially as the [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]] of the [[China|PRC]].\n\n===Turkic peoples===\n{{main|Taoyuan County, Hunan#Taoyuan Uyghurs}}\n\nDescendants of [[Uyghurs]] who migrated to [[Taoyuan County, Hunan]] have largely assimilated into the Han Chinese and [[Hui people|Hui]] population and practice Chinese customs, speaking [[varieties of Chinese]] as their language.\n\n===Tang dynasty===\nDuring the 8th and 9th centuries in the [[Tang dynasty]], Chinese male soldiers moved into [[Guizhou]] ([[Chinese postal romanization|formerly romanized as]] Kweichow) and married native non-Chinese women, their descendants being known as ''Lao-han-jen'' (original Chinese), in contrast to new Chinese people who colonized Guizhou at later times.

Areas of influence include diet, writing, industry, education, language, law, lifestyle, politics, philosophy, religion, science and technology, culture, and value systems. More broadly, \"Sinicization\" may refer to policies of [[acculturation]], [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], or [[cultural imperialism]] imposed by [[China]] onto neighboring [[East Asia|East Asian countries]], and [[Ethnic minorities in China|minority ethnic groups]] inside China.  Evidence of this can be seen in the value systems, cuisine, [[Chinese architecture|architectural style]], and lexicons. This is reflected in the histories of [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] for example, in the [[adoption of Chinese literary culture|adoption of the Chinese writing system]] as [[Written Chinese|the script]] of the Han Chinese has long been a unifying feature in the [[Sinosphere]] as the vehicle for exporting Chinese culture to these Asian countries.\n\n==Integration==\nThe integration or assimilation policy is a type of [[nationalism]] aimed at strengthening of the Chinese identity among the population.
