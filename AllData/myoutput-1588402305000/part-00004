It is derived from the [[free software]] [[Chromium OS]] and uses the [[Google Chrome]] web browser as its principal [[user interface]].\n\nGoogle announced the project in July 2009, conceiving it as an operating system in which both applications and user data reside in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]]: hence Chrome OS primarily runs [[web application]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/chromium-os-kernel|title = Kernel Design|date = |accessdate = |website = The Chromium Projects|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Source code and a public demo came that November. The first Chrome OS [[laptop]], known as a [[Chromebook]], arrived in May 2011. Initial Chromebook shipments from [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] and [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] occurred in July 2011.\n\nChrome OS has an integrated media player and [[file manager]]. It supports [[Google Chrome App|Chrome Apps]], which resemble native applications, as well as [[Remote computer|remote access]] to the desktop. Reception was initially skeptical, with some observers arguing that a browser running on any operating system was functionally equivalent. As more Chrome OS machines have entered the market, the operating system is now seldom evaluated apart from the hardware that runs it.\n\n[[Android (operating system)|Android]] applications started to become available for the operating system in 2014, and in 2016, access to Android apps in [[Google Play]]'s entirety was introduced on supported Chrome OS devices. Support for a Linux terminal and applications, known as Project Crostini<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/containers_and_vms.md|title=Chromium OS Docs - Running Custom Containers Under Chrome OS|website=chromium.googlesource.com}}</ref>, was released to the stable channel in Chrome OS 69. This was made possible via a lightweight Linux kernel that runs containers inside a [[virtual machine]].\n\nChrome OS is only available pre-installed on hardware from Google manufacturing partners, but there are unofficial methods that allow it to be installed in other equipment.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Chrome OS unofficial forks| url = https://quickfever.com/chrome-os-for-pc/|website = quickfever.com|access-date = 2018-12-20}}</ref> Its [[Open-source software|open-source]] upstream, [[Chromium OS]], can be [[compiled]] from downloaded [[source code]]. Early on, Google provided design goals for Chrome OS, but has not otherwise released a technical description.\n\n== History ==\nGoogle announced Chrome OS on July 7, 2009,<ref name=\"Chrome OS official ann\"/> describing it as an operating system in which both applications and user data reside in the [[cloud computing|cloud]]. To ascertain marketing requirements, the company relied on informal metrics, including monitoring the usage patterns of some 200 Chrome OS machines used by Google employees. Developers also noted their own usage patterns.

In so doing, they also released the first [[Chromebox]], the Samsung Series 3, which was Chrome OS's entrance into the world of desktop computers.<ref name=Samsung55OAnnouncementBBC>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18253961|title=Google Chrome OS computers updated with faster processors|date=2012-05-29|author=Leo Kelion}}</ref> Although they were faster than the previous range of devices, they were still underpowered compared to other desktops and laptops of the time, fitting in more closely with the [[Netbook]] market. Only months later, in October, Samsung and Google released a new Chromebook at a significantly lower price point ($250, compared to the previous Series 5 Chromebooks' $450).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/10/google-debuts-a-new-250-chromebook/|title=Google Debuts $250 Chromebook|date=2012-10-18|author=Nathan Olivarez-Giles|work=Wired}}</ref> It was the first Chromebook to use an [[ARM processor]], one from Samsung's [[Exynos]] line. In order to reduce the price, Google and Samsung also reduced the memory and screen resolution of the device. An advantage of using the ARM processor, however, was that the Chromebook didn't require a fan. Acer followed quickly after with the C7 Chromebook, priced even lower ($199), but containing an Intel [[Celeron]] processor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/11/26/acer-c7-chromebook-review/|title=Acer C7 Chromebook review: Chrome OS on the cheap, but at what cost?|date=2012-11-26|author=Myriam Joire}}</ref> One notable way Acer reduced the cost of the C7 was to use a laptop [[hard disk]] rather than a [[solid-state drive]].\n\nIn April 2012, Google made the first update to Chrome OS's user interface since the operating system had launched, introducing a hardware-accelerated window manager called \"Aura\" along with a conventional taskbar. The additions marked a departure from the operating system's original concept of a single browser with tabs and gave Chrome OS the look and feel of a more conventional desktop operating system. \"In a way, this almost feels as if Google is admitting defeat here\", wrote Frederic Lardinois on TechCrunch. He argued that Google had traded its original version of simplicity for greater functionality. \"That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, though, and may just help Chrome OS gain more mainstream acceptance as new users will surely find it to be a more familiar experience.\"<ref name=\"TechCrunch: new UI\">{{cite news|last=Lardinois|first=Frederic|title=Google's Chrome OS Will Soon Look More Like Windows Than A Browser|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/googles-chrome-os-will-soon-look-more-like-windows-than-a-browser/|accessdate=June 2, 2013|newspaper=Techcrunch|date=April 9, 2012}}</ref> [[Lenovo]] and [[HP Inc.|HP]] followed Samsung and Acer in manufacturing Chromebooks in early 2013 with their own models.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/4/3946570/hp-pavilion-14-chromebook-officially-on-sale-today|title=HP's first Chromebook arrives, offers a large screen and a small battery for $329.99|date=2013-02-04|author=Sean Hollister}}</ref> Lenovo specifically targeted their Chromebook at students, headlining their press release with \"Lenovo Introduces Rugged ThinkPad Chromebook for Schools\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.lenovo.com/news+releases/lenovo-introduces-rugged-thinkpad-chromebook-for-schools.htm|title=Lenovo Introduces Rugged ThinkPad Chromebook for Schools|date=2013-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205145221/http://news.lenovo.com/news+releases/lenovo-introduces-rugged-thinkpad-chromebook-for-schools.htm|archive-date=2013-02-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-unveils-the-sturdy-ThinkPad-X131e-Chromebook-for-students.87535.0.html|title=Lenovo unveils the sturdy ThinkPad X131e Chromebook for students|date=2013-01-18|author=Ivan Zhekov}}</ref>\n\nWhen Google released [[Google Drive]], they also included Drive integration in the next version of Chrome OS (version 20), released in July 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2012/07/stable-channel-updates-for-chromebooks.html|title=Stable Channel Updates for Chromebooks|date=2012-07-11}}</ref> While Chrome OS had supported Flash since 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/03/google-flash-chrome-browser/|title=Google fires at Apple, Integrates Flash into Chrome Browser|date=2010-03-31|author=Priya Ganapati|work=Wired}}</ref> by the end of 2012 it had been fully [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandboxed]], preventing issues with Flash from affecting other parts of Chrome OS.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/google/2012/11/13/google-declares-flash-is-now-fully-sandboxed-in-chrome-for-windows-mac-linux-and-chrome-os/|title=Google declares Flash is now 'fully sandboxed' in Chrome for Windows, Mac, Linux and Chrome OS|date=2012-11-13|author=Emil Protalinski|work=TheNextWeb}}</ref> This affected all versions of Chrome including Chrome OS.\n\n=== Chromebook Pixel ===\n\n[[File:Chromebook Pixel (WiFi) open.JPG|thumb|Chromebook Pixel (Wi-Fi) open]]\n{{Main|Chromebook Pixel}}\nUp to this point, Google had never made their own Chrome OS device.

Drewry described Chrome OS as a \"hardened\" operating system featuring auto-updating and [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] features that would reduce malware exposure. He said that Chrome OS netbooks would be shipped with [[Trusted Platform Module]] (TPM), and include both a \"trusted bootpath\" and a physical switch under the battery compartment that actuates a developer mode. That mode drops some specialized security functions but increases developer flexibility. Drewry also emphasized that the open-source nature of the operating system would contribute greatly to its security by allowing constant developer feedback.<ref name=\"Messmer06Mar10\">{{cite web|url = http://www.itworld.com/security/99227/google-sheds-light-chrome-os-netbook-security?source=smlynch|title = Google sheds light on Chrome OS Netbook security|accessdate =March 8, 2010|last = Messmer|first = Ellen|date=March 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt a December 2010 press conference, Google claimed that Chrome OS would be the most secure consumer operating system due in part to a [[verified boot]] ability, in which the initial boot code, stored in read-only memory, checks for system compromises.<ref name=\"Paul08Dec10\">{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/guides/2010/12/google-demos-chrome-os-launches-pilot-program.ars|title=Google demos Chrome OS, launches pilot program|accessdate=December 8, 2010|last = Paul|first = Ryan|date=December 2010| work=[[Ars Technica]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Shell access ===\nChrome OS includes the Chrome Shell, or \"crosh\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform2/+/HEAD/crosh|title=crosh - chromiumos/platform2 - Git at Google|website=chromium.googlesource.com}}</ref> which documents minimal functionality such as ping and [[Secure Shell|SSH]] at crosh start-up.\n\nIn developer mode, a full-featured [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices/samsung-series-5-chromebook |title=Samsung Series 5 Chromebook |work=The Chromium Projects |quote=sudo bash |accessdate=June 5, 2015}}</ref> shell (which is supposed to be used for development purposes<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/shell-style-guidelines |title=Shell Style Guidelines |work=The Chromium Projects |quote=When writing code that is used on developer systems or dev/test Chromium OS images, always use bash.

Designers considered a reduced window management scheme that would operate only in full-screen mode. Secondary tasks would be handled with \"panels\": floating windows that dock to the bottom of the screen for tasks like chat and music players. Split screens were also under consideration for viewing two pieces of content side-by-side. Chrome OS would follow the Chrome browser's practice of leveraging [[HTML5]]'s offline modes, background processing, and notifications. Designers proposed using search and pinned tabs as a way to quickly locate and access applications.<ref name=\"UX\">{{cite web|url=https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/user-experience|title=The Chromium Projects: User Experience|accessdate=November 21, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==== Version 19 window manager and graphics engine ====\n\nOn April 10, 2012, a new build of Chrome OS offered a choice between the original full-screen window interface and overlapping, re-sizable windows, such as found on [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[macOS]].<ref name=cnet2012 /> The feature was implemented through the Ash window manager, which runs atop the Aura hardware-accelerated graphics engine. The April 2012 upgrade also included the ability to display smaller, overlapping browser windows, each with its own translucent tabs, browser tabs that can be \"torn\" and dragged to new positions or merged with another tab strip, and a mouse-enabled shortcut list across the bottom of the screen. One icon on the task bar shows a list of installed applications and bookmarks. Writing in CNET, Stephen Shankland argued that with overlapping windows, \"Google is anchoring itself into the past\" as both [[iOS]] and Microsoft's [[Metro (design language)|Metro]] interface are largely or entirely full-screen. Even so, \"Chrome OS already is different enough that it's best to preserve any familiarity that can be preserved\".<ref name=cnet2012>{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-57411748-2/google-gives-chrome-os-a-less-alienating-interface/|title = Google gives Chrome OS a less alienating interface|date = April 10, 2012<!-- 6:33{{nbsp}}am PDT-->|author = Stephen Shankland|publisher = CNET}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/04/google-chrome-microsoft-apple/|title = Google Chrome OS Busts Out Of Browser With New Interface|author = Caleb Garling|date = April 10, 2012|publisher = Wired}}</ref><ref name=\"Paul16Apr12\">{{cite news|url = https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/reviews/2012/04/hands-on-getting-work-done-with-googles-new-aura-interface-for-chrome-os.ars|title = Hands-on: getting work done with Google's new Aura interface for Chrome OS|accessdate =April 17, 2012|last = Paul|first = Ryan|date = April 16, 2012| work = [[Ars Technica]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Printing ===\n[[Google Cloud Print]] is a Google service that helps any application on any device to print on supported printers.

Both Chrome&nbsp;OS and the Chrome browser may introduce difficulties to end users when handling specific file types offline; for example, when opening an image or document residing on a local storage device, it may be unclear whether and which specific Web application should be automatically opened for viewing, or the handling should be performed by a traditional application acting as a preview utility. Matthew Papakipos, Chrome&nbsp;OS engineering director, noted in 2010 that Windows developers have faced the same fundamental problem: \"Quicktime is fighting with Windows Media Player, which is fighting with Chrome.\"<ref name=\"Ars Technica: Google Talks\" />\n\n=== Release channels and updates ===\nChrome OS uses the same release system as Google Chrome: there are three distinct channels: Stable, Beta, and Developer preview (called the \"Dev\" channel). The stable channel is updated with features and fixes that have been thoroughly tested in the Beta channel, and the Beta channel is updated approximately once a month with stable and complete features from the Developer channel.

It is derived from the [[free software]] [[Chromium OS]] and uses the [[Google Chrome]] web browser as its principal [[user interface]].\n\nGoogle announced the project in July 2009, conceiving it as an operating system in which both applications and user data reside in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]]: hence Chrome OS primarily runs [[web application]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/chromium-os-kernel|title = Kernel Design|date = |accessdate = |website = The Chromium Projects|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Source code and a public demo came that November. The first Chrome OS [[laptop]], known as a [[Chromebook]], arrived in May 2011. Initial Chromebook shipments from [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] and [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] occurred in July 2011.\n\nChrome OS has an integrated media player and [[file manager]]. It supports [[Google Chrome App|Chrome Apps]], which resemble native applications, as well as [[Remote computer|remote access]] to the desktop. Reception was initially skeptical, with some observers arguing that a browser running on any operating system was functionally equivalent. As more Chrome OS machines have entered the market, the operating system is now seldom evaluated apart from the hardware that runs it.\n\n[[Android (operating system)|Android]] applications started to become available for the operating system in 2014, and in 2016, access to Android apps in [[Google Play]]'s entirety was introduced on supported Chrome OS devices. Support for a Linux terminal and applications, known as Project Crostini<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/containers_and_vms.md|title=Chromium OS Docs - Running Custom Containers Under Chrome OS|website=chromium.googlesource.com}}</ref>, was released to the stable channel in Chrome OS 69. This was made possible via a lightweight Linux kernel that runs containers inside a [[virtual machine]].\n\nChrome OS is only available pre-installed on hardware from Google manufacturing partners, but there are unofficial methods that allow it to be installed in other equipment.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Chrome OS unofficial forks| url = https://quickfever.com/chrome-os-for-pc/|website = quickfever.com|access-date = 2018-12-20}}</ref> Its [[Open-source software|open-source]] upstream, [[Chromium OS]], can be [[compiled]] from downloaded [[source code]]. Early on, Google provided design goals for Chrome OS, but has not otherwise released a technical description.\n\n== History ==\nGoogle announced Chrome OS on July 7, 2009,<ref name=\"Chrome OS official ann\"/> describing it as an operating system in which both applications and user data reside in the [[cloud computing|cloud]]. To ascertain marketing requirements, the company relied on informal metrics, including monitoring the usage patterns of some 200 Chrome OS machines used by Google employees. Developers also noted their own usage patterns.

Only months later, in October, Samsung and Google released a new Chromebook at a significantly lower price point ($250, compared to the previous Series 5 Chromebooks' $450).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/10/google-debuts-a-new-250-chromebook/|title=Google Debuts $250 Chromebook|date=2012-10-18|author=Nathan Olivarez-Giles|work=Wired}}</ref> It was the first Chromebook to use an [[ARM processor]], one from Samsung's [[Exynos]] line. In order to reduce the price, Google and Samsung also reduced the memory and screen resolution of the device. An advantage of using the ARM processor, however, was that the Chromebook didn't require a fan. Acer followed quickly after with the C7 Chromebook, priced even lower ($199), but containing an Intel [[Celeron]] processor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/11/26/acer-c7-chromebook-review/|title=Acer C7 Chromebook review: Chrome OS on the cheap, but at what cost?|date=2012-11-26|author=Myriam Joire}}</ref> One notable way Acer reduced the cost of the C7 was to use a laptop [[hard disk]] rather than a [[solid-state drive]].\n\nIn April 2012, Google made the first update to Chrome OS's user interface since the operating system had launched, introducing a hardware-accelerated window manager called \"Aura\" along with a conventional taskbar. The additions marked a departure from the operating system's original concept of a single browser with tabs and gave Chrome OS the look and feel of a more conventional desktop operating system. \"In a way, this almost feels as if Google is admitting defeat here\", wrote Frederic Lardinois on TechCrunch.

Drewry described Chrome OS as a \"hardened\" operating system featuring auto-updating and [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] features that would reduce malware exposure. He said that Chrome OS netbooks would be shipped with [[Trusted Platform Module]] (TPM), and include both a \"trusted bootpath\" and a physical switch under the battery compartment that actuates a developer mode. That mode drops some specialized security functions but increases developer flexibility. Drewry also emphasized that the open-source nature of the operating system would contribute greatly to its security by allowing constant developer feedback.<ref name=\"Messmer06Mar10\">{{cite web|url = http://www.itworld.com/security/99227/google-sheds-light-chrome-os-netbook-security?source=smlynch|title = Google sheds light on Chrome OS Netbook security|accessdate =March 8, 2010|last = Messmer|first = Ellen|date=March 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt a December 2010 press conference, Google claimed that Chrome OS would be the most secure consumer operating system due in part to a [[verified boot]] ability, in which the initial boot code, stored in read-only memory, checks for system compromises.<ref name=\"Paul08Dec10\">{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/guides/2010/12/google-demos-chrome-os-launches-pilot-program.ars|title=Google demos Chrome OS, launches pilot program|accessdate=December 8, 2010|last = Paul|first = Ryan|date=December 2010| work=[[Ars Technica]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Shell access ===\nChrome OS includes the Chrome Shell, or \"crosh\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform2/+/HEAD/crosh|title=crosh - chromiumos/platform2 - Git at Google|website=chromium.googlesource.com}}</ref> which documents minimal functionality such as ping and [[Secure Shell|SSH]] at crosh start-up.\n\nIn developer mode, a full-featured [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices/samsung-series-5-chromebook |title=Samsung Series 5 Chromebook |work=The Chromium Projects |quote=sudo bash |accessdate=June 5, 2015}}</ref> shell (which is supposed to be used for development purposes<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/shell-style-guidelines |title=Shell Style Guidelines |work=The Chromium Projects |quote=When writing code that is used on developer systems or dev/test Chromium OS images, always use bash.

Designers considered a reduced window management scheme that would operate only in full-screen mode. Secondary tasks would be handled with \"panels\": floating windows that dock to the bottom of the screen for tasks like chat and music players. Split screens were also under consideration for viewing two pieces of content side-by-side. Chrome OS would follow the Chrome browser's practice of leveraging [[HTML5]]'s offline modes, background processing, and notifications. Designers proposed using search and pinned tabs as a way to quickly locate and access applications.<ref name=\"UX\">{{cite web|url=https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/user-experience|title=The Chromium Projects: User Experience|accessdate=November 21, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==== Version 19 window manager and graphics engine ====\n\nOn April 10, 2012, a new build of Chrome OS offered a choice between the original full-screen window interface and overlapping, re-sizable windows, such as found on [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[macOS]].<ref name=cnet2012 /> The feature was implemented through the Ash window manager, which runs atop the Aura hardware-accelerated graphics engine. The April 2012 upgrade also included the ability to display smaller, overlapping browser windows, each with its own translucent tabs, browser tabs that can be \"torn\" and dragged to new positions or merged with another tab strip, and a mouse-enabled shortcut list across the bottom of the screen. One icon on the task bar shows a list of installed applications and bookmarks. Writing in CNET, Stephen Shankland argued that with overlapping windows, \"Google is anchoring itself into the past\" as both [[iOS]] and Microsoft's [[Metro (design language)|Metro]] interface are largely or entirely full-screen. Even so, \"Chrome OS already is different enough that it's best to preserve any familiarity that can be preserved\".<ref name=cnet2012>{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-57411748-2/google-gives-chrome-os-a-less-alienating-interface/|title = Google gives Chrome OS a less alienating interface|date = April 10, 2012<!-- 6:33{{nbsp}}am PDT-->|author = Stephen Shankland|publisher = CNET}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/04/google-chrome-microsoft-apple/|title = Google Chrome OS Busts Out Of Browser With New Interface|author = Caleb Garling|date = April 10, 2012|publisher = Wired}}</ref><ref name=\"Paul16Apr12\">{{cite news|url = https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/reviews/2012/04/hands-on-getting-work-done-with-googles-new-aura-interface-for-chrome-os.ars|title = Hands-on: getting work done with Google's new Aura interface for Chrome OS|accessdate =April 17, 2012|last = Paul|first = Ryan|date = April 16, 2012| work = [[Ars Technica]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Printing ===\n[[Google Cloud Print]] is a Google service that helps any application on any device to print on supported printers.

Both Chrome&nbsp;OS and the Chrome browser may introduce difficulties to end users when handling specific file types offline; for example, when opening an image or document residing on a local storage device, it may be unclear whether and which specific Web application should be automatically opened for viewing, or the handling should be performed by a traditional application acting as a preview utility. Matthew Papakipos, Chrome&nbsp;OS engineering director, noted in 2010 that Windows developers have faced the same fundamental problem: \"Quicktime is fighting with Windows Media Player, which is fighting with Chrome.\"<ref name=\"Ars Technica: Google Talks\" />\n\n=== Release channels and updates ===\nChrome OS uses the same release system as Google Chrome: there are three distinct channels: Stable, Beta, and Developer preview (called the \"Dev\" channel). The stable channel is updated with features and fixes that have been thoroughly tested in the Beta channel, and the Beta channel is updated approximately once a month with stable and complete features from the Developer channel.
