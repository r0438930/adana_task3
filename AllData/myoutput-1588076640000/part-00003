After the completion of the chassis modification, it received the index \"Object 952\". The turret was developed in Yekaterinburg artillery plant number 9.<ref name=2s25 /> In mid-2001, it was stated that the Volgograd tractor plant had been working on the 2S25 for about seven years. Recent information has indicated that production of the BMD-4 airborne combat vehicle has been transferred to the Kurgan Machine Construction Plant, where production of the [[BMP-3]] armored fighting vehicle and its variants are currently undertaken for the local and export markets. As far as it is known, production of the 2S25 self-propelled anti-tank gun is still being carried out at the Volgograd tractor plant. One of its first trials took place on May 8, 2001 on the \"Prudboy\" tank firing range located North Caucasian military district for the representatives of the power ministries of Russia and foreign military and diplomatic corps from 14 other countries of Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America.<ref name=xpo />\n\nAccording to Russian information, the Russian Army placed an initial contract for 15 2S25 SPATG in three batches of five vehicles each in 2005. This was followed by a second batch of 45 units with the total requirement being for up to 85\u2013110 units.<ref name=armc /> However, there were only four batteries (24 vehicles) in service with the airborne forces as of 2009.<ref name=vdvser>{{cite web|title=VDV plan to get new 200 BMD-4M combat vehicles in the coming years (In Russia)|url=http://armstass.su/?page=article&aid=78811&cid=25|publisher=ARMS TASS}}</ref> In 2010, the cancellation of further procurement was announced as well as the termination of release due to a fire caused by a fuel leakage on one of the vehicles after a military parade on [[Red Square]].<ref name=fyre>{{cite web|title=Russian army airborne troops ordered new 125mm self-propelled gun to replace 2S25 Sprut-SD|url=http://www.armyrecognition.com/may_2013_news_defence_army_military_industry_uk/russian_army_airborne_troops_ordered_new_125mm_self-propelled_gun_to_replace_2s25_sprut-sd_2605133.html|publisher=Army Recognition}}</ref> The cancellation of further purchases was later denied by VDV commander Vladimir Shamarov in an interview with RIA Novosti military commentator Ilya Kramnik.<ref name=ria>{{cite web|title=Shamanov: Russian Airborne Troops ready to tackle combat missions (In Russian)|url=http://ria.ru/interview/20100802/260908344.html|publisher=RIA News}}</ref>\nSerial production starts 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|title = \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u00ab\u0421\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0442-\u0421\u0414\u041c-1\u00bb \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043d \u0432 2018 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 - \u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u00ab\u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430\u00bb|url = http://tvzvezda.ru/news/forces/content/201602101343-42cl.htm|website = tvzvezda.ru|access-date = 2016-02-11}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n{{see also|BMD-3}}\nThe 2S25 is based on the chassis of the BMD-3 [[Infantry fighting vehicle]], which is also produced by the Volgograd tractor factory and is in service with the Russian airborne troops. Notable distinctions from the BMD-3 are the armament, the fire control system and the addition of two wheels to each side of the vehicle; which increases the number to seven on each side.<ref name=armc /> The crew is located at the front of the chassis. The turret and ammunition occupies the middle of the vehicle, while the engine-transmission compartment is towards the rear. The driver has a hatch on the front deck; the commander and gunner have hatches on the turret deck. In the stowed position, the commander sits to the right of the driver, while the gunner sits to the left.<ref name=sec2>{{cite web|title=2S25 Sprut-SD Self-Propelled Anti-tank Gun|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/2s25.htm|publisher=Global Security}}</ref> Each crew member has available built-in roof observant instruments with the day and night channels.<ref name=sec2 /> Standard equipment includes an electronic [[NBC protection]] system to ensure survivability of the crew in case of [[nuclear fallout]].<ref name=xpo />\n\n===Armament===\n[[File:Tank turret, Volgograd region.jpeg|thumb|left|The main armament of the 2S25 is capable of firing the same ammunition used by the [[T-72]], the [[T-80]] and the [[T-90]].<ref name=sec />]]\n{{further|Sprut anti-tank gun}}\nThe 2S25 Sprut-SD is equipped with a two-man turret armed with a 125&nbsp;mm anti-tank gun. The gun is fitted with an autoloader, which ensures the high rate of fire of 6\u22128 rounds per minute with both conventional projectiles and rounds with guided missiles.<ref name=tplant /> It is completely stabilized in the vertical and horizontal planes and conducts fire with the same 125&nbsp;mm separate case ammunition loadings that are used for the [[2A46]] smoothbore tank gun. With the fire control system featuring this stabilization of the elevation and azimuth, it also includes a laser rangefinder and a ballistic computer that provides ever-changing data about the target. The two-plane stabilization of the commander's sight is aligned with the laser sight for aiming the 125&nbsp;mm shells onto the laser rangefinder.<ref name=armc /><ref name=xpo />\n\nThe main armament of the 2S25 is a 125&nbsp;mm smoothbore 2A75 tank gun, which is a derivative of the 125&nbsp;mm 2A46 tank gun installed on Russian main battle tanks.<ref name=sprutgun>{{cite web|title=Special Design Bureau No 9 (In Russian) |url=http://www.zavod9.com/?pid=10093 |publisher=Zavod No 9 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69WS0Lh5x?url=http://www.zavod9.com/?pid=10093 |archivedate=2012-07-29 }}</ref> The angles of elevation and depression for the anti-tank gun are +15\u00b0 and \u22125\u00b0 respectively.

The 2A75's ammunition includes laser guided missiles like the [[9M119 Svir]], which have a maximum range of 4&nbsp;km, for defeating armored targets. Reloading the main gun is completed by means of a horizontal autoloader mounted behind the turret. It can carry 40 rounds for the main armament, with 22 ready to use in the autoloader. In case the autoloader is no longer intact, manual loading is possible at the cost of a substantially longer reload time.<ref name=sec2 /> A coaxial 7.62&nbsp;mm [[PKT machine gun|PKT]] machine gun mounted to the left side of the main armament serves as the secondary armament of the 2S25; equipped with one tape of 2000 rounds.<ref name=sec>{{cite web|title=2S25 Sprut-SD Self-Propelled Anti-tank Gun Specifications|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/2s25-specs.htm|publisher=Global Security}}</ref>\n\n===Mobility===\n{{see also|Hydropneumatic suspension}}\n[[File:Russia Arms Expo 2013 (531-28).jpg|thumb|As of September 2013, the only operators of the 2S25 are the [[Russian Airborne Troops|Russian airborne troops]].]]\nThe weight of the 2S25 is 18 tonnes, which is comparable to that of infantry fighting vehicles. Like the BMD-3, the 2S25 features hydropneumatic suspension with a variable height clearance of 190\u2013590&nbsp;mm, which can be altered within 6\u20137 seconds to reduce visibility.<ref name=2s25 /> Hydropneumatic suspension provides high smoothness while driving and dampens recoil of the main gun. Suspension on each side consists of seven single rollers, four support rollers, rear wheel drive and a front-mounted steering wheel. There are hydraulic track adjusters in assistance for greater mobility. In the engine-transmission compartment, multi-fuel diesel engine 2V-06-2S installed, which develops a power of 510&nbsp;hp (380&nbsp;kW). It features an automatic transmission that has five gears forward and five gears reverse.<ref name=2s25 />\n\nWhile driving, the 2S25 can reach a top speed of {{convert|71|km/h|mph}} on an even road; the average speed being 45\u221250&nbsp;km/h (28-31 mph) when driving off-road. The vehicle exerts a ground pressure of 0.36 to 0.53&nbsp;kg/cm\u00b2 depending on the type of tracks.<ref name=2s25 /> It can overcome vertical obstacles as tall as {{convert|0.8|m|ft}} and cross {{convert|2.8|m|ft}} trenches. Like many other Russian armored fighting vehicles, the Sprut-SD is completely amphibious and moves with the help of two water jets that allow it to reach a speed of 8\u201310&nbsp;km/h depending on the state of the currents. To increase the buoyancy, wheels are equipped with airtight chambers and powerful water pumps; extracting water from the lower chassis. The vehicle is sea worthy and can cross water obstacles without preparation in a [[sea state]] of up to 3. While waterborne, the 2S25 retains the capability of firing the gun within a \u00b135\u00b0 sector towards the front of the chassis.<ref name=xpo />\n\n===Protection===\n\nThe hull of the 2S25 self-propelled anti-tank gun is composed of welded aluminum armor with a composite skin to maintain a light weight.<ref name=armc /> Through the frontal arc, 40\u00b0 left and right of the frontal armor provides protection against attack from 23&nbsp;mm weapons at 500 m (550 [[Yard|yd]]) and against small arms fire and shell splinters through the remainder of the vehicle.<ref name=2s25>{{cite web|title=2S25 Sprut-SD (In Russian)|url=http://btvt.narod.ru/3/2c25sprut.htm}}</ref> Two banks of three smoke-grenade dischargers are mounted towards the rear on each side of the turret as countermeasures to infrared weapons.<ref name=armc>{{cite web|title=2S25 Sprut-SD Self-propelled anti-tank gun|url=http://www.armyrecognition.com/russia_russian_army_light_armoured_vehicle_uk/2s25_sprut-sd_self-propelled_anti-tank_gun_technical_data_sheet_specifications_description_uk.html|publisher=Army Recognition}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n* [[Sprut-SDM1]]: New version with [[fire-control system]] and [[remote weapon station]].<ref>https://thewarmy.com/a/desantniki_poluchat_shest_obnovlennyh_pushek_sprut_v_2017_godu-4897/</ref>\n\n==Employment==\n\nPossessing a high power-to-weight ratio of 28.3&nbsp;hp/tonne, the 2S25 can operate in high altitudes of up to 4000 m, while the installed rubber-clad shoes or snow-riding tracks expand the vehicle's capabilities in various climates.<ref name=tplant /> According to the manufacturer, the 2S25 can also be employed as a light amphibious tank by rapid deployment forces, airborne, marine and special purpose units. With its low weight, it can become essential in mountains and swamps regions, where heavy equipment cannot travel. The 2S25 is designed to be parachuted from aircraft such as the [[Il-76]] with the crew inside, allowing nearly immediate combat readiness upon landing to provide high firepower alongside paratroopers.<ref name=2s25 />\n\nThe tank destroyer Sprut-SD is tasked specifically with seeking out and destroying enemy tanks and armoured fighting vehicles, whether from an entrenched position or actively hunting.

After the completion of the chassis modification, it received the index \"Object 952\". The turret was developed in Yekaterinburg artillery plant number 9.<ref name=2s25 /> In mid-2001, it was stated that the Volgograd tractor plant had been working on the 2S25 for about seven years. Recent information has indicated that production of the BMD-4 airborne combat vehicle has been transferred to the Kurgan Machine Construction Plant, where production of the [[BMP-3]] armored fighting vehicle and its variants are currently undertaken for the local and export markets. As far as it is known, production of the 2S25 self-propelled anti-tank gun is still being carried out at the Volgograd tractor plant. One of its first trials took place on May 8, 2001 on the \"Prudboy\" tank firing range located North Caucasian military district for the representatives of the power ministries of Russia and foreign military and diplomatic corps from 14 other countries of Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America.<ref name=xpo />\n\nAccording to Russian information, the Russian Army placed an initial contract for 15 2S25 SPATG in three batches of five vehicles each in 2005.

The gun is fitted with an autoloader, which ensures the high rate of fire of 6\u22128 rounds per minute with both conventional projectiles and rounds with guided missiles.<ref name=tplant /> It is completely stabilized in the vertical and horizontal planes and conducts fire with the same 125&nbsp;mm separate case ammunition loadings that are used for the [[2A46]] smoothbore tank gun. With the fire control system featuring this stabilization of the elevation and azimuth, it also includes a laser rangefinder and a ballistic computer that provides ever-changing data about the target. The two-plane stabilization of the commander's sight is aligned with the laser sight for aiming the 125&nbsp;mm shells onto the laser rangefinder.<ref name=armc /><ref name=xpo />\n\nThe main armament of the 2S25 is a 125&nbsp;mm smoothbore 2A75 tank gun, which is a derivative of the 125&nbsp;mm 2A46 tank gun installed on Russian main battle tanks.<ref name=sprutgun>{{cite web|title=Special Design Bureau No 9 (In Russian) |url=http://www.zavod9.com/?pid=10093 |publisher=Zavod No 9 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69WS0Lh5x?url=http://www.zavod9.com/?pid=10093 |archivedate=2012-07-29 }}</ref> The angles of elevation and depression for the anti-tank gun are +15\u00b0 and \u22125\u00b0 respectively.

Reloading the main gun is completed by means of a horizontal autoloader mounted behind the turret. It can carry 40 rounds for the main armament, with 22 ready to use in the autoloader. In case the autoloader is no longer intact, manual loading is possible at the cost of a substantially longer reload time.<ref name=sec2 /> A coaxial 7.62&nbsp;mm [[PKT machine gun|PKT]] machine gun mounted to the left side of the main armament serves as the secondary armament of the 2S25; equipped with one tape of 2000 rounds.<ref name=sec>{{cite web|title=2S25 Sprut-SD Self-Propelled Anti-tank Gun Specifications|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/2s25-specs.htm|publisher=Global Security}}</ref>\n\n===Mobility===\n{{see also|Hydropneumatic suspension}}\n[[File:Russia Arms Expo 2013 (531-28).jpg|thumb|As of September 2013, the only operators of the 2S25 are the [[Russian Airborne Troops|Russian airborne troops]].]]\nThe weight of the 2S25 is 18 tonnes, which is comparable to that of infantry fighting vehicles. Like the BMD-3, the 2S25 features hydropneumatic suspension with a variable height clearance of 190\u2013590&nbsp;mm, which can be altered within 6\u20137 seconds to reduce visibility.<ref name=2s25 /> Hydropneumatic suspension provides high smoothness while driving and dampens recoil of the main gun. Suspension on each side consists of seven single rollers, four support rollers, rear wheel drive and a front-mounted steering wheel. There are hydraulic track adjusters in assistance for greater mobility. In the engine-transmission compartment, multi-fuel diesel engine 2V-06-2S installed, which develops a power of 510&nbsp;hp (380&nbsp;kW). It features an automatic transmission that has five gears forward and five gears reverse.<ref name=2s25 />\n\nWhile driving, the 2S25 can reach a top speed of {{convert|71|km/h|mph}} on an even road; the average speed being 45\u221250&nbsp;km/h (28-31 mph) when driving off-road. The vehicle exerts a ground pressure of 0.36 to 0.53&nbsp;kg/cm\u00b2 depending on the type of tracks.<ref name=2s25 /> It can overcome vertical obstacles as tall as {{convert|0.8|m|ft}} and cross {{convert|2.8|m|ft}} trenches. Like many other Russian armored fighting vehicles, the Sprut-SD is completely amphibious and moves with the help of two water jets that allow it to reach a speed of 8\u201310&nbsp;km/h depending on the state of the currents. To increase the buoyancy, wheels are equipped with airtight chambers and powerful water pumps; extracting water from the lower chassis. The vehicle is sea worthy and can cross water obstacles without preparation in a [[sea state]] of up to 3. While waterborne, the 2S25 retains the capability of firing the gun within a \u00b135\u00b0 sector towards the front of the chassis.<ref name=xpo />\n\n===Protection===\n\nThe hull of the 2S25 self-propelled anti-tank gun is composed of welded aluminum armor with a composite skin to maintain a light weight.<ref name=armc /> Through the frontal arc, 40\u00b0 left and right of the frontal armor provides protection against attack from 23&nbsp;mm weapons at 500 m (550 [[Yard|yd]]) and against small arms fire and shell splinters through the remainder of the vehicle.<ref name=2s25>{{cite web|title=2S25 Sprut-SD (In Russian)|url=http://btvt.narod.ru/3/2c25sprut.htm}}</ref> Two banks of three smoke-grenade dischargers are mounted towards the rear on each side of the turret as countermeasures to infrared weapons.<ref name=armc>{{cite web|title=2S25 Sprut-SD Self-propelled anti-tank gun|url=http://www.armyrecognition.com/russia_russian_army_light_armoured_vehicle_uk/2s25_sprut-sd_self-propelled_anti-tank_gun_technical_data_sheet_specifications_description_uk.html|publisher=Army Recognition}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n* [[Sprut-SDM1]]: New version with [[fire-control system]] and [[remote weapon station]].<ref>https://thewarmy.com/a/desantniki_poluchat_shest_obnovlennyh_pushek_sprut_v_2017_godu-4897/</ref>\n\n==Employment==\n\nPossessing a high power-to-weight ratio of 28.3&nbsp;hp/tonne, the 2S25 can operate in high altitudes of up to 4000 m, while the installed rubber-clad shoes or snow-riding tracks expand the vehicle's capabilities in various climates.<ref name=tplant /> According to the manufacturer, the 2S25 can also be employed as a light amphibious tank by rapid deployment forces, airborne, marine and special purpose units. With its low weight, it can become essential in mountains and swamps regions, where heavy equipment cannot travel. The 2S25 is designed to be parachuted from aircraft such as the [[Il-76]] with the crew inside, allowing nearly immediate combat readiness upon landing to provide high firepower alongside paratroopers.<ref name=2s25 />\n\nThe tank destroyer Sprut-SD is tasked specifically with seeking out and destroying enemy tanks and armoured fighting vehicles, whether from an entrenched position or actively hunting. Although, the relatively large gun provided with such a mobile, airborne chassis allows significant fire support for paratroopers, allowing sustained contact when engaging hard targets, such as entrenchments, fortifications and concrete structures (an often difficult task for airborne or light infantry).
