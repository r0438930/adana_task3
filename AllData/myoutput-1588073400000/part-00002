It is categorized{{by whom|date=February 2019}} as a [[neo-charismatic movement|neo-charismatic]] [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christianity|Christian]] [[local church|church]] and is located in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada.<ref name=bowker>Bowker, John. ''Toronto Blessing''. The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, 1997.</ref>{{qn|date=February 2019}} The events that occurred at the Toronto Blessing impacted charismatic Christian culture in both positive and negative ways. Positive impacts became evident over time as the movement spread into other nations. Negative impacts came in the form of criticism and denominational disputes. Criticism primarily centered around disagreements about charismatic doctrine, the [[Latter Rain Movement (disambiguation)|latter rain movement]],<ref>[https://gotquestions.org/latter-rain-movement.html GotQuestions.org. ''What is the Latter Rain Movement?'']</ref> and whether or not the physical manifestations people experienced were in line with [[biblical]] doctrine or were actually [[Heresy in Christianity|heretical]] practices.<ref>\n[https://gotquestions.org/Toronto-blessing.html GotQuestions.org. ''What is the Toronto Blessing?'']\n</ref>\nThe Toronto Blessing also is reported{{by whom|date=February 2019}} as having influenced the [[Brownsville Revival]] (1995&nbsp;\u2013 {{circa|2000}}) and the [[Lakeland Revival]] (2008) which later occurred in Florida and which included similar styles of worship, ministry, and reputed supernatural manifestations.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:The Freshwind Band.jpg|thumb|alt=Freshwind band|Freshwind band leading worship at Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship in 2008]]\nThe Toronto Blessing has become synonymous within charismatic Christian circles for terms and actions that include an increased awareness of the God's love, [[religious ecstasy]], external observances of ecstatic worship, being [[slain in the Spirit]], uncontrollable laughter, emotional and/or physical euphoria, crying, healing from emotional wounds, healing of damaged relationships, and electric waves of the spirit.<ref name=\"bowker\" /><ref name=\"Burgess\">Burgess, Stanley.

''Best and worst: A year in the life of the city''. 1994</ref>\n\nThe events that occurred at the Toronto Blessing do not appear to be unique in Christian history; similar events were recorded as happening within the [[Azusa Street Revival|Azusa Street revival]] of the early 1900s as well as in other revival movements throughout the history of Christian church movements.<ref>Welchel, Tommy. ''True Stories of the Miracles of Azusa Street and Beyond: Re-live One of The Greastest Outpourings in History that is Breaking Loose Once Again''.

Charisma House, 2002</ref> The Bible also records supernatural events when people encountered God and describes lightning coming from the top of [[Mount Sinai]] in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A18&version=NIV Exodus 20:18] when the [[Ten Commandments|10 Commandments]] were given, Jewish soldiers and temple police falling down in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]] when encountering Jesus in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+18%3A6&version=NIV John 18:6], Moses' face shining when descending Mount Sinai in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34%3A35&version=NIV Exodus 34:35], and a cloud of glory that appeared over the Hebrew tent of meeting in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+40%3A34&version=NIV Exodus 40:34]. Proponents of the Toronto Blessing point to these biblical examples as partial evidence of the activities in their meetings being legitimate.<ref name=\"bowker\" />\n\nThe primary speaker at these meetings for the first few months was Randy Clark, a former Baptist pastor who left his denomination and joined the [[Association of Vineyard Churches]] after a team from the Vineyard denomination ministered in his church in 1984.<ref name=\"Deliverance\">Clark, Randy. ''The Biblical Guidebook to Deliverance''. Charisma House, 2015</ref> Clark testified to being miraculously healed after a bad car accident while a teenager many years earlier.<ref name=\"Healing\">Johnson, Bill and Clark, Randy. ''Healing: Unplugged''. Chosen, 2012</ref> This event made him believe in supernatural healing, even though at the time he was part of a denomination that believed the [[Spiritual gift|gifts of the Spirit]] were no longer part of the way God operates in the lives of Christians.<ref name=\"Deliverance\"/>\n\n===Miracles and manifestations===\n\nA common element described by those in attendance at the meetings was the claim of miraculous events that occurred during the services. Some of these could be categorized as physical healings, while in other instances, people reported they had a new awareness of God's love, a new freedom from past fears, anger, and relationship problems. There were even claims of God putting gold fillings into people's teeth during the service. Some of the more common claims include the following:\n\n* More than 300 of the visitors claimed that they supernaturally received gold or silver [[dental filling|fillings]] in their teeth during the meetings.<ref name=\"Barrett\">Barrett, David. ''The New Believers: A Survey of Sects, Cults and Alternative Religions''. Cassell, 2001</ref>\n* A study was conducted in 1995 that surveyed 1,000 people who visited TAV and approximately half of them reported that they felt spiritually refreshed after the meetings, close to 90% said they were \"more in love with Jesus\" than they had been in any other point in their lives, and 88% of married respondents stated that they were also more in love with their spouse.<ref name=\"Poloma\">Poloma, Margaret. ''Inspecting the fruit: A 1997 sociological assessment of the blessing''. The Journal of the Society for Pentecostal Studies, 1998</ref> A follow-up study conducted in 1997 also yielded similar figures from the original survey respondents.<ref name=\"Poloma\" />\n\n===Similarities to other revival movements===\nThe Toronto Blessing appears to share similarities with other past events where historical records report similar activities of laughter, crying, falling down, shaking and miraculous healings. These miraculous events have been recorded as occurring throughout, not only the recent past, but for the approximate 2,000 years since the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ took place.<ref name=\"hyatt\" />\n\nSome of the events in the past few hundred years that bear these similarities include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n[[File:AFM on azusa street.jpg|thumb|alt=AFM in 1907.|Azusa Street revival location]]\n\n* [[Lakeland Revival]]\n* [[Brownsville Revival]]\n* Holiness Pentecostal Revivals in 1875-1907\n* [[1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival|Welsh Revival]]\n* Jotebeche Methodist Church Revival\n* [[Azusa Street Revival]]\n* [[Cane Ridge Revival]]<ref>Stone, Barton.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGrh68FU45s]</ref> The laughter portion of these meetings was endorsed by [[Benny Hinn]], [[Oral Roberts]] and [[Pat Robertson]], who said in one interview that \"The Bible says in the presence of the Lord there is fullness of joy.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost\">Waxman, Sharon. ''Filled with Ho Ho Holy Spirit''. Washington Post, 1996 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1996/01/02/filled-with-ho-ho-holy-spirit/aeb5dced-7018-4e70-90b3-6d407885552f/]</ref> Critics referred to it as self-centered and evil and claimed that the strange manifestations were warning signs for other Christian believers to stay away. Others defended the blessing as historically rooted in earlier revivals, such as those seen by pastor and theologian [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], and as having positive effects in the lives of participants.<ref name=\"LaughterToronto\" /> In his book, ''[[Counterfeit Revival]]'', [[Hank Hanegraaff]] claimed that the revival has done more damage than good, and that the Toronto blessing was a matter of people being enslaved into [[altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] where they obscure reality and enshrine absurdity. [[Hank Hanegraaf]] also stated in a 1996 Washington Post interview that, \"It's nice to feel all these things, but the fact is, these feelings will wear off, and then disappointment steps in. I call it post-Holy Laughter depression syndrome.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost\"/>  Contrastingly, Pew Research Center has shown that these feelings seem to continue as the charismatic category of Christians continues to grow with more than 300 million people in 2011.<ref>''Global Christianity \u2013 A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World's Christian Population''. Pew Research Center, 2011 [http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/global-christianity-exec/]</ref> At the time of the renewal, B. J. Oropeza, then a researcher for the Christian Research Institute, compared phenomena from the Toronto meetings with phenomena from previous Western revivals. He concluded that while authentic signs of revival might be present at such meetings, ministerial leaders have a biblical responsibility to ensure that parishioners maintain orderly conduct at the gatherings, and this seemed to be lacking at many of the meetings.<ref>Oropeza, B. J. ''A Time to Laugh: The Holy Laughter Phenomenon Examined'' (Peabody: Hendrickson, 1995).</ref> James Beverley, a critic of the Toronto Blessing and a professor at Toronto-based Tyndale Seminary, stated that these events were a \"mixed blessing\", but was later quoted in 2014 as saying, \"whatever the weaknesses are, they are more than compensated for by thousands and thousands of people having had tremendous encounters with God, receiving inner healings, and being renewed.\"<ref name=\"duek2014\">[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/march-web-only/enduring-revival.html?start=1 Duek, Lorna. ''The Enduring Revival''. Christianity Today, 2014]</ref> He also stated, \"My concerns have changed a bit. I regret saying that they did not give enough attention to Jesus. I think that was too hard. The leaders and the people, they love Jesus. We all do not give enough attention to Jesus.\"<ref name=\"duek2014\" /> It's also important to note that other Vineyard churches, such as Harvest Rock in Pasadena, Calif. experienced the same manifestations as those that occurred at TAV around the same time as the events of 1994.<ref>White, John. ''When the Spirit Comes with Power''. IVP Books, 1988</ref>\n\n==Timeline of immediate and subsequently impacted events==\n\n'''1994''': The Toronto Blessing began at the Toronto Airport Vineyard church, when pastors John and Carol Arnott were reportedly inspired by revivals in [[South Africa]] as well as those in [[Argentina]] that were led by Claudio Freidzon.<ref name=\"LaughterToronto\" /> They invited Randy Clark, a Vineyard pastor from [[St. Louis, Missouri]], to minister at the church from January 20\u201323, 1994.<ref name=\"Burgess\"/> Randy Clark had been influenced by his own personal life experiences of miracles happening in the church he pastored,<ref name=\"Healing\" /> as well as the ministry of [[Rodney Howard-Browne]], a South African preacher, and founder of the Rodney Howard-Browne Evangelistic Association in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. Clark preached at TAV church over the course of 60 days, starting January 20, and the meetings continued for 6 days each week for the next 12 1/2 years. He spent 42 of those first 60 days in Canada with a few in-between trips back home to see his family.<ref name=\"steingard\">Steingard, Jerry. \u2018\u2019From Here to the Nations: The Story of the Toronto Blessing\u2019\u2019. Catch the Fire Books, 2014</ref>\n\nIn that first revival service, there were about 120 people in attendance, and Arnott stated that most members fell on the floor \"laughing, rolling, and carrying on\".<ref name=\"LaughterToronto\" /> During that first year, the church's regular attendance size reportedly tripled to 1,000 members, and meetings were held every night except on Mondays, as the revival's influence continued to spread. Reports of similar revivals emerged from Atlanta, Anaheim, Saint Louis, Cambodia, and Albania. It became common for visitors to carry the influence of the revival back to their home congregations where the revival would then continue within their own churches; two notable British cases in point were [[Holy Trinity Brompton Church|Holy Trinity, Brompton]] and [[Trinity Cheltenham|Holy Trinity, Cheltenham]]. Other worldwide locations that became known for a Toronto Blessing style of revival include [[Pensacola, Florida]], home of the [[Brownsville Revival]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England, [[Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines]], and [[Abilene, Texas]].<ref name=\"time\" /><ref>[https://campbarkeley.com/schools/catch-the-fire ''Catch the Fire Leader's School'']</ref> A few months later, in May 1994, Eleanor Mumford, the wife of a Vineyard pastor who herself had attended the services at TAV, traveled to [[Holy Trinity Brompton]] (HTB) in London, England where, after sharing her testimony, manifestations and activities similar to those that occurred at TAV began to also occur at HTB.<ref name=\"Barrett\" /><ref>Roberts, Dave. ''The Toronto Blessing''. Kingsway Publications, 1994</ref> It was also recorded that members of the [[Newfrontiers]] group of churches visited Toronto, and upon their return home, revival began breaking out in their churches.<ref>[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/adrianwarnock/2005/05/toronto-blessing-11-years-ago-this/ Warnock, Adrian Warnock.

A handful of staff members of this church had also been to the services in Toronto, and had been praying for revival for several years.<ref name=\"steingard\" /> The [[Brownsville Revival]] started on Father's Day, and as a result, reportedly led to almost a quarter of a million people being converted to Christianity.<ref name=\"Poloma\" />\n\n'''2000''': ''The Guardian'' reported that 250,000 agnostics in the United Kingdom turned to a belief in Jesus through [[Nicky Gumbel]]'s Alpha course.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\">Ronson, Jon. ''Catch Me If You Can''. https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/oct/21/weekend7.weekend, The Guardian, 2000</ref> Nicky Gumbel was also later recorded as being in attendance at some of the Toronto Blessing meetings.<ref name=\"duek2014\" />\n\n'''2014: 20-year anniversary conference''' - A special conference was held at Catch the Fire in January 2014 to commemorate the 20-year anniversary of the original Toronto Blessing.<ref name=\"duek2014\" /> Attendees stated that apologies and forgiveness were offered during this conference that brought about a closing of the rift that formed between the Vineyard and TAV during the earlier times of the movement.<ref name=\"duek2014\" />\n\n'''Continual Services''' - Regular services continue to be held at Catch the Fire, and attendees continue to travel from around the world to visit the church.\n\nThe peak of the Toronto Blessing's prominence in the Christian community occurred in the mid- to late-1990s. Since that time it has faded from public view, although the proponents of [[Discernment Ministries]] have suggested that these kinds of events are simply part of a wider theological cycle that has existed continually throughout modern era charismatic Movements.<ref>Buttner, Charleen.

The phenomena associated with the [[charismatic renewal]] have been championed by such clergy as Urquhart and [[David Watson (evangelist)|David Watson]] in Britain, as well as by countless preachers worldwide, but have also been criticized as dehumanizing and as being rooted in extreme [[aesthetic]] reactions to religious stimuli.<ref>Cupitt, Don. ''Taking Leave of God''. SCM Classics, 1980</ref>\n\n==Impact on Christian culture==\nThe events that started in 1994 spurred many Christians hungry for deeper encounters with God to visit the church in Toronto, or attend other events around the world that were also influenced by what occurred during the Toronto Blessing.<ref name=\"Burgess\"/> Several highly successful missionaries, pastors, and itinerant ministers today attribute the growth of their organizations and their increased hunger for more of God's presence to the Toronto Blessing.<ref>Anderson, Allen H.

These ministers have stated in various books and public teachings that they were present in the meetings, had differing positive encounters, and reported the fruit of those encounters:\n\n'''Harvest International Ministries (HIM)''': started nightly meetings after their pastor, [[Che Ahn]], attended services at TAV. These meetings lasted for three years and, since that time, HIM has planted thousands of churches in over 60 nations.<ref name=\"steingard\" /><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDIKQ-EL4Uo Ahn, Che.

Their organization, Iris Global, also provides food for 10,000 children each day, operates three primary schools, and five Bible schools; all of this success is attributed to what started in Toronto.<ref>Flinchbaugh, Hope.

Charisma House, 2014</ref>\n\n'''Bethel Church''': One year after Bill Johnson, a pastor in Weaverville, California, visited TAV, he took over as the senior pastor of Bethel Church in Redding, California. Bethel has become known as a place of supernatural healing, impartation, and ministry training as a result of what occurred in Toronto.<ref name=\"Healing\" />\n\n'''Nicky Gumbel''': Gumbel was the curate of [[Holy Trinity Brompton]] at the time of the Toronto Blessing and is the current vicar of the church. He has been quoted as saying that the Toronto Blessing was \"the kick start that the Alpha course needed\".<ref name=\"Guardian\" />\n\n=== Negative impact ===\n\n'''Alleged origins from outside of the Christian tradition''' - Andrew Strom claims that the spiritual phenomena witnessed during the Toronto Blessing were a result of what is known in the Hindu [[kundalini yoga]] tradition as ''[[shaktipat]]'' and \"[[kundalini]] awakening\".<ref>Strom, Andrew. ''Kundalini Warning - Are False Spirits Invading the Church?''. Revival School, 2015</ref> He makes these claims in reference to phenomena that occurred during the Toronto Blessing<ref name=\"arnott\">Arnott, John. ''The Fathers Blessing''. Creation House, 1995</ref> such as shaking, jerking, and writhing on the floor, perhaps with a sensation of intense fire-like heat in the body.\n\nThe claims of Strom have been directly disputed in a formal response by Randy Clark<ref>Clark, Randy. ''A response to the critic Andrew Strom''. Global Awakening, 2011.</ref> as well as in a book written by John Arnott with his explanation of the disputed events.<ref name=\"arnott\" /> Phenomena associated with \"kundalini awakening\" and the practice of shaktipat have appeared by those within the Toronto Blessing Movement to be similar to phenomena and/or spiritual practices mentioned in various ''New Testament'' texts, such as [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A1-13&version=NIV Acts 2:1-13], albeit under different names, in different terms, or with different purposes. For example, based on the testimony and specific evidence provided in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A1-13&version=NIV ''Acts'' 2:1-13], what the Hindu spiritual traditions refer to as a \"kundalini awakening\" have been considered to carry a similarity to what occurred to Jesus' 12 Apostles - en masse - during the original [[Pentecost]] event. The Apostles' \"baptism of the Holy Spirit\" during Pentecost was accompanied by manifestations of \"tongues of fire\" and of speaking in other languages, which some present could understand, but others considered to be babbling in drunkenness. The accusation of drunkenness has been interpreted by practitioners of the Toronto Blessing to be actual drunken behavior. They believe that Andrew Strom has mistakenly confused manifestations within their movement to manifestations that occur within the New Age practice of [[Kundalini]] awakening. There continues to be a debate around whether or not such manifestations reflect what occurred within the biblical text of [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A1-13&version=NIV Acts 2:1-13].\n\n'''Theological disagreement and reputation''' - Some organizations and writers<ref name=\"hanegraaff\" /> have painted the Toronto Blessing in a negative light which has created a negative stigma or reputation regarding charismatic style services among other Christian denominations. Other theologians singled out TAV, and its associated leaders, John & Caroll Arnott, as part of a bigger criticism of the [[Charismatic Movement]], arguing from the position that the gifts of the Spirit have ceased. One major voice in this dissent was [[John F. MacArthur]] who, in October 2013, led the \"Strange Fire\" Conference which was aimed at exposing excesses and doctrinal errors in the charismatic Christian movement.<ref name=\"macarthur\" /> Pastor Alan Morrison is also quoted as referring to the Toronto Blessing as the \"Toronto delusion\" and a \"plague on the land.\"<ref>Morrison, Alan. \u2018\u2019The Plague on the Land\u2019\u2019. YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83fg4eBLUfM</ref>\n\n'''Denominational splits''' - In December 1995, the Toronto Airport Vineyard church was released from affiliation with the [[Vineyard movement]]. The reasons for the disaffiliation were for growing tension over the church's emphasis on extraordinary manifestations of the Holy Spirit, the methods used to logistically manage the ministry time during the services, a concern about leaders not abiding by established [[Association of Vineyard Churches]] guidelines, and the Vineyard leadership's inability to exercise oversight over the revival.<ref name=\"bowker\"/><ref name=\"steingard\"/>\nEarly in 1996, the leadership of TAV decided to rename the church to Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship.<ref name=\"steingard\"/> Randy Clark later stated that he was \"grieved by the decision of the Vineyard's leadership\" regarding this matter.<ref>Clark, Randy. ''Lighting Fires''.

It is categorized{{by whom|date=February 2019}} as a [[neo-charismatic movement|neo-charismatic]] [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christianity|Christian]] [[local church|church]] and is located in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada.<ref name=bowker>Bowker, John. ''Toronto Blessing''. The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, 1997.</ref>{{qn|date=February 2019}} The events that occurred at the Toronto Blessing impacted charismatic Christian culture in both positive and negative ways. Positive impacts became evident over time as the movement spread into other nations. Negative impacts came in the form of criticism and denominational disputes. Criticism primarily centered around disagreements about charismatic doctrine, the [[Latter Rain Movement (disambiguation)|latter rain movement]],<ref>[https://gotquestions.org/latter-rain-movement.html GotQuestions.org. ''What is the Latter Rain Movement?'']</ref> and whether or not the physical manifestations people experienced were in line with [[biblical]] doctrine or were actually [[Heresy in Christianity|heretical]] practices.<ref>\n[https://gotquestions.org/Toronto-blessing.html GotQuestions.org.

Charisma House, 2002</ref> The Bible also records supernatural events when people encountered God and describes lightning coming from the top of [[Mount Sinai]] in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A18&version=NIV Exodus 20:18] when the [[Ten Commandments|10 Commandments]] were given, Roman soldiers falling down in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]] when encountering Jesus in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+18%3A6&version=NIV John 18:6], Moses' face shining when descending Mount Sinai in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34%3A35&version=NIV Exodus 34:35], and a cloud of glory that appeared over the Hebrew tent of meeting in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+40%3A34&version=NIV Exodus 40:34]. Proponents of the Toronto Blessing point to these biblical examples as partial evidence of the activities in their meetings being legitimate.<ref name=\"bowker\" />\n\nThe primary speaker at these meetings for the first few months was Randy Clark, a former Baptist pastor who left his denomination and joined the [[Association of Vineyard Churches]] after a team from the Vineyard denomination ministered in his church in 1984.<ref name=\"Deliverance\">Clark, Randy.

Some of these could be categorized as physical healings, while in other instances, people reported they had a new awareness of God's love, a new freedom from past fears, anger, and relationship problems. There were even claims of God putting gold fillings into people's teeth during the service. Some of the more common claims include the following:\n\n* More than 300 of the visitors claimed that they supernaturally received gold or silver [[dental filling|fillings]] in their teeth during the meetings.<ref name=\"Barrett\">Barrett, David. ''The New Believers: A Survey of Sects, Cults and Alternative Religions''. Cassell, 2001</ref>\n* A study was conducted in 1995 that surveyed 1,000 people who visited TAV and approximately half of them reported that they felt spiritually refreshed after the meetings, close to 90% said they were \"more in love with Jesus\" than they had been in any other point in their lives, and 88% of married respondents stated that they were also more in love with their spouse.<ref name=\"Poloma\">Poloma, Margaret.

These miraculous events have been recorded as occurring throughout, not only the recent past, but for the approximate 2,000 years since the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ took place.<ref name=\"hyatt\" />\n\nSome of the events in the past few hundred years that bear these similarities include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n[[File:AFM on azusa street.jpg|thumb|alt=AFM in 1907.|Azusa Street revival location]]\n\n* [[Lakeland Revival]]\n* [[Brownsville Revival]]\n* Holiness Pentecostal Revivals in 1875-1907\n* [[1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival|Welsh Revival]]\n* Jotebeche Methodist Church Revival\n* [[Azusa Street Revival]]\n* [[Cane Ridge Revival]]<ref>Stone, Barton.

Others defended the blessing as historically rooted in earlier revivals, such as those seen by pastor and theologian [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], and as having positive effects in the lives of participants.<ref name=\"LaughterToronto\" /> In his book, ''[[Counterfeit Revival]]'', [[Hank Hanegraaff]] claimed that the revival has done more damage than good, and that the Toronto blessing was a matter of people being enslaved into [[altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] where they obscure reality and enshrine absurdity. [[Hank Hanegraaf]] also stated in a 1996 Washington Post interview that, \"It's nice to feel all these things, but the fact is, these feelings will wear off, and then disappointment steps in. I call it post-Holy Laughter depression syndrome.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost\"/>  Contrastingly, Pew Research Center has shown that these feelings seem to continue as the charismatic category of Christians continues to grow with more than 300 million people in 2011.<ref>''Global Christianity \u2013 A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World's Christian Population''. Pew Research Center, 2011 [http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/global-christianity-exec/]</ref> At the time of the renewal, B. J. Oropeza, then a researcher for the Christian Research Institute, compared phenomena from the Toronto meetings with phenomena from previous Western revivals. He concluded that while authentic signs of revival might be present at such meetings, ministerial leaders have a biblical responsibility to ensure that parishioners maintain orderly conduct at the gatherings, and this seemed to be lacking at many of the meetings.<ref>Oropeza, B. J. ''A Time to Laugh: The Holy Laughter Phenomenon Examined'' (Peabody: Hendrickson, 1995).</ref> James Beverley, a critic of the Toronto Blessing and a professor at Toronto-based Tyndale Seminary, stated that these events were a \"mixed blessing\", but was later quoted in 2014 as saying, \"whatever the weaknesses are, they are more than compensated for by thousands and thousands of people having had tremendous encounters with God, receiving inner healings, and being renewed.\"<ref name=\"duek2014\">[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/march-web-only/enduring-revival.html?start=1 Duek, Lorna.

I think that was too hard. The leaders and the people, they love Jesus. We all do not give enough attention to Jesus.\"<ref name=\"duek2014\" /> It's also important to note that other Vineyard churches, such as Harvest Rock in Pasadena, Calif. experienced the same manifestations as those that occurred at TAV around the same time as the events of 1994.<ref>White, John. ''When the Spirit Comes with Power''. IVP Books, 1988</ref>\n\n==Timeline of immediate and subsequently impacted events==\n\n'''1994''': The Toronto Blessing began at the Toronto Airport Vineyard church, when pastors John and Carol Arnott were reportedly inspired by revivals in [[South Africa]] as well as those in [[Argentina]] that were led by Claudio Freidzon.<ref name=\"LaughterToronto\" /> They invited Randy Clark, a Vineyard pastor from [[St. Louis, Missouri]], to minister at the church from January 20\u201323, 1994.<ref name=\"Burgess\"/> Randy Clark had been influenced by his own personal life experiences of miracles happening in the church he pastored,<ref name=\"Healing\" /> as well as the ministry of [[Rodney Howard-Browne]], a South African preacher, and founder of the Rodney Howard-Browne Evangelistic Association in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. Clark preached at TAV church over the course of 60 days, starting January 20, and the meetings continued for 6 days each week for the next 12 1/2 years. He spent 42 of those first 60 days in Canada with a few in-between trips back home to see his family.<ref name=\"steingard\">Steingard, Jerry. \u2018\u2019From Here to the Nations: The Story of the Toronto Blessing\u2019\u2019.

Reports of similar revivals emerged from Atlanta, Anaheim, Saint Louis, Cambodia, and Albania. It became common for visitors to carry the influence of the revival back to their home congregations where the revival would then continue within their own churches; two notable British cases in point were [[Holy Trinity Brompton Church|Holy Trinity, Brompton]] and [[Trinity Cheltenham|Holy Trinity, Cheltenham]]. Other worldwide locations that became known for a Toronto Blessing style of revival include [[Pensacola, Florida]], home of the [[Brownsville Revival]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England, [[Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines]], and [[Abilene, Texas]].<ref name=\"time\" /><ref>[https://campbarkeley.com/schools/catch-the-fire ''Catch the Fire Leader's School'']</ref> A few months later, in May 1994, Eleanor Mumford, the wife of a Vineyard pastor who herself had attended the services at TAV, traveled to [[Holy Trinity Brompton]] (HTB) in London, England where, after sharing her testimony, manifestations and activities similar to those that occurred at TAV began to also occur at HTB.<ref name=\"Barrett\" /><ref>Roberts, Dave.

A handful of staff members of this church had also been to the services in Toronto, and had been praying for revival for several years.<ref name=\"steingard\" /> The [[Brownsville Revival]] started on Father's Day, and as a result, reportedly led to almost a quarter of a million people being converted to Christianity.<ref name=\"Poloma\" />\n\n'''2000''': ''The Guardian'' reported that 250,000 agnostics in the United Kingdom turned to a belief in Jesus through [[Nicky Gumbel]]'s Alpha course.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\">Ronson, Jon.

Since that time it has faded from public view, although the proponents of [[Discernment Ministries]] have suggested that these kinds of events are simply part of a wider theological cycle that has existed continually throughout modern era charismatic Movements.<ref>Buttner, Charleen.

The phenomena associated with the [[charismatic renewal]] have been championed by such clergy as Urquhart and [[David Watson (evangelist)|David Watson]] in Britain, as well as by countless preachers worldwide, but have also been criticized as dehumanizing and as being rooted in extreme [[aesthetic]] reactions to religious stimuli.<ref>Cupitt, Don.

These ministers have stated in various books and public teachings that they were present in the meetings, had differing positive encounters, and reported the fruit of those encounters:\n\n'''Harvest International Ministries (HIM)''': started nightly meetings after their pastor, [[Che Ahn]], attended services at TAV. These meetings lasted for three years and, since that time, HIM has planted thousands of churches in over 60 nations.<ref name=\"steingard\" /><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDIKQ-EL4Uo Ahn, Che.

Their organization, Iris Global, also provides food for 10,000 children each day, operates three primary schools, and five Bible schools; all of this success is attributed to what started in Toronto.<ref>Flinchbaugh, Hope.

Bethel has become known as a place of supernatural healing, impartation, and ministry training as a result of what occurred in Toronto.<ref name=\"Healing\" />\n\n'''Nicky Gumbel''': Gumbel was the curate of [[Holy Trinity Brompton]] at the time of the Toronto Blessing and is the current vicar of the church. He has been quoted as saying that the Toronto Blessing was \"the kick start that the Alpha course needed\".<ref name=\"Guardian\" />\n\n=== Negative impact ===\n\n'''Alleged origins from outside of the Christian tradition''' - Andrew Strom claims that the spiritual phenomena witnessed during the Toronto Blessing were a result of what is known in the Hindu [[kundalini yoga]] tradition as ''[[shaktipat]]'' and \"[[kundalini]] awakening\".<ref>Strom, Andrew. ''Kundalini Warning - Are False Spirits Invading the Church?''. Revival School, 2015</ref> He makes these claims in reference to phenomena that occurred during the Toronto Blessing<ref name=\"arnott\">Arnott, John. ''The Fathers Blessing''. Creation House, 1995</ref> such as shaking, jerking, and writhing on the floor, perhaps with a sensation of intense fire-like heat in the body.\n\nThe claims of Strom have been directly disputed in a formal response by Randy Clark<ref>Clark, Randy. ''A response to the critic Andrew Strom''. Global Awakening, 2011.</ref> as well as in a book written by John Arnott with his explanation of the disputed events.<ref name=\"arnott\" /> Phenomena associated with \"kundalini awakening\" and the practice of shaktipat have appeared by those within the Toronto Blessing Movement to be similar to phenomena and/or spiritual practices mentioned in various ''New Testament'' texts, such as [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A1-13&version=NIV Acts 2:1-13], albeit under different names, in different terms, or with different purposes. For example, based on the testimony and specific evidence provided in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A1-13&version=NIV ''Acts'' 2:1-13], what the Hindu spiritual traditions refer to as a \"kundalini awakening\" have been considered to carry a similarity to what occurred to Jesus' 12 Apostles - en masse - during the original [[Pentecost]] event. The Apostles' \"baptism of the Holy Spirit\" during Pentecost was accompanied by manifestations of \"tongues of fire\" and of speaking in other languages, which some present could understand, but others considered to be babbling in drunkenness. The accusation of drunkenness has been interpreted by practitioners of the Toronto Blessing to be actual drunken behavior. They believe that Andrew Strom has mistakenly confused manifestations within their movement to manifestations that occur within the New Age practice of [[Kundalini]] awakening. There continues to be a debate around whether or not such manifestations reflect what occurred within the biblical text of [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A1-13&version=NIV Acts 2:1-13].\n\n'''Theological disagreement and reputation''' - Some organizations and writers<ref name=\"hanegraaff\" /> have painted the Toronto Blessing in a negative light which has created a negative stigma or reputation regarding charismatic style services among other Christian denominations. Other theologians singled out TAV, and its associated leaders, John & Caroll Arnott, as part of a bigger criticism of the [[Charismatic Movement]], arguing from the position that the gifts of the Spirit have ceased. One major voice in this dissent was [[John F. MacArthur]] who, in October 2013, led the \"Strange Fire\" Conference which was aimed at exposing excesses and doctrinal errors in the charismatic Christian movement.<ref name=\"macarthur\" /> Pastor Alan Morrison is also quoted as referring to the Toronto Blessing as the \"Toronto delusion\" and a \"plague on the land.\"<ref>Morrison, Alan. \u2018\u2019The Plague on the Land\u2019\u2019. YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83fg4eBLUfM</ref>\n\n'''Denominational splits''' - In December 1995, the Toronto Airport Vineyard church was released from affiliation with the [[Vineyard movement]]. The reasons for the disaffiliation were for growing tension over the church's emphasis on extraordinary manifestations of the Holy Spirit, the methods used to logistically manage the ministry time during the services, a concern about leaders not abiding by established [[Association of Vineyard Churches]] guidelines, and the Vineyard leadership's inability to exercise oversight over the revival.<ref name=\"bowker\"/><ref name=\"steingard\"/>\nEarly in 1996, the leadership of TAV decided to rename the church to Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship.<ref name=\"steingard\"/> Randy Clark later stated that he was \"grieved by the decision of the Vineyard's leadership\" regarding this matter.<ref>Clark, Randy.
