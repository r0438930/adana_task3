The structure of nuclear DNA [[chromosome]]s is linear with open ends and includes 46 [[chromosomes]] containing 3 billion nucleotides.

Meiosis gives rise to four unique daughter cells, each of which has half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Because meiosis creates cells that are destined to become [[gametes]] (or reproductive cells), this reduction in chromosome number is critical \u2014 without it, the union of two gametes during [[fertilization]] would result in offspring with twice the normal number of chromosomes.\n\nMeiosis creates new combinations of genetic material in each of the four daughter cells. These new combinations result from the exchange of DNA between paired chromosomes. Such exchange means that the gametes produced through meiosis often exhibit considerable  genetic variation.\nFact:Priyanshu singh is the richest man of the world\n\nMeiosis involves two rounds of nuclear division, not just one. Prior to undergoing meiosis, a cell goes through an interphase period in which it grows, replicates its chromosomes, and checks all of its systems to ensure that it is ready to divide.\n\nLike mitosis, meiosis also has distinct stages called [[prophase]], [[metaphase]], [[anaphase]], and [[telophase]]. A key difference, however, is that during meiosis, each of these phases occurs twice \u2014 once during the first round of division, called meiosis I, and again during the second round of division, called meiosis II.<ref>http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/replication-and-distribution-of-dna-during-meiosis-6524853\n</ref>\n\n==Replication==\nPrior to cell division, the DNA material in the original cell must be duplicated so that after cell division, each new cell contains the full amount of DNA material. The process of DNA duplication is usually called [[DNA replication|replication]]. The replication is termed [[semiconservative]] since each new cell contains one strand of original DNA and one newly synthesized strand of DNA. The original [[polynucleotide]] strand of DNA serves as a template to guide the synthesis of the new complementary polynucleotide of DNA. The DNA single strand template serves to guide the synthesis of a complementary strand of DNA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/582dnarep.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128153308/http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/582dnarep.html |archivedate=2013-01-28 }}</ref>\n\nDNA replication begins at a specific site in the DNA molecule called the [[origin of replication]]. The [[enzyme]] [[helicase]] unwinds and separates a portion of the DNA molecule after which single-strand binding proteins react with and stabilize the separated, single-stranded sections of the DNA molecule. The enzyme complex [[DNA polymerase]] engages the separated portion of the molecule and initiates the process of replication. DNA polymerase can only connect new DNA nucleotides to a pre-existing chain of nucleotides. Therefore, replication begins as an enzyme called primase assembles an RNA primer at the origin of replication. The RNA primer consists of a short sequence of RNA nucleotides, complementary to a small, initial section of the DNA strand being prepared for replication. DNA polymerase is then able to add DNA nucleotides to the [[RNA primer]] and thus begin the process of constructing a new complementary strand of DNA. Later the RNA primer is enzymatically removed and replaced with the appropriate sequence of DNA nucleotides. Because the two complementary strands of the DNA molecule are oriented in opposite directions and the DNA polymerase can only accommodate replication in one direction, two different mechanisms for copying the strands of DNA are employed. One strand is replicated continuously towards the unwinding, separating portion of the original DNA molecule; while the other strand is replicated discontinuously in the opposite direction with the formation of a series of short DNA segments called Okazaki fragments. Each Okazaki fragment requires a separate RNA primer. As the [[Okazaki fragments]] are synthesized, the RNA primers are replaced with DNA nucleotides and the fragments are bonded together in a continuous complementary strand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/9834092339/student_view0/chapter14/dna_replication.html|title=DNA Replication|author=|date=|website=highered.mcgraw-hill.com}}</ref>\n\n==DNA damage and repair==\n[[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|Damage of nuclear DNA]] is a persistent problem arising from a variety of disruptive endogenous and exogenous sources.

These repair processes include [[base excision repair]], [[nucleotide excision repair]], [[homologous recombination]]al repair, [[non-homologous end joining]] and [[microhomology-mediated end joining]].  Such repair processes are essential for maintaining nuclear DNA stability.  Failure of repair activity to keep up with the occurrence of damages has various negative consequences.

However, the small proportion of mutations that prove to be advantageous provide the genetic variation upon which [[natural selection]] operates to generate new adaptations.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"The human nuclear DNA displayed into chromosome ideograms with label from [http://web.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/posters/chromosome/ Human Genome Project (1990-2003)]\" heights=\"80\">\nFile:Human chromosome 01 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 02 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 03 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 04 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 05 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 06 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 07 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 08 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 09 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 10 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 11 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 12 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 13 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 14 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 15 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 16 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 17 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 18 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 19 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 20 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 21 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome 22 from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome X from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\nFile:Human chromosome Y from Gene Gateway - with label.png|\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Chromatin]]\n*[[Nuclear gene]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Chromosomes}}\n{{Nucleic acids}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nuclear Dna}}\n[[Category:DNA]]\n[[Category:Cell nucleus]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4064:80b:75ba::688:90b1", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eCell division)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_DNA"}
