At a second trial on December 11, 1991, she was convicted of two counts of [[second-degree murder]] and later sentenced to 32-years-to-[[life in prison]].

Her mother was [[Irish-American]] and her father was [[Italian-American]]. \n\nThe Bisceglias were very strict parents, and much was expected of all the Bisceglia children. As Broderick later recalled, she was trained to act as a housewife since the day she was born, or as she recalled: \"Go to [[Catholic school]]s, be careful with dating until you find a Catholic man, support him while he works, be blessed in your later years with beautiful grandchildren\". This Catholic upbringing was bolstered by the economic conditions of the 1950s, when Catholic parents could reasonably expect that a son or son-in-law would be able to support a wife and children on his own income.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://murderpedia.org/female.B/b/broderick-betty.htm\n| title=Elisabeth Anne \"Betty\" BRODERICK\n| date=1997\n| work=Lexxicon, CrimeLibrary.com\n| publisher=Murderpedia\n| accessdate=2018-04-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/family/broderick/1.html\n| title=Betty Broderick: Divorce...

Dan was born in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]; he was the eldest son of a large Catholic family akin to the Bisceglias, and both his parents were descendants of Irish immigrants. The couple married on April 12, 1969 at the [[Immaculate Conception Church (Tuckahoe, New York)|Immaculate Conception Church]] in [[Tuckahoe (village), New York|Tuckahoe]]. Broderick returned from her [[honeymoon]] pregnant with her first child, daughter Kim (b. 1970). She gave birth to four more children: daughter Lee, (b. 1971), two sons named Daniel (b. 1976) and Rhett, (b. 1979) and an unnamed boy, who died two days after birth.<ref name=\"Stumbo\"/>\n\n==Marriage breakdown==\nAfter Kim's birth, Dan completed his [[M.D.]] degree at [[Cornell University]]. He then announced his intention to combine his medical expertise with a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree and enrolled at [[Harvard Law School]]. Broderick became the main provider for the family while Dan attended law school with the help of a student loan. Dan was quickly hired by a law firm in [[San Diego]], [[California]], and moved his family to the nearby community of Coral Reef. Broderick continued working part-time, often selling Tupperware or [[Avon Products|Avon]] products while raising the children as a [[stay-at-home mom]]. \n\nIn the fall of 1982, Dan hired 21-year-old Linda Kolkena (1961\u20131989), a former [[Delta Airlines]] stewardess,<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7539/linda-broderick\n| title=Linda Kolkena Broderick\n| publisher=Find a Grave\n| accessdate=2018-04-28}}</ref> to be his legal assistant. As early as October 1983, Broderick suspected that Dan was having an [[affair]] with Kolkena, and accused her husband of [[infidelity]]. Dan denied having an affair with Kolkena, telling Broderick that she was \"crazy.\" Eventually, the marriage broke down, and against Broderick's wishes, Dan moved out in February 1985.<ref name=\"Producers\"/> He eventually took custody of their children after Broderick dumped the children on his doorstep one by one. Dan eventually confessed to Broderick that her suspicions about his affair with Kolkena were true and a drawn-out and hostile [[divorce]] ensued. ''Broderick vs. Broderick'' became one of the more infamous divorce cases in the US, primarily because of issues involving women who had worked while putting their husbands through graduate and professional school.\n\nThe divorce was finalized in 1989, four years after Dan filed the petition. Broderick's behavior became increasingly violent and irrational. Broderick left hundreds of profane messages on Dan's answering machine, ignored countless [[restraining order]]s that forbade her from setting foot on Dan's property, [[vandalism|vandalized]] his new home, and even drove her car into his front door despite the fact that their children were inside the house at the time.\n\nOn April 22, 1989, Dan and Kolkena were married. Kolkena had been concerned about Broderick's behavior and even recommended Dan wear a [[bulletproof vest]] to the nuptials. However, Broderick did not appear and the wedding proceeded without incident.<ref name=\"Stumbo\"/> After the wedding, Broderick claimed Linda taunted her by sending facial cream and slimming treatment ads by mail.\n\n==Murders==\nEight months after buying a [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and seven months after Dan and Linda were married, Betty Broderick drove to Dan's house at 1041 Cypress Avenue in the [[Marston Hills, San Diego|Marston Hills]] neighborhood near [[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]] in [[San Diego]].<ref name=\"Producers\"/> Broderick used a key that she had stolen from her daughter Lee to enter the house while the couple slept; she shot and killed them. The murders occurred at 5:30&nbsp;a.m. on Sunday, November 5, 1989\u2014two days before Betty's 42nd birthday. Two bullets hit Linda in the head and chest, killing her instantly; one bullet hit Dan in the chest as he apparently was reaching for a phone; one bullet hit the wall, and one bullet hit a nightstand. Dan was 44 (17 days shy of his 45th birthday); Linda was 28.\n\nEvidence that worked against Betty at trial was the fact that she removed a phone/answering machine from Dan Broderick's bedroom so that he could not call for help.  Medical evidence indicated that Dan had not died right away, and Betty admitted that he had spoken to her after she had shot him. Dan's last words were, \"Okay, you shot me. I'm dead.\"\n\nAfter contacting her daughter Lee and Lee's boyfriend, Broderick turned herself in to police, never denying that she had indeed pulled the trigger five times. Broderick's explanation at both trials was that she had never planned to kill Dan and Linda and that her crime was not premeditated. Her account of the murders at her second trial was that she was startled by Linda's screaming, \"Call the police!\" and immediately fired the gun.\n\nLinda and Dan Broderick are listed as buried together at [[Greenwood Memorial Park (San Diego)|Greenwood Memorial Park]] in San Diego.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-betty-broderick-20160806-snap-story.html\n| title='Your heart is still bitter,' infamous killer Betty Broderick is told in parole denial\n| first=Greg\n| last=Moran\n| date=2016-08-06\n| work=[[LA Times]]\n| accessdate=2017-06-15}}</ref>\n\n==Trials==\nAttorney Jack Early represented Broderick at trial. Kerry Wells prosecuted for the State of California. Broderick's defense was that she had been a [[battered woman defense|battered wife]], claiming that she was driven over the edge by years of psychological, physical, and mental abuse at the hands of her ex-husband. Wells portrayed Broderick as a murderer who planned and schemed to kill her ex-husband and argued to the jury that Broderick was not a battered woman. She had, after all, been getting $16,000 a month in alimony in addition to the salary she earned working at an art gallery. She was also living in a $650,000 La Jolla beach-front property that Dan had bought for her, she had two cars, she had a boyfriend who was living with her at the time of the murders, and she currently had her two younger sons living with her.\n\nDr. [[Park Dietz]], for the prosecution, used the analysis of Dr. Melvin Goldzband, who previously worked on the case for the prosecution. Dietz said Broderick has [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] and [[narcissistic personality disorder]]s.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-11-27/local/me-187_1_personality-disorders\n| title=Broderick's Rage Linked to Disorders, Psychiatrist Says : Killings: Dual-personality disturbances triggered her wild homicidal fury, a veteran of high-profile criminal trials testifies.\n| work=[[LA Times]]\n| date=1991-11-27\n| first=Michael\n| last=Granberry\n| accessdate=2017-06-15}}</ref>\n\nBroderick's first trial ended with a [[hung jury]] when two of the jurors held out for [[manslaughter]], citing lack of intent. A mistrial was declared by Judge [[Thomas J. Whelan (judge)|Thomas J. Whelan]]. Betty Broderick was re-tried a year later with the same defense attorney and prosecutor. The second trial was essentially a replay of the first trial. Prosecutor Wells was very successful the second time around, when the jury returned a verdict of two counts of  [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees of murder in the United States|second-degree murder]]. Broderick was sentenced to two consecutive terms of 15 years to life, plus two years for illegal use of a firearm, the maximum under the law.

The murder was also dramatized in the season 4 episode of ''[[Deadly Women]]'', titled \"Till Death Do Us Part\".\n\nBoth before and after Broderick's trials, her story was dramatized across the [[United States]]. Broderick granted numerous television and magazine interviews. She appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' twice, ''[[Hard Copy]]'', ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'', and ''Headliners and Legends''.\n\nAt least four books were written about her story (''Until the Twelfth of Never: The Deadly Divorce of Dan and Betty Broderick'', 1993, by Bella Stumbo; ''Until the Twelfth of Never - Should Betty Broderick ever be free?'', 2013, by Bella Stumbo; ''Forsaking All Others: The Real Betty Broderick Story'', 1993, by Loretta Schwartz-Nobel; ''Hell Hath No Fury'', 1992, by Bryna Taubman), and Broderick was interviewed by ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]'' among other magazines.\n\nThe 1991 ''[[Law & Order]]'' episode \"[[Law & Order (season 2)#ep24|The Wages of Love]]\" was partially inspired by this murder and the trial that followed. Guest star [[Shirley Knight]] was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]].\n\nKaren Kilgariff covered the case in episode 103 of ''[[My Favorite Murder]]'', recorded live in San Diego.\n\nThe second season of the TV series ''[[Dirty John]]'' features the story of Betty and Dan Broderick, from the early years through the homicides.

Her mother was [[Irish-American]] and her father was [[Italian-American]]. \n\nThe Bisceglias were very strict parents, and much was expected of all the Bisceglia children. As Broderick later recalled, she was trained to act as a housewife since the day she was born, or as she recalled: \"Go to [[Catholic school]]s, be careful with dating until you find a Catholic man, support him while he works, be blessed in your later years with beautiful grandchildren\". This Catholic upbringing was bolstered by the economic conditions of the 1950s, when Catholic parents could reasonably expect that a son or son-in-law would be able to support a wife and children on his own income.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://murderpedia.org/female.B/b/broderick-betty.htm\n| title=Elisabeth Anne \"Betty\" BRODERICK\n| date=1997\n| work=Lexxicon, CrimeLibrary.com\n| publisher=Murderpedia\n| accessdate=2018-04-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/family/broderick/1.html\n| title=Betty Broderick: Divorce...

Dan was born in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]; he was the eldest son of a large Catholic family akin to the Bisceglias, and both his parents were descendants of Irish immigrants. The couple married on April 12, 1969 at the [[Immaculate Conception Church (Tuckahoe, New York)|Immaculate Conception Church]] in [[Tuckahoe (village), New York|Tuckahoe]]. Broderick returned from her [[honeymoon]] pregnant with her first child, daughter Kim (b. 1970). She gave birth to four more children: daughter Lee, (b. 1971), two sons named Daniel (b. 1976) and Rhett, (b. 1979) and an unnamed boy, who died two days after birth.<ref name=\"Stumbo\"/>\n\n==Marriage breakdown==\nAfter Kim's birth, Dan completed his [[M.D.]] degree at [[Cornell University]]. He then announced his intention to combine his medical expertise with a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree and enrolled at [[Harvard Law School]]. Broderick became the main provider for the family while Dan attended law school with the help of a student loan. Dan was quickly hired by a law firm in [[San Diego]], [[California]], and moved his family to the nearby community of Coral Reef. Broderick continued working part-time, often selling Tupperware or [[Avon Products|Avon]] products while raising the children as a [[stay-at-home mom]]. \n\nIn the fall of 1982, Dan hired 21-year-old Linda Kolkena (1961\u20131989), a former [[Delta Airlines]] stewardess,<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7539/linda-broderick\n| title=Linda Kolkena Broderick\n| publisher=Find a Grave\n| accessdate=2018-04-28}}</ref> to be his legal assistant. As early as October 1983, Broderick suspected that Dan was having an [[affair]] with Kolkena, and accused her husband of [[infidelity]]. Dan denied having an affair with Kolkena, telling Broderick that she was \"crazy.\" Eventually, the marriage broke down, and against Broderick's wishes, Dan moved out in February 1985.<ref name=\"Producers\"/> He eventually took custody of their children after Broderick dumped the children on his doorstep one by one. Dan eventually confessed to Broderick that her suspicions about his affair with Kolkena were true. Afterwards, a drawn-out and hostile [[divorce]] proceeded. ''Broderick vs. Broderick'' became one of the more infamous divorce cases in the US, primarily because of issues involving women who had worked while putting their husbands through graduate and professional school.\n\nThe divorce was finalized in 1989, four years after Dan filed the petition. Broderick's behavior became increasingly violent and irrational. Broderick left hundreds of profane messages on Dan's answering machine, ignored countless [[restraining order]]s that forbade her from setting foot on Dan's property, [[vandalism|vandalized]] his new home, and even drove her car into his front door despite the fact that their children were inside the house at the time.\n\nOn April 22, 1989, Dan and Kolkena were married. Kolkena had been concerned about Broderick's behavior and even recommended Dan wear a [[bulletproof vest]] to the nuptials. However, Broderick did not appear and the wedding proceeded without incident.<ref name=\"Stumbo\"/> After the wedding, Broderick claimed Linda taunted her by sending facial cream and slimming treatment ads by mail.\n\n==Murders==\nEight months after buying a [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and seven months after Dan and Linda were married, Betty Broderick drove to Dan's house at 1041 Cypress Avenue in the [[Marston Hills, San Diego|Marston Hills]] neighborhood near [[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]] in [[San Diego]].<ref name=\"Producers\"/> Broderick used a key that she had stolen from her daughter Lee to enter the house while the couple slept; she shot and killed them. The murders occurred at 5:30&nbsp;a.m. on Sunday, November 5, 1989\u2014two days before Betty's 42nd birthday. Two bullets hit Linda in the head and chest, killing her instantly; one bullet hit Dan in the chest as he apparently was reaching for a phone; one bullet hit the wall, and one bullet hit a nightstand. Dan was 44 (17 days shy of his 45th birthday); Linda was 28.\n\nEvidence that worked against Betty at trial was the fact that she removed a phone/answering machine from Dan Broderick's bedroom so that he could not call for help.  Medical evidence indicated that Dan had not died right away, and Betty admitted that he had spoken to her after she had shot him. Dan's last words were, \"Okay, you shot me. I'm dead.\"\n\nAfter contacting her daughter Lee and Lee's boyfriend, Broderick turned herself in to police, never denying that she had indeed pulled the trigger five times. Broderick's explanation at both trials was that she had never planned to kill Dan and Linda and that her crime was not premeditated. Her account of the murders at her second trial was that she was startled by Linda's screaming, \"Call the police!\" and immediately fired the gun.\n\nLinda and Dan Broderick are listed as buried together at [[Greenwood Memorial Park (San Diego)|Greenwood Memorial Park]] in San Diego.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-betty-broderick-20160806-snap-story.html\n| title='Your heart is still bitter,' infamous killer Betty Broderick is told in parole denial\n| first=Greg\n| last=Moran\n| date=2016-08-06\n| work=[[LA Times]]\n| accessdate=2017-06-15}}</ref>\n\n==Trials==\nAttorney Jack Early represented Broderick at trial. Kerry Wells prosecuted for the State of California. Broderick's defense was that she had been a [[battered woman defense|battered wife]], claiming that she was driven over the edge by years of psychological, physical, and mental abuse at the hands of her ex-husband. Wells portrayed Broderick as a murderer who planned and schemed to kill her ex-husband and argued to the jury that Broderick was not a battered woman. She had, after all, been getting $16,000 a month in alimony in addition to the salary she earned working at an art gallery. She was also living in a $650,000 La Jolla beach-front property that Dan had bought for her, she had two cars, she had a boyfriend who was living with her at the time of the murders, and she currently had her two younger sons living with her.\n\nDr. [[Park Dietz]], for the prosecution, used the analysis of Dr. Melvin Goldzband, who previously worked on the case for the prosecution. Dietz said Broderick has [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] and [[narcissistic personality disorder]]s.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-11-27/local/me-187_1_personality-disorders\n| title=Broderick's Rage Linked to Disorders, Psychiatrist Says : Killings: Dual-personality disturbances triggered her wild homicidal fury, a veteran of high-profile criminal trials testifies.\n| work=[[LA Times]]\n| date=1991-11-27\n| first=Michael\n| last=Granberry\n| accessdate=2017-06-15}}</ref>\n\nBroderick's first trial ended with a [[hung jury]] when two of the jurors held out for [[manslaughter]], citing lack of intent. A mistrial was declared by Judge [[Thomas J. Whelan (judge)|Thomas J. Whelan]]. Betty Broderick was re-tried a year later with the same defense attorney and prosecutor. The second trial was essentially a replay of the first trial. Prosecutor Wells was very successful the second time around, when the jury returned a verdict of two counts of  [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees of murder in the United States|second-degree murder]]. Broderick was sentenced to two consecutive terms of 15 years to life, plus two years for illegal use of a firearm, the maximum under the law.

The murder was also dramatized in the season 4 episode of ''[[Deadly Women]]'', titled \"Till Death Do Us Part\".\n\nBoth before and after Broderick's trials, her story was dramatized across the [[United States]]. Broderick granted numerous television and magazine interviews. She appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' twice, ''[[Hard Copy]]'', ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'', and ''Headliners and Legends''.\n\nAt least four books were written about her story (''Until the Twelfth of Never: The Deadly Divorce of Dan and Betty Broderick'', 1993, by Bella Stumbo; ''Until the Twelfth of Never - Should Betty Broderick ever be free?'', 2013, by Bella Stumbo; ''Forsaking All Others: The Real Betty Broderick Story'', 1993, by Loretta Schwartz-Nobel; ''Hell Hath No Fury'', 1992, by Bryna Taubman), and Broderick was interviewed by ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]'' among other magazines.\n\nThe 1991 ''[[Law & Order]]'' episode \"[[Law & Order (season 2)#ep24|The Wages of Love]]\" was partially inspired by this murder and the trial that followed. Guest star [[Shirley Knight]] was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]].\n\nKaren Kilgariff covered the case in episode 103 of ''[[My Favorite Murder]]'', recorded live in San Diego.\n\nThe second season of the TV series ''[[Dirty John]]'' features the story of Betty and Dan Broderick, from the early years through the homicides.
