It stated that the playing ranks had been severely depleted over the past season as over 600 players had joined the ranks of the military to fight in the first world war. There were 42 teams in total to compete across six grades (7 in the senior grade, 5 in second grade, 9 in third grade, 7 in the fourth grade, 8 in the fifth grade, and 6 in the sixth grade). Fourteen clubs were affiliated to the Auckland Rugby League with over 800 players in total. The Mangere, Remuera, and [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] clubs withdrew from the competition due to so many of their players going to war.\n\nSignificantly they secured the option of the Chinamen's gardens just off Stanley Street and this was to later be turned into [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Rugby League/Past Season Reviewed\n| page =8\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LIV |issue=16526\n| date = 1917-04-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19170430.2.71.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-14}}</ref>\n\nIt was suggested that the newly-formed Garrison Artillery Club enter a first grade team however as there were already 6 teams competing there was a fear that it would weaken the existing teams. [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] asked for [[Auckland Rugby League]] to request a special Saturday afternoon \u201ctrain to be run to bring players, spectators and the general public to [[Otahuhu]] or Saturday afternoons\u201d during the season.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Arrangements for Saturday\n| page =4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LIII\n| date = 1916-05-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19160510.2.9.1| accessdate = 2019-08-14}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|1915]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=8th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1916}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917]]}}\n    {{end}}\n\n==First grade championship==\nThirty matches were played during the season with the 20 being played at [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]].

There were 42 teams in total to compete across six grades (7 in the senior grade, 5 in second grade, 9 in third grade, 7 in the fourth grade, 8 in the fifth grade, and 6 in the sixth grade). Fourteen clubs were affiliated to the Auckland Rugby League with over 800 players in total. The Mangere, Remuera, and [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] clubs withdrew from the competition due to so many of their players going to war.\n\nSignificantly they secured the option of the Chinamen's gardens just off Stanley Street and this was to later be turned into [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Rugby League/Past Season Reviewed\n| page =8\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LIV |issue=16526\n| date = 1917-04-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19170430.2.71.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-14}}</ref>\n\nIt was suggested that the newly-formed Garrison Artillery Club enter a first grade team however as there were already 6 teams competing there was a fear that it would weaken the existing teams.
