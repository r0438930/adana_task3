It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]]. It is named Carrick East or Carrick Fisher to distinguish it from [[Carrick West]] or Carrick Hassard townland which is in [[Glangevlin]] parish.\n\n==Geography==\n\nCarrick East is bounded on the north by [[Brackley, Templeport]] townland, on the west by [[Killyneary]] townland, on the south by [[Bawnboy]] townland and on the east by [[Gortnavreeghan]] townland. Its chief geographical features are [[Slieve Rushen]] mountain on whose western slope it lies, mountain streams and forestry plantations. Carrick East is traversed by minor roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 127 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nUp until the 19th century Carrick East was composed of two separate townlands, Carrick and Tonnyneask, when they were then merged into a new townland of Carrick East. \n\n===Carrick (pre-1800)===\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Carricar''.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=1609 Baronial-Map | website=Templeport Development Association | url=http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html | ref={{sfnref | Templeport Development Association}} | accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists it as ''Carricke''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts the townland as ''Carrick''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Carik''.<ref>[http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan]</ref>\n\nIt is unclear whether Carrick was granted to anyone in the Plantation of Ulster. The first mention is in an Inquisition of 1638. \n\nIn the [[Plantation of Ulster]] by grant dated 29 April 1611, King [[James VI and I]] granted ''the town and lands of Gortatowill containing 6 polls, comprising a total of 300 acres at an annual rent of \u00a33-4s., to Mulmore McHugh McFarrall O'Rely, gent''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XD5JAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA212&lpg=PA212&dq=gortatowill&source=bl&ots=sGQavYggyh&sig=1un18sPzryyj1ZXIMJOYnxFeAU4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI-MX8pcbZAhXDYlAKHYlcCbwQ6AEIMDAA#v=onepage&q=gortatowill&f=false|title=Calendar of the Patent Rolls of the Chancery of Ireland|first=Ireland|last=Chancery|date=11 April 1800|publisher=A.

He was the grandson of the chief of the [[O'Reilly]] clan, Fearghal macSea\u00e1n, who ruled [[East Breifne]] from 1526\u20131534. His genealogy is ''Maol M\u00f3rdha son of Aodh son of Fearghal son of Sea\u00e1n son of Cathal son of E\u00f3ghan na F\u00e9s\u00f3ige''.<ref>''A Genealogical History of the O\u2019Reillys'' by Eoghan O\u2019Raghallaigh, Section 18, p. 89</ref> Mulmore O'Reilly had four sons by his wife Honora- \u00c9monn [Anglicised as Edmund], [[Hugh O'Reilly (Archbishop of Armagh)]] (b. 1580, d. 1653), Fearghal and Domhnall. He also had an illegitimate son, Cathaoir. Mulmore died sometime between 1611 and 1637. \u00c9monn had three sons, Aodh (Hugh), Cathal and Brian. An Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 12 September 1638 found that the said ''Edm\u2019 Relly recently of Gortetowell in Co. Cavan, in his life, was seised of a poll of land called Tawnagh, and of a poll called '''Carrick''' in said county. The said Edmund died on 29 September 1637. Hugh O\u2019Reyly, his son and heir has reached his maturity and now holds the land from the king in free and common socage. Catherine Newgent, alias Reily, was the wife of the said Edmund and the aforesaid Catherine is dower of the premises.'' Whether Carrick originally formed part of the 1611 grant to Mulmore O'Reilly is unclear. The O'Reillys may have purchased it later as Edmund was the owner in 1637. It then seems to have been sold to the Graham family of Bawnboy as an Inquisition held at [[Belturbet]] on 12 June 1661 found that- ''{{lang|en-emodeng|George Graham, a knight, deceased, in his lifetime was seised as of fee off the town and land of '''Carrigg''', Gosnefrehane and Ballyoghnemoynagh, with several other parcels of land lying in Co. Cavan, containing by estimation 200 acres and with a yearly value, over and above reprises, of \u00a35 sterling. Being seised of such an estate, the aforesaid George by his last will made on 1 May 1615 by and in consideration of his natural affection for William Graham, the younger son of said George, gave the aforesaid town and land with appurtenances to the same William Graham, to his heirs and assigns in perpeuity. The aforesaid William Graham after his father's death, was seised and possessed of these premises by virtue of the said last will, by which the premises were held or are held now without knowledge of the law.}}''<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WUepqE-K4PAC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=Ballyoghnemoynagh&source=bl&ots=q1rxOgZ3Tf&sig=ACfU3U1phE7gd0ttirxCAY1cnUPBJ_F2ZQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjlkb7sg-ToAhUpTxUIHbLrDRwQ6AEwBHoECAsQMQ#v=onepage&q=Ballyoghnemoynagh&f=false]</ref> This seems to imply that Carrick belonged to George Graham in 1615 not the O'Reillys, however it may have been an error made by the 1661 Inquisition as an earlier Inquisition held at [[Cavan]] on 31 October 1627 found that- ''George Greames was seised as of fee, of 20 polls of land in Co.

He was the grandson of the chief of the [[O'Reilly]] clan, Fearghal macSea\u00e1n, who ruled [[East Breifne]] from 1526\u20131534. His genealogy is ''Maol M\u00f3rdha son of Aodh son of Fearghal son of Sea\u00e1n son of Cathal son of E\u00f3ghan na F\u00e9s\u00f3ige''.<ref>''A Genealogical History of the O\u2019Reillys'' by Eoghan O\u2019Raghallaigh, Section 18, p. 89</ref> Mulmore O'Reilly had four sons by his wife Honora- \u00c9monn [Anglicised as Edmund], [[Hugh O'Reilly (Archbishop of Armagh)]] (b. 1580, d. 1653), Fearghal and Domhnall. He also had an illegitimate son, Cathaoir. Mulmore died sometime between 1611 and 1637. \u00c9monn had three sons, Aodh (Hugh), Cathal and Brian. An Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 12 September 1638 found that the said ''Edm\u2019 Relly recently of Gortetowell in Co. Cavan, in his life, was seised of a poll of land called Tawnagh, and of a poll called '''Carrick''' in said county. The said Edmund died on 29 September 1637. Hugh O\u2019Reyly, his son and heir has reached his maturity and now holds the land from the king in free and common socage. Catherine Newgent, alias Reily, was the wife of the said Edmund and the aforesaid Catherine is dower of the premises.'' Whether Carrick originally formed part of the 1611 grant to Mulmore O'Reilly is unclear. The O'Reillys may have purchased it later as Edmund was the owner in 1637. It then seems to have been sold to the Graham family of Bawnboy as an Inquisition held at [[Belturbet]] on 12 June 1661 found that- ''{{lang|en-emodeng|George Graham, a knight, deceased, in his lifetime was seised as of fee off the town and land of '''Carrigg''', Gosnefrehane and Ballyoghnemoynagh, with several other parcels of land lying in Co. Cavan, containing by estimation 200 acres and with a yearly value, over and above reprises, of \u00a35 sterling. Being seised of such an estate, the aforesaid George by his last will made on 1 May 1615 by and in consideration of his natural affection for William Graham, the younger son of said George, gave the aforesaid town and land with appurtenances to the same William Graham, to his heirs and assigns in perpeuity. The aforesaid William Graham after his father's death, was seised and possessed of these premises by virtue of the said last will, by which the premises were held or are held now without knowledge of the law.}}''<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WUepqE-K4PAC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=Ballyoghnemoynagh&source=bl&ots=q1rxOgZ3Tf&sig=ACfU3U1phE7gd0ttirxCAY1cnUPBJ_F2ZQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjlkb7sg-ToAhUpTxUIHbLrDRwQ6AEwBHoECAsQMQ#v=onepage&q=Ballyoghnemoynagh&f=false]</ref> This seems to imply that Carrick belonged to George Graham in 1615 not the O'Reillys, however it may have been an error made by the 1661 Inquisition as an earlier Inquisition held at [[Cavan]] on 31 October 1627 found that- ''George Greames was seised as of fee, of 20 polls of land in Co. Cavan and he died 9 October 1624.
