He was the most celebrated violin [[virtuoso]] of his time, and left his mark as one of the pillars of modern violin technique. His [[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|24 Caprices for Solo Violin Op. 1]] are among the best known of his compositions, and have served as an inspiration for many prominent composers.\n[[File:Paganinis all six violin concertos Nikolay Madoyan Conductor Karen Durgaryan camera recording from hall Armenian National Academic Theater Symphonic Orchestra - Paganini's Cantabile.webm|thumb|Paganini: all six violin concertos]]\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Niccol\u00f2 Paganini ritratto giovanile.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of young Paganini]]\n\n===Childhood===\nNiccol\u00f2 Paganini was born in [[Genoa]], then capital of the [[Republic of Genoa]], the third of the six children of Antonio and Teresa (n\u00e9e Bocciardo) Paganini. Paganini's father was an unsuccessful trader, but he managed to supplement his income through playing music on the [[mandolin]]. At the age of five, Paganini started learning the mandolin from his father, and moved to the violin by the age of seven. His musical talents were quickly recognized, earning him numerous scholarships for violin lessons. The young Paganini studied under various local violinists, including Giovanni Servetto and Giacomo Costa, but his progress quickly outpaced their abilities. Paganini and his father then traveled to [[Parma]] to seek further guidance from [[Alessandro Rolla]]. But upon listening to Paganini's playing, Rolla immediately referred him to his own teacher, [[Ferdinando Paer]] and, later, Paer's own teacher, [[Gasparo Ghiretti]]. Though Paganini did not stay long with Paer or Ghiretti, the two had considerable influence on his composition style.\n\n===Early career===\nThe French invaded northern Italy in March 1796, and Genoa was not spared. The Paganinis sought refuge in their country property in Romairone, near [[Bolzaneto]]. It was in this period that Paganini is thought to have developed his relationship with the guitar.<ref>J.J. Sugden: ''Paganini, his Life and Work'', p. 17. UK 1980</ref> He mastered the guitar, but preferred to play it in exclusively intimate, rather than public concerts.<ref>P.J. Bone: ''The Guitar and Mandolin''. Schotts, UK 1954</ref> He later described the guitar as his \"constant companion\" on his concert tours. By 1800, Paganini and his father traveled to [[Livorno]], where Paganini played in concerts and his father resumed his maritime work. In 1801, the 18-year-old Paganini was appointed first violin of the [[Republic of Lucca]], but a substantial portion of his income came from freelancing. His fame as a violinist was matched only by his reputation as a gambler and womanizer.\n\nIn 1805, Lucca was annexed by [[Napoleon]]ic France, and the region was ceded to Napoleon's sister, [[Elisa Bonaparte|Elisa Baciocchi]]. Paganini became a violinist for the Baciocchi court, while giving private lessons to Elisa's husband, [[Felice Pasquale Baciocchi|Felice]]. In 1807, Baciocchi became the [[Grand Duchess of Tuscany]] and her court was transferred to [[Florence]]. Paganini was part of the entourage, but, towards the end of 1809, he left Baciocchi to resume his freelance career.\n\n===Travelling virtuoso===\n[[File:Nicolo Paganini by Richard James Lane.jpg|thumb|upright|1831 bulletin advertising a performance of Paganini]]\nFor the next few years, Paganini returned to touring in the areas surrounding Parma and Genoa. Though he was very popular with the local audience, he was still not very well known in the rest of Europe. His first break came from an 1813 concert at [[La Scala]] in Milan. The concert was a great success. As a result, Paganini began to attract the attention of other prominent, though more conservative, musicians across Europe. His early encounters with [[Charles Philippe Lafont]] and [[Louis Spohr]] created intense rivalry. His concert activities, however, were still limited to Italy for the next few years.\n\nIn 1827, [[Pope Leo XII]] honoured Paganini with the [[Order of the Golden Spur]].<ref name=\"pd1900\">David, Paul. \"Paganini, Nicolo\", Grove (ed.) ''A Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' (1900), Vol. II, pp. 628\u2013632.</ref><ref>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' (1911), Vol. XX, p. 459, \"Paganini, Nicolo\".</ref> His fame spread across Europe with a concert tour that started in Vienna in August 1828, stopping in every major European city in Germany, Poland, and Bohemia until February 1831 in Strasbourg. This was followed by tours in Paris and Britain. His technical ability and his willingness to display it received much critical acclaim. In addition to his own compositions, theme and variations being the most popular, Paganini also performed modified versions of works (primarily concertos) written by his early contemporaries, such as [[Rodolphe Kreutzer]] and [[Giovanni Battista Viotti]].\n\nPaganini's travels also brought him into contact with eminent guitar virtuosi of the day, including [[Ferdinando Carulli]] in Paris and [[Mauro Giuliani]] in Vienna.<ref>Thomas F. Heck: ''Mauro Giuliani, a life for the Guitar'' (doctoral dissertation). GFA Reference, US 2013</ref> But this experience did not inspire him to play public concerts with guitar, and even performances of his own guitar trios and quartets were private to the point of being behind closed doors.\n\n===Late career and health decline===\nThroughout his life, Paganini was a stranger to chronic illnesses. Although no definite medical proof exists, he was reputed to have been affected by [[Marfan syndrome]]<ref>{{cite journal|first=Myron R.|last=Schoenfeld|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/239/1/40|title=Nicolo Paganini \u2013 Musical Magician and Marfan Mutant?|date=January 2, 1978|volume=239|number=1|pages=40\u201342|journal=[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]|pmid=336919|accessdate=12 November 2011|doi=10.1001/jama.239.1.40}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.violinist.com/discussion/response.cfm?ID=13135 |title=Paganini's left hand |publisher=Violinist.com |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> or [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11694491 | volume=175 | issue=5 | title=Creativity and chronic disease.

He was diagnosed with [[syphilis]] as early as 1822, and his remedy, which included [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[opium]], came with serious physical and psychological side effects. In 1834, while still in Paris, he was treated for [[tuberculosis]]. Though his recovery was reasonably quick, after the illness his career was marred by frequent cancellations due to various health problems, from the common cold to depression, which lasted from days to months.\n\nIn September 1834, Paganini put an end to his concert career and returned to Genoa. Contrary to popular beliefs involving his wishing to keep his music and techniques secret, Paganini devoted his time to the publication of his compositions and violin methods. He accepted students, of whom two enjoyed moderate success: violinist [[Camillo Sivori]] and cellist Gaetano Ciandelli. Neither, however, considered Paganini helpful or inspirational. In 1835, Paganini returned to Parma, this time under the employ of [[Archduchess]] [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]] of Austria, Napoleon's second wife. He was in charge of reorganizing her court orchestra. However, he eventually conflicted with the players and court, so his visions never saw completion. In Paris, he befriended the 11-year-old Polish virtuoso [[Apollinaire de Kontski]], giving him some lessons and a signed testimonial. It was widely put about, falsely, that Paganini was so impressed with de Kontski's skills that he bequeathed him his violins and manuscripts.\n\n===Final years, death, and burial===\n[[File:Paganinitomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Paganini in [[Parma]], Italy]]\nIn 1836, Paganini returned to Paris to set up a casino. Its immediate failure left him in financial ruin, and he auctioned off his personal effects, including his musical instruments, to recoup his losses. At Christmas of 1838, he left Paris for Marseilles and, after a brief stay, travelled to Nice where his condition worsened. In May 1840, the Bishop of Nice sent Paganini a local parish priest to perform the [[last rites]]. Paganini assumed the sacrament was premature, and refused.<ref name=\"pd1900\" />\n\nA week later, on 27 May 1840, Paganini died from internal hemorrhaging before a priest could be summoned. Because of this, and his widely rumored association with the devil, the Church denied his body a Catholic burial in Genoa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} It took four years and an appeal to the Pope before the Church let his body be transported to Genoa, but it was still not buried. His body was finally buried in 1876, in a cemetery in Parma. In 1893, the Czech violinist [[Franti\u0161ek Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek]] persuaded Paganini's grandson, Attila, to allow a viewing of the violinist's body. After this episode, Paganini's body was finally reinterred in a new cemetery in Parma in 1896.\n\n===Personal and professional relationships===\nThough having no shortage of romantic conquests, Paganini was seriously involved with a singer named Antonia Bianchi from Como, whom he met in Milan in 1813. The two gave concerts together throughout Italy. They had a son, Achille Ciro Alessandro, born on 23 July 1825 in Palermo and baptized at San Bartolomeo's. They never legalized their union and it ended around April 1828 in Vienna. Paganini brought Achille on his European tours, and Achille later accompanied his father until the latter's death. He was instrumental in dealing with his father's burial, years after his death.\n\nThroughout his career, Paganini also became close friends with composers [[Gioachino Rossini]] and [[Hector Berlioz]]. Rossini and Paganini met in Bologna in the summer of 1818. In January 1821, on his return from Naples, Paganini met Rossini again in Rome, just in time to become the substitute conductor for Rossini's opera ''[[Matilde di Shabran]]'', upon the sudden death of the original conductor. Paganini's efforts earned gratitude from Rossini.\n\nPaganini met Berlioz in Paris, and was a frequent correspondent as a penfriend. He commissioned a piece from the composer, but was not satisfied with the resultant four-movement piece for orchestra and viola obbligato ''[[Harold en Italie]]''. He never performed it, and instead it was premiered a year later by violist [[Chr\u00e9tien Urhan|Christian Urhan]]. He did however write his own ''Sonata per Gran Viola'' Op. 35 (with orchestra or guitar accompaniment). Despite his alleged lack of interest in ''Harold'', Paganini often referred to Berlioz as the resurrection of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and, towards the end of his life, he gave large sums to the composer. They shared an active interest in the guitar, which they both played and used in compositions. Paganini gave Berlioz a guitar, which they both signed on its [[sound box]].\n\n===Instruments===\n[[File:Strad-hubay-view.jpg|thumb|Views of the ''Hubay'' 1726 [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]]]]\nPaganini was in possession of a number of fine stringed instruments. More legendary than these were the circumstances under which he obtained (and lost) some of them. While Paganini was still a teenager in [[Livorno]], a wealthy businessman named Livron lent him a violin, made by the master luthier [[Giuseppe Guarneri]], for a concert. Livron was so impressed with Paganini's playing that he refused to take it back. This particular violin came to be known as ''[[Il Cannone Guarnerius]]''.<ref name=\"Menuhin\">Yehudi Menuhin and Curtis W. Davis. ''The Music of Man''. Methuen, 1979.</ref> On a later occasion in Parma, he won another valuable violin (also by Guarneri) after a difficult sight-reading challenge from a man named Pasini.\n\n[[File:Bartolomeo giuseppe guarneri, violino cannone, appartenuto a niccol\u00f2 paganini, cremona 1743.JPG|left|thumb|upright|''[[Il Cannone Guarnerius]]'' on exhibit at the [[Palazzo Doria-Tursi]] in Genoa, Italy]]\nOther instruments associated with Paganini include the ''Antonio [[Amati]]'' 1600, the ''[[Nicol\u00f2 Amati]]'' 1657, the ''[[List of Stradivarius instruments|Paganini-Desaint]]'' 1680 [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]], the [[Giuseppe Giovanni Battista Guarneri|Guarneri-filius]] ''Andrea'' 1706, the ''[[Le Brun Stradivarius|Le Brun]]'' 1712 Stradivari, the ''[[Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume|Vuillaume]]'' c.&nbsp;1720 [[Carlo Bergonzi (luthier)|Bergonzi]], the ''Hubay'' 1726 Stradivari, and the ''Comte&nbsp;Cozio di Salabue'' 1727 violins; the ''Countess of Flanders'' 1582 [[Gasparo da Sal\u00f2|da&nbsp;Sal\u00f2-di&nbsp;Bertolotti]], and the ''Mendelssohn'' 1731 Stradivari violas; the ''Piatti'' 1700 [[Matteo Goffriller|Goffriller]], the ''Stanlein'' 1707 Stradivari, and the ''Ladenburg'' 1736 Stradivari cellos; and the ''Grobert of Mirecourt'' 1820 (guitar).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediatheque.cite-musique.fr/ClientBookLineCIMU/recherche/NoticeDetailleByID.asp?ID=0161650 |title=Mediatheque.cite |publisher=Mediatheque.cite-musique.fr |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://boulevarddesresistants.hautetfort.com/archive/2008/01/23/histoire-d-une-guitare-romantique.html |title=Hautetfort.com |publisher=Boulevarddesresistants.hautetfort.com |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> Four of these instruments were played by the [[Tokyo String Quartet]].\n\nOf his guitars, there is little evidence remaining of his various choices of instrument. The aforementioned guitar that he gave to Berlioz is a French instrument made by one Grobert of [[Mirecourt]]. The luthier made his instrument in the style of [[Ren\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Lac\u00f4te|Ren\u00e9 Lac\u00f4te]], a more well-known Paris-based guitar-maker. It is preserved and on display in the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Musique]] in Paris.\n\nOf the guitars he owned through his life, there was an instrument by Gennaro Fabricatore that he had refused to sell even in his periods of financial stress, and was among the instruments in his possession at the time of his death. There is an unsubstantiated rumour that he also played [[Johann Georg Stauffer|Stauffer]] guitars; he may certainly have come across these in his meetings with Giuliani in Vienna.\n\n==Compositions==\n{{listen|type=music|\n|filename=20091104 Joshua Bell and Sharon Isbin - Paganini's Cantabile.ogv\n|title=''Cantabile'' (Paganini)\n|description=[[Joshua Bell]] and [[Sharon Isbin]] perform Paganini's ''Cantabile'' at the [[White House]] Evening of Classical Music on 4 November 2009.\n|filename2=20091104 Joshua Bell and Sharon Isbin - Paganini's Cantabile.ogg\n|title2=''Cantabile'' (Paganini)\n|description2=Bell and Isbin \u2013 audio only version\n|filename3=CELLO ENCORES JOHN MICHEL-Paganini Variations on One String.ogg\n|title3=Variations on One String (Moses Fantasy)\n|description3=Performed by John Michell (cello) with a pianist}}\n{{Main|List of compositions by Niccol\u00f2 Paganini}}\nPaganini composed his own works to play exclusively in his concerts, all of which profoundly influenced the evolution of violin technique. His [[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|24 Caprices]] were likely composed in the period between 1805 and 1809, while he was in the service of the Baciocchi court. Also during this period, he composed the majority of the solo pieces, duo-sonatas, trios and quartets for the guitar, either as a solo instrument or with strings. These chamber works may have been inspired by the publication, in Lucca, of the guitar quintets of Boccherini. Many of his variations, including ''Le Streghe'', ''The Carnival of Venice'', and ''Nel cor pi\u00f9 non mi sento'', were composed, or at least first performed, before his European concert tour.\n\nGenerally speaking, Paganini's compositions were technically imaginative, and the [[timbre]] of the instrument was greatly expanded as a result of these works. Sounds of different musical instruments and animals were often imitated. One such composition was titled ''Il Fandango Spanolo'' (The Spanish Dance), which featured a series of humorous imitations of farm animals. Even more outrageous was a solo piece ''Duetto Amoroso'', in which the sighs and groans of lovers were intimately depicted on the violin. There survives a manuscript of the ''Duetto'', which has been recorded. The existence of the ''Fandango'' is known only through concert posters.\n\nHowever, his works were criticized for lacking characteristics of true polyphonism, as pointed out by [[Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe]].<ref>Lev Solomonovich Ginzburg. ''Ysaye''. Paganiniana, 1980.</ref> [[Yehudi Menuhin]], on the other hand, suggested that this might have been the result of his reliance on the guitar (in lieu of the piano) as an aid in composition.<ref name=\"Menuhin\" /> The orchestral parts for his concertos were often polite, unadventurous, and clearly supportive of the soloist. In this, his style is consistent with that of other Italian composers such as [[Giovanni Paisiello]], Gioachino Rossini and [[Gaetano Donizetti]], who were influenced by the guitar-song milieu of Naples during this period.<ref>N. Till: Rossini, pp. 50\u201351. Omnibus Press, 1987</ref>\n\nPaganini was also the inspiration of many prominent composers. Both \"La Campanella\" and the [[Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)|A&nbsp;minor Caprice (No.&nbsp;24)]] have been an object of interest for a number of composers. [[Franz Liszt]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Boris Blacher]], [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], [[George Rochberg]] and [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]], among others, wrote well-known variations on these themes.\n\n==Violin technique==\n[[File:David d'Angers - Paganini.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Bust of Niccol\u00f2 Paganini by [[David d'Angers]] (1830\u20131833)]]\nThe Israeli violinist [[Ivry Gitlis]] once referred to Paganini as a phenomenon rather than a development. Though some of the techniques frequently employed by Paganini were already present, most accomplished violinists of the time focused on intonation and bowing techniques. [[Arcangelo Corelli]] (1653\u20131713) was considered a pioneer in transforming the violin from an ensemble instrument to a solo instrument. In the meantime, the polyphonic capability of the violin was firmly established through the [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)|Sonatas and Partitas]] BWV 1001\u20131006 of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685\u20131750). Other notable violinists included [[Antonio Vivaldi]] (1678\u20131741) and [[Giuseppe Tartini]] (1692\u20131770), who, in their compositions, reflected the increasing technical and musical demands on the violinist. Although the role of the violin in music drastically changed through this period, progress in violin technique was steady but slow. Techniques requiring agility of the fingers and the bow were still considered unorthodox and discouraged by the established community of violinists.\n\nMuch of Paganini's playing (and his violin composition) was influenced by two violinists, [[Pietro Locatelli]] (1693\u20131746) and [[August Duranowski]] (Auguste Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Durand) (1770\u20131834). During Paganini's study in Parma, he came across the 24 Caprices of Locatelli (entitled ''L'arte di nuova modulazione \u2013 Capricci enigmatici'' or ''The art of the new style \u2013 the enigmatic caprices''). Published in the 1730s, they were shunned by the musical authorities for their technical innovations, and were forgotten by the musical community at large. Around the same time, Durand, a former student of [[Giovanni Battista Viotti]] (1755\u20131824), became a celebrated violinist. He was renowned for his use of harmonics, both natural and artificial (which had previously not been attempted in performance), and the left hand [[pizzicato]] in his performance.<ref>Richard Taruskin, ''An Oxford History of Western Music Volume 5: Music in the Nineteenth Century''. Oxford University Press, 2009</ref> Paganini was impressed by Durand's innovations and showmanship, which later also became the hallmarks of the young violin virtuoso. Paganini was instrumental in the revival and popularization of these violinistic techniques, which are now incorporated into regular compositions.\n\nAnother aspect of Paganini's violin techniques concerned his flexibility. He had exceptionally long fingers and was capable of playing three octaves across four strings in a hand span, an extraordinary feat even by today's standards. His seemingly unnatural ability may have been a result of [[Marfan syndrome]].<ref>From [http://tafkac.org/celebrities/paganini_stories_myths.html Paganini stories myths.] The AFU and Urban Legends Archive.

The series focuses on Paganini's relationship with the Roman Catholic Church. Another Soviet actor, [[Armen Dzhigarkhanyan]], played Paganini's fictionalized arch-rival, an insidious [[Jesuit]] official. The information in the series is generally spurious, and it also plays to some of the myths and legends rampant during the musician's lifetime. One memorable scene shows Paganini's adversaries sabotaging his violin before a high-profile performance, causing all strings but one to break during the concert. An undeterred Paganini continues to perform on three, two, and finally on a single string. In actuality, Paganini himself occasionally broke strings during his performances on purpose so he could further display his virtuosity.<ref>\"Paganini, Niccol\u00f2.\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite.'' Chicago: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2011.</ref> He did this by carefully filing notches into them to weaken them, so that they would break when in use.\n\nIn [[Don Nigro]]'s satirical comedy play ''Paganini'' (1995), the great violinist seeks vainly for his salvation, claiming that he unknowingly [[Deal with the Devil|sold his soul to the Devil]]. \"Variation upon variation,\" he cries at one point, \"but which variation leads to salvation and which to damnation? Music is a question for which there is no answer.\" Paganini is portrayed as having killed three of his lovers and sinking repeatedly into poverty, prison, and drink. Each time he is \"rescued\" by the Devil, who appears in different guises, returning Paganini's violin so he can continue playing. In the end, Paganini's salvation\u2014administered by a god-like Clockmaker\u2014turns out to be imprisonment in a large bottle where he plays his music for the amusement of the public through all eternity. \"Do not pity him, my dear,\" the Clockmaker tells Antonia, one of Paganini's murdered wives. \"He is alone with the answer for which there is no question. The saved and the damned are the same.\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Angelo Boscassi, ''Il Violino di Niccol\u00f2 Paganini conservato nel Palazzo Municipale di Genova'', Fratelli Pagano, 1909\n* Leopold Auer, ''Violin playing as I teach it'', Stokes, 1921 (reprint Dover, 1980)\n* Alberto Bachmann, ''An Encyclopedia of the violin'', Da Capo, 1925\n* Jeffrey Pulver, ''Paganini: The Romantic Virtuoso'', Herbert Joseph, 1936 (reprint Da Capo, 1970)\n* Geraldine I.C. de Courcy, ''Paganini the Genoese'', University of Oklahoma, 1957 (reprint Da Capo, 1977)\n* [[Yehudi Menuhin]] and [[William Primrose]], ''Violin and viola'', MacDonald and Jane's, 1976\n* Yehudi Menuhin and Curtis W.

He was the most celebrated violin [[virtuoso]] of his time, and left his mark as one of the pillars of modern violin technique. His [[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|24 Caprices for Solo Violin Op. 1]] are among the best known of his compositions, and have served as an inspiration for many prominent composers.\n[[File:Paganinis all six violin concertos Nikolay Madoyan Conductor Karen Durgaryan camera recording from hall Armenian National Academic Theater Symphonic Orchestra - Paganini's Cantabile.webm|thumb|Paganini: all six violin concertos]]\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Niccol\u00f2 Paganini ritratto giovanile.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of young Paganini]]\n\n===Childhood===\nNiccol\u00f2 Paganini was born in [[Genoa]], then capital of the [[Republic of Genoa]], the third of the six children of Antonio and Teresa (n\u00e9e Bocciardo) Paganini. Paganini's father was an unsuccessful trader, but he managed to supplement his income through playing music on the [[mandolin]]. At the age of five, Paganini started learning the mandolin from his father, and moved to the violin by the age of seven. His musical talents were quickly recognized, earning him numerous scholarships for violin lessons. The young Paganini studied under various local violinists, including Giovanni Servetto and Giacomo Costa, but his progress quickly outpaced their abilities. Paganini and his father then traveled to [[Parma]] to seek further guidance from [[Alessandro Rolla]]. But upon listening to Paganini's playing, Rolla immediately referred him to his own teacher, [[Ferdinando Paer]] and, later, Paer's own teacher, [[Gasparo Ghiretti]]. Though Paganini did not stay long with Paer or Ghiretti, the two had considerable influence on his composition style.\n\n===Early career===\nThe French invaded northern Italy in March 1796, and Genoa was not spared. The Paganinis sought refuge in their country property in Romairone, near [[Bolzaneto]]. It was in this period that Paganini is thought to have developed his relationship with the guitar.<ref>J.J. Sugden: ''Paganini, his Life and Work'', p. 17. UK 1980</ref> He mastered the guitar, but preferred to play it in exclusively intimate, rather than public concerts.<ref>P.J. Bone: ''The Guitar and Mandolin''. Schotts, UK 1954</ref> He later described the guitar as his \"constant companion\" on his concert tours. By 1800, Paganini and his father traveled to [[Livorno]], where Paganini played in concerts and his father resumed his maritime work. In 1801, the 18-year-old Paganini was appointed first violin of the [[Republic of Lucca]], but a substantial portion of his income came from freelancing. His fame as a violinist was matched only by his reputation as a gambler and womanizer.\n\nIn 1805, Lucca was annexed by [[Napoleon]]ic France, and the region was ceded to Napoleon's sister, [[Elisa Bonaparte|Elisa Baciocchi]]. Paganini became a violinist for the Baciocchi court, while giving private lessons to Elisa's husband, [[Felice Pasquale Baciocchi|Felice]]. In 1807, Baciocchi became the [[Grand Duchess of Tuscany]] and her court was transferred to [[Florence]]. Paganini was part of the entourage, but, towards the end of 1809, he left Baciocchi to resume his freelance career.\n\n===Travelling virtuoso===\n[[File:Nicolo Paganini by Richard James Lane.jpg|thumb|upright|1831 bulletin advertising a performance of Paganini]]\nFor the next few years, Paganini returned to touring in the areas surrounding Parma and Genoa. Though he was very popular with the local audience, he was still not very well known in the rest of Europe. His first break came from an 1813 concert at [[La Scala]] in Milan. The concert was a great success. As a result, Paganini began to attract the attention of other prominent, though more conservative, musicians across Europe. His early encounters with [[Charles Philippe Lafont]] and [[Louis Spohr]] created intense rivalry. His concert activities, however, were still limited to Italy for the next few years.\n\nIn 1827, [[Pope Leo XII]] honoured Paganini with the [[Order of the Golden Spur]].<ref name=\"pd1900\">David, Paul. \"Paganini, Nicolo\", Grove (ed.) ''A Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' (1900), Vol. II, pp. 628\u2013632.</ref><ref>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' (1911), Vol. XX, p. 459, \"Paganini, Nicolo\".</ref> His fame spread across Europe with a concert tour that started in Vienna in August 1828, stopping in every major European city in Germany, Poland, and Bohemia until February 1831 in Strasbourg. This was followed by tours in Paris and Britain. His technical ability and his willingness to display it received much critical acclaim. In addition to his own compositions, theme and variations being the most popular, Paganini also performed modified versions of works (primarily concertos) written by his early contemporaries, such as [[Rodolphe Kreutzer]] and [[Giovanni Battista Viotti]].\n\nPaganini's travels also brought him into contact with eminent guitar virtuosi of the day, including [[Ferdinando Carulli]] in Paris and [[Mauro Giuliani]] in Vienna.<ref>Thomas F. Heck: ''Mauro Giuliani, a life for the Guitar'' (doctoral dissertation). GFA Reference, US 2013</ref> But this experience did not inspire him to play public concerts with guitar, and even performances of his own guitar trios and quartets were private to the point of being behind closed doors.\n\n===Late career and health decline===\nThroughout his life, Paganini was no stranger to chronic illnesses. Although no definite medical proof exists, he was reputed to have been affected by [[Marfan syndrome]]<ref>{{cite journal|first=Myron R.|last=Schoenfeld|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/239/1/40|title=Nicolo Paganini \u2013 Musical Magician and Marfan Mutant?|date=January 2, 1978|volume=239|number=1|pages=40\u201342|journal=[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]|pmid=336919|accessdate=12 November 2011|doi=10.1001/jama.239.1.40}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.violinist.com/discussion/response.cfm?ID=13135 |title=Paganini's left hand |publisher=Violinist.com |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> or [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11694491 | volume=175 | issue=5 | title=Creativity and chronic disease.

He was diagnosed with [[syphilis]] as early as 1822, and his remedy, which included [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[opium]], came with serious physical and psychological side effects. In 1834, while still in Paris, he was treated for [[tuberculosis]]. Though his recovery was reasonably quick, after the illness his career was marred by frequent cancellations due to various health problems, from the common cold to depression, which lasted from days to months.\n\nIn September 1834, Paganini put an end to his concert career and returned to Genoa. Contrary to popular beliefs involving his wishing to keep his music and techniques secret, Paganini devoted his time to the publication of his compositions and violin methods. He accepted students, of whom two enjoyed moderate success: violinist [[Camillo Sivori]] and cellist Gaetano Ciandelli. Neither, however, considered Paganini helpful or inspirational. In 1835, Paganini returned to Parma, this time under the employ of [[Archduchess]] [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]] of Austria, Napoleon's second wife. He was in charge of reorganizing her court orchestra. However, he eventually conflicted with the players and court, so his visions never saw completion. In Paris, he befriended the 11-year-old Polish virtuoso [[Apollinaire de Kontski]], giving him some lessons and a signed testimonial. It was widely put about, falsely, that Paganini was so impressed with de Kontski's skills that he bequeathed him his violins and manuscripts.\n\n===Final years, death, and burial===\n[[File:Paganinitomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Paganini in [[Parma]], Italy]]\nIn 1836, Paganini returned to Paris to set up a casino. Its immediate failure left him in financial ruin, and he auctioned off his personal effects, including his musical instruments, to recoup his losses. At Christmas of 1838, he left Paris for Marseilles and, after a brief stay, travelled to Nice where his condition worsened. In May 1840, the Bishop of Nice sent Paganini a local parish priest to perform the [[last rites]]. Paganini assumed the sacrament was premature, and refused.<ref name=\"pd1900\" />\n\nA week later, on 27 May 1840, Paganini died from internal hemorrhaging before a priest could be summoned. Because of this, and his widely rumored association with the devil, the Church denied his body a Catholic burial in Genoa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} It took four years and an appeal to the Pope before the Church let his body be transported to Genoa, but it was still not buried. His body was finally buried in 1876, in a cemetery in Parma. In 1893, the Czech violinist [[Franti\u0161ek Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek]] persuaded Paganini's grandson, Attila, to allow a viewing of the violinist's body. After this episode, Paganini's body was finally reinterred in a new cemetery in Parma in 1896.\n\n===Personal and professional relationships===\nThough having no shortage of romantic conquests, Paganini was seriously involved with a singer named Antonia Bianchi from Como, whom he met in Milan in 1813. The two gave concerts together throughout Italy. They had a son, Achille Ciro Alessandro, born on 23 July 1825 in Palermo and baptized at San Bartolomeo's. They never legalized their union and it ended around April 1828 in Vienna. Paganini brought Achille on his European tours, and Achille later accompanied his father until the latter's death. He was instrumental in dealing with his father's burial, years after his death.\n\nThroughout his career, Paganini also became close friends with composers [[Gioachino Rossini]] and [[Hector Berlioz]]. Rossini and Paganini met in Bologna in the summer of 1818. In January 1821, on his return from Naples, Paganini met Rossini again in Rome, just in time to become the substitute conductor for Rossini's opera ''[[Matilde di Shabran]]'', upon the sudden death of the original conductor. Paganini's efforts earned gratitude from Rossini.\n\nPaganini met Berlioz in Paris, and was a frequent correspondent as a penfriend. He commissioned a piece from the composer, but was not satisfied with the resultant four-movement piece for orchestra and viola obbligato ''[[Harold en Italie]]''. He never performed it, and instead it was premiered a year later by violist [[Chr\u00e9tien Urhan|Christian Urhan]]. He did however write his own ''Sonata per Gran Viola'' Op. 35 (with orchestra or guitar accompaniment). Despite his alleged lack of interest in ''Harold'', Paganini often referred to Berlioz as the resurrection of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and, towards the end of his life, he gave large sums to the composer. They shared an active interest in the guitar, which they both played and used in compositions. Paganini gave Berlioz a guitar, which they both signed on its [[sound box]].\n\n===Instruments===\n[[File:Strad-hubay-view.jpg|thumb|Views of the ''Hubay'' 1726 [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]]]]\nPaganini was in possession of a number of fine stringed instruments. More legendary than these were the circumstances under which he obtained (and lost) some of them. While Paganini was still a teenager in [[Livorno]], a wealthy businessman named Livron lent him a violin, made by the master luthier [[Giuseppe Guarneri]], for a concert. Livron was so impressed with Paganini's playing that he refused to take it back. This particular violin came to be known as ''[[Il Cannone Guarnerius]]''.<ref name=\"Menuhin\">Yehudi Menuhin and Curtis W. Davis. ''The Music of Man''. Methuen, 1979.</ref> On a later occasion in Parma, he won another valuable violin (also by Guarneri) after a difficult sight-reading challenge from a man named Pasini.\n\n[[File:Bartolomeo giuseppe guarneri, violino cannone, appartenuto a niccol\u00f2 paganini, cremona 1743.JPG|left|thumb|upright|''[[Il Cannone Guarnerius]]'' on exhibit at the [[Palazzo Doria-Tursi]] in Genoa, Italy]]\nOther instruments associated with Paganini include the ''Antonio [[Amati]]'' 1600, the ''[[Nicol\u00f2 Amati]]'' 1657, the ''[[List of Stradivarius instruments|Paganini-Desaint]]'' 1680 [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]], the [[Giuseppe Giovanni Battista Guarneri|Guarneri-filius]] ''Andrea'' 1706, the ''[[Le Brun Stradivarius|Le Brun]]'' 1712 Stradivari, the ''[[Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume|Vuillaume]]'' c.&nbsp;1720 [[Carlo Bergonzi (luthier)|Bergonzi]], the ''Hubay'' 1726 Stradivari, and the ''Comte&nbsp;Cozio di Salabue'' 1727 violins; the ''Countess of Flanders'' 1582 [[Gasparo da Sal\u00f2|da&nbsp;Sal\u00f2-di&nbsp;Bertolotti]], and the ''Mendelssohn'' 1731 Stradivari violas; the ''Piatti'' 1700 [[Matteo Goffriller|Goffriller]], the ''Stanlein'' 1707 Stradivari, and the ''Ladenburg'' 1736 Stradivari cellos; and the ''Grobert of Mirecourt'' 1820 (guitar).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediatheque.cite-musique.fr/ClientBookLineCIMU/recherche/NoticeDetailleByID.asp?ID=0161650 |title=Mediatheque.cite |publisher=Mediatheque.cite-musique.fr |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://boulevarddesresistants.hautetfort.com/archive/2008/01/23/histoire-d-une-guitare-romantique.html |title=Hautetfort.com |publisher=Boulevarddesresistants.hautetfort.com |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> Four of these instruments were played by the [[Tokyo String Quartet]].\n\nOf his guitars, there is little evidence remaining of his various choices of instrument. The aforementioned guitar that he gave to Berlioz is a French instrument made by one Grobert of [[Mirecourt]]. The luthier made his instrument in the style of [[Ren\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Lac\u00f4te|Ren\u00e9 Lac\u00f4te]], a more well-known Paris-based guitar-maker. It is preserved and on display in the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Musique]] in Paris.\n\nOf the guitars he owned through his life, there was an instrument by Gennaro Fabricatore that he had refused to sell even in his periods of financial stress, and was among the instruments in his possession at the time of his death. There is an unsubstantiated rumour that he also played [[Johann Georg Stauffer|Stauffer]] guitars; he may certainly have come across these in his meetings with Giuliani in Vienna.\n\n==Compositions==\n{{listen|type=music|\n|filename=20091104 Joshua Bell and Sharon Isbin - Paganini's Cantabile.ogv\n|title=''Cantabile'' (Paganini)\n|description=[[Joshua Bell]] and [[Sharon Isbin]] perform Paganini's ''Cantabile'' at the [[White House]] Evening of Classical Music on 4 November 2009.\n|filename2=20091104 Joshua Bell and Sharon Isbin - Paganini's Cantabile.ogg\n|title2=''Cantabile'' (Paganini)\n|description2=Bell and Isbin \u2013 audio only version\n|filename3=CELLO ENCORES JOHN MICHEL-Paganini Variations on One String.ogg\n|title3=Variations on One String (Moses Fantasy)\n|description3=Performed by John Michell (cello) with a pianist}}\n{{Main|List of compositions by Niccol\u00f2 Paganini}}\nPaganini composed his own works to play exclusively in his concerts, all of which profoundly influenced the evolution of violin technique. His [[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|24 Caprices]] were likely composed in the period between 1805 and 1809, while he was in the service of the Baciocchi court. Also during this period, he composed the majority of the solo pieces, duo-sonatas, trios and quartets for the guitar, either as a solo instrument or with strings. These chamber works may have been inspired by the publication, in Lucca, of the guitar quintets of Boccherini. Many of his variations, including ''Le Streghe'', ''The Carnival of Venice'', and ''Nel cor pi\u00f9 non mi sento'', were composed, or at least first performed, before his European concert tour.\n\nGenerally speaking, Paganini's compositions were technically imaginative, and the [[timbre]] of the instrument was greatly expanded as a result of these works. Sounds of different musical instruments and animals were often imitated. One such composition was titled ''Il Fandango Spanolo'' (The Spanish Dance), which featured a series of humorous imitations of farm animals. Even more outrageous was a solo piece ''Duetto Amoroso'', in which the sighs and groans of lovers were intimately depicted on the violin. There survives a manuscript of the ''Duetto'', which has been recorded. The existence of the ''Fandango'' is known only through concert posters.\n\nHowever, his works were criticized for lacking characteristics of true polyphonism, as pointed out by [[Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe]].<ref>Lev Solomonovich Ginzburg. ''Ysaye''. Paganiniana, 1980.</ref> [[Yehudi Menuhin]], on the other hand, suggested that this might have been the result of his reliance on the guitar (in lieu of the piano) as an aid in composition.<ref name=\"Menuhin\" /> The orchestral parts for his concertos were often polite, unadventurous, and clearly supportive of the soloist. In this, his style is consistent with that of other Italian composers such as [[Giovanni Paisiello]], Gioachino Rossini and [[Gaetano Donizetti]], who were influenced by the guitar-song milieu of Naples during this period.<ref>N. Till: Rossini, pp. 50\u201351. Omnibus Press, 1987</ref>\n\nPaganini was also the inspiration of many prominent composers. Both \"La Campanella\" and the [[Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)|A&nbsp;minor Caprice (No.&nbsp;24)]] have been an object of interest for a number of composers. [[Franz Liszt]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Boris Blacher]], [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], [[George Rochberg]] and [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]], among others, wrote well-known variations on these themes.\n\n==Violin technique==\n[[File:David d'Angers - Paganini.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Bust of Niccol\u00f2 Paganini by [[David d'Angers]] (1830\u20131833)]]\nThe Israeli violinist [[Ivry Gitlis]] once referred to Paganini as a phenomenon rather than a development. Though some of the techniques frequently employed by Paganini were already present, most accomplished violinists of the time focused on intonation and bowing techniques. [[Arcangelo Corelli]] (1653\u20131713) was considered a pioneer in transforming the violin from an ensemble instrument to a solo instrument. In the meantime, the polyphonic capability of the violin was firmly established through the [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)|Sonatas and Partitas]] BWV 1001\u20131006 of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685\u20131750). Other notable violinists included [[Antonio Vivaldi]] (1678\u20131741) and [[Giuseppe Tartini]] (1692\u20131770), who, in their compositions, reflected the increasing technical and musical demands on the violinist. Although the role of the violin in music drastically changed through this period, progress in violin technique was steady but slow. Techniques requiring agility of the fingers and the bow were still considered unorthodox and discouraged by the established community of violinists.\n\nMuch of Paganini's playing (and his violin composition) was influenced by two violinists, [[Pietro Locatelli]] (1693\u20131746) and [[August Duranowski]] (Auguste Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Durand) (1770\u20131834). During Paganini's study in Parma, he came across the 24 Caprices of Locatelli (entitled ''L'arte di nuova modulazione \u2013 Capricci enigmatici'' or ''The art of the new style \u2013 the enigmatic caprices''). Published in the 1730s, they were shunned by the musical authorities for their technical innovations, and were forgotten by the musical community at large. Around the same time, Durand, a former student of [[Giovanni Battista Viotti]] (1755\u20131824), became a celebrated violinist. He was renowned for his use of harmonics, both natural and artificial (which had previously not been attempted in performance), and the left hand [[pizzicato]] in his performance.<ref>Richard Taruskin, ''An Oxford History of Western Music Volume 5: Music in the Nineteenth Century''. Oxford University Press, 2009</ref> Paganini was impressed by Durand's innovations and showmanship, which later also became the hallmarks of the young violin virtuoso. Paganini was instrumental in the revival and popularization of these violinistic techniques, which are now incorporated into regular compositions.\n\nAnother aspect of Paganini's violin techniques concerned his flexibility. He had exceptionally long fingers and was capable of playing three octaves across four strings in a hand span, an extraordinary feat even by today's standards. His seemingly unnatural ability may have been a result of [[Marfan syndrome]].<ref>From [http://tafkac.org/celebrities/paganini_stories_myths.html Paganini stories myths.] The AFU and Urban Legends Archive.

The series focuses on Paganini's relationship with the Roman Catholic Church. Another Soviet actor, [[Armen Dzhigarkhanyan]], played Paganini's fictionalized arch-rival, an insidious [[Jesuit]] official. The information in the series is generally spurious, and it also plays to some of the myths and legends rampant during the musician's lifetime. One memorable scene shows Paganini's adversaries sabotaging his violin before a high-profile performance, causing all strings but one to break during the concert. An undeterred Paganini continues to perform on three, two, and finally on a single string. In actuality, Paganini himself occasionally broke strings during his performances on purpose so he could further display his virtuosity.<ref>\"Paganini, Niccol\u00f2.\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite.'' Chicago: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2011.</ref> He did this by carefully filing notches into them to weaken them, so that they would break when in use.\n\nIn [[Don Nigro]]'s satirical comedy play ''Paganini'' (1995), the great violinist seeks vainly for his salvation, claiming that he unknowingly [[Deal with the Devil|sold his soul to the Devil]]. \"Variation upon variation,\" he cries at one point, \"but which variation leads to salvation and which to damnation? Music is a question for which there is no answer.\" Paganini is portrayed as having killed three of his lovers and sinking repeatedly into poverty, prison, and drink. Each time he is \"rescued\" by the Devil, who appears in different guises, returning Paganini's violin so he can continue playing. In the end, Paganini's salvation\u2014administered by a god-like Clockmaker\u2014turns out to be imprisonment in a large bottle where he plays his music for the amusement of the public through all eternity. \"Do not pity him, my dear,\" the Clockmaker tells Antonia, one of Paganini's murdered wives. \"He is alone with the answer for which there is no question. The saved and the damned are the same.\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Angelo Boscassi, ''Il Violino di Niccol\u00f2 Paganini conservato nel Palazzo Municipale di Genova'', Fratelli Pagano, 1909\n* Leopold Auer, ''Violin playing as I teach it'', Stokes, 1921 (reprint Dover, 1980)\n* Alberto Bachmann, ''An Encyclopedia of the violin'', Da Capo, 1925\n* Jeffrey Pulver, ''Paganini: The Romantic Virtuoso'', Herbert Joseph, 1936 (reprint Da Capo, 1970)\n* Geraldine I.C. de Courcy, ''Paganini the Genoese'', University of Oklahoma, 1957 (reprint Da Capo, 1977)\n* [[Yehudi Menuhin]] and [[William Primrose]], ''Violin and viola'', MacDonald and Jane's, 1976\n* Yehudi Menuhin and Curtis W.
