The series was created and produced by several alum from ''[[Doctor Who]]''. Proposing that an adventurer born in 1867 had been revived from hibernation in 1966, ''Adam Adamant Lives!'' was a satirical look at life in the 1960s through the eyes of an Edwardian (Adamant vanished in 1902, when [[Edward VII]] had been on the throne just one year).\n\nIn 2020, Big Finish Productions reimagined the series as an audio drama.\n\n==Main Character==\nThe main character originally went through a number of possible names: \"Cornelius Chance\", \"Rupert De'Ath\", \"Dick Daring\", \"Dexter Noble\", \"Aurelian Winton\", \"Magnus Hawke\" and even \"Darius Crud\" before [[Sydney Newman]] settled on Adam Adamant, named after the generic mineral term [[adamant]]ine, which, since medieval times, has commonly referred to diamond. In the opening episode, \"A Vintage Year for Scoundrels\", Adam Llewellyn De Vere Adamant\u2014to give him his full name\u2014is a [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling]] Victorian [[gentleman]] adventurer who, in 1902, goes to rescue his kidnapped girlfriend Louise, but is lured into a trap whereupon he is captured and condemned to be frozen forever in a block of ice by his nemesis, the Face, whose identity is concealed behind a leather mask and who speaks in a sinister whispering voice. The Face grants his helpless prisoner one last request, and Adam asks to see Louise; but in his last moments of life before being frozen, Adam learns to his horror that Louise had faked her kidnapping and had been working for the Face all along.\n\nAdam is found in 1966, when a building is being knocked down, and he is revived. On emerging from a hospital and collapsing on the London streets, Adam is rescued by [[Georgina Jones]] and taken to her flat. Though in many ways a typical [[Swinging London|swinging sixties]] woman, Georgina had grown up idolising Adam through tales of his turn-of-the-century exploits. She tries to get in on all his cases, despite his efforts to stop her, and often manages to get a job at the scene in question at a moment's notice so she can interfere in the case. The part originally went to Ann Holloway in the untransmitted pilot episode, but was recast with [[Juliet Harmer]] as it was felt that Holloway's performance did not fit the series.\n\nAdam is an expert swordsman; he carries a [[swordstick]] and will cold-bloodedly kill any enemy who deserves it. He is not the only British hero with such a weapon; [[John Steed]] of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' had a sword umbrella, and [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] had a specially-made sword cane with a compass, which was also marked in inches so it could serve as a measuring tool.<ref>The TV series ''The Avengers'' and \"Whose Body?\" by Dorothy L Sayers{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}</ref> He was a Colonel and has been on the volunteer strength of the 51st Yeomanry since 1895 \u2013 though he is naturally listed on their official records as being \"missing, presumed killed\" since 1902. He is also a good boxer and occasionally demonstrates proficiency in [[jujitsu]], which had been introduced to England several years before he was frozen. Adam immediately became embroiled in the criminal world of the 1960s when Georgina was threatened after almost being witness to the murder of her grandfather by [[protection racket]]eers at a disco.\n\nThough there is no indication of where his money comes from or how he supports himself, Adam rebuilt his old home, the long demolished 26A Albany Street, on the top of a [[multi-storey car park]], which he had bought, at 17 Upper Thames Street in central London. It is accessed by a lift hidden on the other side of a sliding wall, activated from the outside by pressing a cleverly hidden call button. He also purchased a [[Mini Cooper S]] with the personalised numberplate ''AA 1000''. The car is dark green and tan (or perhaps dark brown and gold), it has a sun-roof, electric windows, and a very posh interior. It was a special conversion: a \"Mini de Ville\" by Harold Radford Coach Builder LTD.<ref name=mini>Mini Special about the car in the DVD{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}</ref> He occasionally does a job for the British Government, as in \"More Deadly Than the Sword\". When he is knocked unconscious, Adam usually dreams of how he was caught by the Face and of Louise telling him: \"So clever, but oh so vulnerable.\" This is apt, as many women take advantage of his Victorian na\u00efvet\u00e9.\n\nDuring the second episode, \"Death Has a Thousand Faces\", the events of which are set in [[Blackpool]], he acquires a manservant in the form of former music hall artiste and present [[Punch and Judy]] man William E. Simms. The character was originally to have been played by John Dawson, who hurt his back lifting an actress during rehearsals for \"The Sweet Smell of Disaster\" and was unable to continue; the part was recast, going instead to [[Jack May]]. In terms of fashion, the series captured well the gradual shift in 1966/67 from the \"mod\" styles of \"Swinging London\" to the more [[Bohemian style#Swinging London|Bohemian]] (eventually [[hippie]]) styles that characterised the late sixties. Adam has his 100th birthday in the final episode, \"A Sinister Sort of Service\", and gets a telegram from the Queen (a UK custom for people who have reached that age), as well as a birthday cake bearing one hundred candles.\n\nThe opening episode of Series 2, \"A Slight Case of Reincarnation\", apparently set in 1902, reminded viewers of the Face, who had not been seen since \"A Vintage Year for Scoundrels\"; his reappearance in the present day being explained in the next episode \"Black Echo\" by his having frozen himself back in 1902, with Louise (who, of course, aged naturally) watching over him during the years in between until the time came for him to be revived. The Face appeared in four more episodes during Series 2\u2014namely \"Face in a Mirror\", \"Tunnel of Death\", \"The Resurrectionists\" and \"A Sinister Sort of Service\"\u2014in which he would urge on the main villain(s) of each story, but while Adam would defeat the villain(s) on each occasion, the Face himself would never be captured or vanquished, always escaping to fight another day and vowing vengeance on Adam when they met next time.\n\nThough he didn't really need them, [[Gerald Harper]] wore false eyebrows based on the make-up lady's own eyebrows. He also wore a wig. Harper was a bit shortsighted and wore glasses, which he removed as soon as filming was ready to start. His shortsightedness did cause opponents to keep their distance in sword-fights since, as one actor put it, he could have inadvertently knocked their eye out. When the series ended, the make-up lady sewed the eyebrows onto a [[Sampler (needlework)|sampler]], with \"Here lie the Eyebrows of Adam Adamant, 1966\u20131967\" underneath, which was framed and given to Harper as a memento. Harper also kept Adam's swordstick, and both remain on his wall at home to this day.\n\n== Series creation ==\n''Adam Adamant Lives!'' has been called by modern observers \"what ''[[Doctor Who]]'' did next\",<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/adamant/intro.shtml BBC Cult's introduction to the show.</ref> because at least three ''Doctor Who'' alumni had key positions on the pilot. Most obviously, it reunited producer [[Verity Lambert]] with Head of Television Drama [[Sydney Newman]]. Together they had been at the core of decision-makers who launched ''Doctor Who''. But the series also brought [[Donald Cotton]], who had the same year written two serials for ''Doctor Who'', back into Newman's orbit. Cotton and partner [[Richard Harris (television writer)|Richard Harris]] would write the first script, \"A Vintage Year for Scoundrels\", and would thus come to be credited as co-creators.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0505194/fullcredits IMDB's crew sheet for the series' pilot.</ref><ref>http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/517661/index.html The British Film Institute's page on ''Adam Adamant Lives!''.</ref> Over the years, Newman has been cited as creator of the show. Even the BBC has at times propagated this idea, calling him the creator on some of their own pages devoted to the programme,<ref name=\"BBC Cult Trivia\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/adamant/trivia.shtml Trivia page at the BBC Cult pages on the programme.</ref> but not on others.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/mysciencefictionlife/A17345135 The BBC's ''Adam Adamant Lives!'' page at ''My Science Fiction Life''.</ref> In truth, he is probably more correctly seen as the executive producer or as having \"developed the series for television\". ''Adam Adamant Lives!'' was a quick replacement for the show he had actually intended, an adaptation of the adventures of literary detective [[Sexton Blake]]. When the rights to the character suddenly became unavailable, it fell to writers Donald Cotton and Richard Harris, along with [[script editor]] [[Tony Williamson (television writer)|Tony Williamson]], to come up with a replacement idea.<ref>http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/522017/index.html BFI article on Sydney Newman.</ref> Newman indicated near the end of his life that he had, indeed, been significantly involved in the rewrites, suggesting that his critic [[Mary Whitehouse]] had been partial inspiration for the character.<ref name=\"BBC Cult Trivia\"/> Like ''Doctor Who'' which had preceded it, ''Adam Adamant Lives!'' was thus a show created somewhat by committee and circumstance. Many of the indoor scenes were filmed at Studios 3 and 5 at the BBC Television Centre in London.\n\n==Cancellation==\nReasons for the cancellation of ''Adam Adamant Lives!'' vary according to the source. Television critic Paul Stump opines in \"The Cult of ... Adam Adamant!\" that the programme ended because ''The Avengers'' was a \"sexier, slicker, better-funded\" version of the same concept.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/reviews/2006/cultofadamadamant.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095641/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/reviews/2006/cultofadamadamant.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007  }} Stump, Paul.  \"The Cult of Adam Adamant Lives!\". offthetelly.co.uk. 14 November 2006.</ref> The programme's largest fan website counters by saying that Sydney Newman, as the BBC's Head of Television Drama, cancelled the show \"due to a difference of opinion between himself and his star\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ascendant-lee.mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/adamant/intro.htm |title=Experience days &#124; the UK's most awesome experiences |accessdate=31 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122801/http://ascendant-lee.mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/adamant/intro.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007  }} Rose, Lee.  \"Adam Adamant Lives!  2002/2006.</ref> An ''Avengers'' fansite agrees with both assessments. It says that the production values didn't match ''The Avengers'' and that despite good ratings \"Newman wasn't happy with the show overall, and the star in particular.\"<ref name=\"theavengers.tv\"/> ''Adam Adamant'' was one of several shows disowned by the BBC despite their popularity: other examples include the highly popular ''[[Paul Temple (TV series)|Paul Temple]]'' with [[Francis Matthews (actor)|Francis Matthews]] and [[Ros Drinkwater]], and Verity Lambert's later series ''[[Virtual Murder (TV series)|Virtual Murder]]'' with [[Nicholas Clay]] and [[Kim Thomson]].\n\n== Episode list ==\nThe untransmitted pilot episode, \"Adam Adamant Lives\", now no longer exists in the BBC Archives, and is believed to be lost.\n\nAll of Series One, with the exception of \"Ticket to Terror\", is held by the BBC.

The 1902 sequence is now all that is known to survive of this unseen debut episode of the series, and only exists because it was later reused in \"A Vintage Year for Scoundrels\". No script of ''Adam Adamant Lives'' is known to exist, and the only documentation that remains is the description given in the Drama Early Warning Synopsis issued on Thursday 10 March 1966; this is included in the booklet ''Adam Adamant Lives!: Viewing Notes'' accompanying the DVD boxed set ''Adam Adamant Lives!: The Complete Collection'' released by [[2entertain]] Ltd. in July 2006.\n\nThe first series, with the exception of \"Ticket to Terror\", was made as a mixture of single camera [[16 mm film|16mm film]] for the location sequences, and multi-camera studio recording using 625-line electronic cameras. However, instead of being edited on [[video tape]], as was the usual [[BBC]] procedure, the series was edited entirely on film, with the output of the studio cameras being [[telerecording|telerecorded]], for ease of editing (at that time, videotape editing was technologically difficult).\n\n\"Ticket to Terror\" from the first series, and all of the second series, were made with the usual BBC mix of tape and film, but were edited on tape. [[Wiping (magnetic tape)|Wiping]] by the BBC in the 1970s has resulted in no master videotapes having survived. Film recordings haven't all survived either as, in one case, one episode on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] is known to have been destroyed.\n\nThe result of all this is that only 16 episodes remained in the archives when the BBC realised the value of such material, including the first and last episodes in broadcast order. These were mainly in the form of 35mm film telerecordings, with a handful of episodes as 16mm film recordings or reduction prints. In the case of some episodes, the 35mm location footage also exists, and has been used to remaster those surviving episodes. The last episode of Series One, \"D For Destruction\", thought to be among those lost forever, was recovered in 2003, from a mislabelled film can in the BBC Archives. It has been shown in public at the [[Missing Believed Wiped]] event, and is included in the ''Complete Collection'' DVD set.\n\nAnother lost episode, \"The Basardi Affair\", was recovered as a complete audio recording in 2017.\n\nA public appeal campaign, the [[BBC Archive Treasure Hunt]], continues to search for missing episodes.\n\n===List of lost episodes===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Adam Adamant Lives!'', 2006}}\n\nThis latter view has been echoed by fans of ''The Avengers''. Indeed, an ''Avengers''-biased biography of ''Adamant'' star Gerald Harper, who also frequently guest-starred on the ITV show, flatly calls ''Adamant'' \"unashamedly modelled on ''The Avengers''\". It backs up this claim by demonstrating how individual episodes of ''Adamant'' parallel those of ''The Avengers''. Finally, it points out that in the programme's second series ''Adamant'' was scheduled in direct competition for ''Avengers'' in some parts of Britain, making contemporary comparison between the shows impossible for viewers.<ref name=\"theavengers.tv\">http://theavengers.tv/forever/pnote-harper.htm Stampede, Pete.  \"Gerald Harper\". theavengers.tv.</ref>\n\nMore neutral observers have generally reflected this dichotomy of perspective. Anthony Clark at the [[British Film Institute|BFI]] notes that while the show \"owes a stylistic debt to ''The Avengers''\", it was \"the BBC's reply to the success of ITV's spy and action series like ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'' (1962\u201369) and ''[[Danger Man]]'' (1960\u201369)\". He goes on to call the character of Adamant \"more age-of-empire adventurer than spoof spy\". A Television Haven review admits that while the programme has been \"long cited as the BBC's answer to ''The Avengers''\", it in fact \"owes more to the slick style, tone and format of [[Lew Grade]]'s phenomenally successful [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]] stable of action series rather than the sleek and sophisticated antics of Steed and Mrs Peel\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/adam.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808103351/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/adam.htm |archivedate=8 August 2007  }} Television Heaven's review of ''Adam Adamant Lives!''</ref>\n\nThe show's premise also bears more than a passing resemblance to the 1964 return of Captain America in Marvel Comics' (completely unrelated) ''The Avengers''. Both characters are adventurers from an earlier era who are thawed out of blocks of ice in the present day.\n\n===''Doctor Who''===\nHarper's portrayal of Adamant has been cited as formative to [[Jon Pertwee]]'s interpretation of [[Third Doctor|the Doctor]]. One writer opines that Pertwee's \"suave, dashing portrayal was very much surfing the ''[[zeitgeist]]'' of the time, borrowing from contemporaries such as ''Adam Adamant Lives!'', ''[[Doomwatch]]'', ''[[Quatermass]]'', and [[James Bond]] in the cinema.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/thebatgranny/pert.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204231/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/thebatgranny/pert.htm |archivedate=30 September 2007  }} The Hidden Planet's overview of the Jon Pertwee era on ''Doctor Who''.</ref> The BBC's episode guide to ''Doctor Who'' is more specific, claiming parallels between the Third Doctor's inaugural scenes in a hospital with those of Adamant in his pilot, \"A Vintage Year for Scoundrels\".<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/spearheadfromspace/detail.shtml \"Spearhead from Space\".

The series was created and produced by several alum from ''[[Doctor Who]]''. Proposing that an adventurer born in 1867 had been revived from hibernation in 1966, ''Adam Adamant Lives!'' was a satirical look at life in the 1960s through the eyes of an Edwardian (Adamant vanished in 1902, when [[Edward VII]] had been on the throne just one year).\n\nIn 2020, Big Finish Productions reimagined the series as an audio drama.\n==Main Character==\nThe main character originally went through a number of possible names: \"Cornelius Chance\", \"Rupert De'Ath\", \"Dick Daring\", \"Dexter Noble\", \"Aurelian Winton\", \"Magnus Hawke\" and even \"Darius Crud\" before [[Sydney Newman]] settled on Adam Adamant, named after the generic mineral term [[adamant]]ine, which, since medieval times, has commonly referred to diamond. In the opening episode, \"A Vintage Year for Scoundrels\", Adam Llewellyn De Vere Adamant\u2014to give him his full name\u2014is a [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling]] Victorian [[gentleman]] adventurer who, in 1902, goes to rescue his kidnapped girlfriend Louise, but is lured into a trap whereupon he is captured and condemned to be frozen forever in a block of ice by his nemesis, the Face, whose identity is concealed behind a leather mask and who speaks in a sinister whispering voice. The Face grants his helpless prisoner one last request, and Adam asks to see Louise; but in his last moments of life before being frozen, Adam learns to his horror that Louise had faked her kidnapping and had been working for the Face all along.\n\nAdam is found in 1966, when a building is being knocked down, and he is revived. On emerging from a hospital and collapsing on the London streets, Adam is rescued by [[Georgina Jones]] and taken to her flat. Though in many ways a typical [[Swinging London|swinging sixties]] woman, Georgina had grown up idolising Adam through tales of his turn-of-the-century exploits. She tries to get in on all his cases, despite his efforts to stop her, and often manages to get a job at the scene in question at a moment's notice so she can interfere in the case. The part originally went to Ann Holloway in the untransmitted pilot episode, but was recast with [[Juliet Harmer]] as it was felt that Holloway's performance did not fit the series.\n\nAdam is an expert swordsman; he carries a [[swordstick]] and will cold-bloodedly kill any enemy who deserves it. He is not the only British hero with such a weapon; [[John Steed]] of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' had a sword umbrella, and [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] had a specially-made sword cane with a compass, which was also marked in inches so it could serve as a measuring tool.<ref> The TV series ''The Avengers'' and \"Whose Body?\" by Dorothy L Sayers{{full|date=November 2017}}</ref> He was a Colonel and has been on the volunteer strength of the 51st Yeomanry since 1895 \u2013 though he is naturally listed on their official records as being \"missing, presumed killed\" since 1902. He is also a good boxer and occasionally demonstrates proficiency in [[jujitsu]], which had been introduced to England several years before he was frozen. Adam immediately became embroiled in the criminal world of the 1960s when Georgina was threatened after almost being witness to the murder of her grandfather by [[protection racket]]eers at a disco. \n\nThough there is no indication of where his money comes from or how he supports himself, Adam rebuilt his old home, the long demolished 26A Albany Street, on the top of a [[multi-storey car park]], which he had bought, at 17 Upper Thames Street in central London. It is accessed by a lift hidden on the other side of a sliding wall, activated from the outside by pressing a cleverly hidden call button. He also purchased a [[Mini Cooper S]] with the personalised numberplate ''AA 1000''. The car is dark green and tan (or perhaps dark brown and gold), it has a sun-roof, electric windows, and a very posh interior. It was a special conversion: a \"Mini de Ville\" by Harold Radford Coach Builder LTD.<ref name=mini>Mini Special about the car in the DVD{{full|date=November 2017}}</ref> He occasionally does a job for the British Government, as in \"More Deadly Than the Sword\". When he is knocked unconscious, Adam usually dreams of how he was caught by the Face and of Louise telling him: \"So clever, but oh so vulnerable.\" This is apt, as many women take advantage of his Victorian na\u00efvet\u00e9.\n\nDuring the second episode, \"Death Has a Thousand Faces\", the events of which are set in [[Blackpool]], he acquires a manservant in the form of former music hall artiste and present [[Punch and Judy]] man William E. Simms. The character was originally to have been played by John Dawson, who hurt his back lifting an actress during rehearsals for \"The Sweet Smell of Disaster\" and was unable to continue; the part was recast, going instead to [[Jack May]]. In terms of fashion, the series captured well the gradual shift in 1966/67 from the \"mod\" styles of \"Swinging London\" to the more [[Bohemian style#Swinging London|Bohemian]] (eventually [[hippie]]) styles that characterised the late sixties. Adam has his 100th birthday in the final episode, \"A Sinister Sort of Service\", and gets a telegram from the Queen (a UK custom for people who have reached that age), as well as a birthday cake bearing one hundred candles.\n\nThe opening episode of Series 2, \"A Slight Case of Reincarnation\", apparently set in 1902, reminded viewers of the Face, who had not been seen since \"A Vintage Year for Scoundrels\"; his reappearance in the present day being explained in the next episode \"Black Echo\" by his having frozen himself back in 1902, with Louise (who, of course, aged naturally) watching over him during the years in between until the time came for him to be revived. The Face appeared in four more episodes during Series 2\u2014namely \"Face in a Mirror\", \"Tunnel of Death\", \"The Resurrectionists\" and \"A Sinister Sort of Service\"\u2014in which he would urge on the main villain(s) of each story, but while Adam would defeat the villain(s) on each occasion, the Face himself would never be captured or vanquished, always escaping to fight another day and vowing vengeance on Adam when they met next time.\n\nThough he didn't really need them, [[Gerald Harper]] wore false eyebrows based on the make-up lady's own eyebrows. He also wore a wig. Harper was a bit shortsighted and wore glasses, which he removed as soon as filming was ready to start. His shortsightedness did cause opponents to keep their distance in sword-fights since, as one actor put it, he could have inadvertently knocked their eye out. When the series ended, the make-up lady sewed the eyebrows onto a [[Sampler (needlework)|sampler]], with \"Here lie the Eyebrows of Adam Adamant, 1966\u20131967\" underneath, which was framed and given to Harper as a memento. Harper also kept Adam's swordstick, and both remain on his wall at home to this day.\n\n== Series creation ==\n''Adam Adamant Lives!'' has been called by modern observers \"what ''[[Doctor Who]]'' did next\",<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/adamant/intro.shtml BBC Cult's introduction to the show.</ref> because at least three ''Doctor Who'' alumni had key positions on the pilot. Most obviously, it reunited producer [[Verity Lambert]] with Head of Television Drama [[Sydney Newman]]. Together they had been at the core of decision-makers who launched ''Doctor Who''. But the series also brought [[Donald Cotton]], who had the same year written two serials for ''Doctor Who'', back into Newman's orbit. Cotton and partner [[Richard Harris (television writer)|Richard Harris]] would write the first script, \"A Vintage Year for Scoundrels\", and would thus come to be credited as co-creators.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0505194/fullcredits IMDB's crew sheet for the series' pilot.</ref><ref>http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/517661/index.html The British Film Institute's page on ''Adam Adamant Lives!''.</ref> Over the years, Newman has been cited as creator of the show. Even the BBC has at times propagated this idea, calling him the creator on some of their own pages devoted to the programme,<ref name=\"BBC Cult Trivia\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/adamant/trivia.shtml Trivia page at the BBC Cult pages on the programme.</ref> but not on others.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/mysciencefictionlife/A17345135 The BBC's ''Adam Adamant Lives!'' page at ''My Science Fiction Life''.</ref> In truth, he is probably more correctly seen as the executive producer or as having \"developed the series for television\". ''Adam Adamant Lives!'' was a quick replacement for the show he had actually intended, an adaptation of the adventures of literary detective [[Sexton Blake]]. When the rights to the character suddenly became unavailable, it fell to writers Donald Cotton and Richard Harris, along with [[script editor]] [[Tony Williamson (television writer)|Tony Williamson]], to come up with a replacement idea.<ref>http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/522017/index.html BFI article on Sydney Newman.</ref> Newman indicated near the end of his life that he had, indeed, been significantly involved in the rewrites, suggesting that his critic [[Mary Whitehouse]] had been partial inspiration for the character.<ref name=\"BBC Cult Trivia\"/> Like ''Doctor Who'' which had preceded it, ''Adam Adamant Lives!'' was thus a show created somewhat by committee and circumstance. Many of the indoor scenes were filmed at Studios 3 and 5 at the BBC Television Centre in London.\n\n==Cancellation==\nReasons for the cancellation of ''Adam Adamant Lives!'' vary according to the source. Television critic Paul Stump opines in \"The Cult of ... Adam Adamant!\" that the programme ended because ''The Avengers'' was a \"sexier, slicker, better-funded\" version of the same concept.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/reviews/2006/cultofadamadamant.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095641/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/reviews/2006/cultofadamadamant.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007  }} Stump, Paul.  \"The Cult of Adam Adamant Lives!\". offthetelly.co.uk. 14 November 2006.</ref> The programme's largest fan website counters by saying that Sydney Newman, as the BBC's Head of Television Drama, cancelled the show \"due to a difference of opinion between himself and his star\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ascendant-lee.mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/adamant/intro.htm |title=Experience days &#124; the UK's most awesome experiences |accessdate=31 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122801/http://ascendant-lee.mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/adamant/intro.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007  }} Rose, Lee.  \"Adam Adamant Lives!  2002/2006.</ref> An ''Avengers'' fansite agrees with both assessments.

The 1902 sequence is now all that is known to survive of this unseen debut episode of the series, and only exists because it was later reused in \"A Vintage Year for Scoundrels\". No script of ''Adam Adamant Lives'' is known to exist, and the only documentation that remains is the description given in the Drama Early Warning Synopsis issued on Thursday 10 March 1966; this is included in the booklet ''Adam Adamant Lives!: Viewing Notes'' accompanying the DVD boxed set ''Adam Adamant Lives!: The Complete Collection'' released by [[2entertain]] Ltd. in July 2006.\n\nThe first series, with the exception of \"Ticket to Terror\", was made as a mixture of single camera [[16 mm film|16mm film]] for the location sequences, and multi-camera studio recording using 625-line electronic cameras. However, instead of being edited on [[video tape]], as was the usual [[BBC]] procedure, the series was edited entirely on film, with the output of the studio cameras being [[telerecording|telerecorded]], for ease of editing (at that time, videotape editing was technologically difficult).\n\n\"Ticket to Terror\" from the first series, and all of the second series, were made with the usual BBC mix of tape and film, but were edited on tape. [[Wiping (magnetic tape)|Wiping]] by the BBC in the 1970s has resulted in no master videotapes having survived. Film recordings haven't all survived either as, in one case, one episode on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] is known to have been destroyed.\n\nThe result of all this is that only 16 episodes remained in the archives when the BBC realised the value of such material, including the first and last episodes in broadcast order. These were mainly in the form of 35mm film telerecordings, with a handful of episodes as 16mm film recordings or reduction prints. In the case of some episodes, the 35mm location footage also exists, and has been used to remaster those surviving episodes. The last episode of Series One, \"D For Destruction\", thought to be among those lost forever, was recovered in 2003, from a mislabelled film can in the BBC Archives. It has been shown in public at the [[Missing Believed Wiped]] event, and is included in the ''Complete Collection'' DVD set.\n\nAnother lost episode, \"The Basardi Affair\", was recovered as a complete audio recording in 2017.\n\nA public appeal campaign, the [[BBC Archive Treasure Hunt]], continues to search for missing episodes.\n\n===List of lost episodes===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There was also a similarity with Granada's ''[[The Odd Man|Mr. Rose]]'' (1967) in which [[William Mervyn]] as a retired police inspector was assisted by a youngish confidential secretary ([[Gillian Lewis]]) and a manservant (Donald Webster). However, because ''Adam Adamant'' was a last-minute replacement for another concept, the degree to which the BBC intended such similarities with ''The Avengers'' is unclear. One recent statement has directly addressed the issue: {{Quote|In ''Adam Adamant Lives'', we were trying to create something original. Even though it may have been aimed at a similar audience to ''The Avengers'' \u2013 any production decisions we made were not influenced by trying to imitate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ascendant-lee.mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/adamant/lambert.htm |title=Experience days &#124; the UK's most awesome experiences |accessdate=2007-07-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122753/http://ascendant-lee.mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/adamant/lambert.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df=dmy }} A January 2004 written response to questions posed by fansite Adam Adamant Lives!: The Unofficial Homepage.</ref> |Verity Lambert, 2004|''programme producer''}} However, a reviewer of the 2006 [[BBC Four]] retrospective ''The Cult of ... Adam Adamant Lives!'' detected something more to the issue when Lambert and other principals were interviewed on camera: {{quote|The genial and personable Harmer, Clemens, Harper and producer Verity Lambert all owned up to the clunking obviousness of the series' hamfisted and, in retrospect, laughable attempt to trump [[Associated British Corporation|ABC]]'s masterpiece. Even an otherwise impartial and unironic script compared the two shows thus: \"Edwardian gent teamed with beautiful girl ... and Edwardian gent teamed with beautiful girl\". The unspoken tag, of course, was that ''The Avengers'' had queered this pitch three years previously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/reviews/2006/cultofadamadamant.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095641/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/reviews/2006/cultofadamadamant.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df=dmy }} Stump, Paul. \"The Cult of Adam Adamant Lives!\" offthetelly.co.uk. 14 November 2006.</ref>|Paul Stump|''Off the Telly'' review of ''The Cult of ... Adam Adamant Lives!'', 2006}}\n\nThis latter view has been echoed by fans of ''The Avengers''. Indeed, an ''Avengers''-biased biography of ''Adamant'' star Gerald Harper, who also frequently guest-starred on the ITV show, flatly calls ''Adamant'' \"unashamedly modelled on ''The Avengers''\". It backs up this claim by demonstrating how individual episodes of ''Adamant'' parallel those of ''The Avengers''. Finally, it points out that in the programme's second series ''Adamant'' was scheduled in direct competition for ''Avengers'' in some parts of Britain, making contemporary comparison between the shows impossible for viewers.<ref name=\"theavengers.tv\">http://theavengers.tv/forever/pnote-harper.htm Stampede, Pete.  \"Gerald Harper\". theavengers.tv.</ref>\n\nMore neutral observers have generally reflected this dichotomy of perspective. Anthony Clark at the [[British Film Institute|BFI]] notes that while the show \"owes a stylistic debt to ''The Avengers''\", it was \"the BBC's reply to the success of ITV's spy and action series like ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'' (1962\u201369) and ''[[Danger Man]]'' (1960\u201369)\". He goes on to call the character of Adamant \"more age-of-empire adventurer than spoof spy\". A Television Haven review admits that while the programme has been \"long cited as the BBC's answer to ''The Avengers''\", it in fact \"owes more to the slick style, tone and format of [[Lew Grade]]'s phenomenally successful [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]] stable of action series rather than the sleek and sophisticated antics of Steed and Mrs Peel\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/adam.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808103351/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/adam.htm |archivedate=8 August 2007  }} Television Heaven's review of ''Adam Adamant Lives!''</ref>\n\nThe show's premise also bears more than a passing resemblance to the 1964 return of Captain America in Marvel Comics' (completely unrelated) ''The Avengers''. Both characters are adventurers from an earlier era who are thawed out of blocks of ice in the present day.\n\n===''Doctor Who''===\nHarper's portrayal of Adamant has been cited as formative to [[Jon Pertwee]]'s interpretation of [[Third Doctor|the Doctor]]. One writer opines that Pertwee's \"suave, dashing portrayal was very much surfing the ''[[zeitgeist]]'' of the time, borrowing from contemporaries such as ''Adam Adamant Lives!'', ''[[Doomwatch]]'', ''[[Quatermass]]'', and [[James Bond]] in the cinema.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/thebatgranny/pert.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204231/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/thebatgranny/pert.htm |archivedate=30 September 2007  }} The Hidden Planet's overview of the Jon Pertwee era on ''Doctor Who''.</ref> The BBC's episode guide to ''Doctor Who'' is more specific, claiming parallels between the Third Doctor's inaugural scenes in a hospital with those of Adamant in his pilot, \"A Vintage Year for Scoundrels\".<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/spearheadfromspace/detail.shtml \"Spearhead from Space\".
