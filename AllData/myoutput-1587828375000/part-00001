In fact, in a colloquial or non-academic or non-linguist context, \u201cNeapolitan language\u201d, ''napulitano'', or ''napoletano'' generally refers specifically to the [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of the language spoken in [[Naples]] and the surrounding area; however, this variety is usually [[mutually intelligible]] with other related \u201cNeapolitan language\u201d varieties throughout Southern Italy.{{Citation needed |date=November 2019}}\n\n== Distribution ==\n[[File:WIKITONGUES- Foffo speaking Neapolitan.webm|thumb|A young man speaking Neapolitan.]]\nThe Neapolitan dialects are distributed throughout most of continental [[southern Italy]], historically united during the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], specifically southern [[Lazio]] ([[Gaeta]] and [[Sora, Lazio|Sora]] districts), southern [[Marche]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]], [[Basilicata]], [[Campania]] (Naples), northern and central [[Apulia]], and northernmost [[Calabria]]. The dialects are part of a varied [[dialect continuum]], so the varieties in southern Lazio, Marche, Abruzzo, Molise, Apulia, Lucania and Calabria can typically be recognizable as regional groups of dialects. In western Abruzzo and Lazio the dialects give way to [[Central Italian]] dialects such as [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]]. In central Calabria and southern Apulia, the dialects give way to the [[Sicilian language]]. Largely due to massive southern Italian migration in the late 19th century and early 20th century, there are also numbers of speakers in [[Italian diaspora]] communities in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela]]. However, in the [[United States]] traditional Neapolitan has had considerable contact with English, and is significantly different from contemporary Neapolitan spoken in [[Naples]]. English words are often used in place of Neapolitan words, especially among second-generation speakers. On the other hand, the effect on Neapolitan in Italy has been similar due to displacement by [[Italian language|Standard Italian]].\n\nThe following dialects constitute Neapolitan; numbers refer to the map:<ref>''[http://www.italica.rai.it/principali/lingua/bruni/mappe/flash/regionalok.htm Carta dei Dialetti d'Italia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003072247/http://www.italica.rai.it/principali/lingua/bruni/mappe/flash/regionalok.htm |date=3 October 2012 }}'' (Mapping of dialects of Italy) by Giovan Battista Pellegrini, 1977 (in [[Italian language|Italian]])</ref>\n\n{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-roman\n|Abruzzese and Southern Marchigiano:\n:Ia.

[http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/ital1286 \"Italo-Dalmatian\" Glottolog 2.3]. Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.</ref> There are notable differences among the various dialects, but they are all generally mutually intelligible.\n\n[[Italian language|Italian]] and Neapolitan are of variable mutual comprehensibility, depending on factors that are both affective and linguistic. There are notable grammatical differences, such as Neapolitan having nouns in the neuter form and a unique plural formation as well as historical phonological developments, which often obscure the cognacy of lexical items.\n\nIts evolution has been similar to that of Italian and other Romance languages from their roots in [[Vulgar Latin]]. It may reflect a pre-Latin [[Oscan language|Oscan]] [[Stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]], as in the pronunciation of the ''d'' sound as an ''r'' sound ([[rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]) at the beginning of a word or between two vowels: e.g. ''doje'' (feminine) or ''duje'' (masculine), meaning \"two\", is pronounced, and often spelled, as ''roje''/''ruje''; ''ved\u00e9'' (\"to see\") as ''ver\u00e9'', and often spelled so; also ''cad\u00e9''/''car\u00e9'' (\"to fall\") and ''[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Madonna]]''/''Maronna''). Another purported Oscan influence is the historical assimilation of the consonant cluster {{IPA|/nd/}} as {{IPA|/nn/}}, pronounced {{IPA|[n\u02d0]}} (this is generally reflected in spelling more consistently: {{wiktnap|munno}} vs Italian {{wiktita|mondo}} \"world\"; {{wiktnap|quanno}} vs \nItalian {{wiktita|quando}} \"when\"), along with the development of {{IPA|/mb/}} as {{IPA|/mm/}}~{{IPA|[m\u02d0]}} ({{wiktnap|tammuro}} vs Italian {{wiktit|tamburo}} \"drum\"), also consistently reflected in spelling. Other effects of the Oscan [[substratum]] are postulated, but substratum claims are highly controversial. As in many other languages in the [[Italian Peninsula]], Neapolitan has an [[Stratum (linguistics)#Adstratum|adstratum]] greatly influenced by other [[Romance languages]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Franco-Proven\u00e7al]] above all), [[Germanic languages]], [[Greek language|Greek]] (both ancient and modern) and [[Arabic]]. The language had never been standardised, and the word for ''tree'' has three different spellings: {{wiktnap|arbero}}, {{wiktnap|arvero}} and {{wiktnap|\u00e0varo}}.\n\nNeapolitan has enjoyed a rich literary, [[Neapolitan music|musical]] and theatrical history (notably [[Giambattista Basile]], [[Eduardo De Filippo]], [[Salvatore Di Giacomo]] and [[Tot\u00f2]]). Thanks to this heritage and the musical work of [[Renato Carosone]] in the 1950s, Neapolitan is still in use in popular music, even gaining national popularity in the songs of [[Pino Daniele]] and the [[Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare]].\n\nThe language has no official status within Italy and is not taught in schools. The [[University of Naples Federico II]] offers (from 2003) courses in Campanian Dialectology at the faculty of Sociology, whose actual aim is not teaching students to speak the language, but studying its history, usage, literature and social role. There are also ongoing legislative attempts at the national level to have it recognized as an official [[minority language]] of Italy. It is however a recognized [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 639 Joint Advisory Committee language with the language code of ''nap''.\n\nHere is the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] pronunciation of the Neapolitan spoken in the city of Naples:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Much like [[Italian orthography]], it does not contain ''k,'' ''w,'' ''x,'' or ''y'' even though these letters might be found in some foreign words; unlike traditional Italian, it does contain the letter ''j''. The English pronunciation guidelines that follow are based on [[General American]] pronunciation and the values used may not be applicable to other dialects. (See also: [[International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects]].)\n\nAll Romance languages are closely related. Although Neapolitan shares a high degree of its vocabulary with Italian, the official language of Italy, differences in pronunciation often make the connection unrecognizable to those without knowledge of Neapolitan. The most striking phonological difference is the Neapolitan weakening of unstressed vowels into [[schwa]] (''schwa'' is pronounced like the ''a'' in ''about'' or the ''u'' in ''upon''). However it is also possible (and quite common for some Neapolitans) to speak standard Italian with a \"Neapolitan accent\"; that is, by pronouncing un-stressed vowels as schwa but by otherwise using only entirely standard words and grammatical forms. This is not Neapolitan proper, but a mere difference in Italian pronunciation.\n\nTherefore, while pronunciation presents the strongest barrier to comprehension, the grammar of Neapolitan is what sets it apart from Italian. In Neapolitan, for example, the gender and number of a word is expressed by a change in the accented vowel, whereas in Italian it is expressed by a change in the final vowel (e.g. ''l'''uo'''ngo'' {{IPA-nap|\u02c8lwo\u014b\u0261\u0259|}}, ''l'''o'''nga'' {{IPA-nap|\u02c8lo\u014b\u0261\u0259|}}; Italian ''lung'''o''''', ''lung'''a'''''; masc. \"long\", fem. \"long\"). These and other morpho-syntactic differences distinguish the Neapolitan language from the Italian language and the Neapolitan accent.\n\nNeapolitan has had a significant influence on the intonation of [[Rioplatense Spanish]], of the [[Buenos Aires]] region of [[Argentina]], and the whole of [[Uruguay]].<ref>Colantoni, Laura, and Jorge Gurlekian.[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=43F6CF4CEB6223AA2ED40C7926999F70.tomcat1?fromPage=online&aid=236145 \"Convergence and intonation: historical evidence from Buenos Aires Spanish\"], ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition'', Volume 7, Issue 02, August 2004, pp. 107\u2013119, Cambridge Journals Online</ref>\n\n=== Vowels ===\nWhile there are only five graphic vowels in Neapolitan, phonemically, there are eight.  Stressed vowels ''e'' and ''o'' can be either \"[[Close vowel|closed]]\" or \"[[Open vowel|open]]\" and the pronunciation is different for the two.  The grave accent (''\u00e0'', ''\u00e8'', ''\u00f2'') is used to denote open vowels, and the acute accent (''\u00e9'', ''\u00ed'', ''\u00f3'', ''\u00fa'') is used to denote closed vowels, with alternative ''\u00ec'' and ''\u00f9''.  However, accent marks are not commonly used in the actual spelling of words except when they occur on the final syllable of a word, such as ''Tot\u00f2'', ''arriv\u00e0'', or ''pecch\u00e9'' and when they appear here in other positions it is only to demonstrate where the stress, or accent, falls in some words. Also, the [[circumflex]] is used to mark a long vowel where it wouldn't normally occur (e.g. ''s\u00ee'' \"you are\").\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! Letter\n!

Modern Neapolitan uses, almost entirely, shortened forms of these articles which are:\n\nBefore a word beginning with a consonant:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!\n! Singular\n! Plural\n|-\n| '''Masculine'''\n| ''\u2019o''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | ''\u2019e''\n|-\n| '''Feminine'''\n| ''\u2019a''\n|-\n| '''Neuter'''\n| ''\u2019o''\n| \u2013\n|}\n\nThese definite articles are always pronounced distinctly.\n\nBefore a word beginning with a vowel, ''l\u2019'' or ''ll\u2019'' are used \nfor both masculine and feminine, for both singular and plural. Although both forms can be found, the ''ll\u2019'' form is by far the most common.\n\nIt is well to note that in Neapolitan the [[Grammatical gender|gender]] of a noun is not easily determined by the article, so other means must be used.  In the case of ''\u2019o'' which can be either masculine singular or neuter singular (there is no neuter plural in Neapolitan), when it is neuter the initial consonant of the noun is doubled.  As an example, the name of a language in Neapolitan is always neuter, so if we see ''\u2019o nnapulitano'' we know it refers to the Neapolitan language, whereas ''\u2019o napulitano'' would refer to a Neapolitan man.\n\nLikewise, since ''\u2019e'' can be either masculine plural or feminine plural, when it is feminine plural, the initial consonant of the noun is doubled.  As an example, consider ''\u2019a lista'' which in Neapolitan is feminine singular for \"list.\"  In the plural it becomes ''\u2019e lliste''.\n\nThere can also be problems with nouns whose singular form ends in ''e''.  Since plural nouns usually end in ''e'' whether masculine or feminine, the masculine plural is often formed by orthographically changing the spelling.  As an example, consider the word ''guaglione'' (which means \"boy\", or \"girl\" in the feminine form):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!\n! Singular\n! Plural\n|-\n| '''Masculine'''\n| ''\u2019o guaglione''\n| ''\u2019e guagliune''\n|-\n| '''Feminine'''\n| ''\u2019a guagliona''\n| ''\u2019e gguaglione''\n|}\n\nMore will be said about these orthographically changing nouns in the section on Neapolitan nouns.\n\nA couple of notes about consonant doubling:\n\n*Doubling is a function of the article (and certain other words), and these same words may be seen in other contexts without the consonant doubled.  More will be said about this in the section on consonant doubling.\n*Doubling only occurs when the consonant is followed by a vowel.  If it is followed by another consonant, such as in the word ''spagnuolo (Spanish)'', no doubling occurs.\n\n=== Indefinite articles ===\nThe Neapolitan indefinite articles, corresponding to the English ''a'' or ''an'', are presented in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n|-\n| '''Before words beginning with a consonant'''\n| ''nu''\n| ''na''\n|-\n| '''Before words beginning with a vowel'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | ''n\u2019''\n|}\n\n=== Verbal conjugation ===\nIn Neapolitan there are four finite moods: [[indicative mood|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[conditional mood|conditional]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]], and three non-finite modes: [[infinitive]], [[gerund]] and [[participle]]. Each mood has an [[active voice|active]] and a [[passive voice|passive]] form. The only auxiliary verbs used in the active form is {{wiktnap|av\u00e9|(h)av\u00e9}} (Eng. \"to have\", It. ''avere''), which contrasts with Italian in which the intransitive and reflexive verbs take ''\u00e8ssere'' for their auxiliary. For example, we have:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Nap. || Aggio stato a Nnapule ajere. || AUX-HAVE-1st-SING-PRES \"be\"-PART-PAST \"in\"-PREP \"Naples\"-NOUN \"yesterday\"-ADVERB\n|-\n| It. || Sono stato a Napoli ieri. || AUX-BE-1st-SING-PRES \"be\"-PART-PAST \"in\"-PREP \"Naples\"-NOUN \"yesterday\"-ADVERB\n|-\n| Eng. || I was in Naples yesterday.\n|}\n\n=== Doubled initial consonants ===\nIn Neapolitan, many times the initial consonant of a word is doubled.  This is called ''[[raddoppiamento sintattico]]'' in Italian as it also applies to the [[Italian phonology]].\n* All feminine plural nouns, when preceded by the feminine plural definite article, ''\u2019e'', or by any feminine plural adjective, have their initial consonant doubled.\n* All neuter singular nouns, when preceded by the neuter singular definite article, ''\u2019o'', or by a neuter singular adjective, have their initial consonant doubled.\n* In addition, other words also trigger this doubling. Below is a list of words that trigger the doubling of the initial consonant of the word that follows.\nHowever, when there is a pause after the \"trigger\" word, the phonological doubling does not occur (e.g. ''tu s\u00ee (g)guaglione'', [You are a boy], where ''s\u00ee'' is a \"trigger\" word causing doubling of the initial consonant in ''guaglione'' but in the phrase ''\u2019e do s\u00ee, guagli\u00f3?'' [Where are you from, boy?] no doubling occurs). Neither does doubling occur when the initial consonant is followed by another consonant (e.g. ''\u2019o ttaliano'' [the Italian language], but ''\u2019o spagnuolo'' [the Spanish language], where ''\u2019o'' is the neuter definite article).\nThis is what happens phonologically and no orthographic change is required. The same thing happens in Italian, where multiple words trigger first-consonant doubling, e.g. ''la casa'' but ''a (c)casa'', ''io e (t)te'', etc.\n\n==== Words that trigger doubling in pronunciation ====\n\n* The conjunctions '''''e''''' and '''''n\u00e9''''' but not '''''o''''' (e.g. ''pane e ccaso''; ''n\u00e9 (p)pane n\u00e9 (c)caso''; but ''pane o caso'')\n* The prepositions '''''a''''', '''''pe''''', '''''cu''''' (e.g. ''a (m)me''; ''pe (t)te''; ''cu (v)vuje'')\n* The negation '''''nu''''', short for ''nun'' (e.g. ''nu ddicere niente'')\n* The indefinites '''''ogne''''', '''''cocche''''' (e.g. ''ogne (c)casa''; ''cocche (c)cosa'')\n* Interrogative '''''che''''' and relative '''''che''''' but not '''''ca''''' (e.g. ''che (p)piense?''

L'ultimo sovrano delle Due Sicilie</ref>\n\nWhile the term \"Neapolitan language\" is used in this article to refer to the language group of related dialects found in southern continental Italy, it may also refer more specifically to the dialect of the Neapolitan language spoken in the [[Naples metropolitan area|Naples area]] or in [[Campania]]. In fact, in a colloquial or non-academic or non-linguist context, \u201cNeapolitan language\u201d, ''napulitano'', or ''napoletano'' generally refers specifically to the [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of the language spoken in [[Naples]] and the surrounding area; however, this variety is usually [[mutually intelligible]] with other related \u201cNeapolitan language\u201d varieties throughout Southern Italy.{{Citation needed |date=November 2019}}\n\n== Distribution ==\n[[File:WIKITONGUES- Foffo speaking Neapolitan.webm|thumb|A young man speaking Neapolitan.]]\nThe Neapolitan dialects are distributed throughout most of continental [[southern Italy]], historically united during the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], specifically southern [[Lazio]] ([[Gaeta]] and [[Sora, Lazio|Sora]] districts), southern [[Marche]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]], [[Basilicata]], [[Campania]] (Naples), northern and central [[Apulia]], and northernmost [[Calabria]]. The dialects are part of a varied [[dialect continuum]], so the varieties in southern Lazio, Marche, Abruzzo, Molise, Apulia, Lucania and Calabria can typically be recognizable as regional groups of dialects. In western Abruzzo and Lazio the dialects give way to [[Central Italian]] dialects such as [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]]. In central Calabria and southern Apulia, the dialects give way to the [[Sicilian language]]. Largely due to massive southern Italian migration in the late 19th century and early 20th century, there are also numbers of speakers in [[Italian diaspora]] communities in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela]]. However, in the [[United States]] traditional Neapolitan has had considerable contact with English, and is significantly different from contemporary Neapolitan spoken in [[Naples]]. English words are often used in place of Neapolitan words, especially among second-generation speakers. On the other hand, the effect on Neapolitan in Italy has been similar due to displacement by [[Italian language|Standard Italian]].\n\nThe following dialects constitute Neapolitan; numbers refer to the map:<ref>''[http://www.italica.rai.it/principali/lingua/bruni/mappe/flash/regionalok.htm Carta dei Dialetti d'Italia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003072247/http://www.italica.rai.it/principali/lingua/bruni/mappe/flash/regionalok.htm |date=3 October 2012 }}'' (Mapping of dialects of Italy) by Giovan Battista Pellegrini, 1977 (in [[Italian language|Italian]])</ref>\n\n{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-roman\n|Abruzzese and Southern Marchigiano:\n:Ia.

[http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/ital1286 \"Italo-Dalmatian\" Glottolog 2.3]. Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.</ref> There are notable differences among the various dialects, but they are all generally mutually intelligible.\n\n[[Italian language|Italian]] and Neapolitan are of variable mutual comprehensibility, depending on factors that are both affective and linguistic. There are notable grammatical differences, such as Neapolitan having nouns in the neuter form and a unique plural formation as well as historical phonological developments, which often obscure the cognacy of lexical items.\n\nIts evolution has been similar to that of Italian and other Romance languages from their roots in [[Vulgar Latin]]. It may reflect a pre-Latin [[Oscan language|Oscan]] [[Stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]], as in the pronunciation of the ''d'' sound as an ''r'' sound ([[rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]) at the beginning of a word or between two vowels: e.g. ''doje'' (feminine) or ''duje'' (masculine), meaning \"two\", is pronounced, and often spelled, as ''roje''/''ruje''; ''ved\u00e9'' (\"to see\") as ''ver\u00e9'', and often spelled so; also ''cad\u00e9''/''car\u00e9'' (\"to fall\") and ''[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Madonna]]''/''Maronna''). Another purported Oscan influence is the historical assimilation of the consonant cluster {{IPA|/nd/}} as {{IPA|/nn/}}, pronounced {{IPA|[n\u02d0]}} (this is generally reflected in spelling more consistently: {{wiktnap|munno}} vs Italian {{wiktita|mondo}} \"world\"; {{wiktnap|quanno}} vs \nItalian {{wiktita|quando}} \"when\"), along with the development of {{IPA|/mb/}} as {{IPA|/mm/}}~{{IPA|[m\u02d0]}} ({{wiktnap|tammuro}} vs Italian {{wiktit|tamburo}} \"drum\"), also consistently reflected in spelling. Other effects of the Oscan [[substratum]] are postulated, but substratum claims are highly controversial. As in many other languages in the [[Italian Peninsula]], Neapolitan has an [[Stratum (linguistics)#Adstratum|adstratum]] greatly influenced by other [[Romance languages]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Franco-Proven\u00e7al]] above all), [[Germanic languages]], [[Greek language|Greek]] (both ancient and modern) and [[Arabic]]. The language had never been standardised, and the word for ''tree'' has three different spellings: {{wiktnap|arbero}}, {{wiktnap|arvero}} and {{wiktnap|\u00e0varo}}.\n\nNeapolitan has enjoyed a rich literary, [[Neapolitan music|musical]] and theatrical history (notably [[Giambattista Basile]], [[Eduardo De Filippo]], [[Salvatore Di Giacomo]] and [[Tot\u00f2]]). Thanks to this heritage and the musical work of [[Renato Carosone]] in the 1950s, Neapolitan is still in use in popular music, even gaining national popularity in the songs of [[Pino Daniele]] and the [[Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare]].\n\nThe language has no official status within Italy and is not taught in schools. The [[University of Naples Federico II]] offers (from 2003) courses in Campanian Dialectology at the faculty of Sociology, whose actual aim is not teaching students to speak the language, but studying its history, usage, literature and social role. There are also ongoing legislative attempts at the national level to have it recognized as an official [[minority language]] of Italy. It is however a recognized [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 639 Joint Advisory Committee language with the language code of ''nap''.\n\nHere is the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] pronunciation of the Neapolitan spoken in the city of Naples:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Much like [[Italian orthography]], it does not contain ''k,'' ''w,'' ''x,'' or ''y'' even though these letters might be found in some foreign words; like traditional Italian, it does contain the letter ''j''. The English pronunciation guidelines that follow are based on [[General American]] pronunciation and the values used may not be applicable to other dialects. (See also: [[International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects]].)\n\nAll Romance languages are closely related. Although Neapolitan shares a high degree of its vocabulary with Italian, the official language of Italy, differences in pronunciation often make the connection unrecognizable to those without knowledge of Neapolitan. The most striking phonological difference is the Neapolitan weakening of unstressed vowels into [[schwa]] (''schwa'' is pronounced like the ''a'' in ''about'' or the ''u'' in ''upon''). However it is also possible (and quite common for some Neapolitans) to speak standard Italian with a \"Neapolitan accent\"; that is, by pronouncing un-stressed vowels as schwa but by otherwise using only entirely standard words and grammatical forms. This is not Neapolitan proper, but a mere difference in Italian pronunciation.\n\nTherefore, while pronunciation presents the strongest barrier to comprehension, the grammar of Neapolitan is what sets it apart from Italian. In Neapolitan, for example, the gender and number of a word is expressed by a change in the accented vowel, whereas in Italian it is expressed by a change in the final vowel (e.g. ''l'''uo'''ngo'' {{IPA-nap|\u02c8lwo\u014b\u0261\u0259|}}, ''l'''o'''nga'' {{IPA-nap|\u02c8lo\u014b\u0261\u0259|}}; Italian ''lung'''o''''', ''lung'''a'''''; masc. \"long\", fem. \"long\"). These and other morpho-syntactic differences distinguish the Neapolitan language from the Italian language and the Neapolitan accent.\n\nNeapolitan has had a significant influence on the intonation of [[Rioplatense Spanish]], of the [[Buenos Aires]] region of [[Argentina]], and the whole of [[Uruguay]].<ref>Colantoni, Laura, and Jorge Gurlekian.[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=43F6CF4CEB6223AA2ED40C7926999F70.tomcat1?fromPage=online&aid=236145 \"Convergence and intonation: historical evidence from Buenos Aires Spanish\"], ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition'', Volume 7, Issue 02, August 2004, pp. 107\u2013119, Cambridge Journals Online</ref>\n\n=== Vowels ===\nWhile there are only five graphic vowels in Neapolitan, phonemically, there are eight.  Stressed vowels ''e'' and ''o'' can be either \"[[Close vowel|closed]]\" or \"[[Open vowel|open]]\" and the pronunciation is different for the two.  The grave accent (''\u00e0'', ''\u00e8'', ''\u00f2'') is used to denote open vowels, and the acute accent (''\u00e9'', ''\u00ed'', ''\u00f3'', ''\u00fa'') is used to denote closed vowels, with alternative ''\u00ec'' and ''\u00f9''.  However, accent marks are not commonly used in the actual spelling of words except when they occur on the final syllable of a word, such as ''Tot\u00f2'', ''arriv\u00e0'', or ''pecch\u00e9'' and when they appear here in other positions it is only to demonstrate where the stress, or accent, falls in some words. Also, the [[circumflex]] is used to mark a long vowel where it wouldn't normally occur (e.g. ''s\u00ee'' \"you are\").\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! Letter\n!

Modern Neapolitan uses, almost entirely, shortened forms of these articles which are:\n\nBefore a word beginning with a consonant:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!\n! Singular\n! Plural\n|-\n| '''Masculine'''\n| ''\u2019o''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | ''\u2019e''\n|-\n| '''Feminine'''\n| ''\u2019a''\n|-\n| '''Neuter'''\n| ''\u2019o''\n| \u2013\n|}\n\nThese definite articles are always pronounced distinctly.\n\nBefore a word beginning with a vowel, ''l\u2019'' or ''ll\u2019'' are used \nfor both masculine and feminine, for both singular and plural. Although both forms can be found, the ''ll\u2019'' form is by far the most common.\n\nIt is well to note that in Neapolitan the [[Grammatical gender|gender]] of a noun is not easily determined by the article, so other means must be used.  In the case of ''\u2019o'' which can be either masculine singular or neuter singular (there is no neuter plural in Neapolitan), when it is neuter the initial consonant of the noun is doubled.  As an example, the name of a language in Neapolitan is always neuter, so if we see ''\u2019o nnapulitano'' we know it refers to the Neapolitan language, whereas ''\u2019o napulitano'' would refer to a Neapolitan man.\n\nLikewise, since ''\u2019e'' can be either masculine plural or feminine plural, when it is feminine plural, the initial consonant of the noun is doubled.  As an example, consider ''\u2019a lista'' which in Neapolitan is feminine singular for \"list.\"  In the plural it becomes ''\u2019e lliste''.\n\nThere can also be problems with nouns whose singular form ends in ''e''.  Since plural nouns usually end in ''e'' whether masculine or feminine, the masculine plural is often formed by orthographically changing the spelling.  As an example, consider the word ''guaglione'' (which means \"boy\", or \"girl\" in the feminine form):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!\n! Singular\n! Plural\n|-\n| '''Masculine'''\n| ''\u2019o guaglione''\n| ''\u2019e guagliune''\n|-\n| '''Feminine'''\n| ''\u2019a guagliona''\n| ''\u2019e gguaglione''\n|}\n\nMore will be said about these orthographically changing nouns in the section on Neapolitan nouns.\n\nA couple of notes about consonant doubling:\n\n*Doubling is a function of the article (and certain other words), and these same words may be seen in other contexts without the consonant doubled.  More will be said about this in the section on consonant doubling.\n*Doubling only occurs when the consonant is followed by a vowel.  If it is followed by another consonant, such as in the word ''spagnuolo (Spanish)'', no doubling occurs.\n\n=== Indefinite articles ===\nThe Neapolitan indefinite articles, corresponding to the English ''a'' or ''an'', are presented in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n|-\n| '''Before words beginning with a consonant'''\n| ''nu''\n| ''na''\n|-\n| '''Before words beginning with a vowel'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | ''n\u2019''\n|}\n\n=== Verbal conjugation ===\nIn Neapolitan there are four finite moods: [[indicative mood|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[conditional mood|conditional]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]], and three non-finite modes: [[infinitive]], [[gerund]] and [[participle]]. Each mood has an [[active voice|active]] and a [[passive voice|passive]] form. The only auxiliary verbs used in the active form is {{wiktnap|av\u00e9|(h)av\u00e9}} (Eng. \"to have\", It. ''avere''), which contrasts with Italian in which the intransitive and reflexive verbs take ''\u00e8ssere'' for their auxiliary. For example, we have:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Nap. || Aggio stato a Nnapule ajere. || AUX-HAVE-1st-SING-PRES \"be\"-PART-PAST \"in\"-PREP \"Naples\"-NOUN \"yesterday\"-ADVERB\n|-\n| It. || Sono stato a Napoli ieri. || AUX-BE-1st-SING-PRES \"be\"-PART-PAST \"in\"-PREP \"Naples\"-NOUN \"yesterday\"-ADVERB\n|-\n| Eng. || I was in Naples yesterday.\n|}\n\n=== Doubled initial consonants ===\nIn Neapolitan, many times the initial consonant of a word is doubled.  This is called ''[[raddoppiamento sintattico]]'' in Italian as it also applies to the [[Italian phonology]].\n* All feminine plural nouns, when preceded by the feminine plural definite article, ''\u2019e'', or by any feminine plural adjective, have their initial consonant doubled.\n* All neuter singular nouns, when preceded by the neuter singular definite article, ''\u2019o'', or by a neuter singular adjective, have their initial consonant doubled.\n* In addition, other words also trigger this doubling. Below is a list of words that trigger the doubling of the initial consonant of the word that follows.\nHowever, when there is a pause after the \"trigger\" word, the phonological doubling does not occur (e.g. ''tu s\u00ee (g)guaglione'', [You are a boy], where ''s\u00ee'' is a \"trigger\" word causing doubling of the initial consonant in ''guaglione'' but in the phrase ''\u2019e do s\u00ee, guagli\u00f3?'' [Where are you from, boy?] no doubling occurs). Neither does doubling occur when the initial consonant is followed by another consonant (e.g. ''\u2019o ttaliano'' [the Italian language], but ''\u2019o spagnuolo'' [the Spanish language], where ''\u2019o'' is the neuter definite article).\nThis is what happens phonologically and no orthographic change is required.
