Calorie consumption is reduced because less fat is consumed. Diets of this type include NCEP Step I and II. A meta-analysis of 16 trials of 2\u201312&nbsp;months' duration found that low-fat diets (without intentional restriction of caloric intake) resulted in average weight loss of {{convert|3.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}} over habitual eating.<ref name=Strychar/>\n\n===Low-carbohydrate===\n{{Main|Low-carbohydrate diet}}\nLow-carbohydrate diets are relatively high in protein and fats. Low-carbohydrate diets are sometimes ''[[ketogenic diet|ketogenic]]'' (i.e., they restrict carbohydrate intake sufficiently to cause [[ketosis]]).\n\n===Low-calorie===\n{{Main|Calorie restriction}}\nLow-calorie diets usually produce an energy deficit of 500\u20131,000 calories per day, which can result in a {{convert|0.5|to|1|kg|lb|abbr=off}} weight loss per week. One of the most commonly used low-calorie diets is [[Weight Watchers (diet)|Weight Watchers]]. The National Institutes of Health reviewed 34 [[randomized controlled trial]]s to determine the effectiveness of low-calorie diets. They found that these diets lowered total body mass by 8% in the short term, over 3\u201312 months.<ref name=Strychar/> Women doing low-calorie diets should have at least 1,000 calories per day and men should have approximately 1,200 calories per day. These caloric intake values vary depending on additional factors, such as age and weight.<ref name=\"Strychar\" />\n\n===Very low-calorie===\n{{Main|Very low calorie diet}}\nVery low calorie diets provide 200\u2013800 calories per day, maintaining protein intake but limiting calories from both fat and carbohydrates. They subject the body to [[starvation]] and produce an average loss of {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} per week. \"2-4-6-8\", a popular diet of this variety, follows a four-day cycle in which only 200 calories are consumed the first day, 400 the second day, 600 the third day, 800 the fourth day, and then totally [[fasting]], after which the cycle repeats. These is some evidence that these diets results in considerable weight loss.<ref name=\"Thom2017\" /> These diets are not recommended for general use and should be reserved for the [[management of obesity]] as they are associated with [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse side effect]]s such as loss of lean muscle mass, increased risks of [[gout]], and [[electrolyte imbalance]]s. People attempting these diets must be monitored closely by a physician to prevent complications.<ref name=Strychar/>\n\n===Meals timing===\n\nMeals timing schedule is known to be an important factor of any diet. Recent evidence suggest that new scheduling strategies, such as [[intermittent fasting]] or skipping meals, and strategically placed snacks before meals, may be recommendable to reduce cardiovascular risks as part of a broader lifestyle and [[healthy diet|dietary change]].<ref name=\"AHA2017\">{{cite journal |last1=St-Onge |first1=MP |last2=Ard |first2=J |last3=Baskin |first3=ML |last4=Chiuve |first4=SE |last5=Johnson |first5=HM |last6=Kris-Etherton |first6=P |last7=Varady |first7=K |last8=American Heart Association Obesity Committee of the Council on Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health; Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young; Council on Clinical Cardiology; and Stroke |first8=Council. |title=Meal Timing and Frequency: Implications for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association. |journal=Circulation |date=28 February 2017 |volume=135 |issue=9 |pages=e96\u2013e121 |doi=10.1161/CIR.0000000000000476 |pmid=28137935}}</ref>\n\n===Detox===\n{{Main|Detox diet}}\nDetox diets are promoted with unsubstantiated claims that they can eliminate \"toxins\" from the human body.

[[Eastern Orthodox Christians]] fast during specified fasting seasons of the year, which include not only the better-known [[Great Lent]], but also fasts on every Wednesday and Friday (except on special holidays), together with extended fasting periods before Christmas (the [[Nativity Fast]]), after Easter (the [[Apostles Fast]]) and in early August (the [[Dormition Fast]]). Members of [[Latter Day Saint movement|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormon]]s) generally fast for 24 hours on the first Sunday of each month. Like Muslims, they refrain from all drinking and eating unless they are children or are physically unable to fast. Fasting is also a feature of [[ascetic]] traditions in religions such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. [[Mahayana]] traditions that follow the [[Brahma's Net Sutra]] may recommend that the laity fast \"during the six days of fasting each month and the three months of fasting each year\" [Brahma's Net Sutra, minor precept 30]. Members of the [[Baha'i Faith]] observe a [[Nineteen Day Fast]] from sunrise to sunset during March each year.\n\n===Environmentally sustainable diets===\nAnother kind of diet focuses not on the dieter's health effects, but on its environment.

The first source to which the body turns is [[glycogen]] (by [[glycogenolysis]]). Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate, 65% of which is stored in skeletal muscles and the remainder in the liver (totaling about 2,000 [[kcal]] in the whole body). It is created from the excess of ingested [[nutrients|macronutrients]], mainly carbohydrates. When glycogen is nearly depleted, the body begins [[lipolysis]], the mobilization and catabolism of fat stores for energy. In this process fats, obtained from adipose tissue, or [[fat cells]], are broken down into [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acids]], which can be used to generate energy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O\u2019Rourke|first=Brian|last2=Cortassa|first2=Sonia|last3=Aon|first3=Miguel A.|date=2005-10-01|title=Mitochondrial Ion Channels: Gatekeepers of Life and Death|journal=Physiology|language=en|volume=20|issue=5|pages=303\u2013315|doi=10.1152/physiol.00020.2005|issn=1548-9213|pmc=2739045|pmid=16174870}}</ref> The primary by-products of metabolism are carbon dioxide and water; carbon dioxide is expelled through the respiratory system.\n\n==Weight loss groups==\nSome [https://myfitness-hub.blogspot.com/2020/04/low-carb-meal-plan.html weight loss] groups aim to make money, others work as charities. The former include [[WW International|Weight Watchers]] and [[Peertrainer]]. The latter include [[Overeaters Anonymous]], [[TOPS Club]] and groups run by local organizations.\n\nThese organizations' customs and practices differ widely. Some groups are modelled on [[twelve-step program]]s, while others are quite informal. Some groups advocate certain prepared foods or special menus, while others train dieters to make healthy choices from restaurant menus and while grocery-shopping and cooking.\n\n==Food diary==\nA 2008 study published in the [[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]] showed that dieters who kept a daily food [[Personal journal|diary]] (or diet journal), lost twice as much weight as those who did not keep a food log, suggesting that if a person records their eating, they are more aware of what they consume and therefore eat fewer calories.<ref>{{cite news| title= Using food diaries doubles weight loss, study shows | url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/weightloss/2008-07-08-food-diaries%5FN.htm | date= 8 July 2008 | work=USA Today | first=Nanci | last=Hellmich | accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Possible weight loss effects of drinking water prior to meals==\n{{Main | Weight loss effects of water}}\nA 2009 review found limited evidence suggesting that encouraging water consumption and substituting energy-free beverages for energy-containing beverages (i.e., reducing caloric intake) may facilitate weight management.

(References given in [[Weight loss effects of water|main article]].)\n\n==Fasting==\n{{Main|Fasting|Intermittent fasting}}\nFasting is when there is a long time interval between the meals. In dieting, long term (periodic) fasting is not recommended, instead, having small portions of food after small intervals is encouraged. Lengthy fasting can also be dangerous due to the risk of [[malnutrition]] and should be carried out only under medical supervision.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Horne |first1=BD |last2=Muhlestein |first2=JB |last3=Anderson |first3=JL |title=Health effects of intermittent fasting: hormesis or harm?

Once glycogen is depleted the body begins to fuel the brain using ketones, while also metabolizing body protein (including but not limited to skeletal muscle) to be used to synthesize sugars for use as energy by the rest of the body. Most experts believe that a prolonged fast can lead to muscle wasting, although some dispute this. The use of short-term fasting, or various forms of [[intermittent fasting]], have been used as a form of dieting to circumvent the issues of long fasting.\n\n== Crash Dieting ==\n{{Main|Very-low-calorie diet}}\nThe concept of crash dieting is to drastically reduce calories, using a [[very-low-calorie diet]].<ref>{{cite web |title=How to diet |url=https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/how-to-diet/ |website=nhs.uk |language=en |date=27 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Take the test: Is an 800-calorie diet right for me? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/crash_diet_test |website=BBC Food |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonet |first1=Anna |title=Are crash diets ever a good idea for weight loss? |url=https://www.netdoctor.co.uk/healthy-eating/a25288668/are-crash-diets-bad-for-you/ |website=Netdoctor |date=28 November 2018 |quote='A crash diet is typically a very low-calorie diet, where you eat a very restrictively for a short period of time,' explains Registered Dietician, Helen Bond.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Crash diets can cause transient deterioration in heart function |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180202123836.htm |website=ScienceDaily |language=en |date=2018-02-02}}</ref> Crash dieting can be highly dangerous because it can cause various kind of issues for the human body.

A 2019 systematic review of multiple weight change procedures, including alternate day fasting and time-restricted feeding but also exercise and overeating, found systematic \"energetic errors\" for all these procedures. This shows that the body cannot precisely compensate for errors in energy/calorie intake, countering the Set-Point Theory and potentially explaining both [[weight loss]] and weight gain such as [[obesity]].

Calorie consumption is reduced because less fat is consumed. Diets of this type include NCEP Step I and II. A meta-analysis of 16 trials of 2\u201312&nbsp;months' duration found that low-fat diets (without intentional restriction of caloric intake) resulted in average weight loss of {{convert|3.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}} over habitual eating.<ref name=Strychar/>\n\n===Low-carbohydrate===\n{{Main|Low-carbohydrate diet}}\nLow-carbohydrate diets are relatively high in protein and fats. Low-carbohydrate diets are sometimes ''[[ketogenic diet|ketogenic]]'' (i.e., they restrict carbohydrate intake sufficiently to cause [[ketosis]]).\n\n===Low-calorie===\n{{Main|Calorie restriction}}\nLow-calorie diets usually produce an energy deficit of 500\u20131,000 calories per day, which can result in a {{convert|0.5|to|1|kg|lb|abbr=off}} weight loss per week. One of the most commonly used low-calorie diets is [[Weight Watchers (diet)|Weight Watchers]]. The National Institutes of Health reviewed 34 [[randomized controlled trial]]s to determine the effectiveness of low-calorie diets. They found that these diets lowered total body mass by 8% in the short term, over 3\u201312 months.<ref name=Strychar/> Women doing low-calorie diets should have at least 1,000 calories per day and men should have approximately 1,200 calories per day. These caloric intake values vary depending on additional factors, such as age and weight.<ref name=\"Strychar\" />\n\n===Very low-calorie===\n{{Main|Very low calorie diet}}\nVery low calorie diets provide 200\u2013800 calories per day, maintaining protein intake but limiting calories from both fat and carbohydrates. They subject the body to [[starvation]] and produce an average loss of {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} per week. \"2-4-6-8\", a popular diet of this variety, follows a four-day cycle in which only 200 calories are consumed the first day, 400 the second day, 600 the third day, 800 the fourth day, and then totally [[fasting]], after which the cycle repeats. These is some evidence that these diets results in considerable weight loss.<ref name=\"Thom2017\" /> These diets are not recommended for general use and should be reserved for the [[management of obesity]] as they are associated with [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse side effect]]s such as loss of lean muscle mass, increased risks of [[gout]], and [[electrolyte imbalance]]s. People attempting these diets must be monitored closely by a physician to prevent complications.<ref name=Strychar/>\n\n===Meals timing===\n\nMeals timing schedule is known to be an important factor of any diet. Recent evidence suggest that new scheduling strategies, such as [[intermittent fasting]] or skipping meals, and strategically placed snacks before meals, may be recommendable to reduce cardiovascular risks as part of a broader lifestyle and [[healthy diet|dietary change]].<ref name=\"AHA2017\">{{cite journal |last1=St-Onge |first1=MP |last2=Ard |first2=J |last3=Baskin |first3=ML |last4=Chiuve |first4=SE |last5=Johnson |first5=HM |last6=Kris-Etherton |first6=P |last7=Varady |first7=K |last8=American Heart Association Obesity Committee of the Council on Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health; Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young; Council on Clinical Cardiology; and Stroke |first8=Council. |title=Meal Timing and Frequency: Implications for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association. |journal=Circulation |date=28 February 2017 |volume=135 |issue=9 |pages=e96\u2013e121 |doi=10.1161/CIR.0000000000000476 |pmid=28137935}}</ref>\n\n===Detox===\n{{Main|Detox diet}}\nDetox diets are promoted with unsubstantiated claims that they can eliminate \"toxins\" from the human body.

[[Eastern Orthodox Christians]] fast during specified fasting seasons of the year, which include not only the better-known [[Great Lent]], but also fasts on every Wednesday and Friday (except on special holidays), together with extended fasting periods before Christmas (the [[Nativity Fast]]), after Easter (the [[Apostles Fast]]) and in early August (the [[Dormition Fast]]). Members of [[Latter Day Saint movement|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormon]]s) generally fast for 24 hours on the first Sunday of each month. Like Muslims, they refrain from all drinking and eating unless they are children or are physically unable to fast. Fasting is also a feature of [[ascetic]] traditions in religions such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. [[Mahayana]] traditions that follow the [[Brahma's Net Sutra]] may recommend that the laity fast \"during the six days of fasting each month and the three months of fasting each year\" [Brahma's Net Sutra, minor precept 30]. Members of the [[Baha'i Faith]] observe a [[Nineteen Day Fast]] from sunrise to sunset during March each year.\n\n===Environmentally sustainable diets===\nAnother kind of diet focuses not on the dieter's health effects, but on its environment.

The first source to which the body turns is [[glycogen]] (by [[glycogenolysis]]). Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate, 65% of which is stored in skeletal muscles and the remainder in the liver (totaling about 2,000 [[kcal]] in the whole body). It is created from the excess of ingested [[nutrients|macronutrients]], mainly carbohydrates. When glycogen is nearly depleted, the body begins [[lipolysis]], the mobilization and catabolism of fat stores for energy. In this process fats, obtained from adipose tissue, or [[fat cells]], are broken down into [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acids]], which can be used to generate energy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O\u2019Rourke|first=Brian|last2=Cortassa|first2=Sonia|last3=Aon|first3=Miguel A.|date=2005-10-01|title=Mitochondrial Ion Channels: Gatekeepers of Life and Death|journal=Physiology|language=en|volume=20|issue=5|pages=303\u2013315|doi=10.1152/physiol.00020.2005|issn=1548-9213|pmc=2739045|pmid=16174870}}</ref> The primary by-products of metabolism are carbon dioxide and water; carbon dioxide is expelled through the respiratory system.\n\n==Weight loss groups==\nSome weight loss groups aim to make money, others work as charities. The former include [[WW International|Weight Watchers]] and [[Peertrainer]]. The latter include [[Overeaters Anonymous]], [[TOPS Club]] and groups run by local organizations.\n\nThese organizations' customs and practices differ widely. Some groups are modelled on [[twelve-step program]]s, while others are quite informal. Some groups advocate certain prepared foods or special menus, while others train dieters to make healthy choices from restaurant menus and while grocery-shopping and cooking.\n\n==Food diary==\nA 2008 study published in the [[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]] showed that dieters who kept a daily food [[Personal journal|diary]] (or diet journal), lost twice as much weight as those who did not keep a food log, suggesting that if a person records their eating, they are more aware of what they consume and therefore eat fewer calories.<ref>{{cite news| title= Using food diaries doubles weight loss, study shows | url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/weightloss/2008-07-08-food-diaries%5FN.htm | date= 8 July 2008 | work=USA Today | first=Nanci | last=Hellmich | accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Possible weight loss effects of drinking water prior to meals==\n{{Main | Weight loss effects of water}}\nA 2009 review found limited evidence suggesting that encouraging water consumption and substituting energy-free beverages for energy-containing beverages (i.e., reducing caloric intake) may facilitate weight management. A 2009 article found that drinking 500&nbsp;ml of water prior to meals for a 12-week period resulted in increased long-term weight reduction. (References given in [[Weight loss effects of water|main article]].)\n\n==Fasting==\n{{Main|Fasting|Intermittent fasting}}\nFasting is when there is a long time interval between the meals. In dieting, long term (periodic) fasting is not recommended, instead, having small portions of food after small intervals is encouraged. Lengthy fasting can also be dangerous due to the risk of [[malnutrition]] and should be carried out only under medical supervision.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Horne |first1=BD |last2=Muhlestein |first2=JB |last3=Anderson |first3=JL |title=Health effects of intermittent fasting: hormesis or harm?

Once glycogen is depleted the body begins to fuel the brain using ketones, while also metabolizing body protein (including but not limited to skeletal muscle) to be used to synthesize sugars for use as energy by the rest of the body. Most experts believe that a prolonged fast can lead to muscle wasting, although some dispute this. The use of short-term fasting, or various forms of [[intermittent fasting]], have been used as a form of dieting to circumvent the issues of long fasting.\n\n== Crash Dieting ==\n{{Main|Very-low-calorie diet}}\nThe concept of crash dieting is to drastically reduce calories, using a [[very-low-calorie diet]].<ref>{{cite web |title=How to diet |url=https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/how-to-diet/ |website=nhs.uk |language=en |date=27 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Take the test: Is an 800-calorie diet right for me? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/crash_diet_test |website=BBC Food |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonet |first1=Anna |title=Are crash diets ever a good idea for weight loss? |url=https://www.netdoctor.co.uk/healthy-eating/a25288668/are-crash-diets-bad-for-you/ |website=Netdoctor |date=28 November 2018 |quote='A crash diet is typically a very low-calorie diet, where you eat a very restrictively for a short period of time,' explains Registered Dietician, Helen Bond.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Crash diets can cause transient deterioration in heart function |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180202123836.htm |website=ScienceDaily |language=en |date=2018-02-02}}</ref> Crash dieting can be highly dangerous because it can cause various kind of issues for the human body.

A 2019 systematic review of multiple weight change procedures, including alternate day fasting and time-restricted feeding but also exercise and overeating, found systematic \"energetic errors\" for all these procedures. This shows that the body cannot precisely compensate for errors in energy/calorie intake, countering the Set-Point Theory and potentially explaining both [[weight loss]] and weight gain such as [[obesity]].
