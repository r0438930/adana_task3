New York: Plenum.</ref> Because techniques for studying the human brain were limited at the time, he turned to studies of rodents where the brain could be studied in detail. He chose to focus on a simple behavioral model, Pavlovian fear conditioning. This procedure allowed him to follow the flow of information about a stimulus through the brain as it comes to control behavioral responses by way of sensory pathways to the amygdala, and gave rise to the notion of two sensory roads to the amygdala, with the \"low road\" being a quick and dirty subcortical pathway for rapid activity behavioral responses to threats and the \"high road\" providing slower but highly processed cortical information.<ref>LeDoux JE (1994) Emotion, memory and the brain.

LeDoux has argued that so-called Pavlovian fear conditioning should be renamed Pavlovian threat conditioning to avoid the implication that \"fear\" is being acquired in rats or humans.<ref>LeDoux JE (2014) [http://www.pnas.org/content/111/8/2871.full Coming to terms with fear]. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 111:2871-2878.</ref>\n\nIn 2015 he emphasised the notion of survival functions mediated by survival circuits, the purpose of which is to keep organisms alive (rather than to make emotions). For example, defensive survival circuits exist to detect and respond to threats, and can be present in all organisms. However, only organisms that can be conscious of their own brain's activities can feel fear. Fear is a conscious experience and occurs the same way as any other kind of conscious experience: via cortical circuits that allow attention to certain forms of brain activity. He argues the only differences between an emotional and non-emotion state of consciousness are the underlying neural ingredients that contribute to the state.<ref>LeDoux JE (2015) [http://www.cns.nyu.edu/home/ledoux/pdf/daed_LeDoux_2015.pdf Feelings: What are they and how does the brain make them?] Daedalus 144.</ref> These ideas and their implications for understanding the neural foundations of pathological fear and anxiety are explained in his 2015 book, Anxious.<ref>LeDoux JE (2015) Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety. New York: Viking.</ref> In this he says \"Fear and anxiety are not biologically wired... They are the consequence of the cognitive processing of nonemotional ingredients.\"<ref>ANxiety, 2015, Chapter 9, p232</ref>\n\nIn 2018 he further said that the [[amygdala]] may release hormones due to a trigger (such as an innate reaction to seeing a snake), but \"then we elaborate it through cognitive and conscious processes\". He differentiated between the defence system, which has evolved over time, and emotions such as fear and [[anxiety]]. He points out that even simple organisms such as bacteria move in response to threats; \"It's in the brain to allow an organism, whether it be a bacterium or a human, to detect and respond to danger.&nbsp;... It's not in the brain to create feelings like fear and [[anxiety]].\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://brainworldmagazine.com/on-fear-emotions-and-memory-an-interview-with-dr-joseph-ledoux/2/ | title=On Fear, Emotions, and Memory: An Interview with Dr. Joseph LeDoux \u00bb Page 2 of 2 \u00bb Brain World| date=2018-06-07}}</ref> [[Lisa Feldman Barrett]] takes a similar view.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Awards and professional recognition ==\nLeDoux has received a number of awards, including the [[Karl Spencer Lashley Award]] from the [[American Philosophical Society]], the Fyssen International Prize in Cognitive Science, Jean Louis Signoret Prize of the IPSEN Foundation, the Santiago Grisolia Prize, the [[American Psychological Association]] Distinguished Scientific Contributions Award, and the American Psychological Association [[Donald O.

He attended St. Edmund's Elementary School and Eunice High School, graduating in 1967. LeDoux attended [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]] where he majored in Business Administration and minored in Psychology. In 1972 he began work on a Masters of Science in Marketing from LSU. During this time, his interest in psychology grew and he volunteered in the laboratory of Robert Thompson, who introduced him to brain research.\n\n== Academic and professional history ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020|small=y}}\nIn the fall of 1974 LeDoux began a PhD program at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]], and completed his degree in 1977. In 1978, LeDoux joined the Department of Neurology at [[Cornell Medical School]] as a postdoctoral fellow and remained there through the rank of associate professor until 1989. During most of his time at Cornell, he worked in the Neurobiology Laboratory where he received technical training in state-of-the-art neuroscience techniques and began the research program on the brain mechanism of emotional memory that he has pursued ever since. In 1989 he joined the newly formed Center for Neural Science at NYU as an associate professor. In 1991 he was promoted to full professor, and in 1996 he became the Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science. In 2005, he was named university professor, the highest honor for a faculty member at NYU.\n\n== Personal life ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020|small=y}}\nIn 1971 LeDoux married LSU classmate Diana Steen. They divorced amicably in 1978. Since 1982 he has been married to art critic Nancy Princenthal. Currently they reside in the Williamsburg area of [[Brooklyn]]. They have two children, Jacob S. LeDoux (died 2005) and Milo E. LeDoux. Milo is a graduate of the [[University of Oxford]], where he studied classics, and is now pursuing a career in law.\n\n== Music ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020|small=y}}\nCajun/zydeco, country, R&B, rock, and their fusion into \"[[swamp pop]]\", were influences in LeDoux's childhood. In high school, he was a disc jockey at the local radio station, KEUN, and the rhythm guitarist of two bands: the Deadbeats and the Countdowns. Although he remained an avid music fan in later life, he did not actively play guitar for many years. In 2004, LeDoux and NYU Biology Professor [[Tyler Volk]] began performing as a cover band for small parties around NYU, and in 2006 they formed The Amygdaloids. The original band also included [[Daniela Schiller]], (then an NYU postdoctoral fellow), and graduate student Nina Curley. The band's lyrics, mostly written by LeDoux, are based on neuroscientific, psychological, and philosophical themes, and offer scholarly insights into the role of mind and brain in daily life. Their inaugural CD, Heavy Mental, was released in 2007. On their second CD, Theory of My Mind, LeDoux and Grammy winner Rosanne Cash sing \"Crime of Passion\" and \"Mind over Matter\", both written by LeDoux. In 2012, the band released All in Our Minds, an EP in which all songs had \"mind\" in their title. Anxious, a companion to LeDoux's book with the same title, was released in 2015 and explores some of the same scientific themes as the book, but through song. The band's unique focus on original songs about mind and brain has landed them considerable press. They play regularly in New York City, and have also performed in Washington DC, San Antonio TX, Indianapolis IN, Lafayette LA, and Montreal. LeDoux and Amygdaloids' bassist Colin Dempsey perform as an acoustic duo called So We Are.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140113054146/http://www.cns.nyu.edu/ledoux/ledoux_bio.htm LeDouxlab \u2014 LeDoux Biography]\n*[http://www.cns.nyu.edu/corefaculty/LeDoux.php NYU/NCS : Core Faculty : Joseph LeDoux]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/psychiatrylectures#p/c/6C554BA4850E7DA4/0/9_IIgXWdF-w LeDoux Lecture \"What fearful rats can tell us about psychiatric treatment\"]\n*[http://nousthepodcast.libsyn.com/joseph-ledoux-on-the-4-billion-year-journey-to-our-conscious-selves Joseph LeDoux interviewed on NOUS the podcast 'On the 4 billion year journey to our conscious selves']\n{{Psychology|state=uncollapsed}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ledoux, Joseph E.}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1949 births]]\n[[Category:Cognitive scientists]]\n[[Category:American neuroscientists]]\n[[Category:American psychologists]]\n[[Category:20th-century psychologists]]\n[[Category:21st-century psychologists]]\n[[Category:Stony Brook University alumni]]\n[[Category:New York University faculty]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Weill Medical College of Cornell University faculty]]\n", "text_old": "'''Joseph E.

He attended St. Edmund's Elementary School and Eunice High School, graduating in 1967. LeDoux attended [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]] where he majored in Business Administration and minored in Psychology. In 1972 he began work on a Masters of Science in Marketing from LSU. During this time, his interest in psychology grew and he volunteered in the laboratory of Robert Thompson, who introduced him to brain research.\n\n== Academic and professional history ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020|small=y}}\nIn the fall of 1974 LeDoux began a PhD program at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]], and completed his degree in 1977. In 1978, LeDoux joined the Department of Neurology at [[Cornell Medical School]] as a postdoctoral fellow and remained there through the rank of associate professor until 1989. During most of his time at Cornell, he worked in the Neurobiology Laboratory where he received technical training in state-of-the-art neuroscience techniques and began the research program on the brain mechanism of emotional memory that he has pursued ever since. In 1989 he joined the newly formed Center for Neural Science at NYU as an associate professor. In 1991 he was promoted to full professor, and in 1996 he became the Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science. In 2005, he was named university professor, the highest honor for a faculty member at NYU.\n\n== Personal life ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020|small=y}}\nIn 1971 LeDoux married LSU classmate Diana Steen. They divorced amicably in 1978. Since 1982 he has been married to art critic Nancy Princenthal. Currently they reside in the Williamsburg area of [[Brooklyn]]. They have two children, Jacob S. LeDoux (died 2005) and Milo E. LeDoux. Milo is a graduate of the [[University of Oxford]], where he studied classics, and is now pursuing a career in law.\n\n== Music ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020|small=y}}\nCajun/zydeco, country, R&B, rock, and their fusion into \"[[swamp pop]]\", were influences in LeDoux's childhood. In high school, he was a disc jockey at the local radio station, KEUN, and the rhythm guitarist of two bands: the Deadbeats and the Countdowns. Although he remained an avid music fan in later life, he did not actively play guitar for many years. In 2004, LeDoux and NYU Biology Professor [[Tyler Volk]] began performing as a cover band for small parties around NYU, and in 2006 they formed The Amygdaloids. The original band also included [[Daniela Schiller]], (then an NYU postdoctoral fellow), and graduate student Nina Curley. The band's lyrics, mostly written by LeDoux, are based on neuroscientific, psychological, and philosophical themes, and offer scholarly insights into the role of mind and brain in daily life. Their inaugural CD, Heavy Mental, was released in 2007. On their second CD, Theory of My Mind, LeDoux and Grammy winner Rosanne Cash sing \"Crime of Passion\" and \"Mind over Matter\", both written by LeDoux. In 2012, the band released All in Our Minds, an EP in which all songs had \"mind\" in their title. Anxious, a companion to LeDoux's book with the same title, was released in 2015 and explores some of the same scientific themes as the book, but through song. The band's unique focus on original songs about mind and brain has landed them considerable press. They play regularly in New York City, and have also performed in Washington DC, San Antonio TX, Indianapolis IN, Lafayette LA, and Montreal. LeDoux and Amygdaloids' bassist Colin Dempsey perform as an acoustic duo called So We Are.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140113054146/http://www.cns.nyu.edu/ledoux/ledoux_bio.htm LeDouxlab \u2014 LeDoux Biography]\n*[http://www.cns.nyu.edu/corefaculty/LeDoux.php NYU/NCS : Core Faculty : Joseph LeDoux]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/psychiatrylectures#p/c/6C554BA4850E7DA4/0/9_IIgXWdF-w LeDoux Lecture \"What fearful rats can tell us about psychiatric treatment\"]\n*[http://nousthepodcast.libsyn.com/joseph-ledoux-on-the-4-billion-year-journey-to-our-conscious-selves Joseph LeDoux interviewed on NOUS the podcast 'On the 4 billion year journey to our conscious selves']\n{{Psychology|state=uncollapsed}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ledoux, Joseph E.}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1949 births]]\n[[Category:Cognitive scientists]]\n[[Category:American neuroscientists]]\n[[Category:American psychologists]]\n[[Category:20th-century psychologists]]\n[[Category:21st-century psychologists]]\n[[Category:Stony Brook University alumni]]\n[[Category:New York University faculty]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Weill Medical College of Cornell University faculty]]\n", "name_user": "Ira Leviton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Deleted a duplicate \"the\".", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_E._LeDoux"}
