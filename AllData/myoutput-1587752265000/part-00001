In flashbacks it is revealed that Josh killed Ray, and has been cured of the werewolf curse, but Nora has not been so lucky. The couple have been trying to recover Sally from Limbo, ultimately contacting a medium who at first refuses to help, but finally directs them to Donna, a witch who demands $2,000, Sally's body, and the heart of someone they have killed (they choose Ray). In Limbo, Sally, Nick and Stevie have been trying unsuccessfully to escape Limbo's version of the brownstone when finally Donna's spell releases them. Sally awakes in her human body, fearing that her friends may have woken in their coffins. Elsewhere, Aidan, underground in his coffin, is rescued by Atlee, who reveals that an influenza virus not deadly to humans has killed almost all vampires, including Mother. Atlee is bringing Aidan to the Dutch, who believe his pure blood will cure them. Aidan attempts to overpower Atlee, but Atlee is stronger and drains him of blood. On the way to the Dutch, Atlee, not cured, turns to dust. The car crashes, and Aidan is ejected. As he lies on the ground in pain, visions of Josh and Sally tell him maybe it is his time to die, but he resolves to fight through the pain and live. Elsewhere, Donna performs an incantation in the woods, leading her to where Josh and Nora buried Ray's corpse. She asks herself what she can do with him.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 3)\n |EpisodeNumber = 28\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = (Dead) Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\n |DirectedBy = [[Adam Kane]]\n |WrittenBy = Nancy Won\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|1|21}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-47\n |Viewers = 1.17<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/01/23/monday-cable-ratingscatfish-wins-night-teen-mom-2-wwe-raw-pawn-stars-love-and-hip-hop-more/166162/|title=Monday Cable Ratings:'Catfish' Wins Night, 'Teen Mom 2', 'WWE Raw', 'Pawn Stars', 'Love and Hip Hop' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Bibel|first=Sara|date=January 23, 2013|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Liam McLean finds his son Connor's corpse mounted in the Dutch stronghold, kills them all, and vows to find his son's murderer. He turns up at the storage unit where Nora is about to lock herself in for the full moon and questions her about Connor and Brynn, then locks himself in with her so they can turn together and he can better judge her truthfulness. At the brownstone, Josh and Sally see Nick and Stevie off on their new lives, and get a call from Aidan, who is surprised that Sally is corporeal and Josh is no longer a werewolf. Josh takes Sally for a night on the town, and reveals he intends to propose to Nora. An old high school friend, Trent, recognizes Sally, though Donna had warned her to see no one from her past. She tells him she faked her death to escape Danny, they hit it off, and later Sally takes him home, but he feels an apprehension he cannot explain, and leaves. Aidan needs blood, and his old source Tracy, who now carries the vampire-killing flu virus, sends him to the black market for pure blood, but the werewolves who have taken over Boston entrap him. Henry appears, saves him, and brings him home to feed on his girlfriend Emma who is infection-free. Aidan realizes that Emma is under compulsion, and refuses to feed. Later an angry Henry discovers that Aidan has let Emma escape, as Aidan promises they will find a new way to survive. At the brownstone the next morning Josh and Sally hear sirens outside, and see Trent's lifeless body being loaded into a body bag. The reason for Donna's warning is now apparent; if Sally sees someone from her past life, they die.

Aidan and Henry hunt for clean blood. Josh refuses to identify flu-free patients for them, but changes his mind. A patient file piques his interest. The patient, Erin, tells Josh she was scratched by a strange dog during the last full moon, and Josh realizes she was attacked by a werewolf and will turn on the next full moon only a day away. The social services worker arrives to take Erin to a foster home, but Josh and Nora claim she has been abused and must stay at the hospital. They decide to take her in and tell her the truth. She doesn't believe it at first, but Josh convinces her with a video of his transformation. Josh gives Aidan the address of a flu-free patient, and he and Henry track the man down. Struggling with an over-eager Henry, Aidan sees a tell tale sign that Henry has ingested virus-tainted blood. He invites Henry to drink his untainted blood, but Henry refuses, saying everyone who Aidan loves ends up dead, and goes off to die alone. Sally, upset over Trent's death, heads to the funeral home where Trent is being prepared for his funeral service, and tries to help his ghost get his Door. He thinks his fianc\u00e9e Candice needs to be told about his infidelity, so Sally tells Candice, only for Candice to reveal she has been cheating on Trent for a year. Candice feels better, however Trent is still without his Door. Max, the undertaker, tells Sally he admires her for bringing comfort to Candice; Sally finds him charming. In the woods, Nora and Erin prepare to turn, with Josh for support. When she turns, Erin tries to attack Josh, who holds his ground until Nora transforms and puts Erin in her place. At the funeral home, Trent finally sees his Door appear. He passes through only to find himself in Donna's soup kitchen. Donna says she is happy to have her \"first delivery\", and that it took awhile for Sally to give in to the urge to see someone from her past. Trent is incredulous that he will spend eternity in the kitchen, but Donna says he will in fact not spend eternity anywhere, and uses an iron meat cleaver to slice through his spirit, turning it to a pile of dust.

The following morning, Nora tells Josh she will be spending the evening at her parents'. When Aidan wakes up, Josh reprimands him for the party, and wants to talk about Henry, but Aidan says he is fine, and no longer needs Josh's help in finding clean blood. Josh wants Aidan to get his job back, since they are strapped for cash after raising Sally from the dead, sending money to Ray's wife and son, and getting a new car after Erin destroyed the old one, but Aidan isn't ready. Sally awakes from a nightmare where people from her past recognize her and die, and talking with Erin she expresses the desire for a new identity. That night, Aidan takes Sally out on the town to a tough bar where he knows no one will know her, also hoping to find a new victim. At the bar, Sally quizzes Aidan and discovers vampires who wish to acquire new identities often assume those of dead children. Aidan ditches Sally to attack a burly biker, leaving him for dead. At Nora's family home Josh meets her father Robert, younger brother R.J., and mother Lynette. Both Josh and Erin, brought along so they can keep an eye on her, notice something off about the family. Alone, Nora reveals to Josh that she killed Brynn after they fought. Josh forgives her, and later asks Robert's permission to marry Nora. Back at the house, Aidan dreams about everyone he has lost, and awakes to find Sally holding a stake to his heart. Holding back tears, she asks why he has a death wish when he finally has all he wanted, and he admits that he has been selfish. He regains his resolve, and signs up at the hospital for nursing duty. R.J. arrives at the brownstone, drunk, telling Nora about Josh's wish to marry her, but she doesn't believe it, and leaves to get coffee to sober him up.

Sally seems to dump Max and quit her job, but then wakes up to discover that it was Linda, who had taken over her body.

Aidan believes his cure is the result of drinking Josh's werewolf blood two years prior and Erin's blood during the assassination attempt. He later offers Blake the cure, stressing that only enough blood should be taken so both live, if she promises that Kenny, Josh and Nora are off limits to the vampires. Later that night, Blake lays a trap with dozens of other vampires who plan to drink from a werewolf to cure the virus. Aidan recalls Suzanna imploring him to pursue love, should he find it in the future. He goes to the university to see Kat, embracing and kissing her passionately. And Zoe comes home to see Nick eating a recently killed cat.

Aidan wakes up in a gutter, barefoot. Zoe tells Sally she killed Nick in self-defense. Nick's ghost returns and warns Zoe against Sally, as his Door, emblazoned with a gilded clamshell, appears. He passes through, and Zoe asks Sally to stay away. Aidan has a flashback to church, with Reverend Herring publicly implies that God doesn't wish Aidan and Suzanna to have a child because of darkness in their hearts. Back in the present day, Kat takes Aidan to Boston's rare book archive to show him the book \"Days on the Charles\", by Edmund Waite (his father) since he mentioned Corwich in his fever dreams. Aidan nearly lets it slip that the author is indeed his father, but their attention is soon drawn to Jeff Westin, Kat's ex-boyfriend and former college professor who has brought along his newest girlfriend, Marissa. Later at Kat's house, Aidan and Kat become intimate. Sally and Josh find Stevie at his parents' house. At first he claims he ran out of money and came home, and that his family is away, but when Josh finds a severed arm in the breadbox, Stevie admits his parents died as a result of seeing him, and he's been eating their dead corpses, but the arm in the breadbox is the mailman's. Stevie asks for help him kill himself, as he has tried and failed. Eventually Josh, knowing that he is too far-gone, tells Sally to leave and does the deed. Stevie's ghost arrives to thank them. His Door appears and Sally sees the same gilded clamshell and realizes something is wrong since ghosts' Doors are never the same, but Stevie passes through before she can stop him. Josh arrives at the RV to find Pete being attacked by vampires seeking the blood cure. Josh tries to save him and is almost killed, but Pete calls out Josh's name, and recognizing it they leave him alone.

Kenny tells Aidan to turn him now or he will leave the hospital on his own. Aidan reluctantly agrees and they go for a pleasant afternoon in the sunshine, and then go to the brownstone. Josh, Nora, and Sally go to Donna's, but when they get there the soup kitchen has disappeared completely. With everything falling apart around them, Nora suggests to Josh that they get married soon before Sally dies. Josh's sister Emily takes Josh, Kenny, and Aidan to a strip club for Josh's bachelor party. A figure watches Aidan from across the room. A stripper, Sadie, gives Josh a lap dance in a private room, but she turns out to be a vampire seeking Josh's werewolf blood, and Aidan stakes her through the heart. Emily and Kenny see the whole thing, and Josh reveals the truth about their natures. Emily, upset, storms off. With Kenny resting after Aidan's bite, Josh and Aidan reconcile their differences. Aidan tells Sally that Ilana Myers may know how to fight Donna, and allows Sally to eat his flesh to satisfy her hunger by taking a bite from his stomach. Ilana thinks the clamshell Door must lead to somewhere on Earth rather than to the next world, and that Sally will not be able to escape it either, though once she passes through she may be able to fight back. Sally is reluctant, but Ilana says she must be very powerful, since she has survived an exorcism, and come back from the dead bringing two souls back with her. Ilana grabs an old book off of a shelf, asks how good Sally is at Latin, and prepares her to learn some magic of her own. Aidan leaves the house, still sore from Sally's bite, when the hooded figure from the strip club attacks him. After a fight, Aidan manages to stake the other man, a disfigured vampire. As he crumbles away, he asks why Aidan has done this to him, and Aidan realizes the vampire is Kat's ex-boyfriend Jeff Westin. Ray wakes Ilana, seeking to know what she has told Sally. Ilana attempts to banish the spirit from Ray's body, but Ray snaps her neck saying that Ilana picked the losing side in the fight.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 3)\n |EpisodeNumber = 38\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 12\n |Title = Always a Bridesmaid, Never Alive\n |DirectedBy = Stefan Pleszczynski\n |WrittenBy = Lisa Randolph\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|4|1}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-57\n |Viewers = 1.12<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/04/02/monday-cable-ratings-wwe-raw-wins-night-teen-mom-2-bates-motel-dallas-being-human-love-and-hip-hop-more/175916/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'WWE Raw' Wins Night, 'Teen Mom 2', 'Bates Motel', 'Dallas', 'Being Human', 'Love and Hip Hop' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Bibel|first=Sara|date=April 2, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2013}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = It's Josh & Nora's wedding day.

It is only a few moments later that she feels herself awake, a ghost once more. Aiden pulls the heart from Sally's corpse, believing it will be the perfect weapon to use against Donna's black magic. Josh says his goodbyes to Nora, as the three friends go through the clamshell Door. They awake in what appears to be the soup kitchen, but Josh can see Sally perfectly, as they are now in some alternate pocket dimension that Donna calls home. Donna has brought Ray to protect her; Josh battles the wolf while Aiden and Sally confront Donna, with Sally reciting the incantation she got from Ilana; while it does have some effect, Donna reveals it was only a \"true face\" spell. Josh manages to behead Ray, killing him once and for all. Donna is starving and prepares to eat Sally's spirit, while commending her on fighting back. Aidan throws Sally's heart into a flame Donna has made, and it begins to immolate Donna. However, Donna uses the flames to return the source of the magical pain to Sally, whose spirit goes up in flames. Sally says she loves Aidan and Josh before Donna uses a cleaver to disperse her spirit, ingesting the dust it has left behind. Gloating over her victory, Donna radiates a bright light; then screams in agony and suddenly Josh, Aidan, and Sally's spirit are back in the bedroom, and they realize they have won. Josh says that they should postpone the wedding until after the full moon so he can properly see Sally, but Emily arrives, having come to terms with the gang's supernatural nature, and insists they have the wedding that day as planned.

Back at the house, Kenny has woken up, screaming in terror at what he has become. Kat discovers Sally's corpse and runs away. Aiden confesses to Sally he has long wanted a family, in part due to what happened to his wife and son (shown in flashbacks).

Josh and Nora escape, burning the vampires away, and arrive just in time to stop Liam, but Aiden is the one to kill him, which will leave Josh a wolf forever.

In Limbo, Sally, Nick and Stevie have been trying unsuccessfully to escape Limbo's version of the brownstone when finally Donna's spell releases them. Sally awakes in her human body, fearing that her friends may have woken in their coffins. Elsewhere, Aidan, underground in his coffin, is rescued by Atlee, who reveals that an influenza virus not deadly to humans has killed almost all vampires, including Mother. Atlee is bringing Aidan to the Dutch, who believe his pure blood will cure them. Aidan attempts to overpower Atlee, but Atlee is stronger and drains him of blood. On the way to the Dutch, Atlee, not cured, turns to dust. The car crashes, and Aidan is ejected.

At the brownstone, Josh and Sally see Nick and Stevie off on their new lives, and get a call from Aidan, who is surprised that Sally is corporeal and Josh is no longer a werewolf. Josh takes Sally for a night on the town, and reveals he intends to propose to Nora. An old high school friend, Trent, recognizes Sally, though Donna had warned her to see no one from her past. She tells him she faked her death to escape Danny, they hit it off, and later Sally takes him home, but he feels an apprehension he cannot explain, and leaves. Aidan needs blood, and his old source Tracy, who now carries the vampire-killing flu virus, sends him to the black market for pure blood, but the werewolves who have taken over Boston entrap him.

Sally awakes from a nightmare where people from her past recognize her and die, and talking with Erin she expresses the desire for a new identity. That night, Aidan takes Sally out on the town to a tough bar where he knows no one will know her, also hoping to find a new victim. At the bar, Sally quizzes Aidan and discovers vampires who wish to acquire new identities often assume those of dead children. Aidan ditches Sally to attack a burly biker, leaving him for dead.

He suffers a seizure, bleeding from his eyes and mouth, and Josh and Sally believe it is the end. However next morning, they are all surprised to find that he is healthy.

Later at Kat's house, Aidan and Kat become intimate. Sally and Josh find Stevie at his parents' house. At first he claims he ran out of money and came home, and that his family is away, but when Josh finds a severed arm in the breadbox, Stevie admits his parents died as a result of seeing him, and he's been eating their dead corpses, but the arm in the breadbox is the mailman's. Stevie asks for help him kill himself, as he has tried and failed. Eventually Josh, knowing that he is too far-gone, tells Sally to leave and does the deed. Stevie's ghost arrives to thank them.

Emily and Kenny see the whole thing, and Josh reveals the truth about their natures. Emily, upset, storms off. With Kenny resting after Aidan's bite, Josh and Aidan reconcile their differences. Aidan tells Sally that Ilana Myers may know how to fight Donna, and allows Sally to eat his flesh to satisfy her hunger by taking a bite from his stomach. Ilana thinks the clamshell Door must lead to somewhere on Earth rather than to the next world, and that Sally will not be able to escape it either, though once she passes through she may be able to fight back. Sally is reluctant, but Ilana says she must be very powerful, since she has survived an exorcism, and come back from the dead bringing two souls back with her. Ilana grabs an old book off of a shelf, asks how good Sally is at Latin, and prepares her to learn some magic of her own.
