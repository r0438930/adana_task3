It lies 12&nbsp;km southeast of [[Kufstein]] and 9&nbsp;km west of [[Sankt Johann in Tirol]].  It is located at an elevation of 820 m above [[sea level]]. It was mentioned for the first time in the records in 1155 and is nowadays part of the [[SkiWelt|Ski Welt]] skiing area.\n\nEllmau is in very picturesque alpine countryside famed for its proximity to the [[Kaisergebirge|Wilder Kaiser]] mountains and the steep wooded and meadowed hills to the south.\nThe village is a very popular holiday resort both in winter and summer. In winter a variety of winter sports are possible on the local pistes and, in summer, the area is ideal for walking, mountain biking and climbing.\n\n==Lifts==\nThe adjacent hills to the south of Ellmau have several lifts and a brand new gondola ascending them (which replaced the funicular) .<ref>http://www.skiwelt@at {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107211136/http://www02.at/ |date=2014-01-07 }}</ref> In the winter several [[Surface lift|Drag Lifts]] are in operation for skiers going into the lower stage of hills, in addition to smaller nursery slope lifts. The main lifts are open in both summer and winter. The Astberg is located about 1.5&nbsp;km east from the village, it is a 4-person chair lift going to the top of the Astberg, where there is a cafe. About 2&nbsp;km to the west of the Village is the Hartkaiser heated gondola  which ascends the Hartkaiser taking around 7 minutes.<ref>http://www.skiwelt@at {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107211136/http://www02.at/ |date=2014-01-07 }}</ref> The funicular car has now been placed at the top of the slopes as a monument to the former lift.
