However, \"[i]t is ... possible ... that an early European visitor, whose knowledge of [Kiswahili] was not extensive, changed ''mlima'' to ''kilima'' by analogy with the two [[Chaga languages|Wachagga]] names: ''Kibo'' and ''Kimawenzi''.\"<ref name=\"Hutchinson\"/> A different approach is to assume that the kileman part of Kilimanjaro comes from the Kichagga ''kileme'', which means that which defeats, or ''kilelema'', which means that which has become difficult or impossible. The jaro part would \"then be derived from ''njaare'', a bird; or, according to other informants, a leopard; or, possibly from ''jyaro'', a caravan\". Considering that the name Kilimanjaro has never been current among the [[Chaga people|Wachagga people]], it is possible that the name was derived from Wachagga saying that the mountain was unclimbable, ''kilemanjaare'' or ''kilemajyaro'', and porters misinterpreting this as being the name of the mountain.<ref name=\"Hutchinson\"/>\n\nIn the 1880s, the mountain became a part of [[German East Africa]] and was called Kilima-Ndscharo in German following the Kiswahili name components.<ref>Briggs, Philip (1996): \"Guide to Tanzania; 2nd edition.\" Bradt Guides.</ref> On 6 October 1889, [[Hans Meyer (geologist)|Hans Meyer]] reached the highest summit on the crater ridge of Kibo.

The people became angry at Tone, forcing him to flee. Nobody wanted to protect him but a solitary dweller who had stones that turned miraculously into cattle. The dweller bid that Tone never open the stable of the cattle. When Tone did not heed the warning and the cattle escaped, Tone followed them, but the fleeing cattle threw up hills to run on, including Mawenzi and Kibo. Tone finally collapsed on Kibo, ending the pursuit.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAnother legend has it that Kibo and Mawenzi were good neighbours, until Mawenzi played a prank on Kibo and threw away embers he had received from Kibo and claimed that they had burned out. Kibo eventually got angry and beat Mawenzi badly, explaining why the mountain is so badly degraded. This theory explains Mawenzi's name as \"the Battered\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} -->\nA legend tells of ivory-filled graves of elephants on the mountain, and of a cow named Rayli that produces miraculous fat from her tail glands.

The problem with this assumption is that ''kilima'' actually means hill and is, therefore, the [[diminutive]] of ''mlima'', the proper Kiswahili word for mountain. However, \"[i]t is ... possible ... that an early European visitor, whose knowledge of [Kiswahili] was not extensive, changed ''mlima'' to ''kilima'' by analogy with the two [[Chaga languages|Wachagga]] names: ''Kibo'' and ''Kimawenzi''.\"<ref name=\"Hutchinson\"/> A different approach is to assume that the kileman part of Kilimanjaro comes from the Kichagga ''kileme'', which means that which defeats, or ''kilelema'', which means that which has become difficult or impossible. The jaro part would \"then be derived from ''njaare'', a bird; or, according to other informants, a leopard; or, possibly from ''jyaro'', a caravan\". Considering that the name Kilimanjaro has never been current among the [[Chaga people|Wachagga people]], it is possible that the name was derived from Wachagga saying that the mountain was unclimbable, ''kilemanjaare'' or ''kilemajyaro'', and porters misinterpreting this as being the name of the mountain.<ref name=\"Hutchinson\"/>\n\nIn the 1880s, the mountain became a part of [[German East Africa]] and was called Kilima-Ndscharo in German following the Kiswahili name components.<ref>Briggs, Philip (1996): \"Guide to Tanzania; 2nd edition.\" Bradt Guides.</ref> On 6 October 1889, [[Hans Meyer (geologist)|Hans Meyer]] reached the highest summit on the crater ridge of Kibo.

The dweller bid that Tone never open the stable of the cattle. When Tone did not heed the warning and the cattle escaped, Tone followed them, but the fleeing cattle threw up hills to run on, including Mawenzi and Kibo. Tone finally collapsed on Kibo, ending the pursuit.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAnother legend has it that Kibo and Mawenzi were good neighbours, until Mawenzi played a prank on Kibo and threw away embers he had received from Kibo and claimed that they had burned out. Kibo eventually got angry and beat Mawenzi badly, explaining why the mountain is so badly degraded. This theory explains Mawenzi's name as \"the Battered\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} -->\nA legend tells of ivory-filled graves of elephants on the mountain, and of a cow named Rayli that produces miraculous fat from her tail glands.
