[[Pakistan]] geologically overlaps both with the [[Indian Plate|Indian]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] where its [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] provinces lie on the north-western corner of the Indian plate while [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and most of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] lie within the Eurasian plate which mainly comprises the [[Iranian Plateau]]. [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] and [[Azad Kashmir]] lie along the edge of the Indian plate and hence are prone to violent [[earthquake]]s where the two tectonic plates collide.\n\nPakistan is bordered by [[India]] to the east, [[Afghanistan]] to the northwest and [[Iran]] to the west while [[China]] borders the country in the northeast. The nation is geopolitically placed within some of the most controversial regional boundaries which share disputes and have many-a-times escalated military tensions between the nations, e.g., that of [[Kashmir]] with India and the [[Durand Line]] with Afghanistan. Its western borders include the [[Khyber Pass]] and [[Bolan Pass]] that have served as traditional migration routes between Central [[Eurasia]] and [[South Asia]].\n\nAt {{convert|881,913|km2}}, Pakistan is the 33rd largest country by area, little more than twice the size of the US state of [[California]], and slightly larger than the Canadian province of [[Alberta]]. {{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==International boundaries==\n[[Image:Pakistan 2002 CIA map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|International and provincial boundaries of Pakistan]]\n[[Image:Pakistan relief location map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|International boundaries of Pakistani terrain]]\nPakistan shares its borders with four neighboring countries \u2013 [[People's Republic of China]], [[Afghanistan]], [[India]], and [[Iran]] while [[Tajikistan]] is separated by thin [[Wakhan Corridor]]\u2013 adding up to about {{convert|6975|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} in length (excluding the coastal areas).\n\nPakistan borders Afghanistan at the [[Durand Line]], {{convert|2430|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, which runs from the [[Hindu Kush]] and the [[Pamir Mountains]]. A narrow strip of Afghanistan territory called the [[Wakhan Corridor]] extends between Pakistan and [[Tajikistan]]. From the eastern tip of the Wakhan Corridor starts the Sino-Pak border between the [[People's Republic of China]] and Pakistan spanning about {{convert|510|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. It carries on south-eastward and ends near the [[Karakoram Pass]]. This line was determined from 1961 to 1965 in a series of agreements between China and Pakistan and finally on 03-03-1963 both the governments, of [[Islamabad]] and [[Beijing]], formally agreed. It is understood that if the dispute over Kashmir is resolved, the border would need to be discussed again.<ref name=\"CITEREFPakistanGeography\">{{cite web\n|url=http://countrystudies.us/pakistan/23.htm\n|title=Pakistan: Geography\n|publisher=US Country Studies\n|accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref>\n\nThe boundary with [[Iran]], {{convert|909|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, was first delimited by a British commission in the same year as the Durand Line was demarcated, separating Iran from what was then British India's [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]] province.<ref name=\"CITEREFPakistanGeography\"/> Modern Iran has a province named [[Sistan va Baluchistan]] that borders Pakistan and has [[Baloch people|Baluchis]] in an ethnic majority. In 1957 Pakistan signed a frontier agreement with Iran in [[Rawalpindi]] according to which the border was officially declared and the two countries haven't had this border as a subject of serious dispute at all.\n<!--[[Image:Earthquake Information for Pakistan.gif|thumb|Map depicting tectonic plates shows Indian and Eurasian tectonic plate divide throughout Pakistan and Kashmir where earthquake activity is common.]]-->\nThe [[Northern Areas]] has five of the world's seventeen highest [[mountain|peaks]] along with highest range of mountains the [[Karakoram]] and [[Himalayas]]. It also has such extensive [[glacier]]s that it has sometimes been called the \"[[Siachen Glacier|Third Pole]]\". The international border-line has been a matter of pivotal dispute between Pakistan and India ever since 1947, and the [[Siachen Glacier]] in northern Kashmir has been an important arena for fighting between the two sides since 1984, although far more soldiers have died of exposure to the cold than from any skirmishes in the conflict between their National Armies facing each other.\n\nThe Pakistan-India [[ceasefire]] [[border|line]] runs from the Karakoram Pass west-southwest to a point about 130 kilometers northwest of Lahore. This line, about 770 kilometers long, was arranged with [[United Nations]] (UNO) assistance at the end of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947\u201348. The ceasefire line came into effect on January 1, 1949, after eighteen months of fighting between Indian forces and Pakistani forces and was last adjusted and agreed upon by the two countries according to the [[Shimla Agreement]] of July 2, 1972 between [[Indira Gandhi]] and [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. Since then, it has been generally known as the Line of Control or the (LoC).\n\nThe [[India\u2013Pakistan border]] continues irregularly southward for about 1,280 kilometers, following the [[Radcliffe line]], named for Sir [[Cyril Radcliffe, 1st Viscount Radcliffe|Cyril Radcliffe]], the head of the British Boundary Commission on the division of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] provinces of [[British India]] on 13 August 1947.\n\nThe southern borders are far less contentious than those in northern Pakistan (Kashmir). The Thar Desert in the province of [[Sindh]] is separated in the south from the salt flats of the Rann of Kachchh (Kutch) by a boundary that was first delineated in 1923\u201324. After independence and dissolution of Empire, Independent and free Pakistan contested the southern boundary of Sindh, and a succession of border incidents resulted. They were less dangerous and less widespread, however, than the conflict that erupted in Kashmir in the Indo-Pakistani War of August 1965 started with this decisive core of issues. These southern hostilities were ended by British mediation during Harold Wilson's era, and both sides accepted the award of the Indo-Pakistan Western Boundary Case Tribunal designated by the UN secretary general himself. The tribunal made its award on February 19, 1968; delimiting a line of 403 kilometers that was later demarcated by joint survey teams, Of its original claim of some 9,100 square kilometers, Pakistan was awarded only about 780 square kilometers. Beyond the western terminus of the tribunal's award, the final stretch of Pakistan's border with India is about 80 kilometers long, running east and southeast of Sindh to an inlet of the [[Arabian Sea]].\n\n===Maritime claims===\n;Contiguous zone\n:{{convert|12|nmi}}\n;Continental shelf\n:{{convert|200|nmi}}, or to the edge of the [[continental margin]]\n;[[Exclusive economic zone]]\n:{{convert|290,000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}\n;Territorial sea\n:{{convert|12|nmi}}\n\n{{Borders of Pakistan}}\n\n==Geographical regions==\n[[Image:Pakistan Topography.png|thumb|Topography of Pakistan]]\nPakistan is divided into three major geographic areas: the northern highlands; the [[Indus River]] plain, with two major subdivisions corresponding roughly to the provinces of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]]; and the Balochistan [[Plateau]]. Some geographers designate additional major regions. For example, the mountain ranges along the western border with [[Afghanistan]] are sometimes described separately from the Balochistan Plateau, and on the eastern border with India, south of the [[Sutlej River]], the [[Thar Desert]] may be considered separately from the Indus Plain. Nevertheless, the country may conveniently be visualized in general terms as divided in three by an imaginary line drawn eastward from the [[Khyber Pass]] and another drawn southwest from [[Islamabad]] down the middle of the country. Roughly, then, the northern highlands are north of the imaginary east-west line; the Balochistan Plateau is to the west of the imaginary southwest line; and the Indus Plain lies to the east of that line.\n\n===The northern highlands===\nThe northern highlands include parts of the Hindu Kush, the [[Karakoram]] Range, and the [[Himalayas]]. This area includes such famous peaks as [[K2]]<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic-art/312055/69374/K2-in-the-Karakoram-Range-northern-Baltistan-Northern-Areas-Pak K2] \u2013 Britannica.com</ref> (Mount Godwin Austen, at 8,611 meters the second highest peak in the world). More than one-half of the summits are over 4,500 meters, and more than fifty peaks reach above 6,500 meters. Travel through the area is difficult and dangerous, although the government is attempting to develop certain areas into tourist and trekking sites. Because of their rugged topography and the rigors of the climate, the northern highlands and the [[Himalayas]] to the east have been formidable barriers to movement into Pakistan throughout history.\n[[Image:K2 8611.jpg|thumb|[[K2]], at 8,619 metres (28,251 ft), is the world's second highest peak]]\n\nSouth of the northern highlands and west of the [[Indus River]] plain are the Safed Koh Range along the Afghanistan border and the Sulaiman Range and Kirthar Range, which define the western extent of the province of Sindh and reach almost to the southern coast. The lower reaches are far more arid than those in the north, and they branch into ranges that run generally to the southwest across the province Balochistan. North-south valleys in Balochistan and Sindh have restricted the migration of peoples along the Makran Coast on the Arabian Sea east toward the plains.\n\nSeveral large passes cut the ranges along the border with [[Afghanistan]]. Among them are the [[Khojak Pass]], about eighty kilometres northwest of Quetta in Balochistan; the Khyber Pass, forty kilometres west of [[Peshawar]] and leading to [[Kabul]]; and the [[Broghol]] Pass in the far north, providing access to the [[Wakhan Corridor]].\n\nLess than one-fifth of Pakistan's land area has the potential for intensive [[agriculture|agricultural]] use. Nearly all of the arable land is actively cultivated, but outputs are low by world standards. Cultivation is sparse in the northern mountains, the southern deserts, and the western [[plateau]]s, but the [[Indus River]] basin in Punjab and northern Sindh has [[fertility|fertile]] soil that enables Pakistan to feed its population under usual climatic conditions.\n\n===The Indus plain===\n{{Main|Indo-Gangetic plain}}\nThe name Indus comes from the Sanskrit word hindu, meaning ocean, from which also come the words Sindh, Hindu, and India. The Indus, one of the great rivers of the world, rises in southwestern [[Tibet]] only about 160 kilometres west of the source of the [[Sutlej River]], which first flows through [[Punjab, India]] and joins the [[Indus]] in [[Pakistani Punjab]], and the [[Brahmaputra]], which runs eastward before turning southwest and flowing through [[India]] and, [[Bangladesh]]. The catchment area of the Indus is estimated at almost 1 million square kilometres, and all of Pakistan's major rivers\u2014the Kabul, Jhelum, and Chenab\u2014flow into it. The Indus River basin is a large, fertile alluvial plain formed by silt from the Indus. This area has been inhabited by agricultural civilizations for at least 5,000 years.\n\n===Baluchistan===\n[[Image:NEO sulaiman big.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the Sulaiman Range]]\n{{Main|Balochistan, Pakistan}}\nBalochistan is located at the eastern edge of the Iranian plateau and in the border region between Southwest, Central, and South Asia. It is geographically the largest of the four provinces at 347,190&nbsp;km\u00b2 or (134,051 square miles) of Pakistani territory; and composes 48% of the total land area of Pakistan. The population density is very low due to the mountainous terrain and scarcity of water. The southern region is known as [[Makran]]. The central region is known as [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]].\n\nThe [[Sulaiman Mountains]] dominate the northeast corner and the Bolan Pass is a natural route into Afghanistan towards Kandahar. Much of the province south of the [[Quetta]] region is sparse desert terrain with pockets of inhabitable towns mostly near rivers and streams. The largest desert is the [[Kharan Desert]] which occupies the most of [[Kharan District]].\n\nThis area is subject to frequent [[seismology|seismic]] disturbances because the [[plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] under the Indian plate hits the plate under Eurasia as it continues to move northward and to push the Himalayas ever higher. The region surrounding Quetta is highly prone to [[earthquake]]s. A severe quake in 1931 was followed by one of more destructive force in 1935. The small city of [[Quetta]] was almost completely destroyed, and the adjacent military cantonment was heavily damaged. At least 20,000 people were killed. Tremors continue in the vicinity of [[Quetta]]; the most recent major [[october 2005 kashmir earthquake|earthquake]] in which nearly 10,0000 people died and [[2008 Balochistan earthquake|earthquake]]<ref>Center for the Observation and Modeling of Earthquakes and Tectonics (COMET), 2005. Locating the Kashmir Fault, http://comet.nerc.ac. uk/news_kashmir.html</ref> occurred in October 2008 in which 30,000 people were killed. In January 1991 a severe earthquake destroyed entire villages in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]], but far fewer people were killed in the quake than died in 1935. A major earthquake centred in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's Kohistan District in 1965 also caused heavy damage.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Pakistan}}\n[[File:Pakistan map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Pakistan map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification zones]]\n[[Image:Pakistan.A2005097.0615.1km.jpg|thumb|Dust storm over Pakistan and surrounding countries, April 7, 2005]]\nPakistan lies in the [[temperate]] zone, immediately above the [[tropic of cancer]]. The climate varies from [[tropical]] to temperate. [[Arid]] conditions exist in the coastal south, characterized by a [[monsoon]] season with adequate rainfall and a dry season with lesser rainfall, while abundant rainfall is experienced by the province of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], and wide variations between extremes of temperature at given locations. Rainfall varies from as little as less than 10&nbsp;inches a year to over 150&nbsp;inches a year, in various parts of the nation. These generalizations should not, however, obscure the distinct differences existing among particular locations. For example, the coastal area along the Arabian Sea is usually warm, whereas the frozen snow-covered ridges of the [[Karakoram]] Range and of other mountains of the far north are so cold year round that they are only accessible by world-class climbers for a few weeks in May and June of each year.\n\nPakistan has four seasons: a cool, dry winter marked by mild temperatures from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November. The onset and duration of these seasons vary somewhat according to location.\n\nThe climate in the capital city of [[Islamabad]] varies from an average daily low of {{convert|5|\u00b0C|1}} in January to an average daily high of {{convert|40|\u00b0C}} in June. Half of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August, averaging about {{convert|300|mm|in|2}} in each of those two months. The remainder of the year has significantly less rain, amounting to about {{convert|100|mm|in|2}} per month. [[Hail]]storms are common in early spring.\n\nPakistan's largest city, [[Karachi]], which is also the country's [[Industry|industrial]] center, is more humid than Islamabad but gets significantly lesser rainfall. Only July and August average more than {{convert|50|mm|in|2}} of rainfall in the Karachi area; the remaining months are exceedingly dry with little rainfall. The temperature is also more uniform in Karachi than in Islamabad, ranging from an average daily low of {{convert|13|\u00b0C|1}} during winter evenings to an average daily high of {{convert|34|\u00b0C|1}} on summer days. Although the summer temperatures do not get as high as those in Punjab, the high humidity causes the residents a great deal of discomfort.\n\n===Water resources===\n{{Main|Water resources management in Pakistan}}\n{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Pakistan}}\nHydrological power is a renewable resource which benefits Pakistan a lot. After the Indus Water Treaty on 1960 World Bank decided that River Sutlej, Ravi and Beas water will be used by India and River Indus, Jhelum and Chenab water will be used by Pakistan. Pakistan was told to build two dams, one tarbela and second Mangla, five barrages, eight link canals, and one gated siphon. For this, India was told to participate 60%, whereas Pakistan, 40%. Pakistan is considering to develop wind turbines to fulfill the demand for electricity. Solar power is now slowly flourishing but it is still installed on a small scale.\n \nPakistan largest river is known as the Indus River which flows from Tibet/China and enters Pakistan through Gilgit Baltistan. The Indus River system is divided into two plains. The Upper Indus Plain starts from northern Pakistan and ends up at Mithankot. The Indus has tributaries on both western and eastern side. The Indus' eastern tributaries are the Jhelum, Chenab, Sutlej, Ravi and Beas. These four rivers flow in Punjab and meet at Panjnad where they are known as Panjnad river. The Indus' western tributaries are the Swat, Kabul, Kurrram, Tochi, Gomal, Zhob rivers. These rivers join the Indus at KPK. At Mithankot these rivers finally meet with the River Indus. After this the Indus flows alone through the Lower Indus Plain. Lower Indus Plain starts from Mithankot up to Thatta where the Indus meets with the Arabian Sea. This place is also known as Indus Delta.\n\n===Fuel resources===\n{{Main|Fuel extraction in Pakistan}}\nPakistan has extensive energy resources, including fairly sizable [[natural gas]] reserves, [[petroleum]] oil reserves, [[coal]] fields and large [[hydropower]] potential.\n\n===Agriculture===\n{{Main|Agriculture in Pakistan}}\nAbout 26% of Pakistan's total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. The most important crops are [[tobacco]], [[cotton]], [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugarcane]], [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[millets]], [[pulse]]s, [[vegetable oil|oil seeds]], [[barley]], [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s, which together account for more than 75% of the value of total crop output.<ref>Environment of Pakistan pg213.\"Major crop output\" line 13</ref>\n\n===Fishery===\n{{Main|Fishing in Pakistan}}\n[[Fishery]] and [[fishing industry]] plays an important role in the national economy of [[Pakistan]]. With a coastline of about 1046&nbsp;km, Pakistan has enough fishery resources that remain to be fully developed. It is also a major source of export earning.\n\n===Forestry===\n{{Main|Forestry in Pakistan}}\nAbout only 4.1% of land in Pakistan is covered with forests. The forests of Pakistan are a main source of food, [[lumber]], [[paper]], [[fuel wood]], [[latex]], [[medicinal plant|medicine]] as well as used for purposes of [[wildlife]] conservation and [[Eco tourism]].\n\n===Mining===\n{{Main|Mining in Pakistan}}\nThe Salt Range in the [[Potwar Plateau]] has large deposits of [[rock salt]]. Pakistan has extensive mineral resources, including fairly sizable reserves of [[gypsum]], [[limestone]], [[chromite]]s, [[iron ore]], [[halite|rock salt]], [[silver]], [[gold]], precious stones, [[gemstone|gem]]s, [[marble]]s, [[tile]]s, [[copper]], [[sulfur]], [[fire clay]] and silica sand.\n\n==Environment and conservation==\n{{Main|Environmental issues in Pakistan}}\nThe environmental issues is a great problem for the nature and nation of Pakistan and has been disturbing the balance between economic development and environmental protection. As Pakistan is a large importer of both exhaustible and renewable natural resources and a large consumer of [[fossil fuel]]s, the Ministry of Environment of [[Government of Pakistan]] takes responsibility to conserve and [[Environmentalism|protect the environment]].\n\n'''Current issues''': water pollution from raw sewage, industrial wastes, and agricultural runoff; limited natural fresh water resources; a majority of the population does not have access to potable water; [[deforestation]]; [[soil erosion]]; [[desertification]].\n\n===Natural disasters===\n{{Main|List of natural disasters in Pakistan}}\nPakistan is subject to frequent [[earthquake]]s which are often severe (especially in north and west) and severe [[flood]]ing along the Indus after heavy rains (July and August). [[Landslide]]s are common in the northern mountains.\n\n===Protected areas===\n{{Main|Protected areas of Pakistan}}\nThere are 15 [[National Parks|national parks]], 72 [[Wildlife Sanctuary|wildlife sanctuaries]], 66 [[game reserve]]s, 9 marine and littoral protected areas, 19 protected [[Ramsar convention|wetlands]] and a number of other protected [[grassland]]s, [[shrubland]]s, [[woodland]]s and [[natural monument]]s.\n\n===International agreements===\nPakistan is a party to several international agreements related to environment and climate, the most prominent among them are:\n\n{| width=\"100%\" bgcolor=\"#fff4f4\"\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"|Treaties and Agreements\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| Specific Regions and [[Sea]]s\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small> [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]], Ship Pollution ([[MARPOL 73/78]])</small>\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| [[Earth's atmosphere|Atmosphere]] and [[Climate]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small>[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol|Ozone Layer Protection]], [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|Nuclear Test Ban]]</small>\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| [[Biodiversity]], [[environment (biophysical)|Environment]], and [[Forest]]s\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small>[[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Desertification]], [[CITES|Endangered Species]], [[Environmental Modification Convention|Environmental Modification]], [[Ramsar Convention|Wetland]]s, [[Convention on Fishing and Conservation of Living Resources of the High Seas|Marine Life Conservation]]</small>\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| [[Waste]]s\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small>[[Basel Convention|Hazardous Wastes]]</small>\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| [[River]]s\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small>[[Indus Waters Treaty]]</small>\n|}\n\n== Suffix of regions and towns ==\nParts of region and settlement names:\n\n* [[-abad]] ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|  \u0640 \u0622\u0628\u0627\u062f }}}}) means settled place.

[[Pakistan]] geologically overlaps both with the [[Indian Plate|Indian]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] where its [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] provinces lie on the north-western corner of the Indian plate while [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and most of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] lie within the Eurasian plate which mainly comprises the [[Iranian Plateau]]. [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] and [[Azad Kashmir]] lie along the edge of the Indian plate and hence are prone to violent [[earthquake]]s where the two tectonic plates collide.\n\nPakistan is bordered by [[India]] to the east, [[Afghanistan]] to the northwest and [[Iran]] to the west while [[China]] borders the country in the northeast. The nation is geopolitically placed within some of the most controversial regional boundaries which share disputes and have many-a-times escalated military tensions between the nations, e.g., that of [[Kashmir]] with India and the [[Durand Line]] with Afghanistan. Its western borders include the [[Khyber Pass]] and [[Bolan Pass]] that have served as traditional migration routes between Central [[Eurasia]] and [[South Asia]].\n\nAt {{convert|881,913|km2}}, Pakistan is the 33rd largest country by area, little more than twice the size of the US state of [[California]], and slightly larger than the Canadian province of [[Alberta]]. {{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==International boundaries==\n[[Image:Pakistan 2002 CIA map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|International and provincial boundaries of Pakistan]]\n[[Image:Pakistan relief location map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|International boundaries of Pakistani terrain]]\nPakistan shares its borders with four neighboring countries \u2013 [[People's Republic of China]], [[Afghanistan]], [[India]], and [[Iran]] while [[Tajikistan]] is separated by thin [[Wakhan Corridor]]\u2013 adding up to about {{convert|6975|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} in length (excluding the coastal areas).\n\nPakistan borders Afghanistan at the [[Durand Line]], {{convert|2430|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, which runs from the [[Hindu Kush]] and the [[Pamir Mountains]]. A narrow strip of Afghanistan territory called the [[Wakhan Corridor]] extends between Pakistan and [[Tajikistan]]. From the eastern tip of the Wakhan Corridor starts the Sino-Pak border between the [[People's Republic of China]] and Pakistan spanning about {{convert|510|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. It carries on south-eastward and ends near the [[Karakoram Pass]]. This line was determined from 1961 to 1965 in a series of agreements between China and Pakistan and finally on 03-03-1963 both the governments, of [[Islamabad]] and [[Beijing]], formally agreed. It is understood that if the dispute over Kashmir is resolved, the border would need to be discussed again.<ref name=\"CITEREFPakistanGeography\">{{cite web\n|url=http://countrystudies.us/pakistan/23.htm\n|title=Pakistan: Geography\n|publisher=US Country Studies\n|accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref>\n\nThe boundary with [[Iran]], {{convert|909|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, was first delimited by a British commission in the same year as the Durand Line was demarcated, separating Iran from what was then British India's [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]] province.<ref name=\"CITEREFPakistanGeography\"/> Modern Iran has a province named [[Sistan va Baluchistan]] that borders Pakistan and has [[Baloch people|Baluchis]] in an ethnic majority. In 1957 Pakistan signed a frontier agreement with Iran in [[Rawalpindi]] according to which the border was officially declared and the two countries haven't had this border as a subject of serious dispute at all.\n<!--[[Image:Earthquake Information for Pakistan.gif|thumb|Map depicting tectonic plates shows Indian and Eurasian tectonic plate divide throughout Pakistan and Kashmir where earthquake activity is common.]]-->\nThe [[Northern Areas]] has five of the world's seventeen highest [[mountain|peaks]] along with highest range of mountains the [[Karakoram]] and [[Himalayas]]. It also has such extensive [[glacier]]s that it has sometimes been called the \"[[Siachen Glacier|Third Pole]]\". The international border-line has been a matter of pivotal dispute between Pakistan and India ever since 1947, and the [[Siachen Glacier]] in northern Kashmir has been an important arena for fighting between the two sides since 1984, although far more soldiers have died of exposure to the cold than from any skirmishes in the conflict between their National Armies facing each other.\n\nThe Pakistan-India [[ceasefire]] [[border|line]] runs from the Karakoram Pass west-southwest to a point about 130 kilometers northwest of Lahore. This line, about 770 kilometers long, was arranged with [[United Nations]] (UNO) assistance at the end of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947\u201348. The ceasefire line came into effect on January 1, 1949, after eighteen months of fighting between Indian forces and Pakistani forces and was last adjusted and agreed upon by the two countries according to the [[Shimla Agreement]] of July 2, 1972 between [[Indira Gandhi]] and [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. Since then, it has been generally known as the Line of Control or the (LoC).\n\nThe [[India\u2013Pakistan border]] continues irregularly southward for about 1,280 kilometers, following the [[Radcliffe line]], named for Sir [[Cyril Radcliffe, 1st Viscount Radcliffe|Cyril Radcliffe]], the head of the British Boundary Commission on the division of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] provinces of [[British India]] on 13 August 1947.\n\nThe southern borders are far less contentious than those in northern Pakistan (Kashmir). The Thar Desert in the province of [[Sindh]] is separated in the south from the salt flats of the Rann of Kachchh (Kutch) by a boundary that was first delineated in 1923\u201324. After independence and dissolution of Empire, Independent and free Pakistan contested the southern boundary of Sindh, and a succession of border incidents resulted. They were less dangerous and less widespread, however, than the conflict that erupted in Kashmir in the Indo-Pakistani War of August 1965 started with this decisive core of issues. These southern hostilities were ended by British mediation during Harold Wilson's era, and both sides accepted the award of the Indo-Pakistan Western Boundary Case Tribunal designated by the UN secretary general himself. The tribunal made its award on February 19, 1968; delimiting a line of 403 kilometers that was later demarcated by joint survey teams, Of its original claim of some 9,100 square kilometers, Pakistan was awarded only about 780 square kilometers. Beyond the western terminus of the tribunal's award, the final stretch of Pakistan's border with India is about 80 kilometers long, running east and southeast of Sindh to an inlet of the [[Arabian Sea]].\n\n===Maritime claims===\n;Contiguous zone\n:{{convert|12|nmi}}\n;Continental shelf\n:{{convert|200|nmi}}, or to the edge of the [[continental margin]]\n;[[Exclusive economic zone]]\n:{{convert|290,000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}\n;Territorial sea\n:{{convert|12|nmi}}\n\n{{Borders of Pakistan}}\n\n==Geographical regions==\n[[Image:Pakistan Topography.png|thumb|Topography of Pakistan]]\nPakistan is divided into three major geographic areas: the northern highlands; the [[Indus River]] plain, with two major subdivisions corresponding roughly to the provinces of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]]; and the Balochistan [[Plateau]]. Some geographers designate additional major regions. For example, the mountain ranges along the western border with [[Afghanistan]] are sometimes described separately from the Balochistan Plateau, and on the eastern border with India, south of the [[Sutlej River]], the [[Thar Desert]] may be considered separately from the Indus Plain. Nevertheless, the country may conveniently be visualized in general terms as divided in three by an imaginary line drawn eastward from the [[Khyber Pass]] and another drawn southwest from [[Islamabad]] down the middle of the country. Roughly, then, the northern highlands are north of the imaginary east-west line; the Balochistan Plateau is to the west of the imaginary southwest line; and the Indus Plain lies to the east of that line.\n\n===The northern highlands===\nThe northern highlands include parts of the Hindu Kush, the [[Karakoram]] Range, and the [[Himalayas]]. This area includes such famous peaks as [[K2]]<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic-art/312055/69374/K2-in-the-Karakoram-Range-northern-Baltistan-Northern-Areas-Pak K2] \u2013 Britannica.com</ref> (Mount Godwin Austen, at 8,611 meters the second highest peak in the world). More than one-half of the summits are over 4,500 meters, and more than fifty peaks reach above 6,500 meters. Travel through the area is difficult and dangerous, although the government is attempting to develop certain areas into tourist and trekking sites. Because of their rugged topography and the rigors of the climate, the northern highlands and the [[Himalayas]] to the east have been formidable barriers to movement into Pakistan throughout history.\n[[Image:K2 8611.jpg|thumb|[[K2]], at 8,619 metres (28,251 ft), is the world's second highest peak]]\n\nSouth of the northern highlands and west of the [[Indus River]] plain are the Safed Koh Range along the Afghanistan border and the Sulaiman Range and Kirthar Range, which define the western extent of the province of Sindh and reach almost to the southern coast. The lower reaches are far more arid than those in the north, and they branch into ranges that run generally to the southwest across the province Balochistan. North-south valleys in Balochistan and Sindh have restricted the migration of peoples along the Makran Coast on the Arabian Sea east toward the plains.\n\nSeveral large passes cut the ranges along the border with [[Afghanistan]]. Among them are the [[Khojak Pass]], about eighty kilometres northwest of Quetta in Balochistan; the Khyber Pass, forty kilometres west of [[Peshawar]] and leading to [[Kabul]]; and the [[Broghol]] Pass in the far north, providing access to the [[Wakhan Corridor]].\n\nLess than one-fifth of Pakistan's land area has the potential for intensive [[agriculture|agricultural]] use. Nearly all of the arable land is actively cultivated, but outputs are low by world standards. Cultivation is sparse in the northern mountains, the southern deserts, and the western [[plateau]]s, but the [[Indus River]] basin in Punjab and northern Sindh has [[fertility|fertile]] soil that enables Pakistan to feed its population under usual climatic conditions.\n\n===The Indus plain===\n{{Main|Indo-Gangetic plain}}\nThe name Indus comes from the Sanskrit word hindu, meaning ocean, from which also come the words Sindh, Hindu, and India. The Indus, one of the great rivers of the world, rises in southwestern [[Tibet]] only about 160 kilometres west of the source of the [[Sutlej River]], which first flows through [[Punjab, India]] and joins the [[Indus]] in [[Pakistani Punjab]], and the [[Brahmaputra]], which runs eastward before turning southwest and flowing through [[India]] and, [[Bangladesh]]. The catchment area of the Indus is estimated at almost 1 million square kilometres, and all of Pakistan's major rivers\u2014the Kabul, Jhelum and, Chenab\u2014flow into it. The Indus River basin is a large, fertile alluvial plain formed by silt from the Indus. This area has been inhabited by agricultural civilizations for at least 5,000 years.\n\n===Baluchistan===\n[[Image:NEO sulaiman big.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the Sulaiman Range]]\n{{Main|Balochistan, Pakistan}}\nBalochistan is located at the eastern edge of the Iranian plateau and in the border region between Southwest, Central, and South Asia. It is geographically the largest of the four provinces at 347,190&nbsp;km\u00b2 or (134,051 square miles) of Pakistani territory; and composes 48% of the total land area of Pakistan. The population density is very low due to the mountainous terrain and scarcity of water. The southern region is known as [[Makran]]. The central region is known as [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]].\n\nThe [[Sulaiman Mountains]] dominate the northeast corner and the Bolan Pass is a natural route into Afghanistan towards Kandahar. Much of the province south of the [[Quetta]] region is sparse desert terrain with pockets of inhabitable towns mostly near rivers and streams. The largest desert is the [[Kharan Desert]] which occupies the most of [[Kharan District]].\n\nThis area is subject to frequent [[seismology|seismic]] disturbances because the [[plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] under the Indian plate hits the plate under Eurasia as it continues to move northward and to push the Himalayas ever higher. The region surrounding Quetta is highly prone to [[earthquake]]s. A severe quake in 1931 was followed by one of more destructive force in 1935. The small city of [[Quetta]] was almost completely destroyed, and the adjacent military cantonment was heavily damaged. At least 20,000 people were killed. Tremors continue in the vicinity of [[Quetta]]; the most recent major [[october 2005 kashmir earthquake|earthquake]] in which nearly 10,0000 people died and [[2008 Balochistan earthquake|earthquake]]<ref>Center for the Observation and Modeling of Earthquakes and Tectonics (COMET), 2005. Locating the Kashmir Fault, http://comet.nerc.ac. uk/news_kashmir.html</ref> occurred in October 2008 in which 30,000 people were killed. In January 1991 a severe earthquake destroyed entire villages in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]], but far fewer people were killed in the quake than died in 1935. A major earthquake centred in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's Kohistan District in 1965 also caused heavy damage.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Pakistan}}\n[[File:Pakistan map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Pakistan map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification zones]]\n[[Image:Pakistan.A2005097.0615.1km.jpg|thumb|Dust storm over Pakistan and surrounding countries, April 7, 2005]]\nPakistan lies in the [[temperate]] zone, immediately above the [[tropic of cancer]]. The climate varies from [[tropical]] to temperate. [[Arid]] conditions exist in the coastal south, characterized by a [[monsoon]] season with adequate rainfall and a dry season with lesser rainfall, while abundant rainfall is experienced by the province of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], and wide variations between extremes of temperature at given locations. Rainfall varies from as little as less than 10&nbsp;inches a year to over 150&nbsp;inches a year, in various parts of the nation. These generalizations should not, however, obscure the distinct differences existing among particular locations. For example, the coastal area along the Arabian Sea is usually warm, whereas the frozen snow-covered ridges of the [[Karakoram]] Range and of other mountains of the far north are so cold year round that they are only accessible by world-class climbers for a few weeks in May and June of each year.\n\nPakistan has four seasons: a cool, dry winter marked by mild temperatures from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November. The onset and duration of these seasons vary somewhat according to location.\n\nThe climate in the capital city of [[Islamabad]] varies from an average daily low of {{convert|5|\u00b0C|1}} in January to an average daily high of {{convert|40|\u00b0C}} in June. Half of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August, averaging about {{convert|300|mm|in|2}} in each of those two months. The remainder of the year has significantly less rain, amounting to about {{convert|100|mm|in|2}} per month. [[Hail]]storms are common in early spring.\n\nPakistan's largest city, [[Karachi]], which is also the country's [[Industry|industrial]] center, is more humid than Islamabad but gets significantly lesser rainfall. Only July and August average more than {{convert|50|mm|in|2}} of rainfall in the Karachi area; the remaining months are exceedingly dry with little rainfall. The temperature is also more uniform in Karachi than in Islamabad, ranging from an average daily low of {{convert|13|\u00b0C|1}} during winter evenings to an average daily high of {{convert|34|\u00b0C|1}} on summer days. Although the summer temperatures do not get as high as those in Punjab, the high humidity causes the residents a great deal of discomfort.\n\n===Water resources===\n{{Main|Water resources management in Pakistan}}\n{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Pakistan}}\nHydrological power is a renewable resource which benefits Pakistan a lot. After the Indus Water Treaty on 1960 World Bank decided that River Sutlej, Ravi and Beas water will be used by India and River Indus, Jhelum and Chenab water will be used by Pakistan. Pakistan was told to build two dams, one tarbela and second Mangla, five barrages, eight link canals, and one gated siphon. For this, India was told to participate 60%, whereas Pakistan, 40%. Pakistan is considering to develop wind turbines to fulfill the demand for electricity. Solar power is now slowly flourishing but it is still installed on a small scale.\n \nPakistan largest river is known as the Indus River which flows from Tibet/China and enters Pakistan through Gilgit Baltistan. The Indus River system is divided into two plains. The Upper Indus Plain starts from northern Pakistan and ends up at Mithankot. The Indus has tributaries on both western and eastern side. The Indus' eastern tributaries are the Jhelum, Chenab, Sutlej, Ravi and Beas. These four rivers flow in Punjab and meet at Panjnad where they are known as Panjnad river. The Indus' western tributaries are the Swat, Kabul, Kurrram, Tochi, Gomal, Zhob rivers. These rivers join the Indus at KPK. At Mithankot these rivers finally meet with the River Indus. After this the Indus flows alone through the Lower Indus Plain. Lower Indus Plain starts from Mithankot up to Thatta where the Indus meets with the Arabian Sea. This place is also known as Indus Delta.\n\n===Fuel resources===\n{{Main|Fuel extraction in Pakistan}}\nPakistan has extensive energy resources, including fairly sizable [[natural gas]] reserves, [[petroleum]] oil reserves, [[coal]] fields and large [[hydropower]] potential.\n\n===Agriculture===\n{{Main|Agriculture in Pakistan}}\nAbout 26% of Pakistan's total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. The most important crops are [[tobacco]], [[cotton]], [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugarcane]], [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[millets]], [[pulse]]s, [[vegetable oil|oil seeds]], [[barley]], [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s, which together account for more than 75% of the value of total crop output.<ref>Environment of Pakistan pg213.\"Major crop output\" line 13</ref>\n\n===Fishery===\n{{Main|Fishing in Pakistan}}\n[[Fishery]] and [[fishing industry]] plays an important role in the national economy of [[Pakistan]]. With a coastline of about 1046&nbsp;km, Pakistan has enough fishery resources that remain to be fully developed. It is also a major source of export earning.\n\n===Forestry===\n{{Main|Forestry in Pakistan}}\nAbout only 4.1% of land in Pakistan is covered with forests. The forests of Pakistan are a main source of food, [[lumber]], [[paper]], [[fuel wood]], [[latex]], [[medicinal plant|medicine]] as well as used for purposes of [[wildlife]] conservation and [[Eco tourism]].\n\n===Mining===\n{{Main|Mining in Pakistan}}\nThe Salt Range in the [[Potwar Plateau]] has large deposits of [[rock salt]]. Pakistan has extensive mineral resources, including fairly sizable reserves of [[gypsum]], [[limestone]], [[chromite]]s, [[iron ore]], [[halite|rock salt]], [[silver]], [[gold]], precious stones, [[gemstone|gem]]s, [[marble]]s, [[tile]]s, [[copper]], [[sulfur]], [[fire clay]] and silica sand.\n\n==Environment and conservation==\n{{Main|Environmental issues in Pakistan}}\nThe environmental issues is a great problem for the nature and nation of Pakistan and has been disturbing the balance between economic development and environmental protection. As Pakistan is a large importer of both exhaustible and renewable natural resources and a large consumer of [[fossil fuel]]s, the Ministry of Environment of [[Government of Pakistan]] takes responsibility to conserve and [[Environmentalism|protect the environment]].\n\n'''Current issues''': water pollution from raw sewage, industrial wastes, and agricultural runoff; limited natural fresh water resources; a majority of the population does not have access to potable water; [[deforestation]]; [[soil erosion]]; [[desertification]].\n\n===Natural disasters===\n{{Main|List of natural disasters in Pakistan}}\nPakistan is subject to frequent [[earthquake]]s which are often severe (especially in north and west) and severe [[flood]]ing along the Indus after heavy rains (July and August). [[Landslide]]s are common in the northern mountains.\n\n===Protected areas===\n{{Main|Protected areas of Pakistan}}\nThere are 15 [[National Parks|national parks]], 72 [[Wildlife Sanctuary|wildlife sanctuaries]], 66 [[game reserve]]s, 9 marine and littoral protected areas, 19 protected [[Ramsar convention|wetlands]] and a number of other protected [[grassland]]s, [[shrubland]]s, [[woodland]]s and [[natural monument]]s.\n\n===International agreements===\nPakistan is a party to several international agreements related to environment and climate, the most prominent among them are:\n\n{| width=\"100%\" bgcolor=\"#fff4f4\"\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"|Treaties and Agreements\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| Specific Regions and [[Sea]]s\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small> [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]], Ship Pollution ([[MARPOL 73/78]])</small>\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| [[Earth's atmosphere|Atmosphere]] and [[Climate]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small>[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol|Ozone Layer Protection]], [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|Nuclear Test Ban]]</small>\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| [[Biodiversity]], [[environment (biophysical)|Environment]], and [[Forest]]s\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small>[[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Desertification]], [[CITES|Endangered Species]], [[Environmental Modification Convention|Environmental Modification]], [[Ramsar Convention|Wetland]]s, [[Convention on Fishing and Conservation of Living Resources of the High Seas|Marine Life Conservation]]</small>\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| [[Waste]]s\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small>[[Basel Convention|Hazardous Wastes]]</small>\n|-align=\"center\"\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"| [[River]]s\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|<small>[[Indus Waters Treaty]]</small>\n|}\n\n== Suffix of regions and towns ==\nParts of region and settlement names:\n\n* [[-abad]] ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|  \u0640 \u0622\u0628\u0627\u062f }}}}) means settled place.
