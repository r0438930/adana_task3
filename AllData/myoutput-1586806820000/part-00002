Blunt]] commanded the 12th during its nine months in 1863]]\n\nThe '''12th Regiment, Vermont Volunteer Infantry''' (or 12th VVI) was a nine months' infantry regiment in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. It served in the eastern theater, predominantly in the Defenses of Washington, from October 1862 to July 1863. It was a member of the [[2nd Vermont Brigade]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe 12th Vermont Infantry, a nine months regiment, raised as a result of President Lincoln's call on August 4, 1862, for additional troops due to the disastrous results of the Peninsula Campaign.\n\nIt was composed of volunteers from ten volunteer militia companies as follows:\n\n* [[West Windsor, Vermont|West Windsor]] Guards, Co. A\n* [[Woodstock, Vermont|Woodstock]] Light Infantry, Co. B\n* Howard Guard of [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], Co. C\n* July 14th, 1863 has Company G under the command of Ebenzer J. Ornisbill (spelling ?)\n* [[Tunbridge, Vermont|Tunbridge]] Light Infantry, Co. D\n* Ransom Guards of [[St. Albans (city), Vermont|St. Albans]], Co. E\n* New England Guard of [[Northfield, Vermont|Northfield]], Co. F\n* Allen Grays of [[Brandon, Vermont|Brandon]], Co. G\n* [[Bradford, Vermont|Bradford]] Guards, Co. H\n* Saxton's River Light Infantry of [[Rockingham, Vermont|Rockingham]], Co. I\n* [[Rutland (town), Vermont|Rutland]] Light Guard, Co. K\n\nColonel [[Asa P. Blunt]], previously of the [[3rd Vermont Infantry|3rd]] and [[6th Vermont Infantry|6th Vermont]] regiments, was selected to command the regiment. Lieutenant Colonel [[Roswell Farnham]] and Major Levi G. Kingsley had held commissions in the [[1st Vermont Infantry]], along with a total of 65 officers and men.\n\nThe regiment went into camp at [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]] on September 25, 1862, and was mustered into United States service on October 4. It left [[Vermont]] on October 7, and arrived in [[Washington, D.C.]] on October 10, and went into camp on East Capital Hill. On October 30 it became part of the [[2nd Vermont Brigade]], which also included the [[13th Vermont Infantry|13th]], [[14th Vermont Infantry|14th]], [[15th Vermont Infantry|15th]] and [[16th Vermont Infantry]] regiments.\n\nColonel Blunt, as ranking colonel, commanded the brigade until the arrival of Brigadier General [[Edwin H. Stoughton]], on December 7.\n\nStoughton was not popular with the officers and men of the brigade, so when he was captured by Confederate partisan [[John S. Mosby]] on March 9, 1863, few mourned his loss. Colonel Blunt assumed command of the brigade again, turning it over to the new brigade commander, Brigadier General [[George J. Stannard]], on April 20, who led the brigade until the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].\n\nThe regiment marched to [[Munson's Hill]] on October 30, and Hunting Creek the next day, where it stayed until December 12, in 'Camp Vermont.' It was engaged in picket duty near Fairfax Courthouse from December 12 to January 20, 1863, participating in a repulse of [[J.E.B. Stuart]]'s cavalry on December 29. The regiment was stationed at [[Wolf Run Shoals]] from January 20 to May 1, performed railroad guard duty at Warrenton Junction until May 7, and camped near Rappahannock Station until May 18. From then until June 1, it camped near Bristoe and Catlett's Station. For the majority of June, it was at Union Mills.\n\nOn June 25, the brigade was assigned as the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, [[I Corps (ACW)|I Corps]], and ordered to form the rear guard of the [[Army of the Potomac]] as it marched north after [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The 12th marched with the brigade from [[Wolf Run Shoals]] on June 25, crossed the Potomac river on June 27, at Edward's Ferry, and moved north through Frederick City and Creagerstown, Maryland. It was drawing near [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]] on July 1, when the 12th and 15th regiments were detached to guard the corps trains.\n\nThe regiment accompanied the corps trains to Rock Creek Church, near the battlefield, and two companies of the 12th went forward to protect ammunition trains on the Taneytown road.\n\nAfter the battle, the regiment moved south to [[Westminster, Maryland]], then served as guards for a train of 2,500 Confederate prisoners who were taken to [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. Departing Baltimore, the regiment traveled to [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], where it arrived on July 9. It was mustered out on July 14, 1863.\n\nDozens of newly discharged members of the regiment enlisted again, predominantly in the regiments of the 1st [[Vermont Brigade]], and the [[17th Vermont Infantry]].\n\n==Final Statement==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |FINAL STATEMENT\n|-\n| Original members\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 998\n|-\n| Gain (recruits and transferes)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 7\n|-\n| --- Aggregate\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 1005\n|-\n| --- Losses ---\n|-\n| Died of disease\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 63\n|-\n| Honorably discharged\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 75\n|-\n| Deserted\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 4\n|-\n| Transferred to Veteran Reserve Corps and other organizations\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 2\n|-\n| --- Total Losses\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 144\n|-\n| Mustered out at various times\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 861\n|-\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|American Civil War}}\n[[Vermont in the Civil War]]\n\n==References==\n\n* Benedict, G.
