It took place on April 27, 2008, at the [[1st Mariner Arena]] in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]. Following WrestleMania, all pay-per-views became tri-branded. It was the tenth annual event under the [[WWE Backlash|Backlash]] name and starred [[List of World Wrestling Entertainment employees|wrestler]] talents from [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], and [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brands]].\n\nEight [[Mock combat|professional wrestling matches]] were scheduled on the event's [[Card (sports)|card]], which featured a supercard, a scheduling of more than one [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]]. The first was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Fatal 4-Way elimination]] for the [[WWE Championship]] match featuring wrestlers from the Raw brand, in which all four men fought in the ring at the same time, with competitors being eliminated by [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]]. [[Triple H]] defeated WWE Champion [[Randy Orton]], [[John Cena]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] to win the championship. The other main event featured wrestlers from the SmackDown brand, in which defending [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[The Undertaker]] defeated challenger [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|standard wrestling match]], also known as a singles match. The main event from the ECW brand was a standard match in which defending [[ECW Championship|ECW Champion]] [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] defeated challenger [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]]. In addition, a featured bout was scheduled on the undercard, in which [[Shawn Michaels]] defeated [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] in a standard match.\n\nBacklash (2008) had an attendance of approximately 11,277 and received 200,000 buys, more than the [[Backlash (2007)|previous year's event]].<ref name=\"Revenue\">{{cite journal|title=World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

The match was contested for the [[WWE Championship]], featuring the champion, [[Randy Orton]], defending against [[Triple H]], [[John Cena]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] (JBL). The buildup to the match began at [[WrestleMania XXIV]], where Randy Orton defended his title against Triple H and John Cena in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]], in which the three men competed against each other, and the first man to score a pinfall or submission would win. Orton won the match, retaining the title after pinning Cena.<ref name=\"WM24-1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1206933094.shtml|title=WWE WrestleMania XXIV PPV Results \u2013 3/30/08|last=Martin|first=Adam|date=2008-03-30|publisher=WrestleView|accessdate=2009-01-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090110091532/http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1206933094.shtml| archivedate= 10 January 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"WM24-2\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/WrestleMania24/2008/03/31/5148416.html|title=Mayweather, Orton survive Mania; Edge, Flair don't|last=Plummer|first=Dave|publisher=Canoe: Slam Wrestling|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref> On the following night's episode of ''Raw'', with the WWE Championship shining on his shoulder, Randy Orton crowed about defeating both Triple H and John Cena at WrestleMania, declaring his reign as champion the \"Age of Orton\". But John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield had other ideas, telling Orton that he deserved a title match as a reward for proving that he was the toughest Superstar on Raw in his [[Hardcore wrestling|Belfast Brawl]] victory over [[Dave Finlay|Finlay]] also at WrestleMania. On the following week's episode of ''Raw'', WWE Champion Randy Orton began the night believing he would go one-on-one with JBL at Backlash, but the tide quickly turned on him. Due to Triple H's complaint about himself being [[Professional wrestling attacks#Football kick|kicked]] in the head by Orton when he was about to pin Cena to win the WWE title at Wrestlemania, [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers|General Manager]] [[Darren Matthews|William Regal]] placed Triple H into a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|Handicap match]] against Orton & JBL, and when Triple H won, Regal made the [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]] for the title. Not to be outdone, John Cena also pleaded his case to Regal, who gave him the same Handicap Match ultimatum. After Orton's intended interference failed, Cena pulled out the win, thus, the championship match at Backlash became a Fatal Four Way starring three former WWE Champions challenging Orton. On the following week's episode of ''Raw'', after his victory over William Regal, Orton felt compelled to meddle in the bout between Triple H and JBL. In an attempt at eliminating Triple H from Backlash, Orton ran in and nearly took off Triple H's head. He administered an [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|RKO]] before then teaming with JBL against him. As Orton was set to punt Triple H's noggin again, however, JBL turned on him and laid him out with a vicious [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|Clothesline From Hell]].\n\nThe main [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] heading into Backlash on the SmackDown brand was between [[The Undertaker]] and [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], over the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. In February, at [[No Way Out (2008)|No Way Out]], Undertaker won an [[Elimination Chamber]] match to become the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at [[WrestleMania XXIV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2008/matches/6323422/results/|title=World Title's telltale hour|accessdate=2008-02-17|last=Tello|first=Craig|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|date=2008-02-17}}</ref> At WrestleMania, Undertaker defeated Edge to win the World Heavyweight Championship and extend his WrestleMania undefeated streak to 16\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|first=Craig|last=Tello|date=2008-03-30|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/2008/matches/6208634/results/|title=Sweet Sixteen|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref> On the April 4, 2008 episode of ''SmackDown'', [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General managers 2|SmackDown General Manager]] [[Vickie Guerrero]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] a WrestleMania rematch between Undertaker and Edge for the World Heavyweight Championship at Backlash.<ref name=\"4/04 SmackDown\">{{cite web|first=Brad|last=Borchardt|date=2008-04-04|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/72495/|title=411's WWE SmackDown Report 04.04.08|publisher=411mania.com|accessdate=2008-04-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080408064011/http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/72495/| archivedate= 8 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe secondary feud for [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] heading into Backlash was between [[Matt Hardy]] and [[Montel Vontavious Porter|MVP]]. On the November 16th, 2007 edition of [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] after failing to regain the [[WWE Tag Team Championship|Tag Team Championship]] from John Morrison and The Miz, MVP attacked Matt Hardy targeting and injuring his knee. The feud would start again at [[WrestleMania XXIV]] where Matt Hardy cost MVP the Money in the Bank Ladder Match by performing a Twist of Fate at the top of the ladder. Hardy would then face MVP on the April 4th, 2008 edition of SmackDown in a non-title match, which he won.

Upset over the retirement of [[Ric Flair]] at the hands of Michaels at WrestleMania XXIV, Batista interrupted Michaels' address on the April 4 episode of ''SmackDown!'' and called him a \"selfish\" person for what he did at WrestleMania. Batista blamed Michaels for not lying down for Flair and thus protecting his career instead of retiring him. Michaels defended his actions by saying Flair had called upon him to bring his best to WrestleMania, which he did. The conflict continued on an episode of [[Chris Jericho]]'s \"[[WWE Raw#Recurring segments|Highlight Reel]]\" interview segment that featured both men on the April 7 episode of ''Raw''. Following another tense verbal standoff, Batista left the ring saying he had something in store for Michaels. Moments later, Raw General Manager William Regal said he had confirmed a match with SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero between Michaels and Batista at Backlash. In addition, the following week Jericho had a confrontation with Shawn Michaels who ended up kicking Jericho in the face. Frustrated, Jericho went to Regal in an effort to possibly add himself to the match. Regal did indeed add Jericho to the match, but not as a competitor. Instead he announced Jericho as a [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|Special Guest Referee]] for the match.\n\n==Event==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel'''<ref name=\"Facts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/bkl08.html|publisher=HoffCo|title=Backlash (2008) Information|accessdate=2008-04-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080502180647/http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/bkl08.html| archivedate= 2 May 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n|-\n!Role:\n!Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=6|English [[Sportscaster|commentators]]\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mick Foley]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Jerry Lawler]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jim Ross]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Adamle]] {{small|(ECW)}}\n|-\n|[[Tazz]] {{small|(ECW)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Hugo Savinovich]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Interviewer]]s\n|[[Eve Torres]]\n|-\n|[[Todd Grisham]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|[[Lilian Garcia]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Justin Roberts]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tony Chimel]] {{small|(ECW)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=6|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[Mickie Henson]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|Mike Posey {{small|(ECW)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Chioda]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jack Doan]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jim Korderas]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (wrestling referee)|Charles Robinson]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|}\n\nBefore the event began and aired [[Live television|live]] on [[pay-per-view]], a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]] was featured in which [[WWE Tag Team Championship (2002\u20132010)|WWE Tag Team Champions]] [[John Morrison and The Miz]] defeated [[James Yun|Jimmy Wang Yang]] and [[Shannon Moore]].<ref name=\"Facts\"/>\n\n===Preliminary matches===\nFollowing the dark match, the pay-per-view event began with a standard match for the [[WWE United States Championship]], in which the champion, [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] (MVP) defended his title against [[Matt Hardy]].

The men performed a number of offensive moves on one another throughout the match, including Shawn Michaels performing a [[Professional wrestling holds#Crossface|crossface]] on Batista. The match also briefly went to the ringside area, where the ringpost was used as a weapon by Michaels. The end of the match came when Batista lifted Michaels for a [[powerbomb]], the Batista Bomb. Michaels, however, escaped from the hold in the air, and when he fell, suffered a [[kayfabe|storyline]] knee injury, which caused Jericho to check on Michaels and stop Batista from acting. Michaels eventually got to his feet, and used [[superkick|Sweet Chin Music]] on Batista. Michaels then covered Batista for a successful pinfall, winning the match.

Edge countered the move, however, into a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Sunset flip|sunset flip]].

The match began with Orton attempting to attack JBL, but JBL countered and threw Orton out of the ring.  JBL then attacked Cena, before being attacked by Triple H.  Cena then attempted to [[Professional wrestling throws#Irish whip|swing Triple H by the arm]] into the corner, but Triple H reversed the move and sent Cena outside of the ring. Triple H and JBL then fought in the ring, while Cena and Orton fought outside. Cena was later sent off the ring apron into the ''Raw'' announcer's table, and Orton and JBL teamed up to attack Triple H in the ring. Triple H eventually hit both of them with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clothesline]], and JBL went to the outside of the ring while Triple H and Orton fought inside. Triple H later went outside of the ring and fought with JBL, while Cena returned to the ring and fought with Orton.

The men fought outside the ring again, and when they returned, they fought for several more minutes until Orton performed a [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|jumping cutter]], or RKO, on Triple H. Orton would then try to pin Triple H, only to get a two count. Orton then attempted to kick Triple H in the head, but Triple H dodged the maneuver and both men would counter their finishers until Triple H performed a [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigree]] on Orton followed by a successful pin-fall, thus earning him his twelfth world championship.<ref name=\"Slam\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe feud between [[Triple H]] and [[Randy Orton]] continued.

pay-per-view events|event]] produced by [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE). It took place on April 27, 2008, at the [[1st Mariner Arena]] in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]. Following WrestleMania, all pay-per-views became tri-branded. It was the tenth annual event under the [[WWE Backlash|Backlash]] name and starred [[List of World Wrestling Entertainment employees|wrestler]] talents from [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], and [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brands]].\n\nEight [[Mock combat|professional wrestling matches]] were scheduled on the event's [[Card (sports)|card]], which featured a supercard, a scheduling of more than one [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]]. The first was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Fatal 4-Way elimination]] for the [[WWE Championship]] match featuring wrestlers from the Raw brand, in which all four men fought in the ring at the same time, with competitors being eliminated by [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]]. [[Triple H]] defeated WWE Champion [[Randy Orton]], [[John Cena]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] to win the championship. The other main event featured wrestlers from the SmackDown brand, in which defending [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[The Undertaker]] defeated challenger [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|standard wrestling match]], also known as a singles match. The main event from the ECW brand was a standard match in which defending [[ECW Championship|ECW Champion]] [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] defeated challenger [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]]. In addition, a featured bout was scheduled on the undercard, in which [[Shawn Michaels]] defeated [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] in a standard match.\n\nBacklash (2008) had an attendance of approximately 11,277 and received 200,000 buys, more than the [[Backlash (2007)|previous year's event]].<ref name=\"Revenue\">{{cite journal|title=World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

All wrestlers were from one of the WWE's brands&nbsp;\u2013 [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], or [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]]&nbsp;\u2013 the three [[WWE Brand Extension|storyline divisions]] in which WWE assigned its employees.\n\nWrestlers from Raw were featured in the [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]] at Backlash: a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|fatal 4-way elimination]] match, in which four men wrestled each other and can be eliminated only by [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]]. The match was contested for the [[WWE Championship]], featuring the champion, [[Randy Orton]], defending against [[Triple H]], [[John Cena]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] (JBL). The buildup to the match began at [[WrestleMania XXIV]], where Randy Orton defended his title against Triple H and John Cena in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]], in which the three men competed against each other, and the first man to score a pinfall or submission would win. Orton won the match, retaining the title after pinning Cena.<ref name=\"WM24-1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1206933094.shtml|title=WWE WrestleMania XXIV PPV Results \u2013 3/30/08|last=Martin|first=Adam|date=2008-03-30|publisher=WrestleView|accessdate=2009-01-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090110091532/http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1206933094.shtml| archivedate= 10 January 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"WM24-2\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/WrestleMania24/2008/03/31/5148416.html|title=Mayweather, Orton survive Mania; Edge, Flair don't|last=Plummer|first=Dave|publisher=Canoe: Slam Wrestling|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref> On the following night's episode of ''Raw'', with the WWE Championship shining on his shoulder, Randy Orton crowed about defeating both Triple H and John Cena at WrestleMania, declaring his reign as champion the \"Age of Orton\". But John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield had other ideas, telling Orton that he deserved a title match as a reward for proving that he was the toughest Superstar on Raw in his [[Hardcore wrestling|Belfast Brawl]] victory over [[Dave Finlay|Finlay]] also at WrestleMania. On the following week's episode of ''Raw'', WWE Champion Randy Orton began the night believing he would go one-on-one with JBL at Backlash, but the tide quickly turned on him. Due to Triple H's complaint about himself being [[Professional wrestling attacks#Football kick|kicked]] in the head by Orton when he was about to pin Cena to win the WWE title at Wrestlemania, [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers|General Manager]] [[Darren Matthews|William Regal]] placed Triple H into a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|Handicap match]] against Orton & JBL, and when Triple H won, Regal made the [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]] for the title. Not to be outdone, John Cena also pleaded his case to Regal, who gave him the same Handicap Match ultimatum. After Orton's intended interference failed, Cena pulled out the win, thus, the championship match at Backlash became a Fatal Four Way starring three former WWE Champions challenging Orton. On the following week's episode of ''Raw'', after his victory over William Regal, Orton felt compelled to meddle in the bout between Triple H and JBL. In an attempt at eliminating Triple H from Backlash, Orton ran in and nearly took off Triple H's head. He administered an [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|RKO]] before then teaming with JBL against him. As Orton was set to punt Triple H's noggin again, however, JBL turned on him and laid him out with a vicious [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|Clothesline From Hell]].\n\nThe main [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] heading into Backlash on the SmackDown brand was between [[The Undertaker]] and [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], over the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]].

On the November 16th, 2007 edition of [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] after failing to regain the [[WWE Tag Team Championship|Tag Team Championship]] from John Morrison and The Miz, MVP attacked Matt Hardy targeting and injuring his knee. The feud would start again at [[WrestleMania XXIV]] where Matt Hardy cost MVP the Money in the Bank Ladder Match by performing a Twist of Fate at the top of the ladder.

Upset over the retirement of [[Ric Flair]] at the hands of Michaels at WrestleMania XXIV, Batista interrupted Michaels' address on the April 4 episode of ''SmackDown!'' and called him a \"selfish\" person for what he did at WrestleMania. Batista blamed Michaels for not lying down for Flair and thus protecting his career instead of retiring him. Michaels defended his actions by saying Flair had called upon him to bring his best to WrestleMania, which he did. The conflict continued on an episode of [[Chris Jericho]]'s \"[[WWE Raw#Recurring segments|Highlight Reel]]\" interview segment that featured both men on the April 7 episode of ''Raw''. Following another tense verbal standoff, Batista left the ring saying he had something in store for Michaels. Moments later, Raw General Manager William Regal said he had confirmed a match with SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero between Michaels and Batista at Backlash. In addition, the following week Jericho had a confrontation with Shawn Michaels who ended up kicking Jericho in the face. Frustrated, Jericho went to Regal in an effort to possibly add himself to the match. Regal did indeed add Jericho to the match, but not as a competitor. Instead he announced Jericho as a [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|Special Guest Referee]] for the match.\n\n==Event==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel'''<ref name=\"Facts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/bkl08.html|publisher=HoffCo|title=Backlash (2008) Information|accessdate=2008-04-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080502180647/http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/bkl08.html| archivedate= 2 May 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n|-\n!Role:\n!Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=6|English [[Sportscaster|commentators]]\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mick Foley]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Jerry Lawler]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jim Ross]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Adamle]] {{small|(ECW)}}\n|-\n|[[Tazz]] {{small|(ECW)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Hugo Savinovich]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Interviewer]]s\n|[[Eve Torres]]\n|-\n|[[Todd Grisham]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|[[Lilian Garcia]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Justin Roberts]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tony Chimel]] {{small|(ECW)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=6|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[Mickie Henson]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|Mike Posey {{small|(ECW)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Chioda]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jack Doan]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jim Korderas]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (wrestling referee)|Charles Robinson]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|}\n\nBefore the event began and aired [[Live television|live]] on [[pay-per-view]], a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]] was featured in which [[WWE Tag Team Championship (2002\u20132010)|WWE Tag Team Champions]] [[John Morrison and The Miz]] defeated [[James Yun|Jimmy Wang Yang]] and [[Shannon Moore]].<ref name=\"Facts\"/>\n\n===Preliminary matches===\nFollowing the dark match, the pay-per-view event began with a standard match for the [[WWE United States Championship]], in which the champion, [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] (MVP) defended his title against [[Matt Hardy]].

Michaels, however, escaped from the hold in the air, and when he fell, suffered a [[kayfabe|storyline]] knee injury, which caused Jericho to check on Michaels and stop Batista from acting. Michaels eventually got to his feet, and used [[superkick|Sweet Chin Music]] on Batista. Michaels then covered Batista for a successful pinfall, winning the match. Afterward, Michaels returned to the backstage area [[Sell (professional wrestling)|while limping heavily]].<ref name=\"WrestleView\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>\n\n[[File:HBK-crossface-Batista.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shawn Michaels]] with a [[Professional wrestling holds#Crossface|Crossface]] applied to [[Dave Batista|Batista]]]]\nThe next contest was a twelve-[[WWE Diva|Diva]] [[Professional wrestling tag team match types|tag team match]] featuring the team of [[Beth Phoenix]], [[Melina Perez|Melina]], [[Natalya (wrestler)|Natayla]], [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]], [[Layla El|Layla]], and [[Jillian Hall]] against the team of [[Mickie James]], [[Ashley Massaro|Ashley]], [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]], [[Michelle McCool]], [[Kelly Kelly]], and [[Cherry (wrestler)|Cherry]]. The match began with Michelle McCool against Beth Phoenix, and over the course of the match, all of the women participated in the contest. The end of the match came when Beth Phoenix performed a [[Suplex#Fisherman suplex|fisherman suplex]] on Ashley, and then covered her for a successful pin, giving her team the victory.<ref name=\"Slam\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>\n\n===Main event matches===\n[[File:Undertaker-Gogoplata-Edge.jpg|thumb|left|Undertaker applying ''[[Gogoplata|Hell's Gate]]'' on [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], which ended the match.]]\nThe sixth match of the event was a standard match for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]], in which the champion, [[The Undertaker]], defended his title against [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. The match was contested back and forth between the two men, with the early portions of the match featuring The Undertaker controlling much of the action. Edge eventually took an advantage when he exposed the turnbuckle in the corner, and The Undertaker ran head first into it. [[Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder|Curt Hawkins]] then struck The Undertaker with the World Heavyweight Championship belt, which was followed by an unsuccessful cover by Edge.  Edge then attempted to hit Undertaker with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spear]], but The Undertaker countered the maneuver hitting Edge with a  [[DDT (professional wrestling)|DDT]]. [[Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder|Zack Ryder]] then attempted to interfere on behalf of Edge, but The Undertaker threw Edge into Ryder and then caught Edge in an attempted [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Tombstone piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]], in which The Undertaker would have held Edge upside down and knelt, driving Edge's head into the mat. Edge countered the move, however, into a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Sunset flip|sunset flip]]. While Edge was pinning The Undertaker, however, The Undertaker performed a [[gogoplata]] submission hold, which caused Edge to [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submit]], giving The Undertaker the victory. The Undertaker continued to apply the hold after the match ended, injuring (in storyline) Edge. Edge was removed from the ring on a stretcher by medics, making his injury appear realistic.<ref name=\"WrestleView\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>\n\n[[File:RandyOrtonAfterLoss.jpg|thumb|right|[[Randy Orton]] who lost the [[WWE Championship]] to [[Triple H]]]]\nThe main event was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|four-way elimination]] match for the [[WWE Championship]], in which the champion, [[Randy Orton]], defended his title against [[Triple H]], [[John Cena]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] (JBL). The match began with Orton attempting to attack JBL, but JBL countered and threw Orton out of the ring.  JBL then attacked Cena, before being attacked by Triple H.  Cena then attempted to [[Professional wrestling throws#Irish whip|swing Triple H by the arm]] into the corner, but Triple H reversed the move and sent Cena outside of the ring. Triple H and JBL then fought in the ring, while Cena and Orton fought outside. Cena was later sent off the ring apron into the ''Raw'' announcer's table, and Orton and JBL teamed up to attack Triple H in the ring. Triple H eventually hit both of them with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clothesline]], and JBL went to the outside of the ring while Triple H and Orton fought inside. Triple H later went outside of the ring and fought with JBL, while Cena returned to the ring and fought with Orton. After the men fought each other for several minutes, Cena put JBL in the [[Professional wrestling holds#Sleeper hold|STFU]]. This caused JBL to submit, eliminating him from the match. Immediately following JBL's submission, Orton [[Professional wrestling attacks#Punt|kicked Cena in the head]], which he followed with a cover for a pinfall, eliminating Cena from the match. Triple H and Orton then began to fight on the outside of the ring, with Orton taking control and sending Triple H back into the ring, where he dominated Triple H with a series of maneuvers for several minutes before Triple H struck Orton with his knee. The men fought outside the ring again, and when they returned, they fought for several more minutes until Orton performed a [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|jumping cutter]], or RKO, on Triple H. Orton would then try to pin Triple H, only to get a two count. Orton then attempted to kick Triple H in the head, but Triple H dodged the maneuver and both men would counter their finishers until Triple H performed a [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigree]] on Orton followed by a successful pin-fall, thus earning him his twelfth world championship.<ref name=\"Slam\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe feud between [[Triple H]] and [[Randy Orton]] continued. On the April 28 episode of ''Raw'', Orton challenged Triple H for the [[WWE Championship]] later on in the night.<ref name=\"WWEPreview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/matches/6990680/preview/ |title=Match Preview |accessdate=2008-05-01 |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430135350/http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/matches/6990680/preview/ |archivedate=2008-04-30 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Raw28\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/results/|title=Hear ye, hear ye|accessdate=2008-05-01|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080514184356/http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/results/| archivedate= 14 May 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Darren Matthews|William Regal]] stopped the match midway through, however, and later [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] the two in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel Cage match]] for the title at [[Judgment Day (2008)|Judgment Day]].<ref name=\"WWEPreview\"/><ref name=\"Raw28\"/>\n\nOn the May 2 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'', [[Vickie Guerrero]] cancelled a scheduled World Title match between Undertaker and [[The Great Khali]] and stripped [[The Undertaker]] of the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]], and [[Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder]] stole the physical belt and handed it to Guerrero. The next week on ''SmackDown'', Guerrero booked a \"Championship Chase\" where the winner would face the Undertaker for the vacant World Championship at Judgment Day. Batista originally won, but his victory was cut short after Guerrero came out and announced that Edge had been medically cleared and would be able to compete. Thus, the match continued, and Edge defeated Batista, gaining the championship match at Judgment Day.\n\nThe following night on ''Raw'', Mickie James' team defeated Beth Phoenix's team in a 12-Diva rematch from Backlash. The following week, James retained the Women's Championship against Phoenix in a lumberjill match, with the win coming after the evil Melina attempted to strike James with her boot, but accidentally struck Phoenix. The alliance between Phoenix and Melina ended a week later, and the two Divas would face James at Judgment Day for the title.\n\n==Reception==\nThe event had a final attendance of 11,277.
