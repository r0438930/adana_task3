Odisha has also been the home of the Kalinga, Utkal, Mahakantara/Kantara and Kosal that played a particularly prominent role in the region's history, and one of the earliest references to the ancient Kalingas appears in the writings of Vedic chroniclers.[Refernce-Odisha Familypedia].\nOdia is an [[List of Eastern Indo-Aryan languages|Eastern Indo-Aryan language]] belonging to the Indo-Aryan language family.

A new form of metrical epic-poems (called ''Chhanda-Kabya'') evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote ''Haravali.'' [[Upendra Bhanja]] took a leading role in this period- his creations ''Baidehisha Bilasa'', ''Koti Brahmanda Sundari'', ''Labanyabati'' were landmarks in Odia Literature. Dinakrushna Dasa's ''Rasokallola'' and Abhimanyu Samanta Singhara's ''Bidagdha Chintamani'' are prominent Kavyas of this time. Four major poets emerged in the end of the era are Baladeba Rath, Bhima Bhoi, [[Brajanath Badajena]] and Gopala Krushna Pattanaik.\n* Modern Odia (1850 till present day): The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by the Christian missionaries which made a great revolution in Odia literature and language.\n\n===Charyapada of 8th Century and its affinity with Odia language===\nThe beginning of Odia poetry coincide with the development of ''charya sahitya'', the literature started by [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist poets such as in the [[Charyapada]]. This literature was written in a specific metaphor called [[twilight language]] and prominent poets included [[Luipa]], [[Tilopa]] and [[Kanha (poet)|Kanha]]. Quite importantly, the [[raga]]s that are mentioned for singing the Charyapadas are found abundantly in later Odia literature.\n\n===Poet Jayadeva's literary contribution===\n[[Jayadeva]] was a Sanskrit poet. He was born in an [[Utkala Brahmin]] family of Puri in circa 1200&nbsp;AD. He is most known for his composition, the epic poem [[Gita Govinda]], which depicts the divine love of the Hindu deity Krishna and his consort, Radha, and is considered an important text in the Bhakti movement of Hinduism.

There are three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) and two grammatical numbers (singular and plural). There are three true tenses (present, past and future), others being formed with auxiliaries.\n\n==Writing system==\n{{main|Odia alphabet|Odia braille}}\n\n==Literature==\n{{main|Odia literature}}\n\nThe earliest literature in Odia language can be traced to the Charyapadas composed in the 7th to 9th centuries.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Medieval Indian Literature: Surveys and selections|url = {{Google books|id=KYLpvaKJIMEC|plainurl=yes}}|publisher = Sahitya Akademi|date = 1997-01-01|isbn = 9788126003655}}</ref> Before Sarala Das, the most important works in Odia literature are the Shishu Veda, Saptanga, Amara Kosha, Rudrasudhanidhi, Kesaba Koili, Kalasha Chautisha etc.<ref name=\"patnaik 1989\" /><ref name=\"panda\" /><ref name=\"patnaik 1997\" /> In the 14th century, the poet [[Sarala Das]] wrote the Sarala Mahabharata, Chandi Purana, and Vilanka Ramayana, in praise of the goddess [[Durga]]. Rama-Bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in the Odia language.\n\nThe following era is termed the [[Odia Literature|Panchasakha Age]] and stretches until the year 1700. The period begins with the writings of [[Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] whose Vaishnava influence brought in a new evolution in Odia literature.  Notable religious works of the Panchasakha Age include those of [[Balarama Dasa]], [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], Yasovanta, Ananta and [[Acyutananda]]. The authors of this period mainly translated, adapted, or imitated Sanskrit literature. Other prominent works of the period include the [[Usabhilasa]] of [[Sisu Sankara Dasa]], the [[Rahasya-manjari]] of [[Deva-durlabha Dasa]] and the Rukmini-bibha of [[Kartikka Dasa]]. A new form of novels in verse evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when [[Ramachandra Pattanayaka]] wrote Haravali. Other poets like Madhusudana, [[Bhima Bhoi]], [[Dhivara]], [[Sadasiva]] and [[Sisu Isvara-dasa]] composed another form called [[kavyas]] (long poems) based on themes from Puranas, with an emphasis on plain, simple language.\n\nHowever, during the [[Odia literature#Age of Upendra Bhanja|Bhanja Age]] (also known as the Age of Riti Yuga) beginning with turn of the 18th century, verbally tricky Odia became the order of the day. Verbal jugglery, obscenity and eroticism characterise the period between 1700 and 1850, particularly in the works of the era's eponymous poet [[Upendra Bhanja]] (1670\u20131720). Bhanja's work inspired many imitators of which the most notable is Arakshita Das. Family chronicles in prose relating religious festivals and rituals are also characteristic of the period.\n\nThe first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by Christian missionaries. Although the handwritten Odia script of the time closely resembled the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali]] and [[Assamese alphabet|Assamese scripts]], the one adopted for the printed typesets was significantly different, leaning more towards the [[Tamil script]] and [[Telugu script]]. [[Amos Sutton]] produced an Oriya Bible (1840), Oriya Dictionary (1841\u201343) and<ref>Biswamoy Pati Situating social history: Orissa, 1800\u20131997 p30</ref> ''An Introductory Grammar of Oriya'' (1844).<ref>The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti):   2 p1030 ed. Amaresh Datta \u2013 2006 \"Amos Sutton also prepared a dictionary named Sadhu bhasharthabhidhan, a vocabulary of current Sanskrit terms with Odia definitions which was also printed in Odisha Mission Press in 1844.\"</ref>\n\nOdia has a rich literary heritage dating back to the thirteenth century. [[Sarala Dasa]] who lived in the fourteenth century is known as the [[Vyasa]] of Odisha. He translated the [[Mahabharata]] into Odia. In fact, the language was initially standardised through a process of translating classical Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata, [[Ramayana]] and Srimad Bhagabata Gita. The translation of the Srimad Bhagabata Gita by Jagannatha Dasa was particularly influential on the written form of the language. Odia has had a strong tradition of poetry, especially [[worship|devotional]] poetry.\n\nOther eminent Odia poets include [[Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja]] and [[Kavisurya Baladev Rath|Kabisurya Baladev Ratha]].\n\nProse in the language has had a late development.\n\nThree great poets and prose writers, [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]] (1849\u20131908), [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]] (1843\u20131918) and [[Madhusudan Rao]] (1853\u20131912)  made Odia their own. They brought in a modern outlook and spirit into Odia literature. Around the same time the modern drama took birth in the works of Rama Sankara Ray beginning with Kanci-Kaveri (1880).\n\nAmong the contemporaries of Fakir Mohan, four novelists deserve special mention: Aparna Panda, Mrutyunjay Rath, Ram Chandra Acharya and Brajabandhu Mishra. Aparna Panda's Kalavati and Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati were both published in 1902, the year in which Chha Mana Atha Guntha came out in the book form. Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati, which came out from Bamanda, depicts the conflict between a poor but highly educated young man and a wealthy and highly egoistic young woman whose conjugal life is seriously affected by ego clashes. Through a story of union, separation and reunion, the novelist delineates the psychological state of a young woman in separation from her husband and examines the significance of marriage as a social institution in traditional Indian society. Ram Chandra Acharya wrote about seven novels during 1924\u20131936. All his novels are historical romances based on the historical events in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Odisha. Mrutyunjay Rath's novel, Adbhuta Parinama, published in 1915, centres round a young Hindu who gets converted to Christianity to marry a Christian girl.\n\nOne of the great writers in the 19th century was Pandit [[Krushna Chandra Kar]] (1907\u20131995) from Cuttack, who wrote many books for children like ''Pari Raija, Kuhuka Raija, Panchatantra, Adi Jugara Galpa Mala'', etc. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1971\u201372 for his contributions to Odia literature, development of children's fiction, and biographies.\n\nOne of the prominent writers of the 19th and 20th centuries was Muralidhar Mallick (1927\u20132002). His contribution to Historical novels is beyond words. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1998 for his contributions to Odia literature. His son Khagendranath Mallick (born 1951) is also a writer. His contribution towards poetry, criticism, essays, story and novels is commendable. He was the former President of Utkal Kala Parishad and also former President of Odisha Geeti Kabi Samaj. Presently he is a member of the Executive Committee of Utkal Sahitya Samaj. Another illustrious writer of the 20th century was Mr. Chintamani Das. A noted academician, he was written more than 40 books including fiction, short stories, biographies and storybooks for children. Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village under Satyabadi block, Chintamani Das is the only writer who has written biographies on all the five 'Pancha Sakhas' of Satyabadi namely Pandit Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihara, Nilakantha Das, Krupasindhu Mishra and Pandit Godabarisha. Having served as the Head of the Odia department of Khallikote College, Berhampur, Chintamani Das was felicitated with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his outstanding contribution to Odia literature in general and Satyabadi Yuga literature in particular. Some of his well-known literary creations are 'Bhala Manisha Hua', 'Manishi Nilakantha', 'Kabi Godabarisha', 'Byasakabi Fakiramohan', 'Usha', 'Barabati'.\n\n20th century writers in Odia include Pallikabi [[Nanda Kishore Bal]] (1875\u20131928), [[Gangadhar Meher]] (1862\u20131924), [[Chintamani Mahanti]] and [[Kuntala Kumari Sabat]], besides [[Niladri Dasa]] and [[Gopabandhu Das]] (1877\u20131928). The most notable novelists were [[Umesa Sarakara]], [[Divyasimha Panigrahi]], [[Gopala Praharaja]] and [[Kalindi Charan Panigrahi]]. [[Sachi Kanta Rauta Ray]] is the great introducer of the ultra-modern style in modern Odia poetry. Others who took up this form were [[Godabarisha Mohapatra]], [[Mayadhara Manasimha]], [[Nityananda Mahapatra]] and [[Kunjabihari Dasa]]. [[Prabhasa Chandra Satpathi]] is known for his translations of some western classics apart from [[Udayanatha Shadangi]], [[Sunanda Kara]] and [[Surendranatha Dwivedi]]. Criticism, essays and history also became major lines of writing in the Odia language. Esteemed writers in this field were Professor [[Girija Shankar Ray]], [[Pandit Vinayaka Misra]], Professor [[Gauri Kumara Brahma]], [[Jagabandhu Simha]] and [[Harekrushna Mahatab]]. Odia literature mirrors the industrious, peaceful and artistic image of the [[Odia people]] who have offered and gifted much to the Indian civilization in the field of art and literature. Now Writers [[Manoj Das]]'s creations motivated and inspired people towards a positive lifestyle .Distinguished prose writers of the modern period include [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]], [[Madhusudan Das]], Godabarisha Mohapatra, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, [[Surendra Mohanty]], [[Manoj Das]],  Kishori Charan Das, Gopinath Mohanty, Rabi Patnaik, Chandrasekhar Rath, Binapani Mohanty, Bhikari Rath, [[Jagadish Mohanty]], [[Sarojini Sahoo]], [[Yashodhara Mishra]], Ramchandra Behera, Padmaja Pal. But it is poetry that makes modern Odia literature a force to reckon with. Poets like [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]], Sachidananda Routray, Guruprasad Mohanty, Soubhagya Misra, [[Ramakanta Rath]], Sitakanta Mohapatra, Rajendra Kishore Panda, Pratibha Satpathy have made significant contributions towards Indian poetry.\n\n[[Anita Desai]]'s novella, ''Translator Translated'', from her collection ''The Art of Disappearance'', features a translator of a fictive Odia short story writer; the novella contains a discussion of the perils of translating works composed in regional Indian languages into English.\n\nFour writers in Odia \u2013 [[Gopinath Mohanty]], [[Sachidananda Routray]], [[Sitakant Mahapatra]] and [[Pratibha Ray]] \u2013 have been awarded the [[Jnanpith Award|Jnanpith]], a prestigious Indian literary award.\n\n== Language sample ==\nThe first article of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in Odia:\n\u0b05\u0b28\u0b41\u0b1a\u0b4d\u0b1b\u0b47\u0b26 \u0b0f\u0b15:\u0b38\u0b2c\u0b41 \u0b2e\u0b28\u0b41\u0b37\u0b4d\u0b5f \u0b1c\u0b28\u0b4d\u0b2e\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b33\u0b30\u0b41 \u0b38\u0b4d\u0b71\u0b3e\u0b27\u0b40\u0b28\u0964 \u0b38\u0b47\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b28\u0b19\u0b4d\u0b15\u0b30 \u0b2e\u0b30\u0b4d\u0b2f\u0b4d\u0b5f\u0b3e\u0b26\u0b3e \u0b13 \u0b05\u0b27\u0b3f\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b30 \u0b38\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b28\u0964 \u0b38\u0b47\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b28\u0b19\u0b4d\u0b15\u0b20\u0b3e\u0b30\u0b47 \u0b2a\u0b4d\u0b30\u0b1c\u0b4d\u0b1e\u0b3e \u0b13 \u0b2c\u0b3f\u0b2c\u0b47\u0b15 \u0b28\u0b3f\u0b39\u0b3f\u0b24 \u0b05\u0b1b\u0b3f\u0964 \u0b38\u0b47\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b28\u0b47 \u0b2a\u0b30\u0b38\u0b4d\u0b2a\u0b30 \u0b2a\u0b4d\u0b30\u0b24\u0b3f \u0b2d\u0b4d\u0b30\u0b3e\u0b24\u0b43\u0b2d\u0b3e\u0b2c \u0b2a\u0b4b\u0b37\u0b23 \u0b15\u0b3e\u0b30\u0b4d\u0b2f\u0b4d\u0b5f \u0b15\u0b30\u0b3f\u0b2c\u0b3e \u0b26\u0b30\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b30\u0964\n:[[File:Universal Declaration of Human Rights - ori - ra - Art1.ogg]]\n:''All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

A new form of metrical epic-poems (called ''Chhanda-Kabya'') evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote ''Haravali.'' [[Upendra Bhanja]] took a leading role in this period- his creations ''Baidehisha Bilasa'', ''Koti Brahmanda Sundari'', ''Labanyabati'' were landmarks in Odia Literature. Dinakrushna Dasa's ''Rasokallola'' and Abhimanyu Samanta Singhara's ''Bidagdha Chintamani'' are prominent Kavyas of this time. Four major poets emerged in the end of the era are Baladeba Rath, Bhima Bhoi, [[Brajanath Badajena]] and Gopala Krushna Pattanaik.\n* Modern Odia (1850 till present day): The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by the Christian missionaries which made a great revolution in Odia literature and language.\n\n===Charyapada of 8th Century and its affinity with Odia language===\nThe beginning of Odia poetry coincide with the development of ''charya sahitya'', the literature started by [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist poets such as in the [[Charyapada]]. This literature was written in a specific metaphor called [[twilight language]] and prominent poets included [[Luipa]], [[Tilopa]] and [[Kanha (poet)|Kanha]]. Quite importantly, the [[raga]]s that are mentioned for singing the Charyapadas are found abundantly in later Odia literature.\n\n===Poet Jayadeva's literary contribution===\n[[Jayadeva]] was a Sanskrit poet. He was born in an [[Utkala Brahmin]] family of Puri in circa 1200&nbsp;AD. He is most known for his composition, the epic poem [[Gita Govinda]], which depicts the divine love of the Hindu deity Krishna and his consort, Radha, and is considered an important text in the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. About the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, the influence of [[Works of Jayadeva|Jayadeva's literary contribution]] changed the pattern of versification in Odia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n==Phonology==\n[[File:Odia phonology.webm|thumb|Pronunciation of [[Odia alphabet]].]]\nOdia has 29 consonant phonemes, 2 semivowel phonemes and 6 vowel phonemes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Odia vowel phonemes<ref name=\":0\">{{harvcoltxt|Ray|2003|p=526}}</ref>\n! ||[[Front vowel|Front]]||[[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n![[High vowel|High]]\n|{{IPA|i}}||{{IPA|u}}\n|-\n![[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n|{{IPA|e}}||{{IPA|o}}\n|-\n![[Low vowel|Low]]\n|{{IPA|a}}|||{{IPA|\u0254}}\n|}\n\nLong vowels are not necessary because they all become short.

Rama-Bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in the Odia language.\n\nThe following era is termed the [[Odia Literature|Panchasakha Age]] and stretches until the year 1700. The period begins with the writings of [[Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] whose Vaishnava influence brought in a new evolution in Odia literature.  Notable religious works of the Panchasakha Age include those of [[Balarama Dasa]], [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], Yasovanta, Ananta and [[Acyutananda]]. The authors of this period mainly translated, adapted, or imitated Sanskrit literature. Other prominent works of the period include the [[Usabhilasa]] of [[Sisu Sankara Dasa]], the [[Rahasya-manjari]] of [[Deva-durlabha Dasa]] and the Rukmini-bibha of [[Kartikka Dasa]]. A new form of novels in verse evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when [[Ramachandra Pattanayaka]] wrote Haravali. Other poets like Madhusudana, [[Bhima Bhoi]], [[Dhivara]], [[Sadasiva]] and [[Sisu Isvara-dasa]] composed another form called [[kavyas]] (long poems) based on themes from Puranas, with an emphasis on plain, simple language.\n\nHowever, during the [[Odia literature#Age of Upendra Bhanja|Bhanja Age]] (also known as the Age of Riti Yuga) beginning with turn of the 18th century, verbally tricky Odia became the order of the day. Verbal jugglery, obscenity and eroticism characterise the period between 1700 and 1850, particularly in the works of the era's eponymous poet [[Upendra Bhanja]] (1670\u20131720). Bhanja's work inspired many imitators of which the most notable is Arakshita Das. Family chronicles in prose relating religious festivals and rituals are also characteristic of the period.\n\nThe first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by Christian missionaries. Although the handwritten Odia script of the time closely resembled the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali]] and [[Assamese alphabet|Assamese scripts]], the one adopted for the printed typesets was significantly different, leaning more towards the [[Tamil script]] and [[Telugu script]]. [[Amos Sutton]] produced an Oriya Bible (1840), Oriya Dictionary (1841\u201343) and<ref>Biswamoy Pati Situating social history: Orissa, 1800\u20131997 p30</ref> ''An Introductory Grammar of Oriya'' (1844).<ref>The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti):   2 p1030 ed. Amaresh Datta \u2013 2006 \"Amos Sutton also prepared a dictionary named Sadhu bhasharthabhidhan, a vocabulary of current Sanskrit terms with Odia definitions which was also printed in Odisha Mission Press in 1844.\"</ref>\n\nOdia has a rich literary heritage dating back to the thirteenth century. [[Sarala Dasa]] who lived in the fourteenth century is known as the [[Vyasa]] of Odisha. He translated the [[Mahabharata]] into Odia. In fact, the language was initially standardised through a process of translating classical Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata, [[Ramayana]] and Srimad Bhagabata Gita. The translation of the Srimad Bhagabata Gita by Jagannatha Dasa was particularly influential on the written form of the language. Odia has had a strong tradition of poetry, especially [[worship|devotional]] poetry.\n\nOther eminent Odia poets include [[Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja]] and [[Kavisurya Baladev Rath|Kabisurya Baladev Ratha]].\n\nProse in the language has had a late development.\n\nThree great poets and prose writers, [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]] (1849\u20131908), [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]] (1843\u20131918) and [[Madhusudan Rao]] (1853\u20131912)  made Odia their own. They brought in a modern outlook and spirit into Odia literature. Around the same time the modern drama took birth in the works of Rama Sankara Ray beginning with Kanci-Kaveri (1880).\n\nAmong the contemporaries of Fakir Mohan, four novelists deserve special mention: Aparna Panda, Mrutyunjay Rath, Ram Chandra Acharya and Brajabandhu Mishra. Aparna Panda's Kalavati and Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati were both published in 1902, the year in which Chha Mana Atha Guntha came out in the book form. Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati, which came out from Bamanda, depicts the conflict between a poor but highly educated young man and a wealthy and highly egoistic young woman whose conjugal life is seriously affected by ego clashes. Through a story of union, separation and reunion, the novelist delineates the psychological state of a young woman in separation from her husband and examines the significance of marriage as a social institution in traditional Indian society. Ram Chandra Acharya wrote about seven novels during 1924\u20131936. All his novels are historical romances based on the historical events in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Odisha. Mrutyunjay Rath's novel, Adbhuta Parinama, published in 1915, centres round a young Hindu who gets converted to Christianity to marry a Christian girl.\n\nOne of the great writers in the 19th century was Pandit [[Krushna Chandra Kar]] (1907\u20131995) from Cuttack, who wrote many books for children like ''Pari Raija, Kuhuka Raija, Panchatantra, Adi Jugara Galpa Mala'', etc. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1971\u201372 for his contributions to Odia literature, development of children's fiction, and biographies.\n\nOne of the prominent writers of the 19th and 20th centuries was Muralidhar Mallick (1927\u20132002). His contribution to Historical novels is beyond words. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1998 for his contributions to Odia literature. His son Khagendranath Mallick (born 1951) is also a writer. His contribution towards poetry, criticism, essays, story and novels is commendable. He was the former President of Utkal Kala Parishad and also former President of Odisha Geeti Kabi Samaj. Presently he is a member of the Executive Committee of Utkal Sahitya Samaj. Another illustrious writer of the 20th century was Mr. Chintamani Das. A noted academician, he was written more than 40 books including fiction, short stories, biographies and storybooks for children. Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village under Satyabadi block, Chintamani Das is the only writer who has written biographies on all the five 'Pancha Sakhas' of Satyabadi namely Pandit Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihara, Nilakantha Das, Krupasindhu Mishra and Pandit Godabarisha. Having served as the Head of the Odia department of Khallikote College, Berhampur, Chintamani Das was felicitated with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his outstanding contribution to Odia literature in general and Satyabadi Yuga literature in particular. Some of his well-known literary creations are 'Bhala Manisha Hua', 'Manishi Nilakantha', 'Kabi Godabarisha', 'Byasakabi Fakiramohan', 'Usha', 'Barabati'.\n\n20th century writers in Odia include Pallikabi [[Nanda Kishore Bal]] (1875\u20131928), [[Gangadhar Meher]] (1862\u20131924), [[Chintamani Mahanti]] and [[Kuntala Kumari Sabat]], besides [[Niladri Dasa]] and [[Gopabandhu Das]] (1877\u20131928). The most notable novelists were [[Umesa Sarakara]], [[Divyasimha Panigrahi]], [[Gopala Praharaja]] and [[Kalindi Charan Panigrahi]]. [[Sachi Kanta Rauta Ray]] is the great introducer of the ultra-modern style in modern Odia poetry. Others who took up this form were [[Godabarisha Mohapatra]], [[Mayadhara Manasimha]], [[Nityananda Mahapatra]] and [[Kunjabihari Dasa]]. [[Prabhasa Chandra Satpathi]] is known for his translations of some western classics apart from [[Udayanatha Shadangi]], [[Sunanda Kara]] and [[Surendranatha Dwivedi]]. Criticism, essays and history also became major lines of writing in the Odia language. Esteemed writers in this field were Professor [[Girija Shankar Ray]], [[Pandit Vinayaka Misra]], Professor [[Gauri Kumara Brahma]], [[Jagabandhu Simha]] and [[Harekrushna Mahatab]]. Odia literature mirrors the industrious, peaceful and artistic image of the [[Odia people]] who have offered and gifted much to the Indian civilization in the field of art and literature. Now Writers [[Manoj Das]]'s creations motivated and inspired people towards a positive lifestyle .Distinguished prose writers of the modern period include [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]], [[Madhusudan Das]], Godabarisha Mohapatra, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, [[Surendra Mohanty]], [[Manoj Das]],  Kishori Charan Das, Gopinath Mohanty, Rabi Patnaik, Chandrasekhar Rath, Binapani Mohanty, Bhikari Rath, [[Jagadish Mohanty]], [[Sarojini Sahoo]], [[Yashodhara Mishra]], Ramchandra Behera, Padmaja Pal. But it is poetry that makes modern Odia literature a force to reckon with. Poets like [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]], Sachidananda Routray, Guruprasad Mohanty, Soubhagya Misra, [[Ramakanta Rath]], Sitakanta Mohapatra, Rajendra Kishore Panda, Pratibha Satpathy have made significant contributions towards Indian poetry.\n\n[[Anita Desai]]'s novella, ''Translator Translated'', from her collection ''The Art of Disappearance'', features a translator of a fictive Odia short story writer; the novella contains a discussion of the perils of translating works composed in regional Indian languages into English.\n\nFour writers in Odia \u2013 [[Gopinath Mohanty]], [[Sachidananda Routray]], [[Sitakant Mahapatra]] and [[Pratibha Ray]] \u2013 have been awarded the [[Jnanpith Award|Jnanpith]], a prestigious Indian literary award.\n\n== Language sample ==\nThe first article of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in Odia:\n\u0b05\u0b28\u0b41\u0b1a\u0b4d\u0b1b\u0b47\u0b26 \u0b0f\u0b15:\u0b38\u0b2c\u0b41 \u0b2e\u0b28\u0b41\u0b37\u0b4d\u0b5f \u0b1c\u0b28\u0b4d\u0b2e\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b33\u0b30\u0b41 \u0b38\u0b4d\u0b71\u0b3e\u0b27\u0b40\u0b28\u0964 \u0b38\u0b47\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b28\u0b19\u0b4d\u0b15\u0b30 \u0b2e\u0b30\u0b4d\u0b2f\u0b4d\u0b5f\u0b3e\u0b26\u0b3e \u0b13 \u0b05\u0b27\u0b3f\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b30 \u0b38\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b28\u0964 \u0b38\u0b47\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b28\u0b19\u0b4d\u0b15\u0b20\u0b3e\u0b30\u0b47 \u0b2a\u0b4d\u0b30\u0b1c\u0b4d\u0b1e\u0b3e \u0b13 \u0b2c\u0b3f\u0b2c\u0b47\u0b15 \u0b28\u0b3f\u0b39\u0b3f\u0b24 \u0b05\u0b1b\u0b3f\u0964 \u0b38\u0b47\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b28\u0b47 \u0b2a\u0b30\u0b38\u0b4d\u0b2a\u0b30 \u0b2a\u0b4d\u0b30\u0b24\u0b3f \u0b2d\u0b4d\u0b30\u0b3e\u0b24\u0b43\u0b2d\u0b3e\u0b2c \u0b2a\u0b4b\u0b37\u0b23 \u0b15\u0b3e\u0b30\u0b4d\u0b2f\u0b4d\u0b5f \u0b15\u0b30\u0b3f\u0b2c\u0b3e \u0b26\u0b30\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b30\u0964\n:[[File:Universal Declaration of Human Rights - ori - ra - Art1.ogg]]\n:''All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
