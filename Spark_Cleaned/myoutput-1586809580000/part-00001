Davies''' (born [[Birkenhead]], 14 July 1927, died [[Caldy]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]], 19 March 2020) was a British economic historian with interests in the port of [[Liverpool]], sea-based trade with [[West Africa]], the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Japan]], the international fruit trade and the military history of the [[Khwae Yai River|River Kwai]] campaign in [[World War II]]. He was an Emeritus Professor in the School of History at the [[University of Liverpool]], [[England]].\n\nDavies was the author of several books including, \"The Trade Makers, [[Elder Dempster]] in West Africa\" (Allen and Unwin, 1973), \"Trading in West Africa\" (Croom Helm, 1976), \"Sir Alfred Jones: Shipping Entrepreneur par Excellence\" (Europa, 1978), \"[[Fyffes]] and the Banana, Musa Sapientum\" (Athlone Press, 1990), \"Japanese Shipping and Shipbuilding Industries: A History of Their Modern Growth\" (with T.

Davies continued the tradition of commitment to Maritime History which had been initiated by Francis Hyde and maintained by John Harris (subsequently Professor of Economic History at the [[University of Birmingham]]) and Sheila Marriner.
