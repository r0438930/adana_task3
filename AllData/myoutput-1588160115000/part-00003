The plot follows a group of high school seniors who are targeted at their [[prom]] by a masked killer seeking vengeance for the accidental death of a young girl six years earlier. It features supporting performances from Casey Stevens, [[Anne-Marie Martin|Eddie Benton]], [[Mary Beth Rubens]] and Michael Tough.\n\n''Prom Night'' was filmed in [[Toronto]] in late 1979 on a budget of $1.5 million. Distributed by [[Embassy Pictures|AVCO Embassy Pictures]], it premiered in the United States in July 1980 in select cities, and was an immediate financial success. Its release platform expanded to major cities such as [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City|New York]] in August, where it was again met with high box-office receipts. At the time, the film was AVCO Embassy's most financially successful release, breaking weekend records in Los Angeles, [[Philadelphia]], and [[New England]].\n\nBy the end of its theatrical run, ''Prom Night'' had grossed $15 million in the United States, and was Canada's highest-earning horror film of 1980. Critical reaction to the film varied, with some, such as [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]], dismissing it for its depictions of [[violence against women]], while others alternately praised the film for its more muted violent content. ''Prom Night'' received some critical accolades, garnering [[Genie Awards|Genie Award]] nominations for editing and for Curtis's leading performance. An alternative cut of the film was popularly aired on American and Canadian television networks in 1981.\n\nIn the intervening years, ''Prom Night'' has accrued a substantial [[cult following]],{{sfn|Wise|2001|p=174}} not only for its horror content but also for its [[disco]]-heavy soundtrack, which was released by [[RCA Records]] in Japan in 1980. Some film scholars have cited ''Prom Night'' as one of the most influential slasher films of the period.{{sfn|Nowell|2010|p=10}} Several companies released the film on video, and it was distributed on [[DVD]] by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] in 1998. A remastered [[Blu-ray]] edition was released by [[Synapse Films]] in 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1974, 11-year-olds Wendy Richards, Jude Cunningham, Kelly Lynch and Nick McBride play hide-and-seek in an abandoned convent. When 10-year-old Robin Hammond tries to join them, the group starts teasing her, repeating \"Kill! Kill! Kill!\", and leading to a scared Robin accidentally falling to her death through a second story window. The children make a pact not to tell anyone what happened and keep the incident a secret and they leave. Just then, a shadow crosses over Robin's body, who witnessed Robin's death.\n\nSix years later in 1980, Robin's family attend her memorial on the anniversary of her death. Robin's teenage sister, Kim, and [[Twin#Dizygotic (fraternal) twins|fraternal twin]] brother, Alex, are preparing for the school prom to be held that evening. Kelly, Jude and Wendy begin receiving anonymous obscene phone calls, while Nick ignores his ringing phone.\n\nKim and Nick are now dating and plan on attending prom together. Jude is asked by goofy jokester Seymour \"Slick\" Crane, who she meets by chance. Kelly is going with Drew, her boyfriend. Wendy\u2014Nick's ex-girlfriend\u2014asks Lou to the prom with the sole purpose of embarrassing Nick and her rival Kim. In the changing room after gym class, Kim and Kelly discover the locker room mirror cracked with a shard missing. Later, Wendy, Jude and Kelly each find their yearbook photos stabbed with a piece of glass. Meanwhile, Kim and Alex's father (also the school principal) learns that the [[sex offender]] blamed for Robin's death has escaped from a psychiatric facility. Lt. McBride, Nick's father, investigates his disappearance.\n\nDuring the senior prom, Kelly and Drew make out in the changing room, but Kelly, a virgin, refuses to have sex and Drew angrily leaves. As Kelly gets dressed, an unidentified figure wearing a [[balaclava (clothing)|ski mask]] and all-black clothing approaches her and slits her throat with a mirror shard. Jude and Slick have sex and smoke marijuana in his van parked outside school grounds. They are attacked by the masked killer, who stabs Jude in the throat. Slick struggles with the killer, who jumps from the vehicle before Slick drives off a cliff to his death. Staking out the prom, McBride is informed that the sex offender blamed for Robin's death has been caught.\n\nNow wielding an ax, the killer confronts and chases Wendy through the school. Evading the killer several times, she screams when she discovers Kelly's body in a storage room and is hacked to death. The [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] school janitor, Sykes, witnesses Wendy's murder and attempts to notify the school staff, but they dismiss it as a drunken rant. Meanwhile, Kim and Nick prepare to be crowned prom king and queen, but Lou and his lackeys tie up Nick, and Lou takes his crown. Mistaking him for Nick, the killer approaches Lou from behind and decapitates him. Lou's severed head rolls onto the dance floor, sending the prom-goers fleeing in horror.\n\nKim finds Nick and frees him. As they prepare to escape, they are confronted by the killer who attacks Nick but not Kim. In the ensuing brawl, Kim strikes the killer's head with the ax. She and the killer stare at each other and Kim realizes his identity. The killer runs outside where the police have arrived. The killer collapses and is then revealed to be Alex, who explains to his sister that he witnessed their sister's death, and that Jude, Kelly, Wendy and Nick were responsible. He cries out Robin's name before dying in Kim's arms. Kim cries over the death of another sibling.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as Mr. Hammond\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Kimberly \"Kim\" Hammond\n* Casey Stevens as Nick McBride\n* [[Anne-Marie Martin|Eddie Benton]] as Wendy Richards\n* Michael Tough as Alex Hammond\n* [[Robert A.

The plot follows a group of high school seniors who are targeted at their [[prom]] by a masked killer seeking vengeance for the accidental death of a young girl six years earlier. It features supporting performances from Casey Stevens, [[Anne-Marie Martin|Eddie Benton]], [[Mary Beth Rubens]] and Michael Tough.\n\n''Prom Night'' was filmed in [[Toronto]] in late 1979 on a budget of $1.5 million. Distributed by [[Embassy Pictures|AVCO Embassy Pictures]], it premiered in the United States in July 1980 in select cities, and was an immediate financial success. Its release platform expanded to major cities such as [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City|New York]] in August, where it was again met with high box-office receipts. At the time, the film was AVCO Embassy's most financially successful release, breaking weekend records in Los Angeles, [[Philadelphia]], and [[New England]].\n\nBy the end of its theatrical run, ''Prom Night'' had grossed $15 million in the United States, and was Canada's highest-earning horror film of 1980. Critical reaction to the film varied, with some, such as [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]], dismissing it for its depictions of [[violence against women]], while others alternately praised the film for its more muted violent content. ''Prom Night'' received some critical accolades, garnering [[Genie Awards|Genie Award]] nominations for editing and for Curtis's leading performance. An alternative cut of the film was popularly aired on American and Canadian television networks in 1981.\n\nIn the intervening years, ''Prom Night'' has accrued a substantial [[cult following]],{{sfn|Wise|2001|p=174}} not only for its horror content but also for its [[disco]]-heavy soundtrack, which was released by [[RCA Records]] in Japan in 1980. Some film scholars have cited ''Prom Night'' as one of the most influential slasher films of the period.{{sfn|Nowell|2010|p=10}} Several companies released the film on video, and it was distributed on [[DVD]] by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] in 1998. A remastered [[Blu-ray]] edition was released by [[Synapse Films]] in 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1974, 11-year-olds Wendy Richards, Jude Cunningham, Kelly Lynch and Nick McBride play hide-and-seek in an abandoned convent. When 10-year-old Robin Hammond tries to join them, the group starts teasing her, repeating \"Kill! Kill! Kill!\", and leading to a scared Robin accidentally falling to her death through a second story window. The children make a pact not to tell anyone what happened and keep the incident a secret and they leave. Just then, a shadow crosses over Robin's body, who witnessed Robin's death.\n\nSix years later in 1980, Robin's family attend her memorial on the anniversary of her death. Robin's teenage sister, Kim, and [[Twin#Dizygotic (fraternal) twins|fraternal twin]] brother, Alex, are preparing for the school prom to be held that evening. Kelly, Jude and Wendy begin receiving anonymous obscene phone calls, while Nick ignores his ringing phone.\n\nKim and Nick are now dating and plan on attending prom together. Jude is asked by goofy jokester Seymour \"Slick\" Crane, who she meets by chance. Kelly is going with Drew, her boyfriend. Wendy\u2014Nick's ex-girlfriend\u2014asks Lou to the prom with the sole purpose of embarrassing Nick and her rival Kim. In the changing room after gym class, Kim and Kelly discover the locker room mirror cracked with a shard missing. Later, Wendy, Jude and Kelly each find their yearbook photos stabbed with a piece of glass. Meanwhile, Kim and Alex's father (also the school principal) learns that the [[sex offender]] blamed for Robin's death has escaped from a psychiatric facility. Lt. McBride, Nick's father, investigates his disappearance.\n\nDuring the senior prom, Kelly and Drew make out in the changing room, but Kelly, a virgin, refuses to have sex and Drew angrily leaves. As Kelly gets dressed, an unidentified figure wearing a [[balaclava (clothing)|ski mask]] and all-black clothing approaches her and slits her throat with a mirror shard. Jude and Slick have sex and smoke marijuana in his van parked outside school grounds. They are attacked by the masked killer, who stabs Jude in the throat. Slick struggles with the killer, who jumps from the vehicle before Slick drives off a cliff to his death. Staking out the prom, McBride is informed that the sex offender blamed for Robin's death has been caught.\n\nNow wielding an ax, the killer confronts and chases Wendy through the school. Evading the killer several times, she screams when she discovers Kelly's body in a storage room and is hacked to death. The [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] school janitor, Sykes, witnesses Wendy's murder and attempts to notify the school staff, but they dismiss it as a drunken rant. Meanwhile, Kim and Nick prepare to be crowned prom king and queen, but Lou and his lackeys tie up Nick, and Lou takes his crown. Mistaking him for Nick, the killer approaches Lou from behind and decapitates him. Lou's severed head rolls onto the dance floor, sending the prom-goers fleeing in horror.\n\nKim finds Nick and frees him. As they prepare to escape, they are confronted by the killer who attacks Nick but not Kim. In the ensuing brawl, Kim strikes the killer's head with the ax. She and the killer stare at each other and Kim realizes his identity. The killer runs outside where the police have arrived. The killer collapses and is then revealed to be Alex, who explains to his sister that he witnessed their sister's death, and that Jude, Kelly, Wendy and Nick were responsible. He cries out Robin's name before dying in Kim's arms. Kim cries over the death of another sibling.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as Mr. Hammond\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Kimberly \"Kim\" Hammond\n* Casey Stevens as Nick McBride\n* [[Anne-Marie Martin|Eddie Benton]] as Wendy Richards\n* Michael Tough as Alex Hammond\n* [[Robert A.

In 2008, a [[Prom Night (2008 film)|remake]] was released, which also bears little resemblance to the 1980 film.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{ref begin|30em}}\n*{{cite av media| title=The Horrors of Hamilton High: The Making of Prom Night| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3995520/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1|last=Felsher|first=Michael (director) | type= documentary| publisher = [[Synapse Films]]/Red Shirt Pictures| year=2014|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite thesis |location=Middletown, Connecticut|type=B.A., Honors College |last=Martin |first=Charles|date=April 2016 |title=Who Watches This Stuff?!: The Place of Morality in Film Criticism |publisher=Wesleyan University|url=http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2564&context=etd_hon_theses|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|title= Blood Money: A History of the First Teen Slasher Film Cycle|first=Richard|last=Nowell|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London, England|chapter=Murder on the Dance-floor|isbn= 978-1-441-12496-8|date=December 23, 2010|ref=harv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6faoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA10&dq=prom+night+1980&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6jp3ukujRAhVq7YMKHa0MBmEQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&q=prom%20night%20&f=false}}\n*{{cite book|title=Movie/TV Soundtracks and Original Cast Recordings Price and Reference Guide|first=Jerry|last=Osborne|year=2010|publisher=Osborne Enterprises|isbn=0-932117-37-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMVP0SX35wAC&pg=PA1982-IA395&dq=Prom+Night+1980+soundtrack&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7opCBtejRAhXHzIMKHScZA88Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=Prom%20Night%201980%20soundtrack&f=false|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Rockoff|first=Adam|title=Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978\u20131986|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn= 978-0-786-46932-1|ref=harv|location=Jefferson, North Carolina}}\n*{{cite book|title=Generation Multiplex: The Image of Youth in American Cinema Since 1980|last=Shary|first=Timothy|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, Texas|date=April 1, 2014|isbn=978-0-292-75662-5|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Tadros|first=Connie|title=Paul Lynch: Working-class hero|date=March 1983|pages=20\u201324|work=[[Cinema Canada]]|ref=harv|issn=0009-7071|url=http://cinemacanada.athabascau.ca/index.php/cinema/article/viewFile/1569/1632|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020232743/http://cinemacanada.athabascau.ca/index.php/cinema/article/viewFile/1569/1632|archive-date=October 20, 2019|url-status=live}}\n*{{cite book|title=Take One's Essential Guide to Canadian Film|first=Wyndham|last=Wise|year=2001|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0-802-03512-7|ref=harv}}\n{{ref end}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0081383}}\n* {{Amg title|39485}}\n\n{{Prom Night}}\n{{Paul Lynch}}\n{{Portal bar|Speculative fiction/Horror|Film}}\n\n[[Category:1980 films]]\n[[Category:1980 horror films]]\n[[Category:1980s high school films]]\n[[Category:1980s independent films]]\n[[Category:1980s slasher films]]\n[[Category:1980s teen horror films]]\n[[Category:Abandoned buildings and structures in fiction]]\n[[Category:Canadian independent films]]\n[[Category:Canadian films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Canadian slasher films]]\n[[Category:Canadian teen films]]\n[[Category:Embassy Pictures films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about children]]\n[[Category:Films about psychopaths]]\n[[Category:Films about mass murder]]\n[[Category:Films about school violence]]\n[[Category:Films about proms]]\n[[Category:Films about twins]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Paul Lynch]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Paul Zaza]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1974]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1980]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Toronto]]\n[[Category:Fratricide in fiction]]\n[[Category:Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Prom Night (franchise)]]\n[[Category:Exploitation films]]\n", "name_user": "Anomalocaris", "label": "safe", "comment": "each interviewer separate; rm spurious close bold (''')", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prom_Night_(1980_film)"}
