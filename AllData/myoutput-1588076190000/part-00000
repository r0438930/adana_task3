It has specialist status in both the performing arts and languages. The school moved from [[Voluntary aided school|voluntary aided]] status to become an [[Academy (English school)|Academy School]] on 1 July 2011. Founded in 1880, Tiffin School educates 1,058 pupils (as of February 2019).\n\n==Admissions==\nEntry into the school is by academic selection, using both an English and a Mathematics test.<ref name=\"admissions\">{{cite web|title=Tiffin Year 7 Admissions|url=http://www.tiffinschool.co.uk/_docs/admissions/Allocation%20of%20places.pdf|accessdate=30 September 2014}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The school admits 180 students each year in year 7. Recently, students can also apply to join Tiffin for Sixth Form (Years 12 and 13), approximately 35-40% of the boys are 'new boys', from other schools. Admission to sixth form is based on GCSE results and interview performance. From September 2019, the Sixth Form became co-educational and admits around 40 girls. Tiffin remains an all boys\u2019 school from Years 7 to 11.\n\n==Identity==\nThe school colours - red and blue - date from the time of its original foundation in the 17th century. The school's coat of arms with three salmon is based on that of the [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames]]. The uniform for years 7 - 10 is in the same colours with blue and red stripes.\n\n==House system==\nThe house system was introduced by the Head Thomas Dean in the Autumn term of 1919. There were originally six houses, named after famous British explorers, but this was increased to eight on 14 March 1947 due to the expansion of the school. At the start of the academic year 1964-1965 the number of houses was reduced back to six. The names of the two newest houses were \"retained so that their identity was not lost\" according to the Tiffinian Magazine, but no reason was given as to why they were joined with Gordon and Kingsley. The reason for the change was the reduction in the size of the school imposed by the LEA. In 2016 the school added two new houses; Darwin-Wilberforce and Turing-Nightingale.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! House !! House Colour !!

Boys in the upper sixth are appointed prefects. When on duty, the head boy wears a blue gown and the senior prefects and assistant prefects a red gown.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tiffin School.jpg|thumb|left|Tiffin School Main building, taken from the Head's Garden.]]\nTwo prosperous [[brewer]]s from Kingston, John and Thomas Tiffin, left money in their wills in 1638 for the education of local people. At first the money was used for [[scholarship]]s to attend local schools. However, the fund grew through investment returns and additional donations, so by the 1820s nearly 110 children were benefiting from the fund.\n\nBy 1869, when the charity schools had closed and the money was no longer needed by the Public Secondary School, the charity's trustees proposed to support [[Kingston Grammar School]]. There was a debate until 1872 when it was decided that Kingston Grammar School should receive no more than a quarter of the income from the charity. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nPlans were therefore drawn up in 1874 for two new schools; Tiffin Boys' School and [[Tiffin Girls' School]], each taking 150 pupils. A single building by the Fairfield housing both schools was opened in January 1880.<ref name=\"Royal Kingston\">{{cite web|title=Tiffin School|url=http://www.kingston.gov.uk/browse/leisure/museum/events_and_activities/heritageopendays/tiffin_school.htm|accessdate=30 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219174116/http://www.kingston.gov.uk/browse/leisure/museum/events_and_activities/heritageopendays/tiffin_school.htm|archive-date=19 February 2012|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1929, the Boys' School moved to its present site, in Queen Elizabeth Road near the centre of Kingston.<ref name=\"Royal Kingston\"/> It became a grammar school under the Education Act 1944. The school changed from being voluntary-controlled to being [[Grant-maintained school|grant-maintained]] in 1992. On 1 July 2011 the school achieved Academy status.\n\n===New buildings===\nIn 1937, a new building was opened for the Girls' School for 480 pupils, they had previously been in the same building as the Boys' School.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times|articlename=\u00a342,000 School Opened at Kingston|section=News in Brief|day_of_week=Thursday|date=28 October 1937|page_number=21|issue=47827|column=A}}</ref>\n\nThe school site has expanded and now has a Sports Centre, Performing Arts Centre, South Building, Judge Lecture Theatre and Learning Resource Centre (named the Dempsey Centre after a former head). The Sports Centre is used for exams and indoor sports activities. The Performing Arts Centre is used for the teaching of Drama, Art, Music and Design and Technology. The South Building is used for the teaching of Mathematics, English and Modern Foreign Languages. The Judge Lecture Theatre is used as a lecture theatre for external events and internal classes. The Learning Resource Centre is used as a library,IT suite and career development office.\n\nIn 2011, an all-weather [[AstroTurf]] pitch was erected on part of the old grass field, funded by Jim Dixon and a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] grant. The [[cricket nets]] were refurbished and named the Neil Desai cricket nets in honour of his passing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tiffinfriends.org/design/pdfs/TiffinianAssociationBulletin21.pdf|title=tiffinfriends.org|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOver the course of late 2017 and early 2018, a new building attached onto the existing Dempsey Centre was opened. This was funded by the government (\u00a33,000,000). An additional \u00a3250,000 was raised with donations from former pupils and former teachers. In this building, a new IT room was installed, a brand new canteen and 6 new maths classrooms. The old canteen on this site was subsequently demolished prior to build. This has meant there is less space for on site car parking and recreational play during lunchtimes and breaks. There are further plans to expand the sports changing room of the Sports Centre. This is due to the need of a refurbishment and an additional changing room for girls, which will be attending the school for the first time in its history in September 2019. These plans are due to be carried out in March 2019 and will be funded by the government (\u00a32,000,000).\n\n==Present day==\n[[File:DempseyCentre.JPG|right|thumb|The Dempsey Centre]]\nThere are between 180 and 190 boys in each year, and about 340 in the Sixth Form, taught by  65 teaching staff.<ref>{{cite web|title=Staff List|url=http://tiffinschool.co.uk/index.php?mod=page&page=Staff%20List}}</ref>\nThe Dempsey Centre, named after Dr Tony Dempsey, who retired as head in 2004, was opened in September of that year.\nIt contains [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT suites]], a lecture theatre, a library and a new careers office.<ref>{{cite web|title=Learning Resource Centre|url=http://www.tiffinschool.co.uk/index.php?mod=page&page=Learning%20Resource%20Centre}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Serota Library Furniture|url=http://www.serota.co.uk/cases/tiffin.htm|access-date=11 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902004014/http://www.serota.co.uk/cases/tiffin.htm|archive-date=2 September 2008|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Sean Heslop took over as head of Tiffin School, due to the retirement of Tony Dempsey. He subsequently left the school in 2009 to take a position at Folkestone Academy. He was subsequently arrested and bailed by the Police on the charge of abusing a position of trust with a minor. He was acquitted of all charges.<ref>https://www.surreycomet.co.uk/news/14113044.former-tiffin-headteacher-released-without-charge-over-relationship-with-ex-pupil/</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Hilda Clarke became the first female head of Tiffin School. She is a former head of [[Langley Grammar School]] in [[Slough]] and former deputy head of [[Tiffin Girls' School]] in [[Kingston upon Thames]]. In November 2014 it was announced that Hilda Clarke had stepped down and was replaced by the former Deputy Head and longstanding History teacher, Mike Gascoigne.\n\n==Ofsted report==\nThe [[Office for Standards in Education|Ofsted]] report in 2002 stated that \"the school is very popular; annually, it receives around 1,300 applications for the 140 available places.

The school moved from [[Voluntary aided school|voluntary aided]] status to become an [[Academy (English school)|Academy School]] on 1 July 2011. Founded in 1880, Tiffin School educates 1,058 pupils (as of February 2019).\n\n==Admissions==\nEntry into the school is by academic selection, using both an English and a Mathematics test.<ref name=\"admissions\">{{cite web|title=Tiffin Year 7 Admissions|url=http://www.tiffinschool.co.uk/_docs/admissions/Allocation%20of%20places.pdf|accessdate=30 September 2014}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The school admits 180 students each year in year 7. Recently, students can also apply to join Tiffin for Sixth Form (Years 12 and 13), approximately 35-40% of the boys are 'new boys', from other schools. Admission to sixth form is based on GCSE results and interview performance. From September 2019, the Sixth Form became co-educational and admits around 40 girls. Tiffin remains an all boys\u2019 school from Years 7 to 11.\n\n==Identity==\nThe school colours - red and blue - date from the time of its original foundation in the 17th century. The school's coat of arms with three salmon is based on that of the [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames]]. The uniform for years 7 - 10 is in the same colours with blue and red stripes.\n\n==House system==\nThe house system was introduced by the Head Thomas Dean in the Autumn term of 1919. There were originally six houses, named after famous British explorers, but this was increased to eight on 14 March 1947 due to the expansion of the school. At the start of the academic year 1964-1965 the number of houses was reduced back to six. The names of the two newest houses were \"retained so that their identity was not lost\" according to the Tiffinian Magazine, but no reason was given as to why they were joined with Gordon and Kingsley. The reason for the change was the reduction in the size of the school imposed by the LEA. In 2016 the school added two new houses; Darwin-Wilberforce and Turing-Nightingale.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! House !! House Colour !!

Boys in the upper sixth are appointed prefects. When on duty, the head boy wears a blue gown and the senior prefects and assistant prefects a red gown.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tiffin School.jpg|thumb|left|Tiffin School Main building, taken from the Head's Garden.]]\nTwo prosperous [[brewer]]s from Kingston, John and Thomas Tiffin, left money in their wills in 1638 for the education of local people. At first the money was used for [[scholarship]]s to attend local schools. However, the fund grew through investment returns and additional donations, so by the 1820s nearly 110 children were benefiting from the fund.\n\nBy 1869, when the charity schools had closed and the money was no longer needed by the Public Secondary School, the charity's trustees proposed to support [[Kingston Grammar School]]. There was a debate until 1872 when it was decided that Kingston Grammar School should receive no more than a quarter of the income from the charity. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nPlans were therefore drawn up in 1874 for two new schools; Tiffin Boys' School and [[Tiffin Girls' School]], each taking 150 pupils. A single building by the Fairfield housing both schools was opened in January 1880.<ref name=\"Royal Kingston\">{{cite web|title=Tiffin School|url=http://www.kingston.gov.uk/browse/leisure/museum/events_and_activities/heritageopendays/tiffin_school.htm|accessdate=30 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219174116/http://www.kingston.gov.uk/browse/leisure/museum/events_and_activities/heritageopendays/tiffin_school.htm|archive-date=19 February 2012|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1929, the Boys' School moved to its present site, in Queen Elizabeth Road near the centre of Kingston.<ref name=\"Royal Kingston\"/> It became a grammar school under the Education Act 1944. The school changed from being voluntary-controlled to being [[Grant-maintained school|grant-maintained]] in 1992. On 1 July 2011 the school achieved Academy status.\n\n===New buildings===\nIn 1937, a new building was opened for the Girls' School for 480 pupils, they had previously been in the same building as the Boys' School.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times|articlename=\u00a342,000 School Opened at Kingston|section=News in Brief|day_of_week=Thursday|date=28 October 1937|page_number=21|issue=47827|column=A}}</ref>\n\nThe school site has expanded and now has a Sports Centre, Performing Arts Centre, South Building, Judge Lecture Theatre and Learning Resource Centre (named the Dempsey Centre after a former head). The Sports Centre is used for exams and indoor sports activities. The Performing Arts Centre is used for the teaching of Drama, Art, Music and Design and Technology. The South Building is used for the teaching of Mathematics, English and Modern Foreign Languages. The Judge Lecture Theatre is used as a lecture theatre for external events and internal classes. The Learning Resource Centre is used as a library,IT suite and career development office.\n\nIn 2011, an all-weather [[AstroTurf]] pitch was erected on part of the old grass field, funded by Jim Dixon and a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] grant. The [[cricket nets]] were refurbished and named the Neil Desai cricket nets in honour of his passing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tiffinfriends.org/design/pdfs/TiffinianAssociationBulletin21.pdf|title=tiffinfriends.org|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOver the course of late 2017 and early 2018, a new building attached onto the existing Dempsey Centre was opened. This was funded by the government (\u00a33,000,000). An additional \u00a3250,000 was raised with donations from former pupils and former teachers. In this building, a new IT room was installed, a brand new canteen and 6 new maths classrooms. The old canteen on this site was subsequently demolished prior to build. This has meant there is less space for on site car parking and recreational play during lunchtimes and breaks. There are further plans to expand the sports changing room of the Sports Centre. This is due to the need of a refurbishment and an additional changing room for girls, which will be attending the school for the first time in its history in September 2019. These plans are due to be carried out in March 2019 and will be funded by the government (\u00a32,000,000).\n\n==Present day==\n[[File:DempseyCentre.JPG|right|thumb|The Dempsey Centre]]\nThere are between 180 and 190 boys in each year, and about 340 in the Sixth Form, taught by  65 teaching staff.<ref>{{cite web|title=Staff List|url=http://tiffinschool.co.uk/index.php?mod=page&page=Staff%20List}}</ref>\nThe Dempsey Centre, named after Dr Tony Dempsey, who retired as head in 2004, was opened in September of that year.\nIt contains [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT suites]], a lecture theatre, a library and a new careers office.<ref>{{cite web|title=Learning Resource Centre|url=http://www.tiffinschool.co.uk/index.php?mod=page&page=Learning%20Resource%20Centre}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Serota Library Furniture|url=http://www.serota.co.uk/cases/tiffin.htm|access-date=11 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902004014/http://www.serota.co.uk/cases/tiffin.htm|archive-date=2 September 2008|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Sean Heslop took over as head of Tiffin School, due to the retirement of Tony Dempsey. He subsequently left the school in 2009 to take a position at Folkestone Academy. He was subsequently arrested and bailed by the Police on the charge of abusing a position of trust with a minor. He was acquitted of all charges.<ref>https://www.surreycomet.co.uk/news/14113044.former-tiffin-headteacher-released-without-charge-over-relationship-with-ex-pupil/</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Hilda Clarke became the first female head of Tiffin School. She is a former head of [[Langley Grammar School]] in [[Slough]] and former deputy head of [[Tiffin Girls' School]] in [[Kingston upon Thames]]. In November 2014 it was announced that Hilda Clarke had stepped down and was replaced by the former Deputy Head and longstanding History teacher, Mike Gascoigne.\n\n==Ofsted report==\nThe [[Office for Standards in Education|Ofsted]] report in 2002 stated that \"the school is very popular; annually, it receives around 1,300 applications for the 140 available places.
