The new name was immediately recognized by the IOC, although the Olympic Committee of North Macedonia (NMOC) was not officially adopted until February 2020. The NMOC sent a delegation to the [[2020 Winter Youth Olympics]] in January 2020, but the Tokyo Games will be North Macedonia's first appearance at the Summer Olympics under its new name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1077274/ioc-approve-name-change-to-north-macedonia-national-olympic-committee|title=IOC approve name change to North Macedonia National Olympic Committee|last=Mackay|first=Duncan|date=27 March 2019|website=insidethegames.biz|access-date=4 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709163930/https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1077274/ioc-approve-name-change-to-north-macedonia-national-olympic-committee|archive-date=9 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 December 2019, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with lab data that it provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the [[Russian Anti-Doping Agency]] being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA plans to allow individually cleared [[Russian athletes at the 2020 Summer Olympics|Russian athletes]] to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they will not be permitted to compete in team sports. The title of the neutral banner has yet to be determined; WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use \"[[Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics|Olympic Athletes from Russia]]\" (OAR) as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/09/russia-banned-from-tokyo-olympics-and-football-world-cup|title=Russia banned from Tokyo Olympics and football World Cup|last=MacInnes|first=Paul|date=9 December 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=9 December 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209155622/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/09/russia-banned-from-tokyo-olympics-and-football-world-cup|archive-date=9 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/50710598|title=Russia banned for four years to include 2020 Olympics and 2022 World Cup|work=BBC Sport|date=9 December 2019|access-date=9 December 2019|language=en-GB |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211171354/https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/50710598 |archive-date=11 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2019/12/13/olympics/wada-lawyer-defends-lack-blanket-ban-russia/#.Xfknqej7S00 |title=WADA lawyer defends lack of blanket ban on Russia |date=13 December 2019 |access-date=17 December 2019 |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |work=[[The Japan Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214162048/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2019/12/13/olympics/wada-lawyer-defends-lack-blanket-ban-russia/#.Xfknqej7S00 |archive-date=14 December 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Russia later filed an appeal to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) against the WADA decision.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5756077/russia-olympic-ban-appeal/ |title=Russia Confirms It Will Appeal 4-Year Olympic Ban |date=27 December 2019 |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227213853/https://time.com/5756077/russia-olympic-ban-appeal/ |archive-date=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2020|03|12|df=}}, the following 153 [[National Olympic Committee]]s have qualified (other than through universality places in athletics and swimming, under which all 206 NOCs may send competitors regardless of qualification).\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!
