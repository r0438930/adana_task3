It is known for having passionate fans.\n\n==Formation==\n[[File:ClevelandMunicipalStadium1993Outfield.jpg|thumb|East end zone bleachers at [[Cleveland Stadium]], home to the original Dawg Pound]]\nAccording to [[Hanford Dixon]], then a [[cornerback]] with the [[Cleveland Browns|Browns]], Dixon himself gave his defensive teammates the name \"Dawgs\" to inspire them before the 1985 season. The Dawg Pound started during the 1985 training camp at [[Lakeland Community College]] in [[Kirtland, Ohio|Kirtland]]. Dixon and fellow cornerback [[Frank Minnifield]] started the idea of the pound by using the dog-versus-cat relationship between the quarterback and the defense. \"We had the idea of the quarterback being the cat, and the defensive line being the dog,\" Dixon said. \"Whenever the defense would get a regular sack or a coverage sack the defensive linemen and linebackers would bark.\" This attitude carried into the stands at the training camp, where fans started barking along with the players. Dixon and Minnifield then put up the first \"Dawg Pound\" banner in front of the bleachers before the first [[preseason]] game at old [[Cleveland Stadium]]. The bleacher section had the cheapest seats in the stadium, and its fans were already known as the most vocal. They adopted their new identity whole-heartedly, wearing [[dog]] [[nose]]s, dog [[mask]]s, bone-shaped [[hat]]s and other outlandish [[costume]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cleveland Browns: the official illustrated history |first=Ron |last=Smith |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=[[The Sporting News]] |location=St. Louis |isbn=0-89204-625-2 |page=182 }}</ref>\n\n==Notoriety==\nDawg Pound fans quickly developed a reputation for misbehavior as well as vociferousness. Team officials banned the carrying of [[dog food]] into the stadium, as bleacher fans would shower the visiting team with [[Milk-Bone]]s, along with eggs, batteries, and other objects. Dawg Pound fans also consumed hefty amounts of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], even sneaking a [[keg]] into the stadium inside of a [[doghouse]].<ref>[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/417030-six-points-before-the-dawg-pound-was-neutered Dawg Pound \"neutered\" - Bleacher Report.com]</ref> Their reputation was such that other teams' rowdy fans would often be compared to them - in 1989, when a [[Cincinnati Bengals]] game was halted by the throwing of debris at the visiting [[Seattle Seahawks]], Bengals coach [[Sam Wyche]] addressed the crowd, angrily reminding them that, \"You don't live in Cleveland, you live in Cincinnati!\" <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJMa20xXykI Wyche addresses fans - You Tube]</ref>\n\nOn at least one occasion, Dawg Pound rowdiness affected the outcome of a game. In the fourth quarter of a 1989 game against the hated [[Denver Broncos]], the rain of [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], rocks, eggs, and other debris coming down from the bleachers was endangering the safety of the players. To move the action away from the east end, referee [[Tom Dooley (American football official)|Tom Dooley]] had the teams switch sides. That put the wind at the Browns' back. The Browns won on a [[Matt Bahr]] [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] that barely cleared the crossbar.<ref>[http://www.cleveland.com/brownshistory/plaindealer/index.ssf?/browns/more/history/19891001BROWNS.html Browns vs Broncos 10-1-89 - Cleveland Plain Dealer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618004410/http://www.cleveland.com/brownshistory/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbrowns%2Fmore%2Fhistory%2F19891001BROWNS.html |date=2012-06-18 }}</ref>\n\nAt the final game at Cleveland Stadium in December 1995, members of the Dawg Pound ripped the bleachers from the stands (many having brought [[wrenches]], [[crowbar (tool)|crowbar]]s, and other tools to dislodge the seats).

The new Pound differs from the original in having two decks, but like the Dawg Pound of Cleveland Municipal Stadium, the new stadium's Dawg Pound seats are all bleachers. The Dawg Pound [[personal seat license]] was one of the most expensive in the new Stadium.\n\nThe new Pound also has official recognition from the team. The team [[trademark]]ed a Dawg Pound [[logo]], which it uses on select fan memorabilia. This logo was created by NFL Properties and is the only such logo developed for an NFL fan base by the league. It is featured on officially licensed Browns merchandise such as T-shirts, pennants, bumper stickers, etc.\n\n[[File:Dawgpoundlogo.jpg|right|thumb|222px|Original Dawg Pound logo from the team's return in 1999.]]\nThe establishment nature of the new Pound, as well as the more-sterile atmosphere of the new stadium, originally turned off some veteran fans, especially the old \"[[blue-collar]]\" fan base.  This has resulted from what was originally a player and fan movement - the Dawg Pound - having been made \"corporate,\" by the Browns organization, including trademarks, copyrights and an official \"Dawg Pound\" logo.  Also, the more sterile, corporate atmosphere at the new FirstEnergy Stadium (as opposed to the near anarchy at the old stadium in the 1960s-1990s) has been viewed by more traditionalist Browns fans and Dawg Pound season ticket holders as tarnishing the history and traditional passion of the fanbase.<ref>[http://www.chatsports.com/cleveland-browns/a/How-I-was-ejected-for-standing-in-the-Dawg-Pound-10-27-293 \"New Pound\" complaints - Chat Sports.com]</ref>\n\n===\"Bottlegate\"===\nIn a crucial late-season 2001 game against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], the Browns were driving toward the east end zone for what would have been the winning score. A controversial call on fourth down gave the Jaguars the ball. Browns' receiver [[Quincy Morgan]] had caught a pass for a first down on 4th and 1.  After [[Tim Couch]] spiked the ball on the next play, referee [[Terry McAulay]] reviewed Morgan's catch, claiming that the replay officials had buzzed him before Couch spiked the ball. (NFL Rules state that once the next play is completed, the officials cannot under any circumstances review any previous plays.) Upon reviewing the play, McAulay determined that Morgan never had control of the ball, thus the pass was incomplete, and the Jaguars were awarded the ball. Fans in the Dawg Pound began throwing plastic [[beer bottle]]s (a recently introduced concept from the team's beer sponsor, [[Miller Lite]]) and other objects on the players and officials. McAulay declared the game over and sent the teams to the locker rooms. NFL Commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] then called to override the referee's decision, sending the players back onto the field, where the Jaguars ran out the last seconds under a hail of debris.  The incident then would become known as \"Bottlegate\",<ref>[http://nesn.com/2014/01/bottlegate-referee-terry-mcauley-to-lead-super-bowl-xlviii-officiating-crew \"Bottlegate\" referee to officiate Super Bowl - NESN.com]</ref> and resulted in the immediate ban of plastic beer bottles from future Browns home games.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland19.com/story/890359/browns-ban-plastic-bottles-of-beer|title=Browns Ban Plastic Bottles Of Beer|last=Withers|first=Tom|date=2 August 2002|publisher=[[WOIO]] via [[The Associated Press]]|accessdate=18 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===\"GPODAWUND\"===\nIn October 2016, a group of Browns fans accidentally swapped two parts of a large three-part banner, causing it to read \"This is the GPODAWUND.\"  <ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ftw/2016/10/30/this-botched-gpodawund-banner-perfectly-encapsulates-the-2016-browns/93017812/ GPODAWUND?

Since construction of the new stadium, the Dawg Pound is populated by more affluent attendees compared to the generally [[blue collar]] fan base that made the Municipal Stadium's Dawg Pound famous. Baseball Hall-of-Famer [[Hank Aaron]] often attended Browns games at Municipal Stadium and would sit in the Dawg Pound among the fans, albeit incognito.<ref>Garner, Joe.

In 1995, Thompson became an unofficial spokesman for Browns fans fighting the move of the team to Baltimore.
