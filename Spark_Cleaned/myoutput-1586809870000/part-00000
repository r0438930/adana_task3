These penny coins bore the head and name of the king and the word ''Dyflin'' for Dublin. [[John of England]] was among the first [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[monarch]]s to mint coins in Ireland; these were farthings, halfpennies and pennies. It was not until the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] that Irish coins bore the [[harp]] and, later in Henry's reign, the year. In the following centuries [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[copper]] coins were issued, and at one time, metal from melted-down gun barrels was used; this was called \"gun money\". Coins issued in the 18th and 19th centuries often included the word [[Hibernia]] on the harp side. The last Irish coins issued prior to independence were during the reign of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], in 1823. Irish coins were withdrawn in 1826 following the full political union of Ireland and Britain in the [[Act of Union 1800|1800 Act of Union]]. Occasional \"fantasy\" coins were minted in the next century but these were neither [[circulation (currency)|circulated]] nor [[legal tender]].\n\nThe [[Irish Free State]] decided soon after its foundation in the 1920s to design its own [[coin]]s and [[banknote]]s. It was decided that the Irish currency would be pegged to the [[pound sterling]]. The Coinage Act, 1926<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1926/en/act/pub/0014/index.html Coinage Act, 1926]</ref> was passed as a legislative basis for the minting of coins for the state and these new coins commenced circulation on 12 December 1928. The decision was mainly for [[economic]] reasons because, in 1924, 98% of Irish exports went to [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]], while 80% of imports were from those territories. Additionally, the stability and backing of the pound sterling reassured the government that the new currency was on [[store of value|a firm foundation]] and did not weaken efforts to rebuild the country socially and economically, which was the government's first commitment. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nAs is common with [[numismatic]] [[terminology]] the side of the [[Coat of Arms of the Republic of Ireland|seal of the state]] is termed the \"[[obverse]]\"; this is often called the common side; the \"[[Obverse and reverse|reverse]]\" is the side with the denomination specific design.\n\nCoins are issued by the [[central bank]] which acts as an agent of the [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]].\n\n==The pound==\n\n==={{anchor|Free State}}<!--[[Coins of the Irish Free State]] redirects here--> Pre-decimal coins===\n\n[[File:Irish shilling coin.png|thumb|150px|Shilling coins featured a bull design.

The committee members were [[Thomas Bodkin]], Dermot O'Brien, Lucius O'Callaghan and [[Barry Egan (politician)|Barry Egan]].\n\nSome decisions were made at the outset. The [[harp]] was to be on most if not all coins, and all lettering would be in Irish. The committee decided that people associated with \"the present time\" should not feature in any designs, no doubt {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} due to the political divisions which had led to the [[Irish Civil War]]. They decided later that religious or cultural themes should be avoided in case coins became relics or medals. [[Agriculture]] was essential to the [[economy of the Republic of Ireland|economy of Ireland]] and this theme was chosen for the coins, which used designs featuring animals and birds.\n\nFinally, the harp and the words {{lang|ga|Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann}} (\"[[Irish Free State]]\") were chosen for the obverse side of coins. Images of animals and birds were presented to the chosen artists to design the reverse and they were also given pictures of the [[Dalway harp]] and [[Trinity College harp]] for guidance. Later, the [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] decided that the value of the coins should be written in numerals as well as in words, and he suggested using plants; this latter suggestion was rejected because the competition was at an advanced stage and due to the difficulty of obtaining good facsimiles of plants.\n\nThree Irish artists [[Jerome Connor]], Albert Power and [[Oliver Sheppard]] were chosen, and also the foreign artists [[Paul Manship]] (American), [[Percy Metcalfe]] (English) [[Carl Milles]] (Swedish) and Publio Morbiducci (Italian); a number of other artists were invited but did not take part. Each artist was paid and allowed to produce designs in [[plaster]] or [[metal]], with a prize for the winner. Identifying marks were removed from the designs so the committee did not know whose designs were being judged. Percy Metcalfe's designs were chosen and design modifications were added with assistance from [[Civil service of the Republic of Ireland|civil servants]] at the [[Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine|Department of Agriculture]].\n\nThe first coins were struck in 1928 and were minted at the [[Royal Mint]] in [[London]]. In 1938, following the introduction of the [[Constitution of Ireland]], the obverse of the coins was modified with the [[Irish language]] name of the State, \"[[\u00c9ire]]\", and the harp was also modified so that it wore better. The Central Bank Act, 1942 Section 58<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1942/en/act/pub/0022/index.html Central Bank Act, 1942]</ref> allowed pure [[nickel]] to be substituted with a [[cupro-nickel]] [[alloy]]. The description of the state as the \"[[Republic of Ireland]]\" did not require any change in the name on coins issued after 1948. The Coinage Act, 1950<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1950/en/act/pub/0032/index.html Coinage Act, 1950]</ref> changed the law on coinage principally with the removal of silver from coins then in existence. The final piece of primary legislation for predecimal coins was the Coinage (Amendment) Act, 1966<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1966/en/act/pub/0005/index.html Coinage (Amendment) Act, 1966]</ref> which allowed for a [[Ten shilling (Irish coin)|ten shilling coin]] to be minted and circulated. The ten shilling was the only modern circulating Irish coin not to feature the harp, to incorporate edge lettering, and to depict an actual Irishman ([[Patrick Pearse|P\u00e1draig Pearse]]), and to depict a political subject (Pearse was an Irish revolutionary and the edge lettering referred to the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]).\n\nWhile many of the Irish coins are common, particularly in lower grades, there are some notable rarities.  Most of the 1943 Florins and Half Crowns were melted down at the mint, and only small numbers were released.  Only one and two specimens, respectively, are known of the 1938 Half Crown and Penny.<ref>[http://www.irishcoinage.com/MODCAT.HTM#modhcr Catalogue of Irish Coin Prices Modern Coins 1928-1969]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n!colspan=8| <big>Summary: Pre-decimal coins</big>\n|-\n!

The redesigned smaller 10p of the 1990s is shown on the right.]]\n\nThree new designs were created in [[bronze]] for the new decimal currency by the artist [[Gabriel Hayes]], and were based upon [[manuscript]] designs of ornamental birds in [[Celtic knot]]work style. The designs of Percy Metcalfe were retained for the new five and ten pence coins, taken from the shilling and florin, respectively. The new fifty pence piece bore the image of the woodcock from the old [[Farthing (Irish coin)|farthing]]. The designs were quite simple using only figures and symbols to indicate the value; using only the letter \"P\" to denote both ''penny'' and ''pingin'' (the [[Irish language|Irish]] word for penny). \n\nIn 1978, the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] opened the [[Currency Centre]] at [[Sandyford]] in Dublin for the production of coins and banknotes. Irish coins had previously been produced in Great Britain at the [[Royal Mint]]. \n\nThe rising expense of minting coins necessitated the introduction of the [[Irish twenty pence (decimal coin)|twenty pence coin]] in 1986; the [[Irish halfpenny (decimal coin)|halfpenny coin]] was withdrawn at this time as [[inflation]] had reduced its buying power. The introduction of the [[Irish pound]] [[coin]] required the Decimal Currency Act, 1990<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0002/index.html Decimal Currency Act, 1990]</ref> and this law provided for certain other matters including the issue of [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU) coins which were specifically stated not to be [[legal tender]] in the legislation, instead intended as [[Collecting|collectors]] items. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} These ECU coins were issued in 50 ECU, 10 ECU and 5 ECU denominations, in [[gold]], [[silver]] and silver respectively. These coins used the Irish red deer design from the Irish pound coin with a mountain relief in the background and other notable differences such as the [[European symbols|12 stars of the European Flag]] surrounding the [[harp]], quite similar to the [[Irish euro coins]].\n\nThe coins issued under the Decimal Currency Acts were finally [[Legal tender#Demonetisation|withdrawn from circulation]] in 2002 by the Irish Pound Coinage (Calling In) (No. 2) Order, 2001<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/si/0311.html S.I.

As with all [[eurozone]] countries, Ireland continued to mint its own coins after the currency changeover to the euro. One side of euro coins is common across the eurozone, it is the obverse which has a design unique to Ireland. Although some other countries used more than one design, or even a separate design for each of the eight coins (1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, \u20ac1 and \u20ac2), Ireland used only one design. A redesigned [[Irish harp|harp]] (superficially identical to that used on earlier coins) was used, having been designed by Jarlath Hayes. Some other eurozone members have unique lettering around the \u20ac2 coin. The edge on Irish \u20ac2 coins merely has the sequence \"[[File:2\u20ac edge inv2.svg|155px|2 * * (upside down 2) * *]]\", repeated three times.\n\nThe first collectors' commemorative coin issued since the changeover was a \u20ac10 silver coin to mark the [[Special Olympics]] in 2003. This was struck in [[Sterling silver|sterling .925 silver]] and hand finished to create a distinctive gold logo and harp. A \u20ac5 coin was also produced. Since then a number of commemorative coins have been issued including one for the accession of the ten new [[European Union]] member states on 1 May 2004. One side of the \u20ac10 coin depicts a [[swan]] sitting on ten eggs, with the reverse depicting the harp and the names of all ten members in their native language.  The first gold coin ever issued by the Central Bank was a \u20ac20 issued in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of [[Samuel Beckett]].  These commemorative coins are only legal tender in Ireland, and are not valid elsewhere in the eurozone.\n\nIn 2007, Ireland issued a \u20ac2 common coin for general circulation, together with the others countries of the Eurozone, commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Treaty of Rome]] followed by a \u20ac2 common commemorative coin in 2009 celebrating the tenth anniversary of the birth of the euro currency in 1999, by another \u20ac2 common commemorative coin in 2012 for the tenth anniversary of the introduction of coins and banknotes denominated in euro and, finally, by another \u20ac2 common commemorative dedicated to the thirtieth anniversary of the [[Flag of Europe|European Flag]] in 2015. For the first time since it adopted the euro, Ireland will issue on its own, in 2016, a \u20ac2 commemorative coin in honour of the hundredth anniversary of the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916.\n\nIn 2013 the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] issued a silver \u20ac10 commemorative coin in honour of [[James Joyce]] that misquoted a famous line from his masterwork ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0410/380758-central-bank-coin/ | work=RT\u00c9 News | date=10 April 2013 | title=Error in Ulysses line on special \u20ac10 coin issued by Central Bank}}</ref> despite being warned on at least two occasions by the Department of Finance over difficulties with copyright and design.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.herald.ie/news/bank-alerted-to-joyce-coin-risk-29296231.html  | work= Evening Herald  |date=25 May 2013 | title=Bank alerted to Joyce coin risk}}</ref>\n\nAll pre-euro Irish coins may be exchanged for their equivalent in euro any weekday morning at the [[Central Bank of Ireland|Central Bank]] in Dublin.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Banknotes of the Republic of Ireland]]\n*[[Coins of Ireland]]\n*[[Arms of Ireland]]\n*[[Commemorative coins of Ireland]]\n*[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Ireland)]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* ''\"Coinage of Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann\", William Butler Yeats, The Stationery Office, Dublin, 1928.''\n* ''\"The Irish Coinage Designs\", Thomas Bodkin DLitt, Metropolitan School of Art, Dublin, November 30, 1928.''\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.irishcoinage.com/ Irish coinage website - history, images and catalogue.]\n\n{{Irish currency and coinage}}\n{{Portal bar|Ireland|Money|Numismatics|Republic of Ireland}}\n\n[[Category:Coins of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Coins of the Republic of Ireland| ]]\n", "text_old": "There have been three sets of [[coins of Ireland|coins in Ireland]] since independence.

The final piece of primary legislation for predecimal coins was the Coinage (Amendment) Act, 1966<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1966/en/act/pub/0005/index.html Coinage (Amendment) Act, 1966]</ref> which allowed for a [[Ten shilling (Irish coin)|ten shilling coin]] to be minted and circulated. The ten shilling was the only modern circulating Irish coin not to feature the harp, to incorporate edge lettering, and to depict an actual Irishman ([[Patrick Pearse|P\u00e1draig Pearse]]), and to depict a political subject (Pearse was an Irish revolutionary and the edge lettering referred to the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]).\n\nWhile many of the Irish coins are common, particularly in lower grades, there are some notable rarities.  Most of the 1943 Florins and Half Crowns were melted down at the mint, and only small numbers were released.  Only one and two specimens, respectively, are known of the 1938 Half Crown and Penny.<ref>[http://www.irishcoinage.com/MODCAT.HTM#modhcr Catalogue of Irish Coin Prices Modern Coins 1928-1969]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n!colspan=8| <big>Summary: Pre-decimal coins</big>\n|-\n!

The redesigned smaller 10p of the 1990s is shown on the right.]]\n\nThree new designs were created in [[bronze]] for the new decimal currency by the artist [[Gabriel Hayes]], and were based upon [[manuscript]] designs of ornamental birds in [[Celtic knot]]work style. The designs of Percy Metcalfe were retained for the new five and ten pence coins, taken from the shilling and florin, respectively. The new fifty pence piece bore the image of the woodcock from the old [[Farthing (Irish coin)|farthing]]. The designs were quite simple using only figures and symbols to indicate the value; using only the letter \"P\" to denote both ''penny'' and ''pingin'' (the [[Irish language|Irish]] word for penny). \n\nIn 1978, the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] opened the [[Currency Centre]] at [[Sandyford]] in Dublin for the production of coins and banknotes. Irish coins had previously been produced in Great Britain at the [[Royal Mint]]. \n\nThe rising expense of minting coins necessitated the introduction of the [[Irish twenty pence (decimal coin)|twenty pence coin]] in 1986; the [[Irish halfpenny (decimal coin)|halfpenny coin]] was withdrawn at this time as [[inflation]] had reduced its buying power. The introduction of the [[Irish pound]] [[coin]] required the Decimal Currency Act, 1990<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0002/index.html Decimal Currency Act, 1990]</ref> and this law provided for certain other matters including the issue of [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU) coins which were specifically stated not to be [[legal tender]] in the legislation, instead intended as [[Collecting|collectors]] items. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} These ECU coins were issued in 50 ECU, 10 ECU and 5 ECU denominations, in [[gold]], [[silver]] and silver respectively. These coins used the Irish red deer design from the Irish pound coin with a mountain relief in the background and other notable differences such as the [[European symbols|12 stars of the European Flag]] surrounding the [[harp]], quite similar to the [[Irish euro coins]].\n\nThe coins issued under the Decimal Currency Acts were finally [[Legal tender#Demonetisation|withdrawn from circulation]] in 2002 by the Irish Pound Coinage (Calling In) (No. 2) Order, 2001<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/si/0311.html S.I.

As with all [[eurozone]] countries, Ireland continued to mint its own coins after the currency changeover to the euro. One side of euro coins is common across the eurozone, it is the obverse which has a design unique to Ireland. Although some other countries used more than one design, or even a separate design for each of the eight coins (1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, \u20ac1 and \u20ac2), Ireland used only one design. A redesigned [[Irish harp|harp]] (superficially identical to that used on earlier coins) was used, having been designed by Jarlath Hayes. Some other eurozone members have unique lettering around the \u20ac2 coin. The edge on Irish \u20ac2 coins merely has the sequence \"[[File:2\u20ac edge inv2.svg|155px|2 * * (upside down 2) * *]]\", repeated three times.\n\nThe first collectors' commemorative coin issued since the changeover was a \u20ac10 silver coin to mark the [[Special Olympics]] in 2003. This was struck in [[Sterling silver|sterling .925 silver]] and hand finished to create a distinctive gold logo and harp. A \u20ac5 coin was also produced. Since then a number of commemorative coins have been issued including one for the accession of the ten new [[European Union]] member states on 1 May 2004. One side of the \u20ac10 coin depicts a [[swan]] sitting on ten eggs, with the reverse depicting the harp and the names of all ten members in their native language.  The first gold coin ever issued by the Central Bank was a \u20ac20 issued in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of [[Samuel Beckett]].  These commemorative coins are only legal tender in Ireland, and are not valid elsewhere in the eurozone.\n\nIn 2007, Ireland issued a \u20ac2 common coin for general circulation, together with the others countries of the Eurozone, commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Treaty of Rome]] followed by a \u20ac2 common commemorative coin in 2009 celebrating the tenth anniversary of the birth of the euro currency in 1999, by another \u20ac2 common commemorative coin in 2012 for the tenth anniversary of the introduction of coins and banknotes denominated in euro and, finally, by another \u20ac2 common commemorative dedicated to the thirtieth anniversary of the [[Flag of Europe|European Flag]] in 2015. For the first time since it adopted the euro, Ireland will issue on its own, in 2016, a \u20ac2 commemorative coin in honour of the hundredth anniversary of the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916.\n\nIn 2013 the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] issued a silver \u20ac10 commemorative coin in honour of [[James Joyce]] that misquoted a famous line from his masterwork ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0410/380758-central-bank-coin/ | work=RT\u00c9 News | date=10 April 2013 | title=Error in Ulysses line on special \u20ac10 coin issued by Central Bank}}</ref> despite being warned on at least two occasions by the Department of Finance over difficulties with copyright and design.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.herald.ie/news/bank-alerted-to-joyce-coin-risk-29296231.html  | work= Evening Herald  |date=25 May 2013 | title=Bank alerted to Joyce coin risk}}</ref>\n\nAll pre-euro Irish coins may be exchanged for their equivalent in euro any weekday morning at the [[Central Bank of Ireland|Central Bank]] in Dublin.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Banknotes of the Republic of Ireland]]\n*[[Coins of Ireland]]\n*[[Arms of Ireland]]\n*[[Commemorative coins of Ireland]]\n*[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Ireland)]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* ''\"Coinage of Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann\", William Butler Yeats, The Stationery Office, Dublin, 1928.''\n* ''\"The Irish Coinage Designs\", Thomas Bodkin DLitt, Metropolitan School of Art, Dublin, November 30, 1928.''\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.irishcoinage.com/ Irish coinage website - history, images and catalogue.]\n\n{{Irish currency and coinage}}\n{{Portal bar|Ireland|Money|Numismatics|Republic of Ireland}}\n\n[[Category:Coins of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Coins of the Republic of Ireland| ]]\n", "name_user": "Iveagh Gardens", "label": "safe", "comment": "Tags and links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coins_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland"}
