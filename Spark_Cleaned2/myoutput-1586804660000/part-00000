Conrad played at [[San Diego State University]] in 1994 and 1995, and then transferred to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. While playing for UCLA, he was a member of the 1997 [[NCAA Men's Soccer Championship|NCAA Championship]] team.\n\n===Professional===\nUndrafted by MLS, Conrad had an unsuccessful trial with the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]].  However, the Galaxy coaching staff recommended he play for one of their affiliated lower division teams.  Consequently, Conrad contacted the now-defunct [[San Diego Flash]] of the [[USL First Division|A-League]] which gave him a contract.  In 1999, [[Brian Quinn (soccer)|Brian Quinn]] became the head coach of the [[San Jose Clash]].

Conrad's stock rose while with Kansas City; never a big scorer, he tallied four goals during his first season (he has ten in his MLS career). In 2004, he helped the Wizards to the [[US Open Cup]] and the MLS Cup Final as the leader of the league's stingiest defense and was named to the league's [[MLS Best XI|Best XI]] and was a finalist for [[MLS Defender of the Year Award]]. He won the award a year later.\n\nDespite rumors of a possible European transfer following the Wizards' disappointing 2006 season, Conrad renewed his contract with the Wizards beginning the 2007 season, and new head coach [[Curt Onalfo]] rewarded him the club captaincy.\n\nConrad was out of contract after the [[2010 MLS season]] and elected to participate in the [[2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft]].
