Although he was the second son, Theobald was appointed above his older brother [[William, Count of Sully|William]]. Several historians have painted William as mentally deficient, but this has never been substantiated. However, we know that his mother found him stubbornly resistant to control and unfit for wide-ranging comital duties. Theobald had no such problems. Theobald accompanied his mother throughout their domain on hundreds of occasions and, after her retirement to Marcigney in 1125, he administered the family properties with great skill.

The war, which lasted two years (1142\u20131144), was marked by the occupation of [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] by the royal army and the capture of [[Vitry-le-Fran\u00e7ois]], where many persons perished in the deliberate burning of the church by Louis.
