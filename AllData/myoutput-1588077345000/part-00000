The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], as well as events in [[Christianity in the 1st century|first-century Christianity]]. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as [[Religious text|sacred scripture]].\n\nThe New Testament is a collection of Christian texts originally written in the [[Koine Greek]] language, at different times by various different authors. While the Old Testament canon varies somewhat between different [[Christian denomination]]s, the [[Development of the New Testament canon|27-book canon]] of the New Testament has been almost universally recognized within [[Christianity]] since at least [[Late Antiquity]]. Thus, in almost all Christian traditions today, the New Testament consists of 27 books: \n* 4 [[Canonical Gospels]] ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]])\n* the [[Acts of the Apostles]]\n* 14 [[Pauline epistles|Epistles of Paul]]\n* 7 [[General Epistles]], and\n* the [[Book of Revelation]].\n\nThe earliest known complete list of the 27 books of the New Testament is found in a letter written by [[Athanasius]], a 4th-century [[bishop]] of [[Alexandria]], dated to 367 AD.<ref name=\"LindbergCarter\">{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Christianity |first=Carter |last=Lindberg |page=15|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=978-1-4051-1078-5}}</ref> The 27-book New Testament was first formally canonized during the councils of [[Council of Hippo|Hippo]] (393) and [[Council of Carthage|Carthage]] (397) in North Africa. [[Pope]] [[Innocent I]] ratified the same canon in 405, but it is probable that a Council in Rome in 382 under [[Pope Damasus I]] gave the same list first. These councils also provided the canon of the Old Testament, which included the [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]] books.<ref>Introduction to the New Testament. Werner Georg Kummel. Abingdon Press. Nashville. 1993.</ref>\n\nThere is no [[scholarly consensus]] on the date of composition of the latest New Testament texts. Conservative scholars [[John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich)#Redating the New Testament (1976)|John A. T. Robinson]], [[Daniel B. Wallace|Dan Wallace]], and [[William F.

[[Lactantius]], a 3rd\u20134th century Christian author wrote in his early-4th-century Latin ''Institutiones Divinae'' (''Divine Institutes''):<ref>Lactantius. \"Chapter XX\".

The Jews make use of the Old, we of the New: but yet they are not discordant, for the New is the fulfilling of the Old, and in both there is the same testator, even Christ, who, having suffered death for us, made us heirs of His everlasting kingdom, the people of the Jews being deprived and disinherited. As the prophet Jeremiah testifies when he speaks such things: \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new testament to the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they continued not in my testament, and I disregarded them, saith the Lord.\"{{Bibleref2c|Jer|31:31\u201332}}  ...

The word \"gospel\" derives from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''g\u014dd-spell''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Gospel |title=Gospel |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref> (rarely ''godspel''), meaning \"good news\" or \"glad tidings\". The gospel was considered the \"good news\" of the coming [[Messiah#Christianity|Kingdom of Messiah]], and the redemption through the life and death of Jesus, the central Christian message.<ref name=\"ODCC self Gospel\">Cross, F. L., ed (2005). \"Gospel\". The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> Gospel is a [[calque]] (word-for-word translation) of the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}}, ''euangelion'' (''eu-'' \"good\", ''-angelion'' \"message\").\n\nStarting in the late second century, the four narrative accounts of the life and work of Jesus Christ have been referred to as \"The Gospel of ...\" or \"The Gospel according to ...\" followed by the name of the supposed author. The first author to explicitly name the canonical gospels is [[Irenaeus]] of Lyon,<ref name=\"trobisch-2012\"/><ref>[[Irenaeus]], ''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103311.htm Against Heresies]'' III.11</ref> who promoted the four canonical gospels in his book [[Against Heresies (Irenaeus)|Against Heresies]], written around 180.<ref>Due to its reference to [[Eleutherus]] as the current [[bishop of Rome]], the work is usually dated {{circa|lk=no|180}}.

Eerdmans Publishing Company]].</ref> Whatever these admittedly early ascriptions may imply about the sources behind or the perception of these gospels, they are anonymous compositions.\n* The [[Gospel of Matthew]], ascribed to the [[Matthew the Evangelist|Apostle Matthew]]. This gospel begins with a [[genealogy of Jesus]] and a story of his birth that includes a visit from [[Biblical Magi|magi]] and a [[flight into Egypt]], and it ends with the [[Great Commission|commissioning of the disciples]] by the resurrected Jesus.\n* The [[Gospel of Mark]], ascribed to [[Mark the Evangelist]]. This gospel begins with the preaching of [[John the Baptist]] and the [[baptism of Jesus]]. Two different secondary endings were affixed to this gospel in the 2nd century.\n* The [[Gospel of Luke]], ascribed to [[Luke the Evangelist]], who was not one of [[Twelve Disciples#The Twelve Apostles|the Twelve Apostles]], but was mentioned as a companion of the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]] and as a physician.<ref>Fitzmyer, Joseph A. (1985). ''The Gospel according to Luke, Vol. 1''. Anchor Bible Commentary series. New York: Doubleday. pp. 35\u201353.</ref> This gospel begins with parallel stories of the birth and childhood of [[John the Baptist]] and [[Jesus]] and ends with appearances of the resurrected Jesus and his ascension into heaven.\n* The [[Gospel of John]], ascribed to [[John the Evangelist]]. This gospel begins with a philosophical prologue and ends with appearances of the resurrected Jesus.\n\nThe first three gospels listed above are classified as the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. They contain similar accounts of the events in Jesus's life and his teaching, due to their literary interdependence. The Gospel of John is structured differently and includes stories of several miracles of Jesus and sayings not found in the other three.\n\nThese four gospels that were eventually included in the New Testament were only a few among many other early Christian gospels. The existence of such texts is even mentioned at the beginning of the Gospel of Luke.{{Bibleref2c|Luke|1:1\u20134}} Other early Christian gospels, such as the so-called \"[[Jewish-Christian Gospels]]\" or the [[Gospel of Thomas]], also offer both a window into the context of [[early Christianity]] and may provide some assistance in the reconstruction of the [[historical Jesus]].\n\n===Acts of the Apostles===\nThe [[Acts of the Apostles]] is a narrative of the apostles' ministry and activity after [[Christ's death]] and resurrection, from which point it resumes and functions as a sequel to the [[Gospel of Luke]]. Examining style, phraseology, and other evidence, modern scholarship generally concludes that Acts and the Gospel of Luke share the same author, referred to as [[Luke\u2013Acts]]. Luke-Acts does not name its author.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=196}} Church tradition identified him as [[Luke the Evangelist]], the companion of Paul, but the majority of scholars reject this due to the many differences between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|p=235}} The most probable date of composition is around 80\u2013100 AD, although some scholars date it significantly later,<ref name=\"pervo\"/><ref name=\"trobisch-2007\"/> and there is evidence that it was still being substantially revised well into the 2nd century.{{sfn|Perkins|2009|pp=250\u201353}}\n\n===Epistles===\nThe epistles of the New Testament are considered by Christians to be divinely inspired and holy letters, written by the apostles and disciples of Christ, to either local congregations with specific needs, or to [[New Covenant]] Christians in general, scattered about; or \"catholic epistles.\"\n\n====Pauline letters to churches====\n{{Main|Pauline epistles}}\nThe Pauline letters to churches are the thirteen New Testament books that present [[Paul the Apostle]] as their author.{{refn|group=note|[[Joseph Barber Lightfoot]] in his ''Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians'' writes: \"At this point [{{Bibleref2|Gal|6:11}}] the apostle takes the pen from his [[amanuensis]], and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. From the time when letters began to be forged in his name ({{bibleref2|2 Thess|2:2||2 Thess. 3:17}}; {{bibleref2-nb|2 Thess|3:17||2 Thess. 3:17}}) it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such forgeries.... In the present case he writes a whole paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed sentences. He writes it, too, in large, bold characters (Gr. ''pelikois grammasin''), that his handwriting may reflect the energy and determination of his soul.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Lightfoot |first=Joseph Barber |year=1866 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8ECAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA217 |title=St Paul's Epistle to the Galatians |edition=2nd |publisher=MacMillan & Co |page=217}}</ref>}} Six of the letters are disputed. Four are thought by most modern scholars to be [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]], i.e., not actually written by Paul even if attributed to him within the letters themselves.

They include the following:\n* [[First Epistle to Timothy]]<sup>*</sup>\n* [[Second Epistle to Timothy]]<sup>*</sup>\n* [[Epistle to Titus]]<sup>*</sup>\n* [[Epistle to Philemon]]\n[Disputed letters are marked with an asterisk (*).]\n\nAll of the above except for Philemon are known as the [[Pastoral epistles]]. They are addressed to individuals charged with pastoral oversight of churches and discuss issues of Christian living, doctrine and leadership. They often address different concerns to those of the preceding epistles. These letters are believed by many to be pseudepigraphic. Some scholars (e.g., Bill Mounce, Ben Witherington) will argue that the letters are genuinely Pauline, or at least written under Paul's supervision.\n\n====Hebrews====\nThe [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] addresses a Jewish audience who had come to believe that Jesus was the [[Messiah#Judaism|anointed one]] (Hebrew: \u05de\u05b8\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05d7\u05b7\u2014transliterated in English as \"Moshiach\", or \"Messiah\"; Greek: \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2\u2014transliterated in English as \"Christos\", for \"[[Christ]]\") who was predicted in the writings of the Hebrew Scriptures. The author discusses the superiority of the new covenant and the ministry of Jesus, to the [[Mosaic covenant]] {{Bibleref2c|Heb.|1:1\u201310:18}} and urges the readers in the practical implications of this conviction through the end of the epistle.{{Bibleref2c|Heb.|10:19\u201313:25}}\n\nThe book has been widely accepted by the Christian church as inspired by God and thus authoritative, despite the acknowledgment of uncertainties about who its human author was. Regarding authorship, although the Epistle to the Hebrews does not internally claim to have been written by the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]], some similarities in wordings to some of the Pauline Epistles have been noted and inferred. In antiquity, some began to ascribe it to Paul in an attempt to provide the anonymous work an explicit apostolic pedigree.<ref>[[Harold W. Attridge|Attridge, Harold W.]] (1989). ''Hebrews''. Hermeneia. Philadelphia: Fortress. pp. 1\u20136.</ref>\n\nIn the 4th century, [[Jerome]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] supported [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles|Paul's authorship]]. The Church largely agreed to include Hebrews as the fourteenth letter of Paul, and affirmed this authorship until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. The letter to the Hebrews had difficulty in being accepted as part of the Christian canon because of its anonymity.<ref>[[William L. Lane|Lane, William L.]] (1991). ''Hebrews 1\u20138''.

Oxford University Press. p. 323. \"Scholars in the ancient world went about detecting forgeries in much the same way that modern scholars do. They looked to see whether the ideas and writing style of a piece conformed with those used by the author in other writings, and they examined the text for any blatant anachronisms, that is, statements about things that could not have existed at the time the alleged author was writing (like the letter reputedly from an early seventeenth-century American colonist that mentions \"the United States\")- Arguments of this kind were used by some Christian scholars of the third century to show that Hebrews was not written by Paul or the Book of Revelation by John the son of Zebedee. Modern scholars, as we will see, concur with these judgments. To be sure, neither of these books can be considered a forgery. Hebrews does not claim to be written by Paul (it is anonymous), and the John who wrote Revelation does not claim to be the son of Zebedee (it is therefore homonymous).

In the Latin West, prior to the [[Vulgate]] (an early 5th-century Latin version of the Bible), the four Gospels were arranged in the following order: Matthew, John, Luke, and Mark.{{refn|group=note|The Gospels are in this order in many Old Latin manuscripts, as well as in the Greek manuscripts [[Codex Bezae]] and [[Codex Washingtonianus]].}} The Syriac [[Peshitta]] places the major Catholic epistles (James, 1 Peter, and 1 John) immediately after Acts and before the Pauline epistles.\n\nThe order of an early edition of the letters of Paul is based on the size of the letters: longest to shortest, though keeping 1 and 2 Corinthians and 1 and 2 Thessalonians together. The Pastoral epistles were apparently not part of the ''Corpus Paulinum'' in which this order originated and were later inserted after 2 Thessalonians and before Philemon. Hebrews was variously incorporated into the ''Corpus Paulinum'' either after 2 Thessalonians, after Philemon (i.e. at the very end), or after Romans.\n\nThe New Testament of the 16th-century [[Luther Bible]] continues, to this day, to place Hebrews, James, Jude, and the Apocalypse last. This reflects the thoughts of the Reformer Martin Luther [[Luther's canon|on the canonicity of these books]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/links10.html|title=Web Directory: German Bible Versions|publisher=Bible Research|accessdate=17 February 2016}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|See also the article on the [[Antilegomena]].}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Apocrypha==\n{{Main|New Testament apocrypha}}\nThe books that eventually found a permanent place in the New Testament were not the only works of Christian literature produced in the earliest Christian centuries. The long process of [[Development of the New Testament canon|canonization]] began early, sometimes with tacit reception of traditional texts, sometimes with explicit selection or rejection of particular texts as either acceptable or unacceptable for use in a given context (e.g., not all texts that were acceptable for private use were considered appropriate for use in the [[liturgy]]).\n\nOver the course of history, those works of early Christian literature that survived but that did not become part of the New Testament have been variously grouped by theologians and scholars. Drawing upon, though redefining, an older term used in [[early Christianity]] and among Protestants when referring to those books found in the Christian [[Old Testament]] although not in the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]], modern scholars began to refer to these works of early Christian literature not included in the New Testament as \"apocryphal\", by which was meant non-canonical.\n\nCollected editions of these works were then referred to as the \"[[New Testament apocrypha]]\". Typically excluded from such published collections are the following groups of works: [[Apostolic Fathers|The Apostolic Fathers]], the 2nd-century Christian apologists, [[Alexandrian school|the Alexandrians]], [[Tertullian]], [[Methodius of Olympus]], [[Novatian]], [[Cyprian]], martyrdoms, and [[Desert Fathers|the Desert Fathers]]. Almost all other Christian literature from the period, and sometimes including works composed well into [[Late Antiquity]], are relegated to the so-called New Testament apocrypha.\n\nAlthough not considered to be inspired by God, these \"apocryphal\" works were produced in the same ancient context and often using the same language as those books that would eventually form the New Testament. Some of these later works are dependent (either directly or indirectly) upon books that would later come to be in the New Testament or upon the ideas expressed in them. There is even an example of a [[pseudepigraph]]ical letter composed under the guise of a presumably lost letter of the Apostle Paul, the [[Epistle to the Laodiceans]].\n\n==Authors==\n{{Main|Authorship of the Bible}}\nThe books of the New Testament were all or nearly all written by [[Jewish Christians]]\u2014that is, Jewish disciples of Christ, who lived in the [[Roman Empire]], and under [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman occupation]].<ref>{{harvp|Powell|2009|p=16}}</ref> Luke, who wrote the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts, is frequently thought of as an exception; scholars are divided as to whether Luke was a Gentile or a [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic Jew]].<ref name=\"Strelan2013\">Strelan, Rick (2013).

Most scholars think Paul actually dictated his letters to a secretary.]]\nThe Pauline epistles are the thirteen books in the New Testament traditionally attributed to [[Paul of Tarsus]]. The anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews is, despite unlikely Pauline authorship, often functionally grouped with these thirteen to form a corpus of fourteen \"Pauline\" epistles.{{refn|group=note|Although Hebrews was almost certainly not written by Paul, it has been a part of the Pauline corpus \"from the beginning of extant MS production\".<ref name=hebot01>{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Daniel B. |url=https://bible.org/seriespage/19-hebrews-introduction-argument-and-outline |title=Hebrews: Introduction, Argument, and Outline |publisher=Bible.org |date=28 June 2004}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven letters are generally classified as \"undisputed\", expressing contemporary scholarly near consensus that they are the work of Paul: Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians and Philemon. Six additional letters bearing Paul's name do not currently enjoy the same academic consensus: Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus.{{refn|group=note|name=\"Lock, Meinertz p.622\"|Guthrie lists: ohlenberg, Lock, Meinertz, Thornell, Schlatter, Spicq, [[Jeremais|Jeremias]], Simpson, Kelly, and Fee\"<ref>{{harvp|Guthrie|1990|p=622}}</ref>}}\n\nWhile many scholars uphold the traditional view, some question whether the first three, called the \"Deutero-Pauline Epistles\", are authentic letters of Paul.

Since the early centuries of the church, there has been debate concerning the authorship of the anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews, and contemporary scholars generally reject Pauline authorship.<ref name=\"Ehrman 2004\"/>\n\nThe epistles all share common themes, emphasis, vocabulary and style; they exhibit a uniformity of doctrine concerning the [[Ten Commandments|Mosaic Law]], Jesus, faith, and various other issues. All of these letters easily fit into the chronology of Paul's journeys depicted in Acts of the Apostles.\n\n===Other epistles===\nThe author of the [[Epistle of James]] identifies himself in the opening verse as \"James, a servant of [[God]] and of the Lord [[Jesus]] Christ\". From the middle of the 3rd century, [[patristic]] authors cited the ''Epistle'' as written by [[James the Just]].<ref>[http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/j/james,epistle_of_st.html \"Epistle of St. James\"].

Unlike [[The Second Epistle of Peter]], the authorship of which was debated in antiquity, there was little debate about Peter's authorship of this first epistle until the 18th century.

The author has traditionally been identified with [[John the Apostle]] to whom the [[Gospel of John|Gospel]] and the [[epistles of John]] were attributed. It was believed that he was exiled to the island of Patmos during the reign of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Domitian]], and there wrote Revelation. [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 100\u2013165 AD) who was acquainted with [[Polycarp]], who had been mentored by John, makes a possible allusion to this book, and credits John as the source.<ref>Justin Martyr. ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. Chapter LXXXI.</ref> [[Irenaeus]] (c. 115\u2013202) assumes it as a conceded point. According to the ''Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible'', modern scholars are divided between the apostolic view and several alternative hypotheses put forth in the last hundred years or so.<ref>Tenney, Merrill C., gen. ed.

Explicit references to NT books in extra-biblical documents can push this upper limit down a bit further. [[Irenaeus]] of Lyon names and quotes from most of the books in the New Testament in his book [[Against Heresies (Irenaeus)|''Against Heresies'']], written around 180 AD. The [[Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians]], written some time between 110 and [[Polycarp|Polycarp's death]] in 155-167 AD, quotes or alludes to most New Testament texts. [[Ignatius of Antioch]] wrote letters referencing much of the New Testament. He lived from about 35AD to 107AD and is rumored to have been a disciple of the Apostle John. His writings reference the Gospels of John, Matthew, and Luke, as well as Peter, James, and Paul\u2019s Episltes. His writing is usually attributed to the end of his lifetime, which places the Gospels as First Century writings.\n\n===Internal evidence===\nLiterary analysis of the New Testament texts themselves can be used to date many of the books of the New Testament to the mid- to late first century. The earliest works of the New Testament are the letters of the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]]. It can be determined that [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|1 Thessalonians]] is likely the earliest of these letters, written around 52 AD.<ref name=\"Brown\">[[Raymond E.

In the initial centuries of [[early Christianity]], there were many books widely considered by the church to be inspired, but there was no single formally recognized New Testament canon.<ref>Eusebius. \"Chapter 25\". [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm ''Church History, Book III''].</ref> The process was characterized by a compilation of books that [[Sacred tradition|apostolic tradition]] considered authoritative in worship and teaching, relevant to the historical situations in which they lived, and consonant with the Old Testament.<ref>Gamble, Harry Y. (1985). ''The New Testament Canon: Its Making and Meaning''. Guides to Biblical Scholarship. Philadelphia: Fortress.</ref> Writings attributed to the apostles circulated among the [[Early centers of Christianity|earliest Christian communities]] and the Pauline epistles were circulating, perhaps in collected forms, by the end of the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century AD]].<ref>Three forms are postulated, from ''The Canon Debate'', chapter 18, p. 300, note 21, attributed to Harry Y. Gamble: \"(1) Marcion's collection that begins with Galatians and ends with Philemon; (2) Papyrus 46, dated about 200, that follows the order that became established except for reversing Ephesians and Galatians; and (3) the letters to seven churches, treating those to the same church as one letter and basing the order on length, so that Corinthians is first and Colossians (perhaps including Philemon) is last.\"</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest attempts at solidifying a canon was made by [[Marcion]], ''circa'' 140 AD, who accepted only a modified version of Luke (the [[Gospel of Marcion]]) and ten of Paul's letters, while rejecting the Old Testament entirely. His canon was largely rejected by other groups of Christians, notably the [[Proto-orthodox Christianity|proto-orthodox Christians]], as was his theology, [[Marcionism]]. [[Adolf von Harnack]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Harnack |first=Adolf |chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/origin_nt.v.vi.html |title=Origin of the New Testament |chapter=Appendix VI |publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library}}</ref> John Knox,<ref name=\"knox\">{{cite book | last = Knox | first = John | title = Marcion and the New Testament: An Essay in the Early History of the Canon | publisher = Chicago University Press | location = Chicago | date = 1942 | pages = 158ff | isbn = 978-0404161835}}</ref> and [[David Trobisch]],<ref name=\"trobisch-2007\"/> among other scholars, have argued that the church formulated its New Testament canon partially in response to the challenge posed by Marcion.\n\n[[Polycarp]],<ref>[[Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians]], [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0136.htm Chapter 12]</ref> [[Irenaeus]]<ref>''[[Against Heresies (Irenaeus)|Against Heresies]]'', inter alia, 3.12.12</ref> and [[Tertullian]]<ref>''Adversus Marcionem'', inter alia, V.14</ref> held the [[Pauline epistles|epistles of Paul]] to be divinely inspired \"scripture.\" Other books were held in high esteem but were gradually relegated to the status of [[New Testament apocrypha]].

The information used to create the late-4th-century [[Easter Letter]], which declared accepted Christian writings, was probably based on the ''Ecclesiastical History'' [HE] of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], wherein he uses the information passed on to him by Origen to create both his list at HE 3:25 and Origen's list at HE 6:25. Eusebius got his information about what texts were then accepted and what were then [[Antilegomena|disputed]], by the [[Early centers of Christianity|third-century churches throughout the known world]], a great deal of which Origen knew of firsthand from his extensive travels, from the library and writings of Origen.<ref>Bateman, C.

First then must be put the holy quaternion of the gospels; following them the Acts of the Apostles... the epistles of Paul... the epistle of John... the epistle of Peter... After them is to be placed, if it really seem proper, the Book of Revelation, concerning which we shall give the different opinions at the proper time. These then belong among the accepted writings.\"\n\n: \"3 Among the disputed writings, which are nevertheless recognized by many, are extant the so-called epistle of James and that of Jude, also the second epistle of Peter, and those that are called the second and third of John, whether they belong to the evangelist or to another person of the same name. Among the rejected [Kirsopp Lake translation: \"not genuine\"] writings must be reckoned also the [[Acts of Paul]], and the so-called [[Shepherd of Hermas|Shepherd]], and the [[Apocalypse of Peter]], and in addition to these the extant [[epistle of Barnabas]], and the so-called [[Didache|Teachings of the Apostles]]; and besides, as I said, the [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse of John]], if it seem proper, which some, as I said, reject, but which others class with the accepted books. And among these some have placed also the [[Gospel of the Hebrews|Gospel according to the Hebrews]]... And all these may be reckoned among the disputed books.\"\n\n: \"6... such books as the [[Gospel of Peter|Gospels of Peter]], of [[Gospel of Thomas|Thomas]], of [[Gospel of Matthias|Matthias]], or of any others besides them, and the [[Acts of Andrew]] and [[Acts of John|John]] and the other apostles... they clearly show themselves to be the fictions of heretics. Wherefore they are not to be placed even among the rejected writings, but are all of them to be cast aside as absurd and impious.\"\n\nThe Book of Revelation is counted as both accepted (Kirsopp Lake translation: \"Recognized\") and disputed, which has caused some confusion over what exactly Eusebius meant by doing so. From other writings of the church fathers, it was disputed with several canon lists rejecting its canonicity. EH 3.3.5 adds further detail on Paul: \"Paul's fourteen epistles are well known and undisputed. It is not indeed right to overlook the fact that some have rejected the Epistle to the Hebrews, saying that it is disputed by the church of Rome, on the ground that it was not written by Paul.\" EH 4.29.6 mentions the [[Diatessaron]]: \"But their original founder, Tatian, formed a certain combination and collection of the gospels, I know not how, to which he gave the title Diatessaron, and which is still in the hands of some. But they say that he ventured to paraphrase certain words of the apostle Paul, in order to improve their style.\"\n\n===4th century and later===\nIn his Easter letter of 367, [[Athanasius]], Bishop of Alexandria, gave a list of the books that would become the twenty-seven-book NT canon,<ref name=\"LindbergCarter\"/> and he used the word \"canonized\" (''kanonizomena'') in regards to them.<ref>Brakke, David (Oct 1994). \"Canon Formation and Social Conflict in Fourth Century Egypt: Athanasius of Alexandria's Thirty Ninth Festal Letter\".

Certain books, referred to as [[Antilegomena]], continued to be questioned, especially [[Epistle of James|James]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]. Even as late as the 16th century, the Reformer [[Martin Luther]] questioned (but in the end did not reject) the [[Epistle of James]], the [[Epistle of Jude]], the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] and the [[Book of Revelation]]. To this day, German-language [[Luther Bible]]s are printed with these four books at the end of the canon, rather than in their traditional order as in other editions of the Bible.\n\nIn light of this questioning of the canon of Scripture by Protestants in the 16th century, the (Roman Catholic) [[Council of Trent]] reaffirmed the traditional western canon (i.e., the canon accepted at the 4th-century [[Council of Rome]] and [[Council of Carthage]]), thus making the [[Canon of Trent]] and the [[Vulgate]] Bible [[Roman Catholic Dogma|dogma]] in the Catholic Church. Later, [[Pope Pius XI]] on 2 June 1927 decreed the [[Comma Johanneum]] was open to dispute and [[Pope Pius XII]] on 3 September 1943 issued the encyclical ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'', which allowed translations based on other versions than just the Latin [[Vulgate]], notably in English the [[New American Bible]].\n\nThus, some claim that, from the [[Christianity in the 4th century#Defining scripture|4th century]], there existed unanimity in the [[Western Church|West]] concerning the New Testament canon (as it is today),<ref>{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=215}}</ref> and that, by the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]], the [[Eastern Church]], with a few exceptions, had come to accept the [[Book of Revelation]] and thus had come into harmony on the matter of the canon.<ref name=\"P.

Peabody, Massachusetts: Hendrickson. p. 116.</ref>\n{{quote|\nAlthough a number of Christians have thought that [[church council]]s determined what books were to be included in the biblical canons, a more accurate reflection of the matter is that the councils recognized or acknowledged those books that had already obtained prominence from usage among the various early Christian communities.}}\n\nChristian scholars assert that when these bishops and councils spoke on the matter, they were not defining something new, but instead \"were ratifying what had already become the mind of the Church\".<ref name=\"Metzger 1987 237\u2013238\"/><ref name=\"Bruce\" />\n\nSome synods of the 4th century published lists of canonical books (e.g. [[Synod of Hippo|Hippo]] and [[Council of Carthage|Carthage]]). The existing 27-book canon of the New Testament was reconfirmed (for [[Roman Catholicism]]) in the 16th century with the [[Council of Trent]] (also called the Tridentine Council) of 1546,<ref>{{harvp|Metzger|1987|p=246}} \"Finally on 8 April 1546, by a vote of 24 to 15, with 16 abstensions, the Council issued a decree (''De Canonicis Scripturis'') in which, for the first time in the history of the church, the question of the contents of the Bible was made an absolute article of faith and confirmed by an anathema.\"</ref> the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of 1563 for the [[Church of England]], the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] of 1647 for [[Calvinism]], and the [[Synod of Jerusalem]] of 1672 for [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Although these councils did include statements about the canon, when it came to the New Testament they were only reaffirming the existing canon, including the [[Antilegomena]].\n\nAccording to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' article on the Canon of the New Testament: \"The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning, that is from Apostolic times, has no foundation in history. The Canon of the New Testament, like that of the Old, is the result of a development, of a process at once stimulated by disputes with doubters, both within and without the Church, and retarded by certain obscurities and natural hesitations, and which did not reach its final term until the dogmatic definition of the [[Council of Trent|Tridentine Council]].\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Reid |first=George |year=1908 |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03274a.htm |chapter=Canon of the New Testament |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company}}</ref>\n\nIn 331, [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine I]] commissioned Eusebius to deliver [[Fifty Bibles of Constantine|fifty Bibles]] for the [[Church of Constantinople]]. [[Athanasius]] (''Apol. Const. 4'') recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for [[Constans]]. Little else is known, though there is plenty of speculation. For example, it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for canon lists, and that [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]] may be examples of these Bibles. Together with the [[Peshitta]] and [[Codex Alexandrinus]], these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.<ref>{{harvp|McDonald|Sanders|2002|pp=414\u2013415}}</ref> There is no evidence among the [[First Council of Nicaea#The biblical canon|canons of the First Council of Nicaea of any determination on the canon]].\n\n==Early manuscripts==\n[[File:Papyrus Bodmer VIII.jpg|thumb|Papyrus Bodmer VIII, at the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, showing 1 and 2 Peter.]]\n[[File:Codex Regius (019).JPG|thumb|The [[Codex Regius (New Testament)|Codex Regius (L or '''019''')]], an 8th-century Greek manuscript of the New Testament with strong affinities to [[Codex Vaticanus]].]]\n{{Main|New Testament manuscripts}}\n\nLike other literature from [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], the text of the New Testament was (prior to the advent of the [[printing press]]) preserved and transmitted in [[manuscripts]]. Manuscripts containing at least a part of the New Testament number in the thousands. The earliest of these (like manuscripts containing other literature) are often very fragmentarily preserved. Some of these fragments have even been thought to date as early as the 2nd century (i.e., [[Papyrus 90]], [[Papyrus 98]], [[Papyrus 104]], and famously [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], though the early date of the latter has recently been called into question).<ref>For the initial dating of P52, see Roberts, C.

Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 590\u2013623.</ref>\n\nFor each subsequent century, more and more manuscripts survive that contain a portion or all of the books that were held to be part of the New Testament at that time (for example, the New Testament of the 4th-century [[Codex Sinaiticus]], once a complete Bible, contains the [[Epistle of Barnabas]] and the [[Shepherd of Hermas]]), though occasionally these manuscripts contain other works as well (e.g., [[Papyrus 72]] and the Crosby-Sch\u00f8yen Codex). The date when a manuscript was written, however, does not necessarily reflect the date of the form of text it contains. That is, later manuscripts can, and occasionally do, contain older forms of text or older readings.\n\nSome of the more important manuscripts containing an early text of books of the New Testament are:\n\n*The [[Chester Beatty Papyri]] (Greek; the New Testament portions of which were copied in the 3rd century)\n*The [[Bodmer Papyri]] (Greek and Coptic; the New Testament portions of which were copied in the 3rd and 4th centuries)\n*[[Codex Bobiensis]] (Latin; copied in the 4th century, but containing at least a 3rd-century form of text)\n*[[Uncial 0171|Uncial '''0171''']] (Greek; copied in the late-third or early 4th century)\n*[[Syriac Sinaiticus]] (Syriac; copied in the 4th century)\n*[[Schoyen Collection|Sch\u00f8yen Manuscript]] 2560 (Coptic; copied in the 4th century)\n*[[Codex Vaticanus]] (Greek; copied in the 4th century)\n*[[Codex Sinaiticus]] (Greek; copied in the 4th century)\n*[[Codex Vercellensis]] (Latin; copied in the 4th century)\n*[[Curetonian Gospels]] (Syriac; copied in the 5th century)\n*[[Garima Gospels]] ( [[Ge'ez language]], produced in the 5th through 6th century)\n\n==Textual variation==\n{{Main|Textual variants in the New Testament|Textual criticism of the New Testament}}\n[[Textual criticism]] deals with the identification and removal of [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] errors in the [[Writing|texts]] of [[manuscripts]]. Ancient [[scribes]] made errors or alterations (such as including non-authentic [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|additions]]).<ref>{{harvp|Ehrman|2005|p=46}}</ref> The New Testament has been preserved in more than 5,800 [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts, 10,000 [[Latin]] manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Ethiopic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. Even if the [[Greek New Testament|original Greek]] versions were lost, the entire New Testament could still be assembled from the translations.<ref name=\"Strobel, Lee 1998\">Strobel, Lee (1998). ''The Case for Christ''. Chapter Three, when quoting biblical scholar [[Bruce Metzger]].</ref>\n\nIn addition, there are so many quotes from the New Testament in early church documents and commentaries that the entire New Testament could also be assembled from these alone.<ref name=\"Strobel, Lee 1998\"/> Not all biblical manuscripts come from orthodox Christian writers. For example, the [[Gnostic]] writings of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] come from the 2nd century AD, and these Christians were regarded as heretics by the mainstream church.<ref name=\"Bruce, F.F. 1981 P 14\">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=F.F. |year=1981 |title=The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable? |publisher=InterVarsity Press |page=14 |ref=harv}}</ref> The sheer number of witnesses presents unique difficulties, but it also gives scholars a better idea of how close modern Bibles are to the original versions.<ref name=\"Bruce, F.F. 1981 P 14\"/>\n\nOn noting the large number of surviving ancient manuscripts, [[Bruce Metzger]] sums up the view on the issue by saying \"The more often you have copies that agree with each other, especially if they emerge from different geographical areas, the more you can cross-check them to figure out what the original document was like. The only way they'd agree would be where they went back genealogically in a family tree that represents the descent of the manuscripts.<ref name=\"Strobel, Lee 1998\"/>\n\n===Interpolations===\nIn attempting to determine the original text of the New Testament books, some modern textual critics have identified sections as additions of material, centuries after the gospel was written. These are called [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]]. In modern translations of the Bible, the results of textual criticism have led to certain verses, words and phrases being left out or marked as not original. According to [[Bart D. Ehrman]], \"These scribal additions are often found in late medieval manuscripts of the New Testament, but not in the manuscripts of the earlier centuries.\"<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |last=Ehrman |first=Bart D. |authorlink=Bart D.

Bible Commentaries also discuss these, sometimes in great detail. While many variations have been discovered between early copies of biblical texts, almost all have no importance, as they are variations in spelling, punctuation, or grammar. Also, many of these variants are so particular to the Greek language that they would not appear in translations into other languages. For example, order of words (i.e. \"man bites dog\" versus \"dog bites man\") often does not matter in Greek, so textual variants that flip the order of words often have no consequences.<ref name=\"Strobel, Lee 1998\"/>\n\nOutside of these unimportant variants, there are a couple variants of some importance.

Vol. 4. pp. 594\u2013595.{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}</ref> Most of the variation took place within the first three Christian centuries.\n\n===Text-types===\nBy the 4th century, textual \"families\" or types of text become discernible among [[biblical manuscript|New Testament manuscripts]]. A \"text-type\" is the name given to a family of texts with similar readings due to common ancestors and mutual correction. Many early manuscripts, however, contain individual readings from several different earlier forms of text. Modern texual critics have identified the following text-types among textual witnesses to the New Testament: The [[Alexandrian text-type]] is usually considered to generally preserve many early readings. It is represented, e.g., by [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]], [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and the [[Bodmer Papyri]].\n\nThe [[Western text-type]] is generally longer and can be paraphrastic, but can also preserve early readings. The [[Acts of the Apostles#Manuscripts|Western version of the Acts of the Apostles]] is, notably, 8.5% longer than the Alexandrian form of the text. Examples of the Western text are found in [[Codex Bezae]], [[Codex Claromontanus]], [[Codex Washingtonianus]], the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] (i.e., Latin translations made prior to the [[Vulgate]]), as well as in quotations by [[Marcion]], [[Tatian]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Cyprian]].\n\nA text-type referred to as the \"[[Caesarean text-type]]\" and thought to have included witnesses such as [[Codex Koridethi]] and minuscule 565, can today be described neither as \"Caesarean\" nor as a text-type as was previously thought. However, the Gospel of Mark in [[Papyrus 45]], [[Codex Washingtonianus]] and in [[Family 13]] does indeed reflect a distinct type of text.\n\nIncreasing standardization of distinct (and once local) text-types eventually gave rise to the [[Byzantine text-type]]. Since most manuscripts of the New Testament do not derive from the first several centuries, that is, they were copied after the rise of the Byzantine text-type, this form of text is found the majority of extant manuscripts and is therefore often called the \"Majority Text.\" As with all of the other (earlier) text-types, the Byzantine can also occasionally preserve early readings.\n\n===Biblical criticism===\n{{Main|Biblical criticism}}\n[[Biblical criticism]] is the scholarly \"study and investigation of [[Biblical manuscript|biblical writings]] that seeks to make discerning judgments about these writings.\" Viewing biblical texts as having human rather than supernatural origins, it asks when and where a particular text originated; how, why, by whom, for whom, and in what circumstances it was produced; what influences were at work in its production; what sources were used in its composition; and what message it was intended to convey.\n\nIt will vary slightly depending on whether the focus is on the [[Old Testament]], the letters of the New Testament, or the [[Canonical Gospels]]. It also plays an important role in the quest for the [[historical Jesus]]. It also addresses the physical text, including the meaning of the words and the way in which they are used, its preservation, history, and integrity. Biblical criticism draws upon a wide range of scholarly disciplines including [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[folklore]], [[linguistics]], [[Christian Oral Tradition|Oral Tradition studies]], history, and [[religious studies]].\n\n===Establishing a critical text===\n{{Main|New Testament manuscripts}}\nThe [[#Textual variation|textual variation]] among manuscript copies of books in the New Testament prompted attempts to discern the earliest form of text already in antiquity (e.g., by the 3rd-century Christian author [[Origen]]). The efforts began in earnest again during the [[Renaissance]], which saw a revival of the study of ancient Greek texts. During this period, modern [[textual criticism]] was born. In this context, [[Christian humanism|Christian humanists]] such as [[Lorenzo Valla]] and [[Erasmus]] promoted a return to the original Greek of the New Testament. This was the beginning of modern [[New Testament textual criticism]], which over subsequent centuries would increasingly incorporate more and more manuscripts, in more languages (i.e., versions of the New Testament), as well as citations of the New Testament by ancient authors and the New Testament text in [[lectionary|lectionaries]] in order to reconstruct the earliest recoverable form of the New Testament text and the history of changes to it.<ref>[[Bruce M. Metzger|Metzger, Bruce M.]]; [[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]] (2005). ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration''. 4th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\n==Relationship to earlier and contemporaneous literature==\n{{Further|Non-canonical books referenced in the Bible}}\nBooks that later formed the New Testament, like other Christian literature of the period, originated in a literary context that reveals relationships not only to other Christian writings, but also to [[Classics|Graeco-Roman]] and [[Judaism#Antiquity|Jewish]] works. Of singular importance is the extensive use of and interaction with the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]] and what would become the [[Old Testament|Christian Old Testament]]. Both implicit and explicit citations, as well as countless allusions, appear throughout the books of the New Testament, from the Gospels and Acts, to the Epistles, to the Apocalypse.<ref>See, e.g., Stendahl, Krister (1954).

The earliest versions of the New Testament are the translations into the [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Latin]], and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] languages.<ref>[[Arthur V\u00f5\u00f5bus|V\u00f5\u00f5bus, Arthur]] (1954).

Stockholm. pp. 1\u2013128, 211\u2013240.</ref> These three versions were made directly from the Greek, and are frequently cited in the apparatuses of modern critical editions.\n\n===Syriac===\n{{Main|Syriac versions of the Bible}}\n[[File:RabulaGospelsFolio04vCanonTable.jpg|thumb|The [[Rabbula Gospels]], [[Eusebian Canons]].]]\nSyriac was spoken in [[Syria]], and [[Mesopotamia]], and with dialect in [[Syria Palaestina|Roman]] and [[Palaestina Secunda|Byzantine Palestine]] where it was known as [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]]. Several Syriac translations were made and have come to us. Most of the Old Syriac, however, as well as the Philoxonian version have been lost.\n\n[[Tatian]], the Assyrian, created the [[Diatessaron]], a [[gospel harmony]] written in Syriac around 170 AD and the earliest form of the gospel not only in Syriac but probably also in Armenian.\n\nIn the 19th century, manuscript evidence was discovered for an \"Old Syriac\" version of the four distinct (i.e., not harmonized) gospels. These \"separated\" (Syriac: ''da-Mepharreshe'') gospels, though old, have been shown to be later than the Diatessaron. The Old Syriac gospels are fragmentarily preserved in two manuscripts: the 5th-century [[Curetonian Gospels|Curetonian Syriac]] and the [[Syriac Sinaiticus|Sinaitic Syriac]] from the 4th or 5th century.\n\nNo Old Syriac manuscripts of other portions of the New Testament survive, though Old Syriac readings, e.g. from the [[Pauline Epistles]], can be discerned in citations made by Eastern fathers and in later Syriac versions. The Old Syriac version is a representative of the [[Western text-type]]. The [[Peshitta]] version was prepared in the beginning of the 5th century. It contains only 22 books (neither the [[General epistles|Minor Catholic Epistles]] of 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, and Jude, nor the [[Book of Revelation]] were part of this translation).\n\nThe [[Philoxenian]] probably was produced in 508 for [[Philoxenus, Bishop of Mabung]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Metzger |first=Bruce M. |authorlink=Bruce M.

Not much later, there were also European Latin translations (''Itala''). There are about 80 Old Latin mansucripts. The [[Vetus Latina]] (\"Old Latin\") versions often contain readings with a Western type of text. (For the avoidance of confusion, these texts were written in [[Late Latin]], not the early version of the Latin language known as [[Old Latin]], pre 75 BC.)\n\nThe bewildering diversity of the Old Latin versions prompted [[Jerome]] to prepare another translation into Latin\u2014the [[Vulgate]]. In many respects it was merely a revision of the Old Latin. There are currently around 8,000 manuscripts of the Vulgate.\n\n===Coptic===\n{{Main|Coptic versions of the Bible}}\nThere are several dialects of the Coptic language: [[Bohairic]] (northern dialect), [[Fayyumic]], [[Sahidic]] (southern dialect), [[Akhmimic]], and others. The first translation was made by at least the 3rd century into the Sahidic dialect (cop<sup>sa</sup>). This translation represents a mixed text, mostly [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]], though also with [[Western text-type|Western]] readings.<ref>{{cite book |last=V\u00f6\u00f6bus |first=Arthur |year=1954 |title=Early Versions of the New Testament |location=Stockholm |pages=216\u2013229 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nA Bohairic translation was made later, but existed already in the 4th century. Though the translation makes less use of Greek words than the Sahidic, it does employ some Greek grammar (e.g., in word-order and the use of particles such as the syntactic construction \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u2014\u03b4\u03b5). For this reason, the Bohairic translation can be helpful in the reconstruction of the early Greek text of the New Testament.<ref>{{harvp|V\u00f6\u00f6bus|1954|pp=229\u2013237}}; {{harvp|Metzger|1977|pp=99\u2013152}}</ref>\n\n===Other ancient translations===\n[[File:Matthew's Gospel - British Library Add. MS 59874 Ethiopian Bible.jpg|thumb|BL Add. MS 59874 with [[Ethiopic]] [[Gospel of Matthew]].]]\nThe continued spread of Christianity, and the foundation of national churches, led to the translation of the Bible\u2014often beginning with books from the New Testament\u2014into a variety of other languages at a relatively early date: [[Bible translations into Armenian|Armenian]], [[Bible translations into Georgian|Georgian]], [[Ethiopic]], [[Bible translations into Persian|Persian]], [[Bible translations into Sogdian|Sogdian]], and eventually [[Gothic Bible|Gothic]], [[Bible translations into Church Slavonic|Old Church Slavonic]], [[Bible translations into Arabic|Arabic]], and [[Bible translations into Nubian|Nubian]].<ref>On the Armenian, Georgian, Ethiopic, Arabic, and Gothic, see {{harvp|V\u00f6\u00f6bus|1954|loc=pp. 133\u2013210, 243\u2013309}}</ref>\n\n==Modern translations==\n{{Main|Bible translations}}\n\nHistorically, throughout the [[Christendom|Christian world]] and in the context of [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missionary activity]], the New Testament (or portions thereof) has been that part of the Christian Bible first translated into the [[vernacular]]. The production of such translations grew out of the insertion of [[vernacular]] [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] in biblical texts, as well as out of the production of [[biblical paraphrase]]s and poetic renditions of stories from the life of Christ (e.g., the [[Heliand]]).\n\nThe 16th century saw the rise of [[Protestantism]] and an explosion of translations of the New (and Old) Testament into the [[vernacular]]. Notable are those of [[Luther Bible|Martin Luther]] (1522), [[Jacques Lef\u00e8vre d'\u00c9taples]] (1523), the [[Z\u00fcrich Bible|Froschau Bible]] (1525\u20131529, revised in 1574), [[Tyndale Bible|William Tyndale]] (1526, revised in 1534, 1535 and 1536), the [[Brest Bible]] (1563), and the [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized Version]] (also called the \"King James Version\") (1611).\n\nMost of these translations relied (though not always exclusively) upon one of the printed editions of the Greek New Testament edited by [[Erasmus]], a form of this Greek text emerged as the standard and is known as the [[Textus Receptus]]. This text, based on the majority of manuscripts is also used in the majority of translations that were made in the years 100 to 400 AD.\n\nTranslations of the New Testament made since the appearance of critical editions of the Greek text (notably those of [[Constantin von Tischendorf|Tischendorf]], [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]], and [[Von Soden catalogue|von Soden]]) have largely used them as their [[Source text|base text]]. Unlike the [[Textus Receptus]], these have a pronounced Alexandrian character. Standard critical editions are those of [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-\u00c5land]] (the text, though not the full critical apparatus of which is reproduced in the [[United Bible Societies]]' \"Greek New Testament\"), [[Alexander Souter|Souter]], Vogels, Bover and Merk.\n\nNotable translations of the New Testament based on these most recent critical editions include the [[Revised Standard Version]] (1946, revised in 1971), [[:fr:La Bible de J\u00e9rusalem|La Bible de J\u00e9rusalem]] (1961, revised in 1973 and 2000), the [[Einheits\u00fcbersetzung]] (1970, final edition 1979), the [[New American Bible]] (1970, revised in 1986), the [[Traduction Oecum\u00e9nique de la Bible]] (1988, revised in 2004), and the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (1989).\n\n==Theological interpretation in Christian churches==\n{{Main|Biblical authority}}\nThough all Christian churches accept the New Testament as scripture, they differ in their understanding of the nature, extent, and relevance of its authority. Views of the authoritativeness of the New Testament often depend on the concept of ''[[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]]'', which relates to the role of God in the formation of the New Testament. Generally, the greater the role of God in one's doctrine of inspiration, the more one accepts the [[doctrine]] of [[biblical inerrancy]] or authoritativeness of the Bible. One possible source of confusion is that these terms are difficult to define, because many people use them interchangeably or with very different meanings. This article will use the terms in the following manner:\n*''Infallibility'' relates to the absolute correctness of the Bible in matters of doctrine.\n*''Inerrancy'' relates to the absolute correctness of the Bible in factual assertions (including historical and scientific assertions).\n*''Authoritativeness'' relates to the correctness of the Bible in questions of practice in morality.\n\n{{Quotation|The self-witness of the Bible to its inspiration demands a commitment to its unity. The ultimate basis for unity is contained in the claim of divine inspiration in {{Bibleref2|2tim|3:16||2&nbsp;Timothy 3:16}} that \"all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness\" (KJV). The term \"inspiration\" renders the Greek word ''theopneustos''. This term only occurs here in the New Testament and literally means \"God-breathed\" (the chosen translation of the NIV).<ref name=Elwell>Meadors, Gary T. (1997). [http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/bakers-evangelical-dictionary/scripture-unity-and-diversity-of.html \"Scripture, Unity and Diversity of\"]. In Elwell, Walter A. (ed.). ''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology.'' Grand Rapids: Baker Books.</ref>  }}\n\nAll of these concepts depend for their meaning on the supposition that the text of Bible has been properly interpreted, with consideration for the intention of the text, whether [[literal and figurative language|literal]] history, [[allegory]] or poetry, etc. Especially the doctrine of inerrancy is variously understood according to the weight given by the interpreter to scientific investigations of the world.\n\n===Unity in diversity===\nThe notion of unity in diversity of Scripture claims that the Bible presents a noncontradictory and consistent message concerning God and redemptive history. The fact of diversity is observed in comparing the diversity of time, culture, authors' perspectives, literary genre, and the theological themes.<ref name=Elwell/>\n\nStudies from many theologians considering the \"unity in diversity\" to be found in the New Testament (and the Bible as a whole) have been collected and summarized by New Testament theologian [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]]. He describes them as some basic presuppositions, tenets, and concerns common among the New Testament writers, giving to the New Testament its \"unity in diversity\":\n#The reality of God is never argued but is always assumed and affirmed\n#Jesus Christ is absolutely central: he is Lord and Savior, the foretold Prophet, the Messianic King, the Chosen, the way, the truth, and the light, the One through whom God the Father not only acted but through whom He came\n#The Holy Spirit came anew with Jesus Christ.\n#The Christian faith and life are a calling, rooted in divine election.\n#The plight of everyone as sinner means that each person is completely dependent upon the mercy and grace of God\n#Salvation is both God's gift and his demand through Jesus Christ, to be received by faith\n#The death and resurrection of Jesus are at the heart of the total event of which he was the center\n#God creates a people of his own, designated and described by varied terminology and analogies\n#History must be understood eschatologically, being brought along toward its ultimate goal when the kingdom of God, already present in Christ, is brought to its complete triumph\n#In Christ, all of God's work of creation, revelation, and redemption is brought to fulfillment<ref name=Stagg>Stagg, Frank (1962). ''New Testament Theology''. Broadman. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}.</ref>\n\n===Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Classical Anglicanism===\nFor the [[Roman Catholic Church]], there are two modes of Revelation: Scripture and [[Apostolic Tradition|Tradition]]. Both of them are interpreted by the teachings of the Church. The Roman Catholic view is expressed clearly in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] (1997):\n<blockquote>\n\u00a7 82: As a result the Church, to whom the transmission and interpretation of Revelation is entrusted, does not derive her certainty about all revealed truths from the holy Scriptures alone. Both Scripture and Tradition must be accepted and honoured with equal sentiments of devotion and reverence.\n<br />\n\u00a7 107: The inspired books teach the truth. Since therefore all that the inspired authors or sacred writers affirm should be regarded as affirmed by the Holy Spirit, we must acknowledge that the books of Scripture firmly, faithfully, and without error teach that truth which God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to see confided to the Sacred Scriptures.\n</blockquote>In Catholic terminology the teaching office is called the [[Magisterium]].  The Catholic view should not be confused with the two-source theory.  As the Catechism states in \u00a7\u00a7 80 and 81, Revelation has \"one common source ... two distinct modes of transmission.\"<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c2a2.htm \"The Transmission of Divine Revelation\"]. ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''. 2nd ed. 1997.</ref>\n\nWhile many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] writers distinguish between Scripture and Tradition, Bishop Kallistos Ware says that for the Orthodox there is only one source of the Christian faith, Holy Tradition, within which Scripture exists.<ref>Ware, Kallistos (1993). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2Z8bVDVMLEC&pg=PT243 \"Holy Tradition: The Source of the Orthodox Faith\"].''The Orthodox Church''. Penguin UK.</ref>\n\nTraditional [[Anglican Communion|Anglicans]] believe that \"Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation\", (Article VI), but also that the Catholic Creeds \"ought thoroughly to be received and believed\" (Article VIII), and that the Church \"hath authority in Controversies of Faith\" and is \"a witness and keeper of Holy Writ\" (Article XX).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html |title=Articles of Religion |publisher=Anglicans Online |accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref> Classical Anglicanism, therefore, like Orthodoxy, holds that Holy Tradition is the only safe guardian against perversion and innovation in the interpretation of Scripture.\n\nIn the famous words of Thomas Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells: \"As for my religion, I dye in the holy catholic and apostolic faith professed by the whole Church before the disunion of East and West, more particularly in the communion of the Church of England, as it stands distinguished from all Papal and Puritan innovations, and as it adheres to the doctrine of the Cross.\"\n\n===Protestantism===\nFollowing the doctrine of [[sola scriptura]], Protestants believe that their traditions of faith, practice and interpretations carry forward what the scriptures teach, and so tradition is not a source of authority in itself. Their traditions derive authority from the Bible, and are therefore always open to reevaluation. This openness to doctrinal revision has extended in [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal]] Protestant traditions even to the reevaluation of the doctrine of Scripture upon which the Reformation was founded, and members of these traditions may even question whether the Bible is infallible in doctrine, inerrant in historical and other factual statements, and whether it has uniquely divine authority. However, the adjustments made by modern [[Protestantism|Protestants]] to their doctrine of scripture vary widely.\n\n====American evangelical and fundamentalist Protestantism====\nWithin the US, the [[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]] (1978) is a statement, articulating evangelical views on this issue. Paragraph four of its summary states: \"Being wholly and verbally God-given, Scripture is without error or fault in all its teaching, no less in what it states about God's acts in creation, about the events of world history, and about its own literary origins under God, than in its witness to God's saving grace in individual lives.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/documents/index.html?mainframe=http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html |title=The Chicago Statement of Biblical Inerrancy |publisher=Center for Reformed Theology and Apologetics |accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n====American mainline and liberal Protestantism====\n[[Mainline (Protestant)|Mainline]] American [[Protestant]] denominations, including the [[United Methodist Church]], [[Presbyterian Church USA]], [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|The Episcopal Church]], and [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], do not teach the doctrine of inerrancy as set forth in the Chicago Statement. All of these churches have more ancient doctrinal statements asserting the authority of scripture, but may interpret these statements in such a way as to allow for a very broad range of teaching\u2014from evangelicalism to skepticism. It is not an impediment to ordination in these denominations to teach that the scriptures contain errors, or that the authors follow a more or less unenlightened ethics that, however appropriate it may have seemed in the authors' time, moderns would be very wrong to follow blindly.\n\nFor example, [[ordination of women]] is universally accepted in the mainline churches, [[abortion]] is condemned as a grievous social tragedy but not always a personal [[sin]] or a crime against an unborn person, and [[homosexuality]] is sometimes recognized as a genetic propensity or morally neutral preference that should be neither encouraged nor condemned. In North America, the most contentious of these issues among these churches at the present time is how far the ordination of gay men and lesbians should be accepted.\n\nOfficials of the Presbyterian Church USA report: \"We acknowledge the role of scriptural authority in the Presbyterian Church, but Presbyterians generally do not believe in biblical inerrancy. Presbyterians do not insist that every detail of chronology or sequence or prescientific description in scripture be true in literal form. Our confessions do teach biblical infallibility. Infallibility affirms the entire truthfulness of scripture without depending on every exact detail.\"<ref>\"Homosexual ordination vote widens gap between Presbyterian factions\". ''ReligionToday''. 20 June 2001.</ref>\n\nThose who hold a more liberal view of the Bible as a human witness to the glory of God, the work of fallible humans who wrote from a limited experience unusual only for the insight they have gained through their inspired struggle to know God in the midst of a troubled world. Therefore, they tend not to accept such doctrines as inerrancy. These churches also tend to retain the social activism of their evangelical forebears of the 19th century, placing particular emphasis on those teachings of scripture that teach compassion for the poor and concern for [[social justice]].\n\nThe message of personal [[salvation]] is, generally speaking, of the good that comes to oneself and the world through following the New Testament's [[ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] admonition to love others without hypocrisy or prejudice. Toward these ends, the \"spirit\" of the New Testament, more than the letter, is infallible and authoritative.\n\nThere are some movements that believe the Bible contains the teachings of Jesus but who reject the churches that were formed following its publication. These people believe all individuals can communicate directly with God and therefore do not need guidance or doctrines from a church. These people are known as [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]].\n\n===Messianic Judaism===\n[[Messianic Judaism]] generally holds the same view of New Testament authority as evangelical Protestants.<ref name = \"Beit Simcha\">{{cite web\n | url         = http://www.beitsimcha.org/our-beliefs/\n | title       = Our Beliefs\n | publisher   = Beit Simcha\n | accessdate  = 7 June 2012\n | quote       = To study the whole and authoritative Word of God, including the Tenach (Hebrew Scriptures) and the B'rit Chadasha (New Covenant) under the leading of the Holy Spirit.\n}}\n</ref> According to the view of some Messianic Jewish congregations, Jesus did not annul the Torah, but that its interpretation is revised and ultimately explained through the Apostolic Scriptures.<ref name=\"KehilatTNuvahSOF1\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.graftedin.com/essential-statement-of-faith/\n |title       = Essential Statement of Faith\n |accessdate  = 7 June 2012\n |publisher   = The Harvest: A Messianic Charismatic Congregation\n |quote       = We believe that the Torah (five books of Moses) is a comprehensive summary of God's foundational laws and ways, as found in both the Tanakh and Apostolic Scriptures.

They also view the New Testament as the primary instruction guide for Christian living, and [[church discipline]].

Therefore, the fourth commandment concerning the Sabbath is as applicable to Christian believers as the other nine. Adventists have often taught a distinction between \"moral law\" and \"ceremonial law\". According to Adventist beliefs, the moral law continues into the \"New Testament era\", but the ceremonial law was done away with by Jesus.\n\nHow the [[Mosaic law]] should be applied came up at Adventist conferences in the past, and Adventist theologians such as [[A.

They were opposed by [[Uriah Smith]] and [[George Ide Butler|George Butler]] at the 1888 Conference.

The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], as well as events in [[Christianity in the 1st century|first-century Christianity]]. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as [[Religious text|sacred scripture]].\n\nThe New Testament is a collection of Christian texts originally written in the [[Koine Greek]] language, at different times by various different authors. While the Old Testament canon varies somewhat between different [[Christian denomination]]s, the [[Development of the New Testament canon|27-book canon]] of the New Testament has been almost universally recognized within [[Christianity]] since at least [[Late Antiquity]]. Thus, in almost all Christian traditions today, the New Testament consists of 27 books: \n* 4 [[Canonical Gospels]] ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]])\n*  1 [[Acts of the Apostles]]\n* 14 [[Pauline epistles|Epistles of Paul]]\n* 7 [[General Epistles]], and\n* 1 [[Book of Revelation]].\n\nThe earliest known complete list of the 27 books of the New Testament is found in a letter written by [[Athanasius]], a 4th-century [[bishop]] of [[Alexandria]], dated to 367 AD.<ref name=\"LindbergCarter\">{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Christianity |first=Carter |last=Lindberg |page=15|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=978-1-4051-1078-5}}</ref> The 27-book New Testament was first formally canonized during the councils of [[Council of Hippo|Hippo]] (393) and [[Council of Carthage|Carthage]] (397) in North Africa. [[Pope]] [[Innocent I]] ratified the same canon in 405, but it is probable that a Council in Rome in 382 under [[Pope Damasus I]] gave the same list first. These councils also provided the canon of the Old Testament, which included the [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]] books.<ref>Introduction to the New Testament. Werner Georg Kummel. Abingdon Press. Nashville. 1993.</ref>\n\nThere is no [[scholarly consensus]] on the date of composition of the latest New Testament texts. Conservative scholars [[John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich)#Redating the New Testament (1976)|John A. T. Robinson]], [[Daniel B. Wallace|Dan Wallace]], and [[William F. Albright]] dated all the books of the New Testament before 70 AD.<ref>{{cite book |first = John Arthur Thomas |last= Robinson |title= Redating the New Testament | year = 2000 | origyear=1976 |location= Eugene, Oregon |publisher=Wipf & Stock |isbn=978-1-57910-527-3 |page=352 }}</ref> But most{{Citation needed|date 2020-0421|date=April 2020}} scholars date some New Testament texts much later than this.

[[Lactantius]], a 3rd\u20134th century Christian author wrote in his early-4th-century Latin ''Institutiones Divinae'' (''Divine Institutes''):<ref>Lactantius. \"Chapter XX\".

The Jews make use of the Old, we of the New: but yet they are not discordant, for the New is the fulfilling of the Old, and in both there is the same testator, even Christ, who, having suffered death for us, made us heirs of His everlasting kingdom, the people of the Jews being deprived and disinherited. As the prophet Jeremiah testifies when he speaks such things: \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new testament to the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they continued not in my testament, and I disregarded them, saith the Lord.\"{{Bibleref2c|Jer|31:31\u201332}}  ...

The first author to explicitly name the canonical gospels is [[Irenaeus]] of Lyon,<ref name=\"trobisch-2012\"/><ref>[[Irenaeus]], ''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103311.htm Against Heresies]'' III.11</ref> who promoted the four canonical gospels in his book [[Against Heresies (Irenaeus)|Against Heresies]], written around 180.<ref>Due to its reference to [[Eleutherus]] as the current [[bishop of Rome]], the work is usually dated {{circa|lk=no|180}}.

Eerdmans Publishing Company]].</ref> Whatever these admittedly early ascriptions may imply about the sources behind or the perception of these gospels, they are anonymous compositions.\n* The [[Gospel of Matthew]], ascribed to the [[Matthew the Evangelist|Apostle Matthew]]. This gospel begins with a [[genealogy of Jesus]] and a story of his birth that includes a visit from [[Biblical Magi|magi]] and a [[flight into Egypt]], and it ends with the [[Great Commission|commissioning of the disciples]] by the resurrected Jesus.\n* The [[Gospel of Mark]], ascribed to [[Mark the Evangelist]]. This gospel begins with the preaching of [[John the Baptist]] and the [[baptism of Jesus]]. Two different secondary endings were affixed to this gospel in the 2nd century.\n* The [[Gospel of Luke]], ascribed to [[Luke the Evangelist]], who was not one of [[Twelve Disciples#The Twelve Apostles|the Twelve Apostles]], but was mentioned as a companion of the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]] and as a physician.<ref>Fitzmyer, Joseph A. (1985). ''The Gospel according to Luke, Vol. 1''. Anchor Bible Commentary series. New York: Doubleday. pp. 35\u201353.</ref> This gospel begins with parallel stories of the birth and childhood of [[John the Baptist]] and [[Jesus]] and ends with appearances of the resurrected Jesus and his ascension into heaven.\n* The [[Gospel of John]], ascribed to [[John the Evangelist]]. This gospel begins with a philosophical prologue and ends with appearances of the resurrected Jesus.\n\nThe first three gospels listed above are classified as the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. They contain similar accounts of the events in Jesus's life and his teaching, due to their literary interdependence. The Gospel of John is structured differently and includes stories of several miracles of Jesus and sayings not found in the other three.\n\nThese four gospels that were eventually included in the New Testament were only a few among many other early Christian gospels. The existence of such texts is even mentioned at the beginning of the Gospel of Luke.{{Bibleref2c|Luke|1:1\u20134}} Other early Christian gospels, such as the so-called \"[[Jewish-Christian Gospels]]\" or the [[Gospel of Thomas]], also offer both a window into the context of [[early Christianity]] and may provide some assistance in the reconstruction of the [[historical Jesus]].\n\n===Acts of the Apostles===\nThe [[Acts of the Apostles]] is a narrative of the apostles' ministry and activity after [[Christ's death]] and resurrection, from which point it resumes and functions as a sequel to the [[Gospel of Luke]]. Examining style, phraseology, and other evidence, modern scholarship generally concludes that Acts and the Gospel of Luke share the same author, referred to as [[Luke\u2013Acts]]. Luke-Acts does not name its author.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=196}} Church tradition identified him as [[Luke the Evangelist]], the companion of Paul, but the majority of scholars reject this due to the many differences between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|p=235}} The most probable date of composition is around 80\u2013100 AD, although some scholars date it significantly later,<ref name=\"pervo\"/><ref name=\"trobisch-2007\"/> and there is evidence that it was still being substantially revised well into the 2nd century.{{sfn|Perkins|2009|pp=250\u201353}}\n\n===Epistles===\nThe epistles of the New Testament are considered by Christians to be divinely inspired and holy letters, written by the apostles and disciples of Christ, to either local congregations with specific needs, or to [[New Covenant]] Christians in general, scattered about; or \"catholic epistles.\"\n\n====Pauline letters to churches====\n{{Main|Pauline epistles}}\nThe Pauline letters to churches are the thirteen New Testament books that present [[Paul the Apostle]] as their author.{{refn|group=note|[[Joseph Barber Lightfoot]] in his ''Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians'' writes: \"At this point [{{Bibleref2|Gal|6:11}}] the apostle takes the pen from his [[amanuensis]], and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. From the time when letters began to be forged in his name ({{bibleref2|2 Thess|2:2||2 Thess. 3:17}}; {{bibleref2-nb|2 Thess|3:17||2 Thess. 3:17}}) it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such forgeries.... In the present case he writes a whole paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed sentences. He writes it, too, in large, bold characters (Gr. ''pelikois grammasin''), that his handwriting may reflect the energy and determination of his soul.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Lightfoot |first=Joseph Barber |year=1866 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8ECAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA217 |title=St Paul's Epistle to the Galatians |edition=2nd |publisher=MacMillan & Co |page=217}}</ref>}} Six of the letters are disputed. Four are thought by most modern scholars to be [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]], i.e., not actually written by Paul even if attributed to him within the letters themselves.  Opinion is more divided on the other two disputed letters (2 Thessalonians and Colossians).<ref>[[Jouette Bassler|Bassler, Jouette M.]] (2010). \"Paul and his Letters\". In Aune, David E.

They include the following:\n* [[First Epistle to Timothy]]<sup>*</sup>\n* [[Second Epistle to Timothy]]<sup>*</sup>\n* [[Epistle to Titus]]<sup>*</sup>\n* [[Epistle to Philemon]]\n[Disputed letters are marked with an asterisk (*).]\n\nAll of the above except for Philemon are known as the [[Pastoral epistles]]. They are addressed to individuals charged with pastoral oversight of churches and discuss issues of Christian living, doctrine and leadership. They often address different concerns to those of the preceding epistles. These letters are believed by many to be pseudepigraphic. Some scholars (e.g., Bill Mounce, Ben Witherington) will argue that the letters are genuinely Pauline, or at least written under Paul's supervision.\n\n====Hebrews====\nThe [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] addresses a Jewish audience who had come to believe that Jesus was the [[Messiah#Judaism|anointed one]] (Hebrew: \u05de\u05b8\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05d7\u05b7\u2014transliterated in English as \"Moshiach\", or \"Messiah\"; Greek: \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2\u2014transliterated in English as \"Christos\", for \"[[Christ]]\") who was predicted in the writings of the Hebrew Scriptures. The author discusses the superiority of the new covenant and the ministry of Jesus, to the [[Mosaic covenant]] {{Bibleref2c|Heb.|1:1\u201310:18}} and urges the readers in the practical implications of this conviction through the end of the epistle.{{Bibleref2c|Heb.|10:19\u201313:25}}\n\nThe book has been widely accepted by the Christian church as inspired by God and thus authoritative, despite the acknowledgment of uncertainties about who its human author was. Regarding authorship, although the Epistle to the Hebrews does not internally claim to have been written by the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]], some similarities in wordings to some of the Pauline Epistles have been noted and inferred. In antiquity, some began to ascribe it to Paul in an attempt to provide the anonymous work an explicit apostolic pedigree.<ref>[[Harold W. Attridge|Attridge, Harold W.]] (1989). ''Hebrews''. Hermeneia. Philadelphia: Fortress. pp. 1\u20136.</ref>\n\nIn the 4th century, [[Jerome]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] supported [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles|Paul's authorship]]. The Church largely agreed to include Hebrews as the fourteenth letter of Paul, and affirmed this authorship until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. The letter to the Hebrews had difficulty in being accepted as part of the Christian canon because of its anonymity.<ref>[[William L. Lane|Lane, William L.]] (1991). ''Hebrews 1\u20138''.

(2004). ''The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings''. Oxford University Press. p. 323. \"Scholars in the ancient world went about detecting forgeries in much the same way that modern scholars do. They looked to see whether the ideas and writing style of a piece conformed with those used by the author in other writings, and they examined the text for any blatant anachronisms, that is, statements about things that could not have existed at the time the alleged author was writing (like the letter reputedly from an early seventeenth-century American colonist that mentions \"the United States\")- Arguments of this kind were used by some Christian scholars of the third century to show that Hebrews was not written by Paul or the Book of Revelation by John the son of Zebedee. Modern scholars, as we will see, concur with these judgments. To be sure, neither of these books can be considered a forgery. Hebrews does not claim to be written by Paul (it is anonymous), and the John who wrote Revelation does not claim to be the son of Zebedee (it is therefore homonymous). Are there other books in the New Testament, though, that can be considered forgeries?\"</ref> based on its distinctive style and theology, which are considered to set it apart from Paul's writings.<ref name=Powell>{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Mark A. |year=2009 |title=Introducing the New Testament: A Historical, Literary, and Theological Survey |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |publisher=Baker Academic |pages=[https://archive.org/details/introducingnewte00powe/page/431 431\u201332] |isbn=978-0-8010-2868-7 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/introducingnewte00powe/page/431 }}</ref>\n\n====Catholic epistles====\nThe [[Catholic epistles]] (or \"general epistles\") consist of both letters and treatises in the form of letters written to the church at large.

In the New Testament canon, it is considered [[Bible prophecy|prophetical]] or [[apocalyptic literature]]. Its authorship has been attributed either to John the Apostle (in which case it is often thought that John the Apostle is [[John the Evangelist]], i.e. author of the [[Gospel of John]]) or to another John designated \"[[John of Patmos]]\" after the island where the text says the revelation was received (1:9).

In the Latin West, prior to the [[Vulgate]] (an early 5th-century Latin version of the Bible), the four Gospels were arranged in the following order: Matthew, John, Luke, and Mark.{{refn|group=note|The Gospels are in this order in many Old Latin manuscripts, as well as in the Greek manuscripts [[Codex Bezae]] and [[Codex Washingtonianus]].}} The Syriac [[Peshitta]] places the major Catholic epistles (James, 1 Peter, and 1 John) immediately after Acts and before the Pauline epistles.\n\nThe order of an early edition of the letters of Paul is based on the size of the letters: longest to shortest, though keeping 1 and 2 Corinthians and 1 and 2 Thessalonians together. The Pastoral epistles were apparently not part of the ''Corpus Paulinum'' in which this order originated and were later inserted after 2 Thessalonians and before Philemon. Hebrews was variously incorporated into the ''Corpus Paulinum'' either after 2 Thessalonians, after Philemon (i.e. at the very end), or after Romans.\n\nThe New Testament of the 16th-century [[Luther Bible]] continues, to this day, to place Hebrews, James, Jude, and the Apocalypse last. This reflects the thoughts of the Reformer Martin Luther [[Luther's canon|on the canonicity of these books]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/links10.html|title=Web Directory: German Bible Versions|publisher=Bible Research|accessdate=17 February 2016}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|See also the article on the [[Antilegomena]].}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Apocrypha==\n{{Main|New Testament apocrypha}}\nThe books that eventually found a permanent place in the New Testament were not the only works of Christian literature produced in the earliest Christian centuries. The long process of [[Development of the New Testament canon|canonization]] began early, sometimes with tacit reception of traditional texts, sometimes with explicit selection or rejection of particular texts as either acceptable or unacceptable for use in a given context (e.g., not all texts that were acceptable for private use were considered appropriate for use in the [[liturgy]]).\n\nOver the course of history, those works of early Christian literature that survived but that did not become part of the New Testament have been variously grouped by theologians and scholars. Drawing upon, though redefining, an older term used in [[early Christianity]] and among Protestants when referring to those books found in the Christian [[Old Testament]] although not in the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]], modern scholars began to refer to these works of early Christian literature not included in the New Testament as \"apocryphal\", by which was meant non-canonical.\n\nCollected editions of these works were then referred to as the \"[[New Testament apocrypha]]\". Typically excluded from such published collections are the following groups of works: [[Apostolic Fathers|The Apostolic Fathers]], the 2nd-century Christian apologists, [[Alexandrian school|the Alexandrians]], [[Tertullian]], [[Methodius of Olympus]], [[Novatian]], [[Cyprian]], martyrdoms, and [[Desert Fathers|the Desert Fathers]]. Almost all other Christian literature from the period, and sometimes including works composed well into [[Late Antiquity]], are relegated to the so-called New Testament apocrypha.\n\nAlthough not considered to be inspired by God, these \"apocryphal\" works were produced in the same ancient context and often using the same language as those books that would eventually form the New Testament. Some of these later works are dependent (either directly or indirectly) upon books that would later come to be in the New Testament or upon the ideas expressed in them. There is even an example of a [[pseudepigraph]]ical letter composed under the guise of a presumably lost letter of the Apostle Paul, the [[Epistle to the Laodiceans]].\n\n==Authors==\n{{Main|Authorship of the Bible}}\nThe books of the New Testament were all or nearly all written by [[Jewish Christians]]\u2014that is, Jewish disciples of Christ, who lived in the [[Roman Empire]], and under [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman occupation]].<ref>{{harvp|Powell|2009|p=16}}</ref> Luke, who wrote the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts, is frequently thought of as an exception; scholars are divided as to whether Luke was a Gentile or a [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic Jew]].<ref name=\"Strelan2013\">Strelan, Rick (2013).

All of these letters easily fit into the chronology of Paul's journeys depicted in Acts of the Apostles.\n\n===Other epistles===\nThe author of the [[Epistle of James]] identifies himself in the opening verse as \"James, a servant of [[God]] and of the Lord [[Jesus]] Christ\". From the middle of the 3rd century, [[patristic]] authors cited the ''Epistle'' as written by [[James the Just]].<ref>[http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/j/james,epistle_of_st.html \"Epistle of St. James\"].

The author has traditionally been identified with [[John the Apostle]] to whom the [[Gospel of John|Gospel]] and the [[epistles of John]] were attributed. It was believed that he was exiled to the island of Patmos during the reign of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Domitian]], and there wrote Revelation. [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 100\u2013165 AD) who was acquainted with [[Polycarp]], who had been mentored by John, makes a possible allusion to this book, and credits John as the source.<ref>Justin Martyr.

Explicit references to NT books in extra-biblical documents can push this upper limit down a bit further. [[Irenaeus]] of Lyon names and quotes from most of the books in the New Testament in his book [[Against Heresies (Irenaeus)|''Against Heresies'']], written around 180 AD. The [[Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians]], written some time between 110 and [[Polycarp|Polycarp's death]] in 155-167 AD, quotes or alludes to most New Testament texts. [[Ignatius of Antioch]] wrote letters referencing much of the New Testament. He lived from about 35AD to 107AD and is rumored to have been a disciple of the Apostle John. His writings reference the Gospels of John, Matthew, and Luke, as well as Peter, James, and Paul\u2019s Episltes. His writing is usually attributed to the end of his lifetime, which places the Gospels as First Century writings.\n\n===Internal evidence===\nLiterary analysis of the New Testament texts themselves can be used to date many of the books of the New Testament to the mid- to late first century. The earliest works of the New Testament are the letters of the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]]. It can be determined that [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|1 Thessalonians]] is likely the earliest of these letters, written around 52 AD.<ref name=\"Brown\">[[Raymond E.

The information used to create the late-4th-century [[Easter Letter]], which declared accepted Christian writings, was probably based on the ''Ecclesiastical History'' [HE] of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], wherein he uses the information passed on to him by Origen to create both his list at HE 3:25 and Origen's list at HE 6:25. Eusebius got his information about what texts were then accepted and what were then [[Antilegomena|disputed]], by the [[Early centers of Christianity|third-century churches throughout the known world]], a great deal of which Origen knew of firsthand from his extensive travels, from the library and writings of Origen.<ref>Bateman, C.

First then must be put the holy quaternion of the gospels; following them the Acts of the Apostles... the epistles of Paul... the epistle of John... the epistle of Peter... After them is to be placed, if it really seem proper, the Book of Revelation, concerning which we shall give the different opinions at the proper time. These then belong among the accepted writings.\"\n\n: \"3 Among the disputed writings, which are nevertheless recognized by many, are extant the so-called epistle of James and that of Jude, also the second epistle of Peter, and those that are called the second and third of John, whether they belong to the evangelist or to another person of the same name. Among the rejected [Kirsopp Lake translation: \"not genuine\"] writings must be reckoned also the [[Acts of Paul]], and the so-called [[Shepherd of Hermas|Shepherd]], and the [[Apocalypse of Peter]], and in addition to these the extant [[epistle of Barnabas]], and the so-called [[Didache|Teachings of the Apostles]]; and besides, as I said, the [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse of John]], if it seem proper, which some, as I said, reject, but which others class with the accepted books.

Wherefore they are not to be placed even among the rejected writings, but are all of them to be cast aside as absurd and impious.\"\n\nThe Book of Revelation is counted as both accepted (Kirsopp Lake translation: \"Recognized\") and disputed, which has caused some confusion over what exactly Eusebius meant by doing so. From other writings of the church fathers, it was disputed with several canon lists rejecting its canonicity. EH 3.3.5 adds further detail on Paul: \"Paul's fourteen epistles are well known and undisputed. It is not indeed right to overlook the fact that some have rejected the Epistle to the Hebrews, saying that it is disputed by the church of Rome, on the ground that it was not written by Paul.\" EH 4.29.6 mentions the [[Diatessaron]]: \"But their original founder, Tatian, formed a certain combination and collection of the gospels, I know not how, to which he gave the title Diatessaron, and which is still in the hands of some. But they say that he ventured to paraphrase certain words of the apostle Paul, in order to improve their style.\"\n\n===4th century and later===\nIn his Easter letter of 367, [[Athanasius]], Bishop of Alexandria, gave a list of the books that would become the twenty-seven-book NT canon,<ref name=\"LindbergCarter\"/> and he used the word \"canonized\" (''kanonizomena'') in regards to them.<ref>Brakke, David (Oct 1994). \"Canon Formation and Social Conflict in Fourth Century Egypt: Athanasius of Alexandria's Thirty Ninth Festal Letter\".

Certain books, referred to as [[Antilegomena]], continued to be questioned, especially [[Epistle of James|James]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]. Even as late as the 16th century, the Reformer [[Martin Luther]] questioned (but in the end did not reject) the [[Epistle of James]], the [[Epistle of Jude]], the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] and the [[Book of Revelation]]. To this day, German-language [[Luther Bible]]s are printed with these four books at the end of the canon, rather than in their traditional order as in other editions of the Bible.\n\nIn light of this questioning of the canon of Scripture by Protestants in the 16th century, the (Roman Catholic) [[Council of Trent]] reaffirmed the traditional western canon (i.e., the canon accepted at the 4th-century [[Council of Rome]] and [[Council of Carthage]]), thus making the [[Canon of Trent]] and the [[Vulgate]] Bible [[Roman Catholic Dogma|dogma]] in the Catholic Church. Later, [[Pope Pius XI]] on 2 June 1927 decreed the [[Comma Johanneum]] was open to dispute and [[Pope Pius XII]] on 3 September 1943 issued the encyclical ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'', which allowed translations based on other versions than just the Latin [[Vulgate]], notably in English the [[New American Bible]].\n\nThus, some claim that, from the [[Christianity in the 4th century#Defining scripture|4th century]], there existed unanimity in the [[Western Church|West]] concerning the New Testament canon (as it is today),<ref>{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=215}}</ref> and that, by the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]], the [[Eastern Church]], with a few exceptions, had come to accept the [[Book of Revelation]] and thus had come into harmony on the matter of the canon.<ref name=\"P.

The Canon of the New Testament, like that of the Old, is the result of a development, of a process at once stimulated by disputes with doubters, both within and without the Church, and retarded by certain obscurities and natural hesitations, and which did not reach its final term until the dogmatic definition of the [[Council of Trent|Tridentine Council]].\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Reid |first=George |year=1908 |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03274a.htm |chapter=Canon of the New Testament |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company}}</ref>\n\nIn 331, [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine I]] commissioned Eusebius to deliver [[Fifty Bibles of Constantine|fifty Bibles]] for the [[Church of Constantinople]].

Some of these fragments have even been thought to date as early as the 2nd century (i.e., [[Papyrus 90]], [[Papyrus 98]], [[Papyrus 104]], and famously [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], though the early date of the latter has recently been called into question).<ref>For the initial dating of P52, see Roberts, C.

The date when a manuscript was written, however, does not necessarily reflect the date of the form of text it contains.

These are called [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]]. In modern translations of the Bible, the results of textual criticism have led to certain verses, words and phrases being left out or marked as not original. According to [[Bart D.

Bible Commentaries also discuss these, sometimes in great detail. While many variations have been discovered between early copies of biblical texts, almost all have no importance, as they are variations in spelling, punctuation, or grammar. Also, many of these variants are so particular to the Greek language that they would not appear in translations into other languages. For example, order of words (i.e. \"man bites dog\" versus \"dog bites man\") often does not matter in Greek, so textual variants that flip the order of words often have no consequences.<ref name=\"Strobel, Lee 1998\"/>\n\nOutside of these unimportant variants, there are a couple variants of some importance.

Vol. 4. pp. 594\u2013595.{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}</ref> Most of the variation took place within the first three Christian centuries.\n\n===Text-types===\nBy the 4th century, textual \"families\" or types of text become discernible among [[biblical manuscript|New Testament manuscripts]]. A \"text-type\" is the name given to a family of texts with similar readings due to common ancestors and mutual correction. Many early manuscripts, however, contain individual readings from several different earlier forms of text. Modern texual critics have identified the following text-types among textual witnesses to the New Testament: The [[Alexandrian text-type]] is usually considered to generally preserve many early readings. It is represented, e.g., by [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]], [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and the [[Bodmer Papyri]].\n\nThe [[Western text-type]] is generally longer and can be paraphrastic, but can also preserve early readings. The [[Acts of the Apostles#Manuscripts|Western version of the Acts of the Apostles]] is, notably, 8.5% longer than the Alexandrian form of the text. Examples of the Western text are found in [[Codex Bezae]], [[Codex Claromontanus]], [[Codex Washingtonianus]], the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] (i.e., Latin translations made prior to the [[Vulgate]]), as well as in quotations by [[Marcion]], [[Tatian]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Cyprian]].\n\nA text-type referred to as the \"[[Caesarean text-type]]\" and thought to have included witnesses such as [[Codex Koridethi]] and minuscule 565, can today be described neither as \"Caesarean\" nor as a text-type as was previously thought. However, the Gospel of Mark in [[Papyrus 45]], [[Codex Washingtonianus]] and in [[Family 13]] does indeed reflect a distinct type of text.\n\nIncreasing standardization of distinct (and once local) text-types eventually gave rise to the [[Byzantine text-type]]. Since most manuscripts of the New Testament do not derive from the first several centuries, that is, they were copied after the rise of the Byzantine text-type, this form of text is found the majority of extant manuscripts and is therefore often called the \"Majority Text.\" As with all of the other (earlier) text-types, the Byzantine can also occasionally preserve early readings.\n\n===Biblical criticism===\n{{Main|Biblical criticism}}\n[[Biblical criticism]] is the scholarly \"study and investigation of [[Biblical manuscript|biblical writings]] that seeks to make discerning judgments about these writings.\" Viewing biblical texts as having human rather than supernatural origins, it asks when and where a particular text originated; how, why, by whom, for whom, and in what circumstances it was produced; what influences were at work in its production; what sources were used in its composition; and what message it was intended to convey.\n\nIt will vary slightly depending on whether the focus is on the [[Old Testament]], the letters of the New Testament, or the [[Canonical Gospels]]. It also plays an important role in the quest for the [[historical Jesus]]. It also addresses the physical text, including the meaning of the words and the way in which they are used, its preservation, history, and integrity. Biblical criticism draws upon a wide range of scholarly disciplines including [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[folklore]], [[linguistics]], [[Christian Oral Tradition|Oral Tradition studies]], history, and [[religious studies]].\n\n===Establishing a critical text===\n{{Main|New Testament manuscripts}}\nThe [[#Textual variation|textual variation]] among manuscript copies of books in the New Testament prompted attempts to discern the earliest form of text already in antiquity (e.g., by the 3rd-century Christian author [[Origen]]). The efforts began in earnest again during the [[Renaissance]], which saw a revival of the study of ancient Greek texts. During this period, modern [[textual criticism]] was born. In this context, [[Christian humanism|Christian humanists]] such as [[Lorenzo Valla]] and [[Erasmus]] promoted a return to the original Greek of the New Testament. This was the beginning of modern [[New Testament textual criticism]], which over subsequent centuries would increasingly incorporate more and more manuscripts, in more languages (i.e., versions of the New Testament), as well as citations of the New Testament by ancient authors and the New Testament text in [[lectionary|lectionaries]] in order to reconstruct the earliest recoverable form of the New Testament text and the history of changes to it.<ref>[[Bruce M. Metzger|Metzger, Bruce M.]]; [[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]] (2005). ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration''. 4th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\n==Relationship to earlier and contemporaneous literature==\n{{Further|Non-canonical books referenced in the Bible}}\nBooks that later formed the New Testament, like other Christian literature of the period, originated in a literary context that reveals relationships not only to other Christian writings, but also to [[Classics|Graeco-Roman]] and [[Judaism#Antiquity|Jewish]] works. Of singular importance is the extensive use of and interaction with the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]] and what would become the [[Old Testament|Christian Old Testament]]. Both implicit and explicit citations, as well as countless allusions, appear throughout the books of the New Testament, from the Gospels and Acts, to the Epistles, to the Apocalypse.<ref>See, e.g., Stendahl, Krister (1954).

London: SCM.</ref>\n\n==Early versions==\nThe first translations (usually called \"versions\") of the New Testament were made beginning already at the end of 2nd century. The earliest versions of the New Testament are the translations into the [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Latin]], and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] languages.<ref>[[Arthur V\u00f5\u00f5bus|V\u00f5\u00f5bus, Arthur]] (1954). ''Early Versions of the New Testament''. Stockholm. pp. 1\u2013128, 211\u2013240.</ref> These three versions were made directly from the Greek, and are frequently cited in the apparatuses of modern critical editions.\n\n===Syriac===\n{{Main|Syriac versions of the Bible}}\n[[File:RabulaGospelsFolio04vCanonTable.jpg|thumb|The [[Rabbula Gospels]], [[Eusebian Canons]].]]\nSyriac was spoken in [[Syria]], and [[Mesopotamia]], and with dialect in [[Syria Palaestina|Roman]] and [[Palaestina Secunda|Byzantine Palestine]] where it was known as [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]]. Several Syriac translations were made and have come to us. Most of the Old Syriac, however, as well as the Philoxonian version have been lost.\n\n[[Tatian]], the Assyrian, created the [[Diatessaron]], a [[gospel harmony]] written in Syriac around 170 AD and the earliest form of the gospel not only in Syriac but probably also in Armenian.\n\nIn the 19th century, manuscript evidence was discovered for an \"Old Syriac\" version of the four distinct (i.e., not harmonized) gospels. These \"separated\" (Syriac: ''da-Mepharreshe'') gospels, though old, have been shown to be later than the Diatessaron. The Old Syriac gospels are fragmentarily preserved in two manuscripts: the 5th-century [[Curetonian Gospels|Curetonian Syriac]] and the [[Syriac Sinaiticus|Sinaitic Syriac]] from the 4th or 5th century.\n\nNo Old Syriac manuscripts of other portions of the New Testament survive, though Old Syriac readings, e.g. from the [[Pauline Epistles]], can be discerned in citations made by Eastern fathers and in later Syriac versions. The Old Syriac version is a representative of the [[Western text-type]]. The [[Peshitta]] version was prepared in the beginning of the 5th century. It contains only 22 books (neither the [[General epistles|Minor Catholic Epistles]] of 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, and Jude, nor the [[Book of Revelation]] were part of this translation).\n\nThe [[Philoxenian]] probably was produced in 508 for [[Philoxenus, Bishop of Mabung]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Metzger |first=Bruce M. |authorlink=Bruce M. Metzger |year=1977 |title=The Early Versions of the New Testament |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |pages=3\u201398 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Latin===\n{{Main|Vetus Latina|Vulgate}}\nThe Gospels were likely translated into Latin as early as the last quarter of the 2nd century in North Africa (''Afra''). Not much later, there were also European Latin translations (''Itala''). There are about 80 Old Latin mansucripts. The [[Vetus Latina]] (\"Old Latin\") versions often contain readings with a Western type of text. (For the avoidance of confusion, these texts were written in [[Late Latin]], not the early version of the Latin language known as [[Old Latin]], pre 75 BC.)\n\nThe bewildering diversity of the Old Latin versions prompted [[Jerome]] to prepare another translation into Latin\u2014the [[Vulgate]]. In many respects it was merely a revision of the Old Latin. There are currently around 8,000 manuscripts of the Vulgate.\n\n===Coptic===\n{{Main|Coptic versions of the Bible}}\nThere are several dialects of the Coptic language: [[Bohairic]] (northern dialect), [[Fayyumic]], [[Sahidic]] (southern dialect), [[Akhmimic]], and others. The first translation was made by at least the 3rd century into the Sahidic dialect (cop<sup>sa</sup>). This translation represents a mixed text, mostly [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]], though also with [[Western text-type|Western]] readings.<ref>{{cite book |last=V\u00f6\u00f6bus |first=Arthur |year=1954 |title=Early Versions of the New Testament |location=Stockholm |pages=216\u2013229 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nA Bohairic translation was made later, but existed already in the 4th century. Though the translation makes less use of Greek words than the Sahidic, it does employ some Greek grammar (e.g., in word-order and the use of particles such as the syntactic construction \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u2014\u03b4\u03b5). For this reason, the Bohairic translation can be helpful in the reconstruction of the early Greek text of the New Testament.<ref>{{harvp|V\u00f6\u00f6bus|1954|pp=229\u2013237}}; {{harvp|Metzger|1977|pp=99\u2013152}}</ref>\n\n===Other ancient translations===\n[[File:Matthew's Gospel - British Library Add. MS 59874 Ethiopian Bible.jpg|thumb|BL Add. MS 59874 with [[Ethiopic]] [[Gospel of Matthew]].]]\nThe continued spread of Christianity, and the foundation of national churches, led to the translation of the Bible\u2014often beginning with books from the New Testament\u2014into a variety of other languages at a relatively early date: [[Bible translations into Armenian|Armenian]], [[Bible translations into Georgian|Georgian]], [[Ethiopic]], [[Bible translations into Persian|Persian]], [[Bible translations into Sogdian|Sogdian]], and eventually [[Gothic Bible|Gothic]], [[Bible translations into Church Slavonic|Old Church Slavonic]], [[Bible translations into Arabic|Arabic]], and [[Bible translations into Nubian|Nubian]].<ref>On the Armenian, Georgian, Ethiopic, Arabic, and Gothic, see {{harvp|V\u00f6\u00f6bus|1954|loc=pp. 133\u2013210, 243\u2013309}}</ref>\n\n==Modern translations==\n{{Main|Bible translations}}\n\nHistorically, throughout the [[Christendom|Christian world]] and in the context of [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missionary activity]], the New Testament (or portions thereof) has been that part of the Christian Bible first translated into the [[vernacular]]. The production of such translations grew out of the insertion of [[vernacular]] [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] in biblical texts, as well as out of the production of [[biblical paraphrase]]s and poetic renditions of stories from the life of Christ (e.g., the [[Heliand]]).\n\nThe 16th century saw the rise of [[Protestantism]] and an explosion of translations of the New (and Old) Testament into the [[vernacular]]. Notable are those of [[Luther Bible|Martin Luther]] (1522), [[Jacques Lef\u00e8vre d'\u00c9taples]] (1523), the [[Z\u00fcrich Bible|Froschau Bible]] (1525\u20131529, revised in 1574), [[Tyndale Bible|William Tyndale]] (1526, revised in 1534, 1535 and 1536), the [[Brest Bible]] (1563), and the [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized Version]] (also called the \"King James Version\") (1611).\n\nMost of these translations relied (though not always exclusively) upon one of the printed editions of the Greek New Testament edited by [[Erasmus]], a form of this Greek text emerged as the standard and is known as the [[Textus Receptus]]. This text, based on the majority of manuscripts is also used in the majority of translations that were made in the years 100 to 400 AD.\n\nTranslations of the New Testament made since the appearance of critical editions of the Greek text (notably those of [[Constantin von Tischendorf|Tischendorf]], [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]], and [[Von Soden catalogue|von Soden]]) have largely used them as their [[Source text|base text]]. Unlike the [[Textus Receptus]], these have a pronounced Alexandrian character. Standard critical editions are those of [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-\u00c5land]] (the text, though not the full critical apparatus of which is reproduced in the [[United Bible Societies]]' \"Greek New Testament\"), [[Alexander Souter|Souter]], Vogels, Bover and Merk.\n\nNotable translations of the New Testament based on these most recent critical editions include the [[Revised Standard Version]] (1946, revised in 1971), [[:fr:La Bible de J\u00e9rusalem|La Bible de J\u00e9rusalem]] (1961, revised in 1973 and 2000), the [[Einheits\u00fcbersetzung]] (1970, final edition 1979), the [[New American Bible]] (1970, revised in 1986), the [[Traduction Oecum\u00e9nique de la Bible]] (1988, revised in 2004), and the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (1989).\n\n==Theological interpretation in Christian churches==\n{{Main|Biblical authority}}\nThough all Christian churches accept the New Testament as scripture, they differ in their understanding of the nature, extent, and relevance of its authority. Views of the authoritativeness of the New Testament often depend on the concept of ''[[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]]'', which relates to the role of God in the formation of the New Testament. Generally, the greater the role of God in one's doctrine of inspiration, the more one accepts the [[doctrine]] of [[biblical inerrancy]] or authoritativeness of the Bible. One possible source of confusion is that these terms are difficult to define, because many people use them interchangeably or with very different meanings. This article will use the terms in the following manner:\n*''Infallibility'' relates to the absolute correctness of the Bible in matters of doctrine.\n*''Inerrancy'' relates to the absolute correctness of the Bible in factual assertions (including historical and scientific assertions).\n*''Authoritativeness'' relates to the correctness of the Bible in questions of practice in morality.\n\n{{Quotation|The self-witness of the Bible to its inspiration demands a commitment to its unity. The ultimate basis for unity is contained in the claim of divine inspiration in {{Bibleref2|2tim|3:16||2&nbsp;Timothy 3:16}} that \"all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness\" (KJV). The term \"inspiration\" renders the Greek word ''theopneustos''. This term only occurs here in the New Testament and literally means \"God-breathed\" (the chosen translation of the NIV).<ref name=Elwell>Meadors, Gary T. (1997). [http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/bakers-evangelical-dictionary/scripture-unity-and-diversity-of.html \"Scripture, Unity and Diversity of\"]. In Elwell, Walter A. (ed.). ''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology.'' Grand Rapids: Baker Books.</ref>  }}\n\nAll of these concepts depend for their meaning on the supposition that the text of Bible has been properly interpreted, with consideration for the intention of the text, whether [[literal and figurative language|literal]] history, [[allegory]] or poetry, etc. Especially the doctrine of inerrancy is variously understood according to the weight given by the interpreter to scientific investigations of the world.\n\n===Unity in diversity===\nThe notion of unity in diversity of Scripture claims that the Bible presents a noncontradictory and consistent message concerning God and redemptive history. The fact of diversity is observed in comparing the diversity of time, culture, authors' perspectives, literary genre, and the theological themes.<ref name=Elwell/>\n\nStudies from many theologians considering the \"unity in diversity\" to be found in the New Testament (and the Bible as a whole) have been collected and summarized by New Testament theologian [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]]. He describes them as some basic presuppositions, tenets, and concerns common among the New Testament writers, giving to the New Testament its \"unity in diversity\":\n#The reality of God is never argued but is always assumed and affirmed\n#Jesus Christ is absolutely central: he is Lord and Savior, the foretold Prophet, the Messianic King, the Chosen, the way, the truth, and the light, the One through whom God the Father not only acted but through whom He came\n#The Holy Spirit came anew with Jesus Christ.\n#The Christian faith and life are a calling, rooted in divine election.\n#The plight of everyone as sinner means that each person is completely dependent upon the mercy and grace of God\n#Salvation is both God's gift and his demand through Jesus Christ, to be received by faith\n#The death and resurrection of Jesus are at the heart of the total event of which he was the center\n#God creates a people of his own, designated and described by varied terminology and analogies\n#History must be understood eschatologically, being brought along toward its ultimate goal when the kingdom of God, already present in Christ, is brought to its complete triumph\n#In Christ, all of God's work of creation, revelation, and redemption is brought to fulfillment<ref name=Stagg>Stagg, Frank (1962). ''New Testament Theology''. Broadman. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}.</ref>\n\n===Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Classical Anglicanism===\nFor the [[Roman Catholic Church]], there are two modes of Revelation: Scripture and [[Apostolic Tradition|Tradition]]. Both of them are interpreted by the teachings of the Church. The Roman Catholic view is expressed clearly in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] (1997):\n<blockquote>\n\u00a7 82: As a result the Church, to whom the transmission and interpretation of Revelation is entrusted, does not derive her certainty about all revealed truths from the holy Scriptures alone. Both Scripture and Tradition must be accepted and honoured with equal sentiments of devotion and reverence.\n<br />\n\u00a7 107: The inspired books teach the truth. Since therefore all that the inspired authors or sacred writers affirm should be regarded as affirmed by the Holy Spirit, we must acknowledge that the books of Scripture firmly, faithfully, and without error teach that truth which God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to see confided to the Sacred Scriptures.\n</blockquote>In Catholic terminology the teaching office is called the [[Magisterium]].  The Catholic view should not be confused with the two-source theory.  As the Catechism states in \u00a7\u00a7 80 and 81, Revelation has \"one common source ... two distinct modes of transmission.\"<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c2a2.htm \"The Transmission of Divine Revelation\"]. ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''. 2nd ed. 1997.</ref>\n\nWhile many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] writers distinguish between Scripture and Tradition, Bishop Kallistos Ware says that for the Orthodox there is only one source of the Christian faith, Holy Tradition, within which Scripture exists.<ref>Ware, Kallistos (1993). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2Z8bVDVMLEC&pg=PT243 \"Holy Tradition: The Source of the Orthodox Faith\"].''The Orthodox Church''. Penguin UK.</ref>\n\nTraditional [[Anglican Communion|Anglicans]] believe that \"Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation\", (Article VI), but also that the Catholic Creeds \"ought thoroughly to be received and believed\" (Article VIII), and that the Church \"hath authority in Controversies of Faith\" and is \"a witness and keeper of Holy Writ\" (Article XX).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html |title=Articles of Religion |publisher=Anglicans Online |accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref> Classical Anglicanism, therefore, like Orthodoxy, holds that Holy Tradition is the only safe guardian against perversion and innovation in the interpretation of Scripture.\n\nIn the famous words of Thomas Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells: \"As for my religion, I dye in the holy catholic and apostolic faith professed by the whole Church before the disunion of East and West, more particularly in the communion of the Church of England, as it stands distinguished from all Papal and Puritan innovations, and as it adheres to the doctrine of the Cross.\"\n\n===Protestantism===\nFollowing the doctrine of [[sola scriptura]], Protestants believe that their traditions of faith, practice and interpretations carry forward what the scriptures teach, and so tradition is not a source of authority in itself. Their traditions derive authority from the Bible, and are therefore always open to reevaluation. This openness to doctrinal revision has extended in [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal]] Protestant traditions even to the reevaluation of the doctrine of Scripture upon which the Reformation was founded, and members of these traditions may even question whether the Bible is infallible in doctrine, inerrant in historical and other factual statements, and whether it has uniquely divine authority. However, the adjustments made by modern [[Protestantism|Protestants]] to their doctrine of scripture vary widely.\n\n====American evangelical and fundamentalist Protestantism====\nWithin the US, the [[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]] (1978) is a statement, articulating evangelical views on this issue. Paragraph four of its summary states: \"Being wholly and verbally God-given, Scripture is without error or fault in all its teaching, no less in what it states about God's acts in creation, about the events of world history, and about its own literary origins under God, than in its witness to God's saving grace in individual lives.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/documents/index.html?mainframe=http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html |title=The Chicago Statement of Biblical Inerrancy |publisher=Center for Reformed Theology and Apologetics |accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n====American mainline and liberal Protestantism====\n[[Mainline (Protestant)|Mainline]] American [[Protestant]] denominations, including the [[United Methodist Church]], [[Presbyterian Church USA]], [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|The Episcopal Church]], and [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], do not teach the doctrine of inerrancy as set forth in the Chicago Statement. All of these churches have more ancient doctrinal statements asserting the authority of scripture, but may interpret these statements in such a way as to allow for a very broad range of teaching\u2014from evangelicalism to skepticism. It is not an impediment to ordination in these denominations to teach that the scriptures contain errors, or that the authors follow a more or less unenlightened ethics that, however appropriate it may have seemed in the authors' time, moderns would be very wrong to follow blindly.\n\nFor example, [[ordination of women]] is universally accepted in the mainline churches, [[abortion]] is condemned as a grievous social tragedy but not always a personal [[sin]] or a crime against an unborn person, and [[homosexuality]] is sometimes recognized as a genetic propensity or morally neutral preference that should be neither encouraged nor condemned. In North America, the most contentious of these issues among these churches at the present time is how far the ordination of gay men and lesbians should be accepted.\n\nOfficials of the Presbyterian Church USA report: \"We acknowledge the role of scriptural authority in the Presbyterian Church, but Presbyterians generally do not believe in biblical inerrancy. Presbyterians do not insist that every detail of chronology or sequence or prescientific description in scripture be true in literal form. Our confessions do teach biblical infallibility. Infallibility affirms the entire truthfulness of scripture without depending on every exact detail.\"<ref>\"Homosexual ordination vote widens gap between Presbyterian factions\". ''ReligionToday''. 20 June 2001.</ref>\n\nThose who hold a more liberal view of the Bible as a human witness to the glory of God, the work of fallible humans who wrote from a limited experience unusual only for the insight they have gained through their inspired struggle to know God in the midst of a troubled world. Therefore, they tend not to accept such doctrines as inerrancy. These churches also tend to retain the social activism of their evangelical forebears of the 19th century, placing particular emphasis on those teachings of scripture that teach compassion for the poor and concern for [[social justice]].\n\nThe message of personal [[salvation]] is, generally speaking, of the good that comes to oneself and the world through following the New Testament's [[ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] admonition to love others without hypocrisy or prejudice. Toward these ends, the \"spirit\" of the New Testament, more than the letter, is infallible and authoritative.\n\nThere are some movements that believe the Bible contains the teachings of Jesus but who reject the churches that were formed following its publication. These people believe all individuals can communicate directly with God and therefore do not need guidance or doctrines from a church. These people are known as [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]].\n\n===Messianic Judaism===\n[[Messianic Judaism]] generally holds the same view of New Testament authority as evangelical Protestants.<ref name = \"Beit Simcha\">{{cite web\n | url         = http://www.beitsimcha.org/our-beliefs/\n | title       = Our Beliefs\n | publisher   = Beit Simcha\n | accessdate  = 7 June 2012\n | quote       = To study the whole and authoritative Word of God, including the Tenach (Hebrew Scriptures) and the B'rit Chadasha (New Covenant) under the leading of the Holy Spirit.\n}}\n</ref> According to the view of some Messianic Jewish congregations, Jesus did not annul the Torah, but that its interpretation is revised and ultimately explained through the Apostolic Scriptures.<ref name=\"KehilatTNuvahSOF1\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.graftedin.com/essential-statement-of-faith/\n |title       = Essential Statement of Faith\n |accessdate  = 7 June 2012\n |publisher   = The Harvest: A Messianic Charismatic Congregation\n |quote       = We believe that the Torah (five books of Moses) is a comprehensive summary of God's foundational laws and ways, as found in both the Tanakh and Apostolic Scriptures.

They view it as the written revelation and good news of the [[Messiah]], the [[Atonement in Christianity|ransom sacrifice of Jesus]], and the [[Kingdom of God]], explaining and expounding the Hebrew Bible, not replacing but vitally supplementing it. They also view the New Testament as the primary instruction guide for Christian living, and [[church discipline]]. They generally call the New Testament the \"Christian Greek Scriptures\", and see only the \"covenants\" as \"old\" or \"new\", but not any part of the actual Scriptures themselves.<ref>\"Equipped For Every Good Work\".

The first fundamental belief of the Seventh-Day Adventist church stated that \"The Holy Scriptures are the [[Biblical infallibility|infallible]] revelation of [God's] will.\" [[Seventh-day Adventist theology|Adventist theologians]] generally reject the \"verbal inspiration\" position on Scripture held by many conservative [[evangelical Christians]]. They believe instead that God inspired the thoughts of the biblical authors and apostles, and that the writers then expressed these thoughts in their own words.<ref>{{cite book|title=Seventh-day Adventists Believe|author=Ministerial Association, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists |year=2005 |publisher=Pacific Press Publishing Association |edition=2nd |pages=14\u201316}}</ref> This view is popularly known as \"thought inspiration\", and most Adventist members hold to that view.

Therefore, the fourth commandment concerning the Sabbath is as applicable to Christian believers as the other nine. Adventists have often taught a distinction between \"moral law\" and \"ceremonial law\". According to Adventist beliefs, the moral law continues into the \"New Testament era\", but the ceremonial law was done away with by Jesus.\n\nHow the [[Mosaic law]] should be applied came up at Adventist conferences in the past, and Adventist theologians such as [[A. T. Jones]] and [[E. J. Waggoner]] looked at the problem addressed by Paul in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] as not the ceremonial law, but rather the wrong use of the law ([[legalism (theology)|legalism]]). They were opposed by [[Uriah Smith]] and [[George Ide Butler|George Butler]] at the 1888 Conference. Smith in particular thought the Galatians issue had been settled by Ellen White already, yet in 1890 she claimed justification by faith is \"the [[Three Angels' Messages|third angel's message]] in verity.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nEllen White interpreted {{bibleverse||Colossians|2:14|NIV}} as saying that the ceremonial law was nailed to the cross.<ref>White, Ellen (2015).

In addition to some language derived from the New Testament in the [[liturgy]] itself (e.g., the [[Trisagion]] may be based on Apocalypse 4:8, and the beginning of the \"Hymn of Praise\" draws upon Luke 2:14), the reading of extended passages from the New Testament is a practice common to almost all [[Christian worship]], liturgical or not.\n\nThese [[Lection|readings]] are most often part of an established [[lectionary]] (i.e., [[Lection|selected texts]] to be read at church services on specific days), and (together with an Old Testament reading and a [[Psalms (Christian)|Psalm]]) include a non-gospel reading from the New Testament and culminate with a [[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel reading]]. No readings from the [[Book of Revelation]], however, are included in the standard [[lectionary]] of the [[Orthodox church|Eastern Orthodox churches]].\n\nCentral to the [[Christian liturgy]] is the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] or \"Holy Communion\". The [[Words of Institution]] that begin this rite are drawn directly from 1 Corinthians 11:23\u201326. In addition, the communal recitation of the [[Lord's Prayer]] (in the form found in the Gospel of Matthew 6:9\u201313) is also a standard feature of [[Christian worship]].\n\n==In the arts==\n{{Further|Nativity of Jesus in art|Passion play}}\n[[File:GaudenzioFerrari StorieCristo Varallo2.jpg|thumb|[[Gaudenzio Ferrari]]'s ''Stories of the Life and Passion of Christ'', fresco, 1513, Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, Varallo Sesia, Italy.
