Among the 20 standard amino acids, the following are aromatic: [[phenylalanine]], [[tryptophan]], [[tyrosine]], and [[histidine]]. However, in addition to being aromatic, tyrosine can be classified as a polar amino acid. In addition, while histidine contains an aromatic ring, its basic properties cause it to be predominantly classified as a polar amino acid; however, the compound is still aromatic.   \n\n== Chemical Structure and Properties ==\nAlthough their chemical structure is consistent with that of an [[amino acid]], aromatic amino acids do not absorb light in the [[electromagnetic spectrum|visible region]]. Instead, they absorb [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]] at a wavelength above 250 nm and produce [[Fluorescence|fluroescence]].
