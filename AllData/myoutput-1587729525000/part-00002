{"title_page": "Gin palace", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=March 2013}}\n[[Image:Princess Victoria Pub.jpg|thumb|[[Princess Victoria (public house)|Princess Victoria]], [[Uxbridge Road]], [[London]]]]\n\nA '''gin palace''' (also '''gin house'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/gin_house|work=lexico.com|title=Definition gin house}}</ref> and '''gin shop''')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finedictionary.com/Gin-shop.html|work=finedictionary.com|title=Gin-Shop Definitions}}</ref> is an [[England|English]] name originally for a lavish bar selling [[gin]], later transferred by association to late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[pub]]s designed in a similar style.\n\n==Architecture==\nIn the 18th century, gin shops or 'dram shops' were just small shops (often originally [[pharmacy|chemist's shops]] as gin originally had medicinal associations) that sold gin mostly to take away, or to drink standing up. As the legislation changed establishments generally became larger; they also had to be licensed and sell [[ale]] or [[wine]]. In the late 1820s the first 'Gin Palaces' were built, Thompson and Fearon's in [[Holborn]] and Weller's in [[Old Street]], [[London]]. They were based on the new fashionable shops being built at the time, fitted out at great expense and lit by [[Gas lighting|gas light]]s. They were thought to be vulgar at the time, although hugely popular. [[Charles Dickens]] described them as \"perfectly dazzling when contrasted with the darkness and dirt we have just left\u2026\" in his ''[[Sketches by Boz]]''.\n\nThe design influenced many aspects of later Victorian [[public house|pubs]], even after gin had declined in importance as a drink; the bar in pubs is based on the shop counter of the gin palace, designed for swift service and ideal for attaching [[beer pump]]s; the ornate mirrors and etched glass of the late 19th century. The term has survived for any pub in the late 19th-century style; as this was the peak of pub building in Britain the style has become associated with the pub, even though none of the original gin palaces survives.\n\nWell-preserved examples of the late 19th-century style include the [[Princess Louise (pub)|Princess Louise]] in Holborn, the [[Princess Victoria (public house)|Princess Victoria]], [[Uxbridge Road]], London, and the [[The Philharmonic Dining Rooms|Philharmonic Dining Rooms]] in [[Liverpool]].
