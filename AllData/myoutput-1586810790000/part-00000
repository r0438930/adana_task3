{"title_page": "Naval Photographic Science Laboratory", "text_new": "{{No footnotes|date=April 2020}}\nThe United States '''Naval Photographic Science Laboratory''' (NPSL) was opened in the midst of the Second World War, on 24 Feb 1943, at the [[Anacostia]] [[Naval Air Station]], [[Washington, D. C.]].  It was established under the military command of the Chief of the Navy's [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] with the mission of centralizing the production and preservation of all naval related photography operations.\n\n==History==\nDuring its four years of operation, the NPSL provided photographic services to the [[United States Navy|Navy]], including the conducting of research to develop new photographic equipment and techniques in the areas of motion picture production, still photography, aerial photography, graphic arts and photolithography. It was responsible for providing secret and confidential services at the Anacostia facilities for [[Photographic printing|printing]] and [[Photographic processing|developing films]] in quantity and for the training of [[motion picture]] [[camera operators]]. It was the Navy's sole wartime unit for the production of [[training film]]s, and ultimately expsnded its operations to provide production services for any military or governmental activity during the last two years of the war. The NPSL also served as a storehouse for copies of motion pictures and still photographs sent to the laboratory from war-time fleet and air base operations. \n\nIn 1947, while maintaining its operations base at Anacostia, the NPSL was renamed the United States Naval Photographic Center (NPC).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [https://catalog.archives.gov/id/10466012 National Archives Catalog]\n* R.
