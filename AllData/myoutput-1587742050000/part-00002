(novel)|Washington, D.C.]]'' This includes the families of conservative Democratic Senator James Burden Day, and powerful newspaper publisher Blaise Sanford. The book inserts the character of Caroline Sanford, Blaise's half-sister and publishing partner, who was introduced in the [[prequel]]s to ''Washington, D.C''. It covers America's entry into [[World War II]] and the national politics of that time in some detail, and highlights of the post-war years, and then closes with a year-2000 retrospective.\n\n==Explanation of the novel's title==\nThe title is more ironic than ambivalent, referring principally to hopes expressed by young Americans shortly after winning World War II.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe action centers around President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s maneuvers to get the [[United States]] into [[World War II]] while keeping his 1940 campaign pledge to America voters that \"No sons of yours will ever fight in a foreign war, unless attacked.\" Vidal makes the case that 1) the U.S had backed [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] into a corner with the oil and trade embargo, as well as massive aid to [[Republic of China (1912-49)|China]] and unconditional demands Japan could never accept; 2) the U.S. provoked Japan into attacking; and 3) the U.S. had broken Japan's military codes and knew of Japan's pending attack, but intentionally withheld warning [[Pearl Harbor]]. This was to arouse the U.S. populace and [[Consequences of the attack on Pearl Harbor|bring the United States into the war]], so the U.S could take its place as the post-war dominant superpower.\n\nThe novel gives considerable attention to the rise of [[Wendell L. Willkie]] to become the Republican candidate in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 Presidential Election]], suggesting that Roosevelt's supporters grossly intervened in the affairs of the rival party to make sure that the Interventionist Willkie would win over Isolationist rivals, thus ensuring that whoever won the elections the US would enter the war. The book's detailed depiction of the [[1940 Republican National Convention]] in Philadelphia even suggests\u2014though offering no proof\u2014that [[murder]] was resorted to in order to place a Willkie supporter in a key position of control over the convention's technical arrangements, and that such control was used to sabotage former president [[Herbert Hoover]]'s bid for a comeback.\n\nAn often repeated theme is the reference to Roosevelt\u2014and afterwards to [[Harry S. Truman]]\u2014as \"Emperor of the World\", to [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] as \"The Empress\", to the Roosevelt [[White House]] as \"The Imperial Court\", to [[Washington D.C.]] as \"The Imperial City\" and so on. Roosevelt is compared to [[Augustus]], the founder of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nThe novel also covers some of the American artistic and cultural scene after the war, with attention given to [[John La Touche (musician)|John La Touche]], [[Dawn Powell]], [[Tennessee Williams]], and postwar [[Hollywood]].\n\n==Characters==\nHistorical characters:\n* [[William Randolph Hearst]],\n* [[Franklin D.
