He is best known as the writer of ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' (1959), the basis for the [[Psycho (1960 film)|film of the same name]] by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. His fondness for a [[pun]] is evident in the titles of his story collections such as ''Tales in a Jugular Vein'', ''Such Stuff as Screams Are Made Of'' and ''Out of the Mouths of Graves''.\n\nBloch wrote hundreds of short stories and over 30 novels. He was one of the youngest members of the Lovecraft Circle and began his professional writing career immediately after graduation, aged 17. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], who was the first to seriously encourage his talent. However, while Bloch started his career by emulating Lovecraft and his brand of \"[[cosmic horror]]\", he later specialized in crime and horror stories dealing with a more psychological approach.\n\nBloch was a contributor to [[pulp magazine]]s such as ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in his early career, and was also a prolific screenwriter and a major contributor to [[science fiction fanzine]]s and [[fandom]] in general.\n\nHe won the [[Hugo Award]] (for his story \"[[That Hell-Bound Train]]\"), the [[Bram Stoker Award]], and the [[World Fantasy Award]]. He served a term as president of the [[Mystery Writers of America]] (1970) and was a member of that organization and of [[Science Fiction Writers of America]], the [[Writers Guild of America]], the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] and the Count Dracula Society. In 2008, [[The Library of America]] selected Bloch's essay \"The Shambles of [[Ed Gein]]\" (1962)<ref>The essay was previously collected in ''The Lost Bloch, Volume Three: Crimes and Punishments'' (2002) {{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?995871 |title= Bibliography: The Shambles of Ed Gein |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref> for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American [[true crime]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.loa.org/volume.jsp?RequestID=289&section=toc |author= [[Library of America]] |title= True Crime: An American Anthology |publisher= Library of America |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHis favorites among his own novels were ''The Kidnapper'', ''The Star Stalker'', ''Psycho'', ''Night-World,'' and ''Strange Eons''.<ref name=Larson>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Randall |title= The Bloch Companion: Collected Interviews 1969\u20131986|year=1989 |publisher=Starmont House |isbn=1-55742-147-1}}</ref> His work has been extensively adapted into films, television productions, comics, and audiobooks.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBloch was born in Chicago, the son of Raphael \"Ray\" Bloch (1884\u20131952), a bank cashier, and his wife Stella Loeb (1880\u20131944), a social worker, both of [[Germans|German]] [[Jewish]] descent. Bloch's family moved to [[Maywood, Illinois|Maywood]], a Chicago suburb, when he was five; he lived there until he was ten. He attended the [[Methodist Church]] there, despite his parents' Jewish heritage, and attended Emerson Grammar School.<ref>Robert Bloch. ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography''. NY: Tor, 1993, p. 30</ref> In 1925, at eight years of age, living in Maywood, he attended (alone at night) a screening of [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]]'s film ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925). The scene of Chaney removing his mask terrified the young Bloch (\"it scared the living hell out of me and I ran all the way home to enjoy the first of about two years of recurrent nightmares\"). It also sparked his interest in horror.<ref name=\"April 6, 1935\">''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]]'', April 6, 1935.</ref><ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\">Reprint of 1949 autobiographical article in Graeme Flanagan, ''Robert Bloch: A Bio-Bibliography''. Canberra: Flanagan, 1979, pp. 6-12</ref> Bloch was a precocious child and found himself in fourth grade when he was eight. He also obtained a pass into the adult section of the Public Library, where he read omnivorously. Bloch considered himself a budding artist and worked in pencil sketching and watercolours, but myopia in adolescence seemed to effectively bar art as a career. He had passions for German-made lead [[toy soldiers]] and for [[silent cinema]].<ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\"/>\n\nIn 1929, Bloch's father Ray Bloch lost his bank job, and the family moved to [[Milwaukee]], where Stella worked at the [[Lizzie Black Kander|Milwaukee Jewish Settlement]] [[settlement house]]. Robert attended Washington, then [[Lincoln High School (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|Lincoln High School]], where he met lifelong friend Harold Gauer. Gauer was editor of ''The Quill'', Lincoln's [[literary magazine]], and accepted Bloch's first published short story, a horror story titled \"The Thing\" (the \"thing\" of the title was [[Death (personification)|Death]]). Both Bloch and Gauer graduated from Lincoln in 1934<ref name=\"April 6, 1935\"/> during the height of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Bloch was involved in the drama department at Lincoln and wrote and performed in school vaudeville skits.\n\n==Career==\n===''Weird Tales'' magazine and the influence of H. P. Lovecraft===\n[[File:Weird Tales February 1939.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's \"Death is an Elephant\", the cover story of the February 1939 ''Weird Tales'', appeared under his \"Nathan Hindin\" pen name]]\n[[File:Amazing stories 194403.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"It's a Small World\" was the cover story for the March 1944 issue of ''Amazing Stories'']]\nDuring the 1930s, Bloch was an avid reader of the pulp magazine ''[[Weird Tales]]'', which he had discovered at the age of ten in 1927. In the Chicago Northwestern Railroad depot with his parents and aunt Lil, his aunt offered to buy him any magazine he wanted and he picked ''Weird Tales'' (Aug 1927 issue) off the newsstand over her shocked protest.<ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\"/><ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed).

''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, pp. 46-47.</ref> He began his readings of the magazine with the first instalment of [[Otis Adelbert Kline]]'s \"The Bride of Osiris\" which dealt with a secret Egyptian city called Karneter located beneath Bloch's birth city of [[Chicago]].<ref>Robert Bloch, \"The Searcher After Horror\". ''World Fantasy 1983: Sixty Years of Weird Tales'' (convention program book), p. 15</ref> The Depression came in the early 1930s. He later recalled, in accepting the Lifetime Achievement Award at the First World Fantasy Convention (1975), how \"times were very hard. ''Weird Tales'' cost twenty-five cents in a day when most pulp magazines cost a dime. I remember that meant a lot to me.\" He went on to relate how he would get up very early on the last day of the month, with twenty-five cents saved from his monthly allowance of one dollar, and would run all the way to a combination tobacco/magazine store and buy the new ''Weird Tales'' issue, sometimes smuggling it home under his coat if the cover was particularly risqu\u00e9.<ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards''. NY: Doubleday, 1977, pp. 48-49</ref> His parents were not impressed with [[Hugh Doak Rankin]]'s sexy covers for the magazine, and when the Bloch family moved to Milwaukeee in 1928 young Bloch gradually abandoned his interest. But by the time he had entered high school, he returned to reading ''Weird Tales'' during convalescence from flu.<ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\"/>\n\n[[H. P. Lovecraft]], a frequent contributor to ''Weird Tales'', became one of his favorite writers. The first of Lovecraft's stories he had read was \"[[Pickman's Model]],\" in ''Weird Tales'' for October 1927.<ref name=\"Robert Bloch 1993, pp. 49\">Robert Bloch. ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, p. 49.</ref> Bloch wrote: \"In school I was forced to squirm my way through the works of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], [[James Russell Lowell|James Lowell]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]. In 'Pickman's Model', the ghouls ate all three. Now that, I decided, was poetic justice.\"<ref name=\"Robert Bloch 1993, pp. 49\"/> As a teenager, Bloch wrote a fan letter to Lovecraft (1933), asking where he could find copies of earlier stories of Lovecraft's that Bloch had missed.<ref>Robert Bloch. ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, pp. 64-65.</ref> Lovecraft lent them to him.

Bloch took up Lovecraft's offer in late April 1933, sending him two short items, \"The Gallows\" and another work whose title is unknown.<ref>S. T. Joshi, \"A Literary Tutelage: Robert Bloch and H.

NY: Hippocampus Press, 2014, 548-565.</ref>\n\nLovecraft also suggested Bloch write to other members of the Lovecraft Circle, including [[August Derleth]], [[Robert H. Barlow]], [[Clark Ashton Smith]], [[Donald Wandrei]], [[Frank Belknap Long]], [[Henry S. Whitehead]], [[E. Hoffman Price]], [[Bernard Austin Dwyer]] and [[J. Vernon Shea]]. Bloch's first completed tales were \"Lilies,\" \"The Laughter of a Young Ghoul\" and \"The Black Lotus\". Bloch submitted these to ''Weird Tales''; editor Farnsworth Wright summarily rejected them all. However Bloch successfully placed \"Lilies\" in the semi-professional magazine ''Marvel Tales'' (Winter 1934) and \"Black Lotus\" in ''[[Unusual Stories]]'' (1935). Bloch later commented, \"I figured I'd better do something different or I'd end up as a florist.\"<ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards.'' NY: Doubleday, 1977, p. 50</ref>\n\nBloch graduated from high school in June, 1934. He then wrote a story which promptly (six weeks later) sold to ''Weird Tales.'' Bloch's first publication in ''Weird Tales'' was a letter criticising the [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] stories of [[Robert E. Howard]]. His first professional sales, at the age of 17 (July 1934), to ''Weird Tales,'' were the short stories \"The Feast in the Abbey\" and \"The Secret in the Tomb\". \"Feast ...\" appeared first, in the January 1935 issue,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?59533 |author= Von Ruff, Al |title= Bibliography: The Feast in the Abbey |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref> which actually went on sale November 1, 1934; \"The Secret in the Tomb\" appeared in the May 1935 ''Weird Tales''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?63765 |author= Von Ruff, Al |title= Bibliography: The Secret in the Tomb |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBloch's correspondence with Derleth led to a visit to Derleth's home in Sauk City, Wisconsin (the headquarters of [[Arkham House]]).<ref>Robert Bloch. ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, p. 80.</ref> Bloch was impressed by Derleth who \"fulfilled my expectations as a writer by wearing this purple velvet smoking jacket. That impressed me even more because Derleth didn't even smoke.\"<ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards.'' NY: Doubleday, 1977, pp. 48-49</ref> Following this, and continued correspondence with Lovecraft, Bloch went to Chicago and met [[Farnsworth Wright]], the then editor of ''Weird Tales''. He also met the first ''Weird Tales'' writer outside of Derleth he had encountered - [[Otto Binder]].<ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards.'' NY: Doubleday, 1977, p. 49</ref>\n\nBloch's early stories were strongly influenced by Lovecraft. Indeed, a number of his stories were set in, and extended, the world of Lovecraft's [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. These include \"The Dark Demon\", in which the character Gordon is a figuration of Lovecraft, and which features [[Nyarlathotep]]; \"The Faceless God\" (features Nyarlathotep); \"The Grinning Ghoul\" (written after the manner of Lovecraft) and \"The Unspeakable Betrothal\" (vaguely attached to the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]). It was Bloch who invented, for example, the oft-cited Mythos texts ''[[De Vermis Mysteriis]]'' and ''[[Cthulhu Mythos arcane literature#Cultes des Goules|Cultes des Goules]]''. Many other stories influenced by Lovecraft were later collected in Bloch's volume ''Mysteries of the Worm'' (now in its third, expanded edition). In 1935, Bloch wrote the tale \"Satan's Servants\", on which Lovecraft lent much advice, but none of the prose was by Lovecraft; this tale did not appear in print until 1949, in ''[[Something About Cats and Other Pieces]]''.\n\nThe young Bloch appears, thinly disguised, as the character [[Robert Harrison Blake|Robert Blake]] in Lovecraft's story \"[[The Haunter of the Dark]]\" (1936), which is dedicated to Bloch. Bloch was the only individual to whom Lovecraft ever dedicated a story.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} In this story, Lovecraft kills off Robert Blake, the Bloch-based character, repaying a \"courtesy\" Bloch earlier paid Lovecraft with his 1935 tale \"[[The Shambler from the Stars (Short Story)|The Shambler from the Stars]]\", in which the Lovecraft-inspired figure dies; the story goes so far as to use Bloch's then-current address (620 East Knapp Street) in Milwaukee.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blog.loa.org/2010/09/what-robert-bloch-owes-to-h-p-lovecraft.html |author= [[Library of America]] |date= September 23, 2010 |title= What Robert Bloch owes to H. P. Lovecraft |publisher= Reader's Almanac: The Official Blog of the [[Library of America]] |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref> (Bloch even had a signed certificate from Lovecraft [and some of his creations] giving Bloch permission to kill Lovecraft off in a story.) Bloch later recalled \"believe me, beyond all doubt, I don't know anyone else I'd rather be killed by.\"<ref name=\"Robert Bloch 1977, p. 51\">\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards.'' NY: Doubleday, 1977, p. 51</ref> Bloch later wrote a third tale, \"The Shadow From the Steeple\", picking up where \"The Haunter of the Dark\" finished (''Weird Tales'' Sept 1950).\n\nLovecraft's death in 1937 deeply affected Bloch, who was then aged only 20. He recalled \"Part of me died with him, I guess, not only because he was not a god, he was mortal, that is true, but because he had so little recognition in his own lifetime. There were no novels or collections published, no great realization,  even here in Providence, of what was lost.\" <ref name=\"Robert Bloch 1977, p. 51\"/> Elsewhere he wrote, \"the news of his fate came to me as a shattering blow; all the more so because the world at large ignored his passing. Only my parents and a few correspondents seemed to sense my shock, and my feeling that a part of me had died with him.\"\n\nAfter Lovecraft's death in 1937, Bloch continued writing for ''Weird Tales'', where he became one of its most popular authors. He also began contributing to other pulps, such as the science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. Bloch broadened the scope of his fiction. His horror themes included [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] (\"Mother of Serpents\"), the [[conte cruel]] (\"The Mandarin's Canaries\"), [[demonic possession]] (\"Fiddler's Fee\"), and [[black magic]] (\"Return to the Sabbat\"). Bloch visited [[Henry Kuttner]] in California in 1937. Bloch's first science fiction story, \"The Secret of the Observatory\", was published in ''Amazing Stories'' (August 1938).\n\n===Milwaukee Fictioneers and the Depression===\nIn 1935 Bloch joined a writers' group, The Milwaukee Fictioneers, members of which included [[Stanley Weinbaum]], [[Ralph Milne Farley]] and [[Raymond A. Palmer]]. Another member of the group was Gustav Marx, who offered Bloch a job writing copy in his advertising firm, also allowing Bloch to write stories in his spare time in the office. Bloch was close friends with [[C.L. Moore]] and her husband [[Henry Kuttner]], who visited him in Milwaukee.\n\nDuring the years of the Depression, Bloch appeared regularly in dramatic productions, writing and performing in his own sketches. Around 1936 he sold some gags to radio comedians [[Stoopnagle and Budd]], and to [[Roy Atwell]]. Also in 1936, his tale \"The Grinning Ghoul\" was published in ''Weird Tales'' (June); \"The Opener of the Way\" appeared in ''Weird Tales'' (Oct); \"Mother of Serpents\" appeared in the December issue. The December issue also contained Lovecraft's tale \"The Haunter of the Dark\" in which he killed off young author \"Robert Blake\".\n\nIn 1937, following Lovecraft's death, \"The Mannikin\" appeared in ''Weird Tales'' for April. ''Weird Tales'' published \"Return to the Sabbath\" in July 1938. Bloch's first science fiction story, \"The Secret of the Observatory\" appeared in ''Amazing Stories'' (Aug 1938). In a profile accompanying this tale, Bloch described himself as \"tall, dark, unhandsome\" with \"all the charm and personality of a swamp adder\". He noted that \"I hate everything\", but reserved particular dislike for \"bean soup, red nail polish, house-cleaning, and optimists\".<ref>\"Meet the Authors\", ''Amazing Stories'', August 1938, p.146</ref>\n\n=== Campaign manager for Carl Zeidler ===\nIn 1939, Bloch was contacted by James Doolittle, who was managing the campaign for [[List of mayors of Milwaukee|Mayor of Milwaukee]] of a little-known assistant city attorney named [[Carl Zeidler]]. He was asked to work on Zeidler's speechwriting, advertising, and photo ops, in collaboration with Harold Gauer. They created elaborate campaign shows; in Bloch's 1993 autobiography, ''Once Around the Bloch'', he gives an inside account of the campaign, and the innovations he and Gauer came up with \u2013 for instance, the original releasing-balloons-from-the-ceiling shtick. He comments bitterly on how, after Zeidler's victory, they were ignored and not even paid their promised salaries. He ends the story with a wryly philosophical point:\n\n{{quote|If Carl Zeidler had not asked Jim Doolittle to manage his campaign, Doolittle would never have contacted me about it. And the only reason Doolittle knew me to begin with was because he read my yarn (\"The Cloak\") in ''Unknown''. Rattling this chain of circumstances, one may stretch it a bit further. If I had not written a little [[vampire]] story called \"The Cloak\", Carl Zeidler might never have become mayor of Milwaukee.}}\n\nAlso in 1939, two of Bloch's tales were published: \"The Strange Flight of Richard Clayton\" (''Amazing Stories,'' August) and \"The Cloak\" (''Unknown,'' March).\n\n===1940s and 1950s===\n[[File:Fantastic adventures 195008.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's \"The Devil With You\" was the cover story in the July 1950 issue of ''Fantastic Adventures''.]]\n[[File:Imagination 195106.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novella \"Hell's Angel\" was the cover story in the June 1951 issue of ''[[Imagination (magazine)|Imagination]]'', illustrated by [[Hannes Bok]].]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195301-02 v1 n2.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's completion of the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] fragment \"[[The Light-House]]\" was touted by ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]'' as \"A New Edgar Allan Poe Masterpiece\".]]\n[[File:Other worlds 195306.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"The Thinking Cap\" was the cover story in the June 1953 issue of ''[[Other Worlds Science Stories|Other Worlds]]'', illustrated by [[Hannes Bok]]]]\n[[File:Imaginative tales 195501.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's 1950 novella \"The Devil with You\" was retitled \"Black Magic Holiday\" when it was reprinted in ''[[Imaginative Tales]]'' in 1955.]]\n[[File:Imaginative tales 195503.jpg|thumb|right|However, Bloch's 1942 novella \"Mr. Margate's Mermaid\" retained its original title when it was reprinted later in 1955.]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195806.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"Terror in Cut-Throat Cove\" was the cover story for the June 1958 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195905.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"The Hungry Eye\" was cover-featured on the May 1959 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195907.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's \"The Last Plea\" was the cover story for the July 1959 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.]]\n[[File:Fantastic 196001.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"The Funnel of God\" took the cover of the January 1960 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.]]\nIn October 1941, the tale \"A Good Knight's Work\" in ''[[Unknown Worlds]]'' first appeared. Shortly thereafter, Bloch created the [[Damon Runyon]]-esque humorous series character Lefty Feep in the story \"Time Wounds All Heels\" ''[[Fantastic Adventures]]'' (April 1942). Around the same time, he began work as an advertising copywriter at the Gustav Marx Advertising Agency, a position he held until 1953. Marx allowed Bloch to write stories in the office in quiet times. Bloch published a total of 23 Lefty Feep stories in ''Fantastic Adventures'', the last one published in 1950, but the bulk appeared during World War II. Feep's character name had actually been coined by Bloch's friend/collaborator Harold Gauer for their unpublished novel ''In the Land of Sky-Blue Ointments'',<ref>\"Lefty Feep and I\" in Bloch's ''Out of My head''. Cambridge MA: NESFA Press, 1986, 125\u201330.</ref> Bloch also worked for a time in local [[vaudeville]] and tried to break into writing for nationally known performers.\n\nBloch gradually evolved away from Lovecraftian imitations towards a unique style of his own. One of the first distinctly \"Blochian\" stories was \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\",  (''Weird Tales'', July 1943). The story was Bloch's take on the [[Jack the Ripper]] legend, and was filled out with more genuine factual details of the case than many other fictional treatments.<ref name=casebook>{{cite web |url=http://www.casebook.org/dissertations/dst-bloch.html |title=Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper |first= Eduardo |last=Zinna |work=Casebook: Jack the Ripper}}</ref> It cast the Ripper as an eternal being who must make [[human sacrifice]]s to extend his [[immortality]].<ref>Meikle, p. 110</ref> It was adapted for both radio (in ''Stay Tuned for Terror'') and television (as an episode of ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]'' in 1961 adapted by [[Barr\u00e9 Lyndon]]).<ref name=w&b68>Woods and Baddeley, p. 68</ref> Bloch followed up this story with a number of others in a similar vein dealing with half-historic, half-legendary figures such as the [[Man in the Iron Mask]] (\"Iron Mask\", 1944), the [[Marquis de Sade]] (\"The Skull of the Marquis de Sade\", 1945) and [[Lizzie Borden]] (\"Lizzie Borden Took an Axe ...\", 1946).\n\nIn 1944, [[Laird Cregar]] performed Bloch's tale \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" over a coast-to-coast radio network<ref>Jacket copy (front flap) Robert Bloch. ''The opener of the Way.'' Sauk City, WI: Arkham House, 1945.</ref>\n\nTowards the end of World War Two, in 1945, Bloch was asked to write 39 15-minute episodes of his own radio horror show called ''Stay Tuned for Terror''. Many of the programs were adaptations of his own pulp stories. (None of the episodes, which were all broadcast, are extant).<ref>For further information see \"Stay Tuned for Terror\" in Bloch's ''Out of My Head''. Cambridge MA; NESFA Press, 1986, 33\u201341</ref>[http://www.radiohorrorhosts.com/staytuned.html][http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-Stay-Tuned-For-Terror.html]. The same year he published \"The Skull of the [[Marquis de Sade]]\" (''Weird Tales,'' Sept). [[August Derleth]]'s [[Arkham House]], Lovecraft's publisher, published Bloch's first collection of short stories, ''The Opener of the Way'', in an edition of 2,000 copies, with jacket art by [[Ronald Clyne]]. At the same time, his best-known early tale, \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\", received considerable attention through dramatization on radio and reprinting in anthologies. This story, as noted below, involving a Ripper who has found literal immortality through his crimes, has been widely imitated (or plagiarized); Bloch himself would return to the theme (see below). Stories published in 1946 include \"Enoch\" (''Weird Tales'', Sept) and ''[[Lizzie Borden]] Took an Axe'' (''Weird Tales'', Nov).\n\nBloch's first novel was published in hardcover - the thriller ''The Scarf'' ([[Dial Press|The Dial Press]] 1947; the Fawcett Gold medal paperback of 1966 features a revised text). It tells the story of a writer, Daniel Morley, who uses real women as models for his characters. But as soon as he is done writing the story, he is compelled to murder them, and always the same way: with the maroon scarf he has had since childhood. The story begins in [[Minneapolis]] and follows him and his trail of dead bodies to [[Chicago]], [[New York City]], and finally [[Hollywood]], where his hit novel is going to be turned into a movie, and where his self-control may have reached its limit.\n\nIn 1948, Bloch was the Guest of Honor at [[Torcon I]], [[World Science Fiction Convention]], [[Toronto]], Canada. In 1952 he published \"Lucy Comes to Stay\"(Weird Tales, Jan).\n\nBloch published three novels in 1954 \u2013 ''Spiderweb'', ''The Kidnapper'' and ''The Will to Kill'' as he endeavored to support his family. That same year he was a weekly guest panellist on the TV quiz show ''It's a Draw''. ''Shooting Star'' (1958), a mainstream novel, was published in a double volume with a collection of Bloch's stories titled ''Terror in the Night''. ''This Crowded Earth'' (1958) was science fiction.\n\nWith the demise of ''Weird Tales'', Bloch continued to have his fiction published in ''[[Amazing Stories|Amazing]]'', ''[[Fantastic]]'', ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'', and ''[[Fantastic Universe]]''; he was a particularly frequent contributor to ''[[Imagination (magazine)|Imagination]]'' and ''[[Imaginative Tales]]''. His output of thrillers increased and he began to appear regularly in ''[[The Saint (magazine)|The Saint]]'', ''[[Ellery Queen]]'' and similar mystery magazines, and to such suspense and horror-fiction magazine projects as ''Shock''.\n\n===Jack the Ripper===\nBloch continued to revisit the Jack the Ripper theme. His contribution to [[Harlan Ellison]]'s 1967 science fiction anthology ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' was a story, \"[[A Toy for Juliette]]\", which evoked both Jack the Ripper and the [[Marquis de Sade]] in a time-travel story. The same anthology had Ellison's sequel to it titled \"[[The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World]]\". His earlier idea of the Ripper as an immortal being resurfaced in Bloch's contribution to the original ''[[Star Trek]]'' series episode \"[[Wolf in the Fold]]\". His 1984 novel ''Night of the Ripper'' is set during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]] and follows the investigation of Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]] in attempting to apprehend the Ripper, and includes some famous Victorians such as [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] within the storyline.\n\n===''Psycho''===\nBloch won the [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]]  for \"That Hellbound Train\" in 1959, the same year that his sixth novel, ''Psycho,'' was published.  Bloch had written an earlier short story involving [[dissociative identity disorder]], \"The Real Bad Friend\", which appeared in the February 1957 ''Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine'', that foreshadowed the 1959 novel ''Psycho''. However, ''Psycho'' also has thematic links to the story \"Lucy Comes to Stay.\" Also in 1959, Bloch delivered a lecture titled \"Imagination and Modern Social Criticism\" at the University of Chicago; this was reprinted in the critical volume ''The Science Fiction Novel'' (Advent Publishers). His story \"The Hungry Eye\" appeared in ''Fantastic'' (May). This was also the year in which, despite having graduated from painting watercolours to oils, he gave up painting completely.<ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\"/>\n\n[[Norman Bates]], the main character in ''Psycho'', was very loosely based on two people. First was the real-life [[serial killer]] [[Ed Gein]], about whom Bloch later wrote a fictionalized account, \"The Shambles of Ed Gein\". (The story can be found in ''Crimes and Punishments: The Lost Bloch, Volume 3'').  Second, it has been indicated by several people, including Noel Carter (wife of [[Lin Carter]]) and [[Chris Steinbrunner]], as well as allegedly by Bloch himself, that Norman Bates was partly based on Calvin Beck, publisher of ''[[Castle of Frankenstein]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmonster.com/horror29.html|title=THE ASTOUNDING B MONSTER - HORROR|author=|date=|website=www.bmonster.com}}</ref> Bloch's basing of the character of Norman Bates on Ed Gein is discussed in the documentary ''Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield'', which can be found on Disc 2 of the DVD release of the remake of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (2003). However, Bloch also commented that it was the situation itself - a mass murderer living undetected and unsuspected in a typical small town in middle America - rather than Gein himself who sparked Bloch's storyline. He writes: \"Thus the real-life murderer was not the role model for my character Norman Bates. Ed Gein didn't own or operate a motel. Ed Gein didn't kill anyone in the shower. Ed Gein wasn't into taxidermy. Ed Gein didn't stuff his mother, keep her body in the house, dress in a drag outfit, or adopt an alternative personality. These were the functions and characteristics of Norman Bates, and Norman Bates didn't exist until I made him up. Out of my own imagination, I add, which is probably the reason so few offer to take showers with me.\"<ref>Robert Bloch. \"Building the Bates Motel\". ''Mystery Scene'', No 40 (1993):19, 26, 27, 58.</ref>\n\nThough Bloch had little involvement with the [[Psycho (1960 film)|film version of his novel]], which was directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] from an adapted screenplay by [[Joseph Stefano]], he was to become most famous as its author. Bloch was awarded a special [[Mystery Writers of America]] scroll for the novel in 1961.\n\nThe novel is one of the first examples at full length of Bloch's use of modern urban horror relying on the horrors of interior psychology rather than the supernatural. \"By the mid-1940s, I had pretty well mined the vein of ordinary supernatural themes until it had become varicose,\" Bloch explained to [[Douglas E. Winter]] in an interview. \"I realized, as a result of what went on during [[World War II]] and of reading the more widely disseminated work in psychology, that the real horror is not in the shadows, but in that twisted little world inside our own skulls.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darkecho.com/darkecho/horroronline/bloch.html|title=DarkEcho/HorrorOnline: Robert Bloch: Behind the Bates Motel|author=|date=|website=www.darkecho.com}}</ref> While Bloch was not the first horror writer to utilise a psychological approach (it originates in the work of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]), Bloch's psychological approach in modern times was comparatively unique.\n\nBloch's agent, Harry Altshuler, received a \"blind bid\" for the novel \u2013 the buyer's name was not mentioned \u2013 of $7,500 for screen rights to the book. The bid eventually went to $9,500, which Bloch accepted. Bloch had never sold a book to Hollywood before. His contract with [[Simon & Schuster]] included no bonus for a film sale. The publisher took 15 percent according to contract, while the agent took his 10%; Bloch wound up with about $6,750 before taxes. Despite the enormous profits generated by Hitchcock's film, Bloch received no further direct compensation.\n\nOnly Hitchcock's film was based on Bloch's novel. The later films in the ''Psycho'' series bear no relation to either of Bloch's sequel novels. Indeed, Bloch's proposed script for the film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' was rejected by the studio (as were many other submissions), and it was this that he subsequently adapted for his own sequel novel.\n\nThe film ''[[Hitchcock (film)|Hitchcock]]'' (2012) tells the story of Alfred Hitchcock's making of the film version of ''Psycho''. Although it mentions Bloch and his novel, Bloch himself is not a character in the movie.\n\n===The early 1960s: Screenwriting and fiction===\nFollowing his move to Hollywood, around 1960, Bloch had multiple assignments from various television companies. However, he was not allowed to write for five months when the [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]] had a strike. After the strike was over, he became a frequent scriptwriter for television and film projects in the mystery, suspense, and horror genre. His first assignments were for the [[Macdonald Carey]] vehicle, ''[[Lock-Up (TV series)|Lock-Up]]'', (penning five episodes) as well as one for ''[[Whispering Smith]]''. Further TV work included an episode of ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'' (\"I Kiss Your Shadow\"), 10 episodes of ''[[Thriller (US TV series)|Thriller]]'' (1960\u201362, several based on his own stories), and 10 episodes of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' (1960\u201362). His short story collection ''Pleasant Dreams - Nightmares'' was published by Arkham House in 1960.\n\nBloch wrote the screenplay for ''[[The Cabinet of Caligari]]'' (1962), which is only very loosely related to [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari|the 1920 German silent film]], and proved to be an unhappy experience. The same year, Bloch penned the story and teleplay \"[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Alfred Hitchcock Presents)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]\" for ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. The episode was shelved when the [[NBC television|NBC Television Network]] and sponsor [[Revlon]] called its ending \"too gruesome\" (by 1960s standards) for airing. Bloch was pleased later when the episode was included in the program's syndication package to affiliate stations, where not one complaint was registered. Today, due to [[public domain]] status, the episode is readily available in home media formats from numerous distributors and is even available on free [[video on demand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/alfred-hitchcock-presents-the-sorcerers-apprentice-181237|title=Alfred Hitchcock Presents: The Sorcerer's Apprentice (1962) - Joseph Leytis|author=|date=|website=AllMovie}}</ref><ref>Grams, Martin and Patrik Winstrom, ''The Alfred Hitchcock Presents Companion'' c. 2001, OTR Publishing, Churchville, Maryland, {{ISBN|0-9703310-1-0}} (pp. 385\u2013388)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/suppressed/sorcerer.asp|title=The Sorcerer's Apprentice|author=|date=August 16, 2013|website=snopes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/AlfredHitchcockPresentsTheSorcerersApprentice|title=Alfred Hitchcock Presents: The Sorcerers Apprentice|last=FreeBmovies|date=|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nHis TV work did not slow Bloch's fictional output. In the early 1960s he published several novels, including ''The Dead Beat'' (1960), and ''Firebug '' (1961), for which [[Harlan Ellison]], then an editor at Regency Books, contributed the first 1,200 words.<ref>The novel ''Blood Runs Cold'' also appeared in 1961.{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|p=255}}</ref> In 1962 numerous works appeared in book form. Bloch's novel ''The Couch'' (1962) (the basis for the screenplay of his first movie, filmed the same year) was published.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|p=270}}</ref> That year several Bloch short story collections- ''Atoms and Evil'', ''More Nightmares'' and ''Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper'' were published, as well as another novel, ''Terror'' (whose working titles included ''Amok'' and ''Kill for Kali''). Editor Earl Kemp assembled a selection of Bloch's prolific output for fan magazines as ''The Eight Stage of Fandom: Selections from 25 years of Fan Writing'' (Advent Publishers). In this era, [[Stephen King]] later wrote, \"What Bloch did with such novels as ''The Deadbeat'', ''The Scarf'', ''Firebug'', ''Psycho'', and ''The Couch'' was to re-discover the suspense novel and reinvent the antihero as first discovered by [[James M. Cain|James Cain]].\"<ref>Stephen King, \"A Profile of Robert Bloch\". ''World Fantasy 1983: Sixty Years of Weird Tales'' (convention program book), pp. 11-12</ref>\n\nDuring 1963, Bloch saw into print two further collections of short stories, ''Bogey men'' and ''Horror-7''. In 1964 Bloch married Eleanor Alexander and wrote original screenplays for two films produced and directed by [[William Castle]], ''[[Strait-Jacket]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Night Walker (film)|The Night Walker]]'' (also 1964), along with ''[[The Skull (film)|The Skull]]'' (1965).The latter film was based on his short story \"The Skull of the Marquis de Sade\".\n\n===The 1960s and 1970s: Film & TV writing===\nBloch's further TV writing in this period included ''The Alfred Hitchcock Hour'' (7 episodes, 1962\u20131965),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Perry|first=Dennis R.|author2=Carl H.

He penned three scripts for the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' series which were screened in 1966 and 1967: \"[[What Are Little Girls Made Of?]]\", \"[[Wolf in the Fold]]\" (another [[Jack the Ripper]] variant), and \"[[Catspaw (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Catspaw]]\".\n\nIn 1968, Bloch returned to London to do two episodes for the English [[Hammer Films]] series ''[[Journey to the Unknown]]'' for [[Twentieth Century Fox]]. One of the episodes, \"The Indian Spirit Guide\", was included in the American TV movie ''[[Journey to Midnight]]'' (1968). The other episode was \"Girl of My Dreams,\" co-scripted with [[Michael J. Bird]] and based on the eponymous story by [[Richard Matheson]].\n\nFollowing the movie ''[[The Skull]]'' (1965), which was based on a Bloch story but scripted by [[Milton Subotsky]], he wrote the screenplays for five feature films produced by [[Amicus Productions]] \u2013 ''[[The Psychopath]]'' (1966), ''[[The Deadly Bees]]'' (co-written with Anthony Marriott, 1967), ''[[Torture Garden (film)|Torture Garden]]'' (also 1967), ''[[The House That Dripped Blood]]'' (1971) and ''[[Asylum (1972 horror film)|Asylum]]'' (1972). The last two films featured stories written by Bloch that were printed first in anthologies he wrote in the 1940s and early 1950s.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Bloch wrote two TV movies for director [[Curtis Harrington]] \u2013 ''[[The Cat Creature]]'' (1973) (an ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'') and ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]''. ''The Cat Creature'' was an unhappy production experience for Bloch. Producer Doug Cramer wanted to do an update of ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' (1942), the [[Val Lewton]]-produced film. Bloch commented: \"Instead, I suggested a blending of the elements of several well-remembered films, and came up with a story line which dealt with the Egyptian cat-goddess ([[Bastet|Bast]]), reincarnation and the first bypass operation ever performed on an artichoke heart.\"<ref>Robert Bloch, ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, p. 360</ref> A detailed account of the troubled production of the film is described in Bloch's autobiography.<ref>Robert Bloch, ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, pp. 360\u201363</ref>\n\nBloch meanwhile (interspersed between his screenplays for Amicus Productions and other projects), penned single episodes for ''[[Night Gallery]]'' (1971), ''[[Ghost Story (TV series)|Ghost Story]]'' (1972), ''[[The Manhunter]]'' (1974), and ''[[Gemini Man (TV series)|Gemini Man]]'' (1976).\n\n===The later 1960s and 1970s: Fiction===\nIn 1965, two further collections of short stories appeared - ''The Skull of the [[Marquis de Sade]]'' and ''Tales in a Jugular Vein''. 1966 saw Bloch win the [[Ann Radcliffe]] Award for Television and publisher yet another collection of shorts - ''Chamber of Horrors''. Bloch returned to the site of his childhood home at 620 East Knapp St, Milwaukee (the address used by Lovecraft for the character Robert Blake in ''[[The Haunter of the Dark]]'') only to find the neighborhood razed and the entire neighborhood leveled and replaced by expressway approaches.<ref name=\"First World Fantasy Convention p. 8\">\"Time-Travelling with H.

He also published another classic story of [[Jack the Ripper]], \"A Toy for Juliette\" in [[Harlan Ellison]]'s ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' anthology. In 1968 he published a duo of long sf novellas as ''This Crowded Earth and Ladies'Day''. His novel ''The Star Stalker'' was published, and ''Dragons and Nightmares'' (the first collection of Lefty Feep stories) appeared in hardcover (Mirage Press).\n\nIn 1965, two further collections of short stories appeared - ''The Skull of the [[Marquis de Sade]]'' and ''Tales in a Jugular Vein''.

''Ladies Day/This Crowded Earth'' and ''The Star Stalker'' followed in 1968. The collection ''Bloch and Bradbury'' (a collaboration with [[Ray Bradbury]]) and the hardcover novel ''The Todd Dossier'', originally as by Collier Young, were published in 1969.\n\nBloch won a second Ann Radcliffe Award, this time for Literature, in 1969.

In 1972 he published another novel, ''Night-World''. In 1973 Bloch was the Guest of Honor at [[Torcon II]], [[World Science Fiction Convention]], Toronto. 1974 saw the publication of his novel ''American Gothic'', inspired by the true life story of serial killer [[H.H. Holmes]].\n\nIn 1975, Bloch won the Lifetime Achievement Award at the First [[World Fantasy Convention]] held in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. The award was a bust of H.P. Lovecraft. The occasion of this convention was the first time Bloch actually visited the city of Providence.<ref>''Time-Travelling with H. P. Lovecraft''in ''The First World Fantasy Convention: Three Authors Remember'' (West Warwick, RI: Necronomicon Press), p. 7</ref> An audio recording was made of Robert Bloch during that 1975 convention, accessible online at  [https://archive.org/details/FirstWorldFantasyConvention1975]\n\nIn 1976, two records of Bloch recordings of his stories were released by Alternate World recordings - ''Gravely, Robert Bloch!\" and ''Blood! The Life and Times of jack the Ripper!\"(with Harlan Ellison). In 1977, [[Lester del Rey]] edited ''The Best of Robert Bloch'' for Del Rey books. Two further short story collections appeared - ''Cold Chills'' and ''The King of Terrors.''\n\nBloch continued to published short story collections throughout this period. His ''Selected Stories'' (reprinted in paperback with the incorrect title ''The Complete Stories'') appeared in three volumes just prior to his death, although many previously uncollected tales have appeared in volumes published since 1997 (see below). Bloch also contributed the story \"Heir Apparent,\" set in [[Andre Norton]]'s Witch World, to ''Tales of the Witch World'' (Vol. 1), NY: Tor, 1987.\n\n1979 saw the publication of Bloch's novel ''There is a Serpent in Eden'' (also reissued as ''The Cunning''), and two more short story collections, ''Out of the Mouths of graves'' and ''Such Stuff as Screams Are Made Of.''\n\nHis numerous novels of the 1970s demonstrate Bloch's thematic range, from science fiction - ''Sneak Preview'' (1971) - through horror novels such as the loving Lovecraftian tribute ''Strange Eons'' (Whispers Press, 1978) and the non-supernatural mystery ''There is a Serpent in Eden'' (1979);\n\n===The 1980s===\nBloch's screenplay-writing career continued active through the 1980s, with teleplays for ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' (one episode, 1980), ''[[Darkroom (TV series)|Darkroom]]'' (two episodes,1981), ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985 TV series)|Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' (1 episode, 1986), ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]'' (three episodes, 1984\u201387 - \"Beetles\", \"A Case of the Stubborns\" and \"Everybody needs a Little Love\") and ''[[Monsters (TV series)|Monsters]]'' (three episodes, 1988\u20131989 - \"The Legacy\", \"Mannikins of Horror\", and \"Reaper\"). No further screen work appeared in the last five years before his death, although an adaptation of his \"collaboration\" with [[Edgar Allan Poe]], \"The Lighthouse\", was filmed as an episode of ''[[The Hunger (TV series)|The Hunger]]'' in 1998.\n\n''The First World Fantasy Convention: Three Authors Remember'' (Necronomicon Press, 1980) features reminiscences of that important event by Bloch, [[T. E. D. Klein|T.E.D. Klein]] and [[Fritz Leiber]]. In 1981, Zebra Books issued the first edition of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]-themed collection ''Mysteries of the Worm''. This item was reprinted some years later in an expanded edition by Chaosium.\n\nBloch's sequel to the original ''Psycho'' (''[[Psycho II (novel)|Psycho II]]'' was published in 1982 (unrelated to the film of the same title) and in 1983 he novelised ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]''. His novel ''[[Night of the Ripper]]'' (1984), was another return to one of Bloch's favourite themes, the Jack the Ripper murders of 1888.\n\nIn 1986, Scream Press published the hardcover omnibus ''Unholy Trinity'', collecting three by now scarce Bloch novels, ''The Scarf'', ''The Dead Beat'' and ''The Couch.'' A second retrospective selection of Bloch's nonfiction was published by NESFA Press as ''Out of My Head.''\n\nIn 1987,  Bloch celebrated his 70th birthday. Underwood-Miller issued the three-volume hardcover set ''The Selected Stories of Robert Bloch'' (individual volumes titled ''Final reckonings'', ''Bitter Ends'' and ''Last Rites''). When Citadel press reissued this in paperback they incorrectly named it ''The Collected Stories of Robert Bloch.'' The same year a collection, ''Midnight Pleasures'' appeared from Doubleday, and ''Lost in Time and Space with Lefty Feep'' (Creatures at Large Press) collected a number of the stories on the Lefty Feep series. The latter was the first of a projected series of three volumes, however the further volumes were never published. In 1988, Tor Books reissued Bloch's scarce second novel, ''The Kidnapper.'\n\nIn 1989, several works were published: the collection, ''Fear and Trembling'', the thriller novel ''Lori'' (later adapted as a standalone graphic novel) and another omnibus of long out-of-print early novels, ''Screams'' (containing ''The Will to Kill'', ''Firebug'' and ''The Star Stalker''). Randall D. Larson issued ''The Robert Bloch Companion: Collected Interviews 1969-1986'' (Starmont House), together with ''Robert Bloch'' (Starmont Reader's Guide No 37), an exhaustive study of Bloch's work, and ''The Complete Robert Bloch: An Illustrated, Comprehensive Bibliography'' (Fandom Unlimited Enterprises). Larson's three books were bound in hardcover and distributed by Borgo Press.\n\n===The 1990s: Last works===\nBloch's novel, ''The Jekyll Legacy'' (1990), was a collaboration with [[Andre Norton]] and a sequel to [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''.  The same year he returned to the Norman Bates \"mythos\" with ''Psycho House'' (Tor), the third Psycho novel. As with the second novel in the sequence, it bears no relation to the film titled ''Psycho III''. It would prove to be his last published novel.\n\nIn February 1991, he was given the Honor of Master of Ceremonies at the first [[World Horror Convention]] held in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Weird Tales issued a special Robert Bloch issue in Spring, including his screenplay for the televised version of his tale \"Beetles\"\". A standalone chapbook of the story \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" was issued in both hardcover and paperback by Pulphouse, and Bloch co-edited with [[Martin H. Greenberg]] the original anthology ''Psycho-Paths'' (Tor). In 1991 Bloch contributed an Introduction to ''In Search of Lovecraft'' by [[J. Vernon Shea]].\n\nIn 1992, Bloch celebrated his 75th birthday with a bash at a Los Angeles mystery/horror bookstore which was attended by many sf/horror notables. In 1993, he published his \"unauthorized autobiography\", ''Once Around the Bloch'' (Tor) and edited the original anthology ''Monsters in Our Midst''.\n\nIn early 1994, Fedogan and Bremer published a collection of 39 of his stories, ''The Early Fears''. Bloch began editing a new original anthology, ''[[Robert Bloch's Psychos]]'' but was unable to complete work on it prior to his death; Martin H. Greenberg finished the work posthumously and the book appeared several years later (1997).\n\n==Personal life==\nOn October 2, 1940, Bloch married Marion Ruth Holcombe; it was reportedly a marriage of convenience designed to keep Bloch out of the army.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|p=158}}</ref> During their marriage, she suffered (initially undiagnosed) [[tuberculosis]] of the bone, which affected her ability to walk.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|pp=215\u2013217}}</ref>\n\nAfter working for 11 years for the Gustav Marx Advertising Agency in Milwaukee, Bloch left in 1953 and moved to [[Weyauwega, Wisconsin|Weyauwega]], Marion's home town, so she could be close to friends and family. Although she was eventually cured of tuberculosis, she and Bloch divorced in 1963. Bloch's daughter Sally (born 1943) elected to stay with him.\n\nOn January 18, 1964, Bloch met recently widowed Eleanor (\"Elly\") Alexander (n\u00e9e Zalisko) \u2014 who had lost her first husband, writer/producer John Alexander, to a heart attack three months earlier \u2014 and made her his second wife in a civil ceremony on the following October 16.

Elly remained in the Los Angeles area for several years after selling their Laurel Canyon Home to fans of Bloch, eventually choosing to go home to Canada to be closer to her own family. She died March 7, 2007, at the Betel Home in [[Selkirk, Manitoba]], Canada.

He is best known as the writer of ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' (1959), the basis for the [[Psycho (1960 film)|film of the same name]] by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. His fondness for a [[pun]] is evident in the titles of his story collections such as ''Tales in a Jugular Vein'', ''Such Stuff as Screams Are Made Of'' and ''Out of the Mouths of Graves''.\n\nBloch wrote hundreds of short stories and over 30 novels. He was one of the youngest members of the Lovecraft Circle and began his professional writing career immediately after graduation, aged 17. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], who was the first to seriously encourage his talent. However, while Bloch started his career by emulating Lovecraft and his brand of \"[[cosmic horror]]\", he later specialized in crime and horror stories dealing with a more psychological approach.\n\nBloch was a contributor to [[pulp magazine]]s such as ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in his early career, and was also a prolific screenwriter and a major contributor to [[science fiction fanzine]]s and [[fandom]] in general.\n\nHe won the [[Hugo Award]] (for his story \"[[That Hell-Bound Train]]\"), the [[Bram Stoker Award]], and the [[World Fantasy Award]]. He served a term as president of the [[Mystery Writers of America]] (1970) and was a member of that organization and of [[Science Fiction Writers of America]], the [[Writers Guild of America]], the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] and the Count Dracula Society. In 2008, [[The Library of America]] selected Bloch's essay \"The Shambles of [[Ed Gein]]\" (1962)<ref>The essay was previously collected in ''The Lost Bloch, Volume Three: Crimes and Punishments'' (2002) {{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?995871 |title= Bibliography: The Shambles of Ed Gein |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref> for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American [[true crime]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.loa.org/volume.jsp?RequestID=289&section=toc |author= [[Library of America]] |title= True Crime: An American Anthology |publisher= Library of America |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHis favorites among his own novels were ''The Kidnapper'', ''The Star Stalker'', ''Psycho'', ''Night-World,'' and ''Strange Eons''.<ref name=Larson>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Randall |title= The Bloch Companion: Collected Interviews 1969\u20131986|year=1989 |publisher=Starmont House |isbn=1-55742-147-1}}</ref> His work has been extensively adapted into films, television productions, comics, and audiobooks.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBloch was born in Chicago, the son of Raphael \"Ray\" Bloch (1884\u20131952), a bank cashier, and his wife Stella Loeb (1880\u20131944), a social worker, both of [[Germans|German]] [[Jewish]] descent. Bloch's family moved to [[Maywood, Illinois|Maywood]], a Chicago suburb, when he was five; he lived there until he was ten. He attended the [[Methodist Church]] there, despite his parents' Jewish heritage, and attended Emerson Grammar School.<ref>Robert Bloch. ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography''. NY: Tor, 1993, p. 30</ref> In 1925, at eight years of age, living in Maywood, he attended (alone at night) a screening of [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]]'s film ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925). The scene of Chaney removing his mask terrified the young Bloch (\"it scared the living hell out of me and I ran all the way home to enjoy the first of about two years of recurrent nightmares\"). It also sparked his interest in horror.<ref name=\"April 6, 1935\">''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]]'', April 6, 1935.</ref><ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\">Reprint of 1949 autobiographical article in Graeme Flanagan, ''Robert Bloch: A Bio-Bibliography''. Canberra: Flanagan, 1979, pp. 6-12</ref> Bloch was a precocious child and found himself in fourth grade when he was eight. He also obtained a pass into the adult section of the Public Library, where he read omnivorously. Bloch considered himself a budding artist and worked in pencil sketching and watercolours, but myopia in adolescence seemed to effectively bar art as a career. He had passions for German-made lead [[toy soldiers]] and for [[silent cinema]].<ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\"/>\n\nIn 1929, Bloch's father Ray Bloch lost his bank job, and the family moved to [[Milwaukee]], where Stella worked at the [[Lizzie Black Kander|Milwaukee Jewish Settlement]] [[settlement house]]. Robert attended Washington, then [[Lincoln High School (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|Lincoln High School]], where he met lifelong friend Harold Gauer. Gauer was editor of ''The Quill'', Lincoln's [[literary magazine]], and accepted Bloch's first published short story, a horror story titled \"The Thing\" (the \"thing\" of the title was [[Death (personification)|Death]]). Both Bloch and Gauer graduated from Lincoln in 1934<ref name=\"April 6, 1935\"/> during the height of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Bloch was involved in the drama department at Lincoln and wrote and performed in school vaudeville skits.\n\n==Career==\n===''Weird Tales'' magazine and the influence of H. P.

In the Chicago Northwestern Railroad depot with his parents and aunt Lil, his aunt offered to buy him any magazine he wanted and he picked ''Weird Tales'' (Aug 1927 issue) off the newsstand over her shocked protest.<ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\"/><ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed).

He later recalled, in accepting the Lifetime Achievement Award at the First World Fantasy Convention (1975), how \"times were very hard. ''Weird Tales'' cost twenty-five cents in a day when most pulp magazines cost a dime. I remember that meant a lot to me.\" He went on to relate how he would get up very early on the last day of the month, with twenty-five cents saved from his monthly allowance of one dollar, and would run all the way to a combination tobacco/magazine store and buy the new ''Weird Tales'' issue, sometimes smuggling it home under his coat if the cover was particularly risqu\u00e9.<ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards''. NY: Doubleday, 1977, pp. 48-49</ref> His parents were not impressed with [[Hugh Doak Rankin]]'s sexy covers for the magazine, and when the Bloch family moved to Milwaukeee in 1928 young Bloch gradually abandoned his interest. But by the time he had entered high school, he returned to reading ''Weird Tales'' during convalescence from flu.<ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\"/>\n\n[[H. P. Lovecraft]], a frequent contributor to ''Weird Tales'', became one of his favorite writers. The first of Lovecraft's stories he had read was \"[[Pickman's Model]],\" in ''Weird Tales'' for October 1927.<ref name=\"Robert Bloch 1993, pp. 49\">Robert Bloch. ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, p. 49.</ref> Bloch wrote: \"In school I was forced to squirm my way through the works of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], [[James Russell Lowell|James Lowell]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]].

Barlow]], [[Clark Ashton Smith]], [[Donald Wandrei]], [[Frank Belknap Long]], [[Henry S. Whitehead]], [[E. Hoffman Price]], [[Bernard Austin Dwyer]] and [[J. Vernon Shea]]. Bloch's first completed tales were \"Lilies,\" \"The Laughter of a Young Ghoul\" and \"The Black Lotus\". Bloch submitted these to ''Weird Tales''; editor Farnsworth Wright summarily rejected them all. However Bloch successfully placed \"Lilies\" in the semi-professional magazine ''Marvel Tales'' (Winter 1934) and \"Black Lotus\" in ''[[Unusual Stories]]'' (1935). Bloch later commented, \"I figured I'd better do something different or I'd end up as a florist.\"<ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards.'' NY: Doubleday, 1977, p. 50</ref>\n\nBloch graduated from high school in June, 1934. He then wrote a story which promptly (six weeks later) sold to ''Weird Tales.'' Bloch's first publication in ''Weird Tales'' was a letter criticising the [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] stories of [[Robert E. Howard]]. His first professional sales, at the age of 17 (July 1934), to ''Weird Tales,'' were the short stories \"The Feast in the Abbey\" and \"The Secret in the Tomb\". \"Feast ...\" appeared first, in the January 1935 issue,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?59533 |author= Von Ruff, Al |title= Bibliography: The Feast in the Abbey |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref> which actually went on sale November 1, 1934; \"The Secret in the Tomb\" appeared in the May 1935 ''Weird Tales''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?63765 |author= Von Ruff, Al |title= Bibliography: The Secret in the Tomb |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBloch's correspondence with Derleth led to a visit to Derleth's home in Sauk City, Wisconsin (the headquarters of [[Arkham House]]).<ref>Robert Bloch. ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, p. 80.</ref> Bloch was impressed by Derleth who \"fulfilled my expectations as a writer by wearing this purple velvet smoking jacket. That impressed me even more because Derleth didn't even smoke.\"<ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards.'' NY: Doubleday, 1977, pp. 48-49</ref> Following this, and continued correspondence with Lovecraft, Bloch went to Chicago and met [[Farnsworth Wright]], the then editor of ''Weird Tales''. He also met the first ''Weird Tales'' writer outside of Derleth he had encountered - [[Otto Binder]].<ref>\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards.'' NY: Doubleday, 1977, p. 49</ref>\n\nBloch's early stories were strongly influenced by Lovecraft. Indeed, a number of his stories were set in, and extended, the world of Lovecraft's [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. These include \"The Dark Demon\", in which the character Gordon is a figuration of Lovecraft, and which features [[Nyarlathotep]]; \"The Faceless God\" (features Nyarlathotep); \"The Grinning Ghoul\" (written after the manner of Lovecraft) and \"The Unspeakable Betrothal\" (vaguely attached to the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]). It was Bloch who invented, for example, the oft-cited Mythos texts ''[[De Vermis Mysteriis]]'' and ''[[Cthulhu Mythos arcane literature#Cultes des Goules|Cultes des Goules]]''. Many other stories influenced by Lovecraft were later collected in Bloch's volume ''Mysteries of the Worm'' (now in its third, expanded edition). In 1935, Bloch wrote the tale \"Satan's Servants\", on which Lovecraft lent much advice, but none of the prose was by Lovecraft; this tale did not appear in print until 1949, in ''[[Something About Cats and Other Pieces]]''.\n\nThe young Bloch appears, thinly disguised, as the character [[Robert Harrison Blake|Robert Blake]] in Lovecraft's story \"[[The Haunter of the Dark]]\" (1936), which is dedicated to Bloch. Bloch was the only individual to whom Lovecraft ever dedicated a story.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} In this story, Lovecraft kills off Robert Blake, the Bloch-based character, repaying a \"courtesy\" Bloch earlier paid Lovecraft with his 1935 tale \"[[The Shambler from the Stars (Short Story)|The Shambler from the Stars]]\", in which the Lovecraft-inspired figure dies; the story goes so far as to use Bloch's then-current address (620 East Knapp Street) in Milwaukee.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blog.loa.org/2010/09/what-robert-bloch-owes-to-h-p-lovecraft.html |author= [[Library of America]] |date= September 23, 2010 |title= What Robert Bloch owes to H.

Bloch later recalled \"believe me, beyond all doubt, I don't know anyone else I'd rather be killed by.\"<ref name=\"Robert Bloch 1977, p. 51\">\"Robert Bloch's Acceptance Speech\" (for Lifetime Achievement) in Gahan Wilson (ed). ''First World Fantasy Awards.'' NY: Doubleday, 1977, p. 51</ref> Bloch later wrote a third tale, \"The Shadow From the Steeple\", picking up where \"The Haunter of the Dark\" finished (''Weird Tales'' Sept 1950).\n\nLovecraft's death in 1937 deeply affected Bloch, who was then aged only 20. He recalled \"Part of me died with him, I guess, not only because he was not a god, he was mortal, that is true, but because he had so little recognition in his own lifetime. There were no novels or collections published, no great realization,  even here in Providence, of what was lost.\" <ref name=\"Robert Bloch 1977, p. 51\"/> Elsewhere he wrote, \"the news of his fate came to me as a shattering blow; all the more so because the world at large ignored his passing. Only my parents and a few correspondents seemed to sense my shock, and my feeling that a part of me had died with him.\"\n\nAfter Lovecraft's death in 1937, Bloch continued writing for ''Weird Tales'', where he became one of its most popular authors. He also began contributing to other pulps, such as the science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. Bloch broadened the scope of his fiction. His horror themes included [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] (\"Mother of Serpents\"), the [[conte cruel]] (\"The Mandarin's Canaries\"), [[demonic possession]] (\"Fiddler's Fee\"), and [[black magic]] (\"Return to the Sabbat\"). Bloch visited [[Henry Kuttner]] in California in 1937. Bloch's first science fiction story, \"The Secret of the Observatory\", was published in ''Amazing Stories'' (August 1938).\n\n===Milwaukee Fictioneers and the Depression===\nIn 1935 Bloch joined a writers' group, The Milwaukee Fictioneers, members of which included [[Stanley Weinbaum]], [[Ralph Milne Farley]] and [[Raymond A. Palmer]]. Another member of the group was Gustav Marx, who offered Bloch a job writing copy in his advertising firm, also allowing Bloch to write stories in his spare time in the office. Bloch was close friends with [[C.L. Moore]] and her husband [[Henry Kuttner]], who visited him in Milwaukee.\n\nDuring the years of the Depression, Bloch appeared regularly in dramatic productions, writing and performing in his own sketches. Around 1936 he sold some gags to radio comedians [[Stoopnagle and Budd]], and to [[Roy Atwell]]. Also in 1936, his tale \"The Grinning Ghoul\" was published in ''Weird Tales'' (June); \"The Opener of the Way\" appeared in ''Weird Tales'' (Oct); \"Mother of Serpents\" appeared in the December issue. The December issue also contained Lovecraft's tale \"The Haunter of the Dark\" in which he killed off young author \"Robert Blake\".\n\nIn 1937, following Lovecraft's death, \"The Mannikin\" appeared in ''Weird Tales'' for April. ''Weird Tales'' published \"Return to the Sabbath\" in July 1938. Bloch's first science fiction story, \"The Secret of the Observatory\" appeared in ''Amazing Stories'' (Aug 1938). In a profile accompanying this tale, Bloch described himself as \"tall, dark, unhandsome\" with \"all the charm and personality of a swamp adder\". He noted that \"I hate everything\", but reserved particular dislike for \"bean soup, red nail polish, house-cleaning, and optimists\".<ref>\"Meet the Authors\", ''Amazing Stories'', August 1938, p.146</ref>\n\n=== Campaign manager for Carl Zeidler ===\nIn 1939, Bloch was contacted by James Doolittle, who was managing the campaign for [[List of mayors of Milwaukee|Mayor of Milwaukee]] of a little-known assistant city attorney named [[Carl Zeidler]]. He was asked to work on Zeidler's speechwriting, advertising, and photo ops, in collaboration with Harold Gauer. They created elaborate campaign shows; in Bloch's 1993 autobiography, ''Once Around the Bloch'', he gives an inside account of the campaign, and the innovations he and Gauer came up with \u2013 for instance, the original releasing-balloons-from-the-ceiling shtick. He comments bitterly on how, after Zeidler's victory, they were ignored and not even paid their promised salaries. He ends the story with a wryly philosophical point:\n\n{{quote|If Carl Zeidler had not asked Jim Doolittle to manage his campaign, Doolittle would never have contacted me about it. And the only reason Doolittle knew me to begin with was because he read my yarn (\"The Cloak\") in ''Unknown''. Rattling this chain of circumstances, one may stretch it a bit further. If I had not written a little [[vampire]] story called \"The Cloak\", Carl Zeidler might never have become mayor of Milwaukee.}}\n\nAlso in 1939, two of Bloch's tales were published: \"The Strange Flight of Richard Clayton\" (''Amazing Stories,'' August) and \"The Cloak\" (''Unknown,'' March).\n\n===1940s and 1950s===\n[[File:Fantastic adventures 195008.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's \"The Devil With You\" was the cover story in the July 1950 issue of ''Fantastic Adventures''.]]\n[[File:Imagination 195106.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novella \"Hell's Angel\" was the cover story in the June 1951 issue of ''[[Imagination (magazine)|Imagination]]'', illustrated by [[Hannes Bok]].]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195301-02 v1 n2.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's completion of the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] fragment \"[[The Light-House]]\" was touted by ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]'' as \"A New Edgar Allan Poe Masterpiece\".]]\n[[File:Other worlds 195306.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"The Thinking Cap\" was the cover story in the June 1953 issue of ''[[Other Worlds Science Stories|Other Worlds]]'', illustrated by [[Hannes Bok]]]]\n[[File:Imaginative tales 195501.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's 1950 novella \"The Devil with You\" was retitled \"Black Magic Holiday\" when it was reprinted in ''[[Imaginative Tales]]'' in 1955.]]\n[[File:Imaginative tales 195503.jpg|thumb|right|However, Bloch's 1942 novella \"Mr. Margate's Mermaid\" retained its original title when it was reprinted later in 1955.]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195806.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"Terror in Cut-Throat Cove\" was the cover story for the June 1958 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195905.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"The Hungry Eye\" was cover-featured on the May 1959 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.]]\n[[File:Fantastic 195907.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's \"The Last Plea\" was the cover story for the July 1959 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.]]\n[[File:Fantastic 196001.jpg|thumb|right|Bloch's novelette \"The Funnel of God\" took the cover of the January 1960 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.]]\nIn October 1941, the tale \"A Good Knight's Work\" in ''[[Unknown Worlds]]'' first appeared. Shortly thereafter, Bloch created the [[Damon Runyon]]-esque humorous series character Lefty Feep in the story \"Time Wounds All Heels\" ''[[Fantastic Adventures]]'' (April 1942). Around the same time, he began work as an advertising copywriter at the Gustav Marx Advertising Agency, a position he held until 1953. Marx allowed Bloch to write stories in the office in quiet times. Bloch published a total of 23 Lefty Feep stories in ''Fantastic Adventures'', the last one published in 1950, but the bulk appeared during World War II. Feep's character name had actually been coined by Bloch's friend/collaborator Harold Gauer for their unpublished novel ''In the Land of Sky-Blue Ointments'',<ref>\"Lefty Feep and I\" in Bloch's ''Out of My head''. Cambridge MA: NESFA Press, 1986, 125\u201330.</ref> Bloch also worked for a time in local [[vaudeville]] and tried to break into writing for nationally known performers.\n\nBloch gradually evolved away from Lovecraftian imitations towards a unique style of his own. One of the first distinctly \"Blochian\" stories was \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\",  (''Weird Tales'', July 1943). The story was Bloch's take on the [[Jack the Ripper]] legend, and was filled out with more genuine factual details of the case than many other fictional treatments.<ref name=casebook>{{cite web |url=http://www.casebook.org/dissertations/dst-bloch.html |title=Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper |first= Eduardo |last=Zinna |work=Casebook: Jack the Ripper}}</ref> It cast the Ripper as an eternal being who must make [[human sacrifice]]s to extend his [[immortality]].<ref>Meikle, p. 110</ref> It was adapted for both radio (in ''Stay Tuned for Terror'') and television (as an episode of ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]'' in 1961 adapted by [[Barr\u00e9 Lyndon]]).<ref name=w&b68>Woods and Baddeley, p. 68</ref> Bloch followed up this story with a number of others in a similar vein dealing with half-historic, half-legendary figures such as the [[Man in the Iron Mask]] (\"Iron Mask\", 1944), the [[Marquis de Sade]] (\"The Skull of the Marquis de Sade\", 1945) and [[Lizzie Borden]] (\"Lizzie Borden Took an Axe ...\", 1946).\n\nIn 1944, [[Laird Cregar]] performed Bloch's tale \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" over a coast-to-coast radio network<ref>Jacket copy (front flap) Robert Bloch. ''The opener of the Way.'' Sauk City, WI: Arkham House, 1945.</ref>\n\nTowards the end of World War Two, in 1945, Bloch was asked to write 39 15-minute episodes of his own radio horror show called ''Stay Tuned for Terror''. Many of the programs were adaptations of his own pulp stories. (None of the episodes, which were all broadcast, are extant).<ref>For further information see \"Stay Tuned for Terror\" in Bloch's ''Out of My Head''. Cambridge MA; NESFA Press, 1986, 33\u201341</ref>[http://www.radiohorrorhosts.com/staytuned.html][http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-Stay-Tuned-For-Terror.html]. The same year he published \"The Skull of the [[Marquis de Sade]]\" (''Weird Tales,'' Sept). [[August Derleth]]'s [[Arkham House]], Lovecraft's publisher, published Bloch's first collection of short stories, ''The Opener of the Way'', in an edition of 2,000 copies, with jacket art by [[Ronald Clyne]]. At the same time, his best-known early tale, \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\", received considerable attention through dramatization on radio and reprinting in anthologies. This story, as noted below, involving a Ripper who has found literal immortality through his crimes, has been widely imitated (or plagiarized); Bloch himself would return to the theme (see below). Stories published in 1946 include \"Enoch\" (''Weird Tales'', Sept) and ''[[Lizzie Borden]] Took an Axe'' (''Weird Tales'', Nov).\n\nBloch's first novel was published in hardcover - the thriller ''The Scarf'' ([[Dial Press|The Dial Press]] 1947; the Fawcett Gold medal paperback of 1966 features a revised text). It tells the story of a writer, Daniel Morley, who uses real women as models for his characters. But as soon as he is done writing the story, he is compelled to murder them, and always the same way: with the maroon scarf he has had since childhood. The story begins in [[Minneapolis]] and follows him and his trail of dead bodies to [[Chicago]], [[New York City]], and finally [[Hollywood]], where his hit novel is going to be turned into a movie, and where his self-control may have reached its limit.\n\nIn 1948, Bloch was the Guest of Honor at [[Torcon I]], [[World Science Fiction Convention]], [[Toronto]], Canada. In 1952 he published \"Lucy Comes to Stay\"(Weird Tales, Jan).\n\nBloch published three novels in 1954 \u2013 ''Spiderweb'', ''The Kidnapper'' and ''The Will to Kill'' as he endeavored to support his family. That same year he was a weekly guest panellist on the TV quiz show ''It's a Draw''. ''Shooting Star'' (1958), a mainstream novel, was published in a double volume with a collection of Bloch's stories titled ''Terror in the Night''. ''This Crowded Earth'' (1958) was science fiction.\n\nWith the demise of ''Weird Tales'', Bloch continued to have his fiction published in ''[[Amazing Stories|Amazing]]'', ''[[Fantastic]]'', ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'', and ''[[Fantastic Universe]]''; he was a particularly frequent contributor to ''[[Imagination (magazine)|Imagination]]'' and ''[[Imaginative Tales]]''. His output of thrillers increased and he began to appear regularly in ''[[The Saint (magazine)|The Saint]]'', ''[[Ellery Queen]]'' and similar mystery magazines, and to such suspense and horror-fiction magazine projects as ''Shock''.\n\n===Jack the Ripper===\nBloch continued to revisit the Jack the Ripper theme. His contribution to [[Harlan Ellison]]'s 1967 science fiction anthology ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' was a story, \"[[A Toy for Juliette]]\", which evoked both Jack the Ripper and the [[Marquis de Sade]] in a time-travel story. The same anthology had Ellison's sequel to it titled \"[[The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World]]\". His earlier idea of the Ripper as an immortal being resurfaced in Bloch's contribution to the original ''[[Star Trek]]'' series episode \"[[Wolf in the Fold]]\". His 1984 novel ''Night of the Ripper'' is set during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]] and follows the investigation of Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]] in attempting to apprehend the Ripper, and includes some famous Victorians such as [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] within the storyline.\n\n===''Psycho''===\nBloch won the [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]]  for \"That Hellbound Train\" in 1959, the same year that his sixth novel, ''Psycho,'' was published.  Bloch had written an earlier short story involving [[dissociative identity disorder]], \"The Real Bad Friend\", which appeared in the February 1957 ''Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine'', that foreshadowed the 1959 novel ''Psycho''. However, ''Psycho'' also has thematic links to the story \"Lucy Comes to Stay.\" Also in 1959, Bloch delivered a lecture titled \"Imagination and Modern Social Criticism\" at the University of Chicago; this was reprinted in the critical volume ''The Science Fiction Novel'' (Advent Publishers). His story \"The Hungry Eye\" appeared in ''Fantastic'' (May). This was also the year in which, despite having graduated from painting watercolours to oils, he gave up painting completely.<ref name=\"Graeme Flanagan 1979, pp. 6-12\"/>\n\n[[Norman Bates]], the main character in ''Psycho'', was very loosely based on two people. First was the real-life [[serial killer]] [[Ed Gein]], about whom Bloch later wrote a fictionalized account, \"The Shambles of Ed Gein\". (The story can be found in ''Crimes and Punishments: The Lost Bloch, Volume 3'').  Second, it has been indicated by several people, including Noel Carter (wife of [[Lin Carter]]) and [[Chris Steinbrunner]], as well as allegedly by Bloch himself, that Norman Bates was partly based on Calvin Beck, publisher of ''[[Castle of Frankenstein]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmonster.com/horror29.html|title=THE ASTOUNDING B MONSTER - HORROR|author=|date=|website=www.bmonster.com}}</ref> Bloch's basing of the character of Norman Bates on Ed Gein is discussed in the documentary ''Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield'', which can be found on Disc 2 of the DVD release of the remake of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (2003). However, Bloch also commented that it was the situation itself - a mass murderer living undetected and unsuspected in a typical small town in middle America - rather than Gein himself who sparked Bloch's storyline. He writes: \"Thus the real-life murderer was not the role model for my character Norman Bates. Ed Gein didn't own or operate a motel. Ed Gein didn't kill anyone in the shower. Ed Gein wasn't into taxidermy. Ed Gein didn't stuff his mother, keep her body in the house, dress in a drag outfit, or adopt an alternative personality. These were the functions and characteristics of Norman Bates, and Norman Bates didn't exist until I made him up. Out of my own imagination, I add, which is probably the reason so few offer to take showers with me.\"<ref>Robert Bloch. \"Building the Bates Motel\". ''Mystery Scene'', No 40 (1993):19, 26, 27, 58.</ref>\n\nThough Bloch had little involvement with the [[Psycho (1960 film)|film version of his novel]], which was directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] from an adapted screenplay by [[Joseph Stefano]], he was to become most famous as its author. Bloch was awarded a special [[Mystery Writers of America]] scroll for the novel in 1961.\n\nThe novel is one of the first examples at full length of Bloch's use of modern urban horror relying on the horrors of interior psychology rather than the supernatural. \"By the mid-1940s, I had pretty well mined the vein of ordinary supernatural themes until it had become varicose,\" Bloch explained to [[Douglas E. Winter]] in an interview. \"I realized, as a result of what went on during [[World War II]] and of reading the more widely disseminated work in psychology, that the real horror is not in the shadows, but in that twisted little world inside our own skulls.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darkecho.com/darkecho/horroronline/bloch.html|title=DarkEcho/HorrorOnline: Robert Bloch: Behind the Bates Motel|author=|date=|website=www.darkecho.com}}</ref> While Bloch was not the first horror writer to utilise a psychological approach (it originates in the work of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]), Bloch's psychological approach in modern times was comparatively unique.\n\nBloch's agent, Harry Altshuler, received a \"blind bid\" for the novel \u2013 the buyer's name was not mentioned \u2013 of $7,500 for screen rights to the book. The bid eventually went to $9,500, which Bloch accepted. Bloch had never sold a book to Hollywood before. His contract with [[Simon & Schuster]] included no bonus for a film sale. The publisher took 15 percent according to contract, while the agent took his 10%; Bloch wound up with about $6,750 before taxes. Despite the enormous profits generated by Hitchcock's film, Bloch received no further direct compensation.\n\nOnly Hitchcock's film was based on Bloch's novel. The later films in the ''Psycho'' series bear no relation to either of Bloch's sequel novels. Indeed, Bloch's proposed script for the film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' was rejected by the studio (as were many other submissions), and it was this that he subsequently adapted for his own sequel novel.\n\nThe film ''[[Hitchcock (film)|Hitchcock]]'' (2012) tells the story of Alfred Hitchcock's making of the film version of ''Psycho''. Although it mentions Bloch and his novel, Bloch himself is not a character in the movie.\n\n===The early 1960s: Screenwriting and fiction===\nFollowing his move to Hollywood, around 1960, Bloch had multiple assignments from various television companies. However, he was not allowed to write for five months when the [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]] had a strike. After the strike was over, he became a frequent scriptwriter for television and film projects in the mystery, suspense, and horror genre. His first assignments were for the [[Macdonald Carey]] vehicle, ''[[Lock-Up (TV series)|Lock-Up]]'', (penning five episodes) as well as one for ''[[Whispering Smith]]''. Further TV work included an episode of ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'' (\"I Kiss Your Shadow\"), 10 episodes of ''[[Thriller (US TV series)|Thriller]]'' (1960\u201362, several based on his own stories), and 10 episodes of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' (1960\u201362). His short story collection ''Pleasant Dreams - Nightmares'' was published by Arkham House in 1960.\n\nBloch wrote the screenplay for ''[[The Cabinet of Caligari]]'' (1962), which is only very loosely related to [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari|the 1920 German silent film]], and proved to be an unhappy experience. The same year, Bloch penned the story and teleplay \"[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Alfred Hitchcock Presents)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]\" for ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. The episode was shelved when the [[NBC television|NBC Television Network]] and sponsor [[Revlon]] called its ending \"too gruesome\" (by 1960s standards) for airing. Bloch was pleased later when the episode was included in the program's syndication package to affiliate stations, where not one complaint was registered. Today, due to [[public domain]] status, the episode is readily available in home media formats from numerous distributors and is even available on free [[video on demand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/alfred-hitchcock-presents-the-sorcerers-apprentice-181237|title=Alfred Hitchcock Presents: The Sorcerer's Apprentice (1962) - Joseph Leytis|author=|date=|website=AllMovie}}</ref><ref>Grams, Martin and Patrik Winstrom, ''The Alfred Hitchcock Presents Companion'' c. 2001, OTR Publishing, Churchville, Maryland, {{ISBN|0-9703310-1-0}} (pp. 385\u2013388)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/suppressed/sorcerer.asp|title=The Sorcerer's Apprentice|author=|date=August 16, 2013|website=snopes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/AlfredHitchcockPresentsTheSorcerersApprentice|title=Alfred Hitchcock Presents: The Sorcerers Apprentice|last=FreeBmovies|date=|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nHis TV work did not slow Bloch's fictional output. In the early 1960s he published several novels, including ''The Dead Beat'' (1960), and ''Firebug '' (1961), for which [[Harlan Ellison]], then an editor at Regency Books, contributed the first 1,200 words.<ref>The novel ''Blood Runs Cold'' also appeared in 1961.{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|p=255}}</ref> In 1962 numerous works appeared in book form. Bloch's novel ''The Couch'' (1962) (the basis for the screenplay of his first movie, filmed the same year) was published.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|p=270}}</ref> That year several Bloch short story collections- ''Atoms and Evil'', ''More Nightmares'' and ''Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper'' were published, as well as another novel, ''Terror'' (whose working titles included ''Amok'' and ''Kill for Kali''). Editor Earl Kemp assembled a selection of Bloch's prolific output for fan magazines as ''The Eight Stage of Fandom: Selections from 25 years of Fan Writing'' (Advent Publishers). In this era, [[Stephen King]] later wrote, \"What Bloch did with such novels as ''The Deadbeat'', ''The Scarf'', ''Firebug'', ''Psycho'', and ''The Couch'' was to re-discover the suspense novel and reinvent the antihero as first discovered by [[James M. Cain|James Cain]].\"<ref>Stephen King, \"A Profile of Robert Bloch\". ''World Fantasy 1983: Sixty Years of Weird Tales'' (convention program book), pp. 11-12</ref>\n\nDuring 1963, Bloch saw into print two further collections of short stories, ''Bogey men'' and ''Horror-7''. In 1964 Bloch married Eleanor Alexander and wrote original screenplays for two films produced and directed by [[William Castle]], ''[[Strait-Jacket]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Night Walker (film)|The Night Walker]]'' (also 1964), along with ''[[The Skull (film)|The Skull]]'' (1965).The latter film was based on his short story \"The Skull of the Marquis de Sade\".\n\n===The 1960s and 1970s: Film & TV writing===\nBloch's further TV writing in this period included ''The Alfred Hitchcock Hour'' (7 episodes, 1962\u20131965),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Perry|first=Dennis R.|author2=Carl H.

He penned three scripts for the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' series which were screened in 1966 and 1967: \"[[What Are Little Girls Made Of?]]\", \"[[Wolf in the Fold]]\" (another [[Jack the Ripper]] variant), and \"[[Catspaw (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Catspaw]]\".\n\nIn 1968, Bloch returned to London to do two episodes for the English [[Hammer Films]] series ''[[Journey to the Unknown]]'' for [[Twentieth Century Fox]]. One of the episodes, \"The Indian Spirit Guide\", was included in the American TV movie ''[[Journey to Midnight]]'' (1968). The other episode was \"Girl of My Dreams,\" co-scripted with [[Michael J. Bird]] and based on the eponymous story by [[Richard Matheson]].\n\nFollowing the movie ''[[The Skull]]'' (1965), which was based on a Bloch story but scripted by [[Milton Subotsky]], he wrote the screenplays for five feature films produced by [[Amicus Productions]] \u2013 ''[[The Psychopath]]'' (1966), ''[[The Deadly Bees]]'' (co-written with Anthony Marriott, 1967), ''[[Torture Garden (film)|Torture Garden]]'' (also 1967), ''[[The House That Dripped Blood]]'' (1971) and ''[[Asylum (1972 horror film)|Asylum]]'' (1972). The last two films featured stories written by Bloch that were printed first in anthologies he wrote in the 1940s and early 1950s.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Bloch wrote two TV movies for director [[Curtis Harrington]] \u2013 ''[[The Cat Creature]]'' (1973) (an ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'') and ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]''. ''The Cat Creature'' was an unhappy production experience for Bloch. Producer Doug Cramer wanted to do an update of ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' (1942), the [[Val Lewton]]-produced film. Bloch commented: \"Instead, I suggested a blending of the elements of several well-remembered films, and came up with a story line which dealt with the Egyptian cat-goddess ([[Bastet|Bast]]), reincarnation and the first bypass operation ever performed on an artichoke heart.\"<ref>Robert Bloch, ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, p. 360</ref> A detailed account of the troubled production of the film is described in Bloch's autobiography.<ref>Robert Bloch, ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, pp. 360\u201363</ref>\n\nBloch meanwhile (interspersed between his screenplays for Amicus Productions and other projects), penned single episodes for ''[[Night Gallery]]'' (1971), ''[[Ghost Story (TV series)|Ghost Story]]'' (1972), ''[[The Manhunter]]'' (1974), and ''[[Gemini Man (TV series)|Gemini Man]]'' (1976).\n\n===The later 1960s and 1970s: Fiction===\nIn 1965, two further collections of short stories appeared - ''The Skull of the [[Marquis de Sade]]'' and ''Tales in a Jugular Vein''. 1966 saw Bloch win the [[Ann Radcliffe]] Award for Television and publisher yet another collection of shorts - ''Chamber of Horrors''. Bloch returned to the site of his childhood home at 620 East Knapp St, Milwaukee (the address used by Lovecraft for the character Robert Blake in ''[[The Haunter of the Dark]]'') only to find the neighborhood razed and the entire neighborhood leveled and replaced by expressway approaches.<ref name=\"First World Fantasy Convention p. 8\">\"Time-Travelling with H.

He also published another classic story of [[Jack the Ripper]], \"A Toy for Juliette\" in [[Harlan Ellison]]'s ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' anthology. In 1968 he published a duo of long sf novellas as ''This Crowded Earth and Ladies'Day''. His novel ''The Star Stalker'' was published, and ''Dragons and Nightmares'' (the first collection of Lefty Feep stories) appeared in hardcover (Mirage Press).\n\nIn 1965, two further collections of short stories appeared - ''The Skull of the [[Marquis de Sade]]'' and ''Tales in a Jugular Vein''.

In 1968, a duo of long science fiction novellas appeared as ''This Crowded Earth and Ladies'Day'', as did his novel ''The Star Stalker'' and ''Dragons and Nightmares'' (the first collection of Lefty Feep stories from Mirage Press in hardback). ''Ladies Day/This Crowded Earth'' and ''The Star Stalker'' followed in 1968. The collection ''Bloch and Bradbury'' (a collaboration with [[Ray Bradbury]]) and the hardcover novel ''The Todd Dossier'', originally as by Collier Young, were published in 1969.\n\nBloch won a second Ann Radcliffe Award, this time for Literature, in 1969. That same year,<!-- 1969 --> Bloch was invited to the Second International Film Festival in [[Rio de Janeiro]], March 23\u201331, along with other science fiction writers from the United States, Britain and Europe.<ref>[[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]] wrote an essay, \"Report\", for ''Luna 6'', 1969, which also appeared as \"The Jos\u00e9s from Rio\" in ''Pearls From Peoria'', Subterranean Press, 2006. {{cite web |quote= The article begins as Phil and fellow scifi authors [[Alfred Bester]], [[Arthur C.

In 1972 he published another novel, ''Night-World''. In 1973 Bloch was the Guest of Honor at [[Torcon II]], [[World Science Fiction Convention]], Toronto. 1974 saw the publication of his novel ''American Gothic'', inspired by the true life story of serial killer [[H.H. Holmes]].\n\nIn 1975, Bloch won the Lifetime Achievement Award at the First [[World Fantasy Convention]] held in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. The award was a bust of H.P. Lovecraft. The occasion of this convention was the first time Bloch actually visited the city of Providence.<ref>''Time-Travelling with H. P. Lovecraft''in ''The First World Fantasy Convention: Three Authors Remember'' (West Warwick, RI: Necronomicon Press), p. 7</ref> An audio recording was made of Robert Bloch during that 1975 convention, accessible online at  [https://archive.org/details/FirstWorldFantasyConvention1975]\n\nIn 1976, two records of Bloch recordings of his stories were released by Alternate World recordings - ''Gravely, Robert Bloch!\" and ''Blood! The Life and Times of jack the Ripper!\"(with Harlan Ellison). In 1977, [[Lester del Rey]] edited ''The Best of Robert Bloch'' for Del Rey books. Two further short story collections appeared - ''Cold Chills'' and ''The King of Terrors.''\n\nBloch continued to published short story collections throughout this period. His ''Selected Stories'' (reprinted in paperback with the incorrect title ''The Complete Stories'') appeared in three volumes just prior to his death, although many previously uncollected tales have appeared in volumes published since 1997 (see below). Bloch also contributed the story \"Heir Apparent,\" set in [[Andre Norton]]'s Witch World, to ''Tales of the Witch World'' (Vol. 1), NY: Tor, 1987.\n\n1979 saw the publication of Bloch's novel ''There is a Serpent in Eden'' (also reissued as ''The Cunning''), and two more short story collections, ''Out of the Mouths of graves'' and ''Such Stuff as Screams Are Made Of.''\n\nHis numerous novels of the 1970s demonstrate Bloch's thematic range, from science fiction - ''Sneak Preview'' (1971) - through horror novels such as the loving Lovecraftian tribute ''Strange Eons'' (Whispers Press, 1978) and the non-supernatural mystery ''There is a Serpent in Eden'' (1979);\n\n===The 1980s===\nBloch's screenplay-writing career continued active through the 1980s, with teleplays for ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' (one episode, 1980), ''[[Darkroom (TV series)|Darkroom]]'' (two episodes,1981), ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985 TV series)|Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' (1 episode, 1986), ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]'' (three episodes, 1984\u201387 - \"Beetles\", \"A Case of the Stubborns\" and \"Everybody needs a Little Love\") and ''[[Monsters (TV series)|Monsters]]'' (three episodes, 1988\u20131989 - \"The Legacy\", \"Mannikins of Horror\", and \"Reaper\"). No further screen work appeared in the last five years before his death, although an adaptation of his \"collaboration\" with [[Edgar Allan Poe]], \"The Lighthouse\", was filmed as an episode of ''[[The Hunger (TV series)|The Hunger]]'' in 1998.\n\n''The First World Fantasy Convention: Three Authors Remember'' (Necronomicon Press, 1980) features reminiscences of that important event by Bloch, [[T. E. D. Klein|T.E.D. Klein]] and [[Fritz Leiber]]. In 1981, Zebra Books issued the first edition of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]-themed collection ''Mysteries of the Worm''. This item was reprinted some years later in an expanded edition by Chaosium.\n\nBloch's sequel to the original ''Psycho'' (''[[Psycho II (novel)|Psycho II]]'' was published in 1982 (unrelated to the film of the same title) and in 1983 he novelised ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]''. His novel ''[[Night of the Ripper]]'' (1984), was another return to one of Bloch's favourite themes, the Jack the Ripper murders of 1888.\n\nIn 1986, Scream Press published the hardcover omnibus ''Unholy Trinity'', collecting three by now scarce Bloch novels, ''The Scarf'', ''The Dead Beat'' and ''The Couch.'' A second retrospective selection of Bloch's nonfiction was published by NESFA Press as ''Out of My Head.''\n\nIn 1987,  Bloch celebrated his 70th birthday. Underwood-Miller issued the three-volume hardcover set ''The Selected Stories of Robert Bloch'' (individual volumes titled ''Final reckonings'', ''Bitter Ends'' and ''Last Rites''). When Citadel press reissued this in paperback they incorrectly named it ''The Collected Stories of Robert Bloch.'' The same year a collection, ''Midnight Pleasures'' appeared from Doubleday, and ''Lost in Time and Space with Lefty Feep'' (Creatures at Large Press) collected a number of the stories on the Lefty Feep series. The latter was the first of a projected series of three volumes, however the further volumes were never published. In 1988, Tor Books reissued Bloch's scarce second novel, ''The Kidnapper.'\n\nIn 1989, several works were published: the collection, ''Fear and Trembling'', the thriller novel ''Lori'' (later adapted as a standalone graphic novel) and another omnibus of long out-of-print early novels, ''Screams'' (containing ''The Will to Kill'', ''Firebug'' and ''The Star Stalker''). Randall D. Larson issued ''The Robert Bloch Companion: Collected Interviews 1969-1986'' (Starmont House), together with ''Robert Bloch'' (Starmont Reader's Guide No 37), an exhaustive study of Bloch's work, and ''The Complete Robert Bloch: An Illustrated, Comprehensive Bibliography'' (Fandom Unlimited Enterprises). Larson's three books were bound in hardcover and distributed by Borgo Press.\n\n===The 1990s: Last works===\nBloch's novel, ''The Jekyll Legacy'' (1990), was a collaboration with [[Andre Norton]] and a sequel to [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''.  The same year he returned to the Norman Bates \"mythos\" with ''Psycho House'' (Tor), the third Psycho novel. As with the second novel in the sequence, it bears no relation to the film titled ''Psycho III''. It would prove to be his last published novel.\n\nIn February 1991, he was given the Honor of Master of Ceremonies at the first [[World Horror Convention]] held in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Weird Tales issued a special Robert Bloch issue in Spring, including his screenplay for the televised version of his tale \"Beetles\"\". A standalone chapbook of the story \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" was issued in both hardcover and paperback by Pulphouse, and Bloch co-edited with [[Martin H. Greenberg]] the original anthology ''Psycho-Paths'' (Tor). In 1991 Bloch contributed an Introduction to ''In Search of Lovecraft'' by [[J. Vernon Shea]].\n\nIn 1992, Bloch celebrated his 75th birthday with a bash at a Los Angeles mystery/horror bookstore which was attended by many sf/horror notables. In 1993, he published his \"unauthorized autobiography\", ''Once Around the Bloch'' (Tor) and edited the original anthology ''Monsters in Our Midst''.\n\nIn early 1994, Fedogan and Bremer published a collection of 39 of his stories, ''The Early Fears''. Bloch began editing a new original anthology, ''Robert Bloch's Psychos'' but was unable to complete work on it prior to his death; Martin H. Greenberg finished the work posthumously and the book appeared several years later (1997).\n\n==Personal life==\nOn October 2, 1940, Bloch married Marion Ruth Holcombe; it was reportedly a marriage of convenience designed to keep Bloch out of the army.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|p=158}}</ref> During their marriage, she suffered (initially undiagnosed) [[tuberculosis]] of the bone, which affected her ability to walk.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|pp=215\u2013217}}</ref>\n\nAfter working for 11 years for the Gustav Marx Advertising Agency in Milwaukee, Bloch left in 1953 and moved to [[Weyauwega, Wisconsin|Weyauwega]], Marion's home town, so she could be close to friends and family. Although she was eventually cured of tuberculosis, she and Bloch divorced in 1963. Bloch's daughter Sally (born 1943) elected to stay with him.\n\nOn January 18, 1964, Bloch met recently widowed Eleanor (\"Elly\") Alexander (n\u00e9e Zalisko) \u2014 who had lost her first husband, writer/producer John Alexander, to a heart attack three months earlier \u2014 and made her his second wife in a civil ceremony on the following October 16. Elly was a fashion model and cosmetician.<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|pp=308\u2013309}}</ref> They honeymooned in [[Tahiti]], and in 1965 visited London, then [[British Columbia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bloch|1993|pp=304\u2013313}}</ref> They remained happily married until Bloch's death. Elly remained in the Los Angeles area for several years after selling their Laurel Canyon Home to fans of Bloch, eventually choosing to go home to Canada to be closer to her own family. She died March 7, 2007, at the Betel Home in [[Selkirk, Manitoba]], Canada.  Her ashes have been placed next to Bloch's in a similar book-shaped urn at Pierce Brothers in Westwood, California.\n\nBloch died on 23 September 1994 after a long battle with cancer, at the age of 77.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rbloch.htm |title=Robert Bloch |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604230952/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rbloch.htm |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Robert Bloch on Poe and Lovecraft\">{{cite web|url=http://alangullette.com/lit/hpl/bloch.htm|title=Robert Bloch on Poe and Lovecraft|author=|date=|website=alangullette.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tabula-rasa.info/DarkAges/RobertBloch.html|title=Robert Bloch|author=|date=|website=www.tabula-rasa.info}}</ref> in Los Angeles after a writing career lasting 60 years, including more than 30 years in television and film.
