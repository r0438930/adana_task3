It is the fourth installment in the [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' film franchise]] and the sequel to ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (2007). The film was directed by [[Mike Mitchell (director)|Mike Mitchell]] from a screenplay by [[Josh Klausner]] and [[Darren Lemke]], and stars [[Mike Myers]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Antonio Banderas]], [[Julie Andrews]], and [[John Cleese]] reprising their previous roles, with [[Walt Dohrn]] introduced in the role of [[Rumpelstiltskin]]. The plot follows [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] struggling as a family man with no privacy, who yearns for the days when he was once feared. He is tricked by Rumpelstiltskin into signing a contract that allows him to relive his golden age, but comes to realize that it comes alongside disastrous consequences.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on April 21, 2010, and was theatrically released in the [[United States]] on May 21, 2010 in [[3D film|3D]] and [[IMAX#IMAX 3D|IMAX 3D]] formats. The film debuted as the top-grossing film at the box office, a position it held for three consecutive weeks in the United States and Canada. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but many had considered it an improvement over its predecessor. The film grossed a worldwide total of $752&nbsp;million and becoming the [[2010 in film|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2010]]. In addition, ''Shrek Forever After'' became DreamWorks Animation's second-highest-grossing film at the foreign box office.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heath|first=Paul|url=http://www.thehollywoodnews.com/2010/09/07/shrek-forever-after-becomes-dreamworks-animations-biggest-release/|title=Shrek Forever After becomes Dreamworks Animation's biggest release|publisher=The Hollywood News|date=September 7, 2010}}</ref> Although originally marketed as the final installment in the film franchise, a [[Shrek Forever After#Possible sequels|fifth ''Shrek'' film]] has been reported to be in production in the years since ''Forever After'' was released.<ref name=\"Sequel-HollywoodReporter\" /><ref name=\"Shrek5\">{{cite web|last1=O'Connell|first1=Sean|title=When Shrek 5 Could Hit Theaters, According To Eddie Murphy|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1556529/when-shrek-5-could-hit-theaters-according-to-eddie-murphy|publisher=Cinemablend|accessdate=September 17, 2016|date=September 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--\n\nPer WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words.\n \n-->\nIn a flashback, King Harold and Queen Lillian are about to sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to [[Rumpelstiltskin|\"Rumpel\" Rumpelstiltskin]],  in exchange for lifting their daughter's curse. The deal is canceled at the last second when a knight informs the King and Queen that [[Princess Fiona]] has been rescued by [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]. An angry Rumpelstiltskin laments his loss and wishes Shrek was never born.\n\nIn the present time, Shrek has grown steadily weary of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers, leading him to wish for when he felt like a \"real ogre\" again. When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, an escalating series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger.\n\nShrek encounters Rumpel, who gives his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for him to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to \"thank\" him. Shrek was tricked by Rumpelstiltskin into signing the contract and suddenly was taken to an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate reality]] where the events starting from [[Shrek|the first film ]] never happened. Now feared by the villagers, Shrek takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he learns that Fiona is a fugitive, and his swamp is deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by [[Witchcraft|witches]] and taken to Rumpel, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict.\n\nRumpel reveals that he erased the day that Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek does not exist, and the King and Queen signed their kingdom over to Rumpelstiltskin, making them disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well. Shrek escapes Rumpel's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by \"true love's kiss\".\n\nThey soon encounter an army of ogres who are resisting Rumpel, led by a still-cursed Fiona, who keeps [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] as a lazy, overweight pet. Shrek does everything he can to gain Fiona's love, but she is cynical and disillusioned about the power of true love after no one came to rescue her and is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpel. While sparring with her, Fiona begins to take a liking to Shrek but stops short of kissing him. Puss encourages him to continue pursuing Fiona.\n\nDuring the ambush, the ogres are captured by the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]], though Shrek and Fiona escape with the intervention of Puss and Donkey. Shrek insists Fiona kiss him, saying it will fix everything, but it does not work because Fiona does not truly love him. When he hears that Rumpel is offering a wish to the one who brings him Shrek, Shrek turns himself in and uses the wish to free the other ogres, who storm the castle, battle the witches, and capture Rumpel.\n\nAs the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses Shrek just before he disappears. As she does not transform in the sunlight, she realizes that her kiss with Shrek has broken her curse as she has assumed \"love's true form\". The alternate reality disintegrates and everyone else disappears as Rumpel is then attacked by vengeful spirits.\n\nShrek finds himself back at his children's birthday party at the time right before he lost his temper. Instead of lashing out, Shrek embraces everyone with a newfound appreciation for family and friends.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Rumpel is arrested by the villagers and is put in a cage by them as punishment.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2/3|total_width=320\n| image1 = Mike Myers David Shankbone 2010 NYC.jpg|width1=930|height1=1203\n| image2 = Eddie Murphy Tribeca Shankbone 2010 NYC

He is tricked by Rumpelstiltskin into signing a contract that allows him to relive his golden age, but comes to realize that it comes alongside disastrous consequences.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on April 21, 2010, and was theatrically released in the [[United States]] on May 21, 2010 in [[3D film|3D]] and [[IMAX#IMAX 3D|IMAX 3D]] formats. The film debuted as the top-grossing film at the box office, a position it held for three consecutive weeks in the United States and Canada. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but many had considered it an improvement over its predecessor. The film grossed a worldwide total of $752&nbsp;million and becoming the [[2010 in film|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2010]]. In addition, ''Shrek Forever After'' became DreamWorks Animation's second-highest-grossing film at the foreign box office.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heath|first=Paul|url=http://www.thehollywoodnews.com/2010/09/07/shrek-forever-after-becomes-dreamworks-animations-biggest-release/|title=Shrek Forever After becomes Dreamworks Animation's biggest release|publisher=The Hollywood News|date=September 7, 2010}}</ref> Although originally marketed as the final installment in the film franchise, a [[Shrek Forever After#Possible sequels|fifth ''Shrek'' film]] has been reported to be in production in the years since ''Forever After'' was released.<ref name=\"Sequel-HollywoodReporter\" /><ref name=\"Shrek5\">{{cite web|last1=O'Connell|first1=Sean|title=When Shrek 5 Could Hit Theaters, According To Eddie Murphy|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1556529/when-shrek-5-could-hit-theaters-according-to-eddie-murphy|publisher=Cinemablend|accessdate=September 17, 2016|date=September 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--\n\nPer WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words.\n \n-->\nIn a flashback, King Harold and Queen Lillian are about to sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to [[Rumpelstiltskin|\"Rumpel\" Rumpelstiltskin]],  in exchange for lifting their daughter's curse. The deal is canceled at the last second when a knight informs the King and Queen that [[Princess Fiona]] has been rescued by [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]. An angry Rumpelstiltskin laments his loss and wishes Shrek was never born.\n\nIn the present time, Shrek has grown steadily weary of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers, leading him to wish for when he felt like a \"real ogre\" again. When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, an escalating series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger.\n\nShrek encounters Rumpel, who gives his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for him to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to \"thank\" him. Shrek was tricked by Rumpelstiltskin into signing the contract and suddenly was taken to an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate reality]] where the events starting from [[Shrek|the first film ]] never happened. Now feared by the villagers, Shrek takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he learns that Fiona is a fugitive, and his swamp is deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by [[Witchcraft|witches]] and taken to Rumpel, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict.\n\nRumpel reveals that he erased the day that Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek does not exist, and the King and Queen signed their kingdom over to Rumpelstiltskin, making them disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well. Shrek escapes Rumpel's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by \"true love's kiss\".\n\nThey soon encounter an army of ogres who are resisting Rumpel, led by a still-cursed Fiona, who keeps [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] as a lazy, overweight pet. Shrek does everything he can to gain Fiona's love, but she is cynical and disillusioned about the power of true love after no one came to rescue her and is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpel. While sparring with her, Fiona begins to take a liking to Shrek but stops short of kissing him. Puss encourages him to continue pursuing Fiona.\n\nDuring the ambush, the ogres are captured by the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]], though Shrek and Fiona escape with the intervention of Puss and Donkey. Shrek insists Fiona kiss him, saying it will fix everything, but it does not work because Fiona does not truly love him. When he hears that Rumpel is offering a wish to the one who brings him Shrek, Shrek turns himself in and uses the wish to free the other ogres, who storm the castle, battle the witches, and capture Rumpel.\n\nAs the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses Shrek just before he disappears. As she does not transform in the sunlight, she realizes that her kiss with Shrek has broken her curse as she has assumed \"love's true form\". The alternate reality disintegrates and everyone else disappears as Rumpel is then attacked by vengeful spirits.\n\nShrek finds himself back at his children's birthday party at the time right before he lost his temper. Instead of lashing out, Shrek embraces everyone with a newfound appreciation for family and friends.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Rumpel is arrested by the villagers and is put in a cage by them as punishment.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2/3|total_width=320\n| image1 = Mike Myers David Shankbone 2010 NYC.jpg|width1=930|height1=1203\n| image2 = Eddie Murphy Tribeca Shankbone 2010 NYC
