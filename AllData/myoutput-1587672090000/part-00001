It initially starred [[Jon Pertwee]] (who had played the [[Third Doctor]] in the series) as [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]. On 29 April Pertwee was ill, so understudy [[David Banks (actor)|David Banks]], who portrayed the [[Cyberman|Cyber Leader]] in the series from ''[[Earthshock]]'' onwards, played the Doctor for the matinee and evening performances. Pertwee continued in the role until 3 June and two days later [[Colin Baker]], who had played the [[Sixth Doctor]], took over the lead until the run ended on 19 August. The play was adjusted accordingly to conform with the Sixth Doctor's persona.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe story involves an alliance between the [[Dalek]]s and the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] who have joined forces to kidnap the American Envoy and ruin a peace conference on Earth. The Doctor's companion is a Frenchman named [[List of Doctor Who spin-off companions#Jason|Jason]]. After failing to stop the Cybermen from taking the US Envoy from a nightclub, they are joined by a singer named [[List of Doctor Who spin-off companions#Crystal|Crystal]], who works there. Following a trip to Altair Three and then the Bar Galactica, they meet Madame Delilah but are forced to flee along with a small furry creature called [[List of Doctor Who spin-off companions#Zog|Zog]].\n\nThe time travellers are captured briefly by the Daleks and navigate their ship through an asteroid field before making a series of short trips, arriving finally to confront the [[Dalek variants#Dalek Emperor|Dalek Emperor]]. The Doctor tricks the Emperor into revealing that the Daleks intend to betray the Cybermen and a battle breaks out between the two. Returning to Earth, the Doctor realises the US Envoy is under Dalek influence and programmed to destroy London with a [[Fictional elements, materials, isotopes and atomic particles#Fictional elements and materials|Dalekanium]] bomb. The Doctor breaks his conditioning and defuses the bomb by putting it in a teapot.\n\nThe play featured a female [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] named in the script 'Mrs. T' (a reference to [[Margaret Thatcher]]). The Third Doctor addresses her as Margaret in the play whilst the Sixth Doctor addresses her as Maggie. The Third Doctor also mentions Denis, a reference to [[Denis Thatcher]], Margaret Thatcher's husband. The play also features some musical numbers, including two from Crystal and \"Business is Business\" from Madam Delilah, the title of which acted as a catchphrase running throughout the play.\n\n==Cast<ref name=\"Ultimate Adventure Cast\" >{{cite web |url=http://www.theultimateadventure.co.uk/cast-ultimate-adventure.html |title=The Ultimate Adventure Cast and Crew |year=1989 |accessdate=3 April 2015 |website=The Ultimate Adventure \u2013 Doctor Who Stageplay |publisher=theultimateadventure.co.uk }}</ref>==\n[[Image:Ultimate Adventure Baker.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Advertisement for the play during the time Colin Baker starred as the Doctor.]]\n*[[Jon Pertwee]] / [[David Banks (actor)|David Banks]] / [[Colin Baker]] as The Doctor\n*Graeme Smith as Jason\n*David Bingham as Jason / MC / Vervoid / Dalek / Execution victim / French man\n*Rebeca Thornhill as Crystal\n*Judith Hibbert as Delilah / Mrs T / French woman\n*[[David Banks (actor)|David Banks]] as Karl\n*Wolf Christian as Cyber Leader / Draconian / Duelling guard / Customer\n*Troy Webb as Emperor Dalek / U.S. bodyguard / Dalek / Insect-Man / Martial arts mercenary / French man / Customer\n*Chris Beaumont as U.S. Envoy / Dalek Scientist / Hairy alien / French man\n*Claudia Kelly as Envoy's Wife / Ant-Person / Insect-Man / Ragamuffin / Customer\n*Oliver Gray as MC / Dalek / Cyberman / Mercenary / Duelling guard / French man / Customer\n*Stephanie Colburn as Zog / Bell Boy\n*Deborah Hecht as Dalek / U.S. bodyguard / Waitress / French woman\n*[[Terry Walsh (actor)|Terry Walsh]] as Mercenary / Duelling guard\n*Alison Reddihough as Mercenary / Insect-Man / Executioner / Customer\n*Gavin Warwick as Dalek / Cyberman / Vervoid / Mercenary / Execution victim / French man / Customer\n*Paula Tappenden, as Chief Dalek / Cyberman / Chicken-headed alien / French woman / Customer\n*Chris Beaumont, Troy Webb - Dalek voices\n*Oliver Gray - Cyberman Voices\n\n==Production==\nThe script featured numerous ''Doctor Who'' in-jokes, including Jon Pertwee's line [[Third Doctor#\"Reverse the polarity\"|\"reverse the polarity of the neutron flow\"]] and his singing of the Venusian Lullaby. The story also required a Dalek casing to be borrowed by one of the heroes to fool the Daleks, a ploy used in television stories ''[[The Daleks]]'' (1963) and ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'' (1973).

They also had larger rectangular dome lights, no discs along the eye stalks and no shoulder slats as were present on post-1966 Daleks. The Dalek Emperor prop was a faithful reproduction of the model that appeared in ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'' (1967).\n\nThe [[TARDIS]] set was also different, featuring roundels in a square rather than a hexagonal grid and a miniature console in which the central column was retracted completely out of view. The Cybermen costumes were identical to those used in ''[[Attack of the Cybermen]]'' (1985).\n\nWhen Colin Baker took over as the Doctor, he was provided with a redesigned version of his [[Sixth Doctor]] costume by the production crew.
