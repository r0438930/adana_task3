C&nbsp;14.01), is a work thought to be by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] for oboe, clarinet, horn, bassoon, and orchestra. He originally wrote a work for flute, oboe, horn, bassoon, and orchestra, K.&nbsp;Anh. 9 (297B), in Paris in April 1778 for performance at the  [[concert spirituel]]. Mozart wrote to his father about the composition naming the four virtuoso soloists who were to play.  However at the last minute Mozart's piece was displaced from the concert program by a piece for similar forces by [[Giuseppe Cambini]] and the Mozart work was never played. <ref>[[Robert Levin (musicologist)|Robert Levin]], ''Who Wrote the Mozart Four-Wind Concertante?'' Pp.&nbsp;1\u201366 {{ISBN|0-918728-33-9}}</ref>. This original work is now lost.\n\nThe work as it is performed today came to light in 1869 as an anonymous copy manuscript in the collection of [[Otto Jahn]]. Jahn wrote the first scholarly biography of Mozart <ref>[[Otto Jahn]], ''Life of Mozart \u2013 tr P. D. Townsend Cooper Square Publishers Inc'' {{ISBN|9781108064859}} </ref> and had amassed a large quantity of Mozart letters, original manuscripts and score copies.

Pp.&nbsp;16\u201317 {{ISBN|0-918728-33-9}}</ref>There is considerable debate about the relation of this work as it is performed today to the lost original work, in part because the Jahn score has a different lineup of soloists from the lost Mozart work, but also because it contains errors both of copying and composition.\n\n==Instrumentation==\nThe [[Sinfonia Concertante]] is scored for solo [[oboe]], solo [[clarinet]], solo [[French horn|horn]], solo [[bassoon]], and an [[Orchestra#Classical orchestra|orchestra]] of two horns, two oboes, and [[String section|strings]].
