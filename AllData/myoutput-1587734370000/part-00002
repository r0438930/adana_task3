The ''Star of the West'' was replaced with the ''[[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed News]]'' in 1924 and supplemented by the magazine ''[[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed literature#Scholarly|World Order]]'' in 1935. The first National Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1925 after years of increasing organizational development. See [[Statistics on National Spiritual Assemblies]]. Individuals in a number of social situations joined the religion - [[Alain LeRoy Locke]], [[James Ferdinand Morton Jr.]], [[Robert Sengstacke Abbott]], [[Helen Elsie Austin]], and [[Nancy Douglas Bowditch]]. Additionally, two more institutions were established like Green Acre: the Geyserville school that later moved to become the [[Bosch Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed School]] and the [[Louhelen Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed School]].\n\n===Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Historical Record Survey===\nThe [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Historical Record Survey]] was an early demographic review of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in the United States and Canada done circa 1934-1936. The backgrounds of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were later studied in a number of ways - racial and ethnic heritage, previous religious background, geographical spread and sometimes how these have changed over the years. Complimentary data sources have also been used to add to some of the reviews including US Census publications and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed directories published in periodicals of [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed literature]]. \n\nA couple of these studies look specifically at the burgeoning black population of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds amidst the wider society practice of continuing [[Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States#New_Deal_era|era of social segregation in the American society of the time]] which was against the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed teaching of the [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of all humanity]]. The vast majority of the Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were white and mostly elder women, but the black segment of those states Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were in responded more to the religion than the white population of those states did. The religion was also initially attracting Protestants, especially Unitarian Universalists and also among other more mainstream liberal denominations, but as history approached 1936 and beyond it attracted a greater diversity of religious backgrounds as it continued to grow more by conversion than by migration or birth.\n\n===First Seven Year Plan===\n[[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion after the death of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, wrote a [[Telegraphy|cable]] on May 1, 1936 to the [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed administration#National|Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Annual Convention]] of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's vision to begin.<ref name=\"alamb\">{{cite book |last=Lamb |first=Artemus |title=The Beginnings of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition |publisher=M L VanOrman Enterprises |date=November 1995 |location=West Linn, Oregon |url=http://bahai-library.com/lamb_bahai_latin_america}}</ref> In his cable he wrote:\n<blockquote>\nAppeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in ''Tablets of the Divine Plan''.

The first mention in relation to the history of the religion came in the 1860s in a newspaper article. Following this the first individual from South Carolina to find the religion was [[Louis Gregory]] in 1909, followed by individuals inside the state. Communities of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds were soon operating in [[North Augusta, South Carolina|North Augusta]], [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] and [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]] struggled with segregation culture through the 1950s externally and internally. However, in the 1969-1973 period, a very remarkable and somewhat unsustainable period of conversions to the religion on the basis of a meeting of Christian and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed religious ideas established a basis of community across several counties - notably [[Marion County, South Carolina|Marion]], [[Williamsburg County, South Carolina|Williamsburg]], and [[Dillon County, South Carolina|Dillon]], served by the [[Louis Gregory Institute]] and its radio station [[WLGI]] but also across the wider area. That community continues and has gathered news coverage as part of the second largest religion in South Carolina.\n\n===Alaska===\n{{Main|Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in Alaska}}\nAlaska is unusual in that it is not an independent nation, recognized by the United Nations, and yet has a National Spiritual Assembly.  Its specific statistics are not published, and are often not broken out in non-Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed statistics of the USA in general.  There are currently about 1500 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Alaska.\n\n===Hawai'i===\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community in Hawai'i had its origins when Hawaiian-born [[Agnes Alexander]], who became a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed in Paris in 1900, returned to the islands in 1901. Similar to Alaska, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds of Hawai'i have an independent National Spiritual Assembly from that of the USA, though it is itself one of the 50 United States. Independent statistics have not been published.\n\n==Notable American Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds==\n{{See also|List of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds}}\nOutside the religion in general society prominent Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds have been social and civic leaders [[Alain LeRoy Locke]], [[Patricia Locke]], [[Dorothy Wright Nelson]] and [[Layli Miller-Muro]], entertainers [[Seals and Crofts]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[Andy Grammar]] and among academics [[Suheil Bushrui]], and [[Dwight W.

This guidance took the form of a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]''.

The ''Star of the West'' was replaced with the ''[[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed News]]'' in 1924 and supplemented by the magazine ''[[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed literature#Scholarly|World Order]]'' in 1935. The first National Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1925 after years of increasing organizational development. See [[Statistics on National Spiritual Assemblies]]. Individuals in a number of social situations joined the religion - [[Alain LeRoy Locke]], [[James Ferdinand Morton Jr.]], [[Robert Sengstacke Abbott]], [[Helen Elsie Austin]], and [[Nancy Douglas Bowditch]]. Additionally, two more institutions were established like Green Acre: the Geyserville school that later moved to become the [[Bosch Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed School]] and the [[Louhelen Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed School]].\n\n===Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Historical Record Survey===\nA [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Historical Record Survey]] was an early demographic review of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in the  United States and Canada done circa 1934-1936. The backgrounds of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were later studied in a number of ways - racial and ethnic heritage, previous religious background, geographical spread and sometimes how these have changed over the years. Complimentary data sources have also been used to add to some of the reviews including US Census publications and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed directories published in periodicals of [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed literature]]. \n\nA couple of these studies look specifically at the burgeoning black population of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds amidst the wider society practice of continuing [[Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States#New_Deal_era|era of social segregation in the American society of the time]] which was against the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed teaching of the [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of all humanity]]. The vast majority of the Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were white and mostly elder women, but the black segment of those states Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were in responded more to the religion than the white population of those states did. The religion was also initially attracting Protestants, especially Unitarian Universalists and also among other more mainstream liberal denominations, but as history approached 1936 and beyond it attracted a greater diversity of religious backgrounds as it continued to grow more by conversion than by migration or birth.\n\n===First Seven Year Plan===\n[[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion after the death of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, wrote a [[Telegraphy|cable]] on May 1, 1936 to the [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed administration#National|Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Annual Convention]] of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's vision to begin.<ref name=\"alamb\">{{cite book |last=Lamb |first=Artemus |title=The Beginnings of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition |publisher=M L VanOrman Enterprises |date=November 1995 |location=West Linn, Oregon |url=http://bahai-library.com/lamb_bahai_latin_america}}</ref> In his cable he wrote:\n<blockquote>\nAppeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in ''Tablets of the Divine Plan''.

The first mention in relation to the history of the religion came in the 1860s in a newspaper article. Following this the first individual from South Carolina to find the religion was [[Louis Gregory]] in 1909, followed by individuals inside the state. Communities of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds were soon operating in [[North Augusta, South Carolina|North Augusta]], [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] and [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]] struggled with segregation culture through the 1950s externally and internally. However, in the 1969-1973 period, a very remarkable and somewhat unsustainable period of conversions to the religion on the basis of a meeting of Christian and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed religious ideas established a basis of community across several counties - notably [[Marion County, South Carolina|Marion]], [[Williamsburg County, South Carolina|Williamsburg]], and [[Dillon County, South Carolina|Dillon]], served by the [[Louis Gregory Institute]] and its radio station [[WLGI]] but also across the wider area. That community continues and has gathered news coverage as part of the second largest religion in South Carolina.\n\n===Alaska===\n{{Main|Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in Alaska}}\nAlaska is unusual in that it is not an independent nation, recognized by the United Nations, and yet has a National Spiritual Assembly.  Its specific statistics are not published, and are often not broken out in non-Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed statistics of the USA in general.  There are currently about 1500 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Alaska.\n\n===Hawai'i===\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community in Hawai'i had its origins when Hawaiian-born [[Agnes Alexander]], who became a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed in Paris in 1900, returned to the islands in 1901. Similar to Alaska, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds of Hawai'i have an independent National Spiritual Assembly from that of the USA, though it is itself one of the 50 United States. Independent statistics have not been published.\n\n==Notable American Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds==\n{{See also|List of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds}}\nOutside the religion in general society prominent Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds have been social and civic leaders [[Alain LeRoy Locke]], [[Patricia Locke]], [[Dorothy Wright Nelson]] and [[Layli Miller-Muro]], entertainers [[Seals and Crofts]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[Andy Grammar]] and among academics [[Suheil Bushrui]], and [[Dwight W.
