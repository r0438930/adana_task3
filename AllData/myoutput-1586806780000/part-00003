{"title_page": "2006 Faroe Islands Premier League", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=February 2018}}\n[[Faroe Islands Premier League Football]] in the 2006 season.\n\n[[EB/Streymur]] were top of the league throughout most of the season, with [[Havnar B\u00f3ltfelag|HB T\u00f3rshavn]], [[B36 T\u00f3rshavn]] and [[NS\u00cd Runav\u00edk]] staying in contention. With 4 matches left to play, EB/Streymur were 7 points ahead of second placed HB, but after 1 draw and 1 loss for EB/Streymur, HB managed to reduce that lead by 2 points by winning twice. By this time B36, K\u00cd and NS\u00cd were out of the title race. With one match left to play, HB T\u00f3rshavn's only chance of securing the title was if EB/Streymur lost to [[K\u00cd Klaksv\u00edk]]. In addition to that, HB had to win their match against [[\u00cdF]]. But as both matches were locked in stalemates and time was ebbing out, EB/Streymur were on the way to winning the title. \nBut then, 82 minutes into the match between EB/Streymur and K\u00cd, events took a dramatic twist, as Paul Clapson put K\u00cd 1-0 up against EB/Streymur with a long range effort. But EB/Streymur were still champions at this stage, because HB didn't seem to be able to capitalize on the golden opportunity given by EB/Streymur and K\u00cd. \n\n88 minutes had gone in the match between HB and \u00cdF, and still HB hadn't scored the crucial goal that would hand them the title. But in a last desperate effort, HB's central defender [[Vagnur Mohr Mortensen]] joined the attack. A long high ball was sent into \u00cdF's penalty area on the left where Vagnur headed the ball over a stranded goalkeeper and into the goal for a 1-0 lead and, more importantly, secured HB the 2006 championship title. Deep into stoppage time, [[R\u00f3gvi Jacobsen]] added another and HB won 2-0.\n\n==League table==\n{{#invoke:sports table|main|style=WDL\n|res_col_header=QR\n\n|team1=HB|name_HB=[[Havnar B\u00f3ltfelag|HB]]\n|team2=EBS|name_EBS=[[EB/Streymur]]\n|team3=B36|name_B36=[[B36 T\u00f3rshavn]]\n|team4=K\u00cd|name_K\u00cd=[[K\u00cd Klaksv\u00edk|K\u00cd]]\n|team5=NS\u00cd|name_NS\u00cd=[[NS\u00cd Runav\u00edk]]\n|team6=G\u00cdG|name_G\u00cdG=[[G\u00cd G\u00f8ta]]\n|team7=SK\u00c1|name_SK\u00c1=[[Sk\u00e1la IF]]\n|team8=VBV|name_VBV=[[VB V\u00e1gur]]\n|team9=B68|name_B68=[[B68 Toftir]]\n|team10=\u00cdF|name_\u00cdF=[[\u00cdF Fuglafj\u00f8r\u00f0ur|\u00cdF]]\n|win_HB=16|draw_HB=7|loss_HB=4|gf_HB=61|ga_HB=36|status_HB=C\n|win_EBS=16|draw_EBS=6|loss_EBS=5|gf_EBS=63|ga_EBS=30\n|win_B36=13|draw_B36=8|loss_B36=6|gf_B36=45|ga_B36=32\n|win_K\u00cd=12|draw_K\u00cd=9|loss_K\u00cd=6|gf_K\u00cd=54|ga_K\u00cd=39\n|win_NS\u00cd=12|draw_NS\u00cd=6|loss_NS\u00cd=9|gf_NS\u00cd=50|ga_NS\u00cd=39\n|win_G\u00cdG=10|draw_G\u00cdG=11|loss_G\u00cdG=6|gf_G\u00cdG=39|ga_G\u00cdG=34\n|win_SK\u00c1=7|draw_SK\u00c1=10|loss_SK\u00c1=10|gf_SK\u00c1=33|ga_SK\u00c1=29\n|win_VBV=5|draw_VBV=5|loss_VBV=17|gf_VBV=24|ga_VBV=73\n|win_B68=4|draw_B68=6|loss_B68=17|gf_B68=34|ga_B68=58|status_B68=R\n|win_\u00cdF=4|draw_\u00cdF=4|loss_\u00cdF=19|gf_\u00cdF=29|ga_\u00cdF=62|status_\u00cdF=R\n|col_CL1=#ACE1AF|text_CL1=[[2007\u201308 UEFA Champions League#First qualifying round|2007\u201308 UEFA Champions League First qualifying round]]\n|result1=CL1\n|col_UC1=#97DEFF|text_UC1=[[2007\u201308 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup 2007\u201308 First qualifying round]] \n|result2=UC1|result3=UC1\n|col_IC1=#BBEBFF|text_IC1=[[2007 UEFA Intertoto Cup|UEFA Intertoto Cup 2007 First round]]\n|result4=IC1\n|col_R=#FF8888|text_R=Relegation to [[1. deild]]\n|result9=R|result10=R\n\n|update=complete|source=\n|class_rules=1st points, 2nd head-to-head, 3rd goals average\n}}\n\n== Top goalscorers ==\n; 18 goals\n* {{flagicon|FRO}} [[Christian H\u00f8gni Jacobsen]] (NSI)<ref>[http://www.faroesoccer.com/content.php?pid=792 Faroesoccer.com] (chose 2006 and \"OK\", then chose \"M\u00e1l\" which means goals)</ref>\n\n;15 goals\n* {{flagicon|FRO}} [[S\u00fani Fr\u00ed\u00f0i Barb\u00e1]] (B68)\n\n; 12 goals\n\n* {{flagicon|ENG}} Paul Clapson (KI)\n* {{flagicon|FRO}} R\u00f3kur Jespersen (HB)\n* {{flagicon|FRA}} [[Amed Davy Sylla]] (B36)\n\n;11 goals\n\n* {{flagicon|FRO}} [[Arnbj\u00f8rn Hansen]] (EB/Steymur)\n* {{flagicon|DEN}} [[Christian Lundberg]] (KI)\n* {{flagicon|FRO}} Oli Hansen (NSI)\n* {{flagicon|ROU}} Sorin Anghel (EB/Streymur)\n\n;10 goals\n* {{flagicon|FRO}} Hans Pauli Samuelsen (EB/Streymur)\n* {{flagicon|FRO}} [[J\u00e1kup \u00e1 Borg]] (HB)\n* {{flagicon|FRO}} [[P\u00e1ll Mohr Joensen]] (HB)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Faroe Islands Premier League Football seasons}}\n{{2005\u201306 in European football (UEFA)}}\n{{2006\u201307 in European football (UEFA)}}\n\n[[Category:Faroe Islands Premier League seasons]]\n[[Category:2006 in Faroe Islands football|1]]\n[[Category:2006\u201307 in European association football leagues|Faroe]]\n[[Category:2005\u201306 in European association football leagues|Faroe]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=February 2018}}\n[[Faroe Islands Premier League Football]] in the 2006 season.\n\n[[EB/Streymur]] were top of the league throughout most of the season, with [[Havnar B\u00f3ltfelag|HB T\u00f3rshavn]], [[B36 T\u00f3rshavn]] and [[NS\u00cd Runav\u00edk]] staying in contention.
