He is also regarded as a significant figure in the history of [[cassette culture]] and [[DIY music]]. His most popular work is ''[[The Greatest Living Englishman]]'' (1993), produced by [[Andy Partridge]] of [[XTC]].\n\n==Musical career==\n\n===1973\u20131979===\nIn the summer of 1973, a 20-year-old Newell joined the glam-rock band '''Plod''' as their lead singer, replacing founder member and lead singer [[Steve Travis]] (Greenfield). Plod was signed to London-based indie label Banjul Records in early 1975, and quickly began recording tracks for an album. However, contractual irregularities and financial problems at the label prevented the album from being finished or released,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} and the band broke up within a few months of being signed. In 2003, one track from the sessions (\"Neo City\") was released on a 70s glam-rock compilation CD titled ''[[Velvet Tinmine]]''. This track was credited to ''The'' Plod, and remains the only officially issued work by the band.\n\nNewell then joined '''Gypp''', a pop-oriented progressive rock band, as lead singer. Gypp also played abroad and became popular in Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia area thanks to their live performances. Gypp issued one 3-song 7-inch EP in 1978, but their music was out of step with the punk-oriented trends of the UK music scene at the time and the EP received a negative review in the ''[[New Musical Express]].''  Demoralised, Newell left the band. By his own account, he then became a \"musical recluse\", staying in the studio and creating new songs but not playing live gigs for many years.\n\n===1979\u20131992===\nIn the late seventies, Newell led a four-piece rock combo called '''The Stray Trolleys'''. They recorded material in 1979 and 1980, but it was not released until after the band had broken up.\n\nIn the meantime, Newell issued his first solo single (\"Young Jobless\" b/w \"Sylvie in Toytown\") on vinyl in 1980. By the end of 1980, he was collaborating with Lawrence \"Lol\" Elliot as '''The Cleaners from Venus''', a band that mostly released their work on cassettes outside the traditional music distribution channels.\n\nBy 1983, The Cleaners from Venus had evolved into a band with a floating line-up that featured Newell as its only constant. The band still primarily issued material on cassette, got signed to the West German independent label Modell Records for one vinyl album (''Under Wartime Conditions'') and ultimately to the German leg of [[RCA]] Records which released two albums (''Going to England'', ''Town and Country'').\n\n[[Giles Smith]] joined Newell as the only other official member of Cleaners From Venus between 1986 and 1988, and in 1987, Newell returned to performing live under The Cleaners of<!-- Is \"of\" deliberate here, or just a typo for \"from\"? --> Venus banner. As well, while regularly releasing Cleaners From Venus material on cassette, through the 1980s Newell also occasionally released cassette singles and albums under his own name. On these solo releases he was usually the only musician.\n\nIn spring 1988 Newell and Nelson (Peter Nice) formed the [[Musical_ensemble#Two_parts|duo]] '''The Brotherhood of Lizards''', self-releasing the [[Mini-LP|mini-album]] ''The Brotherhood of Lizards'' that same year, followed by the album ''Lizardland'' released on [[Independent record label|independent label]] Deltic Records in 1989.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Newell |first1=Martin |title=Lizard Tails -- Martin Looks Back |url=http://www.stevedix.de/newell/overview.html |website=Martin Newell's website |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> To support the album the duo embarked on a [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] promotional tour, cycling over 1000 miles across southern England between October 1989 and February 1990 to make local radio appearances and and do local newspaper interviews, while also [[Street performance|busking]] and performing gigs. The uniqueness of this \"green tour\" caught the attention of the [[Media of the United Kingdom|mainstream media]] with the duo making half a dozen televison appearances, and interviews with them appeared in the [[NME]], [[Melody Maker]], [[The Guardian]], [[The Independent]], [[The Mail on Sunday]] and [[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]. On completion of the tour Nelson was recruited as the replacement bass player for the band [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]] and the Brotherhood of Lizards disbanded.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Newell |first1=Martin |title=Martin Newell's Illustrated Tour Diaries |url=http://www.stevedix.de/newell/lizarddiaries.html |website=Martin Newell's website |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |last1=Frometa |first1=RJ |title=Captured Tracks Releases Reissue Of Brotherhood of Lizards \u201cLizardland\u201d TODAY |url=https://ventsmagazine.com/2016/08/19/captured-tracks-releases-reissue-brotherhood-lizards-lizardland-today/ |website=Vents Magazine |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===1993\u2013present===\nIn 1993, Newell began working primarily as a solo artist with more conventional production values. His first non-cassette solo album, ''[[The Greatest Living Englishman]]'', was produced by [[XTC]]'s [[Andy Partridge]], and was a critical success.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Commercially, it remains his most popular and successful album.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  It was followed by three more albums (''The Off White Album'', produced by [[Louis Philippe (musician)|Louis Philippe]], ''The Spirit Cage'' and ''Radio Autumn Attic'') and an EP (''Songs from the Station Hotel'') that continued to explore the same subject matter as ''Englishman'', including the charms of rural or small-town English life and portraits of characters and scenes.\n\nNewell has also made live appearances with The Cleaners from Venus and The Stray Trolleys in the 1990s and beyond, and has issued several post-1993 live recordings with these bands. However, studio releases credited to these groups post-1993 are actually all CD reissues of pre-1993 material previously released only on cassette. In addition, Gypp played reunion gigs in 1996, and live Gypp material \u2013 as well as Gypp demos recorded in the late 1970s \u2013 have now been officially issued on CD.\n\nIn 2004 Newell released an album of light jazz songs, ''The Light Programme''. The album was not particularly successful commercially but his next album ''A Summer Tamarind'' returned to his usual style and was much more warmly received.\n\nIn late 2005 the British singer [[Richard Shelton (actor)|Richard Shelton]] released a jazz vocal album called ''Top Cat'' with five Newell compositions. Newell's songs have also been recorded by Miki Huber, The Jennifers, Kerry Getz, [[R. Stevie Moore]] and [[Alphaville (group)|Alphaville]].\n\n==Literary career==\nNewell is better known to some as a poet and author; he has released several volumes of poetry (often in collaboration with [[James Dodds]]) and a memoir, ''This Little Ziggy'', about his youth and his days in Plod. In 2007 he released a volume of reminiscences, anecdotes and historical information about his beloved Wivenhoe. He is also a weekly contributor of poetry to ''[[The Sunday Express]],'' He now writes a weekly column for the East Anglian Daily Times (for which he won columnist of the year in the EDF/ East of England Media Awards in January 2010), performs annually at the [[Essex Book Festival]] and occasionally  issues spoken word recordings of his poems.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Martin Newell discography}}\n\n'''Studio albums'''\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n*''Barricades and Angels'' (1980)\n*''Blow Away Your Troubles'' (1981)\n*''On Any Normal Monday'' (1982)\n*''Midnight Cleaners'' (1982)\n*''In the Golden Autumn'' (1983)\n*''[[Under Wartime Conditions]]'' (1984)\n*''Songs for a Fallow Land'' (1985)\n*''Living with Victoria Grey'' (1986)\n*''Going to England'' (1987)\n*''Town & Country'' (1988)\n*''The Brotherhood of Lizards'' (1988)\n*''Lizardland'' (1989)\n*''Number Thirteen'' (1990)\n*''[[The Greatest Living Englishman]]'' (1993)\n*''The Off White Album'' (1995)\n*''The Spirit Cage'' (2000)\n*''Radio Autumn Attic'' (2002)\n*''The Light Programme'' (2004)\n*''A Summer Tamarind'' (2007)\n*''English Electric'' (2011)\n*''In Chimp World'' (2011)\n*''The Late District'' (2013)\n*''Return to Bohemia'' (2014)\n*''Rose of the Lanes'' (2015)\n*''The Last Boy in the Locarno'' (2016)\n*''Star Cafe'' (2018)\n*''Life in a Time Machine'' (2018)\n*''Dolly Birds & Spies'' (2020)\n}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{main|Martin Newell bibliography}}\n\n'''Publications'''\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*''I Hank Marvinned...''
