The degree combines the study of global economics, history, politics and social relations with the study of languages and cultures in a rigorous multidisciplinary curriculum. \n\n <!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:croft_logo.gif|thumb|400px|right|]] -->\nIn addition to a regional focus (Latin America, Europe, Middle East, and East Asia), Croft students select a thematic concentration on one of the following: global economics and business, international governance and politics, or social and cultural identity. \n\nCroft students, more commonly known as \"Crofties\", pursue advanced proficiency in one of ten foreign languages as an integral part of their studies: Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, or Spanish. The University of Mississippi has one of the nation's top Flagship Intensive Chinese programs, sponsored by the U.S. government. <ref>[http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/modern_languages/NFLP.html Chinese - Modern Languages Department - The University of Mississippi<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Intensive Arabic program also expects students to reach levels of proficiency similar to those in a flagship program. Accelerated language programs are available in German, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. \n \nThe Croft Institute for International Studies at The University of Mississippi was established in 1997 with major financial support from the Joseph C. Bancroft Charitable & Educational Fund. The Croft Institute's first full year of operation was the academic year 1998/99. The Croft Institute offers ten Croft scholarships of $8,000 dollars for four years to entering students each year.  It also offers several other scholarships. Admission to the Institute is selective.\n\n== Director ==\n\nThe Executive Director of the Croft Institute is Dr. Oliver Dinius, a professor of modern Latin American History. His research focuses on the history of social and economic development, above all in 20th-century Brazil. He earned his Ph.D. from [[Harvard University]].\n\nDr. Will Schenck  is the Associate Director of the Croft Institute.  He received his BA in History summa cum laude from Boston College in 1999. He completed his Ph.D. in Romance Languages and Literatures at [[Boston College]] with a concentration in French and Italian Medieval Literature in 2008 and holds a Masters in French Literature and Civilization from the University of Paris III in France.\n\nDuring their free time, both directors can be found swimming in the Turner Center. \n\n== Faculty ==\n\nThere are currently 14 Croft professors with joint appointments in the departments of Anthropology, Economics, History, Modern languages, Political Science, and Sociology. Other faculty from those and other disciplines (including law and mathematics) regularly offer classes for the Croft Institute. These professors are all active researchers in their fields and have published many books and articles in their areas of specialization.\n\n== Students ==\n\nThe Croft Institute currently has 219 students (East Asia: 45, Europe: 91, Latin America: 54, Middle East: 29).  The average ACT score of the Croft student body is 31.  A group of 13 students, 3 from each cohort and one member-at-large, represent the program as the Croft Senate. The group hosts biweekly meetings, plans events (most notably, Crom), promotes philanthropy, and serves as a communication pathway between students and faculty.\n\n== Alumni ==\n\nThe majority of Croft alumni will obtain one or more graduate degrees at some point in their careers, typically a Masters or J.D., but occasionally a doctorate or even medical degree. About half of graduates work in the private sector, while the rest are split between education, the non-profit sector, and local, state, and national governments. In the private sector, they work for large public corporations, small start-ups, and everything in between, serving as managers, analysts, marketers, entrepreneurs, and more. Many of our graduates go on to study law and work as attorneys or legal counsel. In the field of education, about half of our alumni are professors, teachers and researchers, while the other half are administrators or advisors. The Croft graduates who work for non-profit organizations are involved in fields ranging from the arts, the environment, international development, and education to health care, human rights, and legal services. Many of our alumni who work in the public sector serve in our nation's military, while others work for the State Department, Congress, and other federal, state, local, or international agencies. Alumni can join an extensive alumni network upon graduation and are encouraged to offer insight to current students, whether through a mentorship program, webinars, or Croft-hosted speaking events. \n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.croft.olemiss.edu/home/ Croft Institute for International Studies website]\n* [http://olemiss.edu The University of Mississippi's website]\n\n== See also ==\n* Croft shares students and events with the [[Center for Intelligence and Security Studies]], which trains new analysts in [[Intelligence Analysis]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{University of Mississippi}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Croft Institute For International Studies}}\n[[Category:University of Mississippi]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Croft Institute University of Mississippi 2018 1.jpg|thumb|right|Croft Institute building]]\nThe '''Croft Institute for International Studies''' (or '''Croft''') offers a B.A. degree in [[international studies]] in conjunction with the [[University of Mississippi]]'s college of Liberal Arts.
