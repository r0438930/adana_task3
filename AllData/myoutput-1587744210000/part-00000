Located 5&nbsp;km (3 miles) northeast of the Olmec ceremonial center of [[La Venta]] in the Grijalva river delta section of the Tabasco Coastal Plain, San Andr\u00e9s is considered one of its elite satellite communities, with evidence of elite residences and other elite activities.

Continuously occupied over the following 550 years, San Andr\u00e9s was finally abandoned some time before 350 BCE. This date roughly coincides with the abandonment of the La Venta and the dissolution of the Olmec culture.<ref>Pohl et al. 2004, p. 18</ref>\n\n==Early traces of domesticated plants==\nSan Andr\u00e9s is notable for the ancient pollen and seeds recovered there. Although the humid rainy tropical lowlands have made quick work of organic substances, including Olmec skeletal remains, the multi-disciplinary research team delved below the [[water table]], hoping that the preservative nature of water-logged soil would enable them to retrieve ancient samples.\n\nTheir findings include:\n*Early maize (''Zea'' species) pollen from as early as 5100 BCE.\n*A single [[cassava|manioc]] pollen grain dated to roughly 4600 BCE. Since manioc pollen is rare in sediments, its discovery was either \"fortuitous, or abundant stands of manioc were growing close to the site\".\n*A domesticated sunflower seed and fruit dated to roughly 2650 BCE and 2550 BCE respectively.  This is the earliest record yet of the domesticated sunflower.\n*Cotton (''[[Gossypium]]'') pollen from roughly 2500 BCE. The researchers suggest that this cotton was domesticated, although wild cotton does occur naturally along the Gulf Coast to the east.<ref>Pope 2001</ref>\n\n==Evidence of Elite Feasting==\n\u201cIn Formative period Mesoamerica, high-status goods were significant components of cultural practice and a source of social, political, and ideological power.\u201d <ref>Pohl 2005, p. 3</ref> Seinfeld (2007) asserts that \u201cearly complex societies often used feasting as a way for individuals to gain followers and to assert their status\u201d and that this occurred at San Andres.<ref>Seinfeld 2007, p. 10</ref> This study is particularly interesting because the researchers used sound and updated methods to determine social facts concerning feasting at a site where little is conclusively known about social structures. Maize and cacao were detected due to their distinctive biomarkers including C4 signature plant carbon for maize and nitrogen containing organic compounds for cacao.<ref>Seinfeld 2007, p. 89</ref> \u201cDiscoveries include patterns of maize use suggestive of its use as an elite feasting food and beverage rather than as a dietary staple. Further results suggest possible evidence of Olmec cacao use.\u201d <ref>Seinfeld 2007, p. 10</ref> During the Middle Formative period [[Mesoamerican Feasts|feasting]] allowed the elite to demonstrate their power and enhance their status and identity, as the consumption of alcohol had ritualistic and spiritual meaning among the elites. Cocoa, maize-alcohol, and \u201celite-foods\u201d gave these gatherings special significance and provides definite proof that there was an elite class in San Andres, and, by extension, La Venta.\n\n==Didactic Miniatures== \nPohl (2005) and her colleagues found plenty of evidence to suggest that miniature representations of everyday objects were used ritualistically. \u201cThese miniatures may have been crafted with the express purpose of composing didactic or ritual reenactments of crucial mythic or conventionalized historic events much in the same fashion as La Venta Offering 4.\u201d <ref>Pohl 2005, p. 7</ref> Other elite-religious-status denoting objects (greenstone artifacts, jewelry, maskettes, iron-ore mirrors, etc.) were found at San Andres. \u201cA contextual comparison suggests that, like the La Venta prestige artifacts, the San Andr\u00e9s sumptuary items were significant components of ceremonial activity.\u201d <ref>Pohl 2005, p. 8</ref>\n\n==Indications of an Olmec writing system==\n{{Main|Olmec hieroglyphs}}\n\n[[File:Proposed Olmec glyphs (San Andres).svg|150px|thumb|San Andr\u00e9s [[Glyph (archaeology)|glyph]]s. The top set of glyphs have been interpreted as \"3 Ajaw\". The bottom two glyphs were found incised into semi-precious [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] artifacts.]]\n\nExcavations at San Andr\u00e9s in 1997 and 1998 produced three artifacts that many archaeologists contend demonstrate that the Olmec civilization used a true writing system. These artifacts, dated roughly to 650 BCE (the middle of the Olmec concentration at La Venta and San Andres), were found in a refuse dump, the remains from a festival or feast. \u201cThe fact that the artifacts with glyphs were found in the context of feasting refuse suggest that writing among the Olmec was sacred and was closely tied to ritual activities.\u201d <ref>Pohl 2005, p. 10</ref>\n\nThe most important find was a fist-sized ceramic cylinder seal, likely used to print cloth. When rolled out, the seal shows two [[speech scroll]]s emanating from a bird, followed directly by a number of design elements enframing what has been interpreted as logograms for \u201cking (sideways U shape),\u201d \"3 (three dots, according to the Mesoamerican bar and dots numbering system),\u201d and \u201cAjaw (from the sacred 260-day calendar)\", a designation used for both a calendar date and, in keeping with Mesoamerican custom, the name of an Olmec ruler.\nIn addition to the ceramic cylinder seal, two fingernail-sized fragments from a greenstone plaque have been recovered, each containing an incised glyph. Both these glyphs have been linked to well-documented glyphs in other Mesoamerican writing systems, including the Isthmian and Maya scripts.<ref>Pohl, et al. p. 1984-1985</ref>\n\nWell-known archaeologist and writer Michael D. Coe interprets these glyphs as \"an early kind of writing\" <ref>Bower 2002</ref> while Richard A. Diehl, who excavated at the Olmec site of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan with Coe, finds that this discovery \"establishes the existence of Olmec writing and calendrics by 650 B.C.E\" <ref>Diehl 2004, p. 96</ref> On the other hand, Mayanist epigrapher David Stuart stated that it would be hard to discern evidence of a writing system in a handful of symbols.<ref>Bower 2002</ref>\n\n===Cascajal Block===\nThe question of whether the Olmecs possessed a [[writing system]] was complicated in 2006 by the discovery of the [[Cascajal Block]]. This artifact, a slab of [[Serpentinite|serpentine]] with 62 incised characters, has been dated to 900 BCE, although it was discovered without [[archaeological context]]. Instead of being precursors to the San Andr\u00e9s glyphs, however, the 28 unique Cascajal block characters bear no obvious resemblance to them and are, indeed, unlike those of any other Mesoamerican writing system.<ref>Skidmore, who says \"[The Cascajal block script] apparently left no descendants, with no certain link to [[Isthmian script|Isthmian]] or other Formative [period] writing.\", p.5.</ref> Questions concerning the interpretation of the San Andr\u00e9s glyphs (and the Cascajal block) will need to await further research.\n\n==See also==\n*[[El Manat\u00ed]] - an Olmec archaeological site where, like San Andr\u00e9s, water-logged soil also preserved organic artifacts\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes}}<!--BEGIN biblio format.
