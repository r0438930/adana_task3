Arguments have been made that the college was named for [[Calvinist]] leader [[John Knox]], but it is not certain for which Knox it was named (if not both). George Candee Gale, a great-great-grandson of two of the founders, explains that\n\n<blockquote>contrary to general belief, Knox was not named for either General Knox or the Scottish Presbyterian Knox, according to my father ...Some wanted the college named for one Knox, some for the other; so they compromised on KNOX.

Arguments have been made that the college was named for [[Calvinist]] leader [[John Knox]], but it is not certain for which Knox it was named (if not both). George Candee Gale, a great-great-grandson of two of the founders, explains that\n\n<blockquote>contrary to general belief, Knox was not named for either General Knox or the Scottish Presbyterian Knox, according to my father ...Some wanted the college named for one Knox, some for the other; so they compromised on KNOX. Certainly most of them were pious enough to want the churchman and fighters enough to want the soldier as well.\"<ref>Calkins, Earnest Elmo.
