To Vima is historically the newspaper to which prominent politicians would most commonly provide interviews or write articles. [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], [[Georgios Papandreou]], [[Nikolaos Plastiras]], [[Constantine Karamanlis]] and [[Andreas Papandreou]] are among those who wrote for the newspaper.\n\n==Content==\nThe newspaper features as columnists prominent [[journalist]]s within the Greek media, including Yiannis Pretenderis and Vassilis Moulopoulos. Some of the newspaper's regular columnists include academics, university professors (such as [[Konstantinos Tsoukalas]], [[Nikos Mouzelis]], or Dimitris Psychogios, who contributes under a [[nom-de-plume]]), political scientists and a number of [[politician]]s. The Sunday edition of the newspaper used to be a staple of Greek press, while today it competes both with the centre-left ''[[Proto Thema|To Proto Thema]]'' and the high-quality conservative ''[[Kathimerini]]''. ''To Vima'', by Greek standards, is considered center-left and is politically aligned with the centrist (reformist) wing of the Greek [[social-democratic]] party [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]]. The majority of publications from within the Lambrakis Press fold are also politically aligned with the party. Some of its former editor have occupied key ministerial positions with the PASOK, such as [[Petros Efthimiou]] and Giorgos Romeos; it is also not uncommon for some of its journalists to stand for parliament, mainly with PASOK.\n\n==Circulation==\nTo Vima had a circulation of 114,035 in October 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tribune.gr/media/news/article/82769/41-ptosi-gia-vima-kiklofories-efimeridon.html | title=41% \u03c0\u03c4\u03ce\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \"\u03a4\u03bf \u0392\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\" \u2013 \u039a\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u0395\u03c6\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd | publisher=tribune.gr | date=18 October 2014 | accessdate=2 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website}} {{in lang|el}} Contains searchable index of the Sunday editions since 1996 (in Greek)]\n*[http://digital.tovima.gr/ Digital edition in PDF of the daily and the Sunday edition (in Greek).
