The band's original lineup consisted of vocalist [[Mark Hennessy]], guitarist Grant Fitch, bassist Charles Bryan, and drummer Peter Fitch. They released two studio albums \u2013 ''[[Dragline (album)|Dragline]]'' and ''[[Death to Traitors (album)|Death To Traitors]]'', the [[B-side]] and outtake collection ''[[Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself|Keep The Last Bullet For Yourself]]'' and the EP ''[[Home Is a Strange Place|Home Is A Strange Place]]'' before disbanding in 2000. On two occasions they have reunited.\n\n== History ==\nPaw was formed in 1990 in Lawrence alongside [[Kill Creek]] and Stick. Their work from this era can best be characterized as aggressive rock with melodic undertones, or '[[Southern rock]]' as Hennessy explained in an [[MTV]] interview. They were frequently cited by industry insiders as potentially \"the next [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]\" and a bidding war erupted to sign them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-01-19-ca-565-story.html|title=In Search of the Next Nirvana . . .|date=January 19, 1992|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://diffuser.fm/paw-dragline-anniversary/|title=22 Years Ago: Paw Make Their Debut With 'Dragline'|first=James|last=Stafford|website=Diffuser.fm}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=yqmlNOuYQdEC&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=paw+next+nirvana#v=onepage&q=paw%20next%20nirvana&f=false |title = SPIN|date = May 2010}}</ref> The band signed a three-album deal with [[A&M Records]] during the height of the [[grunge]] wave, and released their first album, ''Dragline'', in 1993. Their most well-known songs are from this period which received moderate rotation on the radio and on ''[[Headbanger's Ball]]'', MTV's hard rock/heavy metal showcase. Music videos were made for the hits \"Jessie\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/25623266|title=Paw - Jessie|website=Vimeo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}</ref> \"Couldn't Know\"<ref>{{Citation|last=JotaGrunge|title=Paw - Couldn't know|date=2010-01-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDVpRR755rc|accessdate=2018-05-05}}</ref> and \"Sleeping Bag\".<ref>{{Citation|last=lovedder|title=Paw - Sleeping Bag|date=2009-11-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTEoEDyleEU|accessdate=2018-05-05}}</ref> Paw toured the UK in 1993 supporting [[Tool (band)|Tool]] with [[Headswim]] (months after Tool's UK support slot with [[Rage Against the Machine]]), introducing the band to an audience outside of America. The band recorded two sessions for [[BBC Radio 1]]'s rock show in 1993 (during which they played the [[Reading Festival]]). Their songs \"Jessie\", \"Pansy\" and \"The Bridge\" (plus an alternate version of the video of the first<ref>{{Citation|last=lovedder|title=Paw - Jessie|date=2009-10-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHjezzvPBdo|accessdate=2018-05-05}}</ref>) were used in the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]], [[Personal computer|PC]], [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] versions of the video game ''[[Road Rash]]''.\n\nIn 1995, the band released its second album, ''[[Death to Traitors|Death To Traitors]]'', on A&M Records. During this period, the band evolved by adding more instrumental and country elements to soften their hard rock edge. The band toured Europe and the UK in early 1995, as well as touring Australia in October 1995. While the album received favorable reviews from the press, sales were less successful, and Paw was dropped by A&M in 1996, before their contract was fulfilled.\n\nIn 1998, Grant Fitch, Peter Fitch and Dan Hines formed the band Palomar and released the album ''World Without Horses''. A reviewer described Palomar as \"a gentler and more melodic sound than Paw.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timmcmahan.com/paw.htm |title=Lazyeye Interview: Paw |website=Timmcmahan.com |date=1998-09-10 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> Paw also released a full-length compilation of B-sides and rarities entitled ''[[Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself|Keep The Last Bullet For Yourself]]'' on their own label, Outlaw Records. Paw still played together during this period, and both ''World Without Horses'' and ''Keep The Last Bullet For Yourself'' were released on these shows.\n\nIn 2000, founding members Hennessy and Fitch signed Paw with Koch Records and released the mini-album ''[[Home Is a Strange Place|Home Is A Strange Place]]'' the same year. The new album incorporated a more pronounced [[southern rock]] element. After that they split.\n\n== Post-Paw activities ==\nHennessy's book of poetry, ''Cue the Bedlam (More Desperate with Longing Than Want of Air)'', was published in December 2005 by Unholy Day Press.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unholydaypress.com/hennessy_work.htm|title=Hennessy's author page at Unholy Day Press|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206202154/http://unholydaypress.com/hennessy_work.htm|archivedate=2013-12-06}}</ref> He joinen on vocals with Mike Ratzo (bass guitar, vocals and guitar), Justin Parr (drums), Brody Buster (guitar, harmonica and keys), Heather Lofflin (vocals and guitar), James Garvic (bass guitar and guitar) and Kurt Nesbitt (bass guitar) in The Diamond Heart Club in Lawrence, from 2006-2007.

The band recorded two sessions for [[BBC Radio 1]]'s rock show in 1993 (during which they played the [[Reading Festival]]). Their songs \"Jessie\", \"Pansy\" and \"The Bridge\" (plus an alternate version of the video of the first<ref>{{Citation|last=lovedder|title=Paw - Jessie|date=2009-10-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHjezzvPBdo|accessdate=2018-05-05}}</ref>) were used in the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]], [[Personal computer|PC]], [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] versions of the video game ''[[Road Rash]]''.\n\nIn 1995, the band released its second album, ''[[Death to Traitors|Death To Traitors]]'', on A&M Records. During this period, the band evolved by adding more instrumental and country elements to soften their hard rock edge. The band toured Europe and the UK in early 1995, as well as touring Australia in October 1995. While the album received favorable reviews from the press, sales were less successful, and Paw was dropped by A&M in 1996, before their contract was fulfilled.\n\nIn 1998, Grant Fitch, Peter Fitch and Dan Hines formed the band Palomar and released the album ''World Without Horses''. A reviewer described Palomar as \"a gentler and more melodic sound than Paw.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timmcmahan.com/paw.htm |title=Lazyeye Interview: Paw |website=Timmcmahan.com |date=1998-09-10 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> Paw also released a full-length compilation of B-sides and rarities entitled ''[[Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself|Keep The Last Bullet For Yourself]]'' on their own label, Outlaw Records. Paw still played together during this period, and both ''World Without Horses'' and ''Keep The Last Bullet For Yourself'' were released on these shows.\n\nIn 2000, founding members Hennessy and Fitch signed Paw with Koch Records and released the mini-album ''[[Home Is a Strange Place|Home Is A Strange Place]]'' the same year. The new album incorporated a more pronounced [[southern rock]] element. After that they split.\n\n== Post-Paw activities ==\nHennessy's book of poetry, ''Cue the Bedlam (More Desperate with Longing Than Want of Air)'', was published in December 2005 by Unholy Day Press.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unholydaypress.com/hennessy_work.htm|title=Hennessy's author page at Unholy Day Press|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206202154/http://unholydaypress.com/hennessy_work.htm|archivedate=2013-12-06}}</ref> He joinen on vocals with Mike Ratzo (bass guitar, vocals and guitar), Justin Parr (drums), Brody Buster (guitar, harmonica and keys), Heather Lofflin (vocals and guitar), James Garvic (bass guitar and guitar) and Kurt Nesbitt (bass guitar) in The Diamond Heart Club in Lawrence, from 2006-2007.
