The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called power pellets causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.\n\nThe development of the game began in early 1979, directed by [[Toru Iwatani]] with a nine-man team. Iwatani wanted to create a game that could appeal to women as well as men, because most video games of the time have themes of war or sports. Although the inspiration for the Pac-Man character was, reportedly, the image of a pizza with a slice removed, Iwatani has said he also rounded out the Japanese symbol \"kuchi\", meaning \"mouth\". The in-game characters were made to be cute and colorful to appeal to younger players. The original Japanese title of ''Puckman'' was derived from the titular character's hockey-puck shape.\n\n''Pac-Man'' was a widespread critical and commercial success, and has an enduring commercial and cultural legacy. The game is important and influential, and it is commonly listed as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. The success of the game led to several [[List of Pac-Man video games|sequels]], merchandise, and two television series, as well as a hit single by [[Buckner & Garcia|Buckner and Garcia]]. The ''Pac-Man'' video game franchise remains one of the highest-grossing and best-selling game series of all time, generating more than $14 billion in revenue ({{as of|2016|lc=yes}}) and $43 million in sales combined. The character of Pac-Man is the mascot and flagship icon of [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] and has the highest brand awareness of any video game character in North America.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Pac-man.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot. The four ghosts are at box in the center of the screen; Pac-Man is situated underneath them. To the bottom is the player's life count and the level icon (represented by a cherry), to the top is the player's score.]]\n''Pac-Man'' is a [[maze video game|maze chase]] video game. The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|the titular character]] through an enclosed maze; the objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts \u2014 Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange) \u2014 that pursue him. When all of the dots are eaten, the player advances to the next level. If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts have their own unique, distinct [[artificial intelligence]] (A.I.), or \"personalities\"; Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man, Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him, and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015061417/http://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |archivedate=October 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>\n\nPlaced at the four corners of the maze are large flashing \"energizers\", or \"power pellets\". Eating these will cause the ghosts to turn blue with a dizzied expression and reverse direction. Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when eaten, their eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze. Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value. Blue-colored ghosts will flash white when they are about to turn back into their normal, lethal form. Eating a certain number of dots in a level will cause a bonus item, usually in the form of a fruit, to appear underneath the regeneration box, which can be eaten for bonus points.\n\nThe game increases in difficulty as the player progresses; the ghosts become faster and the power pellets decrease in length, to the point where the ghosts will no longer turn blue and edible. To the sides of the maze are two large \"warp tunnels\", which allow Pac-Man and the ghosts to travel to the opposite side of the screen. Ghosts become slower when entering and exiting these tunnels. Levels are indicated by the fruit icon at the bottom of the screen. In-between levels are short cutscenes featuring Pac-Man and Blinky in humorous, comical situations. The game becomes unplayable at the 256th level due to an [[integer overflow]] that affects the game's memory, rendering this level unbeatable.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cult Fiction |last1=Dwyer |first1=James |last2=Dwyer |first2=Brendan |publisher=Paused Books |year=2014 |isbn=9780992988401 |page=14}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nAfter acquiring the struggling Japanese division of [[Atari]] in 1976, video game developer [[Namco]] had begun producing their own video games in-house, as opposed to simply licensing them from other developers and distributing them in Japan.<ref name=\"nytimes nakamura\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/business/pac-man-masaya-nakamura-dead.html?_r=0 |title=Masaya Nakamura, Whose Company Created Pac-Man, Dies at 91 |first=Jonathan |last=Sobel |date=January 30, 2017 |accessdate=January 30, 2017 |work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Ultimate History\"/> Company president [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]] created a small video game development group within the company and ordered them to study several [[NEC]]-produced microcomputers to potentially create new games with.<ref name=\"AAN\">{{cite book |author1=Microcomputer BASIC Editorial Department |title=All About Namco |date=December 1986 |publisher=Dempa Shimbun |isbn=978-4885541070 |language=Japanese}}</ref><ref name=\"Supercade\">{{cite book |title=Supercade |last=Burnham |first=Van |year=2001 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-262-02492-6 |page=181}}</ref> One of the first people assigned to this division was a young 24-year-old employee named [[Toru Iwatani]].<ref name=\"Programmers At Work\"/> He created Namco's first video game ''[[Gee Bee (video game)|Gee Bee]]'' in 1978, which while unsuccessful helped the company gain a stronger foothold in the quickly-growing video game industry.<ref name=\"4Gamer\">{{cite web |last1=Kurokawa |first1=Fumio |title=\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u8a9e\u308a\u90e8\u305f\u3061 \u7b2c4\u90e8\uff1a\u77f3\u6751\u7e41\u4e00\u6c0f\u304c\u8a9e\u308b\u30ca\u30e0\u30b3\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u5275\u696d\u8005\u30fb\u4e2d\u6751\u96c5\u54c9\u6c0f\u306e\u9b45\u529b |url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20180313040/ |language=Japanese |website=[[4Gamer]] |publisher=Aetas |accessdate=2 August 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801205701/https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20180313040/ |archivedate=1 August 2019 |date=17 March 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Akagi\">{{cite book|last=Masumi|first= Akagi |title=It Started With Pong |publisher=Amusement News Agency |year=2005 |page=183-184}}</ref> He also assisted in the production of two sequels, ''[[Bomb Bee]]'' and ''[[Cutie Q]]'', both released in 1979.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bomb Bee - Videogame by Namco |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7179 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate=1 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802063946/http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7179 |archivedate=2 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cutie Q - Videogame by Namco |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7462 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate=1 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016144809/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7462 |archivedate=16 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Toru Iwatani, creator of Pac-Man, at GDC 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Creator [[Toru Iwatani]] at the 2011 [[Game Developers Conference]].]]\nThe Japanese video game industry had surged in popularity with games such as ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', which lead to the market being flooded with similar titles from other manufacturers in an attempt to cash in on the success.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/><ref name=\"Iwatani\">{{cite book|last=Iwatani |first=Toru |title=Introduction to Pac-Man's Game Science |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |year=2005 |page=33}}</ref> Iwatani felt that arcade games only appealed to men for their crude graphics and violence,<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/> and that arcades in general were seen as seedy environments.<ref name=\"Time\"/> For his next project, Iwatani chose to create a non-violent, cheerful video game that appealed mostly to women,<ref>{{cite book| first=Chris | last=Kohler |year=2005|title=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|pages=51\u201352|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auMTAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=July 16, 2019}}</ref> as he believed that attracting women and couples into arcades would potentially make them appear to be much-more family friendly in tone.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/> Iwatani began thinking of things that women liked to do in their time;

The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called power pellets causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.\n\nThe development of the game began in early 1979, directed by [[Toru Iwatani]] with a nine-man team. Iwatani wanted to create a game that could appeal to women as well as men, because most video games of the time have themes of war or sports. Although the inspiration for the Pac-Man character was, reportedly, the image of a pizza with a slice removed, Iwatani has said he also rounded out the Japanese symbol \"kuchi\", meaning \"mouth\". The in-game characters were made to be cute and colorful to appeal to younger players. The original Japanese title of ''Puckman'' was derived from the titular character's hockey-puck shape.\n\n''Pac-Man'' was a widespread critical and commercial success, and has an enduring commercial and cultural legacy. The game is important and influential, and it is commonly listed as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. The success of the game led to several [[List of Pac-Man video games|sequels]], merchandise, and two television series, as well as a hit single by [[Buckner & Garcia|Buckner and Garcia]]. The ''Pac-Man'' video game franchise remains one of the highest-grossing and best-selling game series of all time, generating more than $14 billion in revenue ({{as of|2016|lc=yes}}) and $43 million in sales combined. The character of Pac-Man is the mascot and flagship icon of [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] and has the highest brand awareness of any video game character in North America.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Pac-man.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot. The four ghosts are at box in the center of the screen; Pac-Man is situated underneath them. To the bottom is the player's life count and the level icon (represented by a cherry), to the top is the player's score.]]\n''Pac-Man'' is a [[maze video game|maze chase]] video game. The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|the titular character]] through an enclosed maze; the objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts \u2014 Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange) \u2014 that pursue him. When all of the dots are eaten, the player advances to the next level. If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts have their own unique, distinct [[artificial intelligence]] (A.I.), or \"personalities\"; Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man, Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him, and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015061417/http://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |archivedate=October 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>\n\nPlaced at the four corners of the maze are large flashing \"energizers\", or \"power pellets\". Eating these will cause the ghosts to turn blue with a dizzied expression and reverse direction. Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when eaten, their eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze. Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value. Blue-colored ghosts will flash white when they are about to turn back into their normal, lethal form. Eating a certain number of dots in a level will cause a bonus item, usually in the form of a fruit, to appear underneath the regeneration box, which can be eaten for bonus points.\n\nThe game increases in difficulty as the player progresses; the ghosts become faster and the power pellets decrease in length, to the point where the ghosts will no longer turn blue and edible. To the sides of the maze are two large \"warp tunnels\", which allow Pac-Man and the ghosts to travel to the opposite side of the screen. Ghosts become slower when entering and exiting these tunnels. Levels are indicated by the fruit icon at the bottom of the screen. In-between levels are short cutscenes featuring Pac-Man and Blinky in humorous, comical situations. The game becomes unplayable at the 256th level due to an [[integer overflow]] that affects the game's memory, rendering this level unbeatable.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cult Fiction |last1=Dwyer |first1=James |last2=Dwyer |first2=Brendan |publisher=Paused Books |year=2014 |isbn=9780992988401 |page=14}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nAfter acquiring the struggling Japanese division of [[Atari]] in 1976, video game developer [[Namco]] had begun producing their own video games in-house, as opposed to simply licensing them from other developers and distributing them in Japan.<ref name=\"nytimes nakamura\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/business/pac-man-masaya-nakamura-dead.html?_r=0 |title=Masaya Nakamura, Whose Company Created Pac-Man, Dies at 91 |first=Jonathan |last=Sobel |date=January 30, 2017 |accessdate=January 30, 2017 |work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Ultimate History\"/> Company president [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]] created a small video game development group within the company and ordered them to study several [[NEC]]-produced microcomputers to potentially create new games with.<ref name=\"AAN\">{{cite book |author1=Microcomputer BASIC Editorial Department |title=All About Namco |date=December 1986 |publisher=Dempa Shimbun |isbn=978-4885541070 |language=Japanese}}</ref><ref name=\"Supercade\">{{cite book |title=Supercade |last=Burnham |first=Van |year=2001 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-262-02492-6 |page=181}}</ref> One of the first people assigned to this division was a young 24-year-old employee named [[Toru Iwatani]].<ref name=\"Programmers At Work\"/> He created Namco's first video game ''[[Gee Bee (video game)|Gee Bee]]'' in 1978, which while unsuccessful helped the company gain a stronger foothold in the quickly-growing video game industry.<ref name=\"4Gamer\">{{cite web |last1=Kurokawa |first1=Fumio |title=\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u8a9e\u308a\u90e8\u305f\u3061 \u7b2c4\u90e8\uff1a\u77f3\u6751\u7e41\u4e00\u6c0f\u304c\u8a9e\u308b\u30ca\u30e0\u30b3\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u5275\u696d\u8005\u30fb\u4e2d\u6751\u96c5\u54c9\u6c0f\u306e\u9b45\u529b |url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20180313040/ |language=Japanese |website=[[4Gamer]] |publisher=Aetas |accessdate=2 August 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801205701/https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20180313040/ |archivedate=1 August 2019 |date=17 March 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Akagi\">{{cite book|last=Masumi|first= Akagi |title=It Started With Pong |publisher=Amusement News Agency |year=2005 |page=183-184}}</ref> He also assisted in the production of two sequels, ''[[Bomb Bee]]'' and ''[[Cutie Q]]'', both released in 1979.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bomb Bee - Videogame by Namco |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7179 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate=1 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802063946/http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7179 |archivedate=2 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cutie Q - Videogame by Namco |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7462 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate=1 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016144809/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7462 |archivedate=16 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Toru Iwatani, creator of Pac-Man, at GDC 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Creator [[Toru Iwatani]] at the 2011 [[Game Developers Conference]].]]\nThe Japanese video game industry had surged in popularity with games such as ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', which lead to the market being flooded with similar titles from other manufacturers in an attempt to cash in on the success.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/><ref name=\"Iwatani\">{{cite book|last=Iwatani |first=Toru |title=Introduction to Pac-Man's Game Science |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |year=2005 |page=33}}</ref> Iwatani felt that arcade games only appealed to men for their crude graphics and violence,<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/> and that arcades in general were seen as seedy environments.<ref name=\"Time\"/> For his next project, Iwatani chose to create a non-violent, cheerful video game that appealed mostly to women,<ref>{{cite book| first=Chris | last=Kohler |year=2005|title=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|pages=51\u201352|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auMTAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=July 16, 2019}}</ref> as he believed that attracting women and couples into arcades would potentially make them appear to be much-more family friendly in tone.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/> Iwatani began thinking of things that women liked to do in their time;
