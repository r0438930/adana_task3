She is best known for her innovative, quick connections and high degree of difficulty on balance beam and uneven bars. She is the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2018 World]] and [[2017 Asian Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2017 Asian]] champion on balance beam, and the [[Gymnastics at the 2018 Asian Games \u2013 Women's uneven bars|2018 Asian Games]] and [[2019 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2019 Chinese]] champion on the uneven bars.

Representing the province of Guangdong, she qualified in fifth place to the all-around final and seventh place to the balance beam final. She was initially the first reverse for the floor exercise final, but ultimately entered the final after Jiang Tong withdrew. In the team final, Liu contributed counting scores on all four events and ultimately won the silver medal. She then placed sixth in the all-around final, where she was the top-scoring junior. She concluded the competition by placing eighth in the balance beam final and fifth in the floor exercise final.\n\nShe also competed at the senior-level [[2013 National Games of China|2013 National Games]], a multi-sport event with nearly 10,000 participating athletes, where she placed fourth with her provincial team.\n\n====2014: Junior National Champion====\n\nLiu made her international debut the following year at the [[2014 Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championships|2014 Pacific Rim Championships]] in April, where she won a bronze medal with the team and qualified to all five junior individual finals. She recorded the fifth-highest total score in the junior individual all-around behind [[Bailie Key]], [[Nia Dennis]], and [[Norah Flatley]] of the United States and countrywoman [[Luo Huan]], although after Flatley's exclusion due to the two-per-country rule she placed fourth.

She led her provincial team to the silver medal, once again contributing counting scores on every event. Her vault and uneven bars scores were both top-five among all gymnasts in the team final. She then placed ninth in the individual all-around final, sixth in the uneven bars final, and fifth in the floor exercise final. She won her first individual national medal by placing third in the balance beam final behind [[Shang Chunsong]] and [[Bai Yawen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2014/05/12/2014-chinese-championships-results/|title=2014 Chinese Championships Results|date=2014-05-12|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nLiu dominated at her final competition of the year in June, the National Junior Championships. She won the all-around, uneven bars, and floor exercise titles, placed second on vault behind [[Liu Jinru]], and second on balance beam behind Zhang Wenxin.\n\n====2015====\n\nLiu's first major competition of the year was the [[2015 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2015 Chinese National Championships]] at the end of May, marking her third time competing at the senior-level championships. Liu qualified in second place to the all-around final, behind only [[Wang Yan (gymnast)|Wang Yan]], third place to the uneven bars final behind [[Fan Yilin]] and [[Tan Jiaxin]], and fourth place to the floor exercise final. In the team competition, Liu once again led the Guangdong provincial team to the podium, winning a team bronze medal.

Although she was considered a podium threat for the all-around, mistakes on floor exercise in the all-around final ultimately resulted in a fifth-place finish.

In the event finals, Liu continued performing very well. She won the Chinese uneven bars title ahead of Cheng Shiyi and [[Ou Yushan]] after a major error from pre-final favorite [[Fan Yilin]], placed fourth on balance beam behind Ou, [[Tang Xijing]], and [[Qi Qi (gymnast)|Qi Qi]], and third on floor exercise behind [[Shang Chunsong]] and Ou.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2019/05/16/2019-chinese-championships-results/|title=2019 Chinese Championships Results|date=2019-05-16|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nLiu did not compete again until October, when she was named as the captain of the Chinese team for the [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2019 World Championships]] in [[Stuttgart|Stuttgart, Germany]] alongside [[Chen Yile]], [[Li Shijia]], [[Qi Qi (gymnast)|Qi Qi]], [[Tang Xijing]], and alternate [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sports.xinhuanet.com/c/2019-09/17/c_1125004487.htm|title=\u4f53\u64cd\u4e16\u9526\u8d5b\u4e2d\u56fd\u961f\u53c2\u8d5b\u540d\u5355\u63ed\u6653-\u65b0\u534e\u7f51\u4f53\u80b2|website=sports.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> This announcement made Liu the only Chinese gymnast to be a member of all three world championships teams during the 2017-2020 quadrennium.\n\nIn the [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships#Qualification#Women's results|qualification round]], Liu competed the all-around along with Li and Tang, contributing counting scores on uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise. As a team, China qualified in second place, behind the United States by roughly five points and ahead of third-place Russia by roughly one point. Individually, Liu recorded the sixth-highest all-around score, just ahead of her teammate Li, but qualified into the all-around in fifth place after [[Grace McCallum]]'s exclusion due to the two-per-country limit. Additionally, Liu qualified in sixth place to the uneven bars final (teammate Tang was the first alternate), and in third place to the balance beam final behind [[Simone Biles]] and Li.\n\nIn the team final, Liu performed below her usual standards. Competing last on uneven bars, she fell twice during her routine and scored nearly three points lower than her score in qualifications. On balance beam, another fall cost her roughly two points compared to her qualification routine.

She concluded the competition by placing eighth in the balance beam final and fifth in the floor exercise final.\n\nShe also competed at the senior-level [[2013 National Games of China|2013 National Games]], a multi-sport event with nearly 10,000 participating athletes, where she placed fourth with her provincial team.\n\n====2014: Junior National Champion====\n\nLiu made her international debut the following year at the [[2014 Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championships|2014 Pacific Rim Championships]] in April, where she won a bronze medal with the team and qualified to all five junior individual finals.

She won her first individual national medal by placing third in the balance beam final behind [[Shang Chunsong]] and [[Bai Yawen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2014/05/12/2014-chinese-championships-results/|title=2014 Chinese Championships Results|date=2014-05-12|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nLiu dominated at her final competition of the year in June, the National Junior Championships. She won the all-around, uneven bars, and floor exercise titles, placed second on vault behind [[Liu Jinru]], and second on balance beam behind Zhang Wenxin.\n\n====2015====\n\nLiu's first major competition of the year was the [[2015 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2015 Chinese National Championships]] at the end of May, marking her third time competing at the senior-level championships. Liu qualified in second place to the all-around final, behind only [[Wang Yan (gymnast)|Wang Yan]], third place to the uneven bars final behind [[Fan Yilin]] and [[Tan Jiaxin]], and fourth place to the floor exercise final. In the team competition, Liu once again led the Guangdong provincial team to the podium, winning a team bronze medal.

She went on to place first on uneven bars ahead of Huan and Rianna Mizzen of Australia, first on balance beam ahead of [[Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's balance beam|reigning Olympic Champion]] [[Sanne Wevers]] of the Netherlands and [[Emily Little]], and third on floor exercise behind Australians Little and [[Georgia Godwin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/02/22/2017-melbourne-world-cup-results/|title=2017 Melbourne World Cup Results|date=2017-02-22|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nIn March, Liu competed again on the World Cup circuit alongside [[Wang Yan (gymnast)|Wang Yan]] and [[Luo Huan]], this time at the event in [[2017 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series|Doha]]. In qualifications, Liu once again advanced to three event finals by placing second on uneven bars, first on balance beam, and first on floor exercise. In event finals, she fell on uneven bars to place fourth behind Luo, [[Zs\u00f3fia Kov\u00e1cs (gymnast)|Zs\u00f3fia Kov\u00e1cs]] of Hungary, and [[Georgia-Rose Brown]] of Australia.

She qualified in third place to the all around final, competing a full-twisting Yurchenko vault as opposed to the double-twisting Yurchenko she competed in 2016, and qualified to the floor exercise final in first place. In the team final, Liu's Guangdong provincial team won gold by a large margin ahead of Beijing, marking Liu's first gold medal at the senior national championships. She was one of the favorites to win the all-around title along with top qualifiers [[Luo Huan]] and provincial teammate [[Chen Yile]], but pulled out of the all-around final after a minor injury.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/05/03/chinese-nationals-begin-this-weekend/|title=Chinese Nationals Begin This Weekend|date=2017-05-03|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> She returned for the floor exercise final and won the silver medal behind Olympian [[Shang Chunsong]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/05/06/2017-chinese-championships-results/|title=2017 Chinese Championships Results|date=2017-05-06|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nTwo weeks later, Liu competed at the [[2017 Asian Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2017 Asian Championships]] in [[Bangkok, Thailand]] as a member of the Chinese team alongside [[Luo Huan]], [[Liu Jinru]], and [[Tan Jiaxin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.agu-gymnastics.com/index.php/component/icagenda/33-7th-senior-art-asian-championships-in-bangkok-tha?Itemid=730|title=7th Senior ART Asian Championships in THA 2017|website=Asian Gymnastics Union|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> They won the team gold medal by nearly ten points ahead of North Korea and nearly 20 points ahead of Japan. In the all-around final, Liu recorded the top score on uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise to win the gold medal over reigning national all-around champion Luo and qualify in first place to those three event finals. This win marked Liu's first senior and first international all-around title. Her score on the balance beam in the all-around of 15.300 was the top international score on the apparatus of the entire 2017 season. In event finals, she placed second on uneven bars behind Luo, first on balance beam ahead of Luo, and fourth on floor exercise in a tie with Luo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/05/19/2017-asian-championships-results/|title=2017 Asian Championships Results|date=2017-05-19|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> These results made Liu, Luo, and [[Kim Su-jong|Kim Su-Jong]] of North Korea the most decorated female athletes of the championships, with four medals each.\n\nIn September, Liu was named to the nominative roster for the Chinese team for the [[2017 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2017 World Championships]] to compete the all-around alongside [[Luo Huan]], with specialists [[Wang Yan (gymnast)|Wang Yan]] and [[Fan Yilin]] rounding out the team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/09/04/i-cant-stop-myself-from-crying-chinas-worlds-team-and-retirements/|title=\u201cI Can\u2019t Stop Myself From Crying\u201d: China\u2019s Worlds Team and Retirements|date=2017-09-04|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> Shortly after, Liu competed as a member of the Guangdong provincial team at the [[2017 National Games of China|2017 National Games]].

While Liu's routine difficulty relied primarily on connecting many skills for bonuses, the injury forced her to pause between many of her skills.

In qualification, Liu tied with new senior gymnast and teammate [[Chen Yile]] for fourth place on uneven bars and placed second on balance beam behind Chen to advance to both event finals. In the team finals, Guangdong repeated as champion, with Liu contributing scores on vault, uneven bars (recording the highest score of all competitors in the team final), and balance beam. In event finals, she placed sixth on both uneven bars and balance beam after mistakes in both finals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2018/05/09/2018-chinese-championships-results/|title=2018 Chinese Championships Results|date=2018-05-09|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nIn August, Liu was named to the Chinese team for the [[Gymnastics at the 2018 Asian Games|2018 Asian Games]], a quadrennial multi-sport international competition with nearly 12,000 competitors, in [[Jakarta, Indonesia]]. Her teammates included [[Chen Yile]], [[Liu Jinru]], [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]], and Li Qi (who later withdrew and was replaced by reigning national champion [[Luo Huan]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golden-china.tumblr.com/post/176792896919/chinese-wag-asian-games-team|title=Golden China|website=Golden China|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golden-china.tumblr.com/post/177095531419/golden-china-the-rumour-is-li-qi-got-injured-on|title=Golden China|website=Golden China|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> In qualifications, Liu competed only on uneven bars, where she qualified in first place to the event final, and balance beam, where she scored the fourth-best score of all competitors, but did not qualify to the final as her teammates Chen, Zhang, and Luo all placed higher. In [[Gymnastics at the 2018 Asian Games \u2013 Women's artistic team|team finals]], Liu competed on vault instead of Chen, uneven bars, and balance beam, once again recording the highest score on uneven bars among all competitors.

In the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships#Qualification#Women's%20Results|qualification]] round, Liu placed eight on balance beam, second on the Chinese team (behind [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]]) to qualify for the event final after putting her hand down on her front tuck. She also placed ninth on uneven bars, second on the Chinese team (behind [[Luo Huan]]) and was named first alternate for that final. Overall, China qualified in third place to the team final, less than half a point behind Russia in second and more than nine points behind the United States in first place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2018/10/30/u-s-women-poised-for-fourth-straight-worlds-team-gold/|title=U.S. Women Poised for Fourth Straight Worlds Team Gold|date=2018-10-30|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships#Women's%20Results#Team|team final]], Liu had an error on uneven bars but performed well on the balance beam despite falls from teammates Chen and Zhang, tying with Japanese [[Mai Murakami]] for the third-highest score among all competitors in the team final after American [[Kara Eaker]] and French [[Marine Boyer]].

The only competitor to have fully hit her routine, [[Ana Padurariu]] of Canada, sat at the top of the leaderboard, followed by [[Simone Biles]] of the United States who had made several smaller errors. Liu performed an exceptional routine featuring strong ring leaps and her signature front handspring-front tuck acrobatic series to take the gold medal in stunning fashion.

In the qualification round, Liu individually qualified to the all-around final in first place, the uneven bars final in second place behind two-time world champion [[Fan Yilin]], the balance beam final in third place behind junior [[Ou Yushan]] and [[Luo Huan]], and the floor exercise final tied for second place behind [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]].

Her score from the day of all-around competition was half a point higher than runner-up Luo and nearly a full point above bronze medalist Ou. During the all-around, she delivered the highest score on uneven bars, the third highest score on balance beam behind juniors Ou and [[Guan Chenchen]], and the fifth highest on floor exercise. In the event finals, Liu continued performing very well. She won the Chinese uneven bars title ahead of Cheng Shiyi and [[Ou Yushan]] after a major error from pre-final favorite [[Fan Yilin]], placed fourth on balance beam behind Ou, [[Tang Xijing]], and [[Qi Qi (gymnast)|Qi Qi]], and third on floor exercise behind [[Shang Chunsong]] and Ou.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2019/05/16/2019-chinese-championships-results/|title=2019 Chinese Championships Results|date=2019-05-16|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nLiu did not compete again until October, when she was named as the captain of the Chinese team for the [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2019 World Championships]] in [[Stuttgart|Stuttgart, Germany]] alongside [[Chen Yile]], [[Li Shijia]], [[Qi Qi (gymnast)|Qi Qi]], [[Tang Xijing]], and alternate [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sports.xinhuanet.com/c/2019-09/17/c_1125004487.htm|title=\u4f53\u64cd\u4e16\u9526\u8d5b\u4e2d\u56fd\u961f\u53c2\u8d5b\u540d\u5355\u63ed\u6653-\u65b0\u534e\u7f51\u4f53\u80b2|website=sports.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> This announcement made Liu the only Chinese gymnast to be a member of all three world championships teams during the 2017-2020 quadrennium.\n\nIn the [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships#Qualification#Women's results|qualification round]], Liu competed the all-around along with Li and Tang, contributing counting scores on uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise. As a team, China qualified in second place, behind the United States by roughly five points and ahead of third-place Russia by roughly one point. Individually, Liu recorded the sixth-highest all-around score, just ahead of her teammate Li, but qualified into the all-around in fifth place after [[Grace McCallum]]'s exclusion due to the two-per-country limit. Additionally, Liu qualified in sixth place to the uneven bars final (teammate Tang was the first alternate), and in third place to the balance beam final behind [[Simone Biles]] and Li.\n\nIn the team final, Liu performed below her usual standards. Competing last on uneven bars, she fell twice during her routine and scored nearly three points lower than her score in qualifications. On balance beam, another fall cost her roughly two points compared to her qualification routine.
