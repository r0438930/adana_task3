He was the [[Anglican Diocese of Johannesburg|Bishop of Johannesburg]] from 1985 to 1986 and then the [[Archbishop of Cape Town]] from 1986 to 1996, in both cases being the first black African to hold the position. Theologically, he sought to fuse ideas from [[black theology]] with [[African theology]]; politically, he identifies as a [[socialist]].\n\nTutu was born of mixed [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Tswana people|Motswana]] heritage to a poor family in [[Klerksdorp]], [[Union of South Africa]]. Entering adulthood, he trained as a teacher and married [[Nomalizo Leah Tutu]], with whom he had several children. In 1960, he was ordained as an Anglican priest and in 1962 moved to the United Kingdom to study theology at [[King's College London]]. In 1966 he returned to southern Africa, teaching at the [[Federal Theological Seminary of Southern Africa|Federal Theological Seminary]] and then the [[University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland]]. In 1972, he became the Theological Education Fund's director for Africa, a position based in [[London]] but necessitating regular tours of the African continent. Back in southern Africa in 1975, he served first as [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg|St Mary's Cathedral]] in [[Johannesburg]] and then as [[Bishop of Lesotho]], taking an active role in opposition to South Africa's [[apartheid]] system of [[racial segregation]] and [[White South African|white-minority]] rule. From 1978 to 1985 he was general-secretary of the [[South African Council of Churches]], emerging as one of South Africa's most prominent anti-apartheid activists. Although warning the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government that anger at apartheid would lead to racial violence, as an activist he stressed [[non-violent protest]] and foreign economic pressure to bring about [[universal suffrage]].\n\nIn 1985, Tutu became Bishop of Johannesburg and in 1986 the Archbishop of Cape Town, the most senior position in southern Africa's Anglican hierarchy. In this position he emphasised a consensus-building model of leadership and oversaw the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|introduction of women priests]]. Also in 1986, he became president of the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]], resulting in further tours of the continent. After President [[F. W. de Klerk]] released the anti-apartheid activist [[Nelson Mandela]] from prison in 1990 and the pair led negotiations to end apartheid and introduce multi-racial democracy, Tutu assisted as a mediator between rival black factions. After the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 general election]] resulted in a [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|coalition government]] headed by Mandela, the latter selected Tutu to chair the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to investigate past human rights abuses committed by both pro and anti-apartheid groups. Since apartheid's fall, Tutu has campaigned for [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay rights]] and spoken out on a wide range of subjects, among them the [[Israel-Palestine conflict]], his opposition to the [[Iraq War]], and his criticism of South African Presidents [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[Jacob Zuma]]. In 2010, he retired from public life.\n\nTutu polarised opinion as he rose to notability in the 1970s. White conservatives who supported apartheid despised him, while many white [[liberalism|liberals]] regarded him as too radical; many black radicals accused him of being too moderate and focused on cultivating white goodwill, while [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninists]] criticised his [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] stance. He was widely popular among South Africa's black majority, and was internationally praised for his anti-apartheid activism, receiving a range of awards, including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. He has also compiled several books of his speeches and sermons.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood: 1931\u20131950===\n\nHurble plurk\n\n[[File:ChurchofChristtheKing.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Church of Christ the King|The Church of Christ the King in Sophiatown, where Tutu was a server under priest Trevor Huddlestone]]\n\nConcoil b\n\nIn 1936, the family moved to [[Tshing]], where Zachariah was employed as the principal of a Methodist school; they lived in a hut in the school yard.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=20}} There, Tutu started his primary education and played football with the other children,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=21}} also becoming the server at St Francis Anglican Church.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=33}} He developed a love of reading, particularly enjoying comic books and European [[fairy tales]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=30|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=21}} Here, he also learned [[Afrikaans]], the main language of the area.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=23|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=21}} It was in Tshing that his parents had a third son, Tamsanqa, who also died in infancy.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=21}} Around 1941, Tutu's mother moved to [[Witwatersrand]] to work as a cook at Ezenzeleni, an institute for the blind in western Johannesburg.

despite his objections to Hani's Marxist beliefs, Tutu had admired him as an activist.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=140|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=333\u2013334}} Amid these events, Tutu had experienced physical exhaustion and ill-health,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=327}} and he undertook a four-month sabbatical at [[Emory University]]'s Candler School of Theology in Atlanta, Georgia.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=138|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=329}}\n\nTutu had been exhilarated by the prospect that South Africa was transforming towards universal suffrage via a negotiated transition rather than a racial civil war.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=315}} He allowed his face to be used on posters encouraging South Africans to vote.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=142}} When the [[South African general election, 1994|April 1994 multi-racial general election]] took place, Tutu was visibly exuberant, telling reporters that \"we are on cloud nine\".{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=142|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=338}} He voted in Cape Town's [[Gugulethu]] township.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=142|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=338}} The ANC won the election and Mandela was declared president, overseeing the formation of a government of national unity.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=143|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=339}} Tutu attended Mandela's inauguration ceremony and had been responsible for planning its religious component; Tutu had insisted that it be a multi-religious ceremony, with Christian, Muslim, Jewish, and Hindu leaders taking part in prayers and readings.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=338\u2013339}}\n\n====International affairs====\n\nAlongside his domestic work, he also turned his attention to events elsewhere in Africa, and in 1987 gave the keynote speech at the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]] (AACC) in [[Lom\u00e9]], Togo. There, he called on churches to champion the oppressed throughout the continent, stating that \"it pains us to have to admit that there is less freedom and personal liberty in most of Africa now then there was during the much-maligned colonial days.\"{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=347\u2013348}} At the conference, he was elected president of the AACC, while [[Jos\u00e9 Belo]] was elected its general-secretary. Calling for an \"African renaissance\" across the continent, the pair formed a partnership that would last a decade.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=130|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=375}} In 1989 they visited Zaire to encourage the country's churches to distance themselves from Seko's autocratic government.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=130|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=375}} In 1994, he and Belo visited war-torn Liberia in a mission co-organised by the AACC and the [[Carter Center]]. There, they met [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]], but Tutu did not trust his promise of a ceasefire.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=376\u2013377}} In 1995, Mandela sent Tutu to Nigeria to meet with Nigerian military leader [[Sani Abacha]] to request the release of imprisoned politicians [[Moshood Abiola]] and [[Olusegun Obasanjo]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=377}} In July 1995, he visited Rwanda a year after the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]], where he preached to 10,000 people in [[Kigali]]. Drawing on his experiences in South Africa, he called for justice to be tempered with mercy towards the Hutu who had orchestrated the genocide.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=377\u2013378}} Tutu also travelled to other parts of world, for instance spending March 1989 in Panama and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=130}}\n\nTutu also spoke out on the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]]. While in New York in 1989, he had praised God for the creation of the state of Israel and asserted its right to \"territorial integrity and fundamental security against attacks from those who deny her right to exist\".{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=129|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=383}} He visited [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] leader [[Yasser Arafat]] in Cairo, urging him to accept Israel's existence.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=385}} At the same time he expressed anger that Israel had supplied military hardware to South Africa during the apartheid era, expressing bemusement as to how the Jewish state could co-operate with a government that had contained many Nazi sympathisers.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=382\u2013383, 384}} Referring to the [[Israeli-occupied territories]] in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, he stated that there were \"deeply, deeply distressing\" parallels with the situation in apartheid South Africa.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=384}} He called for the formation of a distinct Palestinian state,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=382}} and emphasised that his criticisms were of the Israeli government rather than Jews as a broader group.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=388}} At the invite of Palestinian bishop [[Samir Kafity]], he undertook a [[Christmas]] pilgrimage to Jerusalem, where he gave a sermon at [[Shepherd's Field]] near [[Bethlehem]], in which he called for a [[two-state solution]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=384, 386}} On that trip, he also visited the [[Yad Vashem]] Holocaust memorial, where he laid a wreath and spoke to journalists on the importance of forgiveness.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=386\u2013387}} His calls to forgive those who perpetrated the Holocaust, coupled with his support for a Palestinian state, brought criticism from many Jewish groups across the world.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=387}} This was exacerbated by the fact that he sought to evade suspicions of [[anti-Semitism]] through comments such as \"my dentist is a Dr. Cohen\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=385}}\n\nTutu also spoke out regarding [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. At the Lambeth conference of 1988, he backed a resolution on the issue which condemned the use of violence by all sides; Tutu believed that, given Irish republicans had the right to vote, they had not exhausted peaceful means of bringing about change and thus should not resort to armed struggle.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=381}} Three years later, he gave a televised service from [[Dublin]]'s [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]] where he called for negotiations to take place between all factions, including the Irish republican [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], groups which Thatcher's UK government had refused to engage with.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=381}} He visited [[Belfast]] in 1998 and again in 2001.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=382}}\n\n==Later life==\nIn October 1994, Tutu announced his intention to retire as archbishop in 1996.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=144}} Although retired archbishops normally return to the position of bishop, the other bishops bestowed on him a new title: \"archbishop emeritus\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} A farewell ceremony was held at St George's Cathedral in June 1996, attended by senior politicians like Mandela and de Klerk.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} There, Mandela awarded Tutu the [[Order for Meritorious Service]], South Africa's highest honour.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} Tutu was succeeded as archbishop by Ndungane.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}}\n\nIn January 1997, Tutu was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] and travelled abroad for treatment.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=153|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=370}} He publicly revealed his diagnosis, hoping to encourage other men to go for prostate exams.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=153}} He faced recurrences of the disease in 1999 and 2006.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=370}} Back in South Africa, he divided his time between homes in Soweto's Orlando West and Cape Town's [[Milnerton]] area.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In 2000, he opened an office in Cape Town.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In June 2000, the Cape Town-based Desmond Tutu Peace Centre was launched, which in 2003 launched an Emerging Leadership Program.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}}\n\nConscious that his presence in South Africa might overshadow Ndungane, Tutu agreed to a two-year [[visiting professor]]ship at Emory University.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} This took place between 1998 and 2000, and during the period he wrote a book about the TRC, ''No Future Without Forgiveness''.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=162}} In early 2002 he taught at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} From January to May 2003 he taught at the [[University of North Carolina]].{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} In January 2004, he was visiting professor of postconflict societies at KCL, his ''alma mater''.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} While in the United States, he signed up with a speakers' agency and travelled widely on speaking engagements; this gave him financial independence in a way that his clerical pension would not.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In his speeches, he focused on South Africa's transition from apartheid to universal suffrage, presenting it as a model for other troubled nations to adopt.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=161}} In the US, he thanked anti-apartheid activists for campaigning for sanctions, also calling for US companies to now invest in South Africa.{{sfn|Gish|2004|pp=161\u2013162}}\n\n===Truth and Reconciliation Commission: 1996\u20131998===\n\n[[File:Desmond Tutu 1997.jpg|thumb|Tutu at the [[Embassy of South Africa, Washington, D.C.]], in 1997]]\nTutu popularised the term \"[[Rainbow Nation]]\" as a metaphor for [[post-apartheid South Africa]] after 1994 under ANC rule.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=520}} He had first used the metaphor in 1989 when he described a multi-racial protest crowd as the \"rainbow people of God\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=391}} Tutu advocated what liberation theologians call \"critical solidarity\", offering support for pro-democracy forces while reserving the right to criticise his allies.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=315}} He criticised Mandela on several points, such as his tendency to wear brightly coloured [[Madiba shirt]]s, which he regarded as inappropriate; Mandela offered the tongue-in-cheek response that it was ironic coming from a man who wore dresses.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=345}} More serious was Tutu's criticism of Mandela's retention of South Africa's apartheid-era armaments industry and the significant pay packet that newly elected Members of Parliament adopted.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=143\u2013144|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=345|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=517}} Mandela hit back, calling Tutu a \"populist\" and stating that he should have raised these issues privately rather than publicly.{{sfnm|1a1=Allen|1y=2006|1p=345|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2p=517}}\n\nA key question facing the post-apartheid government was how they would respond to the various human rights abuses that had been committed over the previous decades by both the state and by anti-apartheid activists. The National Party had wanted a comprehensive amnesty package whereas the ANC wanted trials of former state figures.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=343\u2013344}} [[Alex Boraine]] helped Mandela's government to draw up legislation for the establishment of a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC), which was passed by parliament in July 1995.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=344\u2013345}} Nuttall suggested that Tutu become one of the TRC's seventeen commissioners, while in September a synod of bishops formally nominated him.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=147|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=345}} Tutu proposed that the TRC adopt a threefold approach: the first being confession, with those responsible for human rights abuses fully disclosing their activities, the second being forgiveness in the form of a legal amnesty from prosecution, and the third being restitution, with the perpetrators making amends to their victims.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=344}}\n\nMandela named Tutu as the chair of the TRC, with Boraine as his deputy.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=147, 148|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=345\u2013346|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=529}} The commission was a significant undertaking, employing over 300 staff, dividing into three committees, and holding as many as four hearings simultaneously.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=346}} In the TRC, Tutu advocated \"restorative justice\", something which he considered characteristic of traditional African jurisprudence \"in the spirit of ''ubuntu''\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=347}} As head of the commission, Tutu had to deal with its various inter-personal problems, with much suspicion between those on its board who had been anti-apartheid activists and those who had supported the apartheid system.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=349}} He acknowledged that \"we really were like a bunch of prima donnas, frequently hypersensitive, often taking umbrage easily at real or imagined slights\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}} Tutu opened meetings with prayers and often referred to Christian teachings when discussing the TRC's work, frustrating some who saw him as incorporating too many religious elements into an expressly secular body.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}}\n\nThe first hearing took place in April 1996.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}} The hearings were publicly televised and had a considerable impact on South African society.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=350}} He had very little control over the committee responsible for granting amnesty, instead chairing the committee which heard accounts of human rights abuses perpetrated by both anti-apartheid and apartheid figures.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=348}} While listening to the testimony of victims, Tutu was sometimes overwhelmed by emotion and cried during the hearings.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=352}} He singled out those victims who expressed forgiveness towards those who had harmed them and used these individuals as his leitmotif.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=351}} The ANC's image was tarnished by the revelations that some of its activists had engaged in torture, attacks on civilians, and other human rights abuses. It sought to suppress part of the final TRC report, infuriating Tutu.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=157|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=366\u2013367|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3pp=531\u2013532}} He warned of the ANC's \"abuse of power\", stating that \"yesterday's oppressed can quite easily become today's oppressors... We've seen it happen all over the world and we shouldn't be surprised if it happens here\".{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=532}} Tutu presented the five-volume TRC report to Mandela in a public ceremony in Pretoria in October 1998.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=157}} Ultimately, Tutu was pleased with the TRC's achievement, believing that it would aid long-term reconciliation, although recognised its short-comings.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=158}}\n\n===Social and international issues: 1999\u20132009===\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = I would refuse to go to a homophobic heaven.

She has nurtured the deepest things in us blacks.\"{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=115}}\n\nHe became, according to Du Boulay, \"one of the most eloquent and persuasive communicators\" of black theology.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}} He expressed his views on theology largely through sermons and addresses rather than in extended academic treatises.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}}\nTutu expressed the view that Western theology sought answers to questions that Africans were not asking.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=135\u2013136}} For Tutu, two major questions were being posed by African Christianity: how to replace imported Christian expressions of faith with something authentically African, and how to liberate people from bondage.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=136}} He believed that there were many comparisons to be made between contemporary African understandings of God and those featured in the Old Testament.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=137}} He nevertheless criticised African theology for failing to sufficiently address contemporary societal problems, and suggested that to correct this it should learn from the black theology tradition.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=116}}\n\nWhen chairing the TRC, Tutu advocated an explicitly Christian model of reconciliation, as part of which he believed that South Africans had to face up to the damages that they had caused and accept the consequences of their actions.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}} As part of this, he believed that the perpetrators and beneficiaries of apartheid must admit to their actions but that the system's victims should respond generously, stating that it was a \"gospel imperative\" to forgive.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}} At the same time, he argued that those responsible had to display true repentance in the form of restitution.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\n[[File:Desmond tutu 20070607 2.jpg|thumb|Tutu at the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]], 2007]]\n\nGish noted that by the time of apartheid's fall, Tutu had attained \"worldwide respect\" for his \"uncompromising stand for justice and reconciliation and his unmatched integrity\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=148}} According to Allen, Tutu \"made a powerful and unique contribution to publicizing the antiapartheid struggle abroad\", particularly in the United States.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=233}} In the latter country, he was able to rise to prominence as a South African anti-apartheid activist because\u2014unlike Mandela and other members of the ANC\u2014he had no links to the South African Communist Party and thus was more acceptable to Americans amid the Cold War anti-communist sentiment of the period.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=253}} In the U.S., he was often compared to Martin Luther King, with the African-American civil rights activist [[Jesse Jackson]] referring to him as \"the Martin Luther King of South Africa\"; this was a comparison that Tutu was embarrassed by.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=198}}\nAfter the end of apartheid, Tutu became \"perhaps the world's most prominent religious leader advocating gay and lesbian rights\", according to Allen.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=372}} Ultimately, Allen thought that perhaps Tutu's \"greatest legacy\" was the fact that he gave \"to the world as it entered the twenty-first century an African model for expressing the nature of human community\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=396}}\n\nDuring Tutu's rise to notability during the 1970s and 1980s, responses to him were \"sharply polarized\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=201}} Noting that he was \"simultaneously loved and hated, honoured and vilified\",{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=170}} Du Boulay attributed his divisive reception to the fact that \"strong people evoke strong emotions\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=138}} Tutu gained much adulation from black journalists, inspired imprisoned anti-apartheid activists, and led to many black parents naming their children after him.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=201}} For many black South Africans, he was a respected religious leader and a symbol of black achievement.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=247}} By 1984 he was\u2014according to Gish\u2014\"the personification of the South African freedom struggle\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=103}} In 1988, Du Boulay described him as \"a spokesman for his people, a voice for the voiceless\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}}\n\nThe response he received from South Africa's white minority was more mixed. Most of those who criticised him were conservative whites who did not want a shift away from apartheid and white-minority rule.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=138|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=78}} Many of these whites were angered that he was calling for economic sanctions against South Africa and that he was warning that racial violence was impending.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=98}} Said whites often accused him of being a tool of the communists.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=236}} This hostility was exacerbated by the government's campaign to discredit Tutu and distort his image,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=97}} which included repeatedly misquoting him to present his statements out of context.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=263}} According to Du Boulay, the SABC and much of the white press went to \"extraordinary attempts to discredit him\", something that \"made it hard to know the man himself\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}} Allen noted that in 1984, Tutu was \"the black leader white South Africans most loved to hate\" and that this antipathy extended beyond supporters of the far-right government to liberals too.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=202}} The fact that he was \"an object of hate\" for many was something that deeply pained him.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=138}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Hated by many white South Africans for being too radical, he was also scorned by many black militants for being too moderate.\n| source=\u2014 On Tutu in the mid-1980s, by Steven D.

1931) is a South African [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] cleric and [[theologian]] known for his work as an [[anti-apartheid movement|anti-apartheid]] and [[human rights]] activist. He was the [[Anglican Diocese of Johannesburg|Bishop of Johannesburg]] from 1985 to 1986 and then the [[Archbishop of Cape Town]] from 1986 to 1996, in both cases being the first black African to hold the position. Theologically, he sought to fuse ideas from [[black theology]] with [[African theology]]; politically, he identifies as a [[socialist]].\n\nTutu was born of mixed [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Tswana people|Motswana]] heritage to a poor family in [[Klerksdorp]], [[Union of South Africa]]. Entering adulthood, he trained as a teacher and married [[Nomalizo Leah Tutu]], with whom he had several children. In 1960, he was ordained as an Anglican priest and in 1962 moved to the United Kingdom to study theology at [[King's College London]]. In 1966 he returned to southern Africa, teaching at the [[Federal Theological Seminary of Southern Africa|Federal Theological Seminary]] and then the [[University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland]]. In 1972, he became the Theological Education Fund's director for Africa, a position based in [[London]] but necessitating regular tours of the African continent. Back in southern Africa in 1975, he served first as [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg|St Mary's Cathedral]] in [[Johannesburg]] and then as [[Bishop of Lesotho]], taking an active role in opposition to South Africa's [[apartheid]] system of [[racial segregation]] and [[White South African|white-minority]] rule. From 1978 to 1985 he was general-secretary of the [[South African Council of Churches]], emerging as one of South Africa's most prominent anti-apartheid activists. Although warning the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government that anger at apartheid would lead to racial violence, as an activist he stressed [[non-violent protest]] and foreign economic pressure to bring about [[universal suffrage]].\n\nIn 1985, Tutu became Bishop of Johannesburg and in 1986 the Archbishop of Cape Town, the most senior position in southern Africa's Anglican hierarchy. In this position he emphasised a consensus-building model of leadership and oversaw the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|introduction of women priests]]. Also in 1986, he became president of the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]], resulting in further tours of the continent. After President [[F. W. de Klerk]] released the anti-apartheid activist [[Nelson Mandela]] from prison in 1990 and the pair led negotiations to end apartheid and introduce multi-racial democracy, Tutu assisted as a mediator between rival black factions. After the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 general election]] resulted in a [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|coalition government]] headed by Mandela, the latter selected Tutu to chair the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to investigate past human rights abuses committed by both pro and anti-apartheid groups. Since apartheid's fall, Tutu has campaigned for [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay rights]] and spoken out on a wide range of subjects, among them the [[Israel-Palestine conflict]], his opposition to the [[Iraq War]], and his criticism of South African Presidents [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[Jacob Zuma]]. In 2010, he retired from public life.\n\nTutu polarised opinion as he rose to notability in the 1970s. White conservatives who supported apartheid despised him, while many white [[liberalism|liberals]] regarded him as too radical; many black radicals accused him of being too moderate and focused on cultivating white goodwill, while [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninists]] criticised his [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] stance. He was widely popular among South Africa's black majority, and was internationally praised for his anti-apartheid activism, receiving a range of awards, including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. He has also compiled several books of his speeches and sermons.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood: 1931\u20131950===\n\nDesmond Mpilo Tutu was born on 7 October 1931 in [[Klerksdorp]], a city in [[North West (South African province)|northwest South Africa]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=22|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=2|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=9\u201310}} His mother, Allen Dorothea Mavoertsek Mathlare, was born to a [[Tswana people|Motswana]] family in [[Boksburg]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=22|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=10}} His father, Zachariah Zelilo Tutu, was from the [[Fengu people|amaFengu]] branch of [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and had grown up in [[Gcuwa]], [[Eastern Cape]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=22|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=10\u201311}} At home, the couple both spoke the [[Xhosa language]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=11}} Zachariah trained as a primary school teacher at [[Lovedale (South Africa)|Lovedale]] college before taking a post in Boksburg, where he married his wife.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=14}} In the late 1920s, he took a job in Klerksdorp; in the [[Afrikaaner]]-founded city, he and his wife resided in the black residential area. Established in 1907, it was then known as the \"native location\" although was later renamed Makoetend.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=14\u201315}} The native location housed a diverse community; although most residents were [[Tswana people|Tswana]], it also housed Xhosa, [[Sotho people|Sotho]], and a few Indian traders.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=16}} Zachariah worked as the principal of a [[Methodism|Methodist]] primary school and the family lived in the schoolmaster's house, a small mud-brick building in the yard of the Methodist mission.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=16}}\n\n[[File:ChurchofChristtheKing.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Church of Christ the King|The Church of Christ the King in Sophiatown, where Tutu was a server under priest Trevor Huddlestone]]\n\nThe Tutus were poor;{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=28|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=3}} describing his family, Tutu later related that \"although we weren't affluent, we were not destitute either\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=21}} Tutu had an older sister, Sylvia Funeka, who called him \"Mpilo\" (\"life\"), a name given to him by his paternal grandmother.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=22, 29|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=3|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=19}} The rest of the family called him \"Boy\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=19}} He was his parent's second son; their firstborn boy, Sipho, had died in infancy.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=19}} Another daughter, Gloria Lindiwe, would be born after him.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=22}} Tutu was sickly from birth;{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=2|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=19}} [[polio]] resulted in the atrophy of his right hand,{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=32|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=19}} and on one occasion he was hospitalised with serious burns.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=20}} Tutu had a close relationship with his father, although was angered at the latter's heavy drinking, during which he would sometimes beat his wife.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=22|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=3|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=22}} The family were initially Methodists and Tutu was [[baptism|baptised]] into the [[Methodist Church of Southern Africa|Methodist Church]] in June 1932.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=30|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=33}} They subsequently changed denominations, first to the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] and then to the [[Anglican Church]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=30\u201331|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=33}}\n\nIn 1936, the family moved to [[Tshing]], where Zachariah was employed as the principal of a Methodist school; they lived in a hut in the school yard.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=20}} There, Tutu started his primary education and played football with the other children,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=21}} also becoming the server at St Francis Anglican Church.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=33}} He developed a love of reading, particularly enjoying comic books and European [[fairy tales]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=30|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=21}} Here, he also learned [[Afrikaans]], the main language of the area.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=23|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=21}} It was in Tshing that his parents had a third son, Tamsanqa, who also died in infancy.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=21}} Around 1941, Tutu's mother moved to [[Witwatersrand]] to work as a cook at Ezenzeleni, an institute for the blind in western Johannesburg. Tutu joined her in the city, first living with an aunt in [[Roodepoort|Roodepoort West]] before they secured their own house in the township.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=5|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=24}} In Johannesburg, he attended a Methodist primary school before transferring to the [[Swedish Boarding School]] (SBS) in the [[St. Martin's School (Rosettenville)|St Agnes Mission]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=24}} Several months later, he moved with his father to [[Ermelo]], eastern Transvaal.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=25}} After six months, the duo returned to live with the rest of the family in Roodepoort West, where Tutu resuming his studies at SBS.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=25}} He had pursued his interest in [[Christianity]] and at the age of 12 underwent [[confirmation]] at St Mary's Church, Roodepoort.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=34}}\n\nTutu failed the arithmetic component of his primary school exam, but despite this, his father secured him entry to the Johannesburg Bantu High School in 1945, where he excelled academically.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=25, 34\u201335}} There, he joined a school [[rugby union|rugby]] team, developing a lifelong love of the sport.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=36}} Outside of school, he earned money selling oranges and as a [[caddie]] for white [[golf]]ers.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=27|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=7|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=37}} To avoid the expense of a daily train commute to school, he briefly lived with family nearer to Johannesburg, before moving back in with his parents when they relocated to [[Munsieville]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=36, 37\u201338}} He then returned to Johannesburg by moving into a hostel that was part of the Anglican complex surrounding the Church of Christ the King in [[Sophiatown]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=29|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=8|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=42}} He became a server at the church and came under the influence of its priest, [[Trevor Huddleston]];{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=10|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=43\u201345}} later biographer [[Shirley du Boulay]] suggested that Huddleston was \"the greatest single influence\" in Tutu's life.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=31}} In 1947, Tutu contracted [[tuberculosis]] and was hospitalised in [[Rietfontein]] for 18 months, during which he spent much of his time reading and was regularly visited by Huddleston.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=29\u201330|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=9|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=45\u201346}} In the hospital, he underwent a [[circumcision]] to mark his transition to manhood.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=47}} He returned to school in 1949 and took his national exams in late 1950, gaining a second-class pass.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=47\u201348}}\n\n===College and teaching career: 1951\u20131955===\n\nWanting to become a doctor, Desmond Tutu secured admission to study medicine at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]; however, his parents could not afford the tuition fees.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=47\u201348}} Instead, he turned toward teaching, gaining a government scholarship to start a course at Pretoria Bantu Normal College, a teacher training institution, in 1951.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=12|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=48}} There, he served as treasurer of the Student Representative Council, helped to organise the Literacy and Dramatic Society, and chaired the Cultural and Debating Society for two years.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=48}} It was during one local debating event that he first met the lawyer\u2014and future president of South Africa\u2014[[Nelson Mandela]]; the latter did not remember the meeting and they would not encounter each other again until 1990.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=17|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=48\u201349}} At the college, Tutu attained his Transvaal Bantu Teachers Diploma, having gained advice about taking exams from the activist [[Robert Sobukwe]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=37|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=18|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=50}} He had also taken five correspondence courses provided by the [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA), graduating in the same class as future Zimbabwean leader [[Robert Mugabe]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=37|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=18|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=49\u201350}}\n\nIn 1954, he began teaching English at Madibane High School; the following year, he transferred to the [[Krugersdorp High School]], where he taught English and history.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=37|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=17, 18|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=50\u201351}} He began courting Nomalizo Leah Shenxane, a friend of his sister Gloria who was studying to become a primary school teacher.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=18|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=51}} They were legally married at Krugersdorp Native Commissioner's Court in June 1955, before undergoing a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] wedding ceremony at the Church of Mary Queen of Apostles; although he was an Anglican, Tutu had agreed to the ceremony due to Leah's Roman Catholic faith.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=38|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=51\u201352}} The newly married couple initially lived in a room at Tutu's parental home before renting their own home six months later.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=52}} Their first child, Trevor, was born in April 1956;{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=22|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=53}} their first daughter, Thandeka, appeared 16 months later.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=53}} The couple worshipped at St Paul's Church, where Tutu volunteered as a [[Sunday school]] teacher, assistant choirmaster, church councillor, lay preacher, and sub-deacon,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=53}} while outside of the church he also volunteered as a football administrator for a local team.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=52}}\n\n===Joining the clergy: 1956\u20131966===\n\n[[File:St Albans, Golders Green-2.jpg|thumb|right|Tutu first ministered to a white congregation at the Church of St Alban the Martyr in Golders Green, living with his family in the curate's flat]]\n\nIn 1953, the white-minority [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government had introduced the [[Bantu Education Act, 1953|Bantu Education Act]] as a means of furthering their [[apartheid]] system of racial segregation and white domination; both Tutu and his wife disliked these changes and decided to leave the teaching profession.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=41\u201345|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=20\u201321|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=60\u201361}} With Huddleston's support, Tutu left the teaching profession to become an Anglican priest.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=23|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=61}} In January 1956, his request to join the [[Ordinands Guild]] was turned down due to the debts he had accrued;

At the Lambeth conference of 1988, he backed a resolution on the issue which condemned the use of violence by all sides; Tutu believed that, given Irish republicans had the right to vote, they had not exhausted peaceful means of bringing about change and thus should not resort to armed struggle.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=381}} Three years later, he gave a televised service from [[Dublin]]'s [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]] where he called for negotiations to take place between all factions, including the Irish republican [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], groups which Thatcher's UK government had refused to engage with.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=381}} He visited [[Belfast]] in 1998 and again in 2001.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=382}}\n\n==Later life==\nIn October 1994, Tutu announced his intention to retire as archbishop in 1996.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=144}} Although retired archbishops normally return to the position of bishop, the other bishops bestowed on him a new title: \"archbishop emeritus\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} A farewell ceremony was held at St George's Cathedral in June 1996, attended by senior politicians like Mandela and de Klerk.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} There, Mandela awarded Tutu the [[Order for Meritorious Service]], South Africa's highest honour.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} Tutu was succeeded as archbishop by Ndungane.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}}\n\nIn January 1997, Tutu was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] and travelled abroad for treatment.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=153|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=370}} He publicly revealed his diagnosis, hoping to encourage other men to go for prostate exams.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=153}} He faced recurrences of the disease in 1999 and 2006.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=370}} Back in South Africa, he divided his time between homes in Soweto's Orlando West and Cape Town's [[Milnerton]] area.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In 2000, he opened an office in Cape Town.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In June 2000, the Cape Town-based Desmond Tutu Peace Centre was launched, which in 2003 launched an Emerging Leadership Program.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}}\n\nConscious that his presence in South Africa might overshadow Ndungane, Tutu agreed to a two-year [[visiting professor]]ship at Emory University.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} This took place between 1998 and 2000, and during the period he wrote a book about the TRC, ''No Future Without Forgiveness''.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=162}} In early 2002 he taught at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} From January to May 2003 he taught at the [[University of North Carolina]].{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} In January 2004, he was visiting professor of postconflict societies at KCL, his ''alma mater''.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} While in the United States, he signed up with a speakers' agency and travelled widely on speaking engagements; this gave him financial independence in a way that his clerical pension would not.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In his speeches, he focused on South Africa's transition from apartheid to universal suffrage, presenting it as a model for other troubled nations to adopt.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=161}} In the US, he thanked anti-apartheid activists for campaigning for sanctions, also calling for US companies to now invest in South Africa.{{sfn|Gish|2004|pp=161\u2013162}}\n\n===Truth and Reconciliation Commission: 1996\u20131998===\n\n[[File:Desmond Tutu 1997.jpg|thumb|Tutu at the [[Embassy of South Africa, Washington, D.C.]], in 1997]]\nTutu popularised the term \"[[Rainbow Nation]]\" as a metaphor for [[post-apartheid South Africa]] after 1994 under ANC rule.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=520}} He had first used the metaphor in 1989 when he described a multi-racial protest crowd as the \"rainbow people of God\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=391}} Tutu advocated what liberation theologians call \"critical solidarity\", offering support for pro-democracy forces while reserving the right to criticise his allies.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=315}} He criticised Mandela on several points, such as his tendency to wear brightly coloured [[Madiba shirt]]s, which he regarded as inappropriate; Mandela offered the tongue-in-cheek response that it was ironic coming from a man who wore dresses.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=345}} More serious was Tutu's criticism of Mandela's retention of South Africa's apartheid-era armaments industry and the significant pay packet that newly elected Members of Parliament adopted.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=143\u2013144|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=345|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=517}} Mandela hit back, calling Tutu a \"populist\" and stating that he should have raised these issues privately rather than publicly.{{sfnm|1a1=Allen|1y=2006|1p=345|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2p=517}}\n\nA key question facing the post-apartheid government was how they would respond to the various human rights abuses that had been committed over the previous decades by both the state and by anti-apartheid activists. The National Party had wanted a comprehensive amnesty package whereas the ANC wanted trials of former state figures.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=343\u2013344}} [[Alex Boraine]] helped Mandela's government to draw up legislation for the establishment of a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC), which was passed by parliament in July 1995.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=344\u2013345}} Nuttall suggested that Tutu become one of the TRC's seventeen commissioners, while in September a synod of bishops formally nominated him.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=147|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=345}} Tutu proposed that the TRC adopt a threefold approach: the first being confession, with those responsible for human rights abuses fully disclosing their activities, the second being forgiveness in the form of a legal amnesty from prosecution, and the third being restitution, with the perpetrators making amends to their victims.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=344}}\n\nMandela named Tutu as the chair of the TRC, with Boraine as his deputy.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=147, 148|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=345\u2013346|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=529}} The commission was a significant undertaking, employing over 300 staff, dividing into three committees, and holding as many as four hearings simultaneously.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=346}} In the TRC, Tutu advocated \"restorative justice\", something which he considered characteristic of traditional African jurisprudence \"in the spirit of ''ubuntu''\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=347}} As head of the commission, Tutu had to deal with its various inter-personal problems, with much suspicion between those on its board who had been anti-apartheid activists and those who had supported the apartheid system.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=349}} He acknowledged that \"we really were like a bunch of prima donnas, frequently hypersensitive, often taking umbrage easily at real or imagined slights\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}} Tutu opened meetings with prayers and often referred to Christian teachings when discussing the TRC's work, frustrating some who saw him as incorporating too many religious elements into an expressly secular body.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}}\n\nThe first hearing took place in April 1996.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}} The hearings were publicly televised and had a considerable impact on South African society.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=350}} He had very little control over the committee responsible for granting amnesty, instead chairing the committee which heard accounts of human rights abuses perpetrated by both anti-apartheid and apartheid figures.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=348}} While listening to the testimony of victims, Tutu was sometimes overwhelmed by emotion and cried during the hearings.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=352}} He singled out those victims who expressed forgiveness towards those who had harmed them and used these individuals as his leitmotif.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=351}} The ANC's image was tarnished by the revelations that some of its activists had engaged in torture, attacks on civilians, and other human rights abuses. It sought to suppress part of the final TRC report, infuriating Tutu.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=157|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=366\u2013367|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3pp=531\u2013532}} He warned of the ANC's \"abuse of power\", stating that \"yesterday's oppressed can quite easily become today's oppressors...

He noted that whereas the latter was a quicker and more efficient way of exterminating whole populations, the National Party's policy of forcibly relocating black South Africans to areas where they lacked access to food and sanitation had much the same result.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=212}} In his words, \"Apartheid is as evil and as vicious as Nazism and Communism\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=84}}\n\nTutu never became anti-white, in part due to his many positive experiences with white people.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=129}} In his speeches, he stressed that it was apartheid\u2014rather than white people\u2014that was the enemy.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=68}} He promoted racial reconciliation between South Africa's communities, believing that most blacks fundamentally wanted to live in harmony with whites,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=80}} although he stressed that reconciliation would only be possible among equals, after blacks had been given full civil rights.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=100}} He tried to cultivate goodwill from the country's white community, making a point of showing white individuals gratitude when they made concessions to black demands.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=80}} He also spoke to many white audiences, urging them to support his cause, referring to it as the \"winning side\",{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=161|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=81}} and reminding them that when apartheid had been overthrown, black South Africans would remember who their friends had been.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=186}} When he held public prayers, he always included mention of those who upheld apartheid, such as politicians and police, alongside the system's victims, emphasising his view that all humans were the children of God.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=74}} He stated that \"the people who are perpetrators of injury in our land are not sporting horns or tails.

She has nurtured the deepest things in us blacks.\"{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=115}}\n\nHe became, according to Du Boulay, \"one of the most eloquent and persuasive communicators\" of black theology.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}} He expressed his views on theology largely through sermons and addresses rather than in extended academic treatises.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}}\nTutu expressed the view that Western theology sought answers to questions that Africans were not asking.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=135\u2013136}} For Tutu, two major questions were being posed by African Christianity: how to replace imported Christian expressions of faith with something authentically African, and how to liberate people from bondage.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=136}} He believed that there were many comparisons to be made between contemporary African understandings of God and those featured in the Old Testament.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=137}} He nevertheless criticised African theology for failing to sufficiently address contemporary societal problems, and suggested that to correct this it should learn from the black theology tradition.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=116}}\n\nWhen chairing the TRC, Tutu advocated an explicitly Christian model of reconciliation, as part of which he believed that South Africans had to face up to the damages that they had caused and accept the consequences of their actions.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}} As part of this, he believed that the perpetrators and beneficiaries of apartheid must admit to their actions but that the system's victims should respond generously, stating that it was a \"gospel imperative\" to forgive.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}} At the same time, he argued that those responsible had to display true repentance in the form of restitution.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\n[[File:Desmond tutu 20070607 2.jpg|thumb|Tutu at the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]], 2007]]\n\nGish noted that by the time of apartheid's fall, Tutu had attained \"worldwide respect\" for his \"uncompromising stand for justice and reconciliation and his unmatched integrity\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=148}} According to Allen, Tutu \"made a powerful and unique contribution to publicizing the antiapartheid struggle abroad\", particularly in the United States.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=233}} In the latter country, he was able to rise to prominence as a South African anti-apartheid activist because\u2014unlike Mandela and other members of the ANC\u2014he had no links to the South African Communist Party and thus was more acceptable to Americans amid the Cold War anti-communist sentiment of the period.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=253}} In the U.S., he was often compared to Martin Luther King, with the African-American civil rights activist [[Jesse Jackson]] referring to him as \"the Martin Luther King of South Africa\"; this was a comparison that Tutu was embarrassed by.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=198}}\nAfter the end of apartheid, Tutu became \"perhaps the world's most prominent religious leader advocating gay and lesbian rights\", according to Allen.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=372}} Ultimately, Allen thought that perhaps Tutu's \"greatest legacy\" was the fact that he gave \"to the world as it entered the twenty-first century an African model for expressing the nature of human community\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=396}}\n\nDuring Tutu's rise to notability during the 1970s and 1980s, responses to him were \"sharply polarized\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=201}} Noting that he was \"simultaneously loved and hated, honoured and vilified\",{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=170}} Du Boulay attributed his divisive reception to the fact that \"strong people evoke strong emotions\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=138}} Tutu gained much adulation from black journalists, inspired imprisoned anti-apartheid activists, and led to many black parents naming their children after him.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=201}} For many black South Africans, he was a respected religious leader and a symbol of black achievement.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=247}} By 1984 he was\u2014according to Gish\u2014\"the personification of the South African freedom struggle\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=103}} In 1988, Du Boulay described him as \"a spokesman for his people, a voice for the voiceless\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}}\n\nThe response he received from South Africa's white minority was more mixed. Most of those who criticised him were conservative whites who did not want a shift away from apartheid and white-minority rule.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=138|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=78}} Many of these whites were angered that he was calling for economic sanctions against South Africa and that he was warning that racial violence was impending.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=98}} Said whites often accused him of being a tool of the communists.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=236}} This hostility was exacerbated by the government's campaign to discredit Tutu and distort his image,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=97}} which included repeatedly misquoting him to present his statements out of context.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=263}} According to Du Boulay, the SABC and much of the white press went to \"extraordinary attempts to discredit him\", something that \"made it hard to know the man himself\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}} Allen noted that in 1984, Tutu was \"the black leader white South Africans most loved to hate\" and that this antipathy extended beyond supporters of the far-right government to liberals too.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=202}} The fact that he was \"an object of hate\" for many was something that deeply pained him.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=138}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Hated by many white South Africans for being too radical, he was also scorned by many black militants for being too moderate.\n| source=\u2014 On Tutu in the mid-1980s, by Steven D.
