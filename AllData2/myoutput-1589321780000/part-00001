It was intended to be the first fully [[3D computer graphics|3D]] ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' game and the first original ''Sonic'' game for the [[Sega Saturn]]. It built on past ''Sonic'' games while introducing elements to take ''Sonic'' into the [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|3D era of video games]]. The storyline followed [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] on his journey to stop [[Dr. Robotnik]] stealing six magic rings from Tiara Boobowski and her father.\n\n''X-treme'' was conceived as a [[side-scrolling]] platform game for the [[Sega Genesis]] to succeed ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]'' (1994). Development shifted to the [[32X]] and then the Saturn and [[Windows]], and the game was redesigned as a 3D platform game for the 1996 holiday season. The plan was disrupted by company politics, an unfavorable visit by [[Sega|Sega of Japan]] executives, and obstacles using a [[game engine]] developed by [[Sonic Team]] for another project. Staff illness made it impossible to finish ''X-treme'' on time, leading to its cancellation. A film tie-in with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] was also canceled.\n\nIn place of ''X-treme'', Sega released a [[Porting|port]] of the Genesis game ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'', but did not release an original 3D ''Sonic'' platform game until ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' for the [[Dreamcast]] in 1998. The cancellation is considered an important factor in the Saturn's [[list of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]], as it left the system with no original ''Sonic'' platform game. Elements similar to those in ''X-treme'' appeared in later games, such as ''[[Sonic Lost World]]'' (2013).\n\n== Premise ==\n[[Image:Sxtreme-jadegully.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A screenshot of Jade Gully Zone|\"Jade Gully Zone\" from Senn and Alon's engine (see [[Sonic X-treme#Game engines|Game engines]]), which used a fish-eye style view known as the \"Reflex Lens\"]]\n''X-treme'' was a [[platform game]] in which players controlled [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], with the ability to move in any direction.

It was intended to be the first fully [[3D computer graphics|3D]] ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' game and the first original ''Sonic'' game for the [[Sega Saturn]]. It built on past ''Sonic'' games while introducing elements to take ''Sonic'' into the [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|3D era of video games]]. The storyline followed [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] on his journey to stop [[Dr. Robotnik]] stealing six magic rings from Tiara Boobowski and her father.\n\n''X-treme'' was conceived as a [[side-scrolling]] platform game for the [[Sega Genesis]] to succeed ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]'' (1994). Development shifted to the [[32X]] and then the Saturn and [[Windows]], and the game was redesigned as a 3D platform game for the 1996 holiday season. The plan was disrupted by company politics, an unfavorable visit by [[Sega|Sega of Japan]] executives, and obstacles using a [[game engine]] developed by [[Sonic Team]] for another project. Staff illness made it impossible to finish ''X-treme'' on time, leading to its cancellation. A film tie-in with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] was also canceled.\n\nIn place of ''X-treme'', Sega released a [[Porting|port]] of the Genesis game ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'', but did not release an original 3D ''Sonic'' platform game until ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' for the [[Dreamcast]] in 1998. The cancellation is considered an important factor in the Saturn's [[list of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]], as it left the system with no original ''Sonic'' platform game. Elements similar to those in ''X-treme'' appeared in later games, such as ''[[Sonic Lost World]]'' (2013).\n\n== Premise ==\n[[Image:Sxtreme-jadegully.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A screenshot of Jade Gully Zone|\"Jade Gully Zone\" from Senn and Alon's engine (see [[Sonic X-treme#Game engines|Game engines]]), which used a fish-eye style view known as the \"Reflex Lens\"]]\n''X-treme'' was a [[platform game]] in which players controlled [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], with the ability to move in any direction.
