When the NIT started, it was considered the premiere national college basketball tournament and remained on par with the NCAA Tournament through the mid 1950s, until the NCAA began giving automatic bids to conference champions in 1956.<ref>Miller, Ralph (1990). \"Ralph Miller: Spanning the Game.\" Sagamore Publishing LLC. p. 56. {{ISBN|0915611384}}. \"Had the Aggies lost one, we would have been forced to have a playoff, and that was the problem. We had already accepted a bid to play in the [1954] National Invitation Tournament (NIT). The tournament picture was much different then. There was no announcement of NIT teams following the selection of the NCAA field as exists today. The reason was that the NIT was still considered a premier tournament.\"</ref> Western Kentucky's first eight appearances occurred during this early period, including their 2nd place finish in 1942, 3rd place in 1948, and 4th place in 1954.
