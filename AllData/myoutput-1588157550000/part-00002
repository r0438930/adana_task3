Versions 1 through to 7.4 were developed by FNS.  Satellite functionality was integrated into the Base Software in sub-versions from customer sites via the Redfern Projects Office.\n\nTwo major branches were developed using elements from version 2 through 4 of the core.  It was initially based on the AT&T NCR 9800 series mainframe architecture - creating a UNIX and an NT/Windows Server branch. The COBOL source code was interchangeable, but software interfacing with the OS, such as transaction queues, differed in order to handle the various implementations written in C and linked into the Microfocus COBOL runtime system-linked object. Scripting varied across branches to handle operations and non-functional requirements.\n\nMajor versions featured multi-currency (with spot positions) and multi-language functionality. To cater for this, various front-ends were created such as BTM (Branch Terminal Manager), Branch 2000 and BEAM-handled transactions from tellers.\n\nMajor version 6 included three back-end database technologies: Oracle, Informix and DB2.  The UNIX OS was implemented on HP-UX, IBM AIX and AT&T NCR System V UNIX variants.  ksh (Korn Shell) was the primary script language.\n\nVersion 7.5 and onward was developed in COBOL by the [[Tata Consultancy Services]] business unit TCS Financial Solutions.<ref>http://www.tcs.com/offerings/bancs/about_tcs/Pages/default.aspx</ref>\n\nIn August 2013, Panzhihua (PZH) Commercial Bank started using the software, making it the first Chinese city commercial bank to use the TCS BaNCS solution.<ref>http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/tcs-deploys-its-core-banking-solutions-for-chinese-bank/articleshow/21674694.cms</ref><ref>http://www.rttnews.com/2167790/tcs-deploys-bancs-solution-at-china-s-panzhihua-commercial-bank-in-record-time.aspx?type=in</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}<br />\n[[Category:Tata Consultancy Services]]\n\n<references responsive=\"0\" />\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Software\n| name = TCS BaNCS\n| logo = \n| screenshot = \n| caption = Turning our Technology to your Advantage\n| author = Financial Network Services\n| developer = [[Tata Consultancy Services]]\n| released = {{start date |1983}}\n| latest release version = 14.0\n| latest release date = {{Start date and age |2019}}\n| latest preview version = \n| latest preview date = \n| programming language = [[Java (programming language)|Java]]<ref>https://www.tcs.com/content/dam/tcs-bancs/protected-pdf/Global-Banking-Platform.pdf</ref>\n| operating system = [[Cross-platform]]\n| platform = \n| size = \n| language = \n| genre = [[Software for Banking, Capital Markets, Insurance]]\n| license = \n| website = https://www.tcs.com/bancs\n}}\n'''''TCS BaNCS''''' is a financial software solution suite developed by [[Tata Consultancy Services]] for Banking, Capital Markets and Insurance.
