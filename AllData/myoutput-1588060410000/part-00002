Over the next sixty years, this growing company became a manufacturer of optical lenses (including those for the first Canon cameras) and equipment used in cameras, binoculars, microscopes and inspection equipment. During [[World War II]] the company operated thirty factories with 2,000 employees, manufacturing binoculars, lenses, bomb sights, and periscopes for the Japanese military.\n\n===Reception outside Japan===\nAfter the war Nippon K\u014dgaku reverted to producing its civilian product range in a single factory.

For nearly 30 years, Nikon's F-series SLRs were the most widely used small-format cameras among professional photographers{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, as well as by the U.S. space program.\n\nNikon popularized many features in professional SLR photography{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, such as the modular camera system with interchangeable lenses, viewfinders, motor drives, and data backs; integrated light metering and lens indexing; electronic strobe flashguns instead of expendable flashbulbs; electronic shutter control; evaluative multi-zone \"matrix\" metering; and built-in motorized film advance. However, as [[auto focus]] SLRs became available from [[Minolta]] and others in the mid-1980s, Nikon's line of manual-focus cameras began to seem out of date{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.\n\nDespite introducing one of the first autofocus models, the slow and bulky F3AF, the company's determination to maintain lens compatibility with its F-mount prevented rapid advances in autofocus technology. [[Canon (company)|Canon]] introduced a new type of lens-camera interface with its entirely electronic [[Canon EOS]] cameras and [[Canon EF lens mount]] in 1987. The much faster lens performance permitted by Canon's electronic focusing and aperture control prompted many professional photographers (especially in sports and news) to switch to the Canon system through the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/hardwares/classics/eos/index.htm| title=Canon EOS Resources: SLR Cameras \u2013 Modern Classic SLR Series| accessdate=2010-02-05| publisher=Photography in Malaysia}}</ref>\n\n===Digital photography===\n[[File:Nikon Nasa F4 front with lenses.jpg|thumb|211px|right|[[Nikon NASA F4]] front view with DA-20 action finder, Electronics Box and lenses.

Although it used an [[APS-C]]-size light sensor only 2/3 the size of a 35&nbsp;mm film frame (later called a \"[[Nikon DX format|DX]] sensor\"), the D1 was among the first digital cameras to have sufficient image quality and a low enough price for some professionals (particularly photojournalists and sports photographers) to use it as a replacement for a film SLR. The company also has a [[Nikon Coolpix series|Coolpix]] line which grew as consumer digital photography became increasingly prevalent through the early 2000s.\n\nThrough the mid-2000s, Nikon's line of professional and enthusiast DSLRs and lenses including their back compatible AF-S lens line remained in second place behind Canon in SLR camera sales, and Canon had several years' lead in producing professional DSLRs with light sensors as large as traditional 35&nbsp;mm film frames.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/nikon-vs-canon.htm| title=Nikon vs. Canon| author=Ken Rockwell| accessdate=2010-02-05| publisher=Kenrockwell.com}}</ref> All Nikon DSLRs from 1999 to 2007, by contrast, used the smaller DX size sensor.\n\nThen, 2005 management changes at Nikon led to new camera designs such as the full-frame [[Nikon D3]] in late 2007, the [[Nikon D700]] a few months later, and mid-range SLRs. Nikon regained much of its reputation among professional and amateur enthusiast photographers as a leading innovator in the field, especially because of the speed, ergonomics, and low-light performance of its latest models.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/cameras/700-thoughts.shtml| title=Some Initial Thoughts on The Nikon D700| date=2008-07-02| accessdate=2010-02-05| publisher=Luminous Landscape}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2009}} The mid-range [[Nikon D90]], introduced in 2008, was also the first SLR camera to record video.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dpreview.com/news/0808/08082702nikond90previewed.asp| title=Nikon D90 plus hands-on preview| date=2008-08-27| accessdate=2010-02-05| publisher=Digital Photography Review}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nikon.com/about/news/2008/0827_d90_01.htm| title=Digital SLR Camera Nikon D90| date=2008-08-27| accessdate=2010-02-05| publisher=Nikon Corporation| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131113516/http://nikon.com/about/news/2008/0827_d90_01.htm| archivedate=2010-01-31}}</ref> Since then video mode has been introduced to many more of the Nikon DSLR cameras including the [[Nikon D3S]], [[Nikon D7000]], [[Nikon D5100]], [[Nikon D3100]], [[Nikon D3200]] and [[Nikon D5100]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://en.nikon.ca/Nikon-Products/Product-Archive/Digital-SLR-Cameras/25466/D3S.html| title=Nikon Products D3S| publisher=Nikon Canada}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://en.nikon.ca/Nikon-Products/Product/Digital-SLR-Cameras/25468/D7000.html| title=Nikon Products D7000| publisher=Nikon Canada}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://en.nikon.ca/Nikon-Products/Product/Digital-SLR-Cameras/25478/D5100.html| title=Nikon Products D5100| publisher=Nikon Canada}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://en.nikon.ca/Nikon-Products/Product/Digital-SLR-Cameras/33851/D3100.html| title=Nikon Products D3100| publisher=Nikon Canada}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://en.nikon.ca/Nikon-Products/Product/Digital-SLR-Cameras/25492/D3200.html| title=Nikon Products D3200| publisher=Nikon Canada}}</ref>\nMore recently, Nikon has released a photograph and video editing suite called '''ViewNX''' to browse, edit, merge and share images and videos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikonusa.com/Nikon-Products/Product/Imaging-Software/NVNX/ViewNX.html|title=ViewNX|website=nikonusa.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/software/viewnx2/|title=Nikon \u2013 Imaging Products \u2013 ViewNX 2|publisher=Nikon Corpation|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dpreview.com/news/2010/8/17/nikoncapturenx2|title=Nikon releases ViewNX 2 software|publisher=DP Review|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Film camera production===\nOnce Nikon introduced affordable consumer-level DSLRs such as the [[Nikon D70]] in the mid-2000s, sales of its consumer and professional film cameras fell rapidly, following the general trend in the industry. In January 2006, Nikon announced it would stop making most of its film camera models and all of its large format lenses, and focus on digital models.<ref name='nikon_pr_2006_01'>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikon.co.uk/press_room/releases/show.aspx?rid=201|title=Nikon prepares to strengthen digital line-up for 2006|last=Nikon UK|date=2006-01-11|accessdate=2019-05-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617102306/http://www.nikon.co.uk/press_room/releases/show.aspx?rid=201|archivedate=2011-06-17|quote=[Nikon] will continue to manufacturer ''[sic]'' and sell the F6, our flagship film model [..] Sales of the manual FM10 will also continue outside Europe.

The R10 and R8 SUPER ZOOM Super 8 models (introduced in 1973) were the top of the line and last attempt for the amateur movie field. The cameras had a special gate and claw system to improve image steadiness and overcome a major drawback of Super 8 cartridge design. The R10 model has a high speed 10X macro zoom lens.\n\nContrary to other brands, Nikon never attempted to offer projectors or their accessories.\n\n===Thai operations===\nNikon has shifted much of its manufacturing facilities to [[Thailand]], with some production (especially of Coolpix cameras and some low-end lenses) in [[Indonesia]]. The company constructed a factory in [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayuthaya]] north of [[Bangkok]] in Thailand in 1991. By the year 2000, it had 2,000 employees. Steady growth over the next few years and an increase of floor space from the original 19,400 square meters (208,827 square feet) to 46,200 square meters (497,300 square feet) enabled the factory to produce a wider range of Nikon products. By 2004, it had more than 8,000 workers.\n\nThe range of the products produced at Nikon Thailand include plastic molding, optical parts, [[painting]], [[printing]], metal processing, [[plating]], spherical lens process, [[aspherical lens]] process, [[prism (optics)|prism]] process, electrical and electronic mounting process, [[silent wave motor]] and [[autofocus]] unit production.\n\nAs of 2009, all of Nikon's [[Nikon DX format]] [[DSLR]] cameras and the [[Nikon D600|D600]], a [[prosumer]] FX camera, are produced in Thailand, while their professional and semi-professional [[Nikon FX format]] (full frame) cameras ([[Nikon D700|D700]], [[Nikon D3|D3]], [[Nikon D3S|D3S]], [[Nikon D3X|D3X]], [[Nikon D4|D4]], [[Nikon D800|D800]] and the retro-styled [[Nikon Df|Df]]) are built in Japan, in the city of [[Sendai]]. The Thai facility also produces most of Nikon's digital \"DX\" zoom lenses, as well as numerous other lenses in the Nikkor line.\n\n===Cultural activities===\n[[File:Nikon-tokyo-large.jpg|thumb|Inside the Nikon Salon]]\nIn Japan, Nikon runs the [[Nikon Salon]] exhibition spaces, runs the Nikkor Club for amateur photographers (to whom it distributes the series of Nikon Salon books), and arranges the [[Ina Nobuo Award]], [[Miki Jun Award]] and [[Miki Jun Inspiration Award]]s.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nAs of November 19, 2013, Nikon is the \"Official Camera\" of [[Walt Disney World|Walt Disney World Resort]] and [[Disneyland Resort]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nikon-and-walt-disney-world-and-disneyland-resorts-team-up-to-capture-magical-photo-moments-232507051.html|title=Nikon And Walt Disney World And Disneyland Resorts Team Up To Capture Magical Photo Moments|first=Nikon|last=Inc.|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nNikon is the official co-sponsor of [[Galatasaray S.K.

Nikon first started by naming the cameras with a series name (like the L35/L135-series, the RF/RD-series, the W35-series, the EF or the AW-series). In later production cycles, the cameras were double branded with a series-name on the one and a sales name on the other hand. Sales names were for example ''Zoom-Touch'' for cameras with a wide zoom range, ''Lite-Touch'' for ultra compact models, ''Fun-Touch'' for easy to use cameras and ''Sport-Touch'' for splash water resistance. After the late 1990s, Nikon dropped the series names and continued only with the sales name. Nikon's APS-cameras were all named ''Nuvis''.\n\nThe cameras came in all price ranges from entry-level fixed-lens-cameras to the top model Nikon 35Ti and 28Ti with titanium body and 3D-Matrix-Metering.\n\n===Movie cameras===\n: '''Double 8 (8mm)'''\n* NIKKOREX 8 (1960)\n* NIKKOREX 8F (1963)\n: '''Super 8'''\n* Nikon Super Zoom 8 (1966)\n* Nikon 8X Super Zoom (1967)\n* Nikon R8 Super Zoom (1973)\n* Nikon R10 Super Zoom (1973)\n\n===Professional Underwater cameras===\n{{main|Nikonos}}\n* [[Nikonos]] I [[Calypso (camera)|Calypso]] (1963, originally known in France as the Calypso/Nikkor)\n* Nikonos II (1968)\n* Nikonos III (1975)\n* Nikonos IV-A (1980)\n* Nikonos V (1984)\n* Nikonos RS (1992)<ref>[http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/nikon/htmls/models/htmls/nikonos.htm Nikonos underwater camera models].

Prior to the development of 'cool' LED lighting this scanner used a halogen lamp (hence the name 'Coolscan' for the following models). The resolution of the following LED based Coolscan model didn't increase but the price was significantly lower. Colour depth, scan quality, imaging and hardware functionality as well as scanning speed was gradually improved with each following model. The final 'top of the line' 35mm Coolscan LS-5000 ED was a device capable of archiving greater numbers of slides; 50 framed slides or 40 images on film roll. It could scan all these in one batch using special adapters. A single maximum resolution scan was performed in no more than 20 seconds as long as no post-processing was also performed. With the launch of the Coolscan 9000 ED Nikon introduced its most up-to-date film scanner which, like the Minolta Dimage scanners were the only film scanners that, due to a special version of [[Digital ICE]], were able to scan [[Kodachrome]] film reliably both dust and scratch free. In late 2007 much of the software's code had to be rewritten to make it Mac OS 10.5 compatible. The choice of a DSLR directly affects the type of lenses being used, this is the first crucial step. Lenses often end up being the constant investment over time regarding photography equipment, with camera bodies fluctuating more quickly. A pentamirror viewfinder, as opposed to a pentaprism and a smaller array of physical dials and buttons on the top and rear plates. A larger and faster body is most beneficial for a more compact design. Each camera has several autofocus points arranged across the sensor.<ref>{{cite web| title=DSLR Camera| url=https://bestviewsreviews.com/slr-cameras/ |publisher=Best Views Reviews |access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref> Third-party software solutions like SilverFast or [[Vuescan]] provide alternatives to the official Nikon drivers and scanning software, and maintain updated drivers for most current operating systems. Between 1994 and 1996 Nikon developed three [[Image scanner#Flatbed|flatbed scanner]] models named Scantouch, which couldn't keep up with competitive flatbed products and were hence discontinued to allow Nikon to focus on its dedicated film scanners.\n\n==Sport optics==\n\n===Binoculars===\n{{colbegin|colwidth=18em}}\n* Sprint IV\n* Sportstar IV\n* Travelite V\n* Travelite VI\n* Travelite EX\n* Mikron\n* Action VII\n* Action VII Zoom\n* Aculon\n* Action EX\n* Sporter I\n* Venturer 8/10x32\n* Venturer 8x42\n* Prostaff 5\n* Prostaff 7\n* Monarch ATB\n* Monarch 3\n* Monarch 5\n* Monarch 7\n* StabilEyes\n* Superior E\n* Marine\n* EDG II\n{{colend}}\n\n===Spotting scopes===\n{{colbegin|colwidth=18em}}\n* Prostaff 3 16-48x60\n* Prostaff 5 60\n* Prostaff 5 80\n* Spotter XL II WP\n* Spotting Scope R/A II\n* Spotting Scope 80\n* Fieldscope 60mm\n* Fieldscope ED78/ EDII\n* Fieldscope III/EDIII\n* Fieldscope ED82\n* Fieldscope ED50\n* Fieldscopes EDG 65 /85\n* Fieldscope EDG 85 VR\n{{colend}}\n\n===Rifle scopes===\n{{colbegin|colwidth=18em}}\n* BLACK\n* Monarch 7\n* Monarch 5\n* Monarch 3\n* Monarch\n* Laser IRT\n* Prostaff 5\n* Encore\n* Coyote Special\n* Slughunter\n* Inline\n* Buckmaster II\n* Buckmaster\n* AR\n* ProStaff II\n* Prostaff\n* Team REALTREE\n* Rimfire\n* Handgun\n{{colend}}\n\n==Nikon Metrology==\n'''Overview'''\n\nNikon [[Metrology]], a division of Nikon, produces hardware and software products for 2D & 3D measurement from nano to large scale measurement volumes.  Products include Optical Laser Probes, [[X-ray computed tomography]], [[Coordinate-measuring machine]] (CMM),Laser Radar Systems (LR), Microscopes, Portable CMMs, Large Volume Metrology, Motion Measurement and Adaptive Robotic Controls, Semiconductor Systems, Metrology Software including CMM-Manager, CAMIO Studio, Inspect-X, Focus, and Automeasure.  Measurements are performed using tactile and non-contact probes, measurement data is collected in software and processed for comparison to nominal CAD ([[Computer-aided design]]) or part specification or for recreating / [[reverse engineering]] physical work pieces.\n\n'''Nikon Metrology Origins'''\n\nThe origins of Nikon go back to 1917 when three Jananese optical manufacturers joined to form Nippon Kogaku KK ('Japan Optics').  In 1925 the microscope having revolving nosepiece and interchangeable objectives was produced.  Significant growth for the microscopy division occurs over the next 50 years as Nikon pioneers development of polarising and stereo microscopes along with new products for measuring and inspection (Metrology) markets.  These new products include devices targeted for industrial use such as optical comparators, autocollimators, profile projector and automated vision based systems.

However, as [[auto focus]] SLRs became available from [[Minolta]] and others in the mid-1980s, Nikon's line of manual-focus cameras began to seem out of date{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.\n\nDespite introducing one of the first autofocus models, the slow and bulky F3AF, the company's determination to maintain lens compatibility with its F-mount prevented rapid advances in autofocus technology. [[Canon (company)|Canon]] introduced a new type of lens-camera interface with its entirely electronic [[Canon EOS]] cameras and [[Canon EF lens mount]] in 1987.

Although it used an [[APS-C]]-size light sensor only 2/3 the size of a 35&nbsp;mm film frame (later called a \"[[Nikon DX format|DX]] sensor\"), the D1 was among the first digital cameras to have sufficient image quality and a low enough price for some professionals (particularly photojournalists and sports photographers) to use it as a replacement for a film SLR. The company also has a [[Nikon Coolpix series|Coolpix]] line which grew as consumer digital photography became increasingly prevalent through the early 2000s.\n\nThrough the mid-2000s, Nikon's line of professional and enthusiast DSLRs and lenses including their back compatible AF-S lens line remained in second place behind Canon in SLR camera sales, and Canon had several years' lead in producing professional DSLRs with light sensors as large as traditional 35&nbsp;mm film frames.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/nikon-vs-canon.htm| title=Nikon vs. Canon| author=Ken Rockwell| accessdate=2010-02-05| publisher=Kenrockwell.com}}</ref> All Nikon DSLRs from 1999 to 2007, by contrast, used the smaller DX size sensor.\n\nThen, 2005 management changes at Nikon led to new camera designs such as the full-frame [[Nikon D3]] in late 2007, the [[Nikon D700]] a few months later, and mid-range SLRs.

In January 2006, Nikon announced it would stop making most of its film camera models and all of its large format lenses, and focus on digital models.<ref name='nikon_pr_2006_01'>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikon.co.uk/press_room/releases/show.aspx?rid=201|title=Nikon prepares to strengthen digital line-up for 2006|last=Nikon UK|date=2006-01-11|accessdate=2019-05-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617102306/http://www.nikon.co.uk/press_room/releases/show.aspx?rid=201|archivedate=2011-06-17|quote=[Nikon] will continue to manufacturer ''[sic]'' and sell the F6, our flagship film model [..] Sales of the manual FM10 will also continue outside Europe.

The R10 and R8 SUPER ZOOM Super 8 models (introduced in 1973) were the top of the line and last attempt for the amateur movie field. The cameras had a special gate and claw system to improve image steadiness and overcome a major drawback of Super 8 cartridge design. The R10 model has a high speed 10X macro zoom lens.\n\nContrary to other brands, Nikon never attempted to offer projectors or their accessories.\n\n===Thai operations===\nNikon has shifted much of its manufacturing facilities to [[Thailand]], with some production (especially of Coolpix cameras and some low-end lenses) in [[Indonesia]]. The company constructed a factory in [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayuthaya]] north of [[Bangkok]] in Thailand in 1991. By the year 2000, it had 2,000 employees. Steady growth over the next few years and an increase of floor space from the original 19,400 square meters (208,827 square feet) to 46,200 square meters (497,300 square feet) enabled the factory to produce a wider range of Nikon products. By 2004, it had more than 8,000 workers.\n\nThe range of the products produced at Nikon Thailand include plastic molding, optical parts, [[painting]], [[printing]], metal processing, [[plating]], spherical lens process, [[aspherical lens]] process, [[prism (optics)|prism]] process, electrical and electronic mounting process, [[silent wave motor]] and [[autofocus]] unit production.\n\nAs of 2009, all of Nikon's [[Nikon DX format]] [[DSLR]] cameras and the [[Nikon D600|D600]], a [[prosumer]] FX camera, are produced in Thailand, while their professional and semi-professional [[Nikon FX format]] (full frame) cameras ([[Nikon D700|D700]], [[Nikon D3|D3]], [[Nikon D3S|D3S]], [[Nikon D3X|D3X]], [[Nikon D4|D4]], [[Nikon D800|D800]] and the retro-styled [[Nikon Df|Df]]) are built in Japan, in the city of [[Sendai]]. The Thai facility also produces most of Nikon's digital \"DX\" zoom lenses, as well as numerous other lenses in the Nikkor line.\n\n===Cultural activities===\n[[File:Nikon-tokyo-large.jpg|thumb|Inside the Nikon Salon]]\nIn Japan, Nikon runs the [[Nikon Salon]] exhibition spaces, runs the Nikkor Club for amateur photographers (to whom it distributes the series of Nikon Salon books), and arranges the [[Ina Nobuo Award]], [[Miki Jun Award]] and [[Miki Jun Inspiration Award]]s.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nAs of November 19, 2013, Nikon is the \"Official Camera\" of [[Walt Disney World|Walt Disney World Resort]] and [[Disneyland Resort]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nikon-and-walt-disney-world-and-disneyland-resorts-team-up-to-capture-magical-photo-moments-232507051.html|title=Nikon And Walt Disney World And Disneyland Resorts Team Up To Capture Magical Photo Moments|first=Nikon|last=Inc.|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nNikon is the official co-sponsor of [[Galatasaray S.K.

Nikon first started by naming the cameras with a series name (like the L35/L135-series, the RF/RD-series, the W35-series, the EF or the AW-series). In later production cycles, the cameras were double branded with a series-name on the one and a sales name on the other hand. Sales names were for example ''Zoom-Touch'' for cameras with a wide zoom range, ''Lite-Touch'' for ultra compact models, ''Fun-Touch'' for easy to use cameras and ''Sport-Touch'' for splash water resistance. After the late 1990s, Nikon dropped the series names and continued only with the sales name. Nikon's APS-cameras were all named ''Nuvis''.\n\nThe cameras came in all price ranges from entry-level fixed-lens-cameras to the top model Nikon 35Ti and 28Ti with titanium body and 3D-Matrix-Metering.\n\n===Movie cameras===\n: '''Double 8 (8mm)'''\n* NIKKOREX 8 (1960)\n* NIKKOREX 8F (1963)\n: '''Super 8'''\n* Nikon Super Zoom 8 (1966)\n* Nikon 8X Super Zoom (1967)\n* Nikon R8 Super Zoom (1973)\n* Nikon R10 Super Zoom (1973)\n\n===Professional Underwater cameras===\n{{main|Nikonos}}\n* [[Nikonos]] I [[Calypso (camera)|Calypso]] (1963, originally known in France as the Calypso/Nikkor)\n* Nikonos II (1968)\n* Nikonos III (1975)\n* Nikonos IV-A (1980)\n* Nikonos V (1984)\n* Nikonos RS (1992)<ref>[http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/nikon/htmls/models/htmls/nikonos.htm Nikonos underwater camera models].

Prior to the development of 'cool' LED lighting this scanner used a halogen lamp (hence the name 'Coolscan' for the following models). The resolution of the following LED based Coolscan model didn't increase but the price was significantly lower. Colour depth, scan quality, imaging and hardware functionality as well as scanning speed was gradually improved with each following model. The final 'top of the line' 35mm Coolscan LS-5000 ED was a device capable of archiving greater numbers of slides; 50 framed slides or 40 images on film roll. It could scan all these in one batch using special adapters. A single maximum resolution scan was performed in no more than 20 seconds as long as no post-processing was also performed. With the launch of the Coolscan 9000 ED Nikon introduced its most up-to-date film scanner which, like the Minolta Dimage scanners were the only film scanners that, due to a special version of [[Digital ICE]], were able to scan [[Kodachrome]] film reliably both dust and scratch free. In late 2007 much of the software's code had to be rewritten to make it Mac OS 10.5 compatible. The choice of a DSLR directly affects the type of lenses being used, this is the first crucial step. Lenses often end up being the constant investment over time regarding photography equipment, with camera bodies fluctuating more quickly. A pentamirror viewfinder, as opposed to a pentaprism and a smaller array of physical dials and buttons on the top and rear plates. A larger and faster body is most beneficial for a more compact design. Each camera has several autofocus points arranged across the sensor.<ref>{{cite web| title=DSLR Camera| url=https://bestviewsreviews.com/slr-cameras/ |publisher=Best Views Reviews |access-date=2020-28-04}}</ref> Third-party software solutions like SilverFast or [[Vuescan]] provide alternatives to the official Nikon drivers and scanning software, and maintain updated drivers for most current operating systems. Between 1994 and 1996 Nikon developed three [[Image scanner#Flatbed|flatbed scanner]] models named Scantouch, which couldn't keep up with competitive flatbed products and were hence discontinued to allow Nikon to focus on its dedicated film scanners.\n\n==Sport optics==\n\n===Binoculars===\n{{colbegin|colwidth=18em}}\n* Sprint IV\n* Sportstar IV\n* Travelite V\n* Travelite VI\n* Travelite EX\n* Mikron\n* Action VII\n* Action VII Zoom\n* Aculon\n* Action EX\n* Sporter I\n* Venturer 8/10x32\n* Venturer 8x42\n* Prostaff 5\n* Prostaff 7\n* Monarch ATB\n* Monarch 3\n* Monarch 5\n* Monarch 7\n* StabilEyes\n* Superior E\n* Marine\n* EDG II\n{{colend}}\n\n===Spotting scopes===\n{{colbegin|colwidth=18em}}\n* Prostaff 3 16-48x60\n* Prostaff 5 60\n* Prostaff 5 80\n* Spotter XL II WP\n* Spotting Scope R/A II\n* Spotting Scope 80\n* Fieldscope 60mm\n* Fieldscope ED78/ EDII\n* Fieldscope III/EDIII\n* Fieldscope ED82\n* Fieldscope ED50\n* Fieldscopes EDG 65 /85\n* Fieldscope EDG 85 VR\n{{colend}}\n\n===Rifle scopes===\n{{colbegin|colwidth=18em}}\n* BLACK\n* Monarch 7\n* Monarch 5\n* Monarch 3\n* Monarch\n* Laser IRT\n* Prostaff 5\n* Encore\n* Coyote Special\n* Slughunter\n* Inline\n* Buckmaster II\n* Buckmaster\n* AR\n* ProStaff II\n* Prostaff\n* Team REALTREE\n* Rimfire\n* Handgun\n{{colend}}\n\n==Nikon Metrology==\n'''Overview'''\n\nNikon [[Metrology]], a division of Nikon, produces hardware and software products for 2D & 3D measurement from nano to large scale measurement volumes.  Products include Optical Laser Probes, [[X-ray computed tomography]], [[Coordinate-measuring machine]] (CMM),Laser Radar Systems (LR), Microscopes, Portable CMMs, Large Volume Metrology, Motion Measurement and Adaptive Robotic Controls, Semiconductor Systems, Metrology Software including CMM-Manager, CAMIO Studio, Inspect-X, Focus, and Automeasure.  Measurements are performed using tactile and non-contact probes, measurement data is collected in software and processed for comparison to nominal CAD ([[Computer-aided design]]) or part specification or for recreating / [[reverse engineering]] physical work pieces.\n\n'''Nikon Metrology Origins'''\n\nThe origins of Nikon go back to 1917 when three Jananese optical manufacturers joined to form Nippon Kogaku KK ('Japan Optics').  In 1925 the microscope having revolving nosepiece and interchangeable objectives was produced.  Significant growth for the microscopy division occurs over the next 50 years as Nikon pioneers development of polarising and stereo microscopes along with new products for measuring and inspection (Metrology) markets.  These new products include devices targeted for industrial use such as optical comparators, autocollimators, profile projector and automated vision based systems.  Continued effort through the next three decades yield the release of products including the Optiphot and Labophot microscopes, Diaphot microscope, the Eclipse range of infinity optics, and finally the DS camera series and the Coolscope with the advent of digital sensors.  With the acquisition of Metris in 2009 the Nikon Metrology division was born.  Nikon Metrology products include a full range of both 2D & 3D, optical, tactile, non-contact, and X-Ray Metrology solutions ranging from nanometer resolution on microscopic samples to \u03bcm resolution in volumes large enough to house a commercial airliner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nikonmetrology.com/en-us/about-us/history-of-nikon-metrology|title=History of Nikon Metrology|last=|first=|date=|website=Nikon Metrology|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Nikon Metrology Products'''\n* Coordinate-Measuring-Machines\n** Bridge, Gantry and Horizontal Arm CMMs\n** Digital / Analog Tactile and / or Non-Contact Optical sensors\n* Portable arms \u2013 6 and 7 axis models\n* Laser Scanning \u2013 Optical Line Scanners in single Line and Multi-line (Cross Scanner) configurations\n* X-ray-and-CT-Inspection<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nikon.com/products/industrial-metrology/lineup/xray_ct/|title=X-ray and CT Inspections|last=|first=|date=|website=Nikon|access-date=}}</ref>\n* Video-Microscope-Measuring \u2013 Optical Probe and Multi-Sensor options available\n* Microscope-Systems\n* Large Volume Systems<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nikon.com/products/industrial-metrology/lineup/large_volume/|title=Large Volume Inspection|last=|first=|date=|website=Nikon|access-date=}}</ref>\n* Application Software \u2013 several options available depending on specific application and hardware.\n** CMM-Manager \u2013 Multi-sensor 3D Metrology software for third party CMMs, Articulated Arms, and Nikon video-measurement systems<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmmmanager.com/|title=CMM-Manager website|last=|first=|date=|website=CMM-Manager|access-date=}}</ref>\n** Automeasure, NIS Elements, E-Max, Automeasure Eyes \u2013 2D / 3D imaging software for use on Nikon video-measurement systems<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nikon.com/products/industrial-metrology/lineup/nexiv/accessory/soft/|title=Software for CNC Video Measuring Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=Nikon|access-date=}}</ref>\n** Focus, CMM-Manager, CAMIO \u2013 Software for 3D Metrology<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nikon.com/products/industrial-metrology/lineup/3d_metrology/software/|title=Software for 3D Metrology|last=|first=|date=|website=Nikon|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Other products==\nNikon also manufactures [[ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] equipment, [[loupe]]s, [[monocular]]s, [[binoculars|binocular telescopes]], [[microscope]]s, laser rangefinders,<ref>{{cite web|title=Nikon Laser Rangefinder|url=https://justrangefinder.com/nikon-8397-aculon-laser-rangefinder-review/|date=27 September 2016}}</ref> cameras for microscopy, optical and [[video]]-based [[measurement]] equipment, scanners and [[stepper]]s for the manufacture of [[integrated circuit]]s and [[liquid crystal display]]s, and [[semiconductor device]] inspection equipment.
