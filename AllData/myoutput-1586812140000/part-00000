His parents were Rodolfo Zedillo Castillo, a mechanic, and Martha Alicia Ponce de Le\u00f3n. Seeking better job and education opportunities for their children, his parents moved to [[Mexicali]], [[Baja California]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn 1965, at the age of 14, he returned to Mexico City. In 1969 he entered the [[Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional|National Polytechnic Institute]], financing his studies by working in the National Army and Navy Bank (later known as ''Banj\u00e9rcito''). He graduated as an economist in 1972 and began lecturing.

His doctoral thesis was titled ''Mexico's Public External Debt: Recent History and Future Growth Related to Oil''.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Political career===\nZedillo began working in the [[Bank of Mexico]] (Mexico's central bank) as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, where he supported the adoption of macroeconomic policies for the country's improvement.\nBy 1987, he was named deputy-secretary of Planning and Budget Control in the Secretariat of Budget and Planning. In 1988, at the age of 36, he headed that secretariat. During his term as Secretary, Zedillo launched a Science and Technology reform.\n\nIn 1992, he was appointed [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretary of Education]] by president [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Carlos Salinas]].  During his tenure in this post, he was in charge of the revision the Mexican public school textbooks.  The changes, which took a softer line on foreign investment and the Porfiriato, among other topics, were highly controversial and the textbooks were withdrawn.<ref>Gilbert, Dennis. \u201cRewriting History: Salinas, Zedillo and the 1992 Textbook Controversy.\u201d Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos, vol. 13, no. 2, 1997, pp. 271\u2013297. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1052017 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> A year later he resigned to run the electoral campaign of [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]], the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]]'s presidential candidate.\n\n==1994 presidential campaign==\n{{main|1994 Mexican general election}}\n[[File:Vladimir Putin at the Millennium Summit 6-8 September 2000-12.jpg|left|thumb|230px|[[Vladimir Putin]] and Ernesto Zedillo, at the Millennium Summit, 2000]]\n\nIn 1994, after [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]]'s assassination, Zedillo became one of the few [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] members eligible under Mexican law to take his place, since he had not occupied public office for some time.\n\nThe opposition blamed Colosio's murder on Salinas. Although the PRI's presidential candidates were always chosen by the current president, and thus [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]] had originally been [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Salinas]]' candidate, their political relationship had been affected by a famous speech during the campaign in which Colosio said that [[Mexico]] had many problems. It is also notable that the assassination took place after Colosio visited the members of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista movement]] in Chiapas and promised to open dialogue, something the PRI opposed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nAfter Colosio's murder, this speech was seen as the main cause of his break with the president.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The choice of Zedillo was interpreted as Salinas' way of bypassing the strong Mexican political tradition of non-reelection and retaining real power, since Zedillo was not really a politician, but an economist (like Salinas), who clearly lacked the president's political talent and influence. It is unclear if Salinas had attempted to control Colosio, who was generally considered at that time to be a far better candidate.\n\nZedillo ran against [[Diego Fern\u00e1ndez de Cevallos]] of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] and second-timer [[Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas]] of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]]. He won with 48.69% of popular vote, and became the last president to distinguish the 70-year PRI dynasty in M\u00e9xico during the 20th century.\n\n==Presidency (1994\u20132000)==\n[[File:Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2009.jpg|right|thumb|230px| Zedillo at the World Economic Forum 2009]]\n[[File:Edmund S Phelps Ernesto Zedillo.jpg|right|thumb|230 px|Ernesto Zedillo with [[Edmund Phelps]], winner of the 2006 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], at the [[World Economic Forum]]'s Summit on the Global Agenda 2008]]\nAt age 43, Zedillo assumed the presidency on 1 December 1994 at the [[Legislative Palace of San L\u00e1zaro]], taking oath before the [[Congress of the Union]] presided by the [[President of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|deputy president]] Carlota Vargas Garza. Zedillo's electoral victory was perceived as clean, but he came to office as an accidental candidate with no political base of his own and no experience. During the first part of his presidency, he took inconsistent policy positions and there were rumors that he would resign or that there would be a coup d'\u00e9tat against him, which caused turmoil in financial markets.<ref name=\"Thomas Legler 1997\">Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p.1641</ref>\n\n===Cabinet===\nZedillo's [[Cabinet of Ernesto Zedillo|cabinet]] needed to have members who could deal with crises. Over the course of his presidency, he had four as [[Minister of the Interior]], [[Esteban Moctezuma]], who dealt with the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]]; [[Emilio Chuayffet]], who resigned following the [[Acteal massacre]]; [[Francisco Labastida]], who won the primary to determine the 2000 PRI presidential candidate; and [[Di\u00f3doro Carrasco Altamirano]], who dealt with the strike at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].\n\n===Financial Crisis of December 1994===\n{{Main|Mexican peso crisis}}\nA few days after taking office, one of the biggest economic crisis in Mexican history hit the country. Although it was outgoing President Salinas who was mainly blamed for the crisis, Salinas claimed that President Zedillo made a mistake by changing the economic policies held by his administration. Zedillo devalued the peso by 15%, which prompted the near-collapse of the financial system.<ref>Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\", p. 1641.</ref> [[Mexican peso crisis|The crisis]] ended after a series of reforms and actions led by Zedillo. US president [[Bill Clinton]] granted a US$20&nbsp;billion loan to Mexico, which helped in one of Zedillo's initiatives to rescue the banking system.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-authorizes-loan-to-mexico | title = Clinton authorizes loan to Mexico | publisher = [[History (U.S. TV channel)]] | date = 31 January 1995 | accessdate = 27 January 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180324010125/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-authorizes-loan-to-mexico | archive-date = 24 March 2018 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n===Break with Salinas===\nZedillo had been an accidental presidential candidate who was vaulted to prominence with the assassination of Colosio. The conflict between Zedillo and Salinas marked the early part of Zedillo's presidency.<ref>Fuentes, Carlos. \u201cCoalticue's Skirt: Hidden Aspects of Mexico's Political Rivalry in 1995.\u201d The Brown Journal of World Affairs, vol. 2, no. 2, 1995, pp. 175\u2013180. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/24590093 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> As with De la Madrid and Salinas, Zedillo had never been elected to office and had no experience in politics. His performance as a candidate was lackluster, but the outbreak of violence in Chiapas and the shock of the Colosio assassination swayed voters to support the PRI candidate in the 1994 election. In office, Zedillo was perceived as a puppet-president with Salinas following the model of [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] in the wake of the 1928 assassination of president-elect [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]]. In order to consolidate his own power in the presidency, Zedillo had to assert his independence from Salinas. On 28 February 1995 Zedillo ordered the arrest of the ex-president's older brother [[Ra\u00fal Salinas]] for the September 1994 murder of PRI General Secretary [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu]]  marked a decisive break between Zedillo and Salinas.<ref name=\"Thomas Legler 1997\"/>\n\n===Zapatista Crisis===\n{{Main|1995 Zapatista Crisis}}\nMexico had been in turmoil since January 1994, with the initial Zapatista rebellion and two political assassinations. The presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]] of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] was assassinated in March 1994, and his campaign manager Ernesto Zedillo replaced him candidate a few days later. The other high-profile assassination, that of PRI Secretary General [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu]], brother-in-law of President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] in September 1994, laid bare political rivalries within the PRI. In order to give credibility to the investigations of those political crimes and grant \"a healthy distance\", president Zedillo appointed Antonio Lozano Gracia a member of the opposition Political Party [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] as [[Attorney General of Mexico]].  Zedillo inherited the rebellion in Chiapas, but it was up to his administration to handle it.\n\nOn 5 January 1995, the Secretary of Interior [[Esteban Moctezuma]] started a secret meeting process with [[Subcomandante Marcos|Marcos]] called \"Steps Toward Peace\" [[Chiapas]]. Talks seemed promising for an agreement, but Zedillo backed away, apparently because the military was not in accord with the government's apparent \"acceptance of the Zapatistas' control over much of Chiapas territory.\"<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', p. 242.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=330331|title=Zedillo rompi\u00f3 acuerdo de paz con el EZLN: Esteban Moctezuma - Proceso|date=11 January 2013|website=Proceso.com.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2013/01/62462.php|title=El Universal - Opinion - Renuncia en Gobernaci\u00f3n|website=Eluniversalmas.com.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802123734/http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2013/01/62462.php|archive-date=2 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In February 1995, the Mexican government identified the masked Subcomandante Marcos as Rafael Sebasti\u00e1n Guill\u00e9n, a former professor at the [[Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana]] in Mexico City.

The army was prepared to move against Zapatista strongholds and capture Marcos.<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', pp. 244-45</ref> The government decided to reopen negotiations with the Zapatistas.

He created the poverty alleviation program ''Progresa'', which subsidized the poorest families in Mexico, provided that their children went to school. It replaced the Salinas administration's PRONASOL, deemed too politicized.<ref>Rocha Menocal, A. (2001). \"Do Old Habits Die Hard?

The Mexican economy suffered following the December 1994 peso crisis, when currency was devalued by 15% and the U.S. intervened to prop up the economy with a multi-billion dollar loan, so that NAFTA under the Zedillo administration got off to a rocky start.  The Mexican GDP was -7% and there were hopes that NAFTA would lift that miserable performance statistic.<ref>Luz Mar\u00eda de la Mora, \"North American Free Trade Agreement\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1026.</ref>\n\nIn the run-up to implementation of NAFTA, Salinas had privatized hundreds of companies. During the Zedillo administration, he privatized [[Rail transport in Mexico#Privatization|the state railway company]], [[:es:Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M\u00e9xico|Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M\u00e9xico]]. This led to the suspension of passenger service in 1997.\n\n===Electoral reform===\n{{see|1997 Mexican legislative election}}\nZedillo saw electoral reform as a key issue for his administration.<ref>Zedillo, Ernesto. \u201cThe Right Track: Political and Economic Reform in Mexico.\u201d Harvard International Review, vol. 19, no. 1, 1996, pp. 38\u201367.

In July 1996, those talks resulted in the agreement of Mexico's four major parties on a reform package, which was ratified unanimously in legislature.  It created autonomous organizations to oversee elections, made the post of [[List of heads of government of Mexico City|Head of Government of Mexico City]], previously an appointed position, into an elective one, as of July 1997, and created closer oversight of campaign spending. \"Perhaps most crucially, it represents a first step toward consensus among the parties on a set of mutually accepted democratic rules of the game.\"<ref>Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1641-42.</ref> The reforms lowered the influence of the PRI and opened opportunities for other parties.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"The resurrection of the Mexican left in the 1997 elections: implications for the party system.\" Toward Mexico\u2019s Democratizations: Parties, Campaigns, Elections, and Public Opinion, New York, Routledge (1999).</ref> In the 1997 elections, for the first time the PRI did not win the majority in Congress.

The PRI presidential candidate, [[Francisco Labastida]] was not designated by the sitting president (as all former Presidential nominees from the PRI had been until that point), but by an open internal primary of the party.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"The making of the Mexican president, 2000: parties, candidates, and campaign strategy.\" Jorge Dom\u00ednguez and Lawson (2004): 123-56.</ref> Changes in the electoral rules meant that the government did not control voting as it had previously in the Ministry of the Interior.

Also important were some 10,000 Mexican poll watchers and over 850 foreign observers, including ex-president of the U.S., [[Jimmy Carter]]. [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] leader [[Subcomandante Marcos]] declared that the election was a \"dignified and respectable battleground.\"<ref>Fr\u00f6hling, Oliver, Carolyn Gallaher, and John Paul Jones, III. \"Imagining the Mexican election.\" Antipode 33.1 (2001): 2</ref> The results of the election were even more historic.

In Fox's autobiography he writes, \"There are still those old-guard ''priistas'' who consider Ernesto Zedillo a traitor to his class for his actions on the night of July 2, 2000, as the party boss who betrayed the machine.  But in that moment President Zedillo became a true democrat ... In minutes he preempted any possibility of violent resistance from hard-line ''priistas''. It was an act of electoral integrity that will forever mark the mild-mannered economist as a historic figure of Mexico's peaceful transition to democracy.\"<ref>Vicente Fox and Rob Allyn, ''Revolution of Hope: The Life, Faith, and Dreams of a Mexican President''.

In 1969 he entered the [[Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional|National Polytechnic Institute]], financing his studies by working in the National Army and Navy Bank (later known as ''Banj\u00e9rcito''). He graduated as an economist in 1972 and began lecturing.

His doctoral thesis was titled ''Mexico's Public External Debt: Recent History and Future Growth Related to Oil''.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Political career===\nZedillo began working in the [[Bank of Mexico]] (Mexico's central bank) as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, where he supported the adoption of macroeconomic policies for the country's improvement.\nBy 1987, he was named deputy-secretary of Planning and Budget Control in the Secretariat of Budget and Planning. In 1988, at the age of 36, he headed that secretariat. During his term as Secretary, Zedillo launched a Science and Technology reform.\n\nIn 1992, he was appointed [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretary of Education]] by president [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Carlos Salinas]].  During his tenure in this post, he was in charge of the revision the Mexican public school textbooks.  The changes, which took a softer line on foreign investment and the Porfiriato, among other topics, were highly controversial and the textbooks were withdrawn.<ref>Gilbert, Dennis. \u201cRewriting History: Salinas, Zedillo and the 1992 Textbook Controversy.\u201d Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos, vol. 13, no. 2, 1997, pp. 271\u2013297.

Although the PRI's presidential candidates were always chosen by the current president, and thus [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]] had originally been [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Salinas]]' candidate, their political relationship had been affected by a famous speech during the campaign in which Colosio said that [[Mexico]] had many problems. It is also notable that the assassination took place after Colosio visited the members of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista movement]] in Chiapas and promised to open dialogue, something the PRI opposed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nAfter Colosio's murder, this speech was seen as the main cause of his break with the president.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The choice of Zedillo was interpreted as Salinas' way of bypassing the strong Mexican political tradition of non-reelection and retaining real power, since Zedillo was not really a politician, but an economist (like Salinas), who clearly lacked the president's political talent and influence. It is unclear if Salinas had attempted to control Colosio, who was generally considered at that time to be a far better candidate.\n\nZedillo ran against [[Diego Fern\u00e1ndez de Cevallos]] of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] and second-timer [[Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas]] of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]]. He won with 48.69% of popular vote, and became the last president to distinguish the 70-year PRI dynasty in M\u00e9xico during the 20th century.\n\n==Presidency (1994\u20132000)==\n[[File:Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2009.jpg|right|thumb|230px| Zedillo at the World Economic Forum 2009]]\n[[File:Edmund S Phelps Ernesto Zedillo.jpg|right|thumb|230 px|Ernesto Zedillo with [[Edmund Phelps]], winner of the 2006 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], at the [[World Economic Forum]]'s Summit on the Global Agenda 2008]]\nAt age 43, Zedillo assumed the presidency on 1 December 1994 at the [[Legislative Palace of San L\u00e1zaro]], taking oath before the [[Congress of the Union]] presided by the [[President of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|deputy president]] Carlota Vargas Garza. Zedillo's electoral victory was perceived as clean, but he came to office as an accidental candidate with no political base of his own and no experience. During the first part of his presidency, he took inconsistent, zigzagging policy positions and there were rumors that he would resign or that there would be a coup d'\u00e9tat against him, which caused turmoil in financial markets.<ref name=\"Thomas Legler 1997\">Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p.1641</ref>\n\n===Cabinet===\nZedillo's [[Cabinet of Ernesto Zedillo|cabinet]] needed to have members who could deal with crises. Over the course of his presidency, he had four as [[Minister of the Interior]], [[Esteban Moctezuma]], who dealt with the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]]; [[Emilio Chuayffet]], who resigned following the [[Acteal massacre]]; [[Francisco Labastida]], who won the primary to determine the 2000 PRI presidential candidate; and [[Di\u00f3doro Carrasco Altamirano]], who dealt with the strike at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].\n\n===Financial Crisis of December 1994===\n{{Main|Mexican peso crisis}}\nA few days after taking office, one of the biggest economic crisis in Mexican history hit the country. Although it was outgoing President Salinas who was mainly blamed for the crisis, Salinas claimed that President Zedillo made a mistake by changing the economic policies held by his administration. Zedillo devalued the peso by 15%, which prompted the near-collapse of the financial system.<ref>Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\", p. 1641.</ref> [[Mexican peso crisis|The crisis]] ended after a series of reforms and actions led by Zedillo. US president [[Bill Clinton]] granted a US$20&nbsp;billion loan to Mexico, which helped in one of Zedillo's initiatives to rescue the banking system.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-authorizes-loan-to-mexico | title = Clinton authorizes loan to Mexico | publisher = [[History (U.S. TV channel)]] | date = 31 January 1995 | accessdate = 27 January 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180324010125/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-authorizes-loan-to-mexico | archive-date = 24 March 2018 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n===Break with Salinas===\nZedillo had been an accidental presidential candidate who was vaulted to prominence with the assassination of Colosio. The conflict between Zedillo and Salinas marked the early part of Zedillo's presidency.<ref>Fuentes, Carlos. \u201cCoalticue's Skirt: Hidden Aspects of Mexico's Political Rivalry in 1995.\u201d The Brown Journal of World Affairs, vol. 2, no. 2, 1995, pp. 175\u2013180. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/24590093 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> As with De la Madrid and Salinas, Zedillo had never been elected to office and had no experience in politics. His performance as a candidate was lackluster, but the outbreak of violence in Chiapas and the shock of the Colosio assassination swayed voters to support the PRI candidate in the 1994 election. In office, Zedillo was perceived as a puppet-president with Salinas following the model of [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] in the wake of the 1928 assassination of president-elect [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]]. In order to consolidate his own power in the presidency, Zedillo had to assert his independence from Salinas. On 28 February 1995 Zedillo ordered the arrest of the ex-president's older brother [[Ra\u00fal Salinas]] for the September 1994 murder of PRI General Secretary [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu]]  marked a decisive break between Zedillo and Salinas.<ref name=\"Thomas Legler 1997\"/>\n\n===Zapatista Crisis===\n{{Main|1995 Zapatista Crisis}}\nMexico had been in turmoil since January 1994, with the initial Zapatista rebellion and two political assassinations. The presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]] of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] was assassinated in March 1994, and his campaign manager Ernesto Zedillo replaced him candidate a few days later. The other high-profile assassination, that of PRI Secretary General [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu]], brother-in-law of President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] in September 1994, laid bare political rivalries within the PRI. In order to give credibility to the investigations of those political crimes and grant \"a healthy distance\", president Zedillo appointed Antonio Lozano Gracia a member of the opposition Political Party [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] as [[Attorney General of Mexico]].  Zedillo inherited the rebellion in Chiapas, but it was up to his administration to handle it.\n\nOn 5 January 1995, the Secretary of Interior [[Esteban Moctezuma]] started a secret meeting process with [[Subcomandante Marcos|Marcos]] called \"Steps Toward Peace\" [[Chiapas]]. Talks seemed promising for an agreement, but Zedillo backed away, apparently because the military was not in accord with the government's apparent \"acceptance of the Zapatistas' control over much of Chiapas territory.\"<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', p. 242.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=330331|title=Zedillo rompi\u00f3 acuerdo de paz con el EZLN: Esteban Moctezuma - Proceso|date=11 January 2013|website=Proceso.com.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2013/01/62462.php|title=El Universal - Opinion - Renuncia en Gobernaci\u00f3n|website=Eluniversalmas.com.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802123734/http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2013/01/62462.php|archive-date=2 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In February 1995, the Mexican government identified the masked Subcomandante Marcos as Rafael Sebasti\u00e1n Guill\u00e9n, a former professor at the [[Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana]] in Mexico City.

The Mexican economy suffered following the December 1994 peso crisis, when currency was devalued by 15% and the U.S. intervened to prop up the economy with a multi-billion dollar loan, so that NAFTA under the Zedillo administration got off to a rocky start.  The Mexican GDP was -7% and there were hopes that NAFTA would lift that miserable performance statistic.<ref>Luz Mar\u00eda de la Mora, \"North American Free Trade Agreement\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1026.</ref>\n\nIn the run-up to implementation of NAFTA, Salinas had privatized hundreds of companies. During the Zedillo administration, he privatized [[Rail transport in Mexico#Privatization|the state railway company]], [[:es:Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M\u00e9xico|Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M\u00e9xico]].

It created autonomous organizations to oversee elections, made the post of [[List of heads of government of Mexico City|Head of Government of Mexico City]], previously an appointed position, into an elective one, as of July 1997, and created closer oversight of campaign spending. \"Perhaps most crucially, it represents a first step toward consensus among the parties on a set of mutually accepted democratic rules of the game.\"<ref>Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1641-42.</ref> The reforms lowered the influence of the PRI and opened opportunities for other parties.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"The resurrection of the Mexican left in the 1997 elections: implications for the party system.\" Toward Mexico\u2019s Democratizations: Parties, Campaigns, Elections, and Public Opinion, New York, Routledge (1999).</ref> In the 1997 elections, for the first time the PRI did not win the majority in Congress.

The PRI presidential candidate, [[Francisco Labastida]] was not designated by the sitting president (as all former Presidential nominees from the PRI had been until that point), but by an open internal primary of the party.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"The making of the Mexican president, 2000: parties, candidates, and campaign strategy.\" Jorge Dom\u00ednguez and Lawson (2004): 123-56.</ref> Changes in the electoral rules meant that the government did not control voting as it had previously in the Ministry of the Interior. Elections were now  the jurisdiction of the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), with Mexicans having faith that elections would be free and fair.<ref>Wallis, Darren. \"The Mexican Presidential and Congressional Elections of 2000 and Democratic Transition.\" Bulletin of Latin American Research 20.3 (2001): 304-323.</ref> IFE implemented new  procedures regarding campaigns and balloting, with rules for finance, guarantee of the secret ballot, and unbiased counting of votes. Also important were some 10,000 Mexican poll watchers and over 850 foreign observers, including ex-president of the U.S., [[Jimmy Carter]]. [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] leader [[Subcomandante Marcos]] declared that the election was a \"dignified and respectable battleground.\"<ref>Fr\u00f6hling, Oliver, Carolyn Gallaher, and John Paul Jones, III. \"Imagining the Mexican election.\" Antipode 33.1 (2001): 2</ref> The results of the election were even more historic. For the first time since the founding of Zedillo's party in 1929, an opposition candidate won, a peaceful change from an authoritarian government.<ref>Klesner, Joseph L. \"The end of Mexico's one-party regime.\" PS: Political Science & Politics 34.1 (2001): 107-114.</ref> Zedillo went on national television when the polls closed, declaring that [[Vicente Fox]] had won. In Fox's autobiography he writes, \"There are still those old-guard ''priistas'' who consider Ernesto Zedillo a traitor to his class for his actions on the night of July 2, 2000, as the party boss who betrayed the machine.  But in that moment President Zedillo became a true democrat ... In minutes he preempted any possibility of violent resistance from hard-line ''priistas''. It was an act of electoral integrity that will forever mark the mild-mannered economist as a historic figure of Mexico's peaceful transition to democracy.\"<ref>Vicente Fox and Rob Allyn, ''Revolution of Hope: The Life, Faith, and Dreams of a Mexican President''.

This has led commentators to allege the trial to be politically motivated, perhaps by a member of his own political party, the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], angry about Zedillo's reforms that led to the party losing power in the [[2000 Mexican presidential election]], after 71 years of continuous political rule.<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://www.economist.com/node/21561904 |title=Mexico and Justice: The trials of Ernesto Zedillo |publisher=[[The Economist]] |date = 1 September 2012|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Department of State]] recommended that President Zedillo be granted [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity from prosecution]] due to the actions occurring as part of his official capacity as head of state.
