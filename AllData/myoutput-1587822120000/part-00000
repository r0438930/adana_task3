Fundamental conservative ideas are grounded in [[Confucianism|Confucian values]] and  strands of Chinese philosophy associated with [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s teachings, a large centralized government which intervenes closely in the lives of individuals on both social and economic levels, and the construction of unified [[Sinocentrism|Sinocentric national identity]]. Conservative ideology in Taiwan constitutes the character and policies of the [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang (KMT)]] party and that of the [[Pan-Blue Coalition|pan-blue camp]].\n\n__TOC__\n\n== Overview: Three spheres of Conservative Policy ==\n\n=== Cross-Strait Policy ===\nThe relationship between the Republic of China (ROC) and the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] is Taiwan's main concern in foreign affairs. In a broad sense, the conservative Cross-Strait stance adheres to the notion of One-China, represented by the Kuomintang (KMT). However, the integration of this [[One-China|One-China philosophy]] into the party line has changed considerably. By the end of [[Chiang Kai-shek|Chiang Kai-shek\u2019]]<nowiki/>s presidency, the agenda of radical pro-unification via military force has slowly devolved into the desire for peaceful and strategic, albeit competitive coexistence rather than outright contention. Over time, the latter strategy has consolidated into the [[One China principle|One-China principle]] as a result of the [[1992 Consensus]], which proposed a unified entity comprising both Taiwan and the Mainland, while leaving the issue of representation open to interpretation. From a comparative standpoint, conservatives derive economic and security benefits from communication with the PRC, while warning against Taiwan's isolation and insecurity implied under [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwanese sovereignty.]] For Taiwan's political conservatives, the status quo is less than optimal, but at least better than independence from the PROC.\n\n=== Domestic Policy ===\nConservative domestic policy in Taiwan reflects a strong government at the center of policy and decision-making, in which the state takes initiative for individuals and closely intervenes in their daily lives. This runs counter to [[Western conservatism|Western political conservatism]], which supports a [[small government]] that operates on the perimeter of social life in order to respect the liberty of citizens. As such, conservative KMT policies may also be characterized by a focus on maintaining the traditions and doctrine of Confucian thought, namely reinforcing the morals of paternalism and patriarchy in Taiwan's society. Moreover, conservatism focuses on preserving the safety of the status quo under the [[One China principle|One-China principle]], which embodies the traditional political thought of the KMT party, as opposed to the uncertainty of change under the opposition parties' associated pro-independence movement. On a broader level, political conservatism within Taiwan revolves around building and later, preserving a unified Chinese national identity based on [[Sinocentrism]]. Similar to the threat of multiculturalism which governs one primary concern for western conservatives  i.e. United States,  KMT policies are against the integration of [[Taiwanese aborigines|Aboriginal culture]] into the mainstream Chinese identity.\n\n=== Economic Policy ===\nIn terms of [[Economic policy|economic policies]], [[conservatism]] in [[Taiwan]] can be described as highly interventionist. The national economy is centrally planned for the purpose of development and little separation between state and society exists. That opposes the general notion of economic conservatism, where little to no [[Economic interventionism|government intervention]] in the economic affairs is desired. This ideological difference stems from the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] roots of Taiwanese conservatism. Following the notion of Confucian [[Paternalistic conservatism|paternalism]], where the father is the head of the family, conservatives see the state as the head of society. As such, the state has to ensure the well-being of the population by promoting development and interfering in the economic affairs. Examples of conservative policies include the 1949-1953 Land Reforms, the 1950-1968 Economic Reforms aimed at encouraging production for export, the [[Ten Major Construction Projects]] and the establishment of the [[Three Links|Three Direct Links]] with [[China]].\n\n== Origins and Philosophy  ==\n\n=== Socioreligious tradition of Confucianism ===\nThere are four basic elements of [[Confucianism]] which apply to conservatist governance. The [[Paternalism|Paternalistic State]] entails top-down decision making under the notion that the \u201cFather is the head of the house, and likewise, the state the head of society.\u201d Leaders possess, ''[[Jen (Confucianism)|jen]]'', a supreme virtue representing human qualities at their best which determines their right to rule. The idea of s''ocial order and harmony'' translates into the assumption of the benevolent state - ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|ren/humaneness]],'' with which civil society works together - ''shu/reciprocity,'' rather than oppose, monitor, and scrutinize.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Chun-chieh|last2=Wu|first2=Kung-ming|date=|title=Taiwan and the Confucius Aspiration: Towards the Twenty-first Century|url=http://huang.cc.ntu.edu.tw/pdf/CCB1306.pdf|journal=NTU Databases|volume=3|pages=72\u201386|via=ntu.edu.tw}}</ref> The [[Patriarchy|Notion of Patriarchy]] positions men as leaders, and women as passive. Confucius and [[Mencius]], in the [[Three Obediences and Four Virtues|''three obediences'']] depict obedience to the father and elder brothers when young, to the husband when married, and to the sons when widowed. Finally, c''ollectivity'' captures the absence of the tradition of celebrating the individual in contrast to the United States. Instead, hierarchy is respected because it reflects naturally ordained positions in society. Moreover, the fulfilment of individual duties in a given position is necessary for the function of society.\n\n=== Sun Yat-sen's Political Perspectives ===\nMany of the Kuomintang's policies were inspired by its founder [[Sun Yat-sen]]\u2019s vision, and his ''[[Three Principles of the People]]'': nationalism (\u6c11\u65cf\u4e3b\u7fa9), democracy (\u6c11\u6b0a\u4e3b\u7fa9) and people\u2019s livelihood (\u6c11\u751f\u4e3b\u7fa9). These [[Three Principles of the People|three principles]] combine to make Taiwan a free, powerful, and prosperous nation, although they are selectively interpreted in a specific context which deviates from Sun Yat-sen's original intent. For example, during Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s rule and much of [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]\u2019s, the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian state]] overshadowed democracy by censoring the people\u2019s voice. However, most of his political ideas which were later adapted by his successors in governing Taiwan included equalization of land ownership, learning Chinese traditional morality through Confucian values, and the regulation of state capital by national corporations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&post=6996|title=Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Political Philosophy - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=1965-04-01|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==  Chronology of Kuomintang governments   ==\n\n=== Chiang Kai-shek (1945\u20131975) ===\n{{Main|Chiang Kai-shek}}\n[[File:\u8523\u4e2d\u6b63\u8096\u50cf(\u4e0a\u8272).jpg|thumb|President Chiang Kai-shek]]\n\n==== Cross-Strait Policy ====\nChiang Kai-shek`s retreat to Taiwan following the [[Chinese Civil War]], and the subsequent establishment of the ROC in December 1949, marked the beginning of the One-China party line.  In Taiwan, the KMT immediately insisted on its right to maintain the position of the legal representative of all of China. The \u201cgovernment in exile\u201d, a term the ROC under Chiang Kai-shek elected to call itself, remained a status recognized by the international community until October 1971, when Taiwan's seat in the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] was replaced by that of the PRC, and February 1972, which marked [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China|Nixon's historical visit to Peking]] which ended in the shocking [[Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9|Shanghai Communique.]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Republic of China under Chiang Kai-Shek: Taiwan Today .|last=Lumley|first=F.A.|publisher=|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the KMT sought to bide time and strength under US assistance and protection in order to retake the mainland. The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] prompted [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] to order the Seventh Fleet to defend Taiwan against the possibility of invasion on June 27, 1950.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Taiwan under Chiang Kai Shek's Era: 1945-1976|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/Sinologie/repository/uePRDemokrUIdentTaiwanSeit1980/Cheng_TaiwanUnderChiangKai-shek_sEra1945-1976.pdf|journal=Asian Profile|volume= 16| issue =  4|pages=299\u2013315|via=}}</ref> Although the US overall goal was not to aid Chiang's return to the mainland, but to build Taiwan into a fortress against communism, it allowed Chiang to pursue his military vision of reunification.\n\nAs a staunch [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], Chiang pushed his doctrine of pro-reunification under the ideology of liberating the mainland from the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] using force. Hence, the army of civilians, legal specialists, troops, and other skilled workers that came with him viewed Taiwan as a temporary base for building industrial and military strength towards the level necessary to retake the mainland. In August 1955, and later in 1958, Chiang demonstrated his commitment for settling KMT-[[Communist Party of China|Communist Party of China (CCP)]] representative rivalry with military force by instigating conflict along the Tachen, Kinmen and Matsu islands in the [[First Taiwan Strait Crisis]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Jinghua|date=November 2011|title=Taiwan's Role in the Breakout of the Taiwan Strait Crises: A Historical Perspective|url=http://isdp.eu/content/uploads/publications/2011_lu_taiwans-role-in-the-breakout.pdf|journal=Institute for Security and Development Policy|volume=|pages=6\u201315|via=}}</ref> The PROC began shelling the islands in response to Chiang's deployment of approximately 60,000 armed troops into the area, which prompted the [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]]. In the 1960s smaller skirmishes were accompanied by unconventional strategies aimed at the liberation of China. Chiang Kai-shek deployed planes which dropped leaflets and sent the air force on reconnaissance and espionage missions i.e. blowing up bridges and infrastructure in the mainland. Nevertheless, the 1970s was marked by [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]], signaling Taiwan's decline in the international community, and with it, the desire to recapture the mainland was replaced by the necessity to survive under the new unstable status quo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idsa.in/idsastrategiccomments/TaiwansFailureattheUN_JPPanda_240908|title=Taiwan's Failure at the UN {{!}} Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|website=idsa.in|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==== Domestic Policy ====\nThe KMT's [[One-China policy]] also influenced its governing policy in Taiwan. Dealing with the island's weakening economy after a long period of prosperity under the Japanese, as well as the residents\u2019 dissatisfaction of KMT's administration, Chiang Kai-shek decided on consolidating his dominance through an authoritarian political system to stabilize Taiwan's internal affairs, opening path for reunification with Mainland.\n\nStructure-wise, the government of Chiang imposed on Taiwan was of little difference than the [[Government of the Republic of China|previous form used to administer Mainland China]]. Almost all of the governmental positions, with the addition of the highest military positions, police, and the educational system, were occupied by [[Mainland Chinese|Mainlanders]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Taiwan/Government-and-society|title=Taiwan {{!}} History, Facts, & People - Government and society|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=2018-01-13|language=en}}</ref> Ethnic division in the establishment of the administration system was visible: [[Hoklo people|Hokkien people]], the major ethnicity in Taiwan, took control over local governments. Meanwhile, the minority [[Hakka people|Hakka]] occupied top positions in bodies such as police and railroads, due to their favorability towards Mainlanders.<ref name=\":4\" /> The KMT created a separate government for Taiwan, consisting of five municipalities and sixteen counties, where local residents could exercise voting rights.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Taiwan: A New History|last=Wang|first=Peter Chen-main|publisher=M.E.

Their goal was to change the Japanese colonial laid rental system which promoted unfair distribution of land and contributed to the gap between rich and poor. The reforms aimed at making all farmers the owners of their own fields.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=10,23,45,10&post=15716|title=Land-to-the-tiller program transformed Taiwan - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=2009-08-28|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> The reforms consisted of three stages. First, compulsory reduction of land rent, which limited farm rents to a maximum of 37,5 percent of the annual yield of the main crops. The second stage - sale of public land, that was previously owned and confiscated from Japanese colonists, to actual tenants at a price significantly below market value. The final third stage - the \u201cLand-to-the-Tiller Act\u201d, under which land owned by landlords in excess of 2,9 hectares was compulsorily sold to the government, which in turn resold it to tenants.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Samuel P.S.|date=1987|title=Economics, Economic Bureaucracy, and Taiwan's Economic Development|jstor=2758133|journal=Pacific Affairs|volume=60|issue=2|pages=226\u2013247|doi=10.2307/2758133}}</ref> These reforms touched a vast majority of the Taiwanese agricultural population, with 70% of tenant households having their rents reduced in the first stage. The second and third stages also contributed to reducing the land farmed by tenants from 44% in 1949 to 17% in 1953.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/1582258/land-reform-in-taiwan|title=Land Reform in Taiwan by Chen Cheng, 1961 {{!}} Online Research Library: Questia|website=www.questia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>\n\nEconomically, the reforms were important as with the change of ownership, the incentive framework of the cultivator was transformed - promoting an increase of work efforts, production, investment and adoption of new technologies. This rising productivity was necessary for the subsequent transfer of resources - labor and capital, to other sectors of the economy.<ref name=\":0\" /> The reforms also brought an impact to the income distribution, improving the incomes of tenants and new owners. It is argued that such policy of distribution first, and growth later also contributed to the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] growth pattern of the country.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Chiang Ching-kuo (1975\u20131988) ===\n{{Main|Chiang Ching-kuo}}\n[[File:ChiangChingkuo photo.jpg|thumb|255x255px|President Chiang Ching-kuo]]\n\n==== Cross-Strait Policy ====\nTaiwan under KMT president Chiang Ching-kuo embodied a move towards more flexible Cross-Strait relationship in an era of official diplomatic isolation, launched by the [[Dates of establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China|US recognition of the PRC]] on January 1, 1979.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/united-states-announces-that-it-will-recognize-communist-china|title=United States announces that it will recognize communist China - Dec 15, 1978 - HISTORY.com|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>  While Chiang Kai-shek's original One-China philosophy maintained Taiwan as its sole legitimate representative, a stance at the time recognized by the international community, his son, confronted by Taiwan's declining international status and the rise of China's power and relevance, could no longer maintain the same hard stance and openly hostile policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=10,23,45,10&post=14527|title=Book explores Taiwan's 'pragmatic' approach to foreign policy-making - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=2007-07-06|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> Thus, the KMT under Kuo shifted its interpretation of One-China  to the notion of representative rivalry within its current [[Cross-Strait relations]], which expresses Taiwan's necessity to negotiate for its relevance and its concessions made in other foreign arenas in light of the CPP's competing claim of representation.\n\nUnder the One-China line, Chiang Ching-kuo negotiated for its own security in order to compete with the PRC's growing power. As such, he filled the void of formal diplomatic ties to other countries with unofficial ties, sharing the modern paradigm of [[Foreign relations of Taiwan|Taiwan's foreign relations.]] Chiang Ching-kuo's responded bitterly to the severing of official relations in 1979 and the termination of the [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty|Mutual Defense Treaty]], causing him to reiterate his five principles with regard to ROC-US relations under the banner of \u201creality, continuity, security, legality, and governmentality.\" As a result, the United States Congress pushed the [[Taiwan Relations Act]] on Oct. 10 the same year. The act was an unofficial brokerage which allowed the US to deal with external threats to Taiwan and to sell arms for the purpose of defense building.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yeh|first=Chung-lu|date=April 2014|title=Policy Brief III: Taiwan Relations Act: Time For A Change?|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/TRAPolicyBrief.Lu__0.pdf|journal=Policy Brief Series: Wilson Center|volume=Three|pages=2\u20138|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the \u201c[[Three Noes]]\u201d: no contact, no compromise, no negotiation, with the PROC was adopted in response to the ROC's \u201cThree Links\u201d and maintained by president Kuo. However, the [[China Airlines Flight 334|hijacking of a Chinese Airline Cargo Plane]] on May 3, 1986, combined with domestic pressure by citizens demanding to reach the mainland, undid the policy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Language Politics and identity in Taiwan: Naming China|last=Hui|first=Ching-Chang|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-0415836012|location=|pages=}}</ref> In 1987, an Open Door policy allowed the ROC Red Cross to issue permits for people from Taiwan to travel to their relatives in the mainland, prompting the start of ongoing civilian exchanges between the ROC and the PRC.\n\nThe compromise of \u201c[[Chinese Taipei]]\u201d at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] is a significant example of concessions made during Chiang Ching-kuo's administration. Due to China's complaints regarding the term Chinese Taiwan, and the registering of athletes as Chinese athletes, Taiwan adopted \"Chinese Taipei\"  - a term that silently endorsed the One-China principle, and resembled a compromise of representation to which both parties were satisfied.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/the-curious-case-of-taiwan-and-chinese-taipei/1128282|title=The curious case of Taiwan and Chinese Taipei|work=outlookindia.com/|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> This was a pragmatic move toward regaining international space for the ROC, one which embodied a move toward reunification.\n\n==== Domestic Policy ====\nIn light of growing domestic pro-democracy sentiment, abandonment by the international community - starting from the United States\u2019 decision to not recognize the ROC diplomatically, and China's rising power and international status, Chiang Ching-kuo initiated various strategic, limited democratic concessions in order to consolidate KMT authority against internal and external pressures. Doing so would allow the KMT to strategically continue as a strong state under the semblance of democracy, while also enabling the ROC securely allocate attention abroad in negotiating its One-China policy. Ultimately, human rights issues still remained a major controversy in this era, given that Chiang Ching-kuo kept the main policies of his father's reign alive. However, the [[Martial law in Taiwan|Martial Law]], the product of his father's security concerns of a communist rebellion was eventually lifted in 1987.\n\nChiang Ching-kuo's gradual switch from ethnic Chinese conservatism to Taiwanese conservatism began with reshuffling the cabinet to include more ethnically Taiwanese members, albeit on a small scale.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Taiwan: A New History|last=Rubinstein|first=Murray A.|publisher=M.E.

While Chiang Ching-kuo began slowly relaxing restraints on political opposition, \u201cTang-wai\u201d was already earning large support from local elections in the end of the 1970s; much to the extent that after [[Kaohsiung Incident]] in 1979, the KMT initiated stricter surveillance, and capture, of opposition members.<ref name=\":6\" /> As political activism in the 1980s attracted more and more Taiwanese, the KMT government started carrying out open policies to encourage participation of the remaining population, such as including new  talents and religious people.<ref name=\":6\" /> A prominent example would be Chiang's decision to pick [[Lee Teng-hui]], an original Taiwanese, to be the country's vice-president in 1982.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite thesis |last=Hansson |first=Ulf |date=2007 |title=Chiang Ching-Kuo A Motive Analysis |type=Bachelor |publisher=Lund University |url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/1319621}}</ref> In, 1986, Chiang Ching-kuo did the unthinkable: he flouted the KMT by allowing the illegal formation of the [[Democratic Progressive Party|Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)]]. These policies demonstrate that Chiang Ching-kuo sought to gain international support in order to strengthen his regime, by taking the moral high ground of democratic legitimacy against the rising threat of China. In doing so, he also sought to appease the United States for finance and security reasons.\n\nAnother element of Chiang Ching-kuo's era represented the continued exclusion of [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal people of Taiwan]] for fear of polluting Sinocentric national identity. Although the DPP was formed, it was never based on the intention of restoring rights of Aboriginals, but rather as a front to dissipate anger and satisfaction. Furthermore, there were no policies set in motion to return land stolen under Chiang Kai-shek, lift the ban addressing Aboriginal languages, or provide education in schools to continue Aboriginal culture. Only after democratic consolidation occurred after Chiang Ching-kuo, were aboriginal rights restored. In tandem with maintaining a strict Sino-centric identity, as Chiang Ching-kuo and his men were attempting to introduce a new brand of conservatism to the party structure, on the nationwide scale the government was still labeled authoritarian conservative.\n\n==== Economic Policy ====\nThe 1970s was period of rapid economic development for the Taiwanese economy. The government realized that the existing infrastructure was reaching its maximum capacity and was no longer able to accommodate the economy's needs. Chiang Ching-kuo became the driving force behind the proposal of the first post war large-scale infrastructure construction, namely the [[Ten Major Construction Projects]]. They included six projects covering highway, rail, sea and air transportation infrastructure, and others - shipbuilding, oil refining, steel manufacturing and nuclear power generation. The work on the projects started in the early 1970s while Chiang was still a Premier and most of the projects were completed by the end of the decade.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=8,8,29,32,32,45&post=13964|title=Building the Economy of the Future - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=2011-06-01|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> The construction significantly contributed to mitigating the effects of the 1973 oil crisis, such as spiking unemployment resulting from factory closures.

Thus, his contributions to Conservatism must be carefully limited to the economy sphere. Indeed, throughout his presidency, Lee rejected the \u201c1992\u201d Consensus\" under the claim that China's characterization of Taiwan as a \"renegade province\u201d embodied a straw man argument. Instead, he considered Taiwan as having always remained historically independent, under the observation of the [[Treaty of San Francisco|San-Francisco Treaty.]] Such a radical stance worried China to the extent in which military sanctions were used, prompting the outbreak of the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis]].\n\n==== Domestic Policy ====\nDue to being regarded as the pioneer of the liberalization ofTaiwanese politics, many internal policies under Lee's presidency did not follow the conservative political line traditional to KMT. During his rule, he actively promoted democracy by removing permanent members of the Legislative Yuan - namely the Mainlanders in power since 1949, as well as holding free elections afterwards to include more Taiwanese members. He emphasized his ethnically Taiwanese identity in his rule, crafting a stronger sense of [[Taiwanization|Taiwanese nationalism]] following his predecessor Chiang Ching-kuo's steps.\n\n==== Economic Policy ====\nDuring the 1990s the Taiwanese government actively pursued monitoring and control over the cross-strait investments. Various regulations were implemented, such as requiring all firms that were investing in the mainland to report the amount and the nature of their investments. If they failed to do so, variety of punishments were awaiting - including denying permissions to travel, cutting off credits and exchange operations, denying future investment applications.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|jstor=10.7249/mg507osd.11|title=Chinese Economic Coercion Against Taiwan|journal=Chinese Economic Coercion Against Taiwan|date=2007|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=9780833039699|editor-last=Tanner|editor-first=Murray Scot|edition=1|series=A Tricky Weapon to Use|pages=33\u201372|last1=Tanner|first1=Murray Scot}}</ref> Regulations also prescribed that new investments over US$1 million would require advance approval, further strengthening the government's ability to oversee the mainland related economic activities.\n\nThis period was also marked by a major shift in the Taiwanese investments - from-small scale manufacturing and mostly labor-intensive industries, such as apparel, footwear, food processing, to higher technology production and infrastructure projects. As a result, the value of investments increased greatly, bringing up the government's fears of Taiwan's growing reliance on the mainland. In response, President [[Lee Teng-hui]] asserted that the country's excessive dependence upon overseas investment, particularly in the PRC, was diverting capital and attention from revitalizing the domestic economy, and the government might have to put a lid on it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fletcher Matthew|first=Eyton Laurence|date=August 1996|title=A Sharp Change of Course: President Lee and Big Business Spar Over China|url=|journal=Time Magazine|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> One of the new strategies to diversify Taiwanese investments in other less hostile markets, was the \u201cGo South\u201d policy that encouraged outsourcing production in [[Southeast Asia]]. This policy however didn't produce the needed results and reduce the investments to the mainland.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSeeing the weaknesses of the \u201cGo South\u201d strategy, the government took another approach introducing the \u201cNo Haste, Be Patient\u201d policy. It required case-by-case approvals of Taiwanese investments in high-technology and infrastructure in the mainland. Also, it imposed limits on investments in the [[China|PRC]] - with a maximum investment level of 20 to 40 percent of a firm's total net worth and a ceiling of US$50 million on individual investments.<ref name=\":2\" /> A following regulation also banned Taiwanese investment in most large-scale infrastructure and energy projects. It was argued that the policy's objective was not to stop entirely the movement towards the mainland, but to slow and manage the outflow of high-tech firms and give them the opportunity to develop at home. Lee also claimed that as long as Beijing was being hostile towards Taiwan, such unrestrained investments and excessive reliance on the mainland would undermine the national security.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nLee's policies were met with strong opposition - both from the business levels and the general electorate, which supported closer economic ties with the mainland, in spite of concerns over security threats and pressure from Beijing.\n\n=== Ma Ying-jeou (2008-2016) ===\n{{Main|Ma Ying-jeou}}\n[[File:Ma Ying-jeou official cropped.jpg|thumb|287x287px|President Ma Ying-jeou]]\n\n==== Cross-Strait Policy ====\nUnder the presidency of [[Ma Ying-jeou]], the 1992 consensus carried on, allowing Taiwan to silently maintain its representation of One-China. In the context of this stalemate, Ma then turned towards bolstering Taiwan's security and international position by implementing flexible diplomacy. As such, Ma's main vision was to slowly restore the ''[[modus vivendi]]'' in regard to the growing power and influence of the ROC by scaling down the hostile relationship which had greatly escalated during Lee Teng-hui's and [[Chen Shui-bian]]\u2019s presidencies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/03/16/former-taiwan-president-ma-on-one-china-the-1992-consensus-and-taiwans-future/|title=Former Taiwan president Ma on One China, the 1992 consensus, and Taiwan's future|last=Whelan-Wuest|first=Maeve|date=2017-03-16|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-01-13|language=en-US}}</ref> According to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Taiwan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] during Ma\u2019s presidency, the consensus represented the ROC\u2019s principles of \u201cdignity, autonomy, pragmatism, and flexibility\u201d in foreign affairs.

Following the growing desires and the increasing pressure from the business community, a few weeks after Ma's inauguration he initiated talks between Taiwan and the mainland regarding the issue of the [[Three Links|Three Direct Links]]. These are the three main paths of communication between Taiwan and PRC - via mail, transportation and commerce, which were banned between the two sides for almost six decades. The absence of the three links has been a huge barrier for Taiwanese businesses, increasing shipment costs and obstructing access to a potentially large market, low labor costs and talent pool in the mainland. It also prevented investment and development of multinational companies back in Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eai.nus.edu.sg/publications/files/BB415.pdf|title=The Economics of Taiwan's Three Direct Links with Mainland China|last=Chen|first=Chien-Hsun|date=27 November 2008|website=National University of Singapore}}</ref>\n\nFinally, on November 4, 2008 the two sides signed series of agreements regarding each link and Three Direct Links were established.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rieti.go.jp/en/china/09063001.html|title=China in Transition\u300cImproved Cross-Straits Relations under the Ma Ying-jeou Administration - A path to peaceful reunification -\u300d|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en}}</ref> The successful talks mark a historic moment signifying that cross-Strait relations have moved past hostility towards negotiation and cooperation. The opposition has been sceptical, repeatedly claiming that while such move might be economically beneficial for Taiwan, it is compromising the national security with Taiwanese airports being open to PRC aircraft. In reality however, because of this development, cross-strait relations have increasingly become oriented towards rapprochement rather than confrontation.\n\nAnother economic policy of Ma's government is the [[Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement]]. Signed in 2010, the Agreement aims to reduce tariffs and commercial barriers between the two-sides, with the hope for much-needed boost to Taiwan's economy. Yet, it was not received well by the public, giving start of protests and a fierce public debate over the effects of the agreement. Opponents have expressed concerns for the future of  the local economy, as Taiwanese workers and small businesses would have to compete with  increasing imports of cheaper Chinese goods. At the heart of the protests however, has been the fear that the ECFA might be led to reunification with Beijing, which sees the island as a Chinese province.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/27/world/la-fg-taiwan-protests-20100627|title=Taiwan trade pact with China fires up protesters|last=Sui|first=Cindy|date=2010-06-27|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> The President has asserted that the deal is about economics, not politics, and has affirmed his confidence over Taiwanese democracy and its ability to fend off undue pressure from the PRC.\n\n== Conservatives in Taiwan ==\n\n=== Political Parties ===\n{{Main|Pan-Blue Coalition}}\nThe Conservative parties in Taiwan or the so-called \u201c[[Pan-Blue Coalition|pan-blue camp]]\u201d includes the Kuomintang (KMT), the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party (PFP)]] and the [[New Party (Taiwan)|New Party (NP)]].\n\nKuomintang is the main conservative party and currently it is the largest opposition party in the Legislative Yuan with 35 seats.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/01/17/2003637386|title=ELECTIONS: DPP secures absolute majority in Legislative Yuan - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>\n\nPeople's First Party is a liberal conservative party, founded by former KMT General Secretary and Taiwan Provincial Governor [[James Soong]] after the 2000 presidential elections. It is the main contender with the KMT for the conservative votes.

The NP has been a vanishing force in the political landscape, not having won any seats in the Legislative Yuan since the 2008 elections.\n\n=== Supporter Base ===\nInitially, the [[Pan-Blue Coalition|pan-blue camp]] and the [[Pan-Green Coalition|pan-green camp]] reflected the ideological differences within society over national identity. Those ideological differences were manifested through the different stances on cross-strait policy - with the blue-camp being pro-unification and the green-camp - pro-independence. Therefore, determining party affiliation was based on ethnicity and the attitude towards the relationship with the mainland.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jamestown.org/program/taiwans-election-results-reflect-shift-in-attitudes/|title=Taiwan's Election Results Reflect Shift in Attitudes - Jamestown|work=Jamestown|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}</ref> As a result, the pan-blue camp supporter base traditionally consisted of people mainly having Chinese identities and pro-unification attitudes.\n\nRecently however, it has been observed that the alignment with a party has grown beyond these traditional dichotomies. This has been influenced by the growth of a distinct Taiwanese identity, rooted not in ethno-cultural aspect, but in the historical, economic and political development of the island.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://esc.nccu.edu.tw/course/news.php?Sn=166#|title=\u516c\u544a\uff1a\u81fa\u7063\u6c11\u773e\u81fa\u7063\u4eba/\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba\u8a8d\u540c\u8da8\u52e2\u5206\u4f48(1992\u5e7406\u6708~2017\u5e7406\u6708\uff09 - \u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78 \u9078\u8209\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3|website=esc.nccu.edu.tw|language=zh-tw|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> The change has affected people's preferences, with a growing concern over each party's capability and will to maintain what is being considered Taiwanese identity. As a result of this tendency and in attempt to appeal to the growing group of people who identify as Taiwanese, the KMT has lost its idealistic pan-Chinese passion. To avoid marginalization, it has focused rather on practical steps of Sino-Taiwanese cooperation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Gunter|date=2004|title=Taiwan's Political Parties and National Identity: The Rise of an Overarching Consensus|jstor=10.1525/as.2004.44.4.534|journal=Asian Survey|volume=44|issue=4|pages=534\u2013554|doi=10.1525/as.2004.44.4.534}}</ref>\n\nAnother major concern for the citizens has become the parties capacity to retain the peace and stability across the Strait, with the majority of people preferring the status quo over unification or independence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://esc.nccu.edu.tw/course/news.php?Sn=167#|title=\u516c\u544a\uff1a\u81fa\u7063\u6c11\u773e\u7d71\u7368\u7acb\u5834\u8da8\u52e2\u5206\u4f48(1994\u5e7412\u6708~2017\u5e7406\u6708) - \u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78 \u9078\u8209\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3|website=esc.nccu.edu.tw|language=zh-tw|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> This has discouraged politicians from pursuing outright unification or independence, but rather moderate their stance towards maintain status quo.

The rise of a [[Taiwan independence movement|pan-Taiwanese independence movement]] with mainly of younger members, that does not acknowledge that existence of the 1992 consensus and hence claims that Taiwan is already independent, has challenged the status quo and called for greater ROC sovereignty in multilateral politics and economics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/04/11/taiwan-independence-china-republic-huadu-taidu/|title='Taiwan Independence' Doesn't Mean What You Think|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> As a result, the return of the KMT into power will likely be predicated on a more careful maintenance of pragmatic diplomacy which foreseeably involves drawing Taiwan closer to the PROC through a variety of methods, such as sharing social spaces in international institutions, making diplomatic visits, signing economic deals. In each case, the KMT must promise to keep a safe distance in order to reflect the beliefs of a vigilant populace. To further exacerbating this tension, the KMT has also suffered from undemocratic perceptions, after its evasion of a clause by clause review of the [[Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement]], which prompted the [[Sunflower Student Movement]] to damage the party's credibility. In the future, the KMT must improve transparency to rebuild trust between it and the Taiwanese populace.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/the-sunflower-movement-and-the-2016-taiwan-presidential-elections/|title=The 'Sunflower Movement' and the 2016 Taiwan presidential elections|access-date=2018-01-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Deteriorating Relationship with the PRC ===\nIn recent years, the KMT has been gradually falling out of China's favor. Following the [[2016 Taiwan general election|KMT election loss of 2016]], the KMT began to shift its pro-China policy towards the median to better represent the view of the electorate. In short, they began campaigning under the ideal of [[multiculturalism]], which included both \u201cChinese\u201d and \u201cTaiwanese\u201d citizens. However, this change in the party line was criticized by China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccpwatch.org/single-post/2017/10/16/Dwindling-Confidence-Is-the-CCPs-View-of-the-KMT-Changing|title=Party Watch Initiative|website=Party Watch Initiative|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> Beijing's preoccupation with the process of \u201clocalization\u201d stems from concerns over the ROC's move towards \u201cDe-Sinification\u201d which would weaken the PRC's claim that people on both sides of the strait share common bond and heritage. Moreover, China views current DPP president [[Tsai Ing-wen]] as a dangerous player who threatens the 1992 Consensus, blaming the KMT for mismanagement of domestic and international policy which led to their 2016 election loss. In the future, the KMT must also struggle to balance the preferences of the overall electorate while also treading a thin line with Mainland China.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Elections in Taiwan]]\n* [[Kuomintang]]\n* [[History of the Republic of China]] \n* [[Politics of the Republic of China|Politics of Taiwan]]\n* [[List of political parties in the Republic of China|List of political parties in Taiwan]]\n* [[Conservatism in South Korea]]\n* [[Conservatism in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Liberalism in Taiwan]]\n* [[KMT retreat to Taiwan in 1949]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Conservatism in Taiwan| ]]\n[[Category:Politics of the Republic of China]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Political ideologies focused on the One-China policy}}\n{{Use American English|date = February 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date = February 2019}}\n{{unfocused|date=June 2018}}\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->'''Conservatism in Taiwan''' is a broad political philosophy which espouses the [[One-China policy]] as a vital com<nowiki/>ponent for the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (ROC)]]'s international security and economic development, as opposed to [[Taiwanization]] and Taiwanese sovereignty. Fundamental conservative ideas are grounded in [[Confucianism|Confucian values]] and  strands of Chinese philosophy associated with [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s teachings, a large centralized government which intervenes closely in the lives of individuals on both social and economic levels, and the construction of unified [[Sinocentrism|Sinocentric national identity]]. Conservative ideology in Taiwan constitutes the character and policies of the [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang (KMT)]] party and that of the [[Pan-Blue Coalition|pan-blue camp]].\n\n__TOC__\n\n== Overview: Three spheres of Conservative Policy ==\n\n=== Cross-Strait Policy ===\nThe relationship between the Republic of China (ROC) and the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] is Taiwan's main concern in foreign affairs. In a broad sense, the conservative Cross-Strait stance adheres to the notion of One-China, represented by the Kuomintang (KMT). However, the integration of this [[One-China|One-China philosophy]] into the party line has changed considerably. By the end of [[Chiang Kai-shek|Chiang Kai-shek\u2019]]<nowiki/>s presidency, the agenda of radical pro-unification via military force has slowly devolved into the desire for peaceful and strategic, albeit competitive coexistence rather than outright contention. Over time, the latter strategy has consolidated into the [[One China principle|One-China principle]] as a result of the [[1992 Consensus]], which proposed a unified entity comprising both Taiwan and the Mainland, while leaving the issue of representation open to interpretation. From a comparative standpoint, conservatives derive economic and security benefits from communication with the PRC, while warning against Taiwan's isolation and insecurity implied under [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwanese sovereignty.]] For Taiwan's political conservatives, the status quo is less than optimal, but at least better than independence from the PROC.\n\n=== Domestic Policy ===\nConservative domestic policy in Taiwan reflects a strong government at the center of policy and decision-making, in which the state takes initiative for individuals and closely intervenes in their daily lives. This runs counter to [[Western conservatism|Western political conservatism]], which supports a [[small government]] that operates on the perimeter of social life in order to respect the liberty of citizens. As such, conservative KMT policies may also be characterized by a focus on maintaining the traditions and doctrine of Confucian thought, namely reinforcing the morals of paternalism and patriarchy in Taiwan's society. Moreover, conservatism focuses on preserving the safety of the status quo under the [[One China principle|One-China principle]], which embodies the traditional political thought of the KMT party, as opposed to the uncertainty of change under the opposition parties' associated pro-independence movement. On a broader level, political conservatism within Taiwan revolves around building and later, preserving a unified Chinese national identity based on [[Sinocentrism]]. Similar to the threat of multiculturalism which governs one primary concern for western conservatives  i.e. United States,  KMT policies are against the integration of [[Taiwanese aborigines|Aboriginal culture]] into the mainstream Chinese identity.\n\n=== Economic Policy ===\nIn terms of [[Economic policy|economic policies]], [[conservatism]] in [[Taiwan]] can be described as highly interventionist. The national economy is centrally planned for the purpose of development and little separation between state and society exists. That opposes the general notion of economic conservatism, where little to no [[Economic interventionism|government intervention]] in the economic affairs is desired. This ideological difference stems from the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] roots of Taiwanese conservatism. Following the notion of Confucian [[Paternalistic conservatism|paternalism]], where the father is the head of the family, conservatives see the state as the head of society. As such, the state has to ensure the well-being of the population by promoting development and interfering in the economic affairs. Examples of conservative policies include the 1949-1953 Land Reforms, the 1950-1968 Economic Reforms aimed at encouraging production for export, the [[Ten Major Construction Projects]] and the establishment of the [[Three Links|Three Direct Links]] with [[China]].\n\n== Origins and Philosophy  ==\n\n=== Socioreligious tradition of Confucianism ===\nThere are four basic elements of [[Confucianism]] which apply to conservatist governance. The [[Paternalism|Paternalistic State]] entails top-down decision making under the notion that the \u201cFather is the head of the house, and likewise, the state the head of society.\u201d Leaders possess, ''[[Jen (Confucianism)|jen]]'', a supreme virtue representing human qualities at their best which determines their right to rule. The idea of s''ocial order and harmony'' translates into the assumption of the benevolent state - ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|ren/humaneness]],'' with which civil society works together - ''shu/reciprocity,'' rather than oppose, monitor, and scrutinize.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Chun-chieh|last2=Wu|first2=Kung-ming|date=|title=Taiwan and the Confucius Aspiration: Towards the Twenty-first Century|url=http://huang.cc.ntu.edu.tw/pdf/CCB1306.pdf|journal=NTU Databases|volume=3|pages=72\u201386|via=ntu.edu.tw}}</ref> The [[Patriarchy|Notion of Patriarchy]] positions men as leaders, and women as passive. Confucius and [[Mencius]], in the [[Three Obediences and Four Virtues|''three obediences'']] depict obedience to the father and elder brothers when young, to the husband when married, and to the sons when widowed. Finally, c''ollectivity'' captures the absence of the tradition of celebrating the individual in contrast to the United States. Instead, hierarchy is respected because it reflects naturally ordained positions in society. Moreover, the fulfilment of individual duties in a given position is necessary for the function of society.\n\n=== Sun Yat-sen's Political Perspectives ===\nMany of the Kuomintang's policies were inspired by its founder [[Sun Yat-sen]]\u2019s vision, and his ''[[Three Principles of the People]]'': nationalism (\u6c11\u65cf\u4e3b\u7fa9), democracy (\u6c11\u6b0a\u4e3b\u7fa9) and people\u2019s livelihood (\u6c11\u751f\u4e3b\u7fa9). These [[Three Principles of the People|three principles]] combine to make Taiwan a free, powerful, and prosperous nation, although they are selectively interpreted in a specific context which deviates from Sun Yat-sen's original intent. For example, during Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s rule and much of [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]\u2019s, the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian state]] overshadowed democracy by censoring the people\u2019s voice. However, most of his political ideas which were later adapted by his successors in governing Taiwan included equalization of land ownership, learning Chinese traditional morality through Confucian values, and the regulation of state capital by national corporations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&post=6996|title=Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Political Philosophy - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=1965-04-01|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==  Chronology of Kuomintang governments   ==\n\n=== Chiang Kai-shek (1945\u20131975) ===\n{{Main|Chiang Kai-shek}}\n[[File:\u8523\u4e2d\u6b63\u8096\u50cf(\u4e0a\u8272).jpg|thumb|President Chiang Kai-shek]]\n\n==== Cross-Strait Policy ====\nChiang Kai-shek`s retreat to Taiwan following the [[Chinese Civil War]], and the subsequent establishment of the ROC in December 1949, marked the beginning of the One-China party line.  In Taiwan, the KMT immediately insisted on its right to maintain the position of the legal representative of all of China. The \u201cgovernment in exile\u201d, a term the ROC under Chiang Kai-shek elected to call itself, remained a status recognized by the international community until October 1971, when Taiwan's seat in the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] was replaced by that of the PRC, and February 1972, which marked [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China|Nixon's historical visit to Peking]] which ended in the shocking [[Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9|Shanghai Communique.]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Republic of China under Chiang Kai-Shek: Taiwan Today .|last=Lumley|first=F.A.|publisher=|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the KMT sought to bide time and strength under US assistance and protection in order to retake the mainland. The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] prompted [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] to order the Seventh Fleet to defend Taiwan against the possibility of invasion on June 27, 1950.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Taiwan under Chiang Kai Shek's Era: 1945-1976|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/Sinologie/repository/uePRDemokrUIdentTaiwanSeit1980/Cheng_TaiwanUnderChiangKai-shek_sEra1945-1976.pdf|journal=Asian Profile|volume= 16| issue =  4|pages=299\u2013315|via=}}</ref> Although the US overall goal was not to aid Chiang's return to the mainland, but to build Taiwan into a fortress against communism, it allowed Chiang to pursue his military vision of reunification.\n\nAs a staunch [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], Chiang pushed his doctrine of pro-reunification under the ideology of liberating the mainland from the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] using force. Hence, the army of civilians, legal specialists, troops, and other skilled workers that came with him viewed Taiwan as a temporary base for building industrial and military strength towards the level necessary to retake the mainland. In August 1955, and later in 1958, Chiang demonstrated his commitment for settling KMT-[[Communist Party of China|Communist Party of China (CCP)]] representative rivalry with military force by instigating conflict along the Tachen, Kinmen and Matsu islands in the [[First Taiwan Strait Crisis]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Jinghua|date=November 2011|title=Taiwan's Role in the Breakout of the Taiwan Strait Crises: A Historical Perspective|url=http://isdp.eu/content/uploads/publications/2011_lu_taiwans-role-in-the-breakout.pdf|journal=Institute for Security and Development Policy|volume=|pages=6\u201315|via=}}</ref> The PROC began shelling the islands in response to Chiang's deployment of approximately 60,000 armed troops into the area, which prompted the [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]]. In the 1960s smaller skirmishes were accompanied by unconventional strategies aimed at the liberation of China. Chiang Kai-shek deployed planes which dropped leaflets and sent the air force on reconnaissance and espionage missions i.e. blowing up bridges and infrastructure in the mainland. Nevertheless, the 1970s was marked by [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]], signaling Taiwan's decline in the international community, and with it, the desire to recapture the mainland was replaced by the necessity to survive under the new unstable status quo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idsa.in/idsastrategiccomments/TaiwansFailureattheUN_JPPanda_240908|title=Taiwan's Failure at the UN {{!}} Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|website=idsa.in|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==== Domestic Policy ====\nThe KMT's [[One-China policy]] also influenced its governing policy in Taiwan. Dealing with the island's weakening economy after a long period of prosperity under the Japanese, as well as the residents\u2019 dissatisfaction of KMT's administration, Chiang Kai-shek decided on consolidating his dominance through an authoritarian political system to stabilize Taiwan's internal affairs, opening path for reunification with Mainland.\n\nStructure-wise, the government of Chiang imposed on Taiwan was of little difference than the [[Government of the Republic of China|previous form used to administer Mainland China]].

Their goal was to change the Japanese colonial laid rental system which promoted unfair distribution of land and contributed to the gap between rich and poor. The reforms aimed at making all farmers the owners of their own fields.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=10,23,45,10&post=15716|title=Land-to-the-tiller program transformed Taiwan - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=2009-08-28|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> The reforms consisted of three stages. First, compulsory reduction of land rent, which limited farm rents to a maximum of 37,5 percent of the annual yield of the main crops. The second stage - sale of public land, that was previously owned and confiscated from Japanese colonists, to actual tenants at a price significantly below market value. The final third stage - the \u201cLand-to-the-Tiller Act\u201d, under which land owned by landlords in excess of 2,9 hectares was compulsorily sold to the government, which in turn resold it to tenants.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Samuel P.S.|date=1987|title=Economics, Economic Bureaucracy, and Taiwan's Economic Development|jstor=2758133|journal=Pacific Affairs|volume=60|issue=2|pages=226\u2013247|doi=10.2307/2758133}}</ref> These reforms touched a vast majority of the Taiwanese agricultural population, with 70% of tenant households having their rents reduced in the first stage. The second and third stages also contributed to reducing the land farmed by tenants from 44% in 1949 to 17% in 1953.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/1582258/land-reform-in-taiwan|title=Land Reform in Taiwan by Chen Cheng, 1961 {{!}} Online Research Library: Questia|website=www.questia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>\n\nEconomically, the reforms were important as with the change of ownership, the incentive framework of the cultivator was transformed - promoting an increase of work efforts, production, investment and adoption of new technologies. This rising productivity was necessary for the subsequent transfer of resources - labor and capital, to other sectors of the economy.<ref name=\":0\" /> The reforms also brought an impact to the income distribution, improving the incomes of tenants and new owners. It is argued that such policy of distribution first, and growth later also contributed to the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] growth pattern of the country.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Chiang Ching-kuo (1975\u20131988) ===\n{{Main|Chiang Ching-kuo}}\n[[File:ChiangChingkuo photo.jpg|thumb|255x255px|President Chiang Ching-kuo]]\n\n==== Cross-Strait Policy ====\nTaiwan under KMT president Chiang Ching-kuo embodied a move towards more flexible Cross-Strait relationship in an era of official diplomatic isolation, launched by the [[Dates of establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China|US recognition of the PRC]] on January 1, 1979.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/united-states-announces-that-it-will-recognize-communist-china|title=United States announces that it will recognize communist China - Dec 15, 1978 - HISTORY.com|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>  While Chiang Kai-shek's original One-China philosophy maintained Taiwan as its sole legitimate representative, a stance at the time recognized by the international community, his son, confronted by Taiwan's declining international status and the rise of China's power and relevance, could no longer maintain the same hard stance and openly hostile policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=10,23,45,10&post=14527|title=Book explores Taiwan's 'pragmatic' approach to foreign policy-making - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=2007-07-06|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> Thus, the KMT under Kuo shifted its interpretation of One-China  to the notion of representative rivalry within its current [[Cross-Strait relations]], which expresses Taiwan's necessity to negotiate for its relevance and its concessions made in other foreign arenas in light of the CPP's competing claim of representation.\n\nUnder the One-China line, Chiang Ching-kuo negotiated for its own security in order to compete with the PRC's growing power. As such, he filled the void of formal diplomatic ties to other countries with unofficial ties, sharing the modern paradigm of [[Foreign relations of Taiwan|Taiwan's foreign relations.]] Chiang Ching-kuo's responded bitterly to the severing of official relations in 1979 and the termination of the [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty|Mutual Defense Treaty]], causing him to reiterate his five principles with regard to ROC-US relations under the banner of \u201creality, continuity, security, legality, and governmentality.\" As a result, the United States Congress pushed the [[Taiwan Relations Act]] on Oct. 10 the same year. The act was an unofficial brokerage which allowed the US to deal with external threats to Taiwan and to sell arms for the purpose of defense building.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yeh|first=Chung-lu|date=April 2014|title=Policy Brief III: Taiwan Relations Act: Time For A Change?|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/TRAPolicyBrief.Lu__0.pdf|journal=Policy Brief Series: Wilson Center|volume=Three|pages=2\u20138|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the \u201c[[Three Noes]]\u201d: no contact, no compromise, no negotiation, with the PROC was adopted in response to the ROC's \u201cThree Links\u201d and maintained by president Kuo.

Due to China's complaints regarding the term Chinese Taiwan, and the registering of athletes as Chinese athletes, Taiwan adopted \"Chinese Taipei\"  - a term that silently endorsed the One-China principle, and resembled a compromise of representation to which both parties were satisfied.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/the-curious-case-of-taiwan-and-chinese-taipei/1128282|title=The curious case of Taiwan and Chinese Taipei|work=outlookindia.com/|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> This was a pragmatic move toward regaining international space for the ROC, one which embodied a move toward reunification.\n\n==== Domestic Policy ====\nIn light of growing domestic pro-democracy sentiment, abandonment by the international community - starting from the United States\u2019 decision to not recognize the ROC diplomatically, and China's rising power and international status, Chiang Ching-kuo initiated various strategic, limited democratic concessions in order to consolidate KMT authority against internal and external pressures. Doing so would allow the KMT to strategically continue as a strong state under the semblance of democracy, while also enabling the ROC securely allocate attention abroad in negotiating its One-China policy. Ultimately, human rights issues still remained a major controversy in this era, given that Chiang Ching-kuo kept the main policies of his father's reign alive. However, the [[Martial law in Taiwan|Martial Law]], the product of his father's security concerns of a communist rebellion was eventually lifted in 1987.\n\nChiang Ching-kuo's gradual switch from ethnic Chinese conservatism to Taiwanese conservatism began with reshuffling the cabinet to include more ethnically Taiwanese members, albeit on a small scale.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Taiwan: A New History|last=Rubinstein|first=Murray A.|publisher=M.E.

While Chiang Ching-kuo began slowly relaxing restraints on political opposition, \u201cTang-wai\u201d was already earning large support from local elections in the end of the 1970s; much to the extent that after [[Kaohsiung Incident]] in 1979, the KMT initiated stricter surveillance, and capture, of opposition members.<ref name=\":6\" /> As political activism in the 1980s attracted more and more Taiwanese, the KMT government started carrying out open policies to encourage participation of the remaining population, such as including new  talents and religious people.<ref name=\":6\" /> A prominent example would be Chiang's decision to pick [[Lee Teng-hui]], an original Taiwanese, to be the country's vice-president in 1982.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite thesis |last=Hansson |first=Ulf |date=2007 |title=Chiang Ching-Kuo A Motive Analysis |type=Bachelor |publisher=Lund University |url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/1319621}}</ref> In, 1986, Chiang Ching-kuo did the unthinkable: he flouted the KMT by allowing the illegal formation of the [[Democratic Progressive Party|Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)]]. These policies demonstrate that Chiang Ching-kuo sought to gain international support in order to strengthen his regime, by taking the moral high ground of democratic legitimacy against the rising threat of China. In doing so, he also sought to appease the United States for finance and security reasons.\n\nAnother element of Chiang Ching-kuo's era represented the continued exclusion of [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal people of Taiwan]] for fear of polluting Sinocentric national identity. Although the DPP was formed, it was never based on the intention of restoring rights of Aboriginals, but rather as a front to dissipate anger and satisfaction. Furthermore, there were no policies set in motion to return land stolen under Chiang Kai-shek, lift the ban addressing Aboriginal languages, or provide education in schools to continue Aboriginal culture. Only after democratic consolidation occurred after Chiang Ching-kuo, were aboriginal rights restored. In tandem with maintaining a strict Sino-centric identity, as Chiang Ching-kuo and his men were attempting to introduce a new brand of conservatism to the party structure, on the nationwide scale the government was still labeled authoritarian conservative.\n\n==== Economic Policy ====\nThe 1970s was period of rapid economic development for the Taiwanese economy. The government realized that the existing infrastructure was reaching its maximum capacity and was no longer able to accommodate the economy's needs. Chiang Ching-kuo became the driving force behind the proposal of the first post war large-scale infrastructure construction, namely the [[Ten Major Construction Projects]]. They included six projects covering highway, rail, sea and air transportation infrastructure, and others - shipbuilding, oil refining, steel manufacturing and nuclear power generation. The work on the projects started in the early 1970s while Chiang was still a Premier and most of the projects were completed by the end of the decade.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=8,8,29,32,32,45&post=13964|title=Building the Economy of the Future - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=2011-06-01|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> The construction significantly contributed to mitigating the effects of the 1973 oil crisis, such as spiking unemployment resulting from factory closures.

Thus, his contributions to Conservatism must be carefully limited to the economy sphere. Indeed, throughout his presidency, Lee rejected the \u201c1992\u201d Consensus\" under the claim that China's characterization of Taiwan as a \"renegade province\u201d embodied a straw man argument. Instead, he considered Taiwan as having always remained historically independent, under the observation of the [[Treaty of San Francisco|San-Francisco Treaty.]] Such a radical stance worried China to the extent in which military sanctions were used, prompting the outbreak of the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis]].\n\n==== Domestic Policy ====\nDue to being regarded as the pioneer of the liberalization ofTaiwanese politics, many internal policies under Lee's presidency did not follow the conservative political line traditional to KMT. During his rule, he actively promoted democracy by removing permanent members of the Legislative Yuan - namely the Mainlanders in power since 1949, as well as holding free elections afterwards to include more Taiwanese members. He emphasized his ethnically Taiwanese identity in his rule, crafting a stronger sense of [[Taiwanization|Taiwanese nationalism]] following his predecessor Chiang Ching-kuo's steps.\n\n==== Economic Policy ====\nDuring the 1990s the Taiwanese government actively pursued monitoring and control over the cross-strait investments. Various regulations were implemented, such as requiring all firms that were investing in the mainland to report the amount and the nature of their investments. If they failed to do so, variety of punishments were awaiting - including denying permissions to travel, cutting off credits and exchange operations, denying future investment applications.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|jstor=10.7249/mg507osd.11|title=Chinese Economic Coercion Against Taiwan|journal=Chinese Economic Coercion Against Taiwan|date=2007|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=9780833039699|editor-last=Tanner|editor-first=Murray Scot|edition=1|series=A Tricky Weapon to Use|pages=33\u201372|last1=Tanner|first1=Murray Scot}}</ref> Regulations also prescribed that new investments over 1 million USD would require advance approval, further strengthening the government's ability to oversee the mainland related economic activities.\n\nThis period was also marked by a major shift in the Taiwanese investments - from-small scale manufacturing and mostly labor-intensive industries, such as apparel, footwear, food processing, to higher technology production and infrastructure projects. As a result, the value of investments increased greatly, bringing up the government's fears of Taiwan's growing reliance on the mainland. In response, President [[Lee Teng-hui]] asserted that the country's excessive dependence upon overseas investment, particularly in the PRC, was diverting capital and attention from revitalizing the domestic economy, and the government might have to put a lid on it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fletcher Matthew|first=Eyton Laurence|date=August 1996|title=A Sharp Change of Course: President Lee and Big Business Spar Over China|url=|journal=Time Magazine|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> One of the new strategies to diversify Taiwanese investments in other less hostile markets, was the \u201cGo South\u201d policy that encouraged outsourcing production in [[Southeast Asia]]. This policy however didn\u2019t produce the needed results and reduce the investments to the mainland.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSeeing the weaknesses of the \u201cGo South\u201d strategy, the government took another approach introducing the \u201cNo Haste, Be Patient\u201d policy. It required case-by-case approvals of Taiwanese investments in high-technology and infrastructure in the mainland. Also, it imposed limits on investments in the [[China|PRC]] - with a maximum investment level of 20 to 40 percent of a firm's total net worth and a ceiling of 50 million USD on individual investments.<ref name=\":2\" /> A following regulation also banned Taiwanese investment in most large-scale infrastructure and energy projects. It was argued that the policy's objective was not to stop entirely the movement towards the mainland, but to slow and manage the outflow of high-tech firms and give them the opportunity to develop at home. Lee also claimed that as long as Beijing was being hostile towards Taiwan, such unrestrained investments and excessive reliance on the mainland would undermine the national security.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nLee's policies were met with strong opposition - both from the business levels and the general electorate, which supported closer economic ties with the mainland, in spite of concerns over security threats and pressure from Beijing.\n\n=== Ma Ying-jeou (2008-2016) ===\n{{Main|Ma Ying-jeou}}\n[[File:Ma Ying-jeou official cropped.jpg|thumb|287x287px|President Ma Ying-jeou]]\n\n==== Cross-Strait Policy ====\nUnder the presidency of [[Ma Ying-jeou]], the 1992 consensus carried on, allowing Taiwan to silently maintain its representation of One-China. In the context of this stalemate, Ma then turned towards bolstering Taiwan's security and international position by implementing flexible diplomacy. As such, Ma's main vision was to slowly restore the ''[[modus vivendi]]'' in regard to the growing power and influence of the ROC by scaling down the hostile relationship which had greatly escalated during Lee Teng-hui's and [[Chen Shui-bian]]\u2019s presidencies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/03/16/former-taiwan-president-ma-on-one-china-the-1992-consensus-and-taiwans-future/|title=Former Taiwan president Ma on One China, the 1992 consensus, and Taiwan's future|last=Whelan-Wuest|first=Maeve|date=2017-03-16|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-01-13|language=en-US}}</ref> According to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Taiwan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] during Ma\u2019s presidency, the consensus represented the ROC\u2019s principles of \u201cdignity, autonomy, pragmatism, and flexibility\u201d in foreign affairs.

Ma administration's efforts of flexible diplomacy, which had not only principally maintained the 1992 consensus, but also brought the PROC and the ROC closer to ever before, induced political backlash as students occupied the National Parliament, demanding a clause by clause review of the agreement.

Following the growing desires and the increasing pressure from the business community, a few weeks after Ma's inauguration he initiated talks between Taiwan and the mainland regarding the issue of the [[Three Links|Three Direct Links]]. These are the three main paths of communication between Taiwan and PRC - via mail, transportation and commerce, which were banned between the two sides for almost six decades. The absence of the three links has been a huge barrier for Taiwanese businesses, increasing shipment costs and obstructing access to a potentially large market, low labor costs and talent pool in the mainland. It also prevented investment and development of multinational companies back in Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eai.nus.edu.sg/publications/files/BB415.pdf|title=The Economics of Taiwan's Three Direct Links with Mainland China|last=Chen|first=Chien-Hsun|date=27 November 2008|website=National University of Singapore}}</ref>\n\nFinally, on November 4, 2008 the two sides signed series of agreements regarding each link and Three Direct Links were established.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rieti.go.jp/en/china/09063001.html|title=China in Transition\u300cImproved Cross-Straits Relations under the Ma Ying-jeou Administration - A path to peaceful reunification -\u300d|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en}}</ref> The successful talks mark a historic moment signifying that cross-Strait relations have moved past hostility towards negotiation and cooperation. The opposition has been sceptical, repeatedly claiming that while such move might be economically beneficial for Taiwan, it is compromising the national security with Taiwanese airports being open to PRC aircraft. In reality however, because of this development, cross-strait relations have increasingly become oriented towards rapprochement rather than confrontation.\n\nAnother economic policy of Ma's government is the [[Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement]]. Signed in 2010, the Agreement aims to reduce tariffs and commercial barriers between the two-sides, with the hope for much-needed boost to Taiwan's economy. Yet, it was not received well by the public, giving start of protests and a fierce public debate over the effects of the agreement. Opponents have expressed concerns for the future of  the local economy, as Taiwanese workers and small businesses would have to compete with  increasing imports of cheaper Chinese goods. At the heart of the protests however, has been the fear that the ECFA might be led to reunification with Beijing, which sees the island as a Chinese province.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/27/world/la-fg-taiwan-protests-20100627|title=Taiwan trade pact with China fires up protesters|last=Sui|first=Cindy|date=2010-06-27|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> The President has asserted that the deal is about economics, not politics, and has affirmed his confidence over Taiwanese democracy and its ability to fend off undue pressure from the PRC.\n\n== Conservatives in Taiwan ==\n\n=== Political Parties ===\n{{Main|Pan-Blue Coalition}}\nThe Conservative parties in Taiwan or the so-called \u201c[[Pan-Blue Coalition|pan-blue camp]]\u201d includes the Kuomintang (KMT), the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party (PFP)]] and the [[New Party (Taiwan)|New Party (NP)]].\n\nKuomintang is the main conservative party and currently it is the largest opposition party in the Legislative Yuan with 35 seats.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/01/17/2003637386|title=ELECTIONS: DPP secures absolute majority in Legislative Yuan - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>\n\nPeople's First Party is a liberal conservative party, founded by former KMT General Secretary and Taiwan Provincial Governor [[James Soong]] after the 2000 presidential elections. It is the main contender with the KMT for the conservative votes. Currently, it holds 3 seats in the Legislative Yuan.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe [[New Party (Taiwan)|New Party]] was also established as a split from the KMT in 1993, after growing dissatisfaction with President Lee's policies of distancing the party from unification with the mainland. The NP has been a vanishing force in the political landscape, not having won any seats in the Legislative Yuan since the 2008 elections.\n\n=== Supporter Base ===\nInitially, the [[Pan-Blue Coalition|pan-blue camp]] and the [[Pan-Green Coalition|pan-green camp]] reflected the ideological differences within society over national identity. Those ideological differences were manifested through the different stances on cross-strait policy - with the blue-camp being pro-unification and the green-camp - pro-independence. Therefore, determining party affiliation was based on ethnicity and the attitude towards the relationship with the mainland.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jamestown.org/program/taiwans-election-results-reflect-shift-in-attitudes/|title=Taiwan's Election Results Reflect Shift in Attitudes - Jamestown|work=Jamestown|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}</ref> As a result, the pan-blue camp supporter base traditionally consisted of people mainly having Chinese identities and pro-unification attitudes.\n\nRecently however, it has been observed that the alignment with a party has grown beyond these traditional dichotomies. This has been influenced by the growth of a distinct Taiwanese identity, rooted not in ethno-cultural aspect, but in the historical, economic and political development of the island.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://esc.nccu.edu.tw/course/news.php?Sn=166#|title=\u516c\u544a\uff1a\u81fa\u7063\u6c11\u773e\u81fa\u7063\u4eba/\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba\u8a8d\u540c\u8da8\u52e2\u5206\u4f48(1992\u5e7406\u6708~2017\u5e7406\u6708\uff09 - \u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78 \u9078\u8209\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3|website=esc.nccu.edu.tw|language=zh-tw|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> The change has affected people's preferences, with a growing concern over each party's capability and will to maintain what is being considered Taiwanese identity. As a result of this tendency and in attempt to appeal to the growing group of people who identify as Taiwanese, the KMT has lost its idealistic pan-Chinese passion. To avoid marginalization, it has focused rather on practical steps of Sino-Taiwanese cooperation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Gunter|date=2004|title=Taiwan's Political Parties and National Identity: The Rise of an Overarching Consensus|jstor=10.1525/as.2004.44.4.534|journal=Asian Survey|volume=44|issue=4|pages=534\u2013554|doi=10.1525/as.2004.44.4.534}}</ref>\n\nAnother major concern for the citizens has become the parties capacity to retain the peace and stability across the Strait, with the majority of people preferring the status quo over unification or independence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://esc.nccu.edu.tw/course/news.php?Sn=167#|title=\u516c\u544a\uff1a\u81fa\u7063\u6c11\u773e\u7d71\u7368\u7acb\u5834\u8da8\u52e2\u5206\u4f48(1994\u5e7412\u6708~2017\u5e7406\u6708) - \u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78 \u9078\u8209\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3|website=esc.nccu.edu.tw|language=zh-tw|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> This has discouraged politicians from pursuing outright unification or independence, but rather moderate their stance towards maintain status quo. In the 2008 presidential campaign for example, KMT used status quo as a campaign tactics, eventually leading to its candidate Ma Ying-jeou being elected. However, in 2016 elections, the failure to do so, combined with [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]] utilizing the same \u201cstatus quo strategy\u201d cost the KMT the presidency.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-centrality-of-maintaining-the-status-quo-in-taiwan-elections/|title=The centrality of maintaining the status quo in Taiwan elections|last=Yu|first=Ching-hsin|date=2017-03-15|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, from those two tendencies - the growing Taiwanese identity and the steady preference over the maintaining the status quo with the mainland, the characteristics of the supporter base of the conservatives have become less clear cut than before.\n\n== Current Status ==\n\n=== Party Instability and Regaining Trust ===\nDomestically, conservatism within the KMT treads a thin line. The rise of a [[Taiwan independence movement|pan-Taiwanese independence movement]] with mainly of younger members, that does not acknowledge that existence of the 1992 consensus and hence claims that Taiwan is already independent, has challenged the status quo and called for greater ROC sovereignty in multilateral politics and economics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/04/11/taiwan-independence-china-republic-huadu-taidu/|title='Taiwan Independence' Doesn't Mean What You Think|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> As a result, the return of the KMT into power will likely be predicated on a more careful maintenance of pragmatic diplomacy which foreseeably involves drawing Taiwan closer to the PROC through a variety of methods, such as sharing social spaces in international institutions, making diplomatic visits, signing economic deals. In each case, the KMT must promise to keep a safe distance in order to reflect the beliefs of a vigilant populace. To further exacerbating this tension, the KMT has also suffered from undemocratic perceptions, after its evasion of a clause by clause review of the [[Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement]], which prompted the [[Sunflower Student Movement]] to damage the party's credibility. In the future, the KMT must improve transparency to rebuild trust between it and the Taiwanese populace.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/the-sunflower-movement-and-the-2016-taiwan-presidential-elections/|title=The 'Sunflower Movement' and the 2016 Taiwan presidential elections|access-date=2018-01-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Deteriorating Relationship with the PRC ===\nIn recent years, the KMT has been gradually falling out of China's favor. Following the [[2016 Taiwan general election|KMT election loss of 2016]], the KMT began to shift its pro-China policy towards the median to better represent the view of the electorate. In short, they began campaigning under the ideal of [[multiculturalism]], which included both \u201cChinese\u201d and \u201cTaiwanese\u201d citizens. However, this change in the party line was criticized by China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccpwatch.org/single-post/2017/10/16/Dwindling-Confidence-Is-the-CCPs-View-of-the-KMT-Changing|title=Party Watch Initiative|website=Party Watch Initiative|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> Beijing's preoccupation with the process of \u201clocalization\u201d stems from concerns over the ROC's move towards \u201cDe-Sinification\u201d which would weaken the PRC's claim that people on both sides of the strait share common bond and heritage. Moreover, China views current DPP president [[Tsai Ing-wen]] as a dangerous player who threatens the 1992 Consensus, blaming the KMT for mismanagement of domestic and international policy which led to their 2016 election loss. In the future, the KMT must also struggle to balance the preferences of the overall electorate while also treading a thin line with Mainland China.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Elections in Taiwan]]\n* [[Kuomintang]]\n* [[History of the Republic of China]] \n* [[Politics of the Republic of China|Politics of Taiwan]]\n* [[List of political parties in the Republic of China|List of political parties in Taiwan]]\n* [[Conservatism in South Korea]]\n* [[Conservatism in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Liberalism in Taiwan]]\n* [[KMT retreat to Taiwan in 1949]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Conservatism in Taiwan| ]]\n[[Category:Politics of the Republic of China]]\n", "name_user": "Lakun.patra", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: didn\u2019t \u2192 didn't,  1 million USD \u2192  US$1 million (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_Taiwan"}
