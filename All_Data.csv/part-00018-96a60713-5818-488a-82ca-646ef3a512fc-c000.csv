'''Gosport''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɒ|s|p|ɔər|t}} {{respell|GOS|port}}) is a town in [[Hampshire]] on the south coast of the United Kingdom. At the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]], its population was 91,544<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=6275109&c=Gosport&d=13&e=62&g=6429974&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1428339590873&enc=1 |title=Area: Gosport (Local Authority): Key Figures for 2011 Census: Key Statistics |work=[[Neighbourhood Statistics]] |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> It is situated on a [[peninsula]] on the western side of [[Portsmouth Harbour]], opposite the city of [[Portsmouth]], to which it is linked by the [[Gosport Ferry]]. Gosport lies south-east of Fareham, to which it is linked by a [[South East Hampshire Bus Rapid Transit|Bus Rapid Transit]] route and the [[A32 road|A32]]. Until the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.

The town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]], as well as a Helicopter Repair base. The Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina. As part of the ''Renaissance of Portsmouth Harbour'' [[Millennium Commission|Millennium]] project, a large sundial, known as the Millennium Timespace, was installed on the harbour front in 2000.

==Name==
Though there are multiple theories which point towards the etymology of Gosport, it is widely purported to derive its name from \"goose\". An alternative etymology of \"gorse\" (from the bushes growing on local heathland) is not supported by the regional name for the plant, \"furze\". A third theory, claiming a derivation from \"God's Port\" is believed to be a 19th-century invention. This is, however, the slogan of Gosport as demonstrated on its emblem. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |last=Eley |first=Philip |title=The Place Names of Gosport, an unofficial portrayal |work=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007203501/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |archivedate=7 October 2008}}</ref>

==History==
The [[Rowner]] area of the peninsula was settled by the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]]s, and is mentioned in the ''[[Anglo Saxon Chronicle]]'' as Rughenor (\"rough bank or slope\"). Both Rowner and [[Alverstoke]], the name coming from the point where the River Alver entered [[the Solent]] at [[Stokes Bay]], were included in the [[Domesday Book]]. [[Rowner]] was the earliest known settlement of the peninsula, with many [[Prehistoric Britain#Mesolithic|Mesolithic]] finds and a hunting camp being found, and [[tumuli]] on the peninsula investigated. [[Bronze Age]] items found in a 1960s construction in {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} included a hoard of axe heads and torcs. A three-celled dwelling unearthed during construction of the Rowner naval Estate in the 1970s points to a settled landscape. Next to the River Alver which passes the southern and western edge of Rowner is a [[Norman England|Norman]] motte and bailey, the first fortification of the peninsula, giving a vantage point over the Solent, [[Stokes Bay]], [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] and the [[Isle of Wight]]. The former Rowner naval married quarters estate, now mostly demolished, and HMS ''Sultan'' were built on a former military airfield, known first as [[RAF Gosport]] and later as HMS ''Siskin'', which gives its name to the local infant and junior schools. The barracks at [[Browndown Battery|Browndown (Stokes Bay)]] were used in the ITV series ''[[Bad Lads' Army]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/gosport.html |last=Lambert |first=Tim |title=A Brief History of Gosport |work=A World History Encyclopedia |accessdate= }}</ref>

== Politics ==
The district is currently run by the Gosport Borough Council. Following the 2018 Borough Council elections, the political structure of the Council is as follows:

[[Caroline Dinenage]] currently serves as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament for Gosport, and has done so since 2010, after gaining a 48.0% majority vote in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]].

==Naval and military==
Until the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/towndefences.htm |title=The Gosport Town Defences |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> The first fortifications were in 1678 during the reign on Charles II. These consisted of two forts, Fort James and Fort Charles, and a series of bastions and double ditches to encircle the town, known as the Gosport Lines. During the Georgian period in 1751 and 1752 they were rebuilt, enlarged and extended. Further additions were made in response to the French invasion threat of 1779. By 1860, the Gosport Lines had 58 guns. No.1 Bastion, for example, had mounted 14 guns in brick lined emplacements firing over the parapet. The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defences of the United Kingdom proposed the completion of [[Palmerston Forts, Portsmouth|a line of forts]] to protect the outer approach to Gosport town, making the earlier defences redundant. However, they were retained to constrain any expansion of the town towards the new line of forts. From the 1890s road widening meant some parts of the ramparts and gates were demolished. Further sections were demolished in the 1920s and 1960s. Today, the little that remain are protected ancient monuments.

The town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]] as well as a Helicopter Repair base; however, Gosport's naval history is very long, and the town has several buildings of historic interest as well as connections with many people who became famous. Most of the former naval and military installations have closed since the [[Second World War]], leaving empty sites and buildings. In response to this, museums have opened, and many of the fortifications and installations (such as [[Fort Brockhurst]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (formerly an [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot|Armament Depot]], now the [[Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower]]) and the [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]] in Haslar Road) have been opened to the public as tourism and heritage sites. One of the more recent additions is the Diving Museum<ref>{{cite web |title=The Diving Museum |url=http://www.divingmuseum.co.uk |accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> at [[Stokes Bay Lines|No 2 Battery at Stokes Bay]] which is bidding to become the National Diving Museum for the British Isles.

Several sites have also been redeveloped to provide housing, including the New [[Barracks]] (opened 1859, renamed St George Barracks in 1947, having served as HMS ''St George'' during the Second World War; closed 1991),<ref>{{cite web |title=New Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012070951/https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |archive-date=12 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the [[Royal Clarence Yard|Royal Clarence]] [[Victualling Yard]] (opened 1828 on the site of an earlier [[Victualling Commissioners|victualling]] facility, closed 1992) and [[Royal Hospital Haslar]] (formerly the last military hospital of the UK: opened as a [[Royal Naval Hospital]] in 1753, later served other armed forces personnel and latterly the wider community of Gosport; closed as a military hospital in March 2007, the [[National Health Service|NHS]] withdrew in 2009 and the hospital closed). [[Forton Barracks]] (opened 1811, closed 1923, re-opened as {{HMS|St Vincent|Gosport shore establishment|6}} in 1923, closed 1969)<ref>{{cite web |title=Forton Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/fortonbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> was part-demolished and is now [[St Vincent College]].

There has also been extensive redevelopment of the harbour area as a marina.

====Graves of Turkish sailors 1850–51====
In November 1850, two ships of the Ottoman Navy, ''Mirat-ı Zafer'' and ''Sirag-i Bahri Birik'', anchored off the Hardway near Gosport. The visit lasted several months and during this time some of the members of the crew contracted cholera and were admitted to Haslar Hospital for treatment, where most of them died. In addition, some other sailors died because of training accidents. In total 26 died and were laid to rest in the grounds of Haslar. At the turn of the 20th century the bodies were exhumed and transferred to the R.N. Military Cemetery, Clayhall Road, in [[Alverstoke]].

====Preparations for the D Day Landings====
[[File:Allied Preparations For D-day H39000.jpg|thumb|Sherman tanks of the 13th/18th Hussars, embarking onto LCT-610, 3 June 1944]]
In the first week of June 1944, tanks, scout cars and wheeled vehicles of the [[Sherbrooke Hussars|Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment]], [[Canadian Army]] loaded [[Landing craft tank]]s in Gosport. Convoys of vehicles had been carefully concealed from German discovery in the areas further inland, and in daylight on 3 June moved through Titchfield and [[Stubbington]] to G3 Hard on the Gosport waterfront. There, the [[M4 Sherman]] tanks were backed into position in preparation for the Channel crossing. The initial plan was for the invasion to begin on 5 June, but bad weather, with the various vessels riding at anchor off Calshot in the Solent, delayed the plans by one day.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=LtCol HM |year=1958 |title=The Sherbrooke Regiment (12th Armoured Regiment) |place= |publisher=privately published |page= }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}</ref>

==Geography==
The Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina.

South of the centre is Haslar Creek, which flows into Portsmouth Harbour near the harbour mouth. The lowest part of Haslar Creek is called Haslar Lake; at its western end, the creek splits into two branches. These are called Workhouse Lake (the northern branch) and Stoke Lake (the southern branch). South East of Stoke Lake and along Gilkicker Point is the area of Clayhall.

West, Northwest and South of Stoke Lake is the district and village of [[Alverstoke]]. To the west of which is Browndown, where the River Alver flows into The Solent at Stokes Bay. Further west from Browndown point is the district of [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] with the former RNAS ''Daedalus'' which is now home to a hovercraft museum and several marine related businesses, and CEMAST College (Fareham College). It is also used as a base for glider clubs, light aeroplanes, [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|HM Coastguard]] heliport and police aircraft.

In the west of Gosport is the naval base HMS ''Sultan''. West of HMS ''Sultan'' is the district of Rowner which includes Alver Village.

There are several districts north, northwest and west of the town centre. These include areas that extend to the inland areas of the peninsula, [[Hardway, Hampshire|Hardway]] (including Priddy's Hard and [[Forton Lake]]) Elson, Brockhurst, Bridgemary and Rowner. Hoeford (A32 Gosport Road) is the most northwesterly area within Gosport, and ends at the boundary with the [[Borough of Fareham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosport.gov.uk/onlinemaps/ |title=Online maps |publisher=Gosport.gov.uk |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>

==Climate==
The climate of Gosport is milder than that of the surrounding areas, winter frosts being light and short-lived and snow quite rare. Temperatures rarely drop much below freezing, because the peninsula has water to the south and east. Portsdown Hill also protects the town from the cold northerly winds during the winter months. Located on the south coast, Gosport also receives more sunshine per annum than most of the UK. The average maximum temperature in January is 8C with the average minimum being 3C. The average maximum temperature in July is 21C, with the average minimum being 14C. The record high temperature is 32C and record low is -9C.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/SOLENT_M_R_S_C/38740.htm |title=Climate Solent M.R.S.C. |work=World Weather |publisher=TuTiempo.net |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>[[Portsmouth|Gosport climate information adapted from Portsmouth climate information.

==Transport==
Gosport is the [[List of largest towns in England without a railway station|largest town in Britain without an operational railway station]]. The [[Gosport Ferry]] provides quick access to [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station]], terminus of the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]] to [[London]]. Due to heavy traffic (see below) this ferry is very well used. At one time the Gosport Ferry Company operated steam ferries, until the arrival in 1966 of two identical (and then very modern) diesel ferries, named ''Gosport Queen'' and ''Portsmouth Queen''. In 1971 a third ferry called ''Solent Enterprise'' joined the fleet. She was a slightly larger, more luxurious version of the \"Queens\". The company now operates two new modern ferries along with the two 1966 veterans. The first was built in 2001 and is named ''Spirit of Gosport''. After the retirement of the ''Solent Enterprise'' in 2003, a second modern and slightly larger ferry was added to the fleet and was named the ''Spirit of Portsmouth''. All ferries have been able to carry cycles and motorcycles.

Gosport received its railway before Portsmouth, but it closed to passengers in 1953. In 1841 a railway opened between the [[London and Southampton Railway]] at {{rws|Eastleigh}} via {{rws|Fareham}} to Gosport, where a [[terminal station|terminus]] was built to an [[Italianate]] design of Sir [[William Tite]]. [[Gosport railway station]] was intended to serve Portsmouth across the water, but was sited at Gosport away from the harbour because the railway company was not allowed to breach either the [[Hilsea Lines]], defences at the northern end of [[Portsea Island]] protecting [[Portsmouth]], or the Gosport Lines protecting depots such as Royal Clarence Yard.

An extension to Royal Clarence Yard was opened in 1846, and branch lines to [[Stokes Bay]] (open from 1863 to 1915), and to [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] (open to passengers 1894 to 1931). Due to declining traffic, the connection to Fareham was closed for passenger services in 1953 and to freight traffic in 1969, although trains to the armament depot in Frater ran until the late 1970s.

The trackbed of the former Gosport – Fareham railway is now an exclusive fast bus route and cycle lane. Tite's station building has been retained for its historical and architectural value and has been converted into a small number of residential properties and offices. The main gate in Spring Garden Lane has been opened up for vehicle access. A further development of six terraced homes has been built at the north western end of the site linking with George Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802023136/http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 August 2012 |title=Gosport Railway |publisher=[[The Guinness Partnership|Hermitage Housing Association]]}}</ref>

Being a peninsula town without a railway system, Gosport relies heavily upon the major [[A32 road]] in and out of the town. Plans existed in the 1970s to widen the road to accommodate expected increases in traffic flow, but this did not take place. In the early 1990s a computerised system controlling traffic lights along the route was installed to improve the rate of flow of traffic but this failed to work and had to be switched off since it could not cope with the traffic volumes. Now, in the 21st century, the A32 is much the same as it was thirty years ago{{when|date=August 2019}} and the traffic using it has increased to such an extent that the journey time to the nearby M27, about {{convert|5|mi|0}}, can routinely take anything from 45 minutes and often longer at peak times between 07:30 & 09:00 and 16:00 & 18:30.

The station site was linked with the [[South Hampshire Rapid Transit]] scheme, which would have made use of the former railway route. However, due to Government refusal to fund the scheme, it was formally abandoned in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/press/2006/pr3190.html |title=Tram scheme to be formally abandoned |publisher=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112031656/http://www.hants.gov.uk/press/2006/pr3190.html |archivedate=12 January 2007 }}</ref> During 2010, construction started on the same route to provide a rapid bus route between the Holbrook area of Gosport and the town of Fareham. Now completed, regular service buses between Gosport and Fareham divert onto the new route avoiding lengthy queues on the A32 and speeding up commuting time between the towns for bus passengers.

A [[Greyhound racing in the United Kingdom|greyhound racing]] track called the Gosforth Greyhound and Whippet Track existed from April 1930 until June 1936 and held racing every Friday evening and Saturday afternoon. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the [[National Greyhound Racing Club]]) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File, page 417|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}</ref> The stadium was located on the Forton Road and distances raced were mainly over 400 yards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://greyhoundracingtimes.co.uk/2019/03/27/gosport/|title=Gosport|publisher=Greyhound Racing Times}}</ref>

==Tourism==
The Gosport peninsula has {{convert|17|mi}} of waterfront on [[Portsmouth Harbour]] and [[The Solent]] and is a maritime playground for all. The pebble beach at [[Stokes Bay]] slopes steeply into the sea and offers fine views of the shipping going in and out of [[Portsmouth]] and [[Southampton]] and the many pleasure craft from the many marinas along [[The Solent]] and the [[Isle of Wight]].
The town has three Marinas, (Gosport Marina, found North of the Highstreet; Haslar Marina, found South of the Highstreet near the former site of [[Royal Hospital Haslar]]; and Royal Clarence Marina which also has a Cruising Club.)
The town also has a strong military history – chiefly with the Royal Navy. The [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]] has exhibits including {{ship||Holland 1}} – the Royal Navy's first submarine and the Second World War submarine {{HMS|Alliance|P417|6}}.

[[Explosion!]] tells the story of naval firepower from gunpowder to modern missiles. This modern, interactive museum is housed in historic buildings at [[Priddy's Hard]], the Navy's former armaments depot, with views across Portsmouth Harbour.

[[Fort Brockhurst]] is one of the \"[[Palmerston Forts|Palmerston's Follies]]\", built in the 1850s to defend Portsmouth Harbour against threats of a French invasion. A central exhibition explains Palmerston's plans to defend the key naval port. Nearby is the Gosport Aviation Heritage Museum, dedicated to the development of the [[Royal Air Force]]. The fort is owned by [[English Heritage]].

Gosport is also home to [[Little Woodham]], aka \"The 1642 Living History Village\". The village exists to educate both children and adults about 17th century life at the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] and is open for the public to meet the villagers at certain times throughout the year.

In September 2016, the [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]] became the set for a scene in ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight]]'', which starred [[HMS Alliance (P417)|HMS ''Alliance'']]. The filming brought many locals to see what was occurring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/hollywood-stars-caught-on-camera-in-gosport-for-filming-of-new-transformers-movie-1-7603019|title=Hollywood stars caught on camera in Gosport for filming of new Transformers movie|website=Portsmouth.co.uk|accessdate=25 February 2017}}</ref>

'''Gosport''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɒ|s|p|ɔər|t}} {{respell|GOS|port}}) is a town in [[Hampshire]] on the south coast of the United Kingdom. At the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]], its population was 91,544<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=6275109&c=Gosport&d=13&e=62&g=6429974&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1428339590873&enc=1 |title=Area: Gosport (Local Authority): Key Figures for 2011 Census: Key Statistics |work=[[Neighbourhood Statistics]] |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> It is situated on a [[peninsula]] on the western side of [[Portsmouth Harbour]], opposite the city of [[Portsmouth]], to which it is linked by the [[Gosport Ferry]]. Gosport lies south-east of Fareham, to which it is linked by a [[South East Hampshire Bus Rapid Transit|Bus Rapid Transit]] route and the [[A32 road|A32]]. Until the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.

The town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]], as well as a Helicopter Repair base. The Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina. As part of the ''Renaissance of Portsmouth Harbour'' [[Millennium Commission|Millennium]] project, a large sundial, known as the Millennium Timespace, was installed on the harbour front in 2000.

==Name==
Though there are multiple theories which point towards the etymology of Gosport, it is widely purported to derive its name from \"goose\". An alternative etymology of \"gorse\" (from the bushes growing on local heathland) is not supported by the regional name for the plant, \"furze\". A third theory, claiming a derivation from \"God's Port\" is believed to be a 19th-century invention. This is, however, the slogan of Gosport as demonstrated on its emblem. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |last=Eley |first=Philip |title=The Place Names of Gosport, an unofficial portrayal |work=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007203501/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |archivedate=7 October 2008}}</ref>

==History==
The [[Rowner]] area of the peninsula was settled by the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]]s, and is mentioned in the ''[[Anglo Saxon Chronicle]]'' as Rughenor (\"rough bank or slope\"). Both Rowner and [[Alverstoke]], the name coming from the point where the River Alver entered [[the Solent]] at [[Stokes Bay]], were included in the [[Domesday Book]]. [[Rowner]] was the earliest known settlement of the peninsula, with many [[Prehistoric Britain#Mesolithic|Mesolithic]] finds and a hunting camp being found, and [[tumuli]] on the peninsula investigated. [[Bronze Age]] items found in a 1960s construction in {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} included a hoard of axe heads and torcs. A three-celled dwelling unearthed during construction of the Rowner naval Estate in the 1970s points to a settled landscape. Next to the River Alver which passes the southern and western edge of Rowner is a [[Norman England|Norman]] motte and bailey, the first fortification of the peninsula, giving a vantage point over the Solent, [[Stokes Bay]], [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] and the [[Isle of Wight]]. The former Rowner naval married quarters estate, now mostly demolished, and HMS ''Sultan'' were built on a former military airfield, known first as [[RAF Gosport]] and later as HMS ''Siskin'', which gives its name to the local infant and junior schools. The barracks at [[Browndown Battery|Browndown (Stokes Bay)]] were used in the ITV series ''[[Bad Lads' Army]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/gosport.html |last=Lambert |first=Tim |title=A Brief History of Gosport |work=A World History Encyclopedia |accessdate= }}</ref>

== Politics ==
The district is currently run by the Gosport Borough Council. Following the 2018 Borough Council elections, the political structure of the Council is as follows:

[[Caroline Dinenage]] currently serves as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament for Gosport, and has done so since 2010, after gaining a 48.0% majority vote in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]].

==Naval and military==
Until the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/towndefences.htm |title=The Gosport Town Defences |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> The first fortifications were in 1678 during the reign on Charles II. These consisted of two forts, Fort James and Fort Charles, and a series of bastions and double ditches to encircle the town, known as the Gosport Lines. During the Georgian period in 1751 and 1752 they were rebuilt, enlarged and extended. Further additions were made in response to the French invasion threat of 1779. By 1860, the Gosport Lines had 58 guns. No.1 Bastion, for example, had mounted 14 guns in brick lined emplacements firing over the parapet. The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defences of the United Kingdom proposed the completion of [[Palmerston Forts, Portsmouth|a line of forts]] to protect the outer approach to Gosport town, making the earlier defences redundant. However, they were retained to constrain any expansion of the town towards the new line of forts. From the 1890s road widening meant some parts of the ramparts and gates were demolished. Further sections were demolished in the 1920s and 1960s. Today, the little that remain are protected ancient monuments.

The town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]] as well as a Helicopter Repair base; however, Gosport's naval history is very long, and the town has several buildings of historic interest as well as connections with many people who became famous. Most of the former naval and military installations have closed since the [[Second World War]], leaving empty sites and buildings. In response to this, museums have opened, and many of the fortifications and installations (such as [[Fort Brockhurst]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (formerly an [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot|Armament Depot]], now the [[Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower]]) and the [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]] in Haslar Road) have been opened to the public as tourism and heritage sites. One of the more recent additions is the Diving Museum<ref>{{cite web |title=The Diving Museum |url=http://www.divingmuseum.co.uk |accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> at [[Stokes Bay Lines|No 2 Battery at Stokes Bay]] which is bidding to become the National Diving Museum for the British Isles.

Several sites have also been redeveloped to provide housing, including the New [[Barracks]] (opened 1859, renamed St George Barracks in 1947, having served as HMS ''St George'' during the Second World War; closed 1991),<ref>{{cite web |title=New Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012070951/https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |archive-date=12 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the [[Royal Clarence Yard|Royal Clarence]] [[Victualling Yard]] (opened 1828 on the site of an earlier [[Victualling Commissioners|victualling]] facility, closed 1992) and [[Royal Hospital Haslar]] (formerly the last military hospital of the UK: opened as a [[Royal Naval Hospital]] in 1753, later served other armed forces personnel and latterly the wider community of Gosport; closed as a military hospital in March 2007, the [[National Health Service|NHS]] withdrew in 2009 and the hospital closed). [[Forton Barracks]] (opened 1811, closed 1923, re-opened as {{HMS|St Vincent|Gosport shore establishment|6}} in 1923, closed 1969)<ref>{{cite web |title=Forton Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/fortonbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> was part-demolished and is now [[St Vincent College]].

There has also been extensive redevelopment of the harbour area as a marina.

====Graves of Turkish sailors 1850–51====
In November 1850, two ships of the Ottoman Navy, ''Mirat-ı Zafer'' and ''Sirag-i Bahri Birik'', anchored off the Hardway near Gosport. The visit lasted several months and during this time some of the members of the crew contracted cholera and were admitted to Haslar Hospital for treatment, where most of them died. In addition, some other sailors died because of training accidents. In total 26 died and were laid to rest in the grounds of Haslar. At the turn of the 20th century the bodies were exhumed and transferred to the R.N. Military Cemetery, Clayhall Road, in [[Alverstoke]].

====Preparations for the D Day Landings====
[[File:Allied Preparations For D-day H39000.jpg|thumb|Sherman tanks of the 13th/18th Hussars, embarking onto LCT-610, 3 June 1944]]
In the first week of June 1944, tanks, scout cars and wheeled vehicles of the [[Sherbrooke Hussars|Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment]], [[Canadian Army]] loaded [[Landing craft tank]]s in Gosport. Convoys of vehicles had been carefully concealed from German discovery in the areas further inland, and in daylight on 3 June moved through Titchfield and [[Stubbington]] to G3 Hard on the Gosport waterfront. There, the [[M4 Sherman]] tanks were backed into position in preparation for the Channel crossing. The initial plan was for the invasion to begin on 5 June, but bad weather, with the various vessels riding at anchor off Calshot in the Solent, delayed the plans by one day.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=LtCol HM |year=1958 |title=The Sherbrooke Regiment (12th Armoured Regiment) |place= |publisher=privately published |page= }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}</ref>

==Geography==
The Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina.

South of the centre is Haslar Creek, which flows into Portsmouth Harbour near the harbour mouth. The lowest part of Haslar Creek is called Haslar Lake; at its western end, the creek splits into two branches. These are called Workhouse Lake (the northern branch) and Stoke Lake (the southern branch). South East of Stoke Lake and along Gilkicker Point is the area of Clayhall.

West, Northwest and South of Stoke Lake is the district and village of [[Alverstoke]]. To the west of which is Browndown, where the River Alver flows into The Solent at Stokes Bay. Further west from Browndown point is the district of [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] with the former RNAS ''Daedalus'' which is now home to a hovercraft museum and several marine related businesses, and CEMAST College (Fareham College). It is also used as a base for glider clubs, light aeroplanes, [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|HM Coastguard]] heliport and police aircraft.

In the west of Gosport is the naval base HMS ''Sultan''. West of HMS ''Sultan'' is the district of Rowner which includes Alver Village.

There are several districts north, northwest and west of the town centre. These include areas that extend to the inland areas of the peninsula, [[Hardway, Hampshire|Hardway]] (including Priddy's Hard and [[Forton Lake]]) Elson, Brockhurst, Bridgemary and Rowner. Hoeford (A32 Gosport Road) is the most northwesterly area within Gosport, and ends at the boundary with the [[Borough of Fareham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosport.gov.uk/onlinemaps/ |title=Online maps |publisher=Gosport.gov.uk |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>

==Climate==
The climate of Gosport is milder than that of the surrounding areas, winter frosts being light and short-lived and snow quite rare. Temperatures rarely drop much below freezing, because the peninsula has water to the south and east. Portsdown Hill also protects the town from the cold northerly winds during the winter months. Located on the south coast, Gosport also receives more sunshine per annum than most of the UK. The average maximum temperature in January is 8C with the average minimum being 3C. The average maximum temperature in July is 21C, with the average minimum being 14C. The record high temperature is 32C and record low is -9C.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/SOLENT_M_R_S_C/38740.htm |title=Climate Solent M.R.S.C. |work=World Weather |publisher=TuTiempo.net |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>[[Portsmouth|Gosport climate information adapted from Portsmouth climate information.

==Transport==
Gosport is the [[List of largest towns in England without a railway station|largest town in Britain without an operational railway station]]. The [[Gosport Ferry]] provides quick access to [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station]], terminus of the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]] to [[London]]. Due to heavy traffic (see below) this ferry is very well used. At one time the Gosport Ferry Company operated steam ferries, until the arrival in 1966 of two identical (and then very modern) diesel ferries, named ''Gosport Queen'' and ''Portsmouth Queen''. In 1971 a third ferry called ''Solent Enterprise'' joined the fleet. She was a slightly larger, more luxurious version of the \"Queens\". The company now operates two new modern ferries along with the two 1966 veterans. The first was built in 2001 and is named ''Spirit of Gosport''. After the retirement of the ''Solent Enterprise'' in 2003, a second modern and slightly larger ferry was added to the fleet and was named the ''Spirit of Portsmouth''. All ferries have been able to carry cycles and motorcycles.

Gosport received its railway before Portsmouth, but it closed to passengers in 1953. In 1841 a railway opened between the [[London and Southampton Railway]] at {{rws|Eastleigh}} via {{rws|Fareham}} to Gosport, where a [[terminal station|terminus]] was built to an [[Italianate]] design of Sir [[William Tite]]. [[Gosport railway station]] was intended to serve Portsmouth across the water, but was sited at Gosport away from the harbour because the railway company was not allowed to breach either the [[Hilsea Lines]], defences at the northern end of [[Portsea Island]] protecting [[Portsmouth]], or the Gosport Lines protecting depots such as Royal Clarence Yard.

An extension to Royal Clarence Yard was opened in 1846, and branch lines to [[Stokes Bay]] (open from 1863 to 1915), and to [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] (open to passengers 1894 to 1931). Due to declining traffic, the connection to Fareham was closed for passenger services in 1953 and to freight traffic in 1969, although trains to the armament depot in Frater ran until the late 1970s.

The trackbed of the former Gosport – Fareham railway is now an exclusive fast bus route and cycle lane. Tite's station building has been retained for its historical and architectural value and has been converted into a small number of residential properties and offices. The main gate in Spring Garden Lane has been opened up for vehicle access. A further development of six terraced homes has been built at the north western end of the site linking with George Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802023136/http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 August 2012 |title=Gosport Railway |publisher=[[The Guinness Partnership|Hermitage Housing Association]]}}</ref>

Being a peninsula town without a railway system, Gosport relies heavily upon the major [[A32 road]] in and out of the town. Plans existed in the 1970s to widen the road to accommodate expected increases in traffic flow, but this did not take place. In the early 1990s a computerised system controlling traffic lights along the route was installed to improve the rate of flow of traffic but this failed to work and had to be switched off since it could not cope with the traffic volumes. Now, in the 21st century, the A32 is much the same as it was thirty years ago{{when|date=August 2019}} and the traffic using it has increased to such an extent that the journey time to the nearby M27, about {{convert|5|mi|0}}, can routinely take anything from 45 minutes and often longer at peak times between 07:30 & 09:00 and 16:00 & 18:30.

The station site was linked with the [[South Hampshire Rapid Transit]] scheme, which would have made use of the former railway route. However, due to Government refusal to fund the scheme, it was formally abandoned in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/press/2006/pr3190.html |title=Tram scheme to be formally abandoned |publisher=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112031656/http://www.hants.gov.uk/press/2006/pr3190.html |archivedate=12 January 2007 }}</ref> During 2010, construction started on the same route to provide a rapid bus route between the Holbrook area of Gosport and the town of Fareham. Now completed, regular service buses between Gosport and Fareham divert onto the new route avoiding lengthy queues on the A32 and speeding up commuting time between the towns for bus passengers.

Furthermore, Gosport has a model yachting lake that is known from all over the world with national and international events being held there every year. Boats sailed there include the Vane A class, Vane 36, 1 meter, multihull, dragon force and laser. Model yachting used to be the biggest sport in Britain{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} with people coming as far as New Zealand for races. Now it's one of only a few lakes in the world that still races vane steered boats, the more traditional kind without remote control or electricity, which purely relies on a steering device controlled by the wind.

A [[Greyhound racing in the United Kingdom|greyhound racing]] track called the Gosforth Greyhound and Whippet Track existed from April 1930 until June 1936 and held racing every Friday evening and Saturday afternoon. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the [[National Greyhound Racing Club]]) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File, page 417|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}</ref> The stadium was located on the Forton Road and distances raced were mainly over 400 yards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://greyhoundracingtimes.co.uk/2019/03/27/gosport/|title=Gosport|publisher=Greyhound Racing Times}}</ref>

==Tourism==
The Gosport peninsula has {{convert|17|mi}} of waterfront on [[Portsmouth Harbour]] and [[The Solent]] and is a maritime playground for all. The pebble beach at [[Stokes Bay]] slopes steeply into the sea and offers fine views of the shipping going in and out of [[Portsmouth]] and [[Southampton]] and the many pleasure craft from the many marinas along [[The Solent]] and the [[Isle of Wight]].
The town has three Marinas, (Gosport Marina, found North of the Highstreet; Haslar Marina, found South of the Highstreet near the former site of [[Royal Hospital Haslar]]; and Royal Clarence Marina which also has a Cruising Club.)
The town also has a strong military history – chiefly with the Royal Navy. The [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]] has exhibits including {{ship||Holland 1}} – the Royal Navy's first submarine and the Second World War submarine {{HMS|Alliance|P417|6}}.

[[Explosion!]] tells the story of naval firepower from gunpowder to modern missiles. This modern, interactive museum is housed in historic buildings at [[Priddy's Hard]], the Navy's former armaments depot, with views across Portsmouth Harbour.

[[Fort Brockhurst]] is one of the \"[[Palmerston Forts|Palmerston's Follies]]\", built in the 1850s to defend Portsmouth Harbour against threats of a French invasion. A central exhibition explains Palmerston's plans to defend the key naval port. Nearby is the Gosport Aviation Heritage Museum, dedicated to the development of the [[Royal Air Force]]. The fort is owned by [[English Heritage]].

Gosport is also home to [[Little Woodham]], aka \"The 1642 Living History Village\". The village exists to educate both children and adults about 17th century life at the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] and is open for the public to meet the villagers at certain times throughout the year.

In September 2016, the [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]] became the set for a scene in ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight]]'', which starred [[HMS Alliance (P417)|HMS ''Alliance'']]. The filming brought many locals to see what was occurring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/hollywood-stars-caught-on-camera-in-gosport-for-filming-of-new-transformers-movie-1-7603019|title=Hollywood stars caught on camera in Gosport for filming of new Transformers movie|website=Portsmouth.co.uk|accessdate=25 February 2017}}</ref>

She is best known for her popular rhyming stories for children, especially those illustrated by [[Axel Scheffler]], which include ''[[The Gruffalo]]'', ''[[Room on the Broom]]'' and ''[[Stick Man]]''. She originally wrote songs for children's television but has concentrated on writing books since the words of one of her songs, \"A Squash and a Squeeze\", were made into a children's book in 1993. Of her 184 published works, 64 are widely available in bookshops. The remaining 120 are intended for school use and include her Songbirds phonic reading scheme, which is part of the Oxford University Press's Oxford Reading Tree. I love this woman! She is an ICON. 

==Life and career==

=== Childhood ===
Donaldson was born in London and brought up in [[Hampstead]], London, with her younger sister Mary. The family occupied a Victorian three-storey house near [[Hampstead Heath]]. Her parents, sister and their pet cat Geoffrey lived on the ground floor, an aunt and uncle (and later their children, James and Kate) on the first floor and her grandmother on the second floor.

Donaldson's parents, James (always known as Jerry) and Elizabeth, met shortly before the Second World War, which then separated them for six years. Jerry, who had studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at [[Oxford University]], spent most of the war in a prisoner-of-war camp where his knowledge of German earned him the position of an interpreter. Elizabeth, also a good German speaker with a degree in languages, meanwhile did war work in the [[Women's Royal Naval Service|Wrens]].

After the war, they were reunited and married, and in 1950 they bought the Hampstead house together with Jerry's mother, his sister Beta and her husband Chris (the two men had met in the P.O.W. camp). When Donaldson was six her father contracted [[polio]] and thereafter was confined to a wheelchair, though he still led an active life, working as a lecturer in the [[Maudsley Hospital]]'s [[Institute of Psychiatry]], where he pioneered genetic studies using the model of identical twins brought up apart.

Elizabeth worked as a part-time secretary and helped her boss, Leslie Minchin, translate German [[lieder]] into English. It was a household of music and song: Elizabeth sang with the Hampstead Choral Society, Jerry played the cello in amateur string quartets, and both parents were active members of the Hampstead Music Club. Summer holidays were at Grittleton House in Wiltshire, where Jerry played his cello in a summer school for chamber music, while Julia and Mary romped around and put on musical shows with the other children.

Poetry also featured strongly in Donaldson's early life; she was given ''The Book of a Thousand Poems'' by her father when she was five years old, and her grandmother introduced her to [[Edward Lear]]’s nonsense rhymes. Donaldson attended New End Primary School and then [[Camden School for Girls]]. During her childhood and adolescence she acted (understudying the fairies in Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' at The [[Old Vic]] where she made the acquaintance of a young [[Judi Dench]] and [[Tom Courtenay]]), sang with the Children's Opera Group, and learned the piano.

A good linguist, she learned French and German at school and later picked up Italian through a summer tutoring job with a family in Naples, so that by the age of 19 she had a good grasp of all three languages.<ref name=\"Malcolm Donaldson, 2012\">Malcolm Donaldson, 2012</ref>

===University life===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2019}}

Donaldson studied Drama and French at [[Bristol University]] (1967–1970), graduating with a 2:1 honours degree. During her time there she acted in departmental productions and learnt the guitar. In 1968, she and her friend Maureen Purkis took part in the play ''I am not the Eiffel Tower'' with music composed by [[Colin Sell]], an accomplished young pianist who was studying Spanish and Portuguese at Bristol and who has gone on to appear in BBC Radio 4's ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]''. Sell's roommate Malcolm Donaldson, a medical student who played left-handed guitar and was a keen amateur actor, came to see the show and subsequently teamed up with Sell, Donaldson and Purkis to sing in the pubs during Bristol University [[Rag Week]] in early 1969. Almost immediately after this Donaldson and Purkis were seconded to live in Paris for six months as part of their degree course where they sang and played their guitars to café audiences for money. Malcolm joined them in the summer and the trio performed various songs by the [[Beatles]] and from musicals including ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.

After several weeks of busking in Paris, Malcolm followed Julia and Maureen to the Avignon Festival. Here his attempts to sleep on their youth hostel floor led to eviction and the trio moved out, sleeping in a camp site and even a field, by which time a deep friendship had been formed. During their time in Paris the group were spotted by a French entrepreneur who auditioned them. While nothing came of this Donaldson and Purkis penned a tune to the traditional French poem \"Metamorphosis\" specifically for the audition, the first time that Donaldson had composed a song for an occasion (apart from the childhood shows).

By December 1969 Julia and Malcolm had become an item. They began to supply cabaret for the occasional university social event, and in 1970 they visited America, travelling by Greyhound bus from the East to the West coast and busking in Seattle and San Francisco. On their return the duo played in restaurants and began to participate in events as diverse as the [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] Children's Day, an Easter Parade in London and a dental congress dinner – with Julia Donaldson composing songs specially for these occasions.

===1970s===

The couple continued to busk in Europe during holidays, including in France and Italy, with Julia Donaldson writing \"The French Busking Song\" in French, and \"The Spaghetti Song\" in Italian. By 1971, Donaldson was working in London at Michael Joseph publishers as a secretary to Anthea Joseph but was also given considerable leeway as a junior editor. At weekends she and Malcolm took part in the Bristol Street Theatre, a group of mainly postgraduate students inspired by the late playwright David Illingworth. The group devised simple, unscripted plays which could be performed in the playgrounds of poor council estates and which recruited children from the audience to take over some of the roles. This was to have a lasting effect on Donaldson's interaction with children in her own shows as an established children's writer.

The couple were married in September 1972, Donaldson composing an operetta which she and Malcolm, their best man Colin Sell, the bridesmaids and ushers performed at the reception in [[Burgh House]], Hampstead. A picture of the wedding is on display in the house today. Donaldson then worked as a secretary in [[Radio Bristol]] where she also had a weekly slot as short story producer/editor. In August 1974 the couple moved to Brighton where Donaldson had been appointed as editor at Robert Tyndall, a small book publishers. Shortly before this she had sent a tape of songs to BBC Children's Television, and between 1974 and 1978 she wrote regularly for the programme ''[[Play Away]]'', her songs being performed by actors and musicians including [[Toni Arthur]], [[Floella Benjamin]], [[Johnny Ball]], [[Brian Cant]], [[Derek Griffiths]] and musical director [[Jonathan Cohen (musician)|Jonathan Cohen]]. She also wrote occasional songs for ''[[Play School (UK TV series)|Play School]]'' and for the ''[[Watch with Mother]]'' programme ''Play Board''. Some of Donaldson's songs – \"The Luck of the Game\", \"Funny Face\" and \"A Squash and a Squeeze\" – were recorded at this time for BBC albums.

Julia and Malcolm were involved in the Brighton folk club scene, performing floor spots of comedy songs written by Donaldson, often within days of being composed. The songs were variously influenced by [[Flanders and Swann]], topical affairs and traditional folk tales (the latter inspiring spoofs such as \"The Ballad of Jack Nancy and Fred\", and \"Folk Alphabet\"). Their vinyl album ''First Fourteen''(1977) featured many of these songs, while others were included much later on the CD ''Second Fourteen'' (2006, when  ''First Fourteen'' was also re-mastered as a CD).

Donaldson composed two musicals for children: ''King Grunt's Cake'' (1976) and ''Pirate on the Pier'' (1980) which she and a small cast performed both in London and Brighton. Influenced by their Bristol Street Theatre experience, Donaldson ran a Saturday-morning workshop for children in [[Portslade]] from 1974 to 1976. During these sessions a simple play would be devised, followed by making of props and costumes, rehearsal and then a performance.

In 1977/6 Donaldson studied at Brighton College of Education for a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] and worked for two years as an English teacher at St Mary's Hall in Brighton until the arrival of their first child Hamish in 1978, after which she never returned to full-time employment. The couple moved to Lyon in France for a year (1979–80) with Hamish, returning to Brighton where their second son Alastair was born in 1981.<ref name=\"Malcolm Donaldson, 2012\"/>

===1980s===

In 1983 the family of four moved to Bristol where Malcolm Donaldson was appointed as Senior Registrar in Paediatrics to United Bristol Hospitals. By then the television writing had dried up and the folk scene had waned. Julia Donaldson wrote and sang a few topical songs for adult radio programmes (including one about the Guinness Distillers take-over bid, which appeared on Financial World Tonight), did occasional amateur acting and street theatre, and wrote the songs for the Kingsdown community play ''Nine Trees Shade''. She also became a volunteer in Hamish's primary school, hearing the children read aloud. She devised short plays with the right number of parts for a reading group, rotating the roles until each child had read the whole play. The piece would then be performed to the entire class. This approach seemed to build confidence in reading aloud as well as being enjoyable, and Donaldson stored the plays in a drawer for possible future use.

In 1989 Malcolm was appointed to Glasgow University as senior lecturer in child health and the family, now five following the arrival of Jesse in 1987, moved to Bearsden.

===1990s===

Once in Glasgow, Donaldson 'pitched' once again for song-writing commissions with the BBC. Between 1990 and 1994 she wrote for various programmes including ''Thinkabout Science'' (two series) and ''Playdays'', composing songs for presenters and puppets (such as Lizzie and the Whybird) to sing.

In 1991 Donaldson was contacted by [[Methuen Publishing]] to ask if the words of her song \"A Squash and a Squeeze\", which she had written for the BBC's ''Playboard'' programme in 1975, could be made into a picture book for children. The book was published in 1993, with illustrations by a German artist [[Axel Scheffler]], who was living in London. Publication of ''A Squash and a Squeeze'' was a pivotal event for Donaldson . It made her realise that her song-writing talent could be applied to story-writing, and gave her the confidence to open her drawer of simple plays for schoolchildren and to send some samples to an educational publisher. Between 1993 and 1999 she wrote extensively for Heinemann and Ginn, including plays such as ''Birthday Surprise'' for younger classes and ''Top of the Mops'' for reluctant teenage readers, as well as re-tellings of traditional tales. During this time Donaldson started visiting Scottish schools and libraries, occasionally accompanied by Malcolm Donaldson and his guitar.<ref name=\"Malcolm Donaldson, 2012\"/>

From the 1990s when Donaldson was extensively visiting school and libraries, she extended techniques learned in Bristol and Brighton to encourage children to act and sing with her. Following the publication of ''The Gruffalo'' she was invited to book festivals, participating in the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]] every year from 1999 onwards, and appearing regularly at Hay, Cheltenham and Bath festivals, as well as at many theatres.

===''The Gruffalo''===
{{Main|The Gruffalo}}
{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}
In 1995, while looking for ideas for an educational series of plays based on traditional tales, Donaldson came across a version of a Chinese story about a little girl who escapes being eaten by a tiger by claiming to be the fearsome Queen of the Jungle and inviting him to walk behind her. The tiger misinterprets the terror of the various animals they meet as being related to her rather than him, and flees. Donaldson sensed that this story could be developed into more than an educational item and returned to it later as a possible basis for a picture book. She decided to make the girl a mouse, and chose a fox, owl and snake as woodland rather than jungle creatures but wasn't satisfied with lines like \"They ought to know, they really should / There aren't any tigers in this wood\".

She then thought of the idea of a monster whose name would end in O (to rhyme with \"doesn't he know\"). \"Gr\" sounded suitably fierce as the start to the monster's name, and filling in the middle with \"uffal\" gave the name Gruffalo, conjuring up the pleasing image of a monster reminiscent of a buffalo but a lot more scary. Even then, ''The Gruffalo'' proved nigh impossible to write but, encouraged by her son Alastair, Donaldson persisted with her idea that the monster, rather than existing in the Deep Dark Wood from the outset, should be a figment of the Mouse's imagination, employed to scare off the fox, owl and snake but then turning out to be a reality. A further objection to the original draft was made by Jesse (by now called Jerry) who asked, \"Mum, why don't the fox, owl and snake just eat the mouse on the spot?\"  This flaw was resolved by inserting the question \"Where are you meeting him? (The Gruffalo)\" and the reply \"Here, by these rocks / And his favourite food is roasted fox\", with similar lines for the remaining two predators.

''The Gruffalo'' was sent to Reid Books in 1995.  Donaldson sent the text to Axel Scheffler, whom she had met only once or twice, briefly, following the publication of ''A Squash and a Squeeze''. Within days Macmillan Children's Books made an offer to publish ''The Gruffalo'', which was illustrated by Scheffler and published in 1999.

===Post-''Gruffalo'' era===

''The Gruffalo'' was an immediate success, going on to win several awards, including the [[Smarties Prize]] (1999). It has subsequently been translated into more than 40 languages, sold over 10 million copies worldwide, and has given rise to stage and screen productions by Tall Stories<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tallstories.org.uk/the-gruffalo|title=The Gruffalo|publisher=Tall Stories theatre company|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref> and Magic Light Pictures. ''The Gruffalo'' was followed by more Donaldson/Scheffler publications by Macmillan: ''[[Monkey Puzzle (book)|Monkey Puzzle]]'' (2000), ''[[Room on the Broom]]'' (2001), ''[[The Smartest Giant in Town]]'' (2002), ''[[The Snail and the Whale]]'' (2003), ''[[The Gruffalo's Child]]'', featuring an only child Gruffalo with a wooden stick doll plus the original cast of Gruffalo, [[Mouse, Fox, Snake and Owl]] (2004), and ''[[Charlie Cook's Favourite Book]]'' (2005). In 2006 Scheffler moved to Alison Green Books who published the duo's ''[[Tiddler (book)|Tiddler]]'' (2007), ''[[Stick Man]]'' (inspired by the Gruffalo's Child's toy) (2008), ''[[Tabby McTat]]'' (2009), ''[[Zog (children's book)|Zog]]'' (2010), ''[[The Highway Rat]]'' (2011), ''[[Superworm (book)|Superworm]]'' (2012) and ''[[The Scarecrows' Wedding]]'' (2014).

Since publication of ''The Gruffalo'', Donaldson has worked with other illustrators including Lydia Monks, David Roberts and Nick Sharratt, who has also illustrated two books of poems by Donaldson, ''Crazy Mayonnaisy Mum''  and ''Wriggle and Roar''. Lydia Monks has illustrated the ''Princess Mirror-Belle'' trilogy, a series of books for 7- to 10-year-olds about a boastful girl who is the mirror reflection of an ordinary girl called Ellen. The inspiration for Mirror-Belle was Hamish's imaginary childhood friend Sammy, who lived behind a wardrobe mirror.

Donaldson is also the author of ''The Giants'' and the ''Joneses'' for children aged 8–12 years. Her teenage novel ''Running on the Cracks'' is set in Glasgow and traces the adventures of orphaned half-Chinese Leo (aged 15) who is fleeing from her dodgy uncle in England and trying to find her father's estranged family. She befriends a schoolboy called Finlay, who is loosely based on Donaldson's youngest son Jerry during his days as a paper boy.  ''Running on the Cracks'', whose element of mental illness is drawn from Hamish's hospital experiences won the [[National Association for Special Educational Needs|Nasen award]] in 2011 for its sympathetic and inclusive portrait of Mary, who befriends Leo but then descends into a severe relapse of her bi-polar condition.

Donaldson has also written a phonic reading scheme of short stories comprising 60 books of ''Songbird Phonics'', published by [[Oxford University Press]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/education/content/primary/series/oxford-reading-tree/songbirds-phonics
|work=[[Oxford University Press]]|title=Songbird Phonics|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref>

A typical public event consists of acting out (more or less word-for-word) four stories, and singing three or four songs (mostly from Donaldson's three albums of songs – ''The Gruffalo Song and Other Songs'', ''Room on the Broom and Other Songs'' and ''The Gruffalo's Child and Other Songs''). There is always a strong element of audience participation, with children (and sometimes their parents) invited on stage to act parts in the stories. Malcolm Donaldson almost always takes part in the events, and they are also often joined by other performers including family members.

Donaldson has also performed jointly with her illustrators, particularly Axel Scheffler and Lydia Monks. She has performed the Donaldson/Scheffler books not only in English but also in German on several tours and at the [[Berlin Festival]]. In 2007, when Malcolm took a sabbatical from his job, he joined Julia on a World Tour, acting and singing in Bermuda, New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea and America.

===Laureateship===

In 2011, Donaldson was appointed [[Children's Laureate]] succeeding the illustrator [[Anthony Browne (author)|Anthony Browne]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/childrens-laureate/former-laureates/julia-donaldson|work=[[BookTrust]]|title=Julia Donaldson Children's Laureate 2013-11|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref> In keeping with her interest in acting and singing Donaldson has set out to encourage children to perform poetry, plays and dramatised readings to generate a love of books and of reading. Accordingly, she has created a series of ''Plays to Read'' for six characters to be performed in the classroom, written by herself and by other writers such as [[Geraldine McCaughrean]], [[Jeanne Willis]], [[Vivian French]], Steve Skidmore and Steve Barlow. The first 36 of these plays, for early readers, were published by Pearson (2013) with a further 24 plays for older primary-school children to following later in the year. She has also compiled an anthology of ''Poems to Perform'' by groups of children (to be published by Macmillan in 2013) and has created an interactive website called picturebookplays.co.uk which gives guidance as to how selected picture books can be turned into classroom plays.

In her laureate role Donaldson has campaigned passionately against library cuts and closures, writing articles, meeting ministers and – with Malcolm Donaldson – embarking on a 6-week tour of UK libraries in autumn 2012. In all of the 38 libraries the visiting children were requested to perform a short play or song based on a picture book, as well as joining in Donaldson's own stories and songs. The tour was designed to celebrate libraries but also to generate publicity about the plight of some of them.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

She is best known for her popular rhyming stories for children, especially those illustrated by [[Axel Scheffler]], which include ''[[The Gruffalo]]'', ''[[Room on the Broom]]'' and ''[[Stick Man]]''. She originally wrote songs for children's television but has concentrated on writing books since the words of one of her songs, \"A Squash and a Squeeze\", were made into a children's book in 1993. Of her 184 published works, 64 are widely available in bookshops. The remaining 120 are intended for school use and include her Songbirds phonic reading scheme, which is part of the Oxford University Press's Oxford Reading Tree.

==Life and career==

=== Childhood ===
Donaldson was born in London and brought up in [[Hampstead]], London, with her younger sister Mary. The family occupied a Victorian three-storey house near [[Hampstead Heath]]. Her parents, sister and their pet cat Geoffrey lived on the ground floor, an aunt and uncle (and later their children, James and Kate) on the first floor and her grandmother on the second floor.

Donaldson's parents, James (always known as Jerry) and Elizabeth, met shortly before the Second World War, which then separated them for six years. Jerry, who had studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at [[Oxford University]], spent most of the war in a prisoner-of-war camp where his knowledge of German earned him the position of an interpreter. Elizabeth, also a good German speaker with a degree in languages, meanwhile did war work in the [[Women's Royal Naval Service|Wrens]].

After the war, they were reunited and married, and in 1950 they bought the Hampstead house together with Jerry's mother, his sister Beta and her husband Chris (the two men had met in the P.O.W. camp). When Donaldson was six her father contracted [[polio]] and thereafter was confined to a wheelchair, though he still led an active life, working as a lecturer in the [[Maudsley Hospital]]'s [[Institute of Psychiatry]], where he pioneered genetic studies using the model of identical twins brought up apart.

Elizabeth worked as a part-time secretary and helped her boss, Leslie Minchin, translate German [[lieder]] into English. It was a household of music and song: Elizabeth sang with the Hampstead Choral Society, Jerry played the cello in amateur string quartets, and both parents were active members of the Hampstead Music Club. Summer holidays were at Grittleton House in Wiltshire, where Jerry played his cello in a summer school for chamber music, while Julia and Mary romped around and put on musical shows with the other children.

Poetry also featured strongly in Donaldson's early life; she was given ''The Book of a Thousand Poems'' by her father when she was five years old, and her grandmother introduced her to [[Edward Lear]]’s nonsense rhymes. Donaldson attended New End Primary School and then [[Camden School for Girls]]. During her childhood and adolescence she acted (understudying the fairies in Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' at The [[Old Vic]] where she made the acquaintance of a young [[Judi Dench]] and [[Tom Courtenay]]), sang with the Children's Opera Group, and learned the piano.

A good linguist, she learned French and German at school and later picked up Italian through a summer tutoring job with a family in Naples, so that by the age of 19 she had a good grasp of all three languages.<ref name=\"Malcolm Donaldson, 2012\">Malcolm Donaldson, 2012</ref>

===University life===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2019}}

Donaldson studied Drama and French at [[Bristol University]] (1967–1970), graduating with a 2:1 honours degree. During her time there she acted in departmental productions and learnt the guitar. In 1968, she and her friend Maureen Purkis took part in the play ''I am not the Eiffel Tower'' with music composed by [[Colin Sell]], an accomplished young pianist who was studying Spanish and Portuguese at Bristol and who has gone on to appear in BBC Radio 4's ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]''. Sell's roommate Malcolm Donaldson, a medical student who played left-handed guitar and was a keen amateur actor, came to see the show and subsequently teamed up with Sell, Donaldson and Purkis to sing in the pubs during Bristol University [[Rag Week]] in early 1969. Almost immediately after this Donaldson and Purkis were seconded to live in Paris for six months as part of their degree course where they sang and played their guitars to café audiences for money. Malcolm joined them in the summer and the trio performed various songs by the [[Beatles]] and from musicals including ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.

After several weeks of busking in Paris, Malcolm followed Julia and Maureen to the Avignon Festival. Here his attempts to sleep on their youth hostel floor led to eviction and the trio moved out, sleeping in a camp site and even a field, by which time a deep friendship had been formed. During their time in Paris the group were spotted by a French entrepreneur who auditioned them. While nothing came of this Donaldson and Purkis penned a tune to the traditional French poem \"Metamorphosis\" specifically for the audition, the first time that Donaldson had composed a song for an occasion (apart from the childhood shows).

By December 1969 Julia and Malcolm had become an item. They began to supply cabaret for the occasional university social event, and in 1970 they visited America, travelling by Greyhound bus from the East to the West coast and busking in Seattle and San Francisco. On their return the duo played in restaurants and began to participate in events as diverse as the [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] Children's Day, an Easter Parade in London and a dental congress dinner – with Julia Donaldson composing songs specially for these occasions.

===1970s===

The couple continued to busk in Europe during holidays, including in France and Italy, with Julia Donaldson writing \"The French Busking Song\" in French, and \"The Spaghetti Song\" in Italian. By 1971, Donaldson was working in London at Michael Joseph publishers as a secretary to Anthea Joseph but was also given considerable leeway as a junior editor. At weekends she and Malcolm took part in the Bristol Street Theatre, a group of mainly postgraduate students inspired by the late playwright David Illingworth. The group devised simple, unscripted plays which could be performed in the playgrounds of poor council estates and which recruited children from the audience to take over some of the roles. This was to have a lasting effect on Donaldson's interaction with children in her own shows as an established children's writer.

The couple were married in September 1972, Donaldson composing an operetta which she and Malcolm, their best man Colin Sell, the bridesmaids and ushers performed at the reception in [[Burgh House]], Hampstead. A picture of the wedding is on display in the house today. Donaldson then worked as a secretary in [[Radio Bristol]] where she also had a weekly slot as short story producer/editor. In August 1974 the couple moved to Brighton where Donaldson had been appointed as editor at Robert Tyndall, a small book publishers. Shortly before this she had sent a tape of songs to BBC Children's Television, and between 1974 and 1978 she wrote regularly for the programme ''[[Play Away]]'', her songs being performed by actors and musicians including [[Toni Arthur]], [[Floella Benjamin]], [[Johnny Ball]], [[Brian Cant]], [[Derek Griffiths]] and musical director [[Jonathan Cohen (musician)|Jonathan Cohen]]. She also wrote occasional songs for ''[[Play School (UK TV series)|Play School]]'' and for the ''[[Watch with Mother]]'' programme ''Play Board''. Some of Donaldson's songs – \"The Luck of the Game\", \"Funny Face\" and \"A Squash and a Squeeze\" – were recorded at this time for BBC albums.

Julia and Malcolm were involved in the Brighton folk club scene, performing floor spots of comedy songs written by Donaldson, often within days of being composed. The songs were variously influenced by [[Flanders and Swann]], topical affairs and traditional folk tales (the latter inspiring spoofs such as \"The Ballad of Jack Nancy and Fred\", and \"Folk Alphabet\"). Their vinyl album ''First Fourteen''(1977) featured many of these songs, while others were included much later on the CD ''Second Fourteen'' (2006, when  ''First Fourteen'' was also re-mastered as a CD).

Donaldson composed two musicals for children: ''King Grunt's Cake'' (1976) and ''Pirate on the Pier'' (1980) which she and a small cast performed both in London and Brighton. Influenced by their Bristol Street Theatre experience, Donaldson ran a Saturday-morning workshop for children in [[Portslade]] from 1974 to 1976. During these sessions a simple play would be devised, followed by making of props and costumes, rehearsal and then a performance.

In 1977/6 Donaldson studied at Brighton College of Education for a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] and worked for two years as an English teacher at St Mary's Hall in Brighton until the arrival of their first child Hamish in 1978, after which she never returned to full-time employment. The couple moved to Lyon in France for a year (1979–80) with Hamish, returning to Brighton where their second son Alastair was born in 1981.<ref name=\"Malcolm Donaldson, 2012\"/>

===1980s===

In 1983 the family of four moved to Bristol where Malcolm Donaldson was appointed as Senior Registrar in Paediatrics to United Bristol Hospitals. By then the television writing had dried up and the folk scene had waned. Julia Donaldson wrote and sang a few topical songs for adult radio programmes (including one about the Guinness Distillers take-over bid, which appeared on Financial World Tonight), did occasional amateur acting and street theatre, and wrote the songs for the Kingsdown community play ''Nine Trees Shade''. She also became a volunteer in Hamish's primary school, hearing the children read aloud. She devised short plays with the right number of parts for a reading group, rotating the roles until each child had read the whole play. The piece would then be performed to the entire class. This approach seemed to build confidence in reading aloud as well as being enjoyable, and Donaldson stored the plays in a drawer for possible future use.

In 1989 Malcolm was appointed to Glasgow University as senior lecturer in child health and the family, now five following the arrival of Jesse in 1987, moved to Bearsden.

===1990s===

Once in Glasgow, Donaldson 'pitched' once again for song-writing commissions with the BBC. Between 1990 and 1994 she wrote for various programmes including ''Thinkabout Science'' (two series) and ''Playdays'', composing songs for presenters and puppets (such as Lizzie and the Whybird) to sing.

In 1991 Donaldson was contacted by [[Methuen Publishing]] to ask if the words of her song \"A Squash and a Squeeze\", which she had written for the BBC's ''Playboard'' programme in 1975, could be made into a picture book for children. The book was published in 1993, with illustrations by a German artist [[Axel Scheffler]], who was living in London. Publication of ''A Squash and a Squeeze'' was a pivotal event for Donaldson . It made her realise that her song-writing talent could be applied to story-writing, and gave her the confidence to open her drawer of simple plays for schoolchildren and to send some samples to an educational publisher. Between 1993 and 1999 she wrote extensively for Heinemann and Ginn, including plays such as ''Birthday Surprise'' for younger classes and ''Top of the Mops'' for reluctant teenage readers, as well as re-tellings of traditional tales. During this time Donaldson started visiting Scottish schools and libraries, occasionally accompanied by Malcolm Donaldson and his guitar.<ref name=\"Malcolm Donaldson, 2012\"/>

From the 1990s when Donaldson was extensively visiting school and libraries, she extended techniques learned in Bristol and Brighton to encourage children to act and sing with her. Following the publication of ''The Gruffalo'' she was invited to book festivals, participating in the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]] every year from 1999 onwards, and appearing regularly at Hay, Cheltenham and Bath festivals, as well as at many theatres.

===''The Gruffalo''===
{{Main|The Gruffalo}}
{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}
In 1995, while looking for ideas for an educational series of plays based on traditional tales, Donaldson came across a version of a Chinese story about a little girl who escapes being eaten by a tiger by claiming to be the fearsome Queen of the Jungle and inviting him to walk behind her. The tiger misinterprets the terror of the various animals they meet as being related to her rather than him, and flees. Donaldson sensed that this story could be developed into more than an educational item and returned to it later as a possible basis for a picture book. She decided to make the girl a mouse, and chose a fox, owl and snake as woodland rather than jungle creatures but wasn't satisfied with lines like \"They ought to know, they really should / There aren't any tigers in this wood\".

She then thought of the idea of a monster whose name would end in O (to rhyme with \"doesn't he know\"). \"Gr\" sounded suitably fierce as the start to the monster's name, and filling in the middle with \"uffal\" gave the name Gruffalo, conjuring up the pleasing image of a monster reminiscent of a buffalo but a lot more scary. Even then, ''The Gruffalo'' proved nigh impossible to write but, encouraged by her son Alastair, Donaldson persisted with her idea that the monster, rather than existing in the Deep Dark Wood from the outset, should be a figment of the Mouse's imagination, employed to scare off the fox, owl and snake but then turning out to be a reality. A further objection to the original draft was made by Jesse (by now called Jerry) who asked, \"Mum, why don't the fox, owl and snake just eat the mouse on the spot?\"  This flaw was resolved by inserting the question \"Where are you meeting him? (The Gruffalo)\" and the reply \"Here, by these rocks / And his favourite food is roasted fox\", with similar lines for the remaining two predators.

''The Gruffalo'' was sent to Reid Books in 1995.  Donaldson sent the text to Axel Scheffler, whom she had met only once or twice, briefly, following the publication of ''A Squash and a Squeeze''. Within days Macmillan Children's Books made an offer to publish ''The Gruffalo'', which was illustrated by Scheffler and published in 1999.

===Post-''Gruffalo'' era===

''The Gruffalo'' was an immediate success, going on to win several awards, including the [[Smarties Prize]] (1999). It has subsequently been translated into more than 40 languages, sold over 10 million copies worldwide, and has given rise to stage and screen productions by Tall Stories<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tallstories.org.uk/the-gruffalo|title=The Gruffalo|publisher=Tall Stories theatre company|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref> and Magic Light Pictures. ''The Gruffalo'' was followed by more Donaldson/Scheffler publications by Macmillan: ''[[Monkey Puzzle (book)|Monkey Puzzle]]'' (2000), ''[[Room on the Broom]]'' (2001), ''[[The Smartest Giant in Town]]'' (2002), ''[[The Snail and the Whale]]'' (2003), ''[[The Gruffalo's Child]]'', featuring an only child Gruffalo with a wooden stick doll plus the original cast of Gruffalo, [[Mouse, Fox, Snake and Owl]] (2004), and ''[[Charlie Cook's Favourite Book]]'' (2005). In 2006 Scheffler moved to Alison Green Books who published the duo's ''[[Tiddler (book)|Tiddler]]'' (2007), ''[[Stick Man]]'' (inspired by the Gruffalo's Child's toy) (2008), ''[[Tabby McTat]]'' (2009), ''[[Zog (children's book)|Zog]]'' (2010), ''[[The Highway Rat]]'' (2011), ''[[Superworm (book)|Superworm]]'' (2012) and ''[[The Scarecrows' Wedding]]'' (2014).

Since publication of ''The Gruffalo'', Donaldson has worked with other illustrators including Lydia Monks, David Roberts and Nick Sharratt, who has also illustrated two books of poems by Donaldson, ''Crazy Mayonnaisy Mum''  and ''Wriggle and Roar''. Lydia Monks has illustrated the ''Princess Mirror-Belle'' trilogy, a series of books for 7- to 10-year-olds about a boastful girl who is the mirror reflection of an ordinary girl called Ellen. The inspiration for Mirror-Belle was Hamish's imaginary childhood friend Sammy, who lived behind a wardrobe mirror.

Donaldson is also the author of ''The Giants'' and the ''Joneses'' for children aged 8–12 years. Her teenage novel ''Running on the Cracks'' is set in Glasgow and traces the adventures of orphaned half-Chinese Leo (aged 15) who is fleeing from her dodgy uncle in England and trying to find her father's estranged family. She befriends a schoolboy called Finlay, who is loosely based on Donaldson's youngest son Jerry during his days as a paper boy.  ''Running on the Cracks'', whose element of mental illness is drawn from Hamish's hospital experiences won the [[National Association for Special Educational Needs|Nasen award]] in 2011 for its sympathetic and inclusive portrait of Mary, who befriends Leo but then descends into a severe relapse of her bi-polar condition.

Donaldson has also written a phonic reading scheme of short stories comprising 60 books of ''Songbird Phonics'', published by [[Oxford University Press]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/education/content/primary/series/oxford-reading-tree/songbirds-phonics
|work=[[Oxford University Press]]|title=Songbird Phonics|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref>

A typical public event consists of acting out (more or less word-for-word) four stories, and singing three or four songs (mostly from Donaldson's three albums of songs – ''The Gruffalo Song and Other Songs'', ''Room on the Broom and Other Songs'' and ''The Gruffalo's Child and Other Songs''). There is always a strong element of audience participation, with children (and sometimes their parents) invited on stage to act parts in the stories. Malcolm Donaldson almost always takes part in the events, and they are also often joined by other performers including family members.

Donaldson has also performed jointly with her illustrators, particularly Axel Scheffler and Lydia Monks. She has performed the Donaldson/Scheffler books not only in English but also in German on several tours and at the [[Berlin Festival]]. In 2007, when Malcolm took a sabbatical from his job, he joined Julia on a World Tour, acting and singing in Bermuda, New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea and America.

===Laureateship===

In 2011, Donaldson was appointed [[Children's Laureate]] succeeding the illustrator [[Anthony Browne (author)|Anthony Browne]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/childrens-laureate/former-laureates/julia-donaldson|work=[[BookTrust]]|title=Julia Donaldson Children's Laureate 2013-11|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref> In keeping with her interest in acting and singing Donaldson has set out to encourage children to perform poetry, plays and dramatised readings to generate a love of books and of reading. Accordingly, she has created a series of ''Plays to Read'' for six characters to be performed in the classroom, written by herself and by other writers such as [[Geraldine McCaughrean]], [[Jeanne Willis]], [[Vivian French]], Steve Skidmore and Steve Barlow. The first 36 of these plays, for early readers, were published by Pearson (2013) with a further 24 plays for older primary-school children to following later in the year. She has also compiled an anthology of ''Poems to Perform'' by groups of children (to be published by Macmillan in 2013) and has created an interactive website called picturebookplays.co.uk which gives guidance as to how selected picture books can be turned into classroom plays.

In her laureate role Donaldson has campaigned passionately against library cuts and closures, writing articles, meeting ministers and – with Malcolm Donaldson – embarking on a 6-week tour of UK libraries in autumn 2012. In all of the 38 libraries the visiting children were requested to perform a short play or song based on a picture book, as well as joining in Donaldson's own stories and songs. The tour was designed to celebrate libraries but also to generate publicity about the plight of some of them.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

{{2019 American Athletic Conference men's soccer standings}}
The '''2019 SMU Mustangs men's soccer team''' represented the [[Southern Methodist University]] during the [[2019 NCAA Division I men's soccer season]] and the [[2019 American Athletic Conference men's soccer season]]. The regular season began on August 30 and concluded on November 5. It was the program's 45th season fielding a men's varsity soccer team, and their 7th season in the AAC.

'''''Eternal Atake''''' is the second studio album by American rapper [[Lil Uzi Vert]]. It is his first project since his 2017 studio album ''[[Luv Is Rage 2]]''. After being initially announced in 2018, the album was released on March 6, 2020, through Generation Now and [[Atlantic Records]] as a surprise release. The album was supported by the singles \"[[Futsal Shuffle 2020]]\" and \"[[That Way (Lil Uzi Vert song)|That Way]]\", which later appeared as the album's bonus tracks. The album features a guest appearance from American singer [[Syd (singer)|Syd]].

''Eternal Atake'' received widespread acclaim and debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], becoming Lil Uzi Vert's second US number-one album. The deluxe version of the album, titled ''[[Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World 2]]'', was released a week later on March 13.

==Background==
In July 2018, Lil Uzi Vert published two messages to Twitter, \"Eternal Atake\" and \"Eternal means forever. Atake means 2 overtake\", that were described as cryptic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/07/lil-uzi-vert-eternal-atake-heavens-gate/|title=Lil Uzi Vert's 'Eternal Atake' Art References Heaven's Gate Cult|website=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|last=Miller|first=Kai|date=July 31, 2018|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> On July 31, 2018, which was also Lil Uzi's 24th birthday, he removed all posts from his Instagram profile except for two—a snippet of \"[[New Patek]]\" and the old cover art of ''Eternal Atake''. On December 9, Lil Uzi confirmed that ''Eternal Atake'' had been finished and was set for release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hypebeast.com/2018/12/lil-uzi-vert-announces-eternal-atake-finished|title=Lil Uzi Vert Confirms 'Eternal Atake' Album Is Complete|website=Hypebeast|last=Chin|first=Mallory|date=December 9, 2018|accessdate=December 11, 2018}}</ref>

''Eternal Atake'' was met with widespread critical acclaim. At [[Metacritic]], the album received an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 85, based on eight reviews.<ref name=\"MC\"/> [[Album of the Year (website)|Album of the Year]] assessed the critical consensus as a 76 out of 100.<ref name=\"AOTY\"/>

Writing for ''[[Consequence of Sound]],'' M. T. Richards gave the album a favorable review, stating that \"''Eternal Atake'' splits the difference between [[P-Funk]] and [[Electronic music|electro]]. In an ironic twist of fate, the year's most futuristic rap album comes courtesy of someone who’d been dismissed as a relic.\" Richards further praises Uzi Vert's performance, saying that \"He sounds alert, refreshed, and sometimes thrilled\", on the album.<ref name=\"CoS\"/> In her review for ''[[NME]]'', Kyann-Sian Williams praised the album, writing, \"Again, he has made another record that will stay close to the hearts of a generation of rap fans. He is surely our generation's Lil Wayne.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/> Writing for ''[[Exclaim!]]'', Kyle Mullin stated positive opinions regarding the album, praising the production as well as the transitions between songs. Mullin mentions that \"Uzi nimbly switches from relatedly lovelorn speak-singing on \"Bust Me\" to rugged, speedy punch line powerhouse on the very next track, \"Prices\". That transition is merely one of the energetic and unpredictable performative tricks Uzi pulls off on this stadium sized LP.\"<ref name=\"exclaim\" /> Scott Glaysher of ''[[HipHopDX]]'' said, \"There is no denying Lil Uzi Vert's unconventional version of rap has been polarizing for the better part of the last five years yet ''Eternal Atake'' should be celebrated. He maneuvers within the cockpit of his comfort zone, navigating a galaxy of different genres while keeping the essence of rap at the forefront.\"<ref name=\"HipHopDX\"/>

Alphonse Pierre of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' gave the album a positive review, saying that \"The expectations were otherworldly. And somehow, Uzi met those expectations. ''Eternal Atake'' is Uzi's greatest album to date, a scope-defying hour-long epic that couldn't be made by anyone else.\"<ref name=\"Pierre\" /> Fred Thomas of [[AllMusic]] saying \"Even though it's a lengthy journey and some of the songs start to feel similar, nothing here is filler.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> Danny Schwartz of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was also positive towards the album, stating that \"It is difficult to remember a rap album released to such fervid expectations, let alone one that lived up to those expectations. ''Eternal Atake'' is Lil Uzi Vert's best album yet, with a cohesiveness, slick concept, and performance that justifies every ounce of hype.\"<ref name=\"RS\" />

'''''Eternal Atake''''' is the second studio album by American rapper [[Lil Uzi Vert]]. It is his first project since his 2017 studio album ''[[Luv Is Rage 2]]''. After being initially announced in 2018, the album was released on March 6, 2020, through Generation Now and [[Atlantic Records]] as a surprise release. The album was supported by the singles \"[[Futsal Shuffle 2020]]\" and \"[[That Way (Lil Uzi Vert song)|That Way]]\", which later appeared as the album's bonus tracks. The album features a guest appearance from American singer [[Syd (singer)|Syd]].

''Eternal Atake'' received widespread acclaim and debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], becoming Lil Uzi Vert's second US number-one album. The deluxe version of the album, titled ''[[Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World 2]]'', was released a week later on March 13.

==Background==
In July 2018, Lil Uzi Vert published two messages to Twitter, \"Eternal Atake\" and \"Eternal means forever. Atake means 2 overtake\", that were described as cryptic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/07/lil-uzi-vert-eternal-atake-heavens-gate/|title=Lil Uzi Vert's 'Eternal Atake' Art References Heaven's Gate Cult|website=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|last=Miller|first=Kai|date=July 31, 2018|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> On July 31, 2018, which was also Lil Uzi's 24th birthday, he removed all posts from his Instagram profile except for two—a snippet of \"[[New Patek]]\" and the old cover art of ''Eternal Atake''. On December 9, Lil Uzi confirmed that ''Eternal Atake'' had been finished and was set for release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hypebeast.com/2018/12/lil-uzi-vert-announces-eternal-atake-finished|title=Lil Uzi Vert Confirms 'Eternal Atake' Album Is Complete|website=Hypebeast|last=Chin|first=Mallory|date=December 9, 2018|accessdate=December 11, 2018}}</ref>

On January 11, 2019, Lil Uzi announced via Instagram that he had \"deleted everything\" and was \"done with music\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/01/11/lil-uzi-vert-says-hes-done-with-music-and-has-deleted-everything|title=Lil Uzi Vert says he's done with music and has \"deleted everything\"|website=[[The Fader]]|last=Maicki|first=Salvatore|date=January 11, 2019|accessdate=March 20, 2019}}</ref> although many believed this could merely have been a publicity stunt and/or a promotional roll-out for the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/lil-uzi-vert-retirement-publicity-stunt-studio/|title=Is Lil Uzi Vert's retirement just a Publicity Stunt?|website=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]|date=January 23, 2019|accessdate=March 20, 2019}}</ref> On March 3, 2020, Lil Uzi revealed a new album cover on Twitter, after allowing fans to vote on the new cover.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2020/03/lil-uzi-vert-three-eternal-atake-album-covers/|title=Lil Uzi Vert Reveals Three Eternal Atake Album Covers|website=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|last=Fitzgerald|first=Trent|date=March 3, 2020|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref>

==Release and promotion==
On November 30, Lil Uzi tweeted that the single he is \"going with\" from ''Eternal Atake'' would be a \"dance record\" titled \"Futsal\";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/lil-uzi-vert-new-eternal-atake-single-tease-the-futsal-shuffle-dance|title=Lil Uzi Vert Teases New Song & Dance|website=Hypebeast|last=Ingvaldsen|first=Torsten|date=November 30, 2019|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref> it was released on December 13, 2019, as \"[[Futsal Shuffle 2020]]\" and the album's first single.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/lil-uzi-vert-shares-new-song-and-dance-futsal-shuffle-listen/|title=Lil Uzi Vert Shares New Song (and Dance) \"Futsal Shuffle 2020\": Listen|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|last=Bloom|first=Madison|date=December 13, 2019|accessdate=March 19, 2020}}</ref> The album's second single \"[[That Way (Lil Uzi Vert song)|That Way]]\", was spontaneously released on March 1, 2020.

''Eternal Atake'' was met with widespread critical acclaim. At [[Metacritic]], the album received an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 85, based on eight reviews.<ref name=\"MC\"/> [[Album of the Year (website)|Album of the Year]] assessed the critical consensus as a 76 out of 100.<ref name=\"AOTY\"/>

Writing for ''[[Consequence of Sound]],'' M. T. Richards gave the album a favorable review, stating that \"''Eternal Atake'' splits the difference between [[P-Funk]] and [[Electronic music|electro]]. In an ironic twist of fate, the year's most futuristic rap album comes courtesy of someone who’d been dismissed as a relic.\" Richards further praises Uzi Vert's performance, saying that \"He sounds alert, refreshed, and sometimes thrilled\", on the album.<ref name=\"CoS\"/> In her review for ''[[NME]]'', Kyann-Sian Williams praised the album, writing, \"Again, he has made another record that will stay close to the hearts of a generation of rap fans. He is surely our generation's Lil Wayne.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/> Writing for ''[[Exclaim!]]'', Kyle Mullin stated positive opinions regarding the album, praising the production as well as the transitions between songs. Mullin mentions that \"Uzi nimbly switches from relatedly lovelorn speak-singing on \"Bust Me\" to rugged, speedy punch line powerhouse on the very next track, \"Prices\". That transition is merely one of the energetic and unpredictable performative tricks Uzi pulls off on this stadium sized LP.\"<ref name=\"exclaim\" /> Scott Glaysher of ''[[HipHopDX]]'' said, \"There is no denying Lil Uzi Vert's unconventional version of rap has been polarizing for the better part of the last five years yet ''Eternal Atake'' should be celebrated. He maneuvers within the cockpit of his comfort zone, navigating a galaxy of different genres while keeping the essence of rap at the forefront.\"<ref name=\"HipHopDX\"/>

Alphonse Pierre of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' gave the album a positive review, saying that \"The expectations were otherworldly. And somehow, Uzi met those expectations. ''Eternal Atake'' is Uzi's greatest album to date, a scope-defying hour-long epic that couldn't be made by anyone else.\"<ref name=\"Pierre\" /> Fred Thomas of [[AllMusic]] saying \"Even though it's a lengthy journey and some of the songs start to feel similar, nothing here is filler.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> Danny Schwartz of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was also positive towards the album, stating that \"It is difficult to remember a rap album released to such fervid expectations, let alone one that lived up to those expectations. ''Eternal Atake'' is Lil Uzi Vert's best album yet, with a cohesiveness, slick concept, and performance that justifies every ounce of hype.\"<ref name=\"RS\" />

'''Madam C. J. Walker''' (born '''Sarah Breedlove'''; December 23, 1867 – May 25, 1919) was an American entrepreneur, philanthropist, and political and social activist.

Walker made her fortune by developing and marketing a line of [[cosmetics]] and [[hair care]] products for [[black women]] through the business she founded, [[Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company]]. She became known also for her philanthropy and activism. She made financial donations to numerous organizations and became a [[patron of the arts]]. [[Villa Lewaro]], Walker's lavish estate in [[Irvington, New York]], served as a social gathering place for the African-American community. At the time of her death, she was considered the wealthiest African-American businesswoman and wealthiest self-made black woman in America.<ref>{{cite triumph|page=75}}</ref> Her name came as a result of her third husband, Charles Joseph Walker, who died in 1926.

==Early life==
Breedlove was born on December 23, 1867, close to [[Delta, Louisiana]], to Owen and Minerva (Anderson) Breedlove.<ref name=BWA1209>Bundles, \"Madam C J (Sarah Breedlove) Walker, 1867–1919\" in ''Black Women in America'', v.

Burney on his Madison Parish plantation. Sarah was the first child in her family born into freedom after the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was signed. Her mother died in 1872, likely from [[cholera]] (an epidemic traveled with river passengers up the Mississippi, reaching Tennessee and related areas in 1873). Her father remarried, but he died a year later.<ref name=\"biography\" />

Orphaned at the age of seven, Sarah moved to [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], at the age of 10, where she lived with her older sister, Louvenia, and brother-in-law, Jesse Powell. Sarah started working as a child as a domestic servant.<ref name=BWA1209/><ref name=indiana-history>{{cite web | title=Madam C. J. Walker | url=https://indianahistory.org/education/educator-resources/famous-hoosiers/madam-c-j-walker/ | publisher=[[Indiana Historical Society]] }}</ref>
“I had little or no opportunity when I started out in life, having been left an orphan and being without mother or father since I was seven years of age,” she often recounted. She also recounted that she had only three months of formal education, which she learned during Sunday school literacy lessons at the church she attended during her earlier years.<ref>Bundles, A. (2001). ''On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C.J. Walker''. New York: Scribner. {{ISBN?}}</ref>

==Marriage and family==
In 1882, at the age of 14, Sarah married Moses McWilliams to escape abuse from her brother-in-law, Jesse Powell.<ref name=BWA1209/> Sarah and Moses had one daughter, [[A'Lelia Walker|A'Lelia]], born on June 6, 1885.

In January 1906, Sarah married Charles Joseph Walker, a newspaper advertising salesman she had known in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Through this marriage, she became known as Madam C. J. Walker.

==Career==
[[File:Madam CJ Walker Manufacturing Company, Indianapolis, Indiana (1911).jpg|thumb|left|C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, 1911.]]
In 1888, Madam CJ Walker and her daughter moved to [[St. Louis]], Missouri, where three of her brothers lived. Sarah found work as a laundress, earning barely more than a dollar a day. She was determined to make enough money to provide her daughter with a formal education.<ref name=bundles /><ref name=biography>{{cite web | url=https://www.biography.com/people/madam-cj-walker-9522174 | title=Madam C. J.

As was common among black women of her era, Sarah suffered severe [[dandruff]] and other scalp ailments, including baldness, due to skin disorders and the application of harsh products to cleanse hair and wash clothes. Other contributing factors to her hair loss included poor diet, illnesses, and infrequent bathing and hair washing during a time when most Americans lacked indoor plumbing, central heating and electricity.<ref name=\"Riquier\" /><ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\">{{cite book | first=A'Lelia |last=Bundles| title=On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C.

Initially, Sarah learned about hair care from her brothers, who were barbers in St. Louis.<ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\"/> Around the time of the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] (World's Fair at St. Louis in 1904), she became a commission agent selling products for [[Annie Malone]], an African-American hair-care entrepreneur, millionaire, and owner of the Poro Company.<ref name=BWA1209/> Sales at the exposition were a disappointment since the African-American community was largely ignored.<ref name=daughter>{{cite news | url=https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/madam-walker/ | title=The Sharecropper's Daughter Who Made Black Women Proud of Their Hair | first=Hunter | last=Oatman-Stanford | work=[[Collectors Weekly]] | date=August 31, 2015}}</ref> While working for Malone, who would later become Walker's largest rival in the hair-care industry,<ref name=\"Philanthropy\" /> Sarah began to take her new knowledge and develop her own product line.<ref name=BWA1210-11/> In July 1905, when she was 37 years old, Sarah and her daughter moved to [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], where she continued to sell products for Malone and develop her own hair-care business. A controversy developed between Annie Malone and Sarah because Malone accused Sarah of stealing her formula, a mixture of [[petroleum jelly]] and [[sulfur]] that had been in use for a hundred years.<ref name=daughter/>

Following her marriage to Charles Walker in 1906, Sarah became known as Madam C. J. Walker. She marketed herself as an independent hairdresser and retailer of cosmetic creams. (\"Madam\" was adopted from women pioneers of the French beauty industry.<ref name=Success />) Her husband, who was also her business partner, provided advice on advertising and promotion; Sarah sold her products door to door, teaching other black women how to groom and style their hair.<ref name=indiana-history/><ref name=BWA1210-11/> In 1906, Walker put her daughter in charge of the mail-order operation in Denver while she and her husband traveled throughout the southern and eastern United States to expand the business.<ref name=\"bundles\">{{cite journal| first=A'Lelia | last=Bundles | title=Madam C.

After Walker closed the business in Denver in 1907, A'lelia ran the day-to-day operations from Pittsburgh. In 1910 Walker established a new base in [[Indianapolis]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Nancy F. |last1=Koehn |author2=Anne E.

She initially purchased a house and factory at 640 North West Street.<ref name=GS361>Gugin and Saint Clair, p. 361.</ref> Walker later built a factory, hair salon, and beauty school to train her sales agents, and added a laboratory to help with research.<ref name=ingham/> She also assembled a staff that included [[Freeman Ransom]], [[Robert Brokenburr|Robert Lee Brokenburr]], Alice Kelly, and [[Marjorie Joyner]], among others, to assist in managing the growing company.<ref name=BWA1210-11/> Many of her company's employees, including those in key management and staff positions, were women.<ref name=Success/>

Walker’s Hair-Care Empire?, The groundbreaking business put her in the history books. Here’s what happened next, BY YOHANA DESTA, MARCH 23, 2020]</ref>]]
To increase her company's sales force, Walker trained other women to become \"beauty culturists\" using \"The Walker System\", her method of grooming that was designed to promote hair growth and to condition the scalp through the use of her products.<ref name=BWA1210-11/> Walker's system included a [[shampoo]], a [[pomade]] stated to help hair grow, strenuous brushing, and applying iron combs to hair. This method claimed to make lackluster and brittle hair become soft and luxurious.<ref name=bundles/><ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\"/> Walker's product line had several competitors. Similar products were produced in Europe and manufactured by other companies in the United States, which included her major rivals, Annie Turnbo Malone's Poro System from which she derived her original formula and later, Sarah Spencer Washington's Apex System.<ref name=Science/>

Between 1911 and 1919, during the height of her career, Walker and her company employed several thousand women as sales agents for its products.<ref name=indiana-history/> By 1917 the company claimed to have trained nearly 20,000 women.<ref name=GS361/> Dressed in a characteristic uniform of white shirts and black skirts and carrying black satchels, they visited houses around the United States and in the [[Caribbean]] offering Walker's hair pomade and other products packaged in tin containers carrying her image. Walker understood the power of advertising and brand awareness. Heavy advertising, primarily in African-American newspapers and magazines, in addition to Walker's frequent travels to promote her products, helped make Walker and her products well known in the United States.

In addition to training in sales and grooming, Walker showed other black women how to budget, build their own businesses, and encouraged them to become financially independent. In 1917, inspired by the model of the [[National Association of Colored Women]], Walker began organizing her sales agents into state and local clubs. The result was the establishment of the National Beauty Culturists and Benevolent Association of Madam C. J. Walker Agents (predecessor to the Madam C. J. Walker Beauty Culturists Union of America).<ref name=\"indiana-history\" /> Its first annual conference convened in [[Philadelphia]] during the summer of 1917 with 200 attendees. The conference is believed to have been among the first national gatherings of women entrepreneurs to discuss business and commerce.<ref name=\"Riquier\" /><ref name=\"bundles\" /> During the convention Walker gave prizes to women who had sold the most products and brought in the most new sales agents. She also rewarded those who made the largest contributions to charities in their communities.<ref name=\"bundles\" />

Walker's name became even more widely known by the 1920s, after her death, as her company's business market expanded beyond the United States to [[Cuba]], [[Jamaica]], [[Haiti]], [[Panama]], and [[Costa Rica]].<ref name=\"bundles\" /><ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\" /><ref name=\"Success\" /><ref name=\"Science\">{{cite web | title=Madame C.

==Activism and philanthropy==
[[File:Madam CJ Walker home 67 Broadway Irvington NY jeh.jpg|thumb|A photograph of Walker's home at 67 Broadway in Irvington, New York.]]
As Walker's wealth and notoriety increased, she became more vocal about her views. In 1912, Walker addressed an annual gathering of the [[National Negro Business League]] (NNBL) from the convention floor, where she declared: \"I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there I was promoted to the washtub. From there, I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there, I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations. I have built my own factory on my own ground.\"<ref name=GS361/> The following year she addressed convention-goers from the podium as a keynote speaker.<ref name=bundles/><ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\"/>

She helped raise funds to establish a branch of [[YMCA]] in Indianapolis's black community, pledging $1,000 to the building fund for Senate Avenue YMCA. Walker also contributed scholarship funds to the [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]]. Other beneficiaries included Indianapolis's Flanner House and [[Bethel A.M.E. Church (Indianapolis, Indiana)|Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church]]; Mary McLeod Bethune's Daytona Education and Industrial School for Negro Girls (which later became [[Bethune-Cookman University]]) in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]; the [[Palmer Memorial Institute]] in [[North Carolina]]; and the Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Walker was also a [[patron of the arts]].<ref name=indiana-history/><ref name=bundles/>

About 1913, Walker's daughter, A'Lelia, moved to a new townhouse in [[Harlem]], and in 1916, Walker joined her in New York, leaving the day-to-day operation of her company to her management team in Indianapolis.<ref name=Bundles-website/><ref name=GS361/> In 1917, Walker commissioned [[Vertner Tandy]], the first licensed black architect in New York City and a founding member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity, to design her house in [[Irvington-on-Hudson, New York|Irvington-on-Hudson]], New York. Walker intended for [[Villa Lewaro]], which cost $250,000 to build, to become a gathering place for community leaders and to inspire other African Americans to pursue their dreams.<ref name=Science/><ref>Bundles, \"Madam C J (Sarah Breedlove) Walker, 1867–1919\" in ''Black Women in America'', v.

Walker became more involved in political matters after her move to New York. She delivered lectures on political, economic, and social issues at conventions sponsored by powerful black institutions. Her friends and associates included [[Booker T. Washington]], [[Mary McLeod Bethune]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].<ref name=indiana-history/> During [[World War I]] Walker was a leader in the Circle For Negro War Relief and advocated for the establishment of a training camp for black army officers.<ref name=GS361/> In 1917 she joined the executive committee of New York chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), which organized the [[Silent Parade|Silent Protest Parade]] on New York City's [[Fifth Avenue]]. The public demonstration drew more than 8,000 African Americans to protest a riot in East Saint Louis that killed 39 African-Americans.<ref name=bundles/>

Profits from her business significantly impacted Walker's contributions to her political and philanthropic interests. In 1918 the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs]] (NACWC) honored Walker for making the largest individual contribution to help preserve [[Frederick Douglass]]'s [[Anacostia]] house.<ref>Bundles, \"Madam C J (Sarah Breedlove) Walker, 1867–1919\" in ''Black Women in America'', v. II, p. 1212.</ref> Before her death in 1919, Walker pledged $5,000 (the equivalent of about $77,700 in 2019) to the NAACP's anti-[[lynching]] fund. At the time it was the largest gift from an individual that the NAACP had ever received. Walker bequeathed nearly $100,000 to orphanages, institutions, and individuals; her will directed two-thirds of future net profits of her estate to charity.<ref name=Philanthropy>{{cite web | title=Madam C.

==Death and legacy==
Walker died on May 25, 1919, from [[kidney failure]] and complications of [[hypertension]], at the age of 51.<ref name=indiana-history/><ref name=GS361/><ref name=TimesObit/> Walker's remains are interred in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[the Bronx]], New York City.<ref>{{cite web | title =Woodlawn Cemetery–Madam Walker's Burial Place–Named National Historic Landmark |url=https://madamcjwalker.wordpress.com/tag/woodlawn-cemetery/|publisher=Madam C. J. Walker website}}</ref>

At the time of her death, Walker was considered to be the wealthiest African-American woman in America. According to Walker's obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'', \"she said herself two years ago [in 1917] that she was not yet a millionaire, but hoped to be some time, not that she wanted the money for herself, but for the good she could do with it.\"<ref name=TimesObit/> The obituary also noted  that the same year, her $250,000 mansion was completed at the banks of the Hudson at Irvington.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1291389/cj-walker-obit/|title=CJ Walker Obit.|date=1919-05-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-22|pages=15}}</ref> Her daughter, [[A'Lelia Walker]], became the president of the [[Madam C.

Walker's personal papers are preserved at the [[Indiana Historical Society]] in Indianapolis.<ref name=Riquier/> Her legacy also continues through two properties listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]: Villa Lewaro in [[Irvington, New York|Irvington]], New York, and the [[Madame Walker Theatre Center]] in Indianapolis. Villa Lewaro was sold following A'Lelia Walker's death to a fraternal organization called the Companions of the Forest in America in 1932. The house was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979. The [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] has designated the privately owned property a National Treasure.<ref>{{cite web| first=Jessica | last=Pumphrey | title =Sign the Pledge to Protect Villa Lewaro – And Learn How You Can Tour It | website = | publisher =National Trust for Historic Preservation  | url = https://savingplaces.org/stories/pledge-protect-villa-lewaro-get-tour#.VrT4TWBEg2w | date =October 24, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |

On March 4, 2016, Sundial Brands, a skincare and haircare company, launched a collaboration with [[Sephora]] in honor of Walker's legacy. The launch, titled \"Madam C. J.

===TV series===
In 2020, actress [[Octavia Spencer]] committed to portray Walker in a TV series based on the biography of Walker by [[A'Lelia Bundles]], Walker's great-great-granddaughter. The series is called ''[[Self Made (TV series)|Self Made: Inspired by the life of Madam C. J.

The portrayal of [[Annie Malone]] as Addie Monroe, another black female self made millionaire as a villain and the daughter of Walker as a lesbian were some of the complaints by audiences.  <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harlemworldmagazine.com/the-problem-with-the-facts-about-madam-c-j-walker-and-annie-malone-and-the-netflix-series/|title=The Problem With \"The Facts About Madam C.J.

'''Madam C. J. Walker''' (born '''Sarah Breedlove'''; December 23, 1867 – May 25, 1919) was an American entrepreneur, philanthropist, and political and social activist.

At the time of her death, she was considered the wealthiest African-American businesswoman and wealthiest self-made black woman in America.<ref>{{cite triumph|page=75}}</ref> Her name came as a result of her third husband, Charles Joseph Walker, who died in 1926.

Burney on his Madison Parish plantation. Sarah was the first child in her family born into freedom after the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was signed. Her mother died in 1872, likely from [[cholera]] (an epidemic traveled with river passengers up the Mississippi, reaching Tennessee and related areas in 1873). Her father remarried, but he died a year later.<ref name=\"biography\" />

Orphaned at the age of seven, Sarah moved to [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], at the age of 10, where she lived with her older sister, Louvenia, and brother-in-law, Jesse Powell.

“I had little or no opportunity when I started out in life, having been left an orphan and being without mother or father since I was seven years of age,” she often recounted. She also recounted that she had only three months of formal education, which she learned during Sunday school literacy lessons at the church she attended during her earlier years.<ref>Bundles, A.

In 1888, Madam CJ Walker and her daughter moved to [[St. Louis]], Missouri, where three of her brothers lived. Sarah found work as a laundress, earning barely more than a dollar a day. She was determined to make enough money to provide her daughter with a formal education.<ref name=bundles /><ref name=biography>{{cite web | url=https://www.biography.com/people/madam-cj-walker-9522174 | title=Madam C.

As was common among black women of her era, Sarah suffered severe [[dandruff]] and other scalp ailments, including baldness, due to skin disorders and the application of harsh products to cleanse hair and wash clothes. Other contributing factors to her hair loss included poor diet, illnesses, and infrequent bathing and hair washing during a time when most Americans lacked indoor plumbing, central heating and electricity.<ref name=\"Riquier\" /><ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\">{{cite book | first=A'Lelia |last=Bundles| title=On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C.

Initially, Sarah learned about hair care from her brothers, who were barbers in St. Louis.<ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\"/> Around the time of the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] (World's Fair at St. Louis in 1904), she became a commission agent selling products for [[Annie Malone]], an African-American hair-care entrepreneur, millionaire, and owner of the Poro Company.<ref name=BWA1209/> Sales at the exposition were a disappointment since the African-American community was largely ignored.<ref name=daughter>{{cite news | url=https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/madam-walker/ | title=The Sharecropper's Daughter Who Made Black Women Proud of Their Hair | first=Hunter | last=Oatman-Stanford | work=[[Collectors Weekly]] | date=August 31, 2015}}</ref> While working for Malone, who would later become Walker's largest rival in the hair-care industry,<ref name=\"Philanthropy\" /> Sarah began to take her new knowledge and develop her own product line.<ref name=BWA1210-11/> In July 1905, when she was 37 years old, Sarah and her daughter moved to [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], where she continued to sell products for Malone and develop her own hair-care business. A controversy developed between Annie Malone and Sarah because Malone accused Sarah of stealing her formula, a mixture of [[petroleum jelly]] and [[sulfur]] that had been in use for a hundred years.<ref name=daughter/>

Following her marriage to Charles Walker in 1906, Sarah became known as Madam C. J. Walker. She marketed herself as an independent hairdresser and retailer of cosmetic creams. (\"Madam\" was adopted from women pioneers of the French beauty industry.<ref name=Success />) Her husband, who was also her business partner, provided advice on advertising and promotion; Sarah sold her products door to door, teaching other black women how to groom and style their hair.<ref name=indiana-history/><ref name=BWA1210-11/> In 1906, Walker put her daughter in charge of the mail-order operation in Denver while she and her husband traveled throughout the southern and eastern United States to expand the business.<ref name=\"bundles\">{{cite journal| first=A'Lelia | last=Bundles | title=Madam C.

After Walker closed the business in Denver in 1907, A'lelia ran the day-to-day operations from Pittsburgh. In 1910 Walker established a new base in [[Indianapolis]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Nancy F. |last1=Koehn |author2=Anne E.

In 1910, Walker relocated her businesses to [[Indianapolis]], where she established the headquarters for the Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company. She initially purchased a house and factory at 640 North West Street.<ref name=GS361>Gugin and Saint Clair, p. 361.</ref> Walker later built a factory, hair salon, and beauty school to train her sales agents, and added a laboratory to help with research.<ref name=ingham/> She also assembled a staff that included [[Freeman Ransom]], [[Robert Brokenburr|Robert Lee Brokenburr]], Alice Kelly, and [[Marjorie Joyner]], among others, to assist in managing the growing company.<ref name=BWA1210-11/> Many of her company's employees, including those in key management and staff positions, were women.<ref name=Success/>

Walker’s Hair-Care Empire?, The groundbreaking business put her in the history books. Here’s what happened next, BY YOHANA DESTA, MARCH 23, 2020]</ref>]]
To increase her company's sales force, Walker trained other women to become \"beauty culturists\" using \"The Walker System\", her method of grooming that was designed to promote hair growth and to condition the scalp through the use of her products.<ref name=BWA1210-11/> Walker's system included a [[shampoo]], a [[pomade]] stated to help hair grow, strenuous brushing, and applying iron combs to hair. This method claimed to make lackluster and brittle hair become soft and luxurious.<ref name=bundles/><ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\"/> Walker's product line had several competitors. Similar products were produced in Europe and manufactured by other companies in the United States, which included her major rivals, Annie Turnbo Malone's Poro System from which she derived her original formula and later, Sarah Spencer Washington's Apex System.<ref name=Science/>

Between 1911 and 1919, during the height of her career, Walker and her company employed several thousand women as sales agents for its products.<ref name=indiana-history/> By 1917 the company claimed to have trained nearly 20,000 women.<ref name=GS361/> Dressed in a characteristic uniform of white shirts and black skirts and carrying black satchels, they visited houses around the United States and in the [[Caribbean]] offering Walker's hair pomade and other products packaged in tin containers carrying her image. Walker understood the power of advertising and brand awareness. Heavy advertising, primarily in African-American newspapers and magazines, in addition to Walker's frequent travels to promote her products, helped make Walker and her products well known in the United States.

In addition to training in sales and grooming, Walker showed other black women how to budget, build their own businesses, and encouraged them to become financially independent. In 1917, inspired by the model of the [[National Association of Colored Women]], Walker began organizing her sales agents into state and local clubs. The result was the establishment of the National Beauty Culturists and Benevolent Association of Madam C. J. Walker Agents (predecessor to the Madam C. J. Walker Beauty Culturists Union of America).<ref name=\"indiana-history\" /> Its first annual conference convened in [[Philadelphia]] during the summer of 1917 with 200 attendees. The conference is believed to have been among the first national gatherings of women entrepreneurs to discuss business and commerce.<ref name=\"Riquier\" /><ref name=\"bundles\" /> During the convention Walker gave prizes to women who had sold the most products and brought in the most new sales agents. She also rewarded those who made the largest contributions to charities in their communities.<ref name=\"bundles\" />

Walker's name became even more widely known by the 1920s, after her death, as her company's business market expanded beyond the United States to [[Cuba]], [[Jamaica]], [[Haiti]], [[Panama]], and [[Costa Rica]].<ref name=\"bundles\" /><ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\" /><ref name=\"Success\" /><ref name=\"Science\">{{cite web | title=Madame C.

==Activism and philanthropy==
[[File:Madam CJ Walker home 67 Broadway Irvington NY jeh.jpg|thumb|A photograph of Walker's home at 67 Broadway in Irvington, New York.]]
As Walker's wealth and notoriety increased, she became more vocal about her views. In 1912, Walker addressed an annual gathering of the [[National Negro Business League]] (NNBL) from the convention floor, where she declared: \"I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there I was promoted to the washtub. From there, I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there, I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations. I have built my own factory on my own ground.\"<ref name=GS361/> The following year she addressed convention-goers from the podium as a keynote speaker.<ref name=bundles/><ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\"/>

She helped raise funds to establish a branch of [[YMCA]] in Indianapolis's black community, pledging $1,000 to the building fund for Senate Avenue YMCA. Walker also contributed scholarship funds to the [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]]. Other beneficiaries included Indianapolis's Flanner House and [[Bethel A.M.E. Church (Indianapolis, Indiana)|Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church]]; Mary McLeod Bethune's Daytona Education and Industrial School for Negro Girls (which later became [[Bethune-Cookman University]]) in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]; the [[Palmer Memorial Institute]] in [[North Carolina]]; and the Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Walker was also a [[patron of the arts]].<ref name=indiana-history/><ref name=bundles/>

About 1913, Walker's daughter, A'Lelia, moved to a new townhouse in [[Harlem]], and in 1916, Walker joined her in New York, leaving the day-to-day operation of her company to her management team in Indianapolis.<ref name=Bundles-website/><ref name=GS361/> In 1917, Walker commissioned [[Vertner Tandy]], the first licensed black architect in New York City and a founding member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity, to design her house in [[Irvington-on-Hudson, New York|Irvington-on-Hudson]], New York. Walker intended for [[Villa Lewaro]], which cost $250,000 to build, to become a gathering place for community leaders and to inspire other African Americans to pursue their dreams.<ref name=Science/><ref>Bundles, \"Madam C J (Sarah Breedlove) Walker, 1867–1919\" in ''Black Women in America'', v.

Walker became more involved in political matters after her move to New York. She delivered lectures on political, economic, and social issues at conventions sponsored by powerful black institutions. Her friends and associates included [[Booker T. Washington]], [[Mary McLeod Bethune]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].<ref name=indiana-history/> During [[World War I]] Walker was a leader in the Circle For Negro War Relief and advocated for the establishment of a training camp for black army officers.<ref name=GS361/> In 1917 she joined the executive committee of New York chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), which organized the [[Silent Parade|Silent Protest Parade]] on New York City's [[Fifth Avenue]]. The public demonstration drew more than 8,000 African Americans to protest a riot in East Saint Louis that killed 39 African-Americans.<ref name=bundles/>

Profits from her business significantly impacted Walker's contributions to her political and philanthropic interests. In 1918 the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs]] (NACWC) honored Walker for making the largest individual contribution to help preserve [[Frederick Douglass]]'s [[Anacostia]] house.<ref>Bundles, \"Madam C J (Sarah Breedlove) Walker, 1867–1919\" in ''Black Women in America'', v.

At the time it was the largest gift from an individual that the NAACP had ever received. Walker bequeathed nearly $100,000 to orphanages, institutions, and individuals; her will directed two-thirds of future net profits of her estate to charity.<ref name=Philanthropy>{{cite web | title=Madam C.

At the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, Soviet nuclear weapons were deployed in four of the new republics: Russia, [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. In May 1992, these four states signed the [[Lisbon Protocol]], agreeing to join the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]], with Russia the [[successor state]] to the Soviet Union as a nuclear state, and the other three states joining as non-nuclear states.

Ukraine agreed to give up its weapons to Russia, in exchange for guarantees of Ukrainian territory from Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, known as the [[Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances]]. China and France also made statements in support of the memorandum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/the-budapest-memorandum-and-crimea/1862439.html|title=The Budapest Memorandum and Crimea|work=VOA|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}</ref>

===Nuclear arsenal of Russia===
The exact number of nuclear warheads is a state secret and is therefore a matter of guesswork. The [[Federation of American Scientists]] estimates that Russia possesses 6,500 nuclear weapons, while the United States has 6,185; Russia and the U.S. each have 1,600 active deployed strategic nuclear warheads.<ref name=FAS/><ref>{{cite journal|title=Russian nuclear forces, 2016|journal = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|first1=Hans M.|last1=Kristensen|first2=Robert S.|last2=Norris|volume=72|issue=3|pages=125–134|doi=10.1080/00963402.2016.1170359|year = 2016}}</ref>

During an annual state-of-the-nation address given on March 1, 2018, President [[Vladimir Putin]] publicly claimed that Russia was now in possession of several new classes of nuclear weapons, including some with capabilities previously speculated to exist. Putin discussed several new or upgraded weapons, including a [[Boost-glide|hypersonic glide vehicle]] known as the [[Avangard (hypersonic glide vehicle)|Avangard]] capable of performing sharp maneuvers while traveling at 20 times the speed of sound making it \"absolutely invulnerable for any missile defense system.\" <ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/putin-boasts-russian-nuclear-weapons-53433951]{{dead link|date=June 2019}}</ref> Putin also discussed the existence of a nuclear powered underwater torpedo and a nuclear powered [[cruise missile]] ([[9M730 Burevestnik]]), both with effectively unlimited range. He also discussed that Russia had tested a new class of traditional ICBM called the Sarmat, which expanded upon the range and carrying capability of the Soviet-era Satan ICBM. Animations of these weapons were shown in front of the live and televised audience, and Putin suggested that an online poll be conducted to give them official public names.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43239331|title=Russia has 'invincible' nuclear weapons|date=March 1, 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref>
===Nuclear weapons in Russian military doctrine===
{{Main|Military doctrine of Russia}}
According to a Russian military doctrine stated in 2010, nuclear weapons could be used by Russia \"in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies, and also in case of aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened\".<ref name=\"rus_mil_doc\">[http://www.kremlin.ru/ref_notes/461 Russian military doctrine] (in Russian)</ref> Most military analysts believe that, in this case, Russia would pursue an 'escalate to de-escalate’ strategy, initiating limited nuclear exchange to bring adversaries to the negotiating table. Russia will also threaten nuclear conflict to discourage initial escalation of any major conventional conflict.<ref>{{cite news | last=Blank | first=Stephen | date=25 February 2018 | title=Getting Russia's nuclear strategy mostly right | url=https://thehill.com/opinion/international/375340-getting-russias-nuclear-strategy-mostly-right | work=The Hill | location=USA | access-date=26 October 2018 }}</ref>

===Nuclear proliferation===
[[File:World nuclear weapons.png|thumb|right|270px|Large stockpile with global range (dark blue)]]
After the [[Korean War]], the [[Soviet Union]] transferred nuclear technology and weapons to the [[People's Republic of China]] as an adversary of the United States and [[NATO]]. According to [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], \"Khrushchev's nuclear-proliferation process started with Communist China in April 1955, when the new ruler in the Kremlin consented to supply Beijing a sample atomic bomb and to help with its mass production. Subsequently, the Soviet Union built all the essentials of China's new military nuclear industry.\"<ref name=\"bomb\">[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YmU3NjM4ZTg3NjViMTUyNWJmYWYzMDE4ZmRhOTQxZmI= Tyrants and the Bomb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606154259/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YmU3NjM4ZTg3NjViMTUyNWJmYWYzMDE4ZmRhOTQxZmI= |date=June 6, 2009 }} - by [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], ''[[National Review]]'', October 17, 2006</ref>

Russia is one of the five \"Nuclear Weapons States\" (NWS) under the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (NPT), which Russia ratified (as the [[Soviet Union]]) in 1968.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, a number of Soviet-era nuclear warheads remained on the territories of Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Under the terms of the [[Lisbon Protocol]] to the NPT, and following the 1995 Trilateral Agreement between Russia, Belarus, and the USA, these were transferred to Russia, leaving Russia as the sole inheritor of the Soviet nuclear arsenal. It is estimated that the Soviet Union had approximately 45,000 nuclear weapons stockpiled at the time of its collapse.

The collapse of the Soviet Union allowed for a warming of relations with NATO. Fears of a [[nuclear holocaust]] lessened. In September 1997, the former secretary of the Russian Security Council Alexander Lebed claimed 100 \"suitcase sized\" nuclear weapons were unaccounted for. He said he was attempting to inventory the weapons when he was fired by President Boris Yeltsin in October 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/act/1997_09/lebedsept|title=Russian Officials Deny Claims Of Missing Nuclear Weapons|publisher=|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}</ref> Indeed, several US politicians have expressed worries and promised legislation addressing the threat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/1010/nuclear_dangers.html?breadcrumb=%2F|title=Nuclear Dangers: Fear Increases of Terrorists Getting Hands on 'Loose' Warheads as Security Slips|date=October 19, 1997|publisher=|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}</ref>

In 2002, the United States and Russia agreed to reduce their stockpiles to not more than 2,700 warheads each in the [[SORT]] treaty. In 2003, the US rejected Russian proposals to further reduce each nation's nuclear stockpiles to 1,500. Russia, in turn, refused to discuss reduction of [[tactical nuclear weapons]].<ref name=\"trenin\">[http://ifri.org/files/Securite_defense/prolif_paper_Trenin.pdf Russia's Nuclear Policy in the 21st Century Environment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227231134/http://ifri.org/files/Securite_defense/prolif_paper_Trenin.pdf |date=February 27, 2008 }} - analysis by Dmitri Trenin, IFRI Proliferation Papers n°13, 2005</ref>

===Nuclear sabotage allegations from Russia===
The highest-ranking [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] defector [[Stanislav Lunev]] described alleged Soviet plans for using [[tactical nuclear weapons]] for [[sabotage]] against the United States in the event of war. He described Soviet-made [[suitcase nukes]] identified as RA-115s (or RA-115-01s for submersible weapons) which weigh from fifty to sixty pounds (23&nbsp;kg - 27&nbsp;kg). These portable bombs can last for many years if wired to an electric source. \"In case there is a loss of power, there is a battery backup. If the battery runs low, the weapon has a transmitter that sends a coded message – either by satellite or directly to a GRU post at a Russian embassy or consulate.\".<ref name=\"Lunev\">[[Stanislav Lunev]]. ''Through the Eyes of the Enemy: The Autobiography of Stanislav Lunev'', Regnery Publishing, Inc., 1998. {{ISBN|0-89526-390-4}}.</ref>

Lunev was personally looking for hiding places for weapons caches in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] area.<ref name=\"Lunev\"/> He said that \"it is surprisingly easy to smuggle nuclear weapons into the US\" either across the Mexican border or using a small transport missile that can slip though undetected when launched from a Russian airplane.<ref name=\"Lunev\"/> Searches of the areas identified by Lunev – who admits he never planted any weapons in the US – have been conducted, \"but law-enforcement officials have never found such weapons caches, with or without portable nuclear weapons\" in the US.<ref>Steve Goldstein and Chris Mondics, \"Some Weldon-backed allegations unconfirmed; Among them: A plot to crash planes into a reactor, and missing suitcase-size Soviet atomic weapons.\" ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' (15 March 2006) A7.</ref>

In a 2004 interview, colonel general of [[Strategic Missile Forces|RVSN]] [[Viktor Esin]] said that Soviet small-scale nuclear bombs have only been operated by the Army. All such devices have been stored in a weapons depot within Russia, and only left it for checks at the plant which produced them.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Novikova |first1=Inna |title=Куда исчезли \"ядерные чемоданчики\"? |url=https://military.pravda.ru/46851-sadm/ |work=[[Pravda]] |date=March 29, 2004 |language=Russian}}</ref>

==Biological weapons==
{{Main|Soviet biological weapons program}}

Soviet program of [[biological weapon]]s was initially developed by the
[[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union]] (between 1945 and 1973).<ref name=\"Alibek\">Alibek, K. and S. Handelman. Biohazard: The Chilling True Story of the Largest Covert Biological Weapons Program in the World– Told from Inside by the Man Who Ran it. Delta (2000) {{ISBN|0-385-33496-6}}</ref>

The Soviet Union signed the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] on April 10, 1972 and ratified the treaty on March 26, 1975. However, it subsequently augmented its biowarfare programs. After 1975, the program of biological weapons was run primarily by the \"civilian\" [[Biopreparat]] agency, although it also included numerous facilities run by the  Soviet Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Chemical Industry, Ministry of Health, and [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=\"Alibek\"/>

According to [[Ken Alibek]], who was deputy-director of [[Biopreparat]], the Soviet biological weapons agency, and who defected to the United States in 1992, weapons were developed in labs in isolated areas of the Soviet Union including mobilization facilities at [[Omutininsk]], [[Penza]] and [[Pokrov, Vladimir Oblast|Pokrov]] and research facilities at [[Moscow]], [[Stirzhi]] and [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. These weapons were tested at several facilities most often at \"Rebirth Island\" ([[Vozrozhdeniya]]) in the [[Aral Sea]] by firing the weapons into the air above monkeys tied to posts, the monkeys would then be monitored to determine the effects. According to Alibek, although Soviet offensive program was officially ended in 1992, Russia may be still involved in the activities prohibited by BWC.<ref name=\"Alibek\"/>

In 1993, the story about the [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak]] was published in Russia. The incident occurred when [[spore]]s of [[anthrax]] were accidentally released from a military facility in the city of Sverdlovsk (formerly, and now again, [[Yekaterinburg]]) {{convert|1500|km|abbr=on}} east of Moscow on April 2, 1979. The ensuing outbreak of the disease resulted in 94 people becoming infected, 64 of whom died over a period of six weeks.<ref name=\"Alibek\"/>

==Chemical weapons==
Russia signed the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] on January 13, 1993, and ratified it on November 5, 1997. Russia declared an arsenal of 39,967 tons of [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapons]] in 1997 consisting of:
*[[blister agent]]s: [[Lewisite]], [[mustard gas|mustard]], Lewisite-mustard-mix (HL)
*[[nerve agent]]s: [[Sarin]], [[Soman]], [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]]

Ratification was followed by three years of inaction on chemical weapons destruction because of the [[August 1998 Russian financial crisis]].

Russia met its treaty obligations by destroying 1% of its chemical agents by the Chemical Weapons Convention's 2002 deadline,<ref>[http://www.opcw.org/html/global/ra_frameset.html News<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040406043031/http://www.opcw.org/html/global/ra_frameset.html |date=April 6, 2004 }}</ref> but requested technical and financial assistance and extensions on the deadlines of 2004 and 2007 due to the environmental challenges of chemical disposal.

===History===

====Soviet era====
{{main|Soviet atomic bomb project}}

====Post-Soviet era====
At the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, Soviet nuclear weapons were deployed in four of the new republics: Russia, [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. In May 1992, these four states signed the [[Lisbon Protocol]], agreeing to join the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]], with Russia the [[successor state]] to the Soviet Union as a nuclear state, and the other three states joining as non-nuclear states.

Ukraine agreed to give up its weapons to Russia, in exchange for guarantees of Ukrainian territory from Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, known as the [[Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances]]. China and France also made statements in support of the memorandum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/the-budapest-memorandum-and-crimea/1862439.html|title=The Budapest Memorandum and Crimea|work=VOA|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}</ref>

===Nuclear arsenal of Russia===
The exact number of nuclear warheads is a state secret and is therefore a matter of guesswork. The [[Federation of American Scientists]] estimates that Russia possesses 6,500 nuclear weapons, while the United States has 6,185; Russia and the U.S. each have 1,600 active deployed strategic nuclear warheads.<ref name=FAS/><ref>{{cite journal|title=Russian nuclear forces, 2016|journal = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|first1=Hans M.|last1=Kristensen|first2=Robert S.|last2=Norris|volume=72|issue=3|pages=125–134|doi=10.1080/00963402.2016.1170359|year = 2016}}</ref>

During an annual state-of-the-nation address given on March 1, 2018, President [[Vladimir Putin]] publicly claimed that Russia was now in possession of several new classes of nuclear weapons, including some with capabilities previously speculated to exist. Putin discussed several new or upgraded weapons, including a [[Boost-glide|hypersonic glide vehicle]] known as the [[Avangard (hypersonic glide vehicle)|Avangard]] capable of performing sharp maneuvers while traveling at 20 times the speed of sound making it \"absolutely invulnerable for any missile defense system.\" <ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/putin-boasts-russian-nuclear-weapons-53433951]{{dead link|date=June 2019}}</ref> Putin also discussed the existence of a nuclear powered underwater torpedo and a nuclear powered [[cruise missile]] ([[9M730 Burevestnik]]), both with effectively unlimited range. He also discussed that Russia had tested a new class of traditional ICBM called the Sarmat, which expanded upon the range and carrying capability of the Soviet-era Satan ICBM. Animations of these weapons were shown in front of the live and televised audience, and Putin suggested that an online poll be conducted to give them official public names.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43239331|title=Russia has 'invincible' nuclear weapons|date=March 1, 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref>
===Nuclear weapons in Russian military doctrine===
{{Main|Military doctrine of Russia}}
According to a Russian military doctrine stated in 2010, nuclear weapons could be used by Russia \"in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies, and also in case of aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened\".<ref name=\"rus_mil_doc\">[http://www.kremlin.ru/ref_notes/461 Russian military doctrine] (in Russian)</ref> Most military analysts believe that, in this case, Russia would pursue an 'escalate to de-escalate’ strategy, initiating limited nuclear exchange to bring adversaries to the negotiating table. Russia will also threaten nuclear conflict to discourage initial escalation of any major conventional conflict.<ref>{{cite news | last=Blank | first=Stephen | date=25 February 2018 | title=Getting Russia's nuclear strategy mostly right | url=https://thehill.com/opinion/international/375340-getting-russias-nuclear-strategy-mostly-right | work=The Hill | location=USA | access-date=26 October 2018 }}</ref>

===Nuclear proliferation===
[[File:World nuclear weapons.png|thumb|right|270px|Large stockpile with global range (dark blue)]]
After the [[Korean War]], the [[Soviet Union]] transferred nuclear technology and weapons to the [[People's Republic of China]] as an adversary of the United States and [[NATO]]. According to [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], \"Khrushchev's nuclear-proliferation process started with Communist China in April 1955, when the new ruler in the Kremlin consented to supply Beijing a sample atomic bomb and to help with its mass production. Subsequently, the Soviet Union built all the essentials of China's new military nuclear industry.\"<ref name=\"bomb\">[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YmU3NjM4ZTg3NjViMTUyNWJmYWYzMDE4ZmRhOTQxZmI= Tyrants and the Bomb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606154259/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YmU3NjM4ZTg3NjViMTUyNWJmYWYzMDE4ZmRhOTQxZmI= |date=June 6, 2009 }} - by [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], ''[[National Review]]'', October 17, 2006</ref>

Russia is one of the five \"Nuclear Weapons States\" (NWS) under the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (NPT), which Russia ratified (as the [[Soviet Union]]) in 1968.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, a number of Soviet-era nuclear warheads remained on the territories of Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Under the terms of the [[Lisbon Protocol]] to the NPT, and following the 1995 Trilateral Agreement between Russia, Belarus, and the USA, these were transferred to Russia, leaving Russia as the sole inheritor of the Soviet nuclear arsenal. It is estimated that the Soviet Union had approximately 45,000 nuclear weapons stockpiled at the time of its collapse.

The collapse of the Soviet Union allowed for a warming of relations with NATO. Fears of a [[nuclear holocaust]] lessened. In September 1997, the former secretary of the Russian Security Council Alexander Lebed claimed 100 \"suitcase sized\" nuclear weapons were unaccounted for. He said he was attempting to inventory the weapons when he was fired by President Boris Yeltsin in October 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/act/1997_09/lebedsept|title=Russian Officials Deny Claims Of Missing Nuclear Weapons|publisher=|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}</ref> Indeed, several US politicians have expressed worries and promised legislation addressing the threat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/1010/nuclear_dangers.html?breadcrumb=%2F|title=Nuclear Dangers: Fear Increases of Terrorists Getting Hands on 'Loose' Warheads as Security Slips|date=October 19, 1997|publisher=|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}</ref>

In 2002, the United States and Russia agreed to reduce their stockpiles to not more than 2,700 warheads each in the [[SORT]] treaty. In 2003, the US rejected Russian proposals to further reduce each nation's nuclear stockpiles to 1,500.

===Nuclear sabotage allegations from Russia===
The highest-ranking [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] defector [[Stanislav Lunev]] described alleged Soviet plans for using [[tactical nuclear weapons]] for [[sabotage]] against the United States in the event of war. He described Soviet-made [[suitcase nukes]] identified as RA-115s (or RA-115-01s for submersible weapons) which weigh from fifty to sixty pounds (23&nbsp;kg - 27&nbsp;kg). These portable bombs can last for many years if wired to an electric source. \"In case there is a loss of power, there is a battery backup. If the battery runs low, the weapon has a transmitter that sends a coded message – either by satellite or directly to a GRU post at a Russian embassy or consulate.\".<ref name=\"Lunev\">[[Stanislav Lunev]]. ''Through the Eyes of the Enemy: The Autobiography of Stanislav Lunev'', Regnery Publishing, Inc., 1998. {{ISBN|0-89526-390-4}}.</ref>

Lunev was personally looking for hiding places for weapons caches in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] area.<ref name=\"Lunev\"/> He said that \"it is surprisingly easy to smuggle nuclear weapons into the US\" either across the Mexican border or using a small transport missile that can slip though undetected when launched from a Russian airplane.<ref name=\"Lunev\"/> Searches of the areas identified by Lunev – who admits he never planted any weapons in the US – have been conducted, \"but law-enforcement officials have never found such weapons caches, with or without portable nuclear weapons\" in the US.<ref>Steve Goldstein and Chris Mondics, \"Some Weldon-backed allegations unconfirmed; Among them: A plot to crash planes into a reactor, and missing suitcase-size Soviet atomic weapons.\" ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' (15 March 2006) A7.</ref>

In 2004 interview, colonel general of [[Strategic Missile Forces|RVSN]] [[Viktor Esin]] said that Soviet small-scale nuclear bombs have only been operated by the Army. All such devices have been stored in a weapons depot within Russia, and only left it for checks at the plant which produced them.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Novikova |first1=Inna |title=Куда исчезли \"ядерные чемоданчики\"? |url=https://military.pravda.ru/46851-sadm/ |work=[[Pravda]] |date=March 29, 2004 |language=Russian}}</ref>

==Biological weapons==
{{Main|Soviet biological weapons program}}

Soviet program of [[biological weapon]]s was initially developed by the
[[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union]] (between 1945 and 1973).<ref name=\"Alibek\">Alibek, K. and S. Handelman. Biohazard: The Chilling True Story of the Largest Covert Biological Weapons Program in the World– Told from Inside by the Man Who Ran it. Delta (2000) {{ISBN|0-385-33496-6}}</ref>

The Soviet Union signed the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] on April 10, 1972 and ratified the treaty on March 26, 1975. However, it subsequently augmented its biowarfare programs. After 1975, the program of biological weapons was run primarily by the \"civilian\" [[Biopreparat]] agency, although it also included numerous facilities run by the  Soviet Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Chemical Industry, Ministry of Health, and [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=\"Alibek\"/>

According to [[Ken Alibek]], who was deputy-director of [[Biopreparat]], the Soviet biological weapons agency, and who defected to the United States in 1992, weapons were developed in labs in isolated areas of the Soviet Union including mobilization facilities at [[Omutininsk]], [[Penza]] and [[Pokrov, Vladimir Oblast|Pokrov]] and research facilities at [[Moscow]], [[Stirzhi]] and [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. These weapons were tested at several facilities most often at \"Rebirth Island\" ([[Vozrozhdeniya]]) in the [[Aral Sea]] by firing the weapons into the air above monkeys tied to posts, the monkeys would then be monitored to determine the effects. According to Alibek, although Soviet offensive program was officially ended in 1992, Russia may be still involved in the activities prohibited by BWC.<ref name=\"Alibek\"/>

In 1993, the story about the [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak]] was published in Russia. The incident occurred when [[spore]]s of [[anthrax]] were accidentally released from a military facility in the city of Sverdlovsk (formerly, and now again, [[Yekaterinburg]]) {{convert|1500|km|abbr=on}} east of Moscow on April 2, 1979. The ensuing outbreak of the disease resulted in 94 people becoming infected, 64 of whom died over a period of six weeks.<ref name=\"Alibek\"/>

==Chemical weapons==
Russia signed the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] on January 13, 1993, and ratified it on November 5, 1997. Russia declared an arsenal of 39,967 tons of [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapons]] in 1997 consisting of:
*[[blister agent]]s: [[Lewisite]], [[mustard gas|mustard]], Lewisite-mustard-mix (HL)
*[[nerve agent]]s: [[Sarin]], [[Soman]], [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]]

Ratification was followed by three years of inaction on chemical weapons destruction because of the [[August 1998 Russian financial crisis]].

Russia met its treaty obligations by destroying 1% of its chemical agents by the Chemical Weapons Convention's 2002 deadline,<ref>[http://www.opcw.org/html/global/ra_frameset.html News<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040406043031/http://www.opcw.org/html/global/ra_frameset.html |date=April 6, 2004 }}</ref> but requested technical and financial assistance and extensions on the deadlines of 2004 and 2007 due to the environmental challenges of chemical disposal. This extension procedure spelled out in the treaty has been utilized by other countries, including the [[United States and weapons of mass destruction#Chemical weapons disposal|United States]]. The extended deadline for complete destruction (April 2012) was not met.<ref name=sixty>[http://www.opcw.org/nc/news/article/global-campaign-to-destroy-chemical-weapons-passes-60-percent-mark/ Global Campaign to Destroy Chemical Weapons Passes 60 Percent Mark].

===Novichok agents===
{{Main|Novichok agent}}

A range of Novichok agents were developed and tested in the 1970s and 1980s, but the intended Novichok weapons production site at the Pavlodar Chemical Plant in [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Kazakhstan]] was still under construction when it was decided to demolish the chemical weapons building in 1987 in view of the forthcoming [[Chemical Weapons Convention]].<ref name=nti-201504>{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/kazakhstan/chemical/ |title=Kazakhstan - Chemical |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |date=April 2015 |accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref><ref name=bozheyeva-2000>{{cite report |url=https://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/npr/72bozh.pdf |title=The Pavlodar Chemical Weapons Plant in Kazakhstan: History and Legacy |last=Bozheyeva |first=Gulbarshyn |publisher=The Nonproliferation Review |date=Summer 2000 |accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>

He has competed in motor racing since 1994 in many categories, from [[Formula Three]] and [[Indy Lights]] to sportscars, GT racing and stock cars.

Collins was placed second in the Marlboro Masters Formula 3 championship event in 2000. He set the pace at the 2001 [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans 24 hours race]] in his first season for approximately four hours during the rain at night. After winning the European Stock Car Championship in 2003 [[Stock Car Speed Association|ASCAR]] [[stock car racing]] he was signed by [[PDM Racing]] to do selected rounds of the 2004 [[Indy Racing League]], but the car never appeared. In 2005, he competed in the British GT Championship in a [[Porsche 911|Porsche 996 GT3]], winning races on the way before moving up to the FIA GT Series with Ascari where he led races and scored several pole positions.

In addition to racing, Collins' company '''Collins Autosport Limited''' provides precision and stunt driving services, particularly for [[BBC Television]], including ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV Series)|Top Gear]]''<ref name=\"telegraph-outing\"/><ref name=\"times-open-secret\"/> and ''Top Gear Live'', as well as for the film industry, such as driving [[James Bond]]'s car in ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' and ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', and [[Eve Moneypenny]]'s car in ''[[Skyfall]]''.

In August 2010, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' alleged that Collins may be one of the identities of [[The Stig]]—an otherwise unidentified presenter on the ''Top Gear'' show—on the basis of financial filing made by the Collins Autosport company.{{cn|date=February 2020}} On 1 September 2010 the BBC was refused a court injunction preventing Collins from publishing an autobiography revealing himself to be The Stig.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hewage|first=Tim|title=Top Gear's The Stig Is Finally Unmasked|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Top-Gears-Stig-Is-Free-To-Publish-Autobiography-After-BBC-Lose-Bid-To-Get-Injunction/Article/201009115710574?lpos=UK_News_First_UK_News_Article_Teaser_Region_2&lid=ARTICLE_15710574_Top_Gears_Stig_Is_Free_To_Publish_Autobiography_After_BBC_Lose_Bid_To_Get_Injunction|accessdate=1 September 2010|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=1 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904071903/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Top-Gears-Stig-Is-Free-To-Publish-Autobiography-After-BBC-Lose-Bid-To-Get-Injunction/Article/201009115710574?lpos=UK_News_First_UK_News_Article_Teaser_Region_2&lid=ARTICLE_15710574_Top_Gears_Stig_Is_Free_To_Publish_Autobiography_After_BBC_Lose_Bid_To_Get_Injunction|archivedate=4 September 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 1 October 2010, it was announced that Collins would join ''[[Fifth Gear]]'' as a presenter.<ref name=\"Sweney-10-01\">{{cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark |title='The Stig' joins Channel 5's Fifth Gear|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/oct/01/the-stig-top-gear-channel-5|accessdate=1 October 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101001133637/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/oct/01/the-stig-top-gear-channel-5| archivedate= 1 October 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> In 2012 Collins joined as co-presenter of Polish [[TVN (Poland)|TVN]]'s ''[[Automaniak]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvn.pl/showbiz/nowy-sezon-automaniaka-z-legendarnym-benem-collinsem,38447,341,0,0.html |title=Nowy sezon \"Automaniaka\" z legendarnym Benem Collinsem! |publisher=Tvn.pl |date=2013-11-11 |accessdate=2015-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012032552/http://www.tvn.pl/showbiz/nowy-sezon-automaniaka-z-legendarnym-benem-collinsem,38447,341,0,0.html |archive-date=12 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In February 2014, he was added to the 'Drivers Club' of the newly formed [[FIA Formula E Championship|Formula E]] series, but did not compete in the inaugural 2014–15 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fiaformulae.com/news/formula-e-completes-drivers-club |title=Alguersuari, Minassian & Klien add names to Formula E Drivers’ Club|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508121951/http://www.fiaformulae.com/news/formula-e-completes-drivers-club|archivedate=8 May 2014|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref>

====The Stig====
[[File:The Stig British International Motor Show.jpg|right|thumb|The Stig]]
On 19 January 2009, British newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' ran a story claiming that they had \"outed\" Collins as being one of the people behind the white-suit incarnation of [[The Stig]], at the same time noting that \"Collins, from Bristol, has always denied being the Stig\".<ref name=\"telegraph-outing\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/4286448/Who-is-the-Stig-The-answer.html|title=Who is the Stig?

''[[The Times]]'', in a follow-up article, stated that the \"identity of the white-suited Stig ... has been an [[open secret]] within the motoring world for some years, with newspapers refraining from publishing his name, to uphold the spirit of the programme\" which concluded that \"a newspaper broke with the convention to out Mr Collins, 33,<!--literal quote from article DO NOT CHANGE from '33'--> after following up a story in a Bristol newspaper\".<ref name=\"times-open-secret\">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/driving/article5548705.ece|title=Identity of Top Gear's The Stig revealed as Ben Collins|first=Patrick|last=Foster|date=19 January 2009|accessdate=19 January 2009|work=The Times |location=UK }}</ref>
Similar allegations were repeated by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' during August 2010.

Two Bristol-based local newspapers had published articles a week before ''The Times'' in January 2009, on the basis of information leaked from a local art gallery. Collins had previously commissioned a [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]]-based business in September 2008, to produce a limited-edition run of poster prints.<ref name=\"western-daily\"/> Collins had initially portrayed himself as a BBC marketing executive<ref name=\"western-daily\"/> and only confirmed a more detailed connection to the ''Top Gear'' show after the signing of confidentiality agreements by the business owners.<ref name=\"western-daily\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Gear-s-Stig-reveals-identity-Bristol-gallery-owners/article-589665-detail/article.html|title=Top Gear's The Stig reveals identity to Bristol gallery owners|date=6 January 2009|accessdate=19 January 2009|work=[[Western Daily Press]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123030059/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Gear-s-Stig-reveals-identity-Bristol-gallery-owners/article-589665-detail/article.html|archivedate=23 January 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"bristol-news\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Gear-s-Stig-revealed-Bristol-firm/article-589703-detail/article.html|title=Top Gear's The Stig revealed to Bristol firm|date=6 January 2009|accessdate=19 January 2009|work=Bristol News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123030054/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Gear-s-Stig-revealed-Bristol-firm/article-589703-detail/article.html|archivedate=23 January 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
The signed poster image showed a [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flat]] scene, with The Stig positioned standing on it.<ref name=\"unmasked-at-last\"/><ref name=\"bristol-news\"/>

However, at the time ''Top Gear'' presenter [[James May]] claimed that the Stig's identity had not been outed.  There had been speculation that there may have been more than one person who plays the Stig.<ref name=\"daily-telegraph\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4321313/The-Stigs-true-identity-is-still-a-mystery-claims-Top-Gears-James-May.html|title=The Stig's true identity is still a mystery, claims Top Gear's James May|date=23 January 2009|accessdate=24 January 2009|work=Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Nick | last=Allen| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090131224929/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4321313/The-Stigs-true-identity-is-still-a-mystery-claims-Top-Gears-James-May.html| archivedate= 31 January 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

====Autobiography publication====
{{main|BBC v HarperCollins Publishers Ltd}}
During August to September 2010 the BBC started legal proceedings against Harper Collins, with the BBC attempting to obtain a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] [[injunction]] to prevent the publishing of a book entitled ''The Man in The White Suit'', apparently authored by Collins. The injunction was quashed by the High Court, allowing the possibility of the book being published on its intended release date of 16 September 2010 in the United Kingdom and 1 October 2010 in Australia.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/top-gear-creators-original-stig-living-in-sydney/story-e6frg6nf-1225919884394|title=Top Gear creator's original Stig living in Sydney|work=The Australian|date=13 September 2010|accessdate=12 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100914040100/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/top-gear-creators-original-stig-living-in-sydney/story-e6frg6nf-1225919884394| archivedate= 14 September 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>

In an exclusive interview with ''WitneyTV'' recorded on 3 September 2010 and broadcast on 7 September 2010, ''Top Gear''-presenter Jeremy Clarkson confirmed that Collins had worked as The Stig, and that Collins was \"history as far as we're concerned, he's sacked\".<ref>{{cite episode|type=Video interview |url=http://www.witneytv.co.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703122148/http://www.witneytv.co.uk/ |archivedate= 3 July 2010 |airdate=2010-09-07 |title=Jeremy Clarkson interview |series=[[Witney#Media|WitneyTV]] |seriesno=01 |number=17 |minutes=26:56–29:10 |quote=he's history as far as we're concerned, he's sacked |url-status=dead }}</ref>  On 7/8 September 2010, ''The Guardian'', ''The Sun'' and other papers re-reported Clarkson's assertions in the interview that Collins had been fired from his role on the television show.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/sep/07/jeremy-clarkson-stig-sacked|title=Jeremy Clarkson: the Stig is 'sacked'|work=The Guardian|first=Tara|last=Conlan|date=7 September 2010|accessdate=11 September 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100910085956/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/sep/07/jeremy-clarkson-stig-sacked| archivedate= 10 September 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>

In the fifteenth series Christmas special, ''Top Gear'' presenters referred to the Stig as \"The Splitter\" and publicly ridiculed the Stig, using the picture of the Stig for drive-by shooting targets.

During Collins' appearance with the military amputees broadcast in July 2011, Collins was introduced and acknowledged by ''Top Gear''-presenter Richard Hammond as \"ex-Stig ... Ben Collins\".<ref name=\"hogan\"/> Though Hammond still referred to Collins as a \"romantic novelist\", he said that \"to be honest, [he was] quite glad to see 'the old Splitter' back, and [he does] know how much giving these guys a hand means to him. So this is all right.\"

In his appearance in the ''Top Gear'' Special, '50 Years of Bond Cars', Collins was wearing a T-shirt on which was printed the words, \"I AM THE STIG.\" [[Richard Hammond]], (who interviewed Collins) reacted, saying to him, \"Nice T-shirt by the way.\" Collins admitted that he needs to \"update that a bit\", pointing to the word \"AM\", to which Hammond exclaimed, \"Was.\" After hearing about some of what Collins had been doing for the film, Hammond remarked, \"You should write a book.\"

===''Fifth Gear''===
Collins joined the presenting staff of [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]'s ''[[Fifth Gear]]'' in Series 18, participating in racing challenges on several occasions. He did not return to the cast for Series 19.

===Other work===

Following his departure from ''Top Gear'', Collins has subsequently appeared on the \"Top Gear Live\" touring show. He appeared onstage in a show in Poland and also served as a racing driver for at least one pre-recorded clip.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hammond|first1=Richard|title=Hammond, Clarkson and May found a new racing driver.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=MYJZG5Og2yg|website=YouTube|publisher=Richard Hammond|accessdate=5 October 2016}}</ref> Introducing him, Clarkson joked Collins' was \"living rough\", in a racing track paddock, as Collins was shown to be sleeping on cardboard with a shopping trolley with books and Daniel Craig face cuttouts for his possessions. Collins' role was identical to his previous one as the Stig, except wearing an open face helmet and he was referred to as \"The Ben Collins\" by Clarkson. He has written a second book, ''How To Drive: The Ultimate Guide, from the Man Who Was The Stig,'' published in 2014.

Collins served as a consultant during the development of [[Project CARS]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/ex-stig-ben-collins-talks-development-of-project-cars/|title=How The Stig traded in his white helmet for an Oculus Rift and Project Cars|date=26 May 2016|publisher=}}</ref> and [[Project CARS 2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://me.askmen.com/cars/1103510/article/ben-collins-on-why-project-cars-2-is-the-best-racing-sim-yet|title=Ben Collins On Why Project Cars 2 Is The Best Racing Sim Yet|date=16 February 2017|publisher=}}</ref>

In 2007 Collins started a career as a stunt driver in the Nicolas Cage movie \"National Treasure 2.\" This followed by multiple films for the James Bond franchise <ref>https://www.irishnews.com/magazine/entertainment/2019/06/20/news/james-bond-stunt-driver-could-not-bare-to-watch-aston-martin-destroyed-1645955/</ref> and other blockbusters including \"Dark Knight Rises\", \"Han Solo: A Star Wars Story\", \"Jack Ryan\", and \"Mission Impossible.\" He had a dual role as a stunt driver and actor in [[Ford_v_Ferrari|\"Ford v Ferrari / Le Mans '66\"]] in the role of [[Denny Hulme]] <ref>https://www.motorious.com/articles/news/370554/ford-v-ferrari-excitement-building</ref>

He has competed in motor racing since 1994 in many categories, from [[Formula Three]] and [[Indy Lights]] to sportscars, GT racing and stock cars.

Collins was placed second in the Marlboro Masters Formula 3 championship event in 2000. He set the pace at the 2001 [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans 24 hours race]] in his first season for approximately four hours during the rain at night. After winning the European Stock Car Championship in 2003 [[Stock Car Speed Association|ASCAR]] [[stock car racing]] he was signed by [[PDM Racing]] to do selected rounds of the 2004 [[Indy Racing League]], but the car never appeared. In 2005, he competed in the British GT Championship in a [[Porsche 911|Porsche 996 GT3]], winning races on the way before moving up to the FIA GT Series with Ascari where he led races and scored several pole positions.

In addition to racing, Collins' company '''Collins Autosport Limited''' provides precision and stunt driving services, particularly for [[BBC Television]], including ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV Series)|Top Gear]]''<ref name=\"telegraph-outing\"/><ref name=\"times-open-secret\"/> and ''Top Gear Live'', as well as for the film industry, such as driving [[James Bond]]'s car in ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' and ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', and [[Eve Moneypenny]]'s car in ''[[Skyfall]]''.

In August 2010, the ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' alleged that Collins may be one of the identities of [[The Stig]]—an otherwise unidentified presenter on the ''Top Gear'' show—on the basis of financial filing made by the Collins Autosport company.{{cn|date=February 2020}} On 1 September 2010 the BBC was refused a court injunction preventing Collins from publishing an autobiography revealing himself to be The Stig.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hewage|first=Tim|title=Top Gear's The Stig Is Finally Unmasked|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Top-Gears-Stig-Is-Free-To-Publish-Autobiography-After-BBC-Lose-Bid-To-Get-Injunction/Article/201009115710574?lpos=UK_News_First_UK_News_Article_Teaser_Region_2&lid=ARTICLE_15710574_Top_Gears_Stig_Is_Free_To_Publish_Autobiography_After_BBC_Lose_Bid_To_Get_Injunction|accessdate=1 September 2010|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=1 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904071903/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Top-Gears-Stig-Is-Free-To-Publish-Autobiography-After-BBC-Lose-Bid-To-Get-Injunction/Article/201009115710574?lpos=UK_News_First_UK_News_Article_Teaser_Region_2&lid=ARTICLE_15710574_Top_Gears_Stig_Is_Free_To_Publish_Autobiography_After_BBC_Lose_Bid_To_Get_Injunction|archivedate=4 September 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 1 October 2010, it was announced that Collins would join ''[[Fifth Gear]]'' as a presenter.<ref name=\"Sweney-10-01\">{{cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark |title='The Stig' joins Channel 5's Fifth Gear|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/oct/01/the-stig-top-gear-channel-5|accessdate=1 October 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101001133637/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/oct/01/the-stig-top-gear-channel-5| archivedate= 1 October 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> In 2012 Collins joined as co-presenter of Polish [[TVN (Poland)|TVN]]'s ''[[Automaniak]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvn.pl/showbiz/nowy-sezon-automaniaka-z-legendarnym-benem-collinsem,38447,341,0,0.html |title=Nowy sezon \"Automaniaka\" z legendarnym Benem Collinsem! |publisher=Tvn.pl |date=2013-11-11 |accessdate=2015-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012032552/http://www.tvn.pl/showbiz/nowy-sezon-automaniaka-z-legendarnym-benem-collinsem,38447,341,0,0.html |archive-date=12 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In February 2014, he was added to the 'Drivers Club' of the newly formed [[FIA Formula E Championship|Formula E]] series, but did not compete in the inaugural 2014–15 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fiaformulae.com/news/formula-e-completes-drivers-club |title=Alguersuari, Minassian & Klien add names to Formula E Drivers’ Club|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508121951/http://www.fiaformulae.com/news/formula-e-completes-drivers-club|archivedate=8 May 2014|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref>

====The Stig====
[[File:The Stig British International Motor Show.jpg|right|thumb|The Stig]]
On 19 January 2009, British newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' ran a story claiming that they had \"outed\" Collins as being one of the people behind the white-suit incarnation of [[The Stig]], at the same time noting that \"Collins, from Bristol, has always denied being the Stig\".<ref name=\"telegraph-outing\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/4286448/Who-is-the-Stig-The-answer.html|title=Who is the Stig?

''[[The Times]]'', in a follow-up article, stated that the \"identity of the white-suited Stig ... has been an [[open secret]] within the motoring world for some years, with newspapers refraining from publishing his name, to uphold the spirit of the programme\" which concluded that \"a newspaper broke with the convention to out Mr Collins, 33,<!--literal quote from article DO NOT CHANGE from '33'--> after following up a story in a Bristol newspaper\".<ref name=\"times-open-secret\">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/driving/article5548705.ece|title=Identity of Top Gear's The Stig revealed as Ben Collins|first=Patrick|last=Foster|date=19 January 2009|accessdate=19 January 2009|work=The Times |location=UK }}</ref>
Similar allegations were repeated by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' during August 2010.

Two Bristol-based local newspapers had published articles a week before ''The Times'' in January 2009, on the basis of information leaked from a local art gallery. Collins had previously commissioned a [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]]-based business in September 2008, to produce a limited-edition run of poster prints.<ref name=\"western-daily\"/> Collins had initially portrayed himself as a BBC marketing executive<ref name=\"western-daily\"/> and only confirmed a more detailed connection to the ''Top Gear'' show after the signing of confidentiality agreements by the business owners.<ref name=\"western-daily\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Gear-s-Stig-reveals-identity-Bristol-gallery-owners/article-589665-detail/article.html|title=Top Gear's The Stig reveals identity to Bristol gallery owners|date=6 January 2009|accessdate=19 January 2009|work=[[Western Daily Press]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123030059/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Gear-s-Stig-reveals-identity-Bristol-gallery-owners/article-589665-detail/article.html|archivedate=23 January 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"bristol-news\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Gear-s-Stig-revealed-Bristol-firm/article-589703-detail/article.html|title=Top Gear's The Stig revealed to Bristol firm|date=6 January 2009|accessdate=19 January 2009|work=Bristol News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123030054/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Gear-s-Stig-revealed-Bristol-firm/article-589703-detail/article.html|archivedate=23 January 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

However, at the time ''Top Gear'' presenter [[James May]] claimed that the Stig's identity had not been outed.  There had been speculation that there may have been more than one person who plays the Stig.<ref name=\"daily-telegraph\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4321313/The-Stigs-true-identity-is-still-a-mystery-claims-Top-Gears-James-May.html|title=The Stig's true identity is still a mystery, claims Top Gear's James May|date=23 January 2009|accessdate=24 January 2009|work=Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Nick | last=Allen| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090131224929/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4321313/The-Stigs-true-identity-is-still-a-mystery-claims-Top-Gears-James-May.html| archivedate= 31 January 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

====Autobiography publication====
{{main|BBC v HarperCollins Publishers Ltd}}
During August to September 2010 the BBC started legal proceedings against Harper Collins, with the BBC attempting to obtain a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] [[injunction]] to prevent the publishing of a book entitled ''The Man in The White Suit'', apparently authored by Collins. The injunction was quashed by the High Court, allowing the possibility of the book being published on its intended release date of 16 September 2010 in the United Kingdom and 1 October 2010 in Australia.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/top-gear-creators-original-stig-living-in-sydney/story-e6frg6nf-1225919884394|title=Top Gear creator's original Stig living in Sydney|work=The Australian|date=13 September 2010|accessdate=12 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100914040100/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/top-gear-creators-original-stig-living-in-sydney/story-e6frg6nf-1225919884394| archivedate= 14 September 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>

In an exclusive interview with ''WitneyTV'' recorded on 3 September 2010 and broadcast on 7 September 2010, ''Top Gear''-presenter Jeremy Clarkson confirmed that Collins had worked as The Stig, and that Collins was \"history as far as we're concerned, he's sacked\".<ref>{{cite episode|type=Video interview |url=http://www.witneytv.co.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703122148/http://www.witneytv.co.uk/ |archivedate= 3 July 2010 |airdate=2010-09-07 |title=Jeremy Clarkson interview |series=[[Witney#Media|WitneyTV]] |seriesno=01 |number=17 |minutes=26:56–29:10 |quote=he's history as far as we're concerned, he's sacked |url-status=dead }}</ref>  On 7/8 September 2010, ''The Guardian'', ''The Sun'' and other papers re-reported Clarkson's assertions in the interview that Collins had been fired from his role on the television show.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/sep/07/jeremy-clarkson-stig-sacked|title=Jeremy Clarkson: the Stig is 'sacked'|work=The Guardian|first=Tara|last=Conlan|date=7 September 2010|accessdate=11 September 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100910085956/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/sep/07/jeremy-clarkson-stig-sacked| archivedate= 10 September 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>

In the fifteenth series Christmas special, ''Top Gear'' presenters referred to the Stig as \"The Splitter\" and publicly ridiculed the Stig, using the picture of the Stig for drive-by shooting targets.

During Collins' appearance with the military amputees broadcast in July 2011, Collins was introduced and acknowledged by ''Top Gear''-presenter Richard Hammond as \"ex-Stig ... Ben Collins\".<ref name=\"hogan\"/> Though Hammond still referred to Collins as a \"romantic novelist\", he said that \"to be honest, [he was] quite glad to see 'the old Splitter' back, and [he does] know how much giving these guys a hand means to him. So this is all right.\"

In his appearance in the ''Top Gear'' Special, '50 Years of Bond Cars', Collins was wearing a T-shirt on which was printed the words, \"I AM THE STIG.\" [[Richard Hammond]], (who interviewed Collins) reacted, saying to him, \"Nice T-shirt by the way.\" Collins admitted that he needs to \"update that a bit\", pointing to the word \"AM\", to which Hammond exclaimed, \"Was.\" After hearing about some of what Collins had been doing for the film, Hammond remarked, \"You should write a book.\"

===''Fifth Gear''===
Collins joined the presenting staff of [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]'s ''[[Fifth Gear]]'' in Series 18, participating in racing challenges on several occasions. He did not return to the cast for Series 19.

===Other work===

Following his departure from ''Top Gear'', Collins has subsequently appeared on the \"Top Gear Live\" touring show. He appeared onstage in a show in Poland and also served as a racing driver for at least one pre-recorded clip.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hammond|first1=Richard|title=Hammond, Clarkson and May found a new racing driver.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=MYJZG5Og2yg|website=YouTube|publisher=Richard Hammond|accessdate=5 October 2016}}</ref> Introducing him, Clarkson joked Collins' was \"living rough\", in a racing track paddock, as Collins was shown to be sleeping on cardboard with a shopping trolley with books and Daniel Craig face cuttouts for his possessions. Collins' role was identical to his previous one as the Stig, except wearing an open face helmet and he was referred to as \"The Ben Collins\" by Clarkson. He has written a second book, ''How To Drive: The Ultimate Guide, from the Man Who Was The Stig,'' published in 2014.

Collins served as a consultant during the development of [[Project CARS]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/ex-stig-ben-collins-talks-development-of-project-cars/|title=How The Stig traded in his white helmet for an Oculus Rift and Project Cars|date=26 May 2016|publisher=}}</ref> and [[Project CARS 2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://me.askmen.com/cars/1103510/article/ben-collins-on-why-project-cars-2-is-the-best-racing-sim-yet|title=Ben Collins On Why Project Cars 2 Is The Best Racing Sim Yet|date=16 February 2017|publisher=}}</ref>

In 2007 Collins started a career as a stunt driver in the Nicolas Cage movie \"National Treasure 2.\" This followed by multiple films for the James Bond franchise <ref>https://www.irishnews.com/magazine/entertainment/2019/06/20/news/james-bond-stunt-driver-could-not-bare-to-watch-aston-martin-destroyed-1645955/</ref> and other blockbusters including \"Dark Knight Rises\", \"Han Solo: A Star Wars Story\", \"Jack Ryan\", and \"Mission Impossible.\" He had a dual role as a stunt driver and actor in [[Ford_v_Ferrari|\"Ford v Ferrari / Le Mans '66\"]] in the role of [[Denny Hulme]] <ref>https://www.motorious.com/articles/news/370554/ford-v-ferrari-excitement-building</ref>

This is a '''list of law enforcement agencies in [[Louisiana]]'''.

According to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics' 2008 ''Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies,'' the state had 348 law enforcement agencies employing 18,050 sworn police officers, about 405 for each 100,000 residents. This is the largest ratio of policemen to residents of any state and compares to a national average of 251 to 100,000.<ref>2008 Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies, by Brian A Reaves, US Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs,  Bureau of Justice Statistics, July 2011</ref>

'''Individual and political action on climate change''' can take many forms. Many actions aim to build social and political support to limit, and subsequently reduce, the concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHGs) in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], with the goal of [[Climate change mitigation|mitigating climate change]]. Other actions seek to address the ethical and moral aspects of [[climate justice]], especially with regard to the anticipated unequal impacts of [[climate change adaptation]].

Political action can change laws and regulations that relate to [[climate change]].

[[Carbon price|Carbon pricing]] methods, such as a [[carbon tax]] or an [[emissions trading]] system, are favored by many economists as the most efficient and effective means to reduce GHG emissions, and are increasingly being deployed around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/25160|title=State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 2016|last=The World Bank|date=October 2016|website=The World Bank|access-date=4 Feb 2017}}</ref> In the U.S., groups such as the bipartisan legislative Climate Solutions Caucus<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/274061-creating-a-bipartisan-climate-to-discuss-climate|title=Creating a bipartisan climate to discuss climate change in Congress|last=Picard|first=Joe|date=2016-03-24|newspaper=TheHill|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref> and the [[Citizens' Climate Lobby]] work to build support for carbon pricing.

[[File:Climate change protesters march in Paris (45308615021).jpg|thumb|Pictured above is a protest in the streets of Paris against climate change.]]
Regulations can strengthen GHG [[emission standard]]s from particular sectors of the economy, such as the EPA's proposed [[Clean Power Plan]] for United States power plants, or vehicle standards in [[European emission standards|Europe]] and the [[United States emission standards|United States]].

Political action can also gain [[Media coverage of climate change|media]] and public attention to climate change. Political action from the community, however, is often challenged by interests within the [[fossil-fuel industry]],<ref>Hamilton, Clive (2007), \"[[Scorcher: The Dirty Politics of Climate Change]]\"</ref><ref>[[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] \"Betrayal of Science and Reason: How Anti-Environmental Rhetoric Threatens Our Future\" {{ISBN|978-1-55963-484-7}}</ref> which have been charged with promoting [[climate change denial]] views<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15092015/Exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming|title=Exxon's Own Research Confirmed Fossil Fuels' Role in Global Warming Decades Ago {{!}} InsideClimate News|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref> in order to hold off a \"[[carbon bubble]]\" valuation crash.

There are many forms of political action on climate change including letter writing, direct [[lobbying]], and [[public shaming]] of politicians and media organizations. Political action campaigns require building a base of support at local level.

There are many facts that point to the existence of [[climate change]]. The plentiful hurricanes, droughts, and fires are all in part due to the ever changing atmosphere caused by climate change. One of the ways in which the human race can get in front of this change is through political action.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asyousow.org/our-work/energy/climate-change|title=Climate Change|website=As You Sow|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-30}}</ref> Legislative action is one strategy that politicians are using to combat carbon emissions. The way these laws will come about is via political action. [[Greenhouse gas|Carbon emissions]] are a significant causing factor for climate change and by putting federal regulations such as a carbon tax there will overall be a decrease in carbon emissions. This allows the private sector to decide how to do so cost effectively which in turn benefits the environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.c2es.org/content/federal-action-on-climate/|title=Federal Action on Climate|date=2017-10-21|website=Center for Climate and Energy Solutions|access-date=2019-04-01}}</ref> The private sector is one deciding factor in how governments enact their policies. In the case of climate change an action that needs to be taken is one that influences them rather than the other way around.

=== Activist movements{{anchor|Protest movements}}===
{{Main|Climate movement}}
Political figures have a vested interest in remaining on the good side of the public. This is because in democratic countries the public are the ones electing these government officials. Thus keeping up with protests is a way they can ensure they have the public's wants in mind.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ruud Woutersa|first=Stefaan Walgrave|date=2017|title=Demonstrating Power: How Protest Persuades Political Representatives|url=http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/attach/journals/apr17asrfeature.pdf|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=|pages=|via=American Sociological Association}}</ref> Climate change is a prevalent issue in society. Some believe that solutions to it can be increased by actions taken by individuals and communities. Through conservation, policy change, and innovation the public can make a positive change to decrease the emission of fossil fuels and put a gradual end to climate change. There are many organizations that have formed in order to bring light to this large issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.climategen.org/take-action/act-climate-change/|title=Act on Climate Change|website=Climate Generation: A Will Steger Legacy|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref>

The [[Earth Day Network]] is an organization on a mission to put an end to climate change. Their goal is education, expansion, and activation of an environmentally conscious movement worldwide to bring more attention to this significant issue. Over one billion people participate in Earth day activities and with an uptick in these movements the people can begin to make a difference.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.earthday.org/about/|title=About Us|website=Earth Day Network|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>[[File:Climate March 1151 (34327144386).jpg|thumb|Placard \"Change the administration, not the climate\", at the [[People's Climate March (2017)]].]]

The [[climate movement]] has emerged in recent years, given there is an increased awareness of the importance of [[global warming]] as a factor in a range of issues. Many [[Environmental policy|environmental]], [[economics of global warming|economic]], and [[social issues]] find common ground in [[mitigation of global warming]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/insights/sustainabledevelopmentlinkingeconomysocietyenvironment.htm |title=Sustainable Development: Linking economy, society, environment |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=oecd.org |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] |access-date=August 30, 2016 |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/publications/journals/weather-climate-and-society/|title=Weather, Climate, and Society|first=Comments and Reply|last=Exchanges?|website=American Meteorological Society}}</ref>

To raise awareness of climate issues, a global climate strike took place for a week in late September 2019: countries around the world showed unity within their communities as people rallied together in groups- demanding action to take place for a better future and swarming the streets of cities to march and voice their dissatisfaction with the environment they currently live in.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalclimatestrike.net/|title=Global Climate Strike → A Historic Week|website=Global Climate Strike → Sep. 20–27|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-28}}</ref>

A number of groups from around the world have come together to work on the issue of global warming. [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) from diverse fields of work have united on this issue. A [[coalition]] of 50 NGOs called [[Stop Climate Chaos]] launched in Britain in 2005 to highlight the issue of climate change.

The [[Campaign against Climate Change]] was created to focus purely on the issue of climate change and to pressure governments into action by building a protest movement of sufficient magnitude to effect political change.

[[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] is an event typically held on the last Friday of every month in various cities around the world wherein [[bicyclist]]s and, less frequently, [[unicycle|unicyclists]], [[skateboard]]ers, [[inline skate]]rs, [[rollerskates|roller skaters]] and other self-propelled commuters take to the streets ''[[en masse]].'' While the ride was founded in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] with the idea of drawing attention to how unfriendly the city was to bicyclists, the leaderless structure of Critical Mass makes it impossible to assign it any one specific goal. In fact, the purpose of Critical Mass is not formalized beyond the [[direct action]] of meeting at a set location and time and traveling as a group through city or town streets.

One of the elements of the [[Occupy movement]] is global warming action.

=== Climate disobedience ===
{{See also|Ende Gelände 2016|Ende Gelände 2017|Ende Gelände 2018|Ende Gelände 2019|Extinction Rebellion}}

Climate disobedience is a form of [[civil disobedience]], deliberate action intended to critique government climate policy. In 2008, American climate activist [[Tim DeChristopher]] posed as a bidder at an auction of US [[Bureau of Land Management]] oil and gas leases of public land in [[Utah]], won the auction, reneged on payment, and was imprisoned for 21 months. In September 2015, five climate activists known as the Delta 5 obstructed an oil train in [[Everett, Washington]]. At trial, the Delta 5 were allowed the [[necessity (criminal law)|necessity defense]], that is, breaking a law in the service of preventing a greater harm. After testimony, the judge determined the grounds for the necessity defense were not met and instructed the jury to disregard testimony admitted under the necessity defense. The Delta 5 were fined for trespassing but were acquitted of more serious charges.<ref>{{cite news |title=How to Stop an Oil Train: The Hearts-and-Minds Climate Defense That Won Over a Courtroom |magazine=[[Yes!

== International political frameworks ==

=== Paris Agreement ===
[[File:Kyoto protocol parties and 2012-2020 commitments.svg|thumb|Map of countries participating in revised Kyoto Protocol and their commitments.]]
The [[Paris Agreement]] is an agreement within the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) dealing with [[Climate change mitigation|greenhouse gases emissions mitigation]], [[Climate change adaptation|adaptation]] and finance starting in the year 2020. The language of the agreement was negotiated by representatives of 195 countries at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC]] (COP21) in [[Paris]] and adopted by consensus on 12 December 2015.

The head of the Paris Conference, France's foreign minister [[Laurent Fabius]], called the plan \"ambitious and balanced\" and an \"historic turning point\" in the goal of reducing global warming. [[Paris Agreement#Concerns|Critics note]] that the agreement is not sufficient to achieve the 2&nbsp;°C warming target, and the lack of any binding enforcement mechanism. Subsequent Conference of the Parties meetings are expected to address shortcomings in the Paris Agreement.

Amid fierce opposition from scientists and other leaders around the world, U.S. President Donald Trump has [[Political positions of Donald Trump#Opposition to international cooperation on climate change|pledged to pull out of the Paris Agreement]].

[[Paris Agreement|The Paris Agreement]], which was brought to discussion on November 12, 2016, was made with a goal in mind to unite all countries against the threat of climate change. This argument stipulates that all countries involved contribute financially and regularly report on emissions and the status of national progress. At this point, over half the countries in Convention who were responsible for over half of greenhouse emissions, had ratified.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement|title=The Paris Agreement}}</ref>

=== The European Union  ===
[[File:Secretary Kerry and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon Address Reporters.jpg|thumb|Pictured above are US Secretary Kerry and the UN Secretary-General at the COP21 meeting of the UNFCCC in Paris.]]
Under the [[Kyoto Protocol]], countries with targets could elect to reach these targets in co-operation with other countries. The [[European Union]] has decided to work as a unit to meet its emissions targets. The European climate change program attempts to do this by utilising an emissions trading scheme known as the [[European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme]]. The principle of this scheme is quite simple: to make their legally binding commitments under Kyoto, countries can either make these savings within their own country, or they can buy these emissions reductions from other countries. These other countries would still need to meet their Kyoto targets, but the use of a [[free market]] system ensures the reductions are made for the least possible costs. Most reductions are made where these reductions are cheapest, and the excess reductions can be sold on to other countries where such cuts would be less economically viable. The EU ETS is arguably the global template for emissions trading schemes that are being implemented globally (China, South Korea, Tokyo and others).<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1142/S2345748114500031|title = Framing It Right: China–EU Relations and Patterns of Interaction on Climate Change|journal = Chinese Journal of Urban and Environmental Studies|volume = 02|pages = 1450003|year = 2014|last1 = Gippner|first1 = Olivia}}</ref>

The commitment of the [[European Union]] to cut back on its excessive green house gas emissions came from the implementation of the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. Since its application, the Doha amendments, which were made to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, have come to regulate this protocol and update the Union's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This second round of the Kyoto Protocol created a legally binding agreement for participating EU countries until 2020. Under this plan, by 2030, there are hopes of the EU cutting their emissions by 40%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/eu-conclude-ratification-second-kyoto-protocol-commitment-period-end-year_en|title=EU to conclude ratification for second Kyoto Protocol commitment period by end of this year}}</ref>


States that become more involving or are and concerned about ability are more than likely to have more consistency; compared to the least become more refrained with agreements that comply decrease of legalization. “Empirical analyses of ratification of the FCCC and the Kyoto Protocol yield strong support for these propositions” .<ref>{{cite journal |last1=von Stein |first1=Jana |title=The International Law and Politics of Climate Change |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |date=April 2008 |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=243–268 |doi=10.1177/0022002707313692 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022002707313692 |issn=0022-0027}}</ref>

=== Contraction and Convergence ===
The concept of Cap, [[Contraction and Convergence]] was proposed as a replacement to the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto agreement]]. The idea here is that the limits to carbon emissions need to be capped at 350-450 parts per million, currently{{When|date=October 2019}} considered to produce a raise in world temperatures above pre-industrial levels of between 1 and 2 degrees Celsius. It is currently{{When|date=October 2019}} believed that further increases would bring about major positive feedbacks (the burning of forests and the loss of carbon from soils and oceans) which currently limit greenhouse gas emissions, and would lead to a run-away global warming similar to the [[Eocene]] period, during which there was no ice at the poles.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

To sustain this figure, it has been proposed that on equity grounds, all people should be allocated an equal carbon footprint (currently about 2 tonnes per person, which by 2050 could fall to 1.5 tonnes per person through population increase). World per capita carbon emissions, currently in excess of 4 tonnes per person needs to contract to those levels, if these targets are to be met.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carbonsense.com/|title=CarbonSense|website=CarbonSense}}</ref> As a result, in the name of global and inter-generational equity, policies needing to be instituted need to converge, over a fixed period towards this figure for every country. A trading regime, whereby which countries in excess of these figures (from example the [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States|US at 20 tonnes per capita]]), purchase [[carbon credit]]s from a country using less than its allocation (e.g. [[Kenya]] at 1.3 tonnes per capita), is considered by many as the best way of solving this problem.

For example, the Contract and Converge strategy was adopted by India, [[PRC|China]] and many African countries as the basis for future negotiations. The UK [[Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution]] said in 2000 \"the [[UK]] should be prepared to accept the contraction and convergence principle is the basis for international agreement on greenhouse gas emissions\".<ref>Meyer, Aubrey (2000), \"Contraction and Convergence:The Global Solution to Climate Change\" Schumacher Briefings 5, published by Green Books on behalf of the [[E. F. Schumacher|Schumacher]] Society</ref>

In 2015, the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] met in Paris to negotiate a new agreement. This meeting was the [[COP21|21st Conference of Parties]] (COP21). In this agreement, the goal was to keep temperatures under 1.5 degrees Celsius. While this goal was seen as progress in the fight against climate change, some more liable countries saw this as unattainable. They also thought some important steps were not taken during this meeting; however, everyone seemed optimistic for the future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-ir.info/2016/04/11/climate-change-and-international-relations/|title=Climate Change and International Relations|date=April 11, 2016}}</ref>

== Sub-national level action ==
Some states, regions, and cities in the world are taking the lead on developing emissions reduction methods in the absence of national policy, and may provide models for future national efforts. Their efforts are achieving real measurable emissions reductions and by pursuing policies and programs that have climate benefits, they have promoted state economic development, improved air quality and trimmed their vulnerability to energy price spikes. In the long run, addressing climate change will require comprehensive national policy and international agreements. However, in the US, due to absence of federal policy, states and regions are taking the lead on developing policies that may provide models for future national efforts.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite paper |author= Engel, Kirsten and Barak Orbach |title= Micro-Motives for State and Local Climate Change Initiatives |version= |publisher= [[Harvard Law & Policy Review]], Vol. 2, pp. 119-137 |year= 2008 |ssrn= 1014749 |format= }}</ref>

=== Carbon Conversations ===
The Carbon Conversations is a [[psychosocial]] project that focuses on the [[Moral agency|agency]] of individuals to encourage personal action to reduce carbon emissions. The project touches on five main topics: i) home energy; ii) food; iii) travel; iv) consumption and waste; and v) talking with family and friends. The project understands that individuals often fail to adopt low-carbon lifestyles not because of practical barriers to change (e.g.: there is no renewable energy available), but because of aspects related to their values, emotions, and identity. The project offers a supportive group experience that helps people reduce their personal carbon dioxide emissions by 1 tonne {{CO2}} on average and aim at halving it in the long term. They deal with the difficulties of change by connecting to values, emotions and identity. The groups are based on a [[psychosocial]] understanding of how people change. Groups of 6-8 members meet six or twelve times with trained facilitators in homes, community centres, workplaces or other venues. The meetings create a non-judgmental atmosphere where people are encouraged to make serious lifestyle changes.

=== Energy Usage ===
On the global scale, the utilization of energy speaks to a wide margin of people. The biggest wellspring of [[greenhouse gas emissions]] are from human activities. Around 66% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions are connected to consuming fossil fuels for energy to utilize for warming, power, transport and industry. In Europe, as well, energy processes are the biggest producer of
greenhouse gases, 78% of total EU emissions in 2015.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Energy and climate change|url=https://www.eea.europa.eu/signals/signals-2017/articles/energy-and-climate-change|language=en}}</ref>

=== Consumers and diet ===
The 2019 [[World Scientists' Warning to Humanity#2019 warning on the climate change|World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency]], endorsed by over 11,000 scientists from more than 150 countries, stated that \"eating mostly plant-based foods while reducing the global consumption of animal products, especially ruminant livestock, can improve human health and significantly lower GHG emissions.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Ripple |first1=William J.|last2=Wolf|first2=Christopher |last3= Newsome |first3=Thomas M |last4=Barnard |first4= Phoebe  |last5= Moomaw |first5=William R |date=November 5, 2019 |title=World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency |url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biz088/5610806 |journal=[[BioScience]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1093/biosci/biz088}}</ref>

'''Individual and political action on climate change''' can take many forms. Many actions aim to build social and political support to limit, and subsequently reduce, the concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHGs) in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], with the goal of [[Climate change mitigation|mitigating climate change]]. Other actions seek to address the ethical and moral aspects of [[climate justice]], especially with regard to the anticipated unequal impacts of [[climate change adaptation]].

== Political action ==
{{Main|Politics of global warming}}
Political action can change laws and regulations that relate to [[climate change]].

[[Carbon price|Carbon pricing]] methods, such as a [[carbon tax]] or an [[emissions trading]] system, are favored by many economists as the most efficient and effective means to reduce GHG emissions, and are increasingly being deployed around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/25160|title=State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 2016|last=The World Bank|date=October 2016|website=The World Bank|access-date=4 Feb 2017}}</ref> In the U.S., groups such as the bipartisan legislative Climate Solutions Caucus<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/274061-creating-a-bipartisan-climate-to-discuss-climate|title=Creating a bipartisan climate to discuss climate change in Congress|last=Picard|first=Joe|date=2016-03-24|newspaper=TheHill|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref> and the [[Citizens' Climate Lobby]] work to build support for carbon pricing. The first bipartisan climate policy in 10 years was introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2018 as the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividends Act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://grist.org/article/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-bipartisan-carbon-tax/|title=Is the Green New Deal the only way forward?|date=2018-12-10|website=Grist|language=en|access-date=2018-12-14}}</ref>
[[File:Climate change protesters march in Paris (45308615021).jpg|thumb|Pictured above is a protest in the streets of Paris against climate change.]]
Regulations can strengthen GHG [[emission standard]]s from particular sectors of the economy, such as the EPA's proposed [[Clean Power Plan]] for United States power plants, or vehicle standards in [[European emission standards|Europe]] and the [[United States emission standards|United States]].

Political action can also gain [[Media coverage of climate change|media]] and public attention to climate change. Political action from the community, however, is often challenged by interests within the [[fossil-fuel industry]],<ref>Hamilton, Clive (2007), \"[[Scorcher: The Dirty Politics of Climate Change]]\"</ref><ref>[[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] \"Betrayal of Science and Reason: How Anti-Environmental Rhetoric Threatens Our Future\" {{ISBN|978-1-55963-484-7}}</ref> which have been charged with promoting [[climate change denial]] views<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15092015/Exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming|title=Exxon's Own Research Confirmed Fossil Fuels' Role in Global Warming Decades Ago {{!}} InsideClimate News|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref> in order to hold off a \"[[carbon bubble]]\" valuation crash.

There are many forms of political action on climate change including letter writing, direct [[lobbying]], and [[public shaming]] of politicians and media organizations. Political action campaigns require building a base of support at local level.

There are many facts that point to the existence of [[climate change]]. The plentiful hurricanes, droughts, and fires are all in part due to the ever changing atmosphere caused by climate change. One of the ways in which the human race can get in front of this change is through political action.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asyousow.org/our-work/energy/climate-change|title=Climate Change|website=As You Sow|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-30}}</ref> Legislative action is one strategy that politicians are using to combat carbon emissions. The way these laws will come about is via political action. [[Greenhouse gas|Carbon emissions]] are a significant causing factor for climate change and by putting federal regulations such as a carbon tax there will overall be a decrease in carbon emissions. This allows the private sector to decide how to do so cost effectively which in turn benefits the environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.c2es.org/content/federal-action-on-climate/|title=Federal Action on Climate|date=2017-10-21|website=Center for Climate and Energy Solutions|access-date=2019-04-01}}</ref> The private sector is one deciding factor in how governments enact their policies. In the case of climate change an action that needs to be taken is one that influences them rather than the other way around.

=== Activist movements{{anchor|Protest movements}}===
{{Main|Climate movement}}
Political figures have a vested interest in remaining on the good side of the public. This is because in democratic countries the public are the ones electing these government officials. Thus keeping up with protests is a way they can ensure they have the public's wants in mind.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ruud Woutersa|first=Stefaan Walgrave|date=2017|title=Demonstrating Power: How Protest Persuades Political Representatives|url=http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/attach/journals/apr17asrfeature.pdf|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=|pages=|via=American Sociological Association}}</ref> Climate change is a prevalent issue in society. Some believe that solutions to it can be increased by actions taken by individuals and communities. Through conservation, policy change, and innovation the public can make a positive change to decrease the emission of fossil fuels and put a gradual end to climate change. There are many organizations that have formed in order to bring light to this large issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.climategen.org/take-action/act-climate-change/|title=Act on Climate Change|website=Climate Generation: A Will Steger Legacy|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref>

The [[Earth Day Network]] is an organization on a mission to put an end to climate change. Their goal is education, expansion, and activation of an environmentally conscious movement worldwide to bring more attention to this significant issue. Over one billion people participate in Earth day activities and with an uptick in these movements the people can begin to make a difference.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.earthday.org/about/|title=About Us|website=Earth Day Network|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>[[File:Climate March 1151 (34327144386).jpg|thumb|Placard \"Change the administration, not the climate\", at the [[People's Climate March (2017)]].]]

The [[climate movement]] has emerged in recent years, given there is an increased awareness of the importance of [[global warming]] as a factor in a range of issues. Many [[Environmental policy|environmental]], [[economics of global warming|economic]], and [[social issues]] find common ground in [[mitigation of global warming]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/insights/sustainabledevelopmentlinkingeconomysocietyenvironment.htm |title=Sustainable Development: Linking economy, society, environment |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=oecd.org |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] |access-date=August 30, 2016 |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/publications/journals/weather-climate-and-society/|title=Weather, Climate, and Society|first=Comments and Reply|last=Exchanges?|website=American Meteorological Society}}</ref>

To raise awareness of climate issues, a global climate strike took place for a week in late September 2019: countries around the world showed unity within their communities as people rallied together in groups- demanding action to take place for a better future and swarming the streets of cities to march and voice their dissatisfaction with the environment they currently live in.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalclimatestrike.net/|title=Global Climate Strike → A Historic Week|website=Global Climate Strike → Sep. 20–27|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-28}}</ref>

A number of groups from around the world have come together to work on the issue of global warming. [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) from diverse fields of work have united on this issue. A [[coalition]] of 50 NGOs called [[Stop Climate Chaos]] launched in Britain in 2005 to highlight the issue of climate change.

The [[Campaign against Climate Change]] was created to focus purely on the issue of climate change and to pressure governments into action by building a protest movement of sufficient magnitude to effect political change.

[[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] is an event typically held on the last Friday of every month in various cities around the world wherein [[bicyclist]]s and, less frequently, [[unicycle|unicyclists]], [[skateboard]]ers, [[inline skate]]rs, [[rollerskates|roller skaters]] and other self-propelled commuters take to the streets ''[[en masse]].'' While the ride was founded in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] with the idea of drawing attention to how unfriendly the city was to bicyclists, the leaderless structure of Critical Mass makes it impossible to assign it any one specific goal. In fact, the purpose of Critical Mass is not formalized beyond the [[direct action]] of meeting at a set location and time and traveling as a group through city or town streets.

One of the elements of the [[Occupy movement]] is global warming action.

Following environmentalist Bill McKibben's mantra that \"if it's wrong to wreck the climate, it's wrong to profit from that wreckage,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-case-for-fossil-fuel-divestment-20130222|title=The Case for Fossil-Fuel Divestment|newspaper=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref>\" [[fossil fuel divestment]] campaigns attempt to get public institutions, such as universities and churches, to remove investment assets from fossil fuel companies. By December 2016, a total of 688 institutions and over 58,000 individuals representing $5.5 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] in assets worldwide had been divested from fossil fuels.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://gofossilfree.org/commitments/|title=Commitments|newspaper=Fossil Free|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/12/fossil-fuel-divestment-funds-double-5tn-in-a-year|title=Fossil fuel divestment funds double to $5tn in a year|last=Carrington|first=Damian|date=2016-12-12|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref>

Groups such as [[NextGen America]] and [[Climate Hawks Vote]] are working in the [[United States]] to elect officials who will make action on climate change a high priority.
=== Climate disobedience ===
{{See also|Ende Gelände 2016|Ende Gelände 2017|Ende Gelände 2018|Ende Gelände 2019|Extinction Rebellion}}

Climate disobedience is a form of [[civil disobedience]], deliberate action intended to critique government climate policy. In 2008, American climate activist [[Tim DeChristopher]] posed as a bidder at an auction of US [[Bureau of Land Management]] oil and gas leases of public land in [[Utah]], won the auction, reneged on payment, and was imprisoned for 21 months. In September 2015, five climate activists known as the Delta 5 obstructed an oil train in [[Everett, Washington]]. At trial, the Delta 5 were allowed the [[necessity (criminal law)|necessity defense]], that is, breaking a law in the service of preventing a greater harm. After testimony, the judge determined the grounds for the necessity defense were not met and instructed the jury to disregard testimony admitted under the necessity defense. The Delta 5 were fined for trespassing but were acquitted of more serious charges.<ref>{{cite news |title=How to Stop an Oil Train: The Hearts-and-Minds Climate Defense That Won Over a Courtroom |magazine=[[Yes!

The first example of a judge accepting the climate necessity defense was on March 27, 2018 when Judge Mary Ann Driscoll acquitted all 13 defendants of civil charges from a protest held in 2016 in Boston, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marcum|first1=Marla|title=Exciting News from West Roxbury|url=http://www.climatedisobedience.org/exciting_news_from_west_roxbury|website=Climate Disobedience|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref>

== International political frameworks ==

=== Paris Agreement ===
[[File:Kyoto protocol parties and 2012-2020 commitments.svg|thumb|Map of countries participating in revised Kyoto Protocol and their commitments.]]
The [[Paris Agreement]] is an agreement within the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) dealing with [[Climate change mitigation|greenhouse gases emissions mitigation]], [[Climate change adaptation|adaptation]] and finance starting in the year 2020. The language of the agreement was negotiated by representatives of 195 countries at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC]] (COP21) in [[Paris]] and adopted by consensus on 12 December 2015.

The head of the Paris Conference, France's foreign minister [[Laurent Fabius]], called the plan \"ambitious and balanced\" and an \"historic turning point\" in the goal of reducing global warming. [[Paris Agreement#Concerns|Critics note]] that the agreement is not sufficient to achieve the 2&nbsp;°C warming target, and the lack of any binding enforcement mechanism. Subsequent Conference of the Parties meetings are expected to address shortcomings in the Paris Agreement.

Amid fierce opposition from scientists and other leaders around the world, U.S. President Donald Trump has [[Political positions of Donald Trump#Opposition to international cooperation on climate change|pledged to pull out of the Paris Agreement]].

[[Paris Agreement|The Paris Agreement]], which was brought to discussion on November 12, 2016, was made with a goal in mind to unite all countries against the threat of climate change. This argument stipulates that all countries involved contribute financially and regularly report on emissions and the status of national progress. At this point, over half the countries in Convention who were responsible for over half of greenhouse emissions, had ratified.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement|title=The Paris Agreement}}</ref>

=== The European Union  ===
[[File:Secretary Kerry and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon Address Reporters.jpg|thumb|Pictured above are US Secretary Kerry and the UN Secretary-General at the COP21 meeting of the UNFCCC in Paris.]]
Under the [[Kyoto Protocol]], countries with targets could elect to reach these targets in co-operation with other countries. The [[European Union]] has decided to work as a unit to meet its emissions targets. The European climate change program attempts to do this by utilising an emissions trading scheme known as the [[European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme]]. The principle of this scheme is quite simple: to make their legally binding commitments under Kyoto, countries can either make these savings within their own country, or they can buy these emissions reductions from other countries. These other countries would still need to meet their Kyoto targets, but the use of a [[free market]] system ensures the reductions are made for the least possible costs. Most reductions are made where these reductions are cheapest, and the excess reductions can be sold on to other countries where such cuts would be less economically viable. The EU ETS is arguably the global template for emissions trading schemes that are being implemented globally (China, South Korea, Tokyo and others).<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1142/S2345748114500031|title = Framing It Right: China–EU Relations and Patterns of Interaction on Climate Change|journal = Chinese Journal of Urban and Environmental Studies|volume = 02|pages = 1450003|year = 2014|last1 = Gippner|first1 = Olivia}}</ref>

The commitment of the [[European Union]] to cut back on its excessive green house gas emissions came from the implementation of the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. Since its application, the Doha amendments, which were made to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, have come to regulate this protocol and update the Union's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This second round of the Kyoto Protocol created a legally binding agreement for participating EU countries until 2020. Under this plan, by 2030, there are hopes of the EU cutting their emissions by 40%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/eu-conclude-ratification-second-kyoto-protocol-commitment-period-end-year_en|title=EU to conclude ratification for second Kyoto Protocol commitment period by end of this year}}</ref>

=== Contraction and Convergence ===
The concept of Cap, [[Contraction and Convergence]] was proposed as a replacement to the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto agreement]]. The idea here is that the limits to carbon emissions need to be capped at 350-450 parts per million, currently{{When|date=October 2019}} considered to produce a raise in world temperatures above pre-industrial levels of between 1 and 2 degrees Celsius. It is currently{{When|date=October 2019}} believed that further increases would bring about major positive feedbacks (the burning of forests and the loss of carbon from soils and oceans) which currently limit greenhouse gas emissions, and would lead to a run-away global warming similar to the [[Eocene]] period, during which there was no ice at the poles.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

To sustain this figure, it has been proposed that on equity grounds, all people should be allocated an equal carbon footprint (currently about 2 tonnes per person, which by 2050 could fall to 1.5 tonnes per person through population increase). World per capita carbon emissions, currently in excess of 4 tonnes per person needs to contract to those levels, if these targets are to be met.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carbonsense.com/|title=CarbonSense|website=CarbonSense}}</ref> As a result, in the name of global and inter-generational equity, policies needing to be instituted need to converge, over a fixed period towards this figure for every country. A trading regime, whereby which countries in excess of these figures (from example the [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States|US at 20 tonnes per capita]]), purchase [[carbon credit]]s from a country using less than its allocation (e.g. [[Kenya]] at 1.3 tonnes per capita), is considered by many as the best way of solving this problem.

For example, the Contract and Converge strategy was adopted by India, [[PRC|China]] and many African countries as the basis for future negotiations. The UK [[Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution]] said in 2000 \"the [[UK]] should be prepared to accept the contraction and convergence principle is the basis for international agreement on greenhouse gas emissions\".<ref>Meyer, Aubrey (2000), \"Contraction and Convergence:The Global Solution to Climate Change\" Schumacher Briefings 5, published by Green Books on behalf of the [[E. F. Schumacher|Schumacher]] Society</ref>

In 2015, the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] met in Paris to negotiate a new agreement. This meeting was the [[COP21|21st Conference of Parties]] (COP21). In this agreement, the goal was to keep temperatures under 1.5 degrees Celsius. While this goal was seen as progress in the fight against climate change, some more liable countries saw this as unattainable. They also thought some important steps were not taken during this meeting; however, everyone seemed optimistic for the future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-ir.info/2016/04/11/climate-change-and-international-relations/|title=Climate Change and International Relations|date=April 11, 2016}}</ref>

== Sub-national level action ==
Some states, regions, and cities in the world are taking the lead on developing emissions reduction methods in the absence of national policy, and may provide models for future national efforts. Their efforts are achieving real measurable emissions reductions and by pursuing policies and programs that have climate benefits, they have promoted state economic development, improved air quality and trimmed their vulnerability to energy price spikes. In the long run, addressing climate change will require comprehensive national policy and international agreements. However, in the US, due to absence of federal policy, states and regions are taking the lead on developing policies that may provide models for future national efforts.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite paper |author= Engel, Kirsten and Barak Orbach |title= Micro-Motives for State and Local Climate Change Initiatives |version= |publisher= [[Harvard Law & Policy Review]], Vol. 2, pp. 119-137 |year= 2008 |ssrn= 1014749 |format= }}</ref>

=== The Danish Council on Climate Change ===
In response to the [[Climate change in Denmark|Climate Change Act]], [[the Danish Council on Climate Change]] was formed in order to improve the quality of life through lessening the amount of carbon emitted in the [[atmosphere]]. This includes promoting cleaner future structures being built, clean [[renewable energy]], and transportation. A group of experts is working with the council in order to ensure that accurate data is being attained and more action is being made to see improvements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://klimaraadet.dk/en/about-danish-council-climate-change|title=About the Danish Council on Climate Change|date=2015-10-14|website=Klimarådet|language=en|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>

=== Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (United States) ===
The [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] (RGGI, pronounced \"Reggie\") is the first mandatory market based program in the United States to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. RGGI is a cooperative effort among the states of [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]] to cap and reduce {{CO2}} emissions from the power sector. In effect since January 1, 2009, the program is now in its third 3-year compliance period (2015-2017). As of 2016, RGGI has cut power plant carbon emissions in the region by 37%, while saving customers over $395 million on their bills.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrdc.org/experts/jackson-morris/pioneering-carbon-cutting-program-turns-10-what-now-rggi|title=Pioneering Carbon-Cutting Program Turns 10: What Now, RGGI?|newspaper=NRDC|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref>

=== Ghent, Belgium ===
The city promotes a meat-free day on Thursdays called Veggiedag,<ref>[http://www.vegetarisme.be/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=767 \"Ghent's veggie day: for English speaking visitors\"] on Vegetarisme.be</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8046970.stm \"Belgian city plans 'veggie' days\"] on [[BBC News]] (2009-05-12).</ref> with [[vegetarian]]-only food in public canteens for civil servants and elected councillors, soon in all schools, and promotion of vegetarian eating options in town (through the distribution of \"veggie street maps\"). This campaign is linked to the recognition of the [[Environmental effects of meat production#Fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions|detrimental environmental effects of meat production]], which the [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] has established to represent nearly one-fifth of global [[greenhouse gas emissions]].

=== United Kingdom ===
The town of [[Totnes]] in Devon through its \"Transition Town Totnes\" Project has adopted an Energy Descent Plan, as a response in answer to the twin problems of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and [[peak oil]]. As a result of a series of large, well attended public gatherings with key experts from around the world, and the organisation of a number of special interest groups, the community has come together with lecturers and trainers shared with [[Schumacher College]], through a process of participative strategic planning, to hone their skills in project development. As a result of the initiatives in Totnes, a large number of other communities have started \"[[Transition Towns|Transition Town]]\" projects, and there are now more than 400 around the world,<ref name=\"Transition Initiatives Directory\">{{cite web|title=Transition Initiatives Directory|url=http://www.transitionnetwork.org/initiatives|accessdate=30 Dec 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105164933/http://www.transitionnetwork.org/initiatives|archive-date=5 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> ranging from small communities to whole cities (e.g. [[Berlin]]).

The concepts of including [[food miles]] or carbon neutral labels on packaging has been gaining interest in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10000217|title=Taking a Practical Approach to 'Green' Living|website=NPR.org}}</ref>

== Individual action ==
{{main|Individual action on climate change}}
Studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals have posited that the most significant way for individuals to reduce their own ecological footprint is '''to have fewer children''', followed by traveling without a vehicle, forgoing air travel and adopting a largely plant-based diet.<ref>{{cite news |last=  Perkins|first=Sid|date=July 11, 2017|title=The best way to reduce your carbon footprint is one the government isn't telling you about|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/best-way-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-one-government-isn-t-telling-you-about|work=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |location= |access-date=March 24, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Ripple|first=William J.|display-authors=etal.|title=World Scientists' Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice|date=13 November 2017|volume=67|pages=1026–1028|number=12|journal=[[BioScience]]|url=http://scientistswarning.forestry.oregonstate.edu/sites/sw/files/Warning_article_with_supp_11-13-17.pdf|doi=10.1093/biosci/bix125|authorlink=William J. Ripple|quote=It is also time to re-examine and change our individual behaviors, including limiting our own reproduction (ideally to replacement level at most) and drastically diminishing our per capita consumption of fossil fuels, meat, and other resources.}}</ref>

=== Carbon Conversations ===
The Carbon Conversations is a [[psychosocial]] project that focuses on the [[Moral agency|agency]] of individuals to encourage personal action to reduce carbon emissions. The project touches on five main topics: i) home energy; ii) food; iii) travel; iv) consumption and waste; and v) talking with family and friends. The project understands that individuals often fail to adopt low-carbon lifestyles not because of practical barriers to change (e.g.: there is no renewable energy available), but because of aspects related to their values, emotions, and identity. The project offers a supportive group experience that helps people reduce their personal carbon dioxide emissions by 1 tonne {{CO2}} on average and aim at halving it in the long term. They deal with the difficulties of change by connecting to values, emotions and identity. The groups are based on a [[psychosocial]] understanding of how people change. Groups of 6-8 members meet six or twelve times with trained facilitators in homes, community centres, workplaces or other venues. The meetings create a non-judgmental atmosphere where people are encouraged to make serious lifestyle changes.

Carbon Conversations was cited in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper as one of the 20 best ideas to tackle climate change.<ref>Katz, Ian (2009). [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/13/manchester-report-climate-change Twenty Ideas That Could Save the World]</ref>

=== Energy Usage ===
On the global scale, the utilization of energy speaks to a wide margin of people. The biggest wellspring of [[greenhouse gas emissions]] are from human activities. Around 66% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions are connected to consuming fossil fuels for energy to utilize for warming, power, transport and industry. In Europe, as well, energy processes are the biggest producer of
greenhouse gases, 78% of total EU emissions in 2015.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Energy and climate change|url=https://www.eea.europa.eu/signals/signals-2017/articles/energy-and-climate-change|language=en}}</ref>

=== Consumers and diet ===
The 2019 [[World Scientists' Warning to Humanity#2019 warning on the climate change|World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency]], endorsed by over 11,000 scientists from more than 150 countries, stated that \"eating mostly plant-based foods while reducing the global consumption of animal products, especially ruminant livestock, can improve human health and significantly lower GHG emissions.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Ripple |first1=William J.|last2=Wolf|first2=Christopher |last3= Newsome |first3=Thomas M |last4=Barnard |first4= Phoebe  |last5= Moomaw |first5=William R |date=November 5, 2019 |title=World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency |url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biz088/5610806 |journal=[[BioScience]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1093/biosci/biz088}}</ref>

''Sonny with a Chance'' was the first [[Disney Channel Original Series]] to be shot and aired in [[High-definition television|high-definition]] from the beginning. Like most of [[Disney Channel]]'s sitcoms, it is shot on tape but uses a \"[[filmizing|filmized]]\" appearance. In the second season, some scenes were shot on location. The series is one of the three Disney Channel Original Series to feature a [[show-within-a-show]], along with ''[[The Famous Jett Jackson]]'' and ''[[Shake It Up (U.S. TV series)|Shake It Up]]''. 

''Sonny with a Chance'' was renewed for a second season in June 2009,<ref name=\"sonnysecondseason\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Hannah-Sonny-Renewed-1006493.aspx|title=Disney Channel Renews Hannah with a Change, Sonny with a Chance|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|date=June 1, 2009|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}</ref> which premiered in March 2010 to 6.3 million viewers. Disney Channel had originally renewed the series for a third season in November 2010, but Lovato's role was an uncertainty at the time after she checked into treatment for personal struggles two weeks prior. Production of the third season commenced without Lovato in January 2011, focusing on the ''So Random!'' aspect rather than behind the scenes. In April 2011, Disney Channel confirmed that Lovato would not be returning to the series' lead role and ''Sonny with a Chance'' would not return,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://perezhilton.com/2011-03-04-demi-lovato-sonny-with-a-chance-changes-name-to-so-random |title=Demi Lovato's Sonny With A Chance Gets Name Change |publisher=[[PerezHilton.com]] |date=2011-04-03 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2011/04/19/why-demi-lovato-leaving-disney-sonny-with-a-chance/ |title=Demi Lovato leaving Sonny with a Chance |publisher=hollywoodlife.com |date=April 19, 2011 |accessdate=July 10, 2015}}</ref> choosing instead to rebrand the already-renewed third season as a spin-off titled ''[[So Random!]]''. The spin-off aired for a single season before being cancelled.

The show became available to stream on [[Disney+]] on April 3, 2020 along with the first season of ''So Random!''. Disney branded ''So Random!'' as a third season of ''Sonny with a Chance'' on Disney+ rather than a separate show.<ref>{{Disney+ series|id=5ATBxoqJNWLB|title=Sonny with a Chance}}</ref>

*: Sonny is a friendly, eccentric and well-intentioned teenage girl from [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]], [[Wisconsin]] who lands a main role on her favorite comedy sketch television show, ''[[So Random!]].'' She is a rising star of the ensemble cast and works hard to be the best comedian she can be. Sonny often tries to solve the ongoing feud between the ''Mackenzie Falls'' and ''So Random!'' casts, especially when she dates the star of \"Mackenzie Falls,\" Chad Dylan Cooper. She was Chad's girlfriend as of the episode \"Falling for the Falls\" until they split in \"Sonny with a Choice\". As seen in further episodes, all of her co-stars are very fond of her. She does not appear in ''[[So Random!]]'', due to Lovato's departure.
* [[Tiffany Thornton]] as Tawni Hart
*: Tawni is a main cast member of \"So Random!\" who is jealous of Sonny. She originally feared Sonny was moving in on her spotlight and acted meanly towards the newcomer. However, after a while, the two become best friends. Tawni is a [[diva]]; she loves mirrors, make-up and everything about herself. She is self-centered, but also talented and has a soft side. She has a similar personality to Chad. She prefers to wear \"Coco Mocho Coco\" lipstick, as stated in many episodes.
* [[Sterling Knight]] as Chad Dylan Cooper
*: Chad is a teen heartthrob as the star on ''Mackenzie Falls'', the rival teen TV series of ''So Random!''. He is stubborn, egotistical, pampered, and self-centered, but he has a soft side, which he usually only shows to Sonny. He and Sonny had a love-hate relationship until the 2nd season when he was Sonny's boyfriend as of the episode \"Falling for the Falls\" until they split in \"Sonny with a Choice.\" As a result of this romance, he started to warm up to the ''So Random!'' cast and eventually started to \"hang out\" with them. It is shown that he still has feelings for Sonny in the episode after they split. In the first season, he was seen as a stubborn, vain young man, but in later episodes, he has changed to be more loving and kind. Throughout season 1 he displays feelings for Sonny. For example, in the episode \"Sonny with a Chance of Dating\" Chad was jealous when he found out Sonny was going on a date with James. In addition, in the same episode, when Chad and Sonny were fake dating, Chad said to put her head on his shoulder hinting that he likes her. In the episode, \"You've got Fan Mail\", Sonny seems touched that Chad actually cared enough to dress up as Eric for her. Chad tries to cover it up by saying he just wanted to try on the beard that went along with the Eric costume. Again, in episode 16 of the first season, \"Sonny in the Kitchen with Dinner\", Chad becomes jealous when he sees the news on a magazine about Sonny kissing Hayden because of the kiss cam.
* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as Nico Harris
*: Nico is a cast member of ''So Random!'' who is best friends with Grady. He is always striking out with the girls and has a crush on ''Mackenzie Falls'' star Penelope, who constantly turns him down when he asks her out. A running gag throughout the series is Nico jumping into Grady's arms when he gets scared. He is said to have been discovered in a one-man band.
* [[Doug Brochu]] as Grady Mitchell
*: Grady is a cast member of ''So Random!''. He is best friends with Nico who often calls him \"G\". Grady is always involved in strange plans with Nico. He is shown to be dull-witted, gullible and immature. He also comes up with very strange conclusions to certain situations. He loves to eat and hates exercising. He claims to be an expert lip-reader, but very often misreads his targets' mouths and comes up with non-sensical sentences. In the episode \"The New Girl\" he tells Nico that when he's around a girl that he believes likes him, he will turn into a Scotsman named Seamus McGregor. He has a big brother named Grant who is in college and is the leader of his own fraternity.
* [[Allisyn Ashley Arm]] as Zora Lancaster
*: Zora is the youngest cast member of ''So Random!''. She is very smart, mysterious, crazy and clever. She is the most cunning of the 'So Random!' cast and is known as \"the weird one\". She often pops out of nowhere, surprising her friends. She is somewhat a detective and puts her skills to use in the \"So Random\" studio. She listens in on her friends' conversations and then shocks them by speaking to them about it later on. She appeared sporadically throughout the second season.

==Production==
The original working title for the series was ''Sketchpad!'', and the original name for the main character was Molly Munroe. The show's title was later changed to ''Welcome to Mollywood''. After the first publicity materials about the show were released, the lead character's name was then changed to Holli and the title changed once again to ''Welcome to Holliwood''. The main character's name was later changed to Sonny Munroe, and the show's title was changed for a final time to ''Sonny with a Chance''. The name is a play on the words \"Sunny with a chance of rain\", as heard in weather forecasts, reflecting the many comical situations in which the cast find themselves in each episode. Originally Lovato auditioned with [[Bridgit Mendler]] for the role, but Lovato was chosen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/lemonade-mouth-star-bridgit-mendler-8322669.html?cat=40|title=Lemonade Mouth Star: Bridgit Mendler|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=December 14, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925105138/http://voices.yahoo.com/lemonade-mouth-star-bridgit-mendler-8322669.html?cat=40|archivedate=September 25, 2013}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}

This was spun-off to its own series after Lovato's departure.<ref name=\"omg.yahoo.com\" />

The enemies of the ''So Random!'' group, ''Mackenzie Falls'' is a [[tween (demographic)|tween]] [[drama series]] featuring comedic overacting. The show is similar to ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', among others. The show's name, ''Mackenzie Falls'', comes from Chad's character's name and the name of the town (which is located near a [[waterfall]]). In the season two episode \"The Legend of Candy Face\", the cast of ''So Random!'' made a parody of ''Mackenzie Falls'' titled ''Mackenzie [[Public toilet|Stalls]]'', which was set in a [[bathroom]]. Minisodes and promos can be seen on the ''Sonny with a Chance'' website along with one minisode as a bonus feature on the DVD.

==Theme song and opening sequence==
The show's theme song \"So Far, So Great\", was written and produced by Jeanne Lurie, Chen Neeman and Aristedis \"Aris\" Archontis, who have each written songs for several artists on Disney-owned [[Hollywood Records]]. It is performed by series actress Demi Lovato. The theme is of pop-rock style (the music cues composed by Chris Alan Lee and Scott Clausen, signaling scene changes and commercial breaks are styled similarly).

A full-length version of this theme was released via the [[Radio Disney]] network on March 31, 2009, less than two months after the show's U.S. premiere. The theme song is also featured as a track on the Disney compilation album, ''[[Disney Channel Playlist]]'', released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on June 9, 2009. The song is also available as the bonus track on Lovato's second album ''[[Here We Go Again (Demi Lovato album)|Here We Go Again]]'', released by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 21, 2009.

In the [[Russian language|Russian]] version of the series (\"Дайте Санни шанс\" aka Give Sonny a Chance), the cast members' names are rendered in [[Cyrillic]]—and the intro is performed by a different Russian girl in Russian (not by Demi Lovato).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7TJ50fSJrE |title=Sonny With a Chance Russian opening (season 2) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> Otherwise, in translation the intro music is not changed.

In the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] version (\"Sunny Entre Estrelas\"), the intro music is sung in translation.

===Demi Lovato's departure and ''So Random!''===
It was announced on November 12, 2010 that the third season would begin production without Lovato, due to her recovering from health issues. Instead, the series focused on the sketch/comedy/music-variety show ''So Random!'', centering on guest stars, sketches, digital shorts, and musical performances, a similar format to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', but targeted at a much younger audience.<ref name=\"sorandomrework\"/><ref name=\"omg.yahoo.com\">[https://tv.yahoo.com/news/article/tv.tvguide.com/tv.tvguide.com-disney-channel-revamp-demi-lovato-series Disney Channel to Revamp Demi Lovato Series] Yahoo!.com</ref> Production of the third season began on January 30, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |work=Hollywood Life |url=http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2011/01/07/demi-lovato-released-from-rehab-treatment-shooting-sonny-with-a-chance-official-date/ |title=We Know The Official Start Date For 'Sonny With A Chance' — Will Demi Make It Out In Time? Exclusive! |first=Jessica |last=Finn |date=January 7, 2011 |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]] |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/459436-Disney_Channels_Ramp_Up_Series_Episodes_By_30_Percent.php |title=Disney Channels Ramp Up Series Episodes By 30 Percent |first=Melissa |last=Grego |date=November 4, 2010 |accessdate=November 5, 2010}}</ref>

On April 19, 2011, People.com reported that Demi Lovato would not be returning for the third season.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20483103,00.html?xid=rss-topheadlines Demi Lovato Is Leaving Sonny with a Chance] – People.com</ref> As a result, the show was renamed ''So Random!'' and focused on the sketches rather than the behind-the-scenes antics. As a result of Lovato's departure from ''Sonny with a Chance'', the series became the second Disney Channel original series to have its lead actor/actress leave during the series' run (after ''[[So Weird]]''), and the fourth Disney Channel series to have a main cast member leave the series during its run (with ''[[That's So Raven]]'' and ''[[Jonas (TV series)|Jonas]]'' also included).<ref>[http://www.tvline.com/2011/04/demi-lovato-exits-sonny-with-a-chance/ Demi Lovato Exits Disney Series: 'I Don't Think It Would Be Healthy for My Recovery'] – TVLine.com</ref>

The third season was then turned into its own [[So Random!|new series]] based on the new format.

''Sonny with a Chance'' was the first [[Disney Channel Original Series]] to be shot and aired in [[High-definition television|high-definition]] from the beginning. Like most of [[Disney Channel]]'s sitcoms, it is shot on tape but uses a \"[[filmizing|filmized]]\" appearance. In the second season, some scenes were shot on location. The series is one of the three Disney Channel Original Series to feature a [[show-within-a-show]], along with ''[[The Famous Jett Jackson]]'' and ''[[Shake It Up (U.S. TV series)|Shake It Up]]''. 

''Sonny with a Chance'' was renewed for a second season in June 2009,<ref name=\"sonnysecondseason\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Hannah-Sonny-Renewed-1006493.aspx|title=Disney Channel Renews Hannah with a Change, Sonny with a Chance|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|date=June 1, 2009|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}</ref> which premiered in March 2010 to 6.3 million viewers. Disney Channel had originally renewed the series for a third season in November 2010, but Lovato's role was an uncertainty at the time after she checked into treatment for personal struggles two weeks prior. Production of the third season commenced without Lovato in January 2011, focusing on the ''So Random!'' aspect rather than behind the scenes. In April 2011, Disney Channel confirmed that Lovato would not be returning to the series' lead role and ''Sonny with a Chance'' would not return,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://perezhilton.com/2011-03-04-demi-lovato-sonny-with-a-chance-changes-name-to-so-random |title=Demi Lovato's Sonny With A Chance Gets Name Change |publisher=[[PerezHilton.com]] |date=2011-04-03 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2011/04/19/why-demi-lovato-leaving-disney-sonny-with-a-chance/ |title=Demi Lovato leaving Sonny with a Chance |publisher=hollywoodlife.com |date=April 19, 2011 |accessdate=July 10, 2015}}</ref> choosing instead to rebrand the already-filmed third season as a spin-off titled ''[[So Random!]]''. The spin-off aired for a single season before being cancelled.

The show became available to stream on [[Disney+]] on April 3, 2020 along with the first season of ''So Random!''. Disney branded ''So Random!'' as a third season of ''Sonny with a Chance'' on Disney+ rather than a separate show.<ref>{{Disney+ series|id=5ATBxoqJNWLB|title=Sonny with a Chance}}</ref>

*: Sonny is a friendly, eccentric and well-intentioned teenage girl from [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]], [[Wisconsin]] who lands a main role on her favorite comedy sketch television show, ''[[So Random!]].'' She is a rising star of the ensemble cast and works hard to be the best comedian she can be. Sonny often tries to solve the ongoing feud between the ''Mackenzie Falls'' and ''So Random!'' casts, especially when she dates the star of \"Mackenzie Falls,\" Chad Dylan Cooper. She was Chad's girlfriend as of the episode \"Falling for the Falls\" until they split in \"Sonny with a Choice\". As seen in further episodes, all of her co-stars are very fond of her. She does not appear in ''[[So Random!]]'', due to Lovato's departure.
* [[Tiffany Thornton]] as Tawni Hart
*: Tawni is a main cast member of \"So Random!\" who is jealous of Sonny. She originally feared Sonny was moving in on her spotlight and acted meanly towards the newcomer. However, after a while, the two become best friends. Tawni is a [[diva]]; she loves mirrors, make-up and everything about herself. She is self-centered, but also talented and has a soft side. She has a similar personality to Chad. She prefers to wear \"Coco Mocho Coco\" lipstick, as stated in many episodes.
* [[Sterling Knight]] as Chad Dylan Cooper
*: Chad is a teen heartthrob as the star on ''Mackenzie Falls'', the rival teen TV series of ''So Random!''. He is stubborn, egotistical, pampered, and self-centered, but he has a soft side, which he usually only shows to Sonny. He and Sonny had a love-hate relationship until the 2nd season when he was Sonny's boyfriend as of the episode \"Falling for the Falls\" until they split in \"Sonny with a Choice.\" As a result of this romance, he started to warm up to the ''So Random!'' cast and eventually started to \"hang out\" with them. It is shown that he still has feelings for Sonny in the episode after they split. In the first season, he was seen as a stubborn, vain young man, but in later episodes, he has changed to be more loving and kind. Throughout season 1 he displays feelings for Sonny. For example, in the episode \"Sonny with a Chance of Dating\" Chad was jealous when he found out Sonny was going on a date with James. In addition, in the same episode, when Chad and Sonny were fake dating, Chad said to put her head on his shoulder hinting that he likes her. In the episode, \"You've got Fan Mail\", Sonny seems touched that Chad actually cared enough to dress up as Eric for her. Chad tries to cover it up by saying he just wanted to try on the beard that went along with the Eric costume. Again, in episode 16 of the first season, \"Sonny in the Kitchen with Dinner\", Chad becomes jealous when he sees the news on a magazine about Sonny kissing Hayden because of the kiss cam.
* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as Nico Harris
*: Nico is a cast member of ''So Random!'' who is best friends with Grady. He is always striking out with the girls and has a crush on ''Mackenzie Falls'' star Penelope, who constantly turns him down when he asks her out. A running gag throughout the series is Nico jumping into Grady's arms when he gets scared. He is said to have been discovered in a one-man band.
* [[Doug Brochu]] as Grady Mitchell
*: Grady is a cast member of ''So Random!''. He is best friends with Nico who often calls him \"G\". Grady is always involved in strange plans with Nico. He is shown to be dull-witted, gullible and immature. He also comes up with very strange conclusions to certain situations. He loves to eat and hates exercising. He claims to be an expert lip-reader, but very often misreads his targets' mouths and comes up with non-sensical sentences. In the episode \"The New Girl\" he tells Nico that when he's around a girl that he believes likes him, he will turn into a Scotsman named Seamus McGregor. He has a big brother named Grant who is in college and is the leader of his own fraternity.
* [[Allisyn Ashley Arm]] as Zora Lancaster
*: Zora is the youngest cast member of ''So Random!''. She is very smart, mysterious, crazy and clever. She is the most cunning of the 'So Random!' cast and is known as \"the weird one\". She often pops out of nowhere, surprising her friends. She is somewhat a detective and puts her skills to use in the \"So Random\" studio. She listens in on her friends' conversations and then shocks them by speaking to them about it later on. She appeared sporadically throughout the second season.

==Production==
The original working title for the series was ''Sketchpad!'', and the original name for the main character was Molly Munroe. The show's title was later changed to ''Welcome to Mollywood''. After the first publicity materials about the show were released, the lead character's name was then changed to Holli and the title changed once again to ''Welcome to Holliwood''. The main character's name was later changed to Sonny Munroe, and the show's title was changed for a final time to ''Sonny with a Chance''. The name is a play on the words \"Sunny with a chance of rain\", as heard in weather forecasts, reflecting the many comical situations in which the cast find themselves in each episode. Originally Lovato auditioned with [[Bridgit Mendler]] for the role, but Lovato was chosen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/lemonade-mouth-star-bridgit-mendler-8322669.html?cat=40|title=Lemonade Mouth Star: Bridgit Mendler|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=December 14, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925105138/http://voices.yahoo.com/lemonade-mouth-star-bridgit-mendler-8322669.html?cat=40|archivedate=September 25, 2013}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}

==Shows within the show==

===''So Random!''===
<!-- This section is about the show in Sonny with a Chance, not the separate \"So Random!\" program that replaced it. -->
''So Random!'' is a [[Sketch comedy|comedy sketch series]] that employs most of the main cast. It often causes the cast of ''Sonny with a Chance'' to dress in ridiculous costumes, and act out nonsensical situations. This was spun-off to its own series after Lovato's departure.<ref name=\"omg.yahoo.com\" />

===''Mackenzie Falls''===
The enemies of the ''So Random!'' group, ''Mackenzie Falls'' is a [[tween (demographic)|tween]] [[drama series]] featuring comedic overacting. The show is similar to ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', among others. The show's name, ''Mackenzie Falls'', comes from Chad's character's name and the name of the town (which is located near a [[waterfall]]). In the season two episode \"The Legend of Candy Face\", the cast of ''So Random!'' made a parody of ''Mackenzie Falls'' titled ''Mackenzie [[Public toilet|Stalls]]'', which was set in a [[bathroom]]. Minisodes and promos can be seen on the ''Sonny with a Chance'' website along with one minisode as a bonus feature on the DVD.

==Theme song and opening sequence==
The show's theme song \"So Far, So Great\", was written and produced by Jeanne Lurie, Chen Neeman and Aristedis \"Aris\" Archontis, who have each written songs for several artists on Disney-owned [[Hollywood Records]]. It is performed by series actress Demi Lovato. The theme is of pop-rock style (the music cues composed by Chris Alan Lee and Scott Clausen, signaling scene changes and commercial breaks are styled similarly).

A full-length version of this theme was released via the [[Radio Disney]] network on March 31, 2009, less than two months after the show's U.S. premiere. The theme song is also featured as a track on the Disney compilation album, ''[[Disney Channel Playlist]]'', released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on June 9, 2009. The song is also available as the bonus track on Lovato's second album ''[[Here We Go Again (Demi Lovato album)|Here We Go Again]]'', released by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 21, 2009.

In the [[Russian language|Russian]] version of the series (\"Дайте Санни шанс\" aka Give Sonny a Chance), the cast members' names are rendered in [[Cyrillic]]—and the intro is performed by a different Russian girl in Russian (not by Demi Lovato).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7TJ50fSJrE |title=Sonny With a Chance Russian opening (season 2) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> Otherwise, in translation the intro music is not changed.

In the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] version (\"Sunny Entre Estrelas\"), the intro music is sung in translation.

===Demi Lovato's departure and ''So Random!''===
It was announced on November 12, 2010 that the third season would begin production without Lovato, due to her recovering from health issues. Instead, the series focused on the sketch/comedy/music-variety show ''So Random!'', centering on guest stars, sketches, digital shorts, and musical performances, a similar format to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', but targeted at a much younger audience.<ref name=\"sorandomrework\"/><ref name=\"omg.yahoo.com\">[https://tv.yahoo.com/news/article/tv.tvguide.com/tv.tvguide.com-disney-channel-revamp-demi-lovato-series Disney Channel to Revamp Demi Lovato Series] Yahoo!.com</ref> Production of the third season began on January 30, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |work=Hollywood Life |url=http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2011/01/07/demi-lovato-released-from-rehab-treatment-shooting-sonny-with-a-chance-official-date/ |title=We Know The Official Start Date For 'Sonny With A Chance' — Will Demi Make It Out In Time?

On April 19, 2011, People.com reported that Demi Lovato would not be returning for the third season.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20483103,00.html?xid=rss-topheadlines Demi Lovato Is Leaving Sonny with a Chance] – People.com</ref> As a result, the show was renamed ''So Random!'' and focused on the sketches rather than the behind-the-scenes antics. As a result of Lovato's departure from ''Sonny with a Chance'', the series became the second Disney Channel original series to have its lead actor/actress leave during the series' run (after ''[[So Weird]]''), and the fourth Disney Channel series to have a main cast member leave the series during its run (with ''[[That's So Raven]]'' and ''[[Jonas (TV series)|Jonas]]'' also included).<ref>[http://www.tvline.com/2011/04/demi-lovato-exits-sonny-with-a-chance/ Demi Lovato Exits Disney Series: 'I Don't Think It Would Be Healthy for My Recovery'] – TVLine.com</ref>

The third season was then turned into its own [[So Random!|new series]] based on the new format.

''High Expectations'' received generally positive reviews from music critics. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalised]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 61, based on 10 reviews.<ref name=\"MC\"/> Reviewing the album for ''[[musicOMH]]'', Ben Devlin hailed it as \"a convincing display of versatility and quality songwriting that firmly establishes Mabel as a force to be reckoned with in UK pop\",<ref name=\"musicOMH\"/> while Chris Taylor of ''[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]]'' regarded it as \"effortlessly cool\" with \"no faux-earnestness\".<ref name=\"DIY\"/> ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine's Laura Barton called the album \"highly polished\" and said the singer \"perfected the art of writing songs that even on first listen sound totally ubiquitous\".<ref name=\"Q magazine\"/> In ''[[NME]]'', Hannah Mylrea wrote that Mabel's \"gorgeous silky vocals soar, the glossy production is stellar, but the exuberance and effervescent attitude that make tunes like 'Don't Call Me Up' so brilliant aren't found throughout.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/>

Andrew Wright of ''[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]'' argued that the singer found her individual identity with ''High Expectations'' which he described as well-rounded despite \"some over-zealous Top 40 attempts\".<ref name=\"Skinny\"/> Conversely, Joe Hale of ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' found it \"almost too airbrushed, with Mabel playing it a little too safe to qualify being described as wholly original or progressive\", but concluded that it had \"some real highlights\" and \"moments of talent and flair\".<ref name=\"Clash\"/> Despite finding the album strong and well-crafted, ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s [[Alexis Petridis]] also believed it lacked personality and only \"occasionally hints its maker might be more interesting and individual\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> [[Kitty Empire]] was more critical in ''[[The Observer]]'', writing, \"''High Expectations'' is just disappointingly all right, lacking any playfulness, or top spin, or a sense of who Mabel is,\"<ref name=\"The Observer\"/> while ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' critic Johnny Sharp commented, \"Despite some pleasant enough tunes, she lacks the vocal charisma to stand out from other wannabe [[Rihanna]]<nowiki/>s, [[Miley Cyrus|Miley]]<nowiki/>s and [[Dua Lipa]]<nowiki/>s.\"<ref name=\"Uncut\"/> Mick Jacobs of ''[[PopMatters]]'' concluded, \"Though sung in a beautiful, agile voice, the album's contents lack any innovation that truly set them apart, even amongst themselves.\"<ref name=\"PopMatters\"/>

''High Expectations'' received generally positive reviews from music critics. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalised]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 61, based on 10 reviews.<ref name=\"MC\"/> Reviewing the album for ''[[musicOMH]]'', Ben Devlin hailed it as \"a convincing display of versatility and quality songwriting that firmly establishes Mabel as a force to be reckoned with in UK pop\",<ref name=\"musicOMH\"/> while Chris Taylor of ''[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]]'' regarded it as \"effortlessly cool\" with \"no faux-earnestness\".<ref name=\"DIY\"/> ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine's Laura Barton called the album \"highly polished\" and said the singer \"perfected the art of writing songs that even on first listen sound totally ubiquitous\".<ref name=\"Q magazine\"/> In ''[[NME]]'', Hannah Mylrea wrote that Mabel's \"gorgeous silky vocals soar, the glossy production is stellar, but the exuberance and effervescent attitude that make tunes like 'Don't Call Me Up' so brilliant aren't found throughout.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/>

Andrew Wright of ''[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]'' argued that the singer found her individual identity with ''High Expectations'' which he described as well-rounded despite \"some over-zealous Top 40 attempts\".<ref name=\"Skinny\"/> Conversely, Joe Hale of ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' found it \"almost too airbrushed, with Mabel playing it a little too safe to qualify being described as wholly original or progressive\", but concluded that it had \"some real highlights\" and \"moments of talent and flair\".<ref name=\"Clash\"/> Despite finding the album strong and well-crafted, ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s [[Alexis Petridis]] also believed it lacked personality and only \"occasionally hints its maker might be more interesting and individual\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> [[Kitty Empire]] was more critical in ''[[The Observer]]'', writing, \"''High Expectations'' is just disappointingly all right, lacking any playfulness, or top spin, or a sense of who Mabel is,\"<ref name=\"The Observer\"/> while ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' critic Johnny Sharp commented, \"Despite some pleasant enough tunes, she lacks the vocal charisma to stand out from other wannabe [[Rihanna]]<nowiki/>s, [[Miley Cyrus|Miley]]<nowiki/>s and [[Dua Lipa]]<nowiki/>s.\"<ref name=\"Uncut\"/> Mick Jacobs of ''[[PopMatters]]'' concluded, \"Though sung in a beautiful, agile voice, the album's contents lack any innovation that truly set them apart, even amongst themselves.\"<ref name=\"PopMatters\"/>

'''Brentwood''' is a town in the [[Brentwood (borough)|Borough of Brentwood]], in the county of [[Essex]] in the [[East of England]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=43 |title=Brentwood Borough Council |publisher=Brentwood-council.gov.uk |accessdate=20 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314060920/http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=43 |archivedate=14 March 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> It is in the [[London commuter belt]], 20 miles (30&nbsp;km) east-north-east of [[Charing Cross]], and near the [[M25 motorway]]. As of 2017, the population of the town is estimated to be 54,885.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/eastofengland/ |title = East of England (United Kingdom): Counties and Unitary Districts & Settlements - Population Statistics, Charts and Map}}</ref>

Brentwood is a suburban town with a small but expanding<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/brentwood_local_plan/chapter5.html |title=Brentwood Replacement Local Plan |publisher=Brentwood-council.gov.uk |accessdate=20 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709002057/http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/brentwood_local_plan/chapter5.html |archivedate=9 July 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> shopping area and high street. Beyond this are residential developments surrounded by open countryside and woodland; some of this countryside lies within only a few hundred yards of the town centre.

Brentwood has been [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] since 1978 with [[Roth, Bavaria|Roth]], Germany and since 1994 with [[Montbazon]], France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwood.gov.uk/index.php?cid=2356 |title=Town Twinning |publisher=Brentwood Borough Council |accessdate=15 March 2014}}</ref> It also has a relationship with [[Brentwood, Tennessee]] in the United States.

==History==

===Etymology===
The name was assumed by some in the 1700s to derive from a corruption of the words 'burnt' and 'wood', with the name Burntwood still visible on some 18th-century maps. However, ''[[Brent (name)|brent]]'' was the middle English for \"burnt\". The name describes the presumed reason for settlement in the part of the Forest of Essex (later [[Epping Forest]]) that would have covered the area, where a major occupation was charcoal burning.

===Early history===
Although a [[Bronze Age]] axe has been found in Brentwood and there are clear signs of an entrenched encampment in [[Weald Country Park]], it is considered unlikely that there was any significant early settlement of the area. At the time, most of Essex was covered by the [[Epping Forest|Great Forest]]. It is believed that despite the Roman road between [[London]] and [[Colchester]] passing through the town, the [[Saxons]] were the earliest settlers of the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=52 |title=Foundation of the Town |publisher=Brentwood-council.gov.uk |accessdate=20 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122133853/http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=52 |archivedate=22 January 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref>

The borough was on a crossroads, where the Roman road from [[Colchester]] to London crossed the route the pilgrims took over the [[River Thames]] to Canterbury. A chapel was built in or around 1221, and in 1227 a market charter was granted. Its growth may have been stimulated by the cult of St. Thomas the Martyr, to whom the chapel was dedicated: the 12th-century ruin of [[Thomas Becket]] Chapel was a popular stopping point for pilgrims on their way to Canterbury. The ruin stands in the centre of the high street and the nearby parish church of Brentwood retains the dedication to St. Thomas of Canterbury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-thomas.org.uk|title=Anglican Parish of St Thomas of Canterbury|publisher=St-thomas.org.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> [[Pilgrims Hatch]], or 'Pilgrims' gate', was probably named from pilgrims who crossed through on their way to the chapel. It is likely, however, that Brentwood's development was due chiefly to its main road position, its market, and its convenient location as an administrative centre. Early industries were connected mainly with textile and garment making, brewing, and brickmaking.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63844&strquery=brentwood%20martyr|title=British History Online : Brentwood|publisher=British-history.ac.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>

During the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, Brentwood was the meeting place for some of the instigators, such as [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]]. They apparently met regularly in local pubs and inns. The first event of the Peasants' Revolt occurred in Brentwood, when men from Fobbing, Corringham and Stanford were summoned by the commissioner Thomas Bampton to Brentwood to answer as to who had avoided paying the poll tax.  Bampton insisted that the peasants pay what was demanded of them. The peasants refused to pay and a riot ensued as Bampton attempted to arrest the peasants. The peasants moved to kill Bampton, but he managed to escape to London. The rioters then, fearing the repercussions of what they had done, fled into the forest. After the riot the peasants sent word to the rest of the country and initiated the Peasants' Revolt.<ref>Dedman, M., 2012. Peasants were revolting - and they did it right here. ''Brentwood Gazette'', 6 Jun p. 20.</ref> The Essex [[assizes]] were sometimes held here, as well as at [[Chelmsford]]. One such pub was ''The White Hart''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/54568|title=The White Hart, Brentwood High Street (C) John Winfield :: Geograph Britain and Ireland|publisher=Geograph.org.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> (now a nightclub called ''[[Sugar Hut]] Village'' and showing little of its original historic interest), which is one of the oldest buildings in Brentwood; it is believed to have been built in 1480 although apocryphal evidence suggests a hostelry might have stood on the site as much as a hundred years earlier and been visited in 1392 by [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], whose coat of arms included a white hart. The ground floor was originally stabling and in the mid-1700s the owners ran their own coach service to London. On 13 September 2009, the building and roof suffered significant damage during a fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/news/BRENTWOOD-Huge-blaze-hits-Sugar-Hut/article-1336005-detail/article.html|title=BRENTWOOD: Huge blaze hits Sugar Hut|work=Essex Chronicle|accessdate=20 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922234011/http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/news/BRENTWOOD-Huge-blaze-hits-Sugar-Hut/article-1336005-detail/article.html|archive-date=22 September 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Marygreen Manor, a handsome 16th-century building on London Road, is mentioned in [[Samuel Pepys]]' diaries and is said to have been often visited by the Tudor monarch [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] when Henry Roper, Gentleman Pursuant to Queen [[Catherine of Aragon]], lived there in 1514. It is now a hotel and restaurant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marygreenmanor.co.uk/|title=Marygreen Manor|publisher=Marygreenmanor.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> In 1686 Brentwood's inns were estimated to provide 110 beds and stabling for 183 horses.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} There were 11 inns in the town in 1788.
[[File:Ruins of St. Thomas a Becket chapel - geograph.org.uk - 1528751.jpg|thumb|The Baytree Centre]]
Protestant martyr [[William Hunter (Protestant martyr)|William Hunter]] was burnt at the stake in Brentwood in 1555. A monument to him was erected by subscription in 1861 at Wilson's Corner. [[Brentwood School (Essex)|Brentwood School]] was founded in 1557 and established in 1558, in Ingrave Road and behind the greens on Shenfield Road by [[Anthony Browne (justice)|Sir Anthony Browne]] and the site of Hunter's execution in commemorated by a plaque in the school. Thomas Munn, 'gentleman brickmaker' of Brentwood, met a less noble end when he was hanged for robbing the Yarmouth mail and his body was exhibited in chains at [[Gallows Corner]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} a road junction a few miles from Brentwood, in Romford. A ducking stool was mentioned in 1584.<ref name=\"History\"/>

As the Roman road grew busier, Brentwood became a major coaching stop for stagecoaches, with plenty of inns for overnight accommodation as the horses were rested. A 'stage' was approximately ten miles, and being about {{convert|20|mi|km}} from London, Brentwood would have been a second stop for travellers to [[East Anglia]]. This has not changed; there is an above average number of pubs in the area - possibly due to the army being stationed at [[Warley Barracks]] until 1958. Some of the pubs date back to the 15th and 16th centuries. Brentwood was also significant as a hub for the London postal service, with a major post office since the 18th century. The major post office on the high street was closed in the 2008 budget cuts; Brentwood residents now must rely on sub-post offices.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1435250/Post-office-closures-Full-list-of-branches.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Post office closures: Full list of branches | date=28 February 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref>

[[Daniel Defoe]] wrote about Brentwood as being \"...full of good inns, and chiefly maintained by the excessive multitude of carriers and passengers{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}, which are constantly passing this way to London, with droves of cattle, provisions and manufactures.\"

The 'Brentwood Ring', the earliest Christian ring ever to have been discovered in Britain was found in Brentwood in the late 1940s. It now resides at the [[British Museum]] in London. The only other ring of its type in existence can be found at the [[Vatican Museum]] in [[Rome]].<ref>Antiquaries Journal Volume 65 (1985) 'A Roman Christian ring from Brentwood, Essex' pgs. 461-463</ref>

===Modern history===
Brentwood originated as an ancient parish of 460 acres (1.86&nbsp;km²). In 1891 the population was 4,949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10235285&c_id=10001043&add=N|title=Vision of Britain|publisher=Visionofbritain.org.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> Under the [[Local Government Act 1894]], the Brentwood parish formed part of the [[Billericay Rural District]] of Essex. In 1899 the parish was removed from the rural district and formed the [[Brentwood Urban District]]. In 1934 the parish and district were enlarged by gaining Hutton, Ingrave and South Weald.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/bound_map_page.jsp?first=true&u_id=10235285&c_id=10001043 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001031847/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/bound_map_page.jsp?first=true&u_id=10235285&c_id=10001043 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2007-10-01 |title = Brentwood Ch/Tn/CP Essex through time &#124; Boundaries of Parish-level Unit}}</ref> The district was abolished in 1974 by the [[Local Government Act 1972]], and Brentwood urban district was joined with the parishes of Ingatestone and Fryerning, Mountnessing, Doddinghurst, Blackmore, Navestock, Kelvedon Hatch, and Stondon Massey to form the Brentwood district with a total area of 36,378 acres. In 1976 the new district was divided into 18 wards, with 39 councillors. In 1993, Brentwood gained borough status.

In 1917, the Roman Catholic church on Ingrave road was awarded cathedral status. Between 1989 and 1991 the building was modified to an Italianate Classical style. [[Brentwood Cathedral]] is currently the seat of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Bishop of Brentwood]].

Incidentally, [[Ingatestone Hall]], noted for its Roman Catholic connections through the Petres, is a 16th-century manor house built by Sir William Petre at Yenge-atte-Stone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touruk.co.uk/houses/housesessex_ingatestone.htm#text|title=Ingatestone Hall|publisher=Touruk.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130114024209/http://www.touruk.co.uk/houses/housesessex_ingatestone.htm#text|archive-date=14 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The staunch Petres played a significant role in the preservation of the Catholic faith in England. Sir William was assistant to [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] sought to [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolve the monasteries]] and ascended to the confidential post of Secretary of State, throughout the revolutionary changes of four Tudor monarchs: Henry VIII, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11780a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Family of Petre|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> Queen Mary, in 1553, on her way to claim her crown in London, stopped at Ingatestone Hall; later, Queen Elizabeth I spent several nights at the hall on her royal progress of 1561.

Today, Ingatestone Hall, like all other large Tudor houses, is an expression of wealth and status and retains many of the features of a 16th-century knightly residence, despite alterations by descendants who still live in the house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hidden-treasures.co.uk/search.php?id=53|title=Ingatestone Hall|website=Hidden Treasures of Essex|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614161927/http://www.hidden-treasures.co.uk/search.php?id=53|archivedate=14 June 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=18 May 2009}}</ref> Ingatestone Hall represented the exterior of Bleak House in the 2005 television adaptation of [[Charles Dickens]]' novel, and also appeared in an episode of the television series ''[[Lovejoy]]''. It is open to the public for tours, concerts, and performances; the hall and grounds can be rented for weddings and other occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touruk.co.uk/houses/housesessex_ingatestone.htm|title=Ingatestone Hall|publisher=Touruk.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130114024209/http://www.touruk.co.uk/houses/housesessex_ingatestone.htm|archive-date=14 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Brentwood was the location of [[Warley Hospital]], a [[psychiatric hospital]], from 1853 to 2001. A British [[East India Company]] elephant training school was based in Brentwood and this remained an active army base as a depot for the [[Essex Regiment]] until 1959,<ref name=\"History\"/>  when much of the site was redeveloped as the European headquarters for the [[Ford Motor Company]]. A few buildings remain from the Barracks – the regimental chapel, the gymnasium (now home to Brentwood Trampoline Club) and the officers' mess (now Marillac Hospital).

===Military history===
The military has associations with [[Warley, Essex|Warley]] going back over 200 years. It also had strategic importance during the time of the Spanish Armada - it was used as a meeting place for contingents from eight eastern and midland counties (900 horsemen assembled here) to then travel on to Tilbury. The local common was used as a military camp in 1742, and became a permanent feature as [[Warley Barracks]] in 1804.

During [[World War II]], over 1,000 bombs were dropped on Brentwood, with 19 flying bombs ([[V-1 flying bomb|V1]]), 32 long-range rockets ([[V2 rocket|V2]]) and many incendiary bombs and parachute mines. 5,038 houses were destroyed, 389 people were injured and 43 died. The 15th- and 16th-century pubs, however, survived. Brentwood had been considered a safe enough haven to evacuate London children here - 6,000 children arrived in September 1939 alone.

===Today===

The town is increasingly suburban, but it does have a very rural feel, with trees, fields and open spaces all around the town; Shenfield Common is also less than one mile from town centre shops.

Brentwood's high street has also been subject to major redevelopment works costing between £3 million and £7 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/searching/Brentwood-High-Street-revamp-slow/article-191438-detail/article.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130505084832/http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/searching/Brentwood-High-Street-revamp-slow/article-191438-detail/article.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 May 2013|title=This is Total Essex.co.uk|work=Essex Chronicle|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/latestnews/BRENTWOOD-Residents-doubt-value-6m-High-Street-improvements/article-922824-detail/article.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120913115307/http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/latestnews/BRENTWOOD-Residents-doubt-value-6m-High-Street-improvements/article-922824-detail/article.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 September 2012|title=This is Total Essex.co.uk|work=Essex Chronicle|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.brentwoodhighstreet.co.uk/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628091814/http://www.brentwoodhighstreet.co.uk/ |date=28 June 2009 }}</ref> This included the demolition of the ''Sir Charles Napier'' pub to build an additional lane to improve traffic flow at the west end of the high street, and re-laying the pavements and road surface in the high street itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/news/Save-town-s-heritage/article-704347-detail/article.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120919042424/http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/news/Save-town-s-heritage/article-704347-detail/article.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 September 2012|title=This is Total Essex.co.uk|work=Essex Chronicle|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>

The previous headquarters of electronics company [[Amstrad]] were located in Brentwood. The television show ''[[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' used overhead views of the [[Canary Wharf]] business district in London as an accompaniment to interior shots of the previous Amstrad offices, Amstrad House, which has since been converted into a [[Premier Inn]] hotel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwoodweeklynews.co.uk/news/localnews/4646465.New_hotel_set_to_open/|title=New hotel set to open|publisher=Brentwood Weekly News|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>

Brentwood forms part of the larger [[Brentwood (borough)|Borough of Brentwood]] which also encompasses the surrounding smaller suburbs and villages. For elections to Westminster, Brentwood forms part of the [[Brentwood and Ongar (UK Parliament constituency)|Brentwood and Ongar constituency]].

There is a proposal for creating [[Dunton Garden Suburb]] on land between Basildon and Brentwood. This proposal may have 6,000 homes, together with retail, commercial and leisure uses. This is a join proposal of the two councils and a public consultation ended in March 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dunton Garden Suburb - Joint Project with Brentwood Borough Council|url=http://www.basildon.gov.uk/dunton|website=Basildon Council|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref> The proposal has met with criticism from all political parties<ref>{{cite news|title=Parties unite to oppose Dunton Garden Suburb plans|url=http://www.halsteadgazette.co.uk/news/south_essex_news/11860209.Parties_unite_to_oppose_Dunton_Garden_Suburb_plans/|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=Halstead Gazette|date=17 March 2015}}</ref> and the residents group Residents Against Inappropriate Development<ref>{{cite web|title=Say No to Dunton Garden Suburb|url=http://www.raid.org.uk/|website=Residents Against Inappropriate Development|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref>

==Arts and media==
The Brentwood Theatre and The Hermitage are the main cultural buildings in Brentwood, located on the same site in the town centre.

Brentwood Theatre is a fully fitted community theatre that serves more than 40 non-professional performing arts groups.<ref name=\"bwood-theatre-1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwood-theatre.org|title=Brentwood Theatre|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref>  Owned and maintained by an independent charity, Brentwood Theatre receives no regular arts funding or subsidy.  The Hermitage is used as the centre for Brentwood Youth Service.

The Hermitage youth service operates its own cafe, youth club and a live music venue called ''The Hermit'', which has had hosted bands such as [[Motörhead]] and [[InMe]]. InMe were heavily supported in their early years by the venue, whose purpose is to promote and encourage youth bands. It also plays host to private events such as a weekly jazz club that was run by the saxophonist [[Spike Robinson]] until his death. Both venues co-host the Brentwood Blues Festival, a music event that has played host to the [[Ian Dury and the Blockheads|Blockheads]] and [[Bill Wyman]]. The Brentwood Centre, on the edge of town, hosts the annual [[Brentwood Festival]] which has included acts such as [[UB40]] and [[The Dualers]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.essexchronicle.co.uk/Brentwood-Festival-Brentwood-Gazette/story-21262859-detail/story.html|title=Brentwood Festival - Brentwood Centre|newspaper=Essex Chronicle|date=19 July 2014|accessdate=12 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802014308/http://www.essexchronicle.co.uk/Brentwood-Festival-Brentwood-Gazette/story-21262859-detail/story.html|archive-date=2 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A community radio station, [[Phoenix FM]] serves the Brentwood area. The station was formed in August 1996 and broadcast ten trial broadcasts under a restricted service licence, each lasting 28 days, the first starting on 29 December 1996 and the last ending on 25 February 2006. On 23 March 2007, the station started to broadcast permanently on 98.0&nbsp;FM, featuring popular music, local musicians and acts, local events, and interviews with key local figures.

The Brentwood Art Trail has become a popular annual summer event which was developed to create an arts experience whereby art created by local people can be recognised and appreciated. The next one is planned for August 30-September 13, 2018.

Brentwood is also home to the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, which perform at many events throughout the year. It is a successful band and attracts youngsters from the age of 10 from Brentwood and surrounding areas. It was the first British band to ever take part in the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]]<ref>[http://www.tournamentofroses.com/roseparade/participants.asp ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218053226/http://www.tournamentofroses.com/roseparade/participants.asp |date=18 December 2008 }}</ref> in [[Pasadena, California]] and the first youth band to play the International Military Music Festival \"Spasskaya Tower\" Tattoo on Red Square, Moscow. It meets twice a week in Warley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwoodlegionband.co.uk|title=WELCOME TO THE ROYAL BRITISH LEGION YOUTH BAND, BRENTWOOD|publisher=Brentwoodlegionband.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>

Among the many theatre companies in the region, Brentwood Operatic Society and Shenfield Operatic Society are two that represent the many groups providing excellent theatrical productions for the community. Brentwood Operatic Society also trains young actors with its ''BOSSY Youth'' acting program,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwood-operatic.com/|title=Brentwood Operatic Society|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> headed by Gaynor Wilson, who formerly directed actor Stephen Moyer. David Pickthall serves as musical director<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsbigband.co.uk/Pages/director.html |accessdate=27 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820161210/http://www.bsbigband.co.uk/Pages/director.html |archivedate=20 August 2008 }}</ref> when not scoring films and television shows for the BBC, directing British orchestras, and composing. The award-winning composer wrote two operas and three musicals, published worldwide by Samuel French Ltd. He is also the musical voice of the villainous penguin in the Oscar-winning ''Wallace & Grommit: The Wrong Trousers''.

Brentwood's Orchestras for Young People was founded in 1990 and grew to include five ensembles for orchestral instrumentalists of school age, who perform regularly in and around the town. Regular rehearsals and workshops introduce the musicians to a wide variety of music, from well-known classical pieces to modern music.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Tuneful Town|last=Adams|first=Nicky|date=January 2009|work=Essex Life|publisher=Archant|pages=55–58}}</ref>

The Brentwood Performing Arts Festival has now been accepted into membership by the British and International Federation of Festivals of which Queen Elizabeth II is patron.  With this, the Festival has achieved recognition as the Festival of Performing Arts for Brentwood.

The town is the venue of the Brentwood International Chess Congress which was set up in 2006 and first ran 17–18 February 2007. The congress attracted 235 competitors who included three [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmasters]] and five [[International Master]]s. The prize fund is relatively generous in comparison to many other similar congresses, being around £4,000. In 2007 it was the largest chess competition to be held in Essex and was organised by Brentwood Chess Club.

==Sport, parks and open spaces==
Although close to the extremities of [[Greater London]], Brentwood is surrounded by open countryside and woodland.  This has been cited as showing the success of the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] in halting the outward spread of London's built-up area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwood.gov.uk/brentwood_local_plan/chapter7.html |title=Brentwood Borough Council - Brentwood Local Plan - Green Belt & the Countryside |publisher=Brentwood.gov.uk |accessdate=20 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025850/http://www.brentwood.gov.uk/brentwood_local_plan/chapter7.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Brentwood has a number of public open spaces including [[List of King George V Playing Fields in Essex|King George V Playing Field]], Shenfield Common, and two country parks at South Weald and Thorndon. [[Weald Country Park]] was first chosen to hold the 2012 Olympics mountain biking but was declared to be \"too easy\" a course. Brentwood does however host a number of Criterium Cycle Races that attract many of Britain's greatest cyclists.

The town has two large sports centres providing access to a range of sports including badminton, squash, swimming, and football. There are a number of golf courses, including a 70-par municipal course very close to the town centre at Hartswood<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=431 |title=Brentwood Borough Council - Leisure and Culture - Sports and Activities - Golf |publisher=Brentwood-council.gov.uk |accessdate=20 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829084200/http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=431 |archivedate=29 August 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> as well as others in the surrounding countryside. A number of cricket clubs exist in and around the town although the County Ground, closest to the town centre,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwoodcc.co.uk/ |accessdate=11 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205221742/http://www.brentwoodcc.co.uk/ |archivedate=5 February 2007 |title=Brentwood Cricket Club - the Best Cricket Club in Brentwood }}</ref> no longer hosts Essex matches. Brentwood is also home to [[non-league football]] club [[Brentwood Town F.C.]] and basketball team [[London Leopards]], who both play at the Brentwood Centre Arena. The town is also home to London league club Brentwood RLFC, the only rugby league club in west Essex. Brentwood Hockey Club is also based in the town at the Old County Ground and fielded 6 mens and 5 ladies league teams for the 2014-15 season.

Although no longer manufactured here, Brentwood became the centre of [[trampolining]] in the United Kingdom between 1965 and 1981 after [[George Nissen]] brought the new sport to the town in 1949 and eventually manufactured trampolines in the town, continuing to do so for many years after they ceased production in the US for fear of litigation. [[Ted Blake]], a long-term Brentwood resident, was managing director of Nissen UK from its inception until shortly before it closed and became a leading figure worldwide in the development of modern trampolining. Brentwood still has a thriving trampolining community but no longer a local factory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwoodtc.org/history.htm|title=Brentwood Trampoline Club|publisher=Brentwoodtc.org|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>

The town also has a large [[volleyball]] club and the only [[Team handball|handball]] club in Essex.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/essex/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8869000/8869186.stm | work=BBC News | first=Francis | last=Kelly | title=Handball handed popularity rise | date=2 August 2010}}</ref>

Beyond this are residential developments surrounded by open countryside and woodland; some of this countryside lies within only a few hundred yards of the town centre.

Brentwood has been [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] since 1978 with [[Roth, Bavaria|Roth]], Germany and since 1994 with [[Montbazon]], France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwood.gov.uk/index.php?cid=2356 |title=Town Twinning |publisher=Brentwood Borough Council |accessdate=15 March 2014}}</ref> It also has a relationship with [[Brentwood, Tennessee]] in the United States.

==History==

===Etymology===
The name was assumed by some in the 1700s to derive from a corruption of the words 'burnt' and 'wood', with the name Burntwood still visible on some 18th-century maps. However, ''[[Brent (name)|brent]]'' was the middle English for \"burnt\". The name describes the presumed reason for settlement in the part of the Forest of Essex (later [[Epping Forest]]) that would have covered the area, where a major occupation was charcoal burning.

===Early history===
Although a [[Bronze Age]] axe has been found in Brentwood and there are clear signs of an entrenched encampment in [[Weald Country Park]], it is considered unlikely that there was any significant early settlement of the area. At the time, most of Essex was covered by the [[Epping Forest|Great Forest]]. It is believed that despite the Roman road between [[London]] and [[Colchester]] passing through the town, the [[Saxons]] were the earliest settlers of the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=52 |title=Foundation of the Town |publisher=Brentwood-council.gov.uk |accessdate=20 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122133853/http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=52 |archivedate=22 January 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref>

The borough was on a crossroads, where the Roman road from [[Colchester]] to London crossed the route the pilgrims took over the [[River Thames]] to Canterbury. A chapel was built in or around 1221, and in 1227 a market charter was granted. Its growth may have been stimulated by the cult of St. Thomas the Martyr, to whom the chapel was dedicated: the 12th-century ruin of [[Thomas Becket]] Chapel was a popular stopping point for pilgrims on their way to Canterbury. The ruin stands in the centre of the high street and the nearby parish church of Brentwood retains the dedication to St. Thomas of Canterbury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-thomas.org.uk|title=Anglican Parish of St Thomas of Canterbury|publisher=St-thomas.org.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> [[Pilgrims Hatch]], or 'Pilgrims' gate', was probably named from pilgrims who crossed through on their way to the chapel. It is likely, however, that Brentwood's development was due chiefly to its main road position, its market, and its convenient location as an administrative centre. Early industries were connected mainly with textile and garment making, brewing, and brickmaking.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63844&strquery=brentwood%20martyr|title=British History Online : Brentwood|publisher=British-history.ac.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>

During the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, Brentwood was the meeting place for some of the instigators, such as [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]]. They apparently met regularly in local pubs and inns. The first event of the Peasants' Revolt occurred in Brentwood, when men from Fobbing, Corringham and Stanford were summoned by the commissioner Thomas Bampton to Brentwood to answer as to who had avoided paying the poll tax.  Bampton insisted that the peasants pay what was demanded of them. The peasants refused to pay and a riot ensued as Bampton attempted to arrest the peasants. The peasants moved to kill Bampton, but he managed to escape to London. The rioters then, fearing the repercussions of what they had done, fled into the forest. After the riot the peasants sent word to the rest of the country and initiated the Peasants' Revolt.<ref>Dedman, M., 2012. Peasants were revolting - and they did it right here. ''Brentwood Gazette'', 6 Jun p. 20.</ref> The Essex [[assizes]] were sometimes held here, as well as at [[Chelmsford]]. One such pub was ''The White Hart''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/54568|title=The White Hart, Brentwood High Street (C) John Winfield :: Geograph Britain and Ireland|publisher=Geograph.org.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> (now a nightclub called ''[[Sugar Hut]] Village'' and showing little of its original historic interest), which is one of the oldest buildings in Brentwood; it is believed to have been built in 1480 although apocryphal evidence suggests a hostelry might have stood on the site as much as a hundred years earlier and been visited in 1392 by [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], whose coat of arms included a white hart. The ground floor was originally stabling and in the mid-1700s the owners ran their own coach service to London. On 13 September 2009, the building and roof suffered significant damage during a fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/news/BRENTWOOD-Huge-blaze-hits-Sugar-Hut/article-1336005-detail/article.html|title=BRENTWOOD: Huge blaze hits Sugar Hut|work=Essex Chronicle|accessdate=20 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922234011/http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/news/BRENTWOOD-Huge-blaze-hits-Sugar-Hut/article-1336005-detail/article.html|archive-date=22 September 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Marygreen Manor, a handsome 16th-century building on London Road, is mentioned in [[Samuel Pepys]]' diaries and is said to have been often visited by the Tudor monarch [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] when Henry Roper, Gentleman Pursuant to Queen [[Catherine of Aragon]], lived there in 1514. It is now a hotel and restaurant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marygreenmanor.co.uk/|title=Marygreen Manor|publisher=Marygreenmanor.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> In 1686 Brentwood's inns were estimated to provide 110 beds and stabling for 183 horses.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} There were 11 inns in the town in 1788.

Protestant martyr [[William Hunter (Protestant martyr)|William Hunter]] was burnt at the stake in Brentwood in 1555. A monument to him was erected by subscription in 1861 at Wilson's Corner. [[Brentwood School (Essex)|Brentwood School]] was founded in 1557 and established in 1558, in Ingrave Road and behind the greens on Shenfield Road by [[Anthony Browne (justice)|Sir Anthony Browne]] and the site of Hunter's execution in commemorated by a plaque in the school. Thomas Munn, 'gentleman brickmaker' of Brentwood, met a less noble end when he was hanged for robbing the Yarmouth mail and his body was exhibited in chains at [[Gallows Corner]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} a road junction a few miles from Brentwood, in Romford. A ducking stool was mentioned in 1584.<ref name=\"History\"/>

As the Roman road grew busier, Brentwood became a major coaching stop for stagecoaches, with plenty of inns for overnight accommodation as the horses were rested. A 'stage' was approximately ten miles, and being about {{convert|20|mi|km}} from London, Brentwood would have been a second stop for travellers to [[East Anglia]]. This has not changed; there is an above average number of pubs in the area - possibly due to the army being stationed at [[Warley Barracks]] until 1958. Some of the pubs date back to the 15th and 16th centuries. Brentwood was also significant as a hub for the London postal service, with a major post office since the 18th century. The major post office on the high street was closed in the 2008 budget cuts; Brentwood residents now must rely on sub-post offices.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1435250/Post-office-closures-Full-list-of-branches.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Post office closures: Full list of branches | date=28 February 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref>

[[Daniel Defoe]] wrote about Brentwood as being \"...full of good inns, and chiefly maintained by the excessive multitude of carriers and passengers{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}, which are constantly passing this way to London, with droves of cattle, provisions and manufactures.\"

The 'Brentwood Ring', the earliest Christian ring ever to have been discovered in Britain was found in Brentwood in the late 1940s. It now resides at the [[British Museum]] in London. The only other ring of its type in existence can be found at the [[Vatican Museum]] in [[Rome]].<ref>Antiquaries Journal Volume 65 (1985) 'A Roman Christian ring from Brentwood, Essex' pgs. 461-463</ref>

===Modern history===
Brentwood originated as an ancient parish of 460 acres (1.86&nbsp;km²). In 1891 the population was 4,949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10235285&c_id=10001043&add=N|title=Vision of Britain|publisher=Visionofbritain.org.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> Under the [[Local Government Act 1894]], the Brentwood parish formed part of the [[Billericay Rural District]] of Essex. In 1899 the parish was removed from the rural district and formed the [[Brentwood Urban District]]. In 1934 the parish and district were enlarged by gaining Hutton, Ingrave and South Weald.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/bound_map_page.jsp?first=true&u_id=10235285&c_id=10001043 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001031847/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/bound_map_page.jsp?first=true&u_id=10235285&c_id=10001043 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2007-10-01 |title = Brentwood Ch/Tn/CP Essex through time &#124; Boundaries of Parish-level Unit}}</ref> The district was abolished in 1974 by the [[Local Government Act 1972]], and Brentwood urban district was joined with the parishes of Ingatestone and Fryerning, Mountnessing, Doddinghurst, Blackmore, Navestock, Kelvedon Hatch, and Stondon Massey to form the Brentwood district with a total area of 36,378 acres. In 1976 the new district was divided into 18 wards, with 39 councillors. In 1993, Brentwood gained borough status.

In 1917, the Roman Catholic church on Ingrave road was awarded cathedral status. Between 1989 and 1991 the building was modified to an Italianate Classical style. [[Brentwood Cathedral]] is currently the seat of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Bishop of Brentwood]].

Incidentally, [[Ingatestone Hall]], noted for its Roman Catholic connections through the Petres, is a 16th-century manor house built by Sir William Petre at Yenge-atte-Stone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touruk.co.uk/houses/housesessex_ingatestone.htm#text|title=Ingatestone Hall|publisher=Touruk.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130114024209/http://www.touruk.co.uk/houses/housesessex_ingatestone.htm#text|archive-date=14 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The staunch Petres played a significant role in the preservation of the Catholic faith in England. Sir William was assistant to [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] sought to [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolve the monasteries]] and ascended to the confidential post of Secretary of State, throughout the revolutionary changes of four Tudor monarchs: Henry VIII, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11780a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Family of Petre|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> Queen Mary, in 1553, on her way to claim her crown in London, stopped at Ingatestone Hall; later, Queen Elizabeth I spent several nights at the hall on her royal progress of 1561.

Today, Ingatestone Hall, like all other large Tudor houses, is an expression of wealth and status and retains many of the features of a 16th-century knightly residence, despite alterations by descendants who still live in the house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hidden-treasures.co.uk/search.php?id=53|title=Ingatestone Hall|website=Hidden Treasures of Essex|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614161927/http://www.hidden-treasures.co.uk/search.php?id=53|archivedate=14 June 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=18 May 2009}}</ref> Ingatestone Hall represented the exterior of Bleak House in the 2005 television adaptation of [[Charles Dickens]]' novel, and also appeared in an episode of the television series ''[[Lovejoy]]''. It is open to the public for tours, concerts, and performances; the hall and grounds can be rented for weddings and other occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touruk.co.uk/houses/housesessex_ingatestone.htm|title=Ingatestone Hall|publisher=Touruk.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130114024209/http://www.touruk.co.uk/houses/housesessex_ingatestone.htm|archive-date=14 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Brentwood was the location of [[Warley Hospital]], a [[psychiatric hospital]], from 1853 to 2001. A British [[East India Company]] elephant training school was based in Brentwood and this remained an active army base as a depot for the [[Essex Regiment]] until 1959,<ref name=\"History\"/>  when much of the site was redeveloped as the European headquarters for the [[Ford Motor Company]]. A few buildings remain from the Barracks – the regimental chapel, the gymnasium (now home to Brentwood Trampoline Club) and the officers' mess (now Marillac Hospital).

===Military history===
The military has associations with [[Warley, Essex|Warley]] going back over 200 years. It also had strategic importance during the time of the Spanish Armada - it was used as a meeting place for contingents from eight eastern and midland counties (900 horsemen assembled here) to then travel on to Tilbury. The local common was used as a military camp in 1742, and became a permanent feature as [[Warley Barracks]] in 1804.

During [[World War II]], over 1,000 bombs were dropped on Brentwood, with 19 flying bombs ([[V-1 flying bomb|V1]]), 32 long-range rockets ([[V2 rocket|V2]]) and many incendiary bombs and parachute mines. 5,038 houses were destroyed, 389 people were injured and 43 died. The 15th- and 16th-century pubs, however, survived. Brentwood had been considered a safe enough haven to evacuate London children here - 6,000 children arrived in September 1939 alone.

===Today===

The town is increasingly suburban, but it does have a very rural feel, with trees, fields and open spaces all around the town; Shenfield Common is also less than one mile from town centre shops.

Brentwood's high street has also been subject to major redevelopment works costing between £3 million and £7 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/searching/Brentwood-High-Street-revamp-slow/article-191438-detail/article.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130505084832/http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/searching/Brentwood-High-Street-revamp-slow/article-191438-detail/article.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 May 2013|title=This is Total Essex.co.uk|work=Essex Chronicle|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/latestnews/BRENTWOOD-Residents-doubt-value-6m-High-Street-improvements/article-922824-detail/article.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120913115307/http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/latestnews/BRENTWOOD-Residents-doubt-value-6m-High-Street-improvements/article-922824-detail/article.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 September 2012|title=This is Total Essex.co.uk|work=Essex Chronicle|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.brentwoodhighstreet.co.uk/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628091814/http://www.brentwoodhighstreet.co.uk/ |date=28 June 2009 }}</ref> This included the demolition of the ''Sir Charles Napier'' pub to build an additional lane to improve traffic flow at the west end of the high street, and re-laying the pavements and road surface in the high street itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/news/Save-town-s-heritage/article-704347-detail/article.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120919042424/http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/news/Save-town-s-heritage/article-704347-detail/article.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 September 2012|title=This is Total Essex.co.uk|work=Essex Chronicle|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>

A community radio station, [[Phoenix FM]] serves the Brentwood area. The station was formed in August 1996 and broadcast ten trial broadcasts under a restricted service licence, each lasting 28 days, the first starting on 29 December 1996 and the last ending on 25 February 2006. On 23 March 2007, the station started to broadcast permanently on 98.0&nbsp;FM, featuring popular music, local musicians and acts, local events, and interviews with key local figures.

The Brentwood Art Trail has become a popular annual summer event which was developed to create an arts experience whereby art created by local people can be recognised and appreciated. The next one is planned for August 30-September 13, 2018.

Brentwood is also home to the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, which perform at many events throughout the year. It is a successful band and attracts youngsters from the age of 10 from Brentwood and surrounding areas. It was the first British band to ever take part in the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]]<ref>[http://www.tournamentofroses.com/roseparade/participants.asp ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218053226/http://www.tournamentofroses.com/roseparade/participants.asp |date=18 December 2008 }}</ref> in [[Pasadena, California]] and the first youth band to play the International Military Music Festival \"Spasskaya Tower\" Tattoo on Red Square, Moscow.

The award-winning composer wrote two operas and three musicals, published worldwide by Samuel French Ltd. He is also the musical voice of the villainous penguin in the Oscar-winning ''Wallace & Grommit: The Wrong Trousers''.

Brentwood's Orchestras for Young People was founded in 1990 and grew to include five ensembles for orchestral instrumentalists of school age, who perform regularly in and around the town. Regular rehearsals and workshops introduce the musicians to a wide variety of music, from well-known classical pieces to modern music.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Tuneful Town|last=Adams|first=Nicky|date=January 2009|work=Essex Life|publisher=Archant|pages=55–58}}</ref>

The Brentwood Performing Arts Festival has now been accepted into membership by the British and International Federation of Festivals of which Queen Elizabeth II is patron.  With this, the Festival has achieved recognition as the Festival of Performing Arts for Brentwood.

The town is the venue of the Brentwood International Chess Congress which was set up in 2006 and first ran 17–18 February 2007. The congress attracted 235 competitors who included three [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmasters]] and five [[International Master]]s. The prize fund is relatively generous in comparison to many other similar congresses, being around £4,000. In 2007 it was the largest chess competition to be held in Essex and was organised by Brentwood Chess Club.

==Sport, parks and open spaces==
Although close to the extremities of [[Greater London]], Brentwood is surrounded by open countryside and woodland.  This has been cited as showing the success of the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] in halting the outward spread of London's built-up area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwood.gov.uk/brentwood_local_plan/chapter7.html |title=Brentwood Borough Council - Brentwood Local Plan - Green Belt & the Countryside |publisher=Brentwood.gov.uk |accessdate=20 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025850/http://www.brentwood.gov.uk/brentwood_local_plan/chapter7.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Brentwood has a number of public open spaces including [[List of King George V Playing Fields in Essex|King George V Playing Field]], Shenfield Common, and two country parks at South Weald and Thorndon. [[Weald Country Park]] was first chosen to hold the 2012 Olympics mountain biking but was declared to be \"too easy\" a course. Brentwood does however host a number of Criterium Cycle Races that attract many of Britain's greatest cyclists.

The town has two large sports centres providing access to a range of sports including badminton, squash, swimming, and football. There are a number of golf courses, including a 70-par municipal course very close to the town centre at Hartswood<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=431 |title=Brentwood Borough Council - Leisure and Culture - Sports and Activities - Golf |publisher=Brentwood-council.gov.uk |accessdate=20 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829084200/http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=431 |archivedate=29 August 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> as well as others in the surrounding countryside. A number of cricket clubs exist in and around the town although the County Ground, closest to the town centre,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwoodcc.co.uk/ |accessdate=11 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205221742/http://www.brentwoodcc.co.uk/ |archivedate=5 February 2007 |title=Brentwood Cricket Club - the Best Cricket Club in Brentwood }}</ref> no longer hosts Essex matches. Brentwood is also home to [[non-league football]] club [[Brentwood Town F.C.]] and basketball team [[London Leopards]], who both play at the Brentwood Centre Arena. The town is also home to London league club Brentwood RLFC, the only rugby league club in west Essex. Brentwood Hockey Club is also based in the town at the Old County Ground and fielded 6 mens and 5 ladies league teams for the 2014-15 season.

Although no longer manufactured here, Brentwood became the centre of [[trampolining]] in the United Kingdom between 1965 and 1981 after [[George Nissen]] brought the new sport to the town in 1949 and eventually manufactured trampolines in the town, continuing to do so for many years after they ceased production in the US for fear of litigation. [[Ted Blake]], a long-term Brentwood resident, was managing director of Nissen UK from its inception until shortly before it closed and became a leading figure worldwide in the development of modern trampolining. Brentwood still has a thriving trampolining community but no longer a local factory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwoodtc.org/history.htm|title=Brentwood Trampoline Club|publisher=Brentwoodtc.org|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>

The town also has a large [[volleyball]] club and the only [[Team handball|handball]] club in Essex.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/essex/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8869000/8869186.stm | work=BBC News | first=Francis | last=Kelly | title=Handball handed popularity rise | date=2 August 2010}}</ref>

'''Starke County''' is a [[County (United States)|county]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Indiana]].  As of 2010, the population was 23,363.<ref name=QF>{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/18/18149.html|title=Starke County QuickFacts|accessdate=25 September 2011|publisher=US Census Bureau}}</ref> The [[county seat]] is [[Knox, Indiana|Knox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=7 June 2011|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref>

==History==
Starke County was created in 1835 and organized in 1850.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.starkehistory.com/index_files/Page832.htm |title=Starke County Historical Society. Retrieved 1 January 2010. |access-date=1 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716131523/http://www.starkehistory.com/index_files/Page832.htm |archive-date=16 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was named for Gen. [[John Stark]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Ronald L.|last=Baker|author2=Marvin Carmony |title=Indiana Place Names|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|year=1995|isbn=0-253-28340-X|page=158}}</ref> who commanded [[New Hampshire]] troops at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] in 1775 in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], and who defeated the British at the [[Battle of Bennington]] in 1777.<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

Before white settlement, all of the land that forms modern-day Starke County and adjacent [[LaPorte County]] to the north was inhabited by the [[Potawatami]] Indian nation. These groups were forcibly removed to Kansas by the United States government in 1838, and many died on what has been called the [[Potawatomi Trail of Death|Trail of Death]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scpl.lib.in.us/historical/timeline/timeline.pdf|format=PDF|title=Starke County Public Library factsheet|work=scpl.lib.in.us|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624190211/http://www.scpl.lib.in.us/historical/timeline/timeline.pdf|archivedate=24 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potawatomi-tda.org/ptodhist.htm|title=History of 1838 Trail of Death|work=potawatomi-tda.org}}</ref>

When Starke County was created, it included the present LaPorte County townships of [[Cass Township, LaPorte County, Indiana|Cass]], [[Dewey Township, LaPorte County, Indiana|Dewey]], [[Hanna Township, LaPorte County, Indiana|Hanna]], and [[Prairie Township, LaPorte County, Indiana|Prairie]]. It was necessary for residents in this area to travel some distance east to Lemon's Bridge to cross the [[Kankakee River]] in order to travel south to the center of the county, the future site of the county seat at Knox. Therefore, because they were effectively isolated from the rest of Starke county, residents north of the river petitioned to be annexed to LaPorte county and this was done on January 28, 1842.<ref>[http://www.laportecountyhistory.org/history.htm Brief history of LaPorte county] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517164346/http://laportecountyhistory.org/history.htm|date=20080517|accessdate=17 May 2008}}</ref>

==Name==
Despite being named for General John Stark and originally being known and appearing on maps as ''Stark'' County<ref>{{cite web|url=http://housedivided.dickinson.edu/main/index.php?q=node/19540|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709114000/http://housedivided.dickinson.edu/main/index.php?q=node/19540|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 July 2012|title=Stark County, Indiana, 1857|work=dickinson.edu}}</ref> when initially created and organized, an ''e'' was added to the county's name fairly early in its history. There does not seem to be any solid evidence to clearly explain this alteration. Three possible explanations have been advanced: an early scribe had 'fancy lettering', including a ''k'' with a long tail or flourish that appeared to others as ''ke'', the new spelling sticking;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starkehistory.com/index_files/Page1027.htm|title=Starke or Stark|website=www.starkehistory.com|accessdate=11 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517124420/http://www.starkehistory.com/index_files/Page1027.htm|archive-date=17 May 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> General Stark himself may have used a similar flourish at the end of his signature;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countyhistory.com/starke/start.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=16 January 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515193727/http://www.countyhistory.com/starke/start.html|archivedate=15 May 2008}}</ref> which became a point of confusion to Indiana officials (This seems unlikely, since Stark County in Ohio (1808) and Illinois (1839) both preceded Starke County, Indiana and offered clear precedence and guidance on the spelling of the name, not to mention other numerous settlements within the United States named after the General also preceding Starke County.); it is thought that the change occurred around 1860 as the result of a clerical error by an official in [[Indianapolis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starkehistory.com/index_files/timeline.pdf|title=Archived copy|accessdate=16 January 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325014748/http://www.starkehistory.com/index_files/timeline.pdf|archivedate=25 March 2009}}</ref>

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]] and the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts to four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name=inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html|title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=16 September 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name=inc2102>{{cite web|author=Indiana Code|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf|title=Title 2, Article 10, Section 2|accessdate=16 September 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners, who are elected county-wide to staggered four-year terms. One commissioner serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name=inc3623/><ref name=inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The judge on the court is elected to a term of six years. The judge is assisted by a magistrate who is appointed by the judge. The court handles criminal and civil cases, and has a small claims division. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name=inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]], elected to four-year terms. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name=inc2102/>

Starke County is part of [[Indiana's 2nd congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]; a district that has been represented by [[Jackie Walorski]] since January 2013.

==History==
Starke County was created in 1835 and organized in 1850.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.starkehistory.com/index_files/Page832.htm |title=Starke County Historical Society. Retrieved 1 January 2010. |access-date=1 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716131523/http://www.starkehistory.com/index_files/Page832.htm |archive-date=16 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was named for Gen. [[John Stark]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Ronald L.|last=Baker|author2=Marvin Carmony |title=Indiana Place Names|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|year=1995|isbn=0-253-28340-X|page=158}}</ref> who commanded [[New Hampshire]] troops at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] in 1775 in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], and who defeated the British at the [[Battle of Bennington]] in 1777.<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

Before white settlement, all of the land that forms modern-day Starke County and adjacent [[LaPorte County]] to the north was inhabited by the [[Potawatami]] Indian nation. These groups were forcibly removed to Kansas by the United States government in 1838, and many died on what has been called the [[Potawatomi Trail of Death|Trail of Death]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scpl.lib.in.us/historical/timeline/timeline.pdf|format=PDF|title=Starke County Public Library factsheet|work=scpl.lib.in.us|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624190211/http://www.scpl.lib.in.us/historical/timeline/timeline.pdf|archivedate=24 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potawatomi-tda.org/ptodhist.htm|title=History of 1838 Trail of Death|work=potawatomi-tda.org}}</ref>

When Starke County was created, it included the present LaPorte County townships of [[Cass Township, LaPorte County, Indiana|Cass]], [[Dewey Township, LaPorte County, Indiana|Dewey]], [[Hanna Township, LaPorte County, Indiana|Hanna]], and [[Prairie Township, LaPorte County, Indiana|Prairie]]. It was necessary for residents in this area to travel some distance east to Lemon's Bridge to cross the [[Kankakee River]] in order to travel south to the center of the county, the future site of the county seat at Knox. Therefore, because they were effectively isolated from the rest of Starke county, residents north of the river petitioned to be annexed to LaPorte county and this was done on January 28, 1842.<ref>[http://www.laportecountyhistory.org/history.htm Brief history of LaPorte county] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517164346/http://laportecountyhistory.org/history.htm|date=20080517|accessdate=17 May 2008}}</ref>

==Name==

There does not seem to be any solid evidence to clearly explain this alteration. Three possible explanations have been advanced: an early scribe had 'fancy lettering', including a ''k'' with a long tail or flourish that appeared to others as ''ke'', the new spelling sticking;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starkehistory.com/index_files/Page1027.htm|title=Starke or Stark|website=www.starkehistory.com|accessdate=11 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517124420/http://www.starkehistory.com/index_files/Page1027.htm|archive-date=17 May 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> General Stark himself may have used a similar flourish at the end of his signature;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countyhistory.com/starke/start.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=16 January 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515193727/http://www.countyhistory.com/starke/start.html|archivedate=15 May 2008}}</ref> which became a point of confusion to Indiana officials (This seems unlikely, since Stark County in Ohio (1808) and Illinois (1839) both preceded Starke County, Indiana and offered clear precedence and guidance on the spelling of the name, not to mention other numerous settlements within the United States named after the General also preceding Starke County.); it is thought that the change occurred around 1860 as the result of a clerical error by an official in [[Indianapolis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starkehistory.com/index_files/timeline.pdf|title=Archived copy|accessdate=16 January 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325014748/http://www.starkehistory.com/index_files/timeline.pdf|archivedate=25 March 2009}}</ref>

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]] and the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts to four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name=inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html|title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=16 September 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name=inc2102>{{cite web|author=Indiana Code|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf|title=Title 2, Article 10, Section 2|accessdate=16 September 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners, who are elected county-wide to staggered four-year terms. One commissioner serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name=inc3623/><ref name=inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The judge on the court is elected to a term of six years. The judge is assisted by a magistrate who is appointed by the judge. The court handles criminal and civil cases, and has a small claims division. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name=inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]], elected to four-year terms. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name=inc2102/>

Starke County is part of [[Indiana's 2nd congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]; a district that has been represented by [[Jackie Walorski]] since January 2013.

The '''International Football Association Board''' ('''IFAB''') is the body that determines the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] of [[association football]]. IFAB was founded in 1886 to agree standardised Laws for international competition, and has since acted as the \"guardian\" of the internationally used Laws. Since its establishment in 1904, [[Fédération Internationale de Football Association|FIFA]], the sport's top governing body, has recognised IFAB's jurisdiction over the Laws.<ref name=\"Dunmore2011\">{{cite book|author=Tom Dunmore|title=Historical Dictionary of Soccer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9j1wbp2t1usC&pg=PA150|date=16 September 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7188-5|pages=150–}}</ref> IFAB is known to take a highly conservative attitude regarding changes to the Laws of the Game.<ref name=tele_sinbin>{{cite news|title=Sin-bins will by considered by Fifa rulemakers Ifab after support from Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/10568924/Sin-bins-will-by-considered-by-Fifa-rulemakers-Ifab-after-support-from-Sepp-Blatter-and-Michel-Platini.html|accessdate=6 October 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=13 January 2014}}</ref>

It is a separate body from FIFA, though FIFA is represented on the board and holds 50% of the voting power. As a legacy of association football's origins in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], the other organisations represented are the governing bodies of the game in the four [[countries of the United Kingdom|countries of the UK]]. Amendments to the Laws require a three-quarter [[supermajority]] vote, meaning that FIFA's support is necessary but not sufficient for a motion to pass.

==Operations==
IFAB is made up of representatives from each of the United Kingdom's pioneering football associations—England's [[The Football Association|Football Association]] (The FA), the [[Scottish Football Association]] (SFA), the [[Football Association of Wales]] (FAW) and Northern Ireland's [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA)—and the [[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA), the international governing body for football. Each British association has one vote and FIFA has four. IFAB deliberations must be approved by three-quarters of the vote, or at least six of the eight votes.<ref name=\"IFAB Article 7\">{{cite web|url=http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/63/IFAB_Statutes_v2.0.pdf |title=Article 7: General Assembly |work=Statutes of the International Association Football Board (IFAB) |date=5 March 2016 |accessdate=21 July 2016}}</ref> Thus, FIFA's approval is necessary for any IFAB decision, but FIFA alone cannot change the Laws of the Game—they need to be agreed by at least two of the UK members. As of 2016, all members must be present for a binding vote to proceed.<ref name=\"IFAB Article 7\"/>

The Board meets twice a year, once to decide on possible changes to the rules governing the game of Football (the Annual General Meeting (AGM)) and once to deliberate on its internal affairs (the Annual Business Meeting (ABM)). In [[FIFA World Cup]] years, the AGM is held at FIFA's offices; otherwise, it rotates between Northern Ireland, Wales, England and Scotland in that order.<ref name=\"IFAB Article 7\"/> Four weeks before the AGM, the member associations must send their written proposals to the secretary of the host association. FIFA then prints a list of suggestions that are distributed to all other associations for examination. The AGM is held either in February or March and the ABM is held between September and October.<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/organisation/ip-100_04e_ifab_9481.pdf Form & Function] FIFA - FIFA paper on the role of the IFAB</ref> In cases of necessity, the Board can meet in a Special Meeting in addition to the two ordinary annual meetings. As of December 2012, the last Special Meeting was hosted by FIFA in Zurich on 5 July 2012.<ref>https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/ifab/01/65/91/74/03_07_2012_ifab_meeting_agenda.pdf</ref>

The decisions of each year's Annual General Meeting of the Board regarding changes to the Laws of the Game enter into force from 1 July (and are binding on FIFA and on the other members of the Board, and, given that FIFA's Statutes establish that FIFA and its member associations and affiliates adhere to the Laws of the Game laid down by IFAB, those changes bind also FIFA's other member associations, FIFA's continental confederations of member associations, and the subnational entities of the national associations) but confederations, member associations and other bodies whose current season has not ended by 1 July may delay the introduction of the adopted alterations to the Laws of the Game in their competitions until the beginning of their next season.<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/statutes.html FIFA Statutes] FIFA</ref> As well as permanent changes to the Laws, IFAB also authorises trials of potential amendments.<ref name=\"videotrials\">{{cite news|last1=Gibson|first1=Owen|title=Football’s lawmakers approve live trials for video technology to aid referees|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/05/football-live-trials-video-technology-referees-gianni-infantino|accessdate=7 June 2016|work=The Observer|date=5 March 2016}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:1903 Laws of the Game.pdf|thumb|right|The Laws of the Game in 1903]]
Though the rules of football had largely been standardised by the early 1880s, the UK's four football associations still each had slightly different rules. This posed a problem with international matches and when matches were played, the rules of the home team's national association were used. While this solution was workable, it was hardly ideal. To remedy this, the then football associations of [[The Football Association|England]], [[Football Association of Wales|Wales]], [[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]] and [[Irish Football Association|Ireland]] met at the [[International Football Conference]] on 6 December 1882 in [[Manchester]], in order to set forth a common set of rules that could be applied to matches between the UK football associations' national teams.  

In the summer of 1885, the English FA legalized professionalism.  The Scottish FA responded that it would refuse to allow professionals in its own national team, and would refuse to play international matches against an England team containing professionals.<ref>{{cite journal |work=Nottingham Journal |date=1886-01-27 |page=6 |title=The International Match: England v Scotland}}</ref>  The Irish FA attempted to mediate by proposing that \"an international conference should be held each year, say, in August, to be called in turn by each national association to deal with the laws of the game, and discuss other matters of interest to Association football, and at which international disputes could be adjusted\".<ref>{{cite journal |work=Cricket and Football Field |date=1886-02-13 |page=12 |title=Scottish Football Association}}</ref>

The first meeting of IFAB took place at the FA's offices at [[Holborn Viaduct]] in [[London]] on Wednesday 2 June 1886.<ref>[http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1886/18861ST.pdf The First Meeting of the International Football Association Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007012127/http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1886/18861ST.pdf |date=2007-10-07 }} Soccer South Bay Referee Association</ref><ref>[http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/TheOrganisation/Postings/2004/03/HISTORY_OF_THE_FA.htm TheFA.com - History of The FA] Football Association</ref> The FA, SFA, FAW and IFA each had equal voting rights.

[[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)]], the international [[sport governing body|organising body]] for the sport, was formed in [[Paris]] in 1904 and declared that, regarding the Laws of the Game itself, they would enforce the rules laid down by IFAB.  In 1912, FIFA requested that its representatives be included in IFAB. At a special meeting held in January 1913 in [[Wrexham]], IFAB agreed to FIFA's request.  The first regular IFAB meeting to include FIFA occurred in June 1913.  Each association (including FIFA) was entitled to send two representatives, with a four-fifths majority required to change the laws (thus that the UK associations could still change the laws against FIFA's wishes if they all voted together).  One more meeting of IFAB was held, in [[Paris]] in 1914, before regular meetings were curtailed by the [[First World War]].

For the first four post-war IFAB meetings (1920, 1921, 1922, and 1923), FIFA was once again excluded, on account of a dispute between FIFA and the home nations.  From 1924, once the dispute had been resolved, FIFA once again attended IFAB  meetings. In 1958, the Board agreed on its current voting system.

Since Irish partition in 1921, the IFA has evolved to become the organising body for football in Northern Ireland, with football in the [[Republic of Ireland]] being organised by the [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]].  A request for the FAI to become a member of IFAB was denied at the 1923 annual general meeting.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1923min.pdf |title=Minutes of the 1923 Annual General Meeting |page=5 |accessdate=2019-01-16}}</ref>

The '''International Football Association Board''' ('''IFAB''') is the body that determines the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] of [[association football]]. IFAB was founded in 1886 to agree standardised Laws for international competition, and has since acted as the \"guardian\" of the internationally used Laws. Since its establishment in 1904, [[Fédération Internationale de Football Association|FIFA]], the sport's top governing body, has recognised IFAB's jurisdiction over the Laws.<ref name=\"Dunmore2011\">{{cite book|author=Tom Dunmore|title=Historical Dictionary of Soccer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9j1wbp2t1usC&pg=PA150|date=16 September 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7188-5|pages=150–}}</ref> IFAB is known to take a highly conservative attitude regarding changes to the Laws of the Game.<ref name=tele_sinbin>{{cite news|title=Sin-bins will by considered by Fifa rulemakers Ifab after support from Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/10568924/Sin-bins-will-by-considered-by-Fifa-rulemakers-Ifab-after-support-from-Sepp-Blatter-and-Michel-Platini.html|accessdate=6 October 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=13 January 2014}}</ref>

It is a separate body from FIFA, though FIFA is represented on the board and holds 50% of the voting power. As a legacy of association football's origins in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], the other organisations represented are the governing bodies of the game in the four [[countries of the United Kingdom|countries of the UK]]. Amendments to the Laws require a three-quarter [[supermajority]] vote, meaning that FIFA's support is necessary but not sufficient for a motion to pass.

==Operations==
IFAB is made up of representatives from each of the United Kingdom's pioneering football associations—England's [[The Football Association|Football Association]] (The FA), the [[Scottish Football Association]] (SFA), the [[Football Association of Wales]] (FAW) and Northern Ireland's [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA)—and the [[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA), the international governing body for football. Each British association has one vote and FIFA has four. IFAB deliberations must be approved by three-quarters of the vote, or at least six of the eight votes.<ref name=\"IFAB Article 7\">{{cite web|url=http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/63/IFAB_Statutes_v2.0.pdf |title=Article 7: General Assembly |work=Statutes of the International Association Football Board (IFAB) |date=5 March 2016 |accessdate=21 July 2016}}</ref> Thus, FIFA's approval is necessary for any IFAB decision, but FIFA alone cannot change the Laws of the Game—they need to be agreed by at least two of the UK members. As of 2016, all members must be present for a binding vote to proceed.<ref name=\"IFAB Article 7\"/>

The Board meets twice a year, once to decide on possible changes to the rules governing the game of Football (the Annual General Meeting (AGM)) and once to deliberate on its internal affairs (the Annual Business Meeting (ABM)). In [[FIFA World Cup]] years, the AGM is held at FIFA's offices; otherwise, it rotates between Northern Ireland, Wales, England and Scotland in that order.<ref name=\"IFAB Article 7\"/> Four weeks before the AGM, the member associations must send their written proposals to the secretary of the host association. FIFA then prints a list of suggestions that are distributed to all other associations for examination. The AGM is held either in February or March and the ABM is held between September and October.<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/organisation/ip-100_04e_ifab_9481.pdf Form & Function] FIFA - FIFA paper on the role of the IFAB</ref> In cases of necessity, the Board can meet in a Special Meeting in addition to the two ordinary annual meetings. As of December 2012, the last Special Meeting was hosted by FIFA in Zurich on 5 July 2012.<ref>https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/ifab/01/65/91/74/03_07_2012_ifab_meeting_agenda.pdf</ref>

The decisions of each year's Annual General Meeting of the Board regarding changes to the Laws of the Game enter into force from 1 July (and are binding on FIFA and on the other members of the Board, and, given that FIFA's Statutes establish that FIFA and its member associations and affiliates adhere to the Laws of the Game laid down by IFAB, those changes bind also FIFA's other member associations, FIFA's continental confederations of member associations, and the subnational entities of the national associations) but confederations, member associations and other bodies whose current season has not ended by 1 July may delay the introduction of the adopted alterations to the Laws of the Game in their competitions until the beginning of their next season.<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/statutes.html FIFA Statutes] FIFA</ref> As well as permanent changes to the Laws, IFAB also authorises trials of potential amendments.<ref name=\"videotrials\">{{cite news|last1=Gibson|first1=Owen|title=Football’s lawmakers approve live trials for video technology to aid referees|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/05/football-live-trials-video-technology-referees-gianni-infantino|accessdate=7 June 2016|work=The Observer|date=5 March 2016}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:1903 Laws of the Game.pdf|thumb|right|The Laws of the Game in 1903]]
Though the rules of football had largely been standardised by the early 1880s, the UK's four football associations still each had slightly different rules. This posed a problem with international matches and when matches were played, the rules of the home team's national association were used. While this solution was workable, it was hardly ideal. To remedy this, the then football associations of [[The Football Association|England]], [[Football Association of Wales|Wales]], [[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]] and [[Irish Football Association|Ireland]] met at the [[International Football Conference]] on 6 December 1882 in [[Manchester]], in order to set forth a common set of rules that could be applied to matches between the UK football associations' national teams.  

In the summer of 1885, the English FA legalized professionalism.  The Scottish FA responded that it would refuse to allow professionals in its own national team, and would refuse to play international matches against an England team containing professionals.<ref>{{cite journal |work=Nottingham Journal |date=1886-01-27 |page=6 |title=The International Match: England v Scotland}}</ref>  The Irish FA attempted to mediate by proposing that \"an international conference should be held each year, say, in August, to be called in turn by each national association to deal with the laws of the game, and discuss other matters of interest to Association football, and at which international disputes could be adjusted\".<ref>{{cite journal |work=Cricket and Football Field |date=1886-02-13 |page=12 |title=Scottish Football Association}}</ref>

The first meeting of IFAB took place at the FA's offices at [[Holborn Viaduct]] in [[London]] on Wednesday 2 June 1886.<ref>[http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1886/18861ST.pdf The First Meeting of the International Football Association Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007012127/http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1886/18861ST.pdf |date=2007-10-07 }} Soccer South Bay Referee Association</ref><ref>[http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/TheOrganisation/Postings/2004/03/HISTORY_OF_THE_FA.htm TheFA.com - History of The FA] Football Association</ref> The FA, SFA, FAW and IFA each had equal voting rights.

[[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)]], the international [[sport governing body|organising body]] for the sport, was formed in [[Paris]] in 1904 and declared that, regarding the Laws of the Game itself, they would enforce the rules laid down by IFAB.  In 1912, FIFA requested that its representatives be included in IFAB. At a special meeting held in January 1913 in [[Wrexham]], IFAB agreed to FIFA's request.  The first regular IFAB meeting to include FIFA occurred in June 1913.  Each association (including FIFA) was entitled to send two representatives, with a four-fifths majority required to change the laws (thus that the UK associations could still change the laws against FIFA's wishes if they all voted together).  One more meeting of IFAB was held, in [[Paris]] in 1914, before regular meetings were curtailed by the [[First World War]].

For the first four post-war IFAB meetings (1920, 1921, 1922, and 1923), FIFA was once again excluded, on account of a dispute between FIFA and the home nations.  From 1924, once the dispute had been resolved, FIFA once again attended IFAB  meetings. In 1958, the Board agreed on its current voting system.

Since Irish partition in 1921, the IFA has evolved to become the organising body for football in Northern Ireland, with football in the [[Republic of Ireland]] being organised by the [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]].  A request for the FAI to become a member of IFAB was denied at the 1923 annual general meeting.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1923min.pdf |title=Minutes of the 1923 Annual General Meeting |page=5 |accessdate=2019-01-16}}</ref>

[[File:CI boardwalk Sandy sweepers jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Volunteer]]ing is an important type of civic engagement. Pictured are volunteers cleaning up after the 2012 [[Hurricane Sandy]].]]
'''Civic engagement''' or '''civic participation''' is any individual or group activity addressing issues of [[public]] concern.<ref>Delli, Michael. [http://www.apa.org/education/undergrad/civic-engagement.aspx \"Civic Engagement\"].''APA.Org''. American Psychological Association, n.d. Web. 25 Apr. 2016.</ref> [[Citizen]]s acting alone or together to protect public values or make a change or difference in the community are common types of civic engagement. Civic
engagement includes communities working together in both political and non-political actions. The goal of civic engagement is to address public concerns and promote the quality of the community.

Civic engagement \"is a process in which people take collective action to address issues of public concern\" and is absolutely \"instrumental to [[democracy]]\" (Checkoway & Aldana, 2012).<ref>Checkoway, B., & Aldana, A. (2013). Four forms of youth civic engagement for diverse democracy. Children and Youth Services Review, 35(11), 1894–1899. {{doi|10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.09.005}}</ref> Underrepresentation of groups in the government causes issues faced by groups such as minority, low-income, and younger groups to be overlooked or ignored. In turn, issues for higher voting groups are addressed more frequently causing more bills to be passed to fix these problems (Griffin & Newman, 2008). <ref>Griffin, J., Newman, B., & Ebooks Corporation. (2008). Minority report: Evaluating political equality in America (Ebook Library (EBL) (DDA)). Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref> 

Civic engagement helps the \"emergence of diversity democracy\", which is defined as a way to \"influence agency decisions\" from ways besides  voting (Checkoway & Aldana, 2013). <ref>Checkoway, B., & Aldana, A. (2013). Four forms of youth civic engagement for diverse democracy. Children and Youth Services Review, 35(11), 1894–1899. {{doi|10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.09.005}}</ref> An informed voter is beneficial for a democracy and the only way for this to occur is through education. One potential solution is to create a mandatory training course for younger voters to learn of the opportunities with civic engagement. Additionally historically lower voter turnout groups may lack basic resources to understand how to register to vote or even how to get to voting locations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/college/collegespecial2/coll_aascu_defi.html|title=The Definition of Civic Engagement|date=2003-07-07|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref>

==Forms==
Civic engagement can take many forms—from individual [[volunteerism]], community engagement efforts, organizational involvement and government work such as electoral participation. These engagements may include directly addressing a problem through personal work, community based, or work through the institutions of [[representative democracy]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ekman | first1 = Joakim | last2 = Amnå | first2 = Erik | title = Political participation and civic engagement: towards a new typology | journal = [[Human Affairs]] | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 283–300 | doi = 10.2478/s13374-012-0024-1 | date = June 2012 | ref = harv | url = http://oru.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:517176/FULLTEXT01 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Many individuals feel a sense personal responsibility to actively engage as a sense of obligation to their community. \"Youth civic engagement\" has similar aims to develop the community environment and cultivate relationships, although youth civic engagement places an emphasis on empowering youth.

A study published by the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning & Engagement at [[Tufts University]], divided civic engagement into three categories: civic, electoral, and political voice.<ref name=\"Keeter2002\">{{Cite web

A Civic Engagement reform arose at the beginning of the 21st Century after [[Robert Putnam]]'s provocative book, [[Bowling Alone]], brought to light changes in civic participation patterns. Putnam argued that despite rapid increases in higher education opportunities that may foster civic engagement, Americans were dropping out of political and organized community life. A number of studies suggested that while more youth are volunteering, fewer are voting or becoming politically engaged.<ref>Putnam, R. (2000). ''Bowling Alone.'' Simon and Schuster: New York. p. 64.</ref>

==Role of volunteerism in transforming governance==

The State of the World's [[Volunteerism]] Report 2015, the first global review of the power of volunteer voices to help improve the way people are governed, draws on evidence from countries as diverse as Brazil, Kenya, Lebanon and Bangladesh. The [[UN]] report shows how ordinary people are volunteering their time, energies and skills to improve the way they are governed and engaged at local, national and global levels. Better governance at every level is a pre-requisite for the success of the new set of targets for future international development, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], which has been agreed upon by the United Nations in September 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}</ref>

At the global level, for instance, a diverse group of 37 [[Online volunteering|online volunteers]] from across the globe engaged in 4 months of intense collaboration with the [[United Nations Department of Economic Affairs]] (UN DESA) to process 386 research surveys carried out across 193 UN Member States for the 2014 UN [[E-Government]] Survey. The diversity of nationalities and languages of the online volunteers<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onlinevolunteering.org/en/org/stories/2013_undesa.html|title=Home - UNV Online Volunteering service}}</ref>—more than 65 languages, 15 nationalities, of which half are from developing countries—mirrors perfectly the mission of the survey.

== Benefits ==

Civic engagement can foster [[community]] participation and government involvement.

According to ICMA: Leaders at the Core of Better Communities, these are the benefits of civic engagement:<ref>\"How Civic Engagement Transforms Community Relationships.\" ''How Civic Engagement Transforms Community Relationships'' 43 (2011): n.p. Web. 25 Apr. 2016.</ref>

* Achieving greater buy-in to decisions with fewer backlashes such as lawsuits, special elections, or a council recall.
* Engendering trust between citizens and government, which improves public behavior at council meetings. 
* Attaining successful outcomes on toxic issues, which helps elected officials avoid choosing between equally unappealing solutions. 
* Developing better and more creative ideas and solutions. 
* Implementing ideas, programs, and [[policies]] faster and more easily. 
* Creating involved citizens instead of demanding customers. 
* Building community within a city. 
* Making your job easier and more relaxing.

== Local civic engagement ==
When those who serve listen to the citizens, they become better informed of what is needed by the community and generally make better decisions.  Miriam Porter states that elected officials should communicate with their citizens to have this better understanding, \"Without this, turmoil, suspicion, and reduction of public trust ensues\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=25038780&site=eds-live&scope=site|title=EBSCOhost Login}}</ref>

Volunteering personal time to community projects is widely believed to support the growth of a community as a whole. [[Community engagement]] could be found at: Food pantries, community clean-up programs and the like can bolster efforts to create a strong community bond.

===Community collaboration===
Community [[collaboration]] includes democratic spaces where people are open to discuss concerns for particular issues regarding [[public interest]] and means to make the changes necessary. These spaces are often resource centers, such as neighborhood associations or school boards where citizens can obtain information regarding the community (upcoming changes, proposed solutions to existing problems, etc.).
Colleges and universities are also offering more opportunities and expecting more students to engage in community volunteer work.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Flanagan|first1=Constance|last2=Levine|first2=Peter|title=Civic Engagement and the Transition to Adulthood|journal=The Future of Children|date=Spring 2010|volume=20|issue=1|pages=159–79|pmid=20364626|doi=10.1353/foc.0.0043}}</ref>

According to a case study conducted in a U.S college on September 2014, there are pivotal leadership qualities that contribute to the development of civic engagement. The study mentions 3 main themes: active, adaptive and resilient leadership, learning for leadership and engagement for the greater good as the main reasons for the success of The Democracy Commitment (TDC) in the college. TDC is a national initiative that intend to help U.S community colleges educate their students for democracy. <ref>Clifford P. Harbour. (2016). Civic Engagement and Cosmopolitan Leadership. En Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement (51–59). Estados Unidos: Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</ref>

Political participation is another key element that is practiced with regularity. Involvement in public council meeting sessions for discussions informs citizens of necessities and changes that need to be made. Casting an informed vote at the local level, can change many things that affect day-to-day life.

Online engagement gives citizens the opportunity to be involved in their [[local government]] that they would not have otherwise, by allowing them to voice themselves from the comfort of their own home. Online Engagement involves things such as online voting and public discussion forums that give citizens the opportunity to voice their opinions on topics and offer solutions as well as find others with common interests and creating the possibility of forming [[advocacy group]]s pertaining to particular interests. The use of the internet has allowed for people to have access to information easily and has resulted in a better informed public as well as creating a new sense of community for citizens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Engaging the Public at a Local Level to Strengthen Civic Engagement|url=http://www.saafdn.org/document.doc?id=677|publisher=San Antonio Area Foundation|accessdate=4 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416191630/http://www.saafdn.org/document.doc?id=677|archive-date=16 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==In the role of state government==
Civic engagement has an interrelated relationship within the various entities of the state. Through the values, knowledge, liberties, skills, ideas, attitudes and beliefs the population holds, civic engagement cultivates and shapes the state to be a representation of vast cultural, social, and economic identities.

Civic engagement applied within the state is not possible without local civic engagement. As in a democratic society, citizens are the source to give life to a representative democracy. Application of this principle can be found within programs and laws that states have implemented based in a variety of areas concerns for that particular state. Health, education, equality, immigration are a few examples of entities that civic engagement can shape within a state.

===Application in health===
States implement public health programs to better benefit the needs of the society. The State Child Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), for example, is the largest public investment in child health care aiding over 11 million uninsured children in the United States. \"This statewide health insurance program for low-income children was associated with improved access, utilization, and quality of care, suggesting that SCHIP has the potential to improve health care for low-income American children\".<ref>Szilagyi, Peter G., et al. \"Evaluation of a state health insurance program for low-income children: implications for state child health insurance programs.\" ''Pediatrics'' 105.2 (2000): 363–71</ref> States take part in the program and sculpt it to better fit the needs of that state's demographics, making their healthcare and the civic engagement process of individuals that take part in the program as well help reform and fix it apart of the state's identity.

===In comparison with other countries===
States practicing public involvement and implementing public health programs to better benefit the needs of the society is a concept that is also shared by other countries, such as England. A study conducted by Department of Primary Care, University of Liverpool, the Department of Social Medicine, University of Bristol,  the Department of Geography and Geology, McMaster Institute of Environment and Health, McMaster University, Avon Health Authority, the School of Journalism, Tom Hopkinson Centre for Media Research, Media and Cultural Studies, Cardiff University, and the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Centre for Health Economics and Policy Analysis, McMaster University stated that \"There are a number of impulses towards public participation in health care decision making including instrumentalist, communitarian, educative and expressive impulses and the desire for increased accountability\".<ref name=\"Litva, Andrea 2002\">Litva, Andrea, et al. \"'The public is too subjective': public involvement at different levels of health-care decision making.\" ''Social Science & Medicine'' 54.12 (2002): 1825–37.</ref>

Their research included critical examination of the degree of involvement by the public in healthcare decision making. It is suggested that \"public participation in decision making can promote goals, bind individuals or groups together, impart a sense of competence and responsibility and help express political or civic identity\".<ref name=\"Litva, Andrea 2002\" /> The action of the citizens aimed at influencing decisions of representatives ultimately affects the state as a whole. Voting is a key component in civic engagement for the voice of the masses to be heard.

===Importance of voter turnout===
[[File:I voted on November 8 2016.jpg|thumb|Voter turn out sticker]]
The goal for state government in elections is to promote civic engagement.  Director Regina Lawrence of Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life states \"Politics and all other forms of engagement are really about trying to make your community, your state, and your nation a better place to live.\"<ref>Andrew Roush,  N.p.. Web. 3 Dec 2013. <http://alcalde.texasexes.org/2013/06/texas-ranks-low-for-civic-participation-infographic/>.</ref>
Voter Turnout ensures civic engagement among the state with incentives that promises volunteer organizations, charity, and political involvement with everyone in the community who will have a voice to be heard.

The state can help promote civic engagement by ensuring fair voter and redistricting processes; by building partnerships among government agencies, non-profit organizations, and private citizens; and by maintaining networks of information about volunteer and charitable opportunities.<ref name=\"vaperforms.virginia.gov\"/>

One of the main factors that determine civic engagement among the people is voter turnout. Voter turnout gauges citizens' level of political involvement, an important component of civic engagement—and a prerequisite for maintaining public accountability.<ref name=\"vaperforms.virginia.gov\"/>

====Example of high voter turnout====

* The state can help promote civic engagement by ensuring fair voter and redistricting processes; by building partnerships among government agencies, non-profit organizations, and private citizens; and by maintaining networks of information about volunteer and charitable opportunities.<ref name=\"vaperforms.virginia.gov\">[http://vaperforms.virginia.gov/indicators/govtcitizens/civicEngagement.php \"Civic Engagement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630070117/http://vaperforms.virginia.gov/indicators/govtCitizens/civicEngagement.php |date=2015-06-30 }}. Retrieved 3 December 2013.</ref>
* Access to information about government activities, decision-making, solicit and use public input, and encourage public employees to donate and serve.<ref name=\"vaperforms.virginia.gov\"/>

====Example of low voter turnout====

According to Merriam-Webster, marginalized is defined as \"to put or keep (someone) in a powerless or unimportant position within a society or group\".<ref>\"Marginalized.\" Merriam-Webster.com. 2016. <nowiki>http://www.merriam-webster.com</nowiki> (12 April 2016).</ref> In diverse communities it is perceived that awareness and participation according to a study, using three different types of community service for the interaction between diverse individuals and understanding each other's perspective and enhancing relationships within the community.<ref>Hoffman, August John, Julie Wallach, and Eduardo Sanchez. \"Community Service Work, Civic Engagement, And 'Giving Back' To Society: Key Factors In Improving Interethnic Relationships And Achieving 'Connectedness' In Ethnically Diverse Communities.\" ''Australian Social Work'' 63.4 (2010): 418–30. SocINDEX with Full Text. Web. 12 Apr. 2016.</ref> In addition, specifically Black Youth, there is an underlying gap of early civic education where there is lack of and where it thrives. According to Hope and Jagers, they studied civic engagement among Black youth using data acquired from the Youth Culture Survey from the Black Youth Project. The assumption is that Black youth who experience racial discrimination are fueled to be aware and participate in politics.<ref>Hope, Elan C., and Robert J. Jagers. \"The Role Of Sociopolitical Attitudes And Civic Education In The Civic Engagement Of Black Youth.\" ''Journal of Research on Adolescence (Wiley-Blackwell)'' 24.3 (2014): 460–70. ''Professional Development Collection''. Web. 11 Apr. 2016.</ref>

Another study by Chan describes the effect of the association of development and environmental factors among a group of at-risk youth such as African-Americans and Latino participants who come from low-income families that dwell in inner-city neighborhoods. Their research resulted in variations according to their participants as the racial minority youth were motivated and had aspiring goals for their futures due to early participation in civic engagement activities, but there was no sufficient evidence that this type of mindset will follow them into their adulthood.<ref>Chan, Wing, Suh-Ruu Ou, and Arthur Reynolds. \"Adolescent Civic Engagement And Adult Outcomes: An Examination Among Urban Racial Minorities.\" ''Journal of Youth & Adolescence'' 43.11 (2014): 1829–43  ''CINAHL Complete''. Web. 11 Apr. 2016.</ref> Looking into another oppressed group, Latinos, according to this report in the New York Times, states between 2000 and 2012 the number of Hispanics eligible to vote increased to an estimate of 10 million, but there is a lack of taking an active approach towards dealing with the issues such as immigration and causing a stir within the Latino community. The Hispanic demographic is becoming a potential influence of power within political polls.<ref>Suro, Roberto. \"Whatever Happened to Latino Political Power?\" ''The New York Times''. 2 January 2016. Web. 12 April 2016.</ref> To expand on another group that are oppressed is immigrant parents and their children in Jensen's study their concentration is on Asia and Latin America. In their study they sampled a small group from a metropolitan area, the difference between both generations varies as the children who were in high school which is 87.5% were stated to be civically engaged. Whereas for the parents they were not civically engaged in issues but developed \"bilcultural consciousness\" such as sending money back their original country of origin and these participants saw it as their duty in their current state of opportunity to be civically engaged.<ref>Jensen, Lene Arnett. \"Immigrants' Cultural Identities As Sources Of Civic Engagement.\" ''Applied Developmental Science'' 12.2 (2008): 74–83.

== Technology ==

'''Civic engagement, interpersonal trust, and television use''' – [[Social capital]] has been on the decline for years and Putnam looked into why this is. One of the areas the study covered was television and its effects on social and civic engagements. Shah writes that Putnam found the more TV a person watches, the less they are active in outside activities. This is shown with the rise of TV in the 60s and the fall of civic engagements. They found that though news and educational programming can actually aide in a citizen's knowledge, but the lack of engaging in outside activities and social events hurts civic engagement in general.<ref>Shah, D. V. (1998). \"Civic Engagement, Interpersonal Trust, and Television Use: An Individual‐Level Assessment of Social Capital\". ''Political Psychology'', 19(3), 469–96.</ref>

Nowadays, the internet has become the main social media outlet. Xenos and Moy found that the internet does help civic engagement but also give \"unjustifiable euphoria, abrupt and equally unjustifiable skepticism, and gradual realization that web-based human interaction really does have unique and politically significant properties\".<ref>Xenos, M., & Moy, P. (2007). \"Direct and differential effects of the Internet on political and civic engagement\". ''Journal of communication'', 57(4), 704–18.</ref>  We have all the information we want about and candidate at our fingertips, and the wealth of information is creating a more informed body. But with this comes misinformation and the two collide and do the opposite, creating a public with clashing opinions.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/digitalcitizensh0000moss|url-access=registration|quote=civic engagement technology.|title=Digital Citizenship: The Internet, Society, and Participation|last=Mossberger|first=Karen|author-link1=Karen Mossberger|last2=Tolbert|first2=Caroline J.|author-link2=Caroline Tolbert|last3=McNeal|first3=Ramona S.|date=2007-10-12|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262250191|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/>

The Knight Foundation outlines four different ways technology can assist in civic engagement. The four different ways include upgrading and providing e-services, making information more transparent, allowing e-democracy, and a service they call co-production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knightfoundation.org/articles/four-ideas-on-how-tech-can-increase-civic-engagement|title=Knight Foundation|website=www.knightfoundation.org|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref> E-services would allow digital technologies to improve the efficiency of urban services within a city. This would allow the services to become more effective as well as give the public a way to get involved. E-Democracy and Co-Production would work by allowing citizens to shape public policy by allowing them to partake in actions through technology. The Knight Foundation claims technology can make information more transparent, allowing the public to access the information and get involved.

There are countries, like Romania, where the new technologies started to influence the civic participation, in the last years. New media is becoming a factor of increasing civic mobilization for the new generations. New studies about that, at [[Center for Civic Participation and Democracy]] from [[SNSPA]], [[Romania]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://civicparticipation.ro/|title=SNSPA – Center for Civic Participation and Democracy|website=civicparticipation.ro|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-06}}</ref> [[Center for Civic Participation and Democracy]] (CPD) is a unit of research, analysis, and evaluation of citizen participation in the democratic process, both at the national and [[European Union|European]] level.Created at the [[National University of Political Studies and Public Administration|National School of Political Science and Public Administration]], CPD brings together experts in areas such as Political Science, Sociology, Administrative Sciences, Communications, International Relations and European Studies and it objectifies the SNSPA role and status of ''School of governance''.

== Role of higher education ==

It can be argued that a fundamental step in creating a functioning society begins with the civic education of children within the community.  According to Diann Cameron Kelly, \"When our young children serve their communities through volunteerism, political participation or through vocal activism, they are more likely to emerge...voting and serving all aspects of society\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Civic readiness: Preparing toddlers and young children for civic education and sustained engagement|author=Kelly, DC|journal=National Civic Review|date=Winter 2008|volume=97|issue= 4|pages=55–59|doi=10.1002/ncr.234}}</ref>   Kelly argues that children should be taught how their community works and who chooses the rules we live by even before they enter school.  Other voices maintain that civic education is a lifelong process, even for those who make decisions on behalf of the citizens they serve.

To answer this challenge, the incorporation of [[service-learning]] into collegiate course design has gained acceptance as a pedagogy that links curricular content with civic education. In a recent study, students who participated in service learning even one time appear to have made gains in knowledge of and commitment to civic engagement when compared to non-service learners.<ref>Prentice, M. & G. Robinson (2010) ''Linking Service Learning and Civic Engagement in Community College Students''. American Association of Community Colleges: Washington, D.C.</ref> [[Campus Compact]], a coalition of nearly 1200 college presidents (as of 2013) promotes the development of citizenship skills by creating community partnerships and providing resources to train faculty to integrate civic and community-based learning into the curriculum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compact.org/about/history-mission-vision/|title=Mission & Vision - Campus Compact}}</ref> Building on the acceptance of service learning and civic engagement in higher education, The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement in Teaching created the Political Engagement Project in 2003 to develop the political knowledge and skills of college-aged students.<ref>McCartney, A., Bennion, E. & D. Simpson (2013). ''Teaching Civic Engagement: From Student to Active Citizen''. American Political Science Association: Washington, D.C., p. xiv.</ref> The [[American Democracy Project (AASCU initiative)|American Democracy Project]] (ADP) was launched in the same year by the [[American Association of State Colleges and Universities|American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU)]].<ref name=\"aascu.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aascu.org/programs/ADP/|title=American Democracy Project: About Us}}</ref> The American Democracy Project was joined by the American Democracy Commitment,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedemocracycommitment.org|title=Home – The Democracy Commitment}}</ref> a partnership of community colleges, to sponsor an annual national conference focused on higher education's role in preparing the next generation of informed, engaged citizens. The American Democracy Project also sponsors campus-based initiatives including voter registration, curriculum revision projects, and special days of action and reflection, such as the MLK Day of Service. In a report entitled,'' A Crucible Moment: College Learning and Democracy's Future ''issued in 2012 by the National Task Force on Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement, a joint project of the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] and the American Association of Colleges and Universities, the authors argue that higher education must serve as an intellectual incubator and socially responsible partner in advancing civic learning and democratic engagement.

'''The report recommends four basic steps to build civic minded institutions:'''

# Foster a civic ethos across the campus culture.
# Make civic literacy a core expectation for all students.
# Practice civic inquiry across all fields of study.
# Advance civic action through transformative partnerships.<ref>The National Task Force of Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement. 2012. ''A Crucible Moment: College Learning and Democracy's Future.''  Washington, DC: American Association of Colleges and Universities.</ref>

These higher education-based initiatives endeavor to build in college students, a politically engaged identity while enhancing the capacity to evaluate the political landscape and make informed decisions about participation in our democracy.<ref>Colby, A., Beaumont, E., Ehrlich, T, & J. Corngold. (2007) ''Educating for Democracy: Preparing Undergraduates for Responsible Political Engagement''. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Jossey-Bass: San Francisco. pp. 16–17.</ref> As evidenced by the growth in coalitions, professional development opportunities and civic education research, institutions of higher education and their association partners are committed to help prepare the next generation of citizens to become tomorrow's \"Stewards of Place\".<ref name=\"aascu.org\"/>

Many universities, like the University of Minnesota, have begun to focus on increasing the civic engagement of students and have mandated that educators begin incorporating it into several school activities. Edwin Fogelman, author of ''Civic Engagement at the University of Minnesota,'' states that true civic engagement can only be practiced by those living within a Democracy. According to Fogelman, civic engagement is largely shaped by schools. Education institutions have the skills to foster \"civic competence, critical thinking, and Public Spirit, which empower citizens to become engaged\". Many claim that civic engagement ought to become part of the curriculum and that higher education institutions should provide opportunities to become engaged such as internships, service-learning, and community based activities. Institutions also need to provide outlets where students can have open discussions over concerns and controversial issues.<ref>Fogelman, Edwin. \"Civic Engagement At The University Of Minnesota.\" ''Journal of Public Affairs'' 6.(2002): 103. ''Academic Search Complete''. Web. 13 Apr. 2016.</ref>

Some schools such as [[Widener University]], have made civic engagement a core goal of the university. The university strives to get students involved in the local community to become more aware and civically engaged.

===Civic learning===

In January 2012, the U.S. Department of Education issued a road map and a call to action entitled ''Advancing Civic Learning and Engagement in Democracy '' that offers nine steps to enhancing the Department of Education's commitment to civic learning and engagement in democracy.

'''These steps include:'''

# Convene and catalyze schools and post-secondary institutions to increase and enhance high-quality civic learning and engagement
# Identify additional civic indicators.
# Identify promising practices in civic learning and democratic engagement—and encourage further research to learn what works.
# Leverage federal investments and public-private partnerships.
# Encourage community-based work-study placements.
# Encourage public service careers among college students and graduates.
# Support civic learning for a well-rounded K–12 curriculum.
# Engage Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority-Serving Institutions—including Hispanic Serving Institutions, Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander–Serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges and Universities-in a national dialogue to identify best practices.
# Highlight and promote student and family participation in education programs and policies at the federal and local levels.\"<ref>U.S. Department of Education, Office of the Under Secretary and Office of Postsecondary Education, Advancing Civic Learning and Engagement in Democracy: A Road Map and Call to Action, Washington, D.C., 2012. pp. 22–26.</ref>

[[File:CI boardwalk Sandy sweepers jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Volunteer]]ing is an important type of civic engagement. Pictured are volunteers cleaning up after the 2012 [[Hurricane Sandy]].]]
'''Civic engagement''' or '''civic participation''' is any individual or group activity addressing issues of [[public]] concern.<ref>Delli, Michael. [http://www.apa.org/education/undergrad/civic-engagement.aspx \"Civic Engagement\"].''APA.Org''. American Psychological Association, n.d. Web. 25 Apr. 2016.</ref> [[Citizen]]s acting alone or together to protect public values or make a change or difference in the community are common types of civic engagement. Civic
engagement includes communities working together in both political and non-political actions. The goal of civic engagement is to address public concerns and promote the quality of the community.

Civic engagement “is a process in which people take collective action to address issues of public concern” and is absolutely “instrumental to [[democracy]]” (Checkoway & Aldana, 2012).<ref>Checkoway, B., & Aldana, A. (2013). Four forms of youth civic engagement for diverse democracy. Children and Youth Services Review, 35(11), 1894–1899. {{doi|10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.09.005}}</ref> Underrepresentation of groups in the government causes issues faced by groups such as minority, low-income, and younger groups to be overlooked or ignored. In turn, issues for higher voting groups are addressed more frequently causing more bills to be passed to fix these problems (Griffin & Newman, 2008). <ref>Griffin, J., Newman, B., & Ebooks Corporation. (2008). Minority report: Evaluating political equality in America (Ebook Library (EBL) (DDA)). Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref> 

Civic engagement helps the “emergence of diversity democracy”, which is defined as a way to “influence agency decisions” from ways besides  voting (Checkoway & Aldana, 2013). <ref>Checkoway, B., & Aldana, A. (2013). Four forms of youth civic engagement for diverse democracy. Children and Youth Services Review, 35(11), 1894–1899. {{doi|10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.09.005}}</ref> An informed voter is beneficial for a democracy and the only way for this to occur is through education. One potential solution is to create a mandatory training course for younger voters to learn of the opportunities with civic engagement. Additionally historically lower voter turnout groups may lack basic resources to understand how to register to vote or even how to get to voting locations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/college/collegespecial2/coll_aascu_defi.html|title=The Definition of Civic Engagement|date=2003-07-07|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref>

==Forms==
Civic engagement can take many forms—from individual [[volunteerism]], community engagement efforts, organizational involvement and government work such as electoral participation. These engagements may include directly addressing a problem through personal work, community based, or work through the institutions of [[representative democracy]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ekman | first1 = Joakim | last2 = Amnå | first2 = Erik | title = Political participation and civic engagement: towards a new typology | journal = [[Human Affairs]] | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 283–300 | doi = 10.2478/s13374-012-0024-1 | date = June 2012 | ref = harv | url = http://oru.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:517176/FULLTEXT01 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Many individuals feel a sense personal responsibility to actively engage as a sense of obligation to their community. \"Youth civic engagement\" has similar aims to develop the community environment and cultivate relationships, although youth civic engagement places an emphasis on empowering youth.

A Civic Engagement reform arose at the beginning of the 21st Century after [[Robert Putnam]]'s provocative book, [[Bowling Alone]], brought to light changes in civic participation patterns. Putnam argued that despite rapid increases in higher education opportunities that may foster civic engagement, Americans were dropping out of political and organized community life. A number of studies suggested that while more youth are volunteering, fewer are voting or becoming politically engaged.<ref>Putnam, R. (2000). ''Bowling Alone.'' Simon and Schuster: New York. p. 64.</ref>

==Role of volunteerism in transforming governance==

The State of the World's [[Volunteerism]] Report 2015, the first global review of the power of volunteer voices to help improve the way people are governed, draws on evidence from countries as diverse as Brazil, Kenya, Lebanon and Bangladesh. The [[UN]] report shows how ordinary people are volunteering their time, energies and skills to improve the way they are governed and engaged at local, national and global levels. Better governance at every level is a pre-requisite for the success of the new set of targets for future international development, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], which has been agreed upon by the United Nations in September 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}</ref>

At the global level, for instance, a diverse group of 37 [[Online volunteering|online volunteers]] from across the globe engaged in 4 months of intense collaboration with the [[United Nations Department of Economic Affairs]] (UN DESA) to process 386 research surveys carried out across 193 UN Member States for the 2014 UN [[E-Government]] Survey. The diversity of nationalities and languages of the online volunteers<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onlinevolunteering.org/en/org/stories/2013_undesa.html|title=Home - UNV Online Volunteering service}}</ref>—more than 65 languages, 15 nationalities, of which half are from developing countries—mirrors perfectly the mission of the survey.

== Benefits ==

Civic engagement can foster [[community]] participation and government involvement.

According to ICMA: Leaders at the Core of Better Communities, these are the benefits of civic engagement:<ref>\"How Civic Engagement Transforms Community Relationships.\" ''How Civic Engagement Transforms Community Relationships'' 43 (2011): n.p. Web. 25 Apr. 2016.</ref>

* Achieving greater buy-in to decisions with fewer backlashes such as lawsuits, special elections, or a council recall.
* Engendering trust between citizens and government, which improves public behavior at council meetings. 
* Attaining successful outcomes on toxic issues, which helps elected officials avoid choosing between equally unappealing solutions. 
* Developing better and more creative ideas and solutions. 
* Implementing ideas, programs, and [[policies]] faster and more easily. 
* Creating involved citizens instead of demanding customers. 
* Building community within a city. 
* Making your job easier and more relaxing.

== Local civic engagement ==
When those who serve listen to the citizens, they become better informed of what is needed by the community and generally make better decisions.  Miriam Porter states that elected officials should communicate with their citizens to have this better understanding, \"Without this, turmoil, suspicion, and reduction of public trust ensues\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=25038780&site=eds-live&scope=site|title=EBSCOhost Login}}</ref>

Volunteering personal time to community projects is widely believed to support the growth of a community as a whole. [[Community engagement]] could be found at: Food pantries, community clean-up programs and the like can bolster efforts to create a strong community bond.

===Community collaboration===
Community [[collaboration]] includes democratic spaces where people are open to discuss concerns for particular issues regarding [[public interest]] and means to make the changes necessary. These spaces are often resource centers, such as neighborhood associations or school boards where citizens can obtain information regarding the community (upcoming changes, proposed solutions to existing problems, etc.).
Colleges and universities are also offering more opportunities and expecting more students to engage in community volunteer work.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Flanagan|first1=Constance|last2=Levine|first2=Peter|title=Civic Engagement and the Transition to Adulthood|journal=The Future of Children|date=Spring 2010|volume=20|issue=1|pages=159–79|pmid=20364626|doi=10.1353/foc.0.0043}}</ref>

According to a case study conducted in a U.S college on September 2014, there are pivotal leadership qualities that contribute to the development of civic engagement. The study mentions 3 main themes: active, adaptive and resilient leadership, learning for leadership and engagement for the greater good as the main reasons for the success of The Democracy Commitment (TDC) in the college. TDC is a national initiative that intend to help U.S community colleges educate their students for democracy. <ref>Clifford P. Harbour. (2016). Civic Engagement and Cosmopolitan Leadership. En Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement (51–59). Estados Unidos: Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</ref>

Political participation is another key element that is practiced with regularity. Involvement in public council meeting sessions for discussions informs citizens of necessities and changes that need to be made. Casting an informed vote at the local level, can change many things that affect day-to-day life.

Online engagement gives citizens the opportunity to be involved in their [[local government]] that they would not have otherwise, by allowing them to voice themselves from the comfort of their own home. Online Engagement involves things such as online voting and public discussion forums that give citizens the opportunity to voice their opinions on topics and offer solutions as well as find others with common interests and creating the possibility of forming [[advocacy group]]s pertaining to particular interests. The use of the internet has allowed for people to have access to information easily and has resulted in a better informed public as well as creating a new sense of community for citizens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Engaging the Public at a Local Level to Strengthen Civic Engagement|url=http://www.saafdn.org/document.doc?id=677|publisher=San Antonio Area Foundation|accessdate=4 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416191630/http://www.saafdn.org/document.doc?id=677|archive-date=16 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==In the role of state government==
Civic engagement has an interrelated relationship within the various entities of the state. Through the values, knowledge, liberties, skills, ideas, attitudes and beliefs the population holds, civic engagement cultivates and shapes the state to be a representation of vast cultural, social, and economic identities.

Civic engagement applied within the state is not possible without local civic engagement. As in a democratic society, citizens are the source to give life to a representative democracy. Application of this principle can be found within programs and laws that states have implemented based in a variety of areas concerns for that particular state. Health, education, equality, immigration are a few examples of entities that civic engagement can shape within a state.

===Application in health===
States implement public health programs to better benefit the needs of the society. The State Child Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), for example, is the largest public investment in child health care aiding over 11 million uninsured children in the United States. \"This statewide health insurance program for low-income children was associated with improved access, utilization, and quality of care, suggesting that SCHIP has the potential to improve health care for low-income American children\".<ref>Szilagyi, Peter G., et al. \"Evaluation of a state health insurance program for low-income children: implications for state child health insurance programs.\" ''Pediatrics'' 105.2 (2000): 363–71</ref> States take part in the program and sculpt it to better fit the needs of that state's demographics, making their healthcare and the civic engagement process of individuals that take part in the program as well help reform and fix it apart of the state's identity.

===In comparison with other countries===
States practicing public involvement and implementing public health programs to better benefit the needs of the society is a concept that is also shared by other countries, such as England. A study conducted by Department of Primary Care, University of Liverpool, the Department of Social Medicine, University of Bristol,  the Department of Geography and Geology, McMaster Institute of Environment and Health, McMaster University, Avon Health Authority, the School of Journalism, Tom Hopkinson Centre for Media Research, Media and Cultural Studies, Cardiff University, and the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Centre for Health Economics and Policy Analysis, McMaster University stated that \"There are a number of impulses towards public participation in health care decision making including instrumentalist, communitarian, educative and expressive impulses and the desire for increased accountability\".<ref name=\"Litva, Andrea 2002\">Litva, Andrea, et al. \"'The public is too subjective': public involvement at different levels of health-care decision making.\" ''Social Science & Medicine'' 54.12 (2002): 1825–37.</ref>

Their research included critical examination of the degree of involvement by the public in healthcare decision making. It is suggested that \"public participation in decision making can promote goals, bind individuals or groups together, impart a sense of competence and responsibility and help express political or civic identity\".<ref name=\"Litva, Andrea 2002\" /> The action of the citizens aimed at influencing decisions of representatives ultimately affects the state as a whole. Voting is a key component in civic engagement for the voice of the masses to be heard.

===Importance of voter turnout===
[[File:I voted on November 8 2016.jpg|thumb|Voter turn out sticker]]
The goal for state government in elections is to promote civic engagement.  Director Regina Lawrence of Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life states \"Politics and all other forms of engagement are really about trying to make your community, your state, and your nation a better place to live.\"<ref>Andrew Roush,  N.p.. Web. 3 Dec 2013. <http://alcalde.texasexes.org/2013/06/texas-ranks-low-for-civic-participation-infographic/>.</ref>
Voter Turnout ensures civic engagement among the state with incentives that promises volunteer organizations, charity, and political involvement with everyone in the community who will have a voice to be heard.

The state can help promote civic engagement by ensuring fair voter and redistricting processes; by building partnerships among government agencies, non-profit organizations, and private citizens; and by maintaining networks of information about volunteer and charitable opportunities.<ref name=\"vaperforms.virginia.gov\"/>

One of the main factors that determine civic engagement among the people is voter turnout. Voter turnout gauges citizens' level of political involvement, an important component of civic engagement—and a prerequisite for maintaining public accountability.<ref name=\"vaperforms.virginia.gov\"/>

== In marginalized communities ==
According to Merriam-Webster, marginalized is defined as \"to put or keep (someone) in a powerless or unimportant position within a society or group\".<ref>\"Marginalized.\" Merriam-Webster.com. 2016. <nowiki>http://www.merriam-webster.com</nowiki> (12 April 2016).</ref> In diverse communities it is perceived that awareness and participation according to a study, using three different types of community service for the interaction between diverse individuals and understanding each other's perspective and enhancing relationships within the community.<ref>Hoffman, August John, Julie Wallach, and Eduardo Sanchez. \"Community Service Work, Civic Engagement, And 'Giving Back' To Society: Key Factors In Improving Interethnic Relationships And Achieving 'Connectedness' In Ethnically Diverse Communities.\" ''Australian Social Work'' 63.4 (2010): 418–30. SocINDEX with Full Text. Web. 12 Apr. 2016.</ref> In addition, specifically Black Youth, there is an underlying gap of early civic education where there is lack of and where it thrives. According to Hope and Jagers, they studied civic engagement among Black youth using data acquired from the Youth Culture Survey from the Black Youth Project. The assumption is that Black youth who experience racial discrimination are fueled to be aware and participate in politics.<ref>Hope, Elan C., and Robert J. Jagers. \"The Role Of Sociopolitical Attitudes And Civic Education In The Civic Engagement Of Black Youth.\" ''Journal of Research on Adolescence (Wiley-Blackwell)'' 24.3 (2014): 460–70. ''Professional Development Collection''. Web. 11 Apr. 2016.</ref>

Another study by Chan describes the effect of the association of development and environmental factors among a group of at-risk youth such as African-Americans and Latino participants who come from low-income families that dwell in inner-city neighborhoods. Their research resulted in variations according to their participants as the racial minority youth were motivated and had aspiring goals for their futures due to early participation in civic engagement activities, but there was no sufficient evidence that this type of mindset will follow them into their adulthood.<ref>Chan, Wing, Suh-Ruu Ou, and Arthur Reynolds. \"Adolescent Civic Engagement And Adult Outcomes: An Examination Among Urban Racial Minorities.\" ''Journal of Youth & Adolescence'' 43.11 (2014): 1829–43  ''CINAHL Complete''. Web. 11 Apr. 2016.</ref> Looking into another oppressed group, Latinos, according to this report in the New York Times, states between 2000 and 2012 the number of Hispanics eligible to vote increased to an estimate of 10 million, but there is a lack of taking an active approach towards dealing with the issues such as immigration and causing a stir within the Latino community. The Hispanic demographic is becoming a potential influence of power within political polls.<ref>Suro, Roberto. \"Whatever Happened to Latino Political Power?\" ''The New York Times''. 2 January 2016. Web. 12 April 2016.</ref> To expand on another group that are oppressed is immigrant parents and their children in Jensen's study their concentration is on Asia and Latin America. In their study they sampled a small group from a metropolitan area, the difference between both generations varies as the children who were in high school which is 87.5% were stated to be civically engaged. Whereas for the parents they were not civically engaged in issues but developed \"bilcultural consciousness\" such as sending money back their original country of origin and these participants saw it as their duty in their current state of opportunity to be civically engaged.<ref>Jensen, Lene Arnett. \"Immigrants' Cultural Identities As Sources Of Civic Engagement.\" ''Applied Developmental Science'' 12.2 (2008): 74–83.

== Technology ==

'''Civic engagement, interpersonal trust, and television use''' – [[Social capital]] has been on the decline for years and Putnam looked into why this is. One of the areas the study covered was television and its effects on social and civic engagements. Shah writes that Putnam found the more TV a person watches, the less they are active in outside activities. This is shown with the rise of TV in the 60s and the fall of civic engagements. They found that though news and educational programming can actually aide in a citizen's knowledge, but the lack of engaging in outside activities and social events hurts civic engagement in general.<ref>Shah, D. V. (1998). \"Civic Engagement, Interpersonal Trust, and Television Use: An Individual‐Level Assessment of Social Capital\". ''Political Psychology'', 19(3), 469–96.</ref>

Nowadays, the internet has become the main social media outlet. Xenos and Moy found that the internet does help civic engagement but also give \"unjustifiable euphoria, abrupt and equally unjustifiable skepticism, and gradual realization that web-based human interaction really does have unique and politically significant properties\".<ref>Xenos, M., & Moy, P. (2007). \"Direct and differential effects of the Internet on political and civic engagement\". ''Journal of communication'', 57(4), 704–18.</ref>  We have all the information we want about and candidate at our fingertips, and the wealth of information is creating a more informed body. But with this comes misinformation and the two collide and do the opposite, creating a public with clashing opinions.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/digitalcitizensh0000moss|url-access=registration|quote=civic engagement technology.|title=Digital Citizenship: The Internet, Society, and Participation|last=Mossberger|first=Karen|author-link1=Karen Mossberger|last2=Tolbert|first2=Caroline J.|author-link2=Caroline Tolbert|last3=McNeal|first3=Ramona S.|date=2007-10-12|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262250191|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/>

The Knight Foundation outlines four different ways technology can assist in civic engagement. The four different ways include upgrading and providing e-services, making information more transparent, allowing e-democracy, and a service they call co-production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knightfoundation.org/articles/four-ideas-on-how-tech-can-increase-civic-engagement|title=Knight Foundation|website=www.knightfoundation.org|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref> E-services would allow digital technologies to improve the efficiency of urban services within a city. This would allow the services to become more effective as well as give the public a way to get involved. E-Democracy and Co-Production would work by allowing citizens to shape public policy by allowing them to partake in actions through technology. The Knight Foundation claims technology can make information more transparent, allowing the public to access the information and get involved.

There are countries, like Romania, where the new technologies started to influence the civic participation, in the last years. New media is becoming a factor of increasing civic mobilization for the new generations. New studies about that, at [[Center for Civic Participation and Democracy]] from [[SNSPA]], [[Romania]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://civicparticipation.ro/|title=SNSPA – Center for Civic Participation and Democracy|website=civicparticipation.ro|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-06}}</ref> [[Center for Civic Participation and Democracy]] (CPD) is a unit of research, analysis, and evaluation of citizen participation in the democratic process, both at the national and [[European Union|European]] level.Created at the [[National University of Political Studies and Public Administration|National School of Political Science and Public Administration]], CPD brings together experts in areas such as Political Science, Sociology, Administrative Sciences, Communications, International Relations and European Studies and it objectifies the SNSPA role and status of ''School of governance''. It is run by [[Remus Pricopie]] and [[Dan Sultanescu]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://civicparticipation.ro/team/|title=The Team – SNSPA|website=civicparticipation.ro|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-06}}</ref>

== Role of higher education ==

It can be argued that a fundamental step in creating a functioning society begins with the civic education of children within the community.  According to Diann Cameron Kelly, \"When our young children serve their communities through volunteerism, political participation or through vocal activism, they are more likely to emerge...voting and serving all aspects of society\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Civic readiness: Preparing toddlers and young children for civic education and sustained engagement|author=Kelly, DC|journal=National Civic Review|date=Winter 2008|volume=97|issue= 4|pages=55–59|doi=10.1002/ncr.234}}</ref>   Kelly argues that children should be taught how their community works and who chooses the rules we live by even before they enter school.  Other voices maintain that civic education is a lifelong process, even for those who make decisions on behalf of the citizens they serve.

To answer this challenge, the incorporation of [[service-learning]] into collegiate course design has gained acceptance as a pedagogy that links curricular content with civic education. In a recent study, students who participated in service learning even one time appear to have made gains in knowledge of and commitment to civic engagement when compared to non-service learners.<ref>Prentice, M. & G. Robinson (2010) ''Linking Service Learning and Civic Engagement in Community College Students''. American Association of Community Colleges: Washington, D.C.</ref> [[Campus Compact]], a coalition of nearly 1200 college presidents (as of 2013) promotes the development of citizenship skills by creating community partnerships and providing resources to train faculty to integrate civic and community-based learning into the curriculum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compact.org/about/history-mission-vision/|title=Mission & Vision - Campus Compact}}</ref> Building on the acceptance of service learning and civic engagement in higher education, The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement in Teaching created the Political Engagement Project in 2003 to develop the political knowledge and skills of college-aged students.<ref>McCartney, A., Bennion, E. & D. Simpson (2013). ''Teaching Civic Engagement: From Student to Active Citizen''. American Political Science Association: Washington, D.C., p. xiv.</ref> The [[American Democracy Project (AASCU initiative)|American Democracy Project]] (ADP) was launched in the same year by the [[American Association of State Colleges and Universities|American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU)]].<ref name=\"aascu.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aascu.org/programs/ADP/|title=American Democracy Project: About Us}}</ref> The American Democracy Project was joined by the American Democracy Commitment,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedemocracycommitment.org|title=Home – The Democracy Commitment}}</ref> a partnership of community colleges, to sponsor an annual national conference focused on higher education's role in preparing the next generation of informed, engaged citizens. The American Democracy Project also sponsors campus-based initiatives including voter registration, curriculum revision projects, and special days of action and reflection, such as the MLK Day of Service. In a report entitled,'' A Crucible Moment: College Learning and Democracy's Future ''issued in 2012 by the National Task Force on Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement, a joint project of the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] and the American Association of Colleges and Universities, the authors argue that higher education must serve as an intellectual incubator and socially responsible partner in advancing civic learning and democratic engagement.

'''The report recommends four basic steps to build civic minded institutions:'''

# Foster a civic ethos across the campus culture.
# Make civic literacy a core expectation for all students.
# Practice civic inquiry across all fields of study.
# Advance civic action through transformative partnerships.<ref>The National Task Force of Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement. 2012. ''A Crucible Moment: College Learning and Democracy's Future.''  Washington, DC: American Association of Colleges and Universities.</ref>

These higher education-based initiatives endeavor to build in college students, a politically engaged identity while enhancing the capacity to evaluate the political landscape and make informed decisions about participation in our democracy.<ref>Colby, A., Beaumont, E., Ehrlich, T, & J. Corngold. (2007) ''Educating for Democracy: Preparing Undergraduates for Responsible Political Engagement''. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Jossey-Bass: San Francisco. pp. 16–17.</ref> As evidenced by the growth in coalitions, professional development opportunities and civic education research, institutions of higher education and their association partners are committed to help prepare the next generation of citizens to become tomorrow's \"Stewards of Place\".<ref name=\"aascu.org\"/>

Many universities, like the University of Minnesota, have begun to focus on increasing the civic engagement of students and have mandated that educators begin incorporating it into several school activities. Edwin Fogelman, author of ''Civic Engagement at the University of Minnesota,'' states that true civic engagement can only be practiced by those living within a Democracy. According to Fogelman, civic engagement is largely shaped by schools. Education institutions have the skills to foster \"civic competence, critical thinking, and Public Spirit, which empower citizens to become engaged\". Many claim that civic engagement ought to become part of the curriculum and that higher education institutions should provide opportunities to become engaged such as internships, service-learning, and community based activities. Institutions also need to provide outlets where students can have open discussions over concerns and controversial issues.<ref>Fogelman, Edwin. \"Civic Engagement At The University Of Minnesota.\" ''Journal of Public Affairs'' 6.(2002): 103. ''Academic Search Complete''. Web. 13 Apr. 2016.</ref>

Some schools such as [[Widener University]], have made civic engagement a core goal of the university. The university strives to get students involved in the local community to become more aware and civically engaged.

===Civic learning===

In January 2012, the U.S. Department of Education issued a road map and a call to action entitled ''Advancing Civic Learning and Engagement in Democracy '' that offers nine steps to enhancing the Department of Education's commitment to civic learning and engagement in democracy.

'''These steps include:'''

# Convene and catalyze schools and post-secondary institutions to increase and enhance high-quality civic learning and engagement
# Identify additional civic indicators.
# Identify promising practices in civic learning and democratic engagement—and encourage further research to learn what works.
# Leverage federal investments and public-private partnerships.
# Encourage community-based work-study placements.
# Encourage public service careers among college students and graduates.
# Support civic learning for a well-rounded K–12 curriculum.
# Engage Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority-Serving Institutions—including Hispanic Serving Institutions, Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander–Serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges and Universities-in a national dialogue to identify best practices.
# Highlight and promote student and family participation in education programs and policies at the federal and local levels.\"<ref>U.S. Department of Education, Office of the Under Secretary and Office of Postsecondary Education, Advancing Civic Learning and Engagement in Democracy: A Road Map and Call to Action, Washington, D.C., 2012. pp. 22–26.</ref>

==History==
Archaeological excavations and surveys carried out in [[Van province]] indicate that the history of human settlement in this region goes back at least as far as 5000 BC. The Tilkitepe Mound, which is on the shores of Lake Van and a few kilometres to the south of [[Van Castle]], is the only source of information about the oldest culture of Van.

===Urartu===
[[File:Xerxes Cuneiform Van.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Xerxes I's inscription at Van|Inscription of Xerxes the Great]] on the cliffs below [[Van Fortress|Van castle]].]]
[[File:Akhtamar Island on Lake Van with the Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Lake Van]]]]

Under the ancient name of ''[[Tushpa]]'', Van was the capital of the [[Urartu|Urartian kingdom]] in the 9th century BC. The early settlement was centered on the steep-sided bluff now known as [[Van Castle]] (''Van Kalesi''), close to the edge of Lake Van and a few kilometers west of the modern city. Here have been found Urartian [[cuneiform]] inscriptions dating to the 8th and 7th centuries BC. In the trilingual [[Behistun]] [[inscription]], carved in the order of [[Darius the Great]] of [[Persia]], the country referred to as ''[[Urartu]]'' in Babylonian is called ''[[Armenia]]'' in Old Persian.

The name 'Van' comes from the [[Urartian language|Urartian]] ''Biaina''.<ref>Edmund Herzig, Marina Kurkchiyan, ''The Armenians: Past And Present In The Making Of National Identity'', p. 31</ref>

===Kingdom of Armenia===
The region came under the control of the [[Orontid dynasty|Orontids]] in the 7th century BC and quickly later the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in the mid 6th century BC. The [[Van Fortress]] located outside Van holds an inscribed stereotyped trilingual inscription of [[Xerxes the Great]] from the 5th century BC upon a smoothed section of the rock face, some {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} above the ground near the fortress. The inscription survives in near perfect condition and is divided into three columns of 27 lines written in (from left to right) [[Old Persian]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], and [[Elamite]]. In 331 BC, Van was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] and after his death became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. By the early 2nd century BC it was part of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. It became an important center during the reign of the [[Armenia]]n king, [[Tigranes II of Armenia|Tigranes II]], who founded the city of [[Tigranocerta|Tigranakert]] in the 1st century BC.<ref>The Journal of Roman Studies – Page 124 by Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies</ref> In the early centuries BC, it fell to the emerging [[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia]] until the 3rd century AD. However, it also fell once to the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia]] in this timespan. In the ''[[History of Armenia (Movses Khorenatsi)|History of Armenia]]'' attributed to [[Movses Khorenatsi]], the city is called ''Tosp'', from Urartian ''Tushpa''.<ref>http://rbedrosian.com/Classic/kvan1.htm</ref>

===Byzantines, Sassanids, and the Artsrunis===
{{Main|Vaspurakan}}
Following the fall of the Parthians and the emergence of the Neo-Persian Empire, better known as the [[Sassanian Empire]],<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sass/hd_sass.htm The Met Museum Website: The Sasanian Empire (224–651 A.D.)]</ref> the town naturally fell into the possession of the latter. During the over 700 years lasting [[Roman-Persian Wars]], some of the wars razed at or around the location of modern-day Van. The [[Byzantine Empire]] briefly held the region from 628 to 640, following the victory in the climactic [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]], after which it was invaded by the Muslim Arabs, who consolidated their conquests as the province of [[Arminiya]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9lHeh36S8ooC&pg=PT1462&lpg=PT1462&dq=arabs+consolidated+arminiya&source=bl&ots=POFYPrUuOa&sig=0j_GVrgMMeoHT6j4mQ9oKRxQ2fU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5-67O6rPRAhVKJCYKHc8wAlwQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&q=arabs%20consolidated%20arminiya&f=false The Cambridge Medieval History Series volumes 1–5 by Plantagenet Publishing, 2nd to last paragraph on the page linked to.

===Seljuk Empire===

Incursions by the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] Turks into Vaspurakan started in the 1050s. After their victory in 1071 at the [[battle of Manzikert]] the entire region fell under their control. After them, local Muslim rulers emerged, such as the [[Ahlatshahs]] and the [[Ayyubids]] (1207). For a 20-year period, Van was held by the [[Sultanate of Rûm|Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] until the 1240s when it was conquered by the [[Mongols]]. In the 14th century, Van was held by the [[Timurids]], followed subsequently by the Turkoman [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]] confederations.

===Turco-Iranian rivalry and the Ottoman era===
{{see also|Eyalet of Van|Vilayet of Van}}
The first half of the 15th century saw the Van region become a land of conflict as it was disputed by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the neighboring Persian [[Safavid]] Empire. The Safavids captured Van in 1502, as it went naturally with all former territories of the Ak Koyunlu. The Ottomans took the city in 1515 following the climactic [[Battle of Chaldiran]] and held it for a short period. The Safavids retook it again in 1520 but the Ottomans gained an almost definite hold of it in 1548 during another Ottoman-Safavid War. Ottoman control over the town got confirmed in the 1555 [[Peace of Amasya]] which came as a result after the end of the war. They first made Van into a [[sanjak]] dependent on the [[Erzurum eyalet]], and later into a separate [[Van eyalet]] in about 1570. In 1602, the Safavids under king [[Abbas the Great]] recaptured Van alongside other swaths of lost territories in Eastern Anatolia. However, Ottoman control over it was at last now made final and definite in 1639 with the [[Treaty of Zuhab]].

During the early 1900s, the city of Van had eleven Armenian schools and ten Turkish schools.<ref name=\"Hewsen-2000\">{{Armenian Van-Vaspurakan 2000|first=Robert H.|last=Hewsen|page=40|title=Van in This World: Paradise in the Next: The Historical Geography of Van/Vaspurakan.<br> Armenian churches within the walled city included Saint Tiramayr ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Տիրամայր}}), Saint Vardan ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Վարդան}}), Saint Poghos ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Պողոս}}), Saint Nshan ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Նշան}}), Saint Sahak ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Սահակ}}), and Saint Tsiranavor ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Ծիրանաւոր}}); in Aygestan ({{lang-hy|Այգեստան}}), Haykavank ({{lang-hy|Հայկավանք}}), Norashen ({{lang-hy|Նորաշէն}}), Arark ({{lang-hy|Արարք}}), Hankoysner, and other quarters each had a church.}}</ref> Towards the second half of the 19th century Van began to play an increased role in the politics of the Ottoman Empire due to its location near the borders of the Persian, Russian and Ottoman Empire, as well as its proximity to Mosul. During the period leading up to the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, Armenians were well represented in the local administration.<ref>Hewler, 39</ref>

====Demographics====
The demographics of Ottoman Van are a debated and contentious point as they relate directly to claims of ownership by either side prior to the outbreak of World War I. For the city of Van itself it's estimated that it had 50,000 inhabitants prior to World War I, of whom 30,000 were Armenian and 20,000 were Muslims. Based on the official 1914 Ottoman Census the population of Van province consisted of 179,422 Muslims and 67,797 Armenians.<ref>Values as printed in the [[:File:Proportions des populations en Asie Mineure statistique officielle d1914.png|official statistics from 1914]].</ref> The Ottoman Census figures include only male citizens, excluding women and children. According to a more recent research, the corrected estimates for the Van province (including women and children) are: 313,000 Muslims, 130,000 Armenians, and 65,000 others, including [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].<ref>Justin McCarthy: ''Muslims and Minorities.'' New York University Press, 1983, p. 110 f.</ref>

The demographics of Van are a greatly debated point, given the changing provincial borders. For example, in 1875 the province was divided; Van and Hakkari were separated, only to be rejoined in 1888, drastically changing the census numbers. Some writers argue that this merging was done to keep the Armenians from forming a majority.<ref>Hewsen, 35.</ref> In 1862 it was estimated that in Van there were 90,100 Christians (including [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]]) and 95,100 Muslims.<ref>[[Anahide Ter Minassian]]: \"The city of Van at the Turn of the Twentieth Century.\" In: Richard G. Hovannisian: ''Armenian Van/Vaspurakan.'' Mazda Publishers, Costa Mesa/CA 2000, p. 179.</ref> The French Consul in Van reported that in Van and Bitlis 51.46% were [[Kurds]], 32.70% were Armenians and 5.53% were Turks.<ref>Minassian, 180.</ref> On the other hand, the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople estimated 185,000 Armenians in Van, 18,000 Assyrians, 72,000 Kurds, 47,000 Turks, 25,000 [[Yezidi]]s and 3,000 [[Gypsie]]s.<ref>Minassian, 181.</ref> Both sides have been accused of overcounting the numbers at the time given the revival of the [[Armenian Question]] and population statistics became important during the [[Berlin Conference]].<ref>Sarkis Y.

===The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878===

During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)]], the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] Sheikh, Jalaleddin, led thousands of soldiers to massacre the Armenians of the province and destroyed and plundered many of their villages.<ref>[https://www.sophenearmeniaca.com/2019/03/06/who-was-sheikh-jalaleddin/ Who Was Sheikh Jalaleddin?]</ref> These events are characterized in the non-fiction book ''Armenia and the Campaign of 1877'' by British war correspondent Charles B. Norman and in the fictional novella [[Jalaleddin (novella)|''Jalaleddin'']] by the Armenian novelist [[Raffi (novelist)|Raffi]] in very similar terms.<ref>[https://www.sophenearmeniaca.com/2019/01/06/jalaleddin-and-the-russo-turkish-war-of-1877-1878/ Jalaleddin and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878]</ref>

===World War I and Armenian Genocide===

Some scholars explain that the [[Armenian resistance during World War I|Armenians launched a rebellion]] at Van in 1915, lured by Russian promises of independence. Other scholars argue that the Armenian residents, hoping to avoid the slaughter being inflicted on the rural populations surrounding Van, defended themselves in the Armenian quarters of the city against the Turks.<ref name=\"gens\">The Banality of Indifference: Zionism and the Armenian Genocide – Page 42 by Yaïr Auron</ref> The Russians finally relieved the Armenian defenders of Van in late May 1915. In August, a victory over the Russian army allowed the Ottoman army to retake Van. In September 1915, the Russians forced the Turks out of Van for the second time. Russian forces began to leave the area after the [[October Revolution]] in Russia in 1917, and by April 1918, it was recaptured by the Ottoman army. According to Taner Akçam, citing the ''Osmanli Belgelerinde Ermeniler 1915–1920'' (Armenians in Ottoman Documents, 1915–1920), after the Turks took back the city from the Russians, they killed all Armenians in the city.<ref>Akçam, p. 140</ref> [[Clarence Ussher]], an American physician and missionary in Van, and an eye-witness to the events, reported that 55,000 Armenians had been killed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rubenstein|first=Richard L.|title=Jihad and genocide|year=2010|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0742562028|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYez6YcL-B8C|edition=1st pbk.}}</ref><ref name=Sjacobs>{{cite book|last=L.

===Turkish War of Independence and Republic===
[[File:Van City, Turkey overview 2011.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The center of modern Van seen from the castle rock]]
In the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] decided to cede the city to the [[First Republic of Armenia]]. [[Turkish revolutionaries]], led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] rejected the terms of the treaty and instead waged the [[Turkish War of Independence]].  However the idea of ceding Van to the Armenians was floated, and Ismet Inonu was said to have surveyed army officers on 14 October 1919 on the issue of ceding Van and Bitlis. However the parliament in Ankara rejected any compromise on this issue.<ref>Akçam, Taner. \"A shameful Act.\" Translated by Paul Bessemer. Metropolitan Books, New York. 2006.</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} By 1920, Van fell under Turkish control again and its remaining Armenian inhabitants were expelled in a final round of [[ethnic cleansing]].<ref name=\"gens\"/> With the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] and [[Treaty of Kars]], the Treaty of Sèvres was annulled and Van remained de facto under Turkish sovereignty.

By the end of the conflicts, the town of Van was empty and in ruins. The city was rebuilt after the war a few kilometers east of the ancient citadel, which is now known as [[Van Castle]] (''Van Kalesi''). The city now lies at about {{convert|1,750|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

In culinary terms, as some cities in Turkey became renowned for their [[kebap]] culture or other types of traditional local dishes, Van has distinguished itself with its breakfast culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180715-the-turkish-city-that-lives-for-breakfast|title=The Turkish city that lives for breakfast|last=Osterlund|first=Paul Benjamin|language=en|access-date=2018-07-17}}</ref> You can find all sorts of food in Van, but pides are in all of their meals.

==Transport==
Van stands on Highway D300, which runs from the Iranian border 100&nbsp;km east at Kapikoy through Van then along the south lake shore to [[Tatvan]] (100&nbsp;km), and westwards to the rest of Turkey. Highway D975 runs north to Dogubeyazit and south towards Hakkari. Frequent buses and dolmuses ply these highways.

Van is the western terminus of the railway line from Iran, with freight and passenger trains (suspended between 2015 and 2018). There is a [[train ferry]] (upgraded in 2015) across the lake to Tatvan. There is no railway around the lake; it is intended eventually to build one but to date there are no plans. This would actually create an unbroken rail link between Europe and the Indian subcontinent, as Tatvan is the terminus of the line to Ankara and Istanbul.

Van has daily flights to Istanbul, Ankara and other major Turkish cities from  [[Van Ferit Melen Airport|Ferit Melen Airport]].

==Media==
Near Van, there is a [[longwave]] broadcasting station with a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=mid|-tall}} guyed mast. It went in service in 1990 and operates on 225&nbsp;kHz with 600&nbsp;kW. It has also local news outlets like ''Van Gazetesi'' or ''Gazete Van.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vanhavadis.com/|title=VAN HAVADİS GAZETESİ {{!}} Van Haber, Son Dakika, Van Haberleri|website=vanhavadis.com|language=tr|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vangazetesi.com/|title=Van Gazetesi|website=Türkiye'nin Uluslararası Haber Sitesi ve Gazetesi|language=tr|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref>

The city has a long history as a major urban area. It has been a large city since the first millennium BC, initially as [[Tushpa]], the capital of the kingdom of [[Urartu]] from the 9th century BC to the 6th century BC, and later as the center of the Armenian kingdom of [[Vaspurakan]].

==History==
Archaeological excavations and surveys carried out in [[Van province]] indicate that the history of human settlement in this region goes back at least as far as 5000 BC. The Tilkitepe Mound, which is on the shores of Lake Van and a few kilometres to the south of [[Van Castle]], is the only source of information about the oldest culture of Van.

===Urartu===
[[File:Xerxes Cuneiform Van.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Xerxes I's inscription at Van|Inscription of Xerxes the Great]] on the cliffs below [[Van Fortress|Van castle]].]]
[[File:Akhtamar Island on Lake Van with the Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Lake Van]]]]

Under the ancient name of ''[[Tushpa]]'', Van was the capital of the [[Urartu|Urartian kingdom]] in the 9th century BC. The early settlement was centered on the steep-sided bluff now known as [[Van Castle]] (''Van Kalesi''), close to the edge of Lake Van and a few kilometers west of the modern city. Here have been found Urartian [[cuneiform]] inscriptions dating to the 8th and 7th centuries BC. In the trilingual [[Behistun]] [[inscription]], carved in the order of [[Darius the Great]] of [[Persia]], the country referred to as ''[[Urartu]]'' in Babylonian is called ''[[Armenia]]'' in Old Persian.

The name 'Van' comes from the [[Urartian language|Urartian]] ''Biaina''.<ref>Edmund Herzig, Marina Kurkchiyan, ''The Armenians: Past And Present In The Making Of National Identity'', p. 31</ref>

===Kingdom of Armenia===
The region came under the control of the [[Orontid dynasty|Orontids]] in the 7th century BC and quickly later the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in the mid 6th century BC. The [[Van Fortress]] located outside Van holds an inscribed stereotyped trilingual inscription of [[Xerxes the Great]] from the 5th century BC upon a smoothed section of the rock face, some {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} above the ground near the fortress. The inscription survives in near perfect condition and is divided into three columns of 27 lines written in (from left to right) [[Old Persian]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], and [[Elamite]]. In 331 BC, Van was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] and after his death became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. By the early 2nd century BC it was part of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. It became an important center during the reign of the [[Armenia]]n king, [[Tigranes II of Armenia|Tigranes II]], who founded the city of [[Tigranocerta|Tigranakert]] in the 1st century BC.<ref>The Journal of Roman Studies – Page 124 by Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies</ref> In the early centuries BC, it fell to the emerging [[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia]] until the 3rd century AD. However, it also fell once to the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia]] in this timespan. In the ''[[History of Armenia (Movses Khorenatsi)|History of Armenia]]'' attributed to [[Movses Khorenatsi]], the city is called ''Tosp'', from Urartian ''Tushpa''.<ref>http://rbedrosian.com/Classic/kvan1.htm</ref>

===Byzantines, Sassanids, and the Artsrunis===
{{Main|Vaspurakan}}
Following the fall of the Parthians and the emergence of the Neo-Persian Empire, better known as the [[Sassanian Empire]],<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sass/hd_sass.htm The Met Museum Website: The Sasanian Empire (224–651 A.D.)]</ref> the town naturally fell into the possession of the latter. During the over 700 years lasting [[Roman-Persian Wars]], some of the wars razed at or around the location of modern-day Van. The [[Byzantine Empire]] briefly held the region from 628 to 640, following the victory in the climactic [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]], after which it was invaded by the Muslim Arabs, who consolidated their conquests as the province of [[Arminiya]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9lHeh36S8ooC&pg=PT1462&lpg=PT1462&dq=arabs+consolidated+arminiya&source=bl&ots=POFYPrUuOa&sig=0j_GVrgMMeoHT6j4mQ9oKRxQ2fU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5-67O6rPRAhVKJCYKHc8wAlwQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&q=arabs%20consolidated%20arminiya&f=false The Cambridge Medieval History Series volumes 1–5 by Plantagenet Publishing, 2nd to last paragraph on the page linked to.

===Seljuk Empire===

Incursions by the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] Turks into Vaspurakan started in the 1050s. After their victory in 1071 at the [[battle of Manzikert]] the entire region fell under their control. After them, local Muslim rulers emerged, such as the [[Ahlatshahs]] and the [[Ayyubids]] (1207). For a 20-year period, Van was held by the [[Sultanate of Rûm|Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] until the 1240s when it was conquered by the [[Mongols]]. In the 14th century, Van was held by the [[Timurids]], followed subsequently by the Turkoman [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]] confederations.

===Turco-Iranian rivalry and the Ottoman era===
{{see also|Eyalet of Van|Vilayet of Van}}
The first half of the 15th century saw the Van region become a land of conflict as it was disputed by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the neighboring Persian [[Safavid]] Empire. The Safavids captured Van in 1502, as it went naturally with all former territories of the Ak Koyunlu. The Ottomans took the city in 1515 following the climactic [[Battle of Chaldiran]] and held it for a short period. The Safavids retook it again in 1520 but the Ottomans gained an almost definite hold of it in 1548 during another Ottoman-Safavid War. Ottoman control over the town got confirmed in the 1555 [[Peace of Amasya]] which came as a result after the end of the war. They first made Van into a [[sanjak]] dependent on the [[Erzurum eyalet]], and later into a separate [[Van eyalet]] in about 1570. In 1602, the Safavids under king [[Abbas the Great]] recaptured Van alongside other swaths of lost territories in Eastern Anatolia. However, Ottoman control over it was at last now made final and definite in 1639 with the [[Treaty of Zuhab]].

During the period leading up to the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, Armenians were well represented in the local administration.<ref>Hewler, 39</ref>

====Demographics====
The demographics of Ottoman Van are a debated and contentious point as they relate directly to claims of ownership by either side prior to the outbreak of World War I. For the city of Van itself it's estimated that it had 50,000 inhabitants prior to World War I, of whom 30,000 were Armenian and 20,000 were Muslims. Based on the official 1914 Ottoman Census the population of Van province consisted of 179,422 Muslims and 67,797 Armenians.<ref>Values as printed in the [[:File:Proportions des populations en Asie Mineure statistique officielle d1914.png|official statistics from 1914]].</ref> The Ottoman Census figures include only male citizens, excluding women and children. According to a more recent research, the corrected estimates for the Van province (including women and children) are: 313,000 Muslims, 130,000 Armenians, and 65,000 others, including [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].<ref>Justin McCarthy: ''Muslims and Minorities.'' New York University Press, 1983, p. 110 f.</ref>

The demographics of Van are a greatly debated point, given the changing provincial borders. For example, in 1875 the province was divided; Van and Hakkari were separated, only to be rejoined in 1888, drastically changing the census numbers. Some writers argue that this merging was done to keep the Armenians from forming a majority.<ref>Hewsen, 35.</ref> In 1862 it was estimated that in Van there were 90,100 Christians (including [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]]) and 95,100 Muslims.<ref>[[Anahide Ter Minassian]]: \"The city of Van at the Turn of the Twentieth Century.\" In: Richard G. Hovannisian: ''Armenian Van/Vaspurakan.'' Mazda Publishers, Costa Mesa/CA 2000, p. 179.</ref> The French Consul in Van reported that in Van and Bitlis 51.46% were [[Kurds]], 32.70% were Armenians and 5.53% were Turks.<ref>Minassian, 180.</ref> On the other hand, the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople estimated 185,000 Armenians in Van, 18,000 Assyrians, 72,000 Kurds, 47,000 Turks, 25,000 [[Yezidi]]s and 3,000 [[Gypsie]]s.<ref>Minassian, 181.</ref> Both sides have been accused of overcounting the numbers at the time given the revival of the [[Armenian Question]] and population statistics became important during the [[Berlin Conference]].<ref>Sarkis Y. Karayan: \"Demography of Van Province, 1844–1914\". In: [[Richard G. Hovannisian]]: ''Armenian Van/Vaspurakan''. Mazda Publishers, Costa Mesa/CA 2000, p. 196.</ref>

===The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878===

During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)]], the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] Sheikh, Jalaleddin, led thousands of soldiers to massacre the Armenians of the province and destroyed and plundered many of their villages.<ref>[https://www.sophenearmeniaca.com/2019/03/06/who-was-sheikh-jalaleddin/ Who Was Sheikh Jalaleddin?]</ref> These events are characterized in the non-fiction book ''Armenia and the Campaign of 1877'' by British war correspondent Charles B. Norman and in the fictional novella [[Jalaleddin (novella)|''Jalaleddin'']] by the Armenian novelist [[Raffi (novelist)|Raffi]] in very similar terms.<ref>[https://www.sophenearmeniaca.com/2019/01/06/jalaleddin-and-the-russo-turkish-war-of-1877-1878/ Jalaleddin and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878]</ref>

===World War I and Armenian Genocide===

The province's Armenian population was devastated during [[Armenian Genocide]] by the [[Young Turks]].<ref>Akcam, Taner. ''A Shameful Act'', p. 140. New York:Henry Holt Co. 2006. {{ISBN|0-8050-8665-X}}</ref> The regional administrator, [[Cevdet Bey]], was reported to have said that \"We have cleansed the Armenians and Syriac [Christian]s from [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]], and we will do the same in Van.<ref name=\"Akçam, 201\">Akçam, 201</ref> Numerous reports from Ottoman officials, such as a parliament deputy, the governor of [[Aleppo]] as well as the German consul in Van, suggested that deliberate provocations against the Armenians were being orchestrated by the local government.<ref name=\"Akçam, 201\"/> In mid-April 1915, Cevdet Bey ordered the execution of four Armenian leaders,<ref>Morgenthau, Henry.

Some scholars explain that the [[Armenian resistance during World War I|Armenians launched a rebellion]] at Van in 1915, lured by Russian promises of independence. Other scholars argue that the Armenian residents, hoping to avoid the slaughter being inflicted on the rural populations surrounding Van, defended themselves in the Armenian quarters of the city against the Turks.<ref name=\"gens\">The Banality of Indifference: Zionism and the Armenian Genocide – Page 42 by Yaïr Auron</ref> The Russians finally relieved the Armenian defenders of Van in late May 1915. In August, a victory over the Russian army allowed the Ottoman army to retake Van. In September 1915, the Russians forced the Turks out of Van for the second time. Russian forces began to leave the area after the [[October Revolution]] in Russia in 1917, and by April 1918, it was recaptured by the Ottoman army. According to Taner Akçam, citing the ''Osmanli Belgelerinde Ermeniler 1915–1920'' (Armenians in Ottoman Documents, 1915–1920), after the Turks took back the city from the Russians, they killed all Armenians in the city.<ref>Akçam, p. 140</ref> [[Clarence Ussher]], an American physician and missionary in Van, and an eye-witness to the events, reported that 55,000 Armenians had been killed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rubenstein|first=Richard L.|title=Jihad and genocide|year=2010|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0742562028|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYez6YcL-B8C|edition=1st pbk.}}</ref><ref name=Sjacobs>{{cite book|last=L.

===Turkish War of Independence and Republic===
[[File:Van City, Turkey overview 2011.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The center of modern Van seen from the castle rock]]
In the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] decided to cede the city to the [[First Republic of Armenia]]. [[Turkish revolutionaries]], led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] rejected the terms of the treaty and instead waged the [[Turkish War of Independence]].  However the idea of ceding Van to the Armenians was floated, and Ismet Inonu was said to have surveyed army officers on 14 October 1919 on the issue of ceding Van and Bitlis. However the parliament in Ankara rejected any compromise on this issue.<ref>Akçam, Taner. \"A shameful Act.\" Translated by Paul Bessemer. Metropolitan Books, New York. 2006.</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} By 1920, Van fell under Turkish control again and its remaining Armenian inhabitants were expelled in a final round of [[ethnic cleansing]].<ref name=\"gens\"/> With the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] and [[Treaty of Kars]], the Treaty of Sèvres was annulled and Van remained de facto under Turkish sovereignty.

By the end of the conflicts, the town of Van was empty and in ruins. The city was rebuilt after the war a few kilometers east of the ancient citadel, which is now known as [[Van Castle]] (''Van Kalesi''). The city now lies at about {{convert|1,750|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

== Politics ==
The current acting Mayor of the city is the Governor of the Province Van, Mehmet Emin Bilmez. The [[2019 Turkish local elections|local elections]] in March 2019 won Bedia Özgökçe Ertan and she acted as the Mayor until August 2019, when she was dismissed due to accusations for supporting terrorism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bianet.org/english/politics/211823-metropolitan-mayors-of-diyarbakir-mardin-and-van-removed-from-office|title=Metropolitan Mayors of Diyarbakir, Mardin and Van removed from office|website=Bianet|archive-date=19 August 2019}}</ref>

===Landmarks===
The modern city is located on the plain extending from the [[Lake Van]], at a distance of {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=off}} from the lake shore.

Van has often been called \"The Pearl of the East\" because of the beauty of its surrounding landscape. An old Armenian proverb in the same sense is \"Van in this world, paradise in the next.\"<ref>{{Cite book| last = Hewsen | first = Robert H. | title = Armenia: A Historical Atlas | year = 2001 | publisher = [[The University of Chicago Press]] | isbn = 0-226-33228-4 | pages = 207 }}</ref> This phrase has been slightly modified in Turkish as ''dünyada Van, ahirette iman'' or \"Van for this world, faith for the next.\"

[[File:Festîvala u Behra Wanê.JPG|thumb|Festival of Van lake 2011]]
The city is home to [[Van Yüzüncü Yıl Üniversitesi]] (''Van 100th Year University'') and recently came to the headlines for two highly publicized investigations initiated by the Prosecutor of Van, one of which was focused on accusations against the university's [[Rector (academia)|rector]], Prof. [[Hasan Ceylan]], who was kept in custody for a time. He was finally acquitted but lost his rectorate. He is a grandson of [[Güllü Agop|Agop Vartovyan]], an Ottoman Armenian who is accepted as the founder of modern Turkish theatre. Prof. Hasan Ceylan is also the department chairman of Environmental Engineering in the Van 100th Year University.

In 1941, Van suffered a destructive [[1941 Van–Erciş earthquake|5.9 M<sub>w</sub> earthquake]]. A more severe [[2011 Van earthquake|7.2 M<sub>w</sub> earthquake]] occurred on October 23, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/23/world/europe/turkey-earthquake/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 | title = Report: Death toll rises to 217 after massive earthquake in Turkey | date = 2011-10-24 | accessdate = 2011-10-24 | publisher=CNN}}</ref> On November 9, 2011, a 5.7 magnitude earthquake caused several buildings to collapse.

==Cuisine==
In culinary terms, as some cities in Turkey became renowned for their [[kebap]] culture or other types of traditional local dishes, Van has distinguished itself with its breakfast culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180715-the-turkish-city-that-lives-for-breakfast|title=The Turkish city that lives for breakfast|last=Osterlund|first=Paul Benjamin|language=en|access-date=2018-07-17}}</ref> You can find all sorts of food in Van, but pides are in all of their meals.
[[File:Vankahvalti.jpg|thumb|right|220px| Famous breakfast table in Van.]]

==Transport==
Van stands on Highway D300, which runs from the Iranian border 100&nbsp;km east at Kapikoy through Van then along the south lake shore to [[Tatvan]] (100&nbsp;km), and westwards to the rest of Turkey. Highway D975 runs north to Dogubeyazit and south towards Hakkari. Frequent buses and dolmuses ply these highways.

Van is the western terminus of the railway line from Iran, with freight and passenger trains (suspended between 2015 and 2018). There is a [[train ferry]] (upgraded in 2015) across the lake to Tatvan. There is no railway around the lake; it is intended eventually to build one but to date there are no plans. This would actually create an unbroken rail link between Europe and the Indian subcontinent, as Tatvan is the terminus of the line to Ankara and Istanbul.

Van has daily flights to Istanbul, Ankara and other major Turkish cities from  [[Van Ferit Melen Airport|Ferit Melen Airport]].

==Media==
Near Van, there is a [[longwave]] broadcasting station with a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=mid|-tall}} guyed mast. It went in service in 1990 and operates on 225&nbsp;kHz with 600&nbsp;kW. It has also local news outlets like ''Van Gazetesi'' or ''Gazete Van.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vanhavadis.com/|title=VAN HAVADİS GAZETESİ {{!}} Van Haber, Son Dakika, Van Haberleri|website=vanhavadis.com|language=tr|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vangazetesi.com/|title=Van Gazetesi|website=Türkiye'nin Uluslararası Haber Sitesi ve Gazetesi|language=tr|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref>

The band released their sixth album, ''[[Bad Vibrations]]'', in 2016.

==History==
===Formation (2009–10)===
Grouplove formed out of a friendship among the five members of the band. Hooper met Zucconi on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] after hearing and enjoying his music from his former band [[ALOKE]]. Despite having just met, Hooper invited Zucconi to an artist residency in [[Crete]] she was leaving for later that week.<ref name=\"Grouplove’s Christian Zucconi\">{{cite news|author=Fortune, Drew | title=Interview With Grouplove’s Christian Zucconi|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/grouploves-christian-zucconi,73655/|newspaper=A.V. Club|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref>  It was at the Ikarus artist commune in the village of Avdou where they met the rest of the band, Andrew Wessen, Ryan Rabin, and Sean Gadd. Rabin, an accomplished drummer and producer, grew up in [[Los Angeles]] with Wessen, a surfer and guitarist. Rabin comes from a musical family – his father is [[Trevor Rabin]], former guitarist of [[Yes (band)|Yes]]. Sean Gadd, a songwriter and guitarist from [[London]], was also at the commune. The friendship between the members formed quickly, but the band did not form until a year later after Gadd, Zucconi and Hooper pooled their funds together and made a trip to Rabin's Los Angeles recording studio. They played their first show at El Cid in Los Angeles on May 10, 2010.  Later that year, the band went on tour with [[Florence and The Machine]] on the west coast, and then [[The Joy Formidable]] on the east coast. By November, [[Nylon Magazine]] recognized Grouplove as one of the top ten in the \"Best New Bands in 2010.\"<ref name=\"mxdwn\">{{cite web|author=Emily Damon |url=http://www.mxdwn.com/2010/11/04/news/grouplove-to-release-debut-ep-january-25 |title=Grouplove To Release Debut EP January 25 |publisher=Mxdwn.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-16}}</ref>

Before even signing with Canvasback/[[Atlantic Records]] the band was in a money rut and had to license the song \"Getaway Car\" to HBO's \"How to Make it In America\" just to get by.<ref>Peters, Mitchell. \"Making It In America.\" ''International Index to Music Periodicals Full Text [ProQuest]''. Billboard, 15 Oct. 2011.</ref> Eventually the band was signed and decided to re-release their self-titled EP, ''[[Grouplove (EP)|Grouplove]]'', on January 25, 2011.  In 2011, the band co-headlined a cross-country tour with [[Foster the People]], and made appearances at [[Lollapalooza]], [[Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival|Outside Lands]], [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]], and [[Glastonbury]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.mxdwn.com/2011/11/25/news/grouplove-announce-spring-2012-tour-dates |title=Grouplove Announce Spring 2012 Tour Dates |publisher=Mxdwn.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-16}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation (2009–10)===
Grouplove formed out of a friendship among the five members of the band. Hooper met Zucconi on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] after hearing and enjoying his music from his former band [[ALOKE]]. Despite having just met, Hooper invited Zucconi to an artist residency in [[Crete]] she was leaving for later that week.<ref name=\"Grouplove’s Christian Zucconi\">{{cite news|author=Fortune, Drew | title=Interview With Grouplove’s Christian Zucconi|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/grouploves-christian-zucconi,73655/|newspaper=A.V. Club|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref>  It was at the Ikarus artist commune in the village of Avdou where they met the rest of the band, Andrew Wessen, Ryan Rabin, and Sean Gadd. Rabin, an accomplished drummer and producer, grew up in [[Los Angeles]] with Wessen, a surfer and guitarist. Rabin comes from a musical family – his father is [[Trevor Rabin]], former guitarist of [[Yes (band)|Yes]]. Sean Gadd, a songwriter and guitarist from [[London]], was also at the commune. The friendship between the members formed quickly, but the band did not form until a year later after Gadd, Zucconi and Hooper pooled their funds together and made a trip to Rabin's Los Angeles recording studio. They played their first show at El Cid in Los Angeles on May 10, 2010.  Later that year, the band went on tour with [[Florence and The Machine]] on the west coast, and then [[The Joy Formidable]] on the east coast. By November, [[Nylon Magazine]] recognized Grouplove as one of the top ten in the \"Best New Bands in 2010.\"<ref name=\"mxdwn\">{{cite web|author=Emily Damon |url=http://www.mxdwn.com/2010/11/04/news/grouplove-to-release-debut-ep-january-25 |title=Grouplove To Release Debut EP January 25 |publisher=Mxdwn.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-16}}</ref>

Before even signing with Canvasback/[[Atlantic Records]] the band was in a money rut and had to license the song \"Getaway Car\" to HBO's \"How to Make it In America\" just to get by.<ref>Peters, Mitchell. \"Making It In America.\" ''International Index to Music Periodicals Full Text [ProQuest]''. Billboard, 15 Oct. 2011.</ref> Eventually the band was signed and decided to re-release their self-titled EP, ''[[Grouplove (EP)|Grouplove]]'', on January 25, 2011.  In 2011, the band co-headlined a cross-country tour with [[Foster the People]], and made appearances at [[Lollapalooza]], [[Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival|Outside Lands]], [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]], and [[Glastonbury]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.mxdwn.com/2011/11/25/news/grouplove-announce-spring-2012-tour-dates |title=Grouplove Announce Spring 2012 Tour Dates |publisher=Mxdwn.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-16}}</ref>

'''Van''' ({{lang-hy|Վան}}; {{lang-ota|فان}}; {{lang-grc-x-medieval|Εύα}}, ''Eua'') is a city in eastern [[Turkey]]'s [[Van Province]], located on the eastern shore of [[Lake Van]]. The city has a long history as a major urban area. It has been a large city since the first millennium BC, initially as [[Tushpa]], the capital of the kingdom of [[Urartu]] from the 9th century BC to the 6th century BC, and later as the center of the Armenian kingdom of [[Vaspurakan]]. Today, Van has a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] majority and a sizeable [[Turkish people|Turkish]] minority.<ref name=\"Ozoglu\">{{cite journal|title=State–Tribe Relations: Kurdish Tribalism in the 16th-and 17th-Century Ottoman Empire|last=Özoğlu |first=Hakan|journal=British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies|volume=23 |issue=1|date=May 1996|pages=5–27|publisher=Taylor & Francis|doi=10.1080/13530199608705620}}</ref>

==History==
Archaeological excavations and surveys carried out in [[Van province]] indicate that the history of human settlement in this region goes back at least as far as 5000 BC. The Tilkitepe Mound, which is on the shores of Lake Van and a few kilometres to the south of [[Van Castle]], is the only source of information about the oldest culture of Van.

Under the ancient name of ''[[Tushpa]]'', Van was the capital of the [[Urartu|Urartian kingdom]] in the 9th century BC. The early settlement was centered on the steep-sided bluff now known as [[Van Castle]] (''Van Kalesi''), close to the edge of Lake Van and a few kilometers west of the modern city. Here have been found Urartian [[cuneiform]] inscriptions dating to the 8th and 7th centuries BC. In the trilingual [[Behistun]] [[inscription]], carved in the order of [[Darius the Great]] of [[Persia]], the country referred to as ''[[Urartu]]'' in Babylonian is called ''[[Armenia]]'' in Old Persian.

The name 'Van' comes from the [[Urartian language|Urartian]] ''Biaina''.<ref>Edmund Herzig, Marina Kurkchiyan, ''The Armenians: Past And Present In The Making Of National Identity'', p. 31</ref>

===Kingdom of Armenia===
The region came under the control of the [[Orontid dynasty|Orontids]] in the 7th century BC and quickly later the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in the mid 6th century BC. The [[Van Fortress]] located outside Van holds an inscribed stereotyped trilingual inscription of [[Xerxes the Great]] from the 5th century BC upon a smoothed section of the rock face, some {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} above the ground near the fortress. The inscription survives in near perfect condition and is divided into three columns of 27 lines written in (from left to right) [[Old Persian]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], and [[Elamite]]. In 331 BC, Van was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] and after his death became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. By the early 2nd century BC it was part of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. It became an important center during the reign of the [[Armenia]]n king, [[Tigranes II of Armenia|Tigranes II]], who founded the city of [[Tigranocerta|Tigranakert]] in the 1st century BC.<ref>The Journal of Roman Studies – Page 124 by Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies</ref> In the early centuries BC, it fell to the emerging [[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia]] until the 3rd century AD. However, it also fell once to the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia]] in this timespan. In the ''[[History of Armenia (Movses Khorenatsi)|History of Armenia]]'' attributed to [[Movses Khorenatsi]], the city is called ''Tosp'', from Urartian ''Tushpa''.<ref>http://rbedrosian.com/Classic/kvan1.htm</ref>

===Byzantines, Sassanids, and the Artsrunis===
{{Main|Vaspurakan}}
Following the fall of the Parthians and the emergence of the Neo-Persian Empire, better known as the [[Sassanian Empire]],<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sass/hd_sass.htm The Met Museum Website: The Sasanian Empire (224–651 A.D.)]</ref> the town naturally fell into the possession of the latter. During the over 700 years lasting [[Roman-Persian Wars]], some of the wars razed at or around the location of modern-day Van. The [[Byzantine Empire]] briefly held the region from 628 to 640, following the victory in the climactic [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]], after which it was invaded by the Muslim Arabs, who consolidated their conquests as the province of [[Arminiya]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9lHeh36S8ooC&pg=PT1462&lpg=PT1462&dq=arabs+consolidated+arminiya&source=bl&ots=POFYPrUuOa&sig=0j_GVrgMMeoHT6j4mQ9oKRxQ2fU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5-67O6rPRAhVKJCYKHc8wAlwQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&q=arabs%20consolidated%20arminiya&f=false The Cambridge Medieval History Series volumes 1–5 by Plantagenet Publishing, 2nd to last paragraph on the page linked to.

===Seljuk Empire===

Incursions by the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] Turks into Vaspurakan started in the 1050s. After their victory in 1071 at the [[battle of Manzikert]] the entire region fell under their control. After them, local Muslim rulers emerged, such as the [[Ahlatshahs]] and the [[Ayyubids]] (1207). For a 20-year period, Van was held by the [[Sultanate of Rûm|Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] until the 1240s when it was conquered by the [[Mongols]]. In the 14th century, Van was held by the [[Timurids]], followed subsequently by the Turkoman [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]] confederations.

===Turco-Iranian rivalry and the Ottoman era===
{{see also|Eyalet of Van|Vilayet of Van}}
The first half of the 15th century saw the Van region become a land of conflict as it was disputed by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the neighboring Persian [[Safavid]] Empire. The Safavids captured Van in 1502, as it went naturally with all former territories of the Ak Koyunlu. The Ottomans took the city in 1515 following the climactic [[Battle of Chaldiran]] and held it for a short period. The Safavids retook it again in 1520 but the Ottomans gained an almost definite hold of it in 1548 during another Ottoman-Safavid War. Ottoman control over the town got confirmed in the 1555 [[Peace of Amasya]] which came as a result after the end of the war. They first made Van into a [[sanjak]] dependent on the [[Erzurum eyalet]], and later into a separate [[Van eyalet]] in about 1570. In 1602, the Safavids under king [[Abbas the Great]] recaptured Van alongside other swaths of lost territories in Eastern Anatolia. However, Ottoman control over it was at last now made final and definite in 1639 with the [[Treaty of Zuhab]].

During the early 1900s, the city of Van had eleven Armenian schools and ten Turkish schools.<ref name=\"Hewsen-2000\">{{Armenian Van-Vaspurakan 2000|first=Robert H.|last=Hewsen|page=40|title=Van in This World: Paradise in the Next: The Historical Geography of Van/Vaspurakan.<br> Armenian churches within the walled city included Saint Tiramayr ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Տիրամայր}}), Saint Vardan ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Վարդան}}), Saint Poghos ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Պողոս}}), Saint Nshan ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Նշան}}), Saint Sahak ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Սահակ}}), and Saint Tsiranavor ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Ծիրանաւոր}}); in Aygestan ({{lang-hy|Այգեստան}}), Haykavank ({{lang-hy|Հայկավանք}}), Norashen ({{lang-hy|Նորաշէն}}), Arark ({{lang-hy|Արարք}}), Hankoysner, and other quarters each had a church.}}</ref> Towards the second half of the 19th century Van began to play an increased role in the politics of the Ottoman Empire due to its location near the borders of the Persian, Russian and Ottoman Empire, as well as its proximity to Mosul. During the period leading up to the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, Armenians were well represented in the local administration.<ref>Hewler, 39</ref>

====Demographics====
The demographics of Ottoman Van are a debated and contentious point as they relate directly to claims of ownership by either side prior to the outbreak of World War I. For the city of Van itself it's estimated that it had 50,000 inhabitants prior to World War I, of whom 30,000 were Armenian and 20,000 were Muslims. Based on the official 1914 Ottoman Census the population of Van province consisted of 179,422 Muslims and 67,797 Armenians.<ref>Values as printed in the [[:File:Proportions des populations en Asie Mineure statistique officielle d1914.png|official statistics from 1914]].</ref> The Ottoman Census figures include only male citizens, excluding women and children. According to a more recent research, the corrected estimates for the Van province (including women and children) are: 313,000 Muslims, 130,000 Armenians, and 65,000 others, including [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].<ref>Justin McCarthy: ''Muslims and Minorities.'' New York University Press, 1983, p. 110 f.</ref>

The demographics of Van are a greatly debated point, given the changing provincial borders. For example, in 1875 the province was divided; Van and Hakkari were separated, only to be rejoined in 1888, drastically changing the census numbers. Some writers argue that this merging was done to keep the Armenians from forming a majority.<ref>Hewsen, 35.</ref> In 1862 it was estimated that in Van there were 90,100 Christians (including [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]]) and 95,100 Muslims.<ref>[[Anahide Ter Minassian]]: \"The city of Van at the Turn of the Twentieth Century.\" In: Richard G. Hovannisian: ''Armenian Van/Vaspurakan.'' Mazda Publishers, Costa Mesa/CA 2000, p. 179.</ref> The French Consul in Van reported that in Van and Bitlis 51.46% were [[Kurds]], 32.70% were Armenians and 5.53% were Turks.<ref>Minassian, 180.</ref> On the other hand, the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople estimated 185,000 Armenians in Van, 18,000 Assyrians, 72,000 Kurds, 47,000 Turks, 25,000 [[Yezidi]]s and 3,000 [[Gypsie]]s.<ref>Minassian, 181.</ref> Both sides have been accused of overcounting the numbers at the time given the revival of the [[Armenian Question]] and population statistics became important during the [[Berlin Conference]].<ref>Sarkis Y.

===The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878===

During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)]], the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] Sheikh, Jalaleddin, led thousands of soldiers to massacre the Armenians of the province and destroyed and plundered many of their villages.<ref>[https://www.sophenearmeniaca.com/2019/03/06/who-was-sheikh-jalaleddin/ Who Was Sheikh Jalaleddin?]</ref> These events are characterized in the non-fiction book ''Armenia and the Campaign of 1877'' by British war correspondent Charles B. Norman and in the fictional novella [[Jalaleddin (novella)|''Jalaleddin'']] by the Armenian novelist [[Raffi (novelist)|Raffi]] in very similar terms.<ref>[https://www.sophenearmeniaca.com/2019/01/06/jalaleddin-and-the-russo-turkish-war-of-1877-1878/ Jalaleddin and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878]</ref>

===World War I and Armenian Genocide===

Some scholars explain that the [[Armenian resistance during World War I|Armenians launched a rebellion]] at Van in 1915, lured by Russian promises of independence. Other scholars argue that the Armenian residents, hoping to avoid the slaughter being inflicted on the rural populations surrounding Van, defended themselves in the Armenian quarters of the city against the Turks.<ref name=\"gens\">The Banality of Indifference: Zionism and the Armenian Genocide – Page 42 by Yaïr Auron</ref> The Russians finally relieved the Armenian defenders of Van in late May 1915. In August, a victory over the Russian army allowed the Ottoman army to retake Van. In September 1915, the Russians forced the Turks out of Van for the second time. Russian forces began to leave the area after the [[October Revolution]] in Russia in 1917, and by April 1918, it was recaptured by the Ottoman army. According to Taner Akçam, citing the ''Osmanli Belgelerinde Ermeniler 1915–1920'' (Armenians in Ottoman Documents, 1915–1920), after the Turks took back the city from the Russians, they killed all Armenians in the city.<ref>Akçam, p. 140</ref> [[Clarence Ussher]], an American physician and missionary in Van, and an eye-witness to the events, reported that 55,000 Armenians had been killed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rubenstein|first=Richard L.|title=Jihad and genocide|year=2010|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0742562028|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYez6YcL-B8C|edition=1st pbk.}}</ref><ref name=Sjacobs>{{cite book|last=L.

===Turkish War of Independence and Republic===
[[File:Van City, Turkey overview 2011.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The center of modern Van seen from the castle rock]]
In the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] decided to cede the city to the [[First Republic of Armenia]]. [[Turkish revolutionaries]], led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] rejected the terms of the treaty and instead waged the [[Turkish War of Independence]].  However the idea of ceding Van to the Armenians was floated, and Ismet Inonu was said to have surveyed army officers on 14 October 1919 on the issue of ceding Van and Bitlis. However the parliament in Ankara rejected any compromise on this issue.<ref>Akçam, Taner. \"A shameful Act.\" Translated by Paul Bessemer. Metropolitan Books, New York. 2006.</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} By 1920, Van fell under Turkish control again and its remaining Armenian inhabitants were expelled in a final round of [[ethnic cleansing]].<ref name=\"gens\"/> With the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] and [[Treaty of Kars]], the Treaty of Sèvres was annulled and Van remained de facto under Turkish sovereignty.

By the end of the conflicts, the town of Van was empty and in ruins. The city was rebuilt after the war a few kilometers east of the ancient citadel, which is now known as [[Van Castle]] (''Van Kalesi''). The city now lies at about {{convert|1,750|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

The city is home to [[Van Yüzüncü Yıl Üniversitesi]] (''Van 100th Year University'') and recently came to the headlines for two highly publicized investigations initiated by the Prosecutor of Van, one of which was focused on accusations against the university's [[Rector (academia)|rector]], Prof. [[Hasan Ceylan]], who was kept in custody for a time. He was finally acquitted but lost his rectorate. He is a grandson of [[Güllü Agop|Agop Vartovyan]], an Ottoman Armenian who is accepted as the founder of modern Turkish theatre. Prof. Hasan Ceylan is also the department chairman of Environmental Engineering in the Van 100th Year University.

In 1941, Van suffered a destructive [[1941 Van–Erciş earthquake|5.9 M<sub>w</sub> earthquake]]. A more severe [[2011 Van earthquake|7.2 M<sub>w</sub> earthquake]] occurred on October 23, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/23/world/europe/turkey-earthquake/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 | title = Report: Death toll rises to 217 after massive earthquake in Turkey | date = 2011-10-24 | accessdate = 2011-10-24 | publisher=CNN}}</ref> On November 9, 2011, a 5.7 magnitude earthquake caused several buildings to collapse.

==Transport==
Van stands on Highway D300, which runs from the Iranian border 100&nbsp;km east at Kapikoy through Van then along the south lake shore to [[Tatvan]] (100&nbsp;km), and westwards to the rest of Turkey. Highway D975 runs north to Dogubeyazit and south towards Hakkari. Frequent buses and dolmuses ply these highways.

Van is the western terminus of the railway line from Iran, with freight and passenger trains (suspended between 2015 and 2018). There is a [[train ferry]] (upgraded in 2015) across the lake to Tatvan. There is no railway around the lake; it is intended eventually to build one but to date there are no plans. This would actually create an unbroken rail link between Europe and the Indian subcontinent, as Tatvan is the terminus of the line to Ankara and Istanbul.

Van has daily flights to Istanbul, Ankara and other major Turkish cities from  [[Van Ferit Melen Airport|Ferit Melen Airport]].

The city has a long history as a major urban area. It has been a large city since the first millennium BC, initially as [[Tushpa]], the capital of the kingdom of [[Urartu]] from the 9th century BC to the 6th century BC, and later as the center of the Armenian kingdom of [[Vaspurakan]].

==History==
Archaeological excavations and surveys carried out in [[Van province]] indicate that the history of human settlement in this region goes back at least as far as 5000 BC. The Tilkitepe Mound, which is on the shores of Lake Van and a few kilometres to the south of [[Van Castle]], is the only source of information about the oldest culture of Van.

===Urartu===
[[File:Xerxes Cuneiform Van.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Xerxes I's inscription at Van|Inscription of Xerxes the Great]] on the cliffs below [[Van Fortress|Van castle]].]]
[[File:Akhtamar Island on Lake Van with the Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Lake Van]]]]

Under the ancient name of ''[[Tushpa]]'', Van was the capital of the [[Urartu|Urartian kingdom]] in the 9th century BC. The early settlement was centered on the steep-sided bluff now known as [[Van Castle]] (''Van Kalesi''), close to the edge of Lake Van and a few kilometers west of the modern city. Here have been found Urartian [[cuneiform]] inscriptions dating to the 8th and 7th centuries BC. In the trilingual [[Behistun]] [[inscription]], carved in the order of [[Darius the Great]] of [[Persia]], the country referred to as ''[[Urartu]]'' in Babylonian is called ''[[Armenia]]'' in Old Persian.

The name 'Van' comes from the [[Urartian language|Urartian]] ''Biaina''.<ref>Edmund Herzig, Marina Kurkchiyan, ''The Armenians: Past And Present In The Making Of National Identity'', p. 31</ref>

===Kingdom of Armenia===
The region came under the control of the [[Orontid dynasty|Orontids]] in the 7th century BC and quickly later the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in the mid 6th century BC. The [[Van Fortress]] located outside Van holds an inscribed stereotyped trilingual inscription of [[Xerxes the Great]] from the 5th century BC upon a smoothed section of the rock face, some {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} above the ground near the fortress. The inscription survives in near perfect condition and is divided into three columns of 27 lines written in (from left to right) [[Old Persian]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], and [[Elamite]]. In 331 BC, Van was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] and after his death became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. By the early 2nd century BC it was part of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. It became an important center during the reign of the [[Armenia]]n king, [[Tigranes II of Armenia|Tigranes II]], who founded the city of [[Tigranocerta|Tigranakert]] in the 1st century BC.<ref>The Journal of Roman Studies – Page 124 by Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies</ref> In the early centuries BC, it fell to the emerging [[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia]] until the 3rd century AD. However, it also fell once to the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia]] in this timespan. In the ''[[History of Armenia (Movses Khorenatsi)|History of Armenia]]'' attributed to [[Movses Khorenatsi]], the city is called ''Tosp'', from Urartian ''Tushpa''.<ref>http://rbedrosian.com/Classic/kvan1.htm</ref>

===Byzantines, Sassanids, and the Artsrunis===
{{Main|Vaspurakan}}
Following the fall of the Parthians and the emergence of the Neo-Persian Empire, better known as the [[Sassanian Empire]],<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sass/hd_sass.htm The Met Museum Website: The Sasanian Empire (224–651 A.D.)]</ref> the town naturally fell into the possession of the latter. During the over 700 years lasting [[Roman-Persian Wars]], some of the wars razed at or around the location of modern-day Van. The [[Byzantine Empire]] briefly held the region from 628 to 640, following the victory in the climactic [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]], after which it was invaded by the Muslim Arabs, who consolidated their conquests as the province of [[Arminiya]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9lHeh36S8ooC&pg=PT1462&lpg=PT1462&dq=arabs+consolidated+arminiya&source=bl&ots=POFYPrUuOa&sig=0j_GVrgMMeoHT6j4mQ9oKRxQ2fU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5-67O6rPRAhVKJCYKHc8wAlwQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&q=arabs%20consolidated%20arminiya&f=false The Cambridge Medieval History Series volumes 1–5 by Plantagenet Publishing, 2nd to last paragraph on the page linked to.

===Seljuk Empire===

Incursions by the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] Turks into Vaspurakan started in the 1050s. After their victory in 1071 at the [[battle of Manzikert]] the entire region fell under their control. After them, local Muslim rulers emerged, such as the [[Ahlatshahs]] and the [[Ayyubids]] (1207). For a 20-year period, Van was held by the [[Sultanate of Rûm|Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] until the 1240s when it was conquered by the [[Mongols]]. In the 14th century, Van was held by the [[Timurids]], followed subsequently by the Turkoman [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]] confederations.

===Turco-Iranian rivalry and the Ottoman era===
{{see also|Eyalet of Van|Vilayet of Van}}
The first half of the 15th century saw the Van region become a land of conflict as it was disputed by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the neighboring Persian [[Safavid]] Empire. The Safavids captured Van in 1502, as it went naturally with all former territories of the Ak Koyunlu. The Ottomans took the city in 1515 following the climactic [[Battle of Chaldiran]] and held it for a short period. The Safavids retook it again in 1520 but the Ottomans gained an almost definite hold of it in 1548 during another Ottoman-Safavid War. Ottoman control over the town got confirmed in the 1555 [[Peace of Amasya]] which came as a result after the end of the war. They first made Van into a [[sanjak]] dependent on the [[Erzurum eyalet]], and later into a separate [[Van eyalet]] in about 1570. In 1602, the Safavids under king [[Abbas the Great]] recaptured Van alongside other swaths of lost territories in Eastern Anatolia. However, Ottoman control over it was at last now made final and definite in 1639 with the [[Treaty of Zuhab]].

[[File:The Rock and Walled City of Van (1893).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The rock and walled city of Van in 1893 by [[H. F. B. Lynch]].]]

During the early 1900s, the city of Van had eleven Armenian schools and ten Turkish schools.<ref name=\"Hewsen-2000\">{{Armenian Van-Vaspurakan 2000|first=Robert H.|last=Hewsen|page=40|title=Van in This World: Paradise in the Next: The Historical Geography of Van/Vaspurakan.<br> Armenian churches within the walled city included Saint Tiramayr ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Տիրամայր}}), Saint Vardan ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Վարդան}}), Saint Poghos ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Պողոս}}), Saint Nshan ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Նշան}}), Saint Sahak ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Սահակ}}), and Saint Tsiranavor ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Ծիրանաւոր}}); in Aygestan ({{lang-hy|Այգեստան}}), Haykavank ({{lang-hy|Հայկավանք}}), Norashen ({{lang-hy|Նորաշէն}}), Arark ({{lang-hy|Արարք}}), Hankoysner, and other quarters each had a church.}}</ref> Towards the second half of the 19th century Van began to play an increased role in the politics of the Ottoman Empire due to its location near the borders of the Persian, Russian and Ottoman Empire, as well as its proximity to Mosul. During the period leading up to the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, Armenians were well represented in the local administration.<ref>Hewler, 39</ref>

====Demographics====
The demographics of Ottoman Van are a debated and contentious point as they relate directly to claims of ownership by either side prior to the outbreak of World War I. For the city of Van itself it's estimated that it had 50,000 inhabitants prior to World War I, of whom 30,000 were Armenian and 20,000 were Muslims. Based on the official 1914 Ottoman Census the population of Van province consisted of 179,422 Muslims and 67,797 Armenians.<ref>Values as printed in the [[:File:Proportions des populations en Asie Mineure statistique officielle d1914.png|official statistics from 1914]].</ref> The Ottoman Census figures include only male citizens, excluding women and children. According to a more recent research, the corrected estimates for the Van province (including women and children) are: 313,000 Muslims, 130,000 Armenians, and 65,000 others, including [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].<ref>Justin McCarthy: ''Muslims and Minorities.'' New York University Press, 1983, p. 110 f.</ref>

The demographics of Van are a greatly debated point, given the changing provincial borders. For example, in 1875 the province was divided; Van and Hakkari were separated, only to be rejoined in 1888, drastically changing the census numbers. Some writers argue that this merging was done to keep the Armenians from forming a majority.<ref>Hewsen, 35.</ref> In 1862 it was estimated that in Van there were 90,100 Christians (including [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]]) and 95,100 Muslims.<ref>[[Anahide Ter Minassian]]: \"The city of Van at the Turn of the Twentieth Century.\" In: Richard G. Hovannisian: ''Armenian Van/Vaspurakan.'' Mazda Publishers, Costa Mesa/CA 2000, p. 179.</ref> The French Consul in Van reported that in Van and Bitlis 51.46% were [[Kurds]], 32.70% were Armenians and 5.53% were Turks.<ref>Minassian, 180.</ref> On the other hand, the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople estimated 185,000 Armenians in Van, 18,000 Assyrians, 72,000 Kurds, 47,000 Turks, 25,000 [[Yezidi]]s and 3,000 [[Gypsie]]s.<ref>Minassian, 181.</ref> Both sides have been accused of overcounting the numbers at the time given the revival of the [[Armenian Question]] and population statistics became important during the [[Berlin Conference]].<ref>Sarkis Y. Karayan: \"Demography of Van Province, 1844–1914\". In: [[Richard G. Hovannisian]]: ''Armenian Van/Vaspurakan''. Mazda Publishers, Costa Mesa/CA 2000, p. 196.</ref>

===The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878===

During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)]], the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] Sheikh, Jalaleddin, led thousands of soldiers to massacre the Armenians of the province and destroyed and plundered many of their villages.<ref>[https://www.sophenearmeniaca.com/2019/03/06/who-was-sheikh-jalaleddin/ Who Was Sheikh Jalaleddin?]</ref> These events are characterized in the non-fiction book ''Armenia and the Campaign of 1877'' by British war correspondent Charles B.

Some scholars explain that the [[Armenian resistance during World War I|Armenians launched a rebellion]] at Van in 1915, lured by Russian promises of independence. Other scholars argue that the Armenian residents, hoping to avoid the slaughter being inflicted on the rural populations surrounding Van, defended themselves in the Armenian quarters of the city against the Turks.<ref name=\"gens\">The Banality of Indifference: Zionism and the Armenian Genocide – Page 42 by Yaïr Auron</ref> The Russians finally relieved the Armenian defenders of Van in late May 1915. In August, a victory over the Russian army allowed the Ottoman army to retake Van. In September 1915, the Russians forced the Turks out of Van for the second time. Russian forces began to leave the area after the [[October Revolution]] in Russia in 1917, and by April 1918, it was recaptured by the Ottoman army. According to Taner Akçam, citing the ''Osmanli Belgelerinde Ermeniler 1915–1920'' (Armenians in Ottoman Documents, 1915–1920), after the Turks took back the city from the Russians, they killed all Armenians in the city.<ref>Akçam, p. 140</ref> [[Clarence Ussher]], an American physician and missionary in Van, and an eye-witness to the events, reported that 55,000 Armenians had been killed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rubenstein|first=Richard L.|title=Jihad and genocide|year=2010|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0742562028|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYez6YcL-B8C|edition=1st pbk.}}</ref><ref name=Sjacobs>{{cite book|last=L.

===Turkish War of Independence and Republic===
[[File:Van City, Turkey overview 2011.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The center of modern Van seen from the castle rock]]
In the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] decided to cede the city to the [[First Republic of Armenia]]. [[Turkish revolutionaries]], led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] rejected the terms of the treaty and instead waged the [[Turkish War of Independence]].  However the idea of ceding Van to the Armenians was floated, and Ismet Inonu was said to have surveyed army officers on 14 October 1919 on the issue of ceding Van and Bitlis. However the parliament in Ankara rejected any compromise on this issue.<ref>Akçam, Taner. \"A shameful Act.\" Translated by Paul Bessemer. Metropolitan Books, New York. 2006.</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} By 1920, Van fell under Turkish control again and its remaining Armenian inhabitants were expelled in a final round of [[ethnic cleansing]].<ref name=\"gens\"/> With the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] and [[Treaty of Kars]], the Treaty of Sèvres was annulled and Van remained de facto under Turkish sovereignty.

By the end of the conflicts, the town of Van was empty and in ruins. The city was rebuilt after the war a few kilometers east of the ancient citadel, which is now known as [[Van Castle]] (''Van Kalesi''). The city now lies at about {{convert|1,750|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

===Landmarks===
The modern city is located on the plain extending from the [[Lake Van]], at a distance of {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=off}} from the lake shore.

Van has often been called \"The Pearl of the East\" because of the beauty of its surrounding landscape. An old Armenian proverb in the same sense is \"Van in this world, paradise in the next.\"<ref>{{Cite book| last = Hewsen | first = Robert H. | title = Armenia: A Historical Atlas | year = 2001 | publisher = [[The University of Chicago Press]] | isbn = 0-226-33228-4 | pages = 207 }}</ref> This phrase has been slightly modified in Turkish as ''dünyada Van, ahirette iman'' or \"Van for this world, faith for the next.\"

The city is home to [[Van Yüzüncü Yıl Üniversitesi]] (''Van 100th Year University'') and recently came to the headlines for two highly publicized investigations initiated by the Prosecutor of Van, one of which was focused on accusations against the university's [[Rector (academia)|rector]], Prof. [[Hasan Ceylan]], who was kept in custody for a time. He was finally acquitted but lost his rectorate. He is a grandson of [[Güllü Agop|Agop Vartovyan]], an Ottoman Armenian who is accepted as the founder of modern Turkish theatre. Prof. Hasan Ceylan is also the department chairman of Environmental Engineering in the Van 100th Year University.

In 1941, Van suffered a destructive [[1941 Van–Erciş earthquake|5.9 M<sub>w</sub> earthquake]]. A more severe [[2011 Van earthquake|7.2 M<sub>w</sub> earthquake]] occurred on October 23, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/23/world/europe/turkey-earthquake/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 | title = Report: Death toll rises to 217 after massive earthquake in Turkey | date = 2011-10-24 | accessdate = 2011-10-24 | publisher=CNN}}</ref> On November 9, 2011, a 5.7 magnitude earthquake caused several buildings to collapse.

==Transport==
Van stands on Highway D300, which runs from the Iranian border 100&nbsp;km east at Kapikoy through Van then along the south lake shore to [[Tatvan]] (100&nbsp;km), and westwards to the rest of Turkey. Highway D975 runs north to Dogubeyazit and south towards Hakkari. Frequent buses and dolmuses ply these highways.

Van is the western terminus of the railway line from Iran, with freight and passenger trains (suspended between 2015 and 2018). There is a [[train ferry]] (upgraded in 2015) across the lake to Tatvan. There is no railway around the lake; it is intended eventually to build one but to date there are no plans. This would actually create an unbroken rail link between Europe and the Indian subcontinent, as Tatvan is the terminus of the line to Ankara and Istanbul.

Van has daily flights to Istanbul, Ankara and other major Turkish cities from  [[Van Ferit Melen Airport|Ferit Melen Airport]].

==Media==
Near Van, there is a [[longwave]] broadcasting station with a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=mid|-tall}} guyed mast. It went in service in 1990 and operates on 225&nbsp;kHz with 600&nbsp;kW.

The term '''Dirac matter''' refers to a class of [[condensed matter]] systems which can be effectively described by the [[Dirac equation]]. Even though the [[Dirac equation]] itself was formulated for [[fermions]], the quasi-particles present within Dirac matter can be of any statistics. As a consequence, Dirac matter can be distinguished in [[fermionic]], [[bosonic]] or [[anyon]]ic Dirac matter. Prominent examples of Dirac matter are [[Graphene]], [[topological insulators]], Dirac semimetals, [[Weyl semimetal]]s, various [[high-temperature superconductors]] with <math>d</math>-wave pairing and [[Helium-3|liquid Helium-3]]. The effective theory of such systems is classified by a specific choice of the [[Dirac mass]], the Dirac velocity, the [[Dirac matrices]] and the [[space-time curvature]]. The universal treatment of the class of Dirac matter in terms of an effective theory leads to a common features with respect to the [[density of states]], the [[heat capacity]] and impurity scattering.

== Definition ==
Members of the class of Dirac matter differ significantly in nature. However, all examples of Dirac matter are unified by similarities within the algebraic structure of an effective theory describing them.

=== General ===

The general definition of Dirac matter is a condensed matter system where the [[quasi-particle]] excitations can be described in curved spacetime by the generalised Dirac equation:
:<math>
 \\left[i \\hbar v_D \\gamma^a e_a^\\mu d_\\mu(p) - m v_D^2\\right]\\Psi = 0.
</math>
In the above definition <math>d_\\mu</math> denotes a [[covariant vector]] depending on the <math>(d+1)</math>-dimensional momentum <math>p</math> (<math>d</math> space <math>+ 1</math> time dimension), <math>e_a^\\mu</math> is the [[vierbein]] describing the curvature of the space, <math>m</math> the [[quasi-particle]] mass and <math>v_D</math> the Dirac velocity. Note that since in Dirac matter the Dirac equation gives the effective theory of the quasiparticles, the energy from the mass term is <math>m v_D^2</math>, not the rest mass <math>m c^2</math> of a massive particle. <math>\\gamma^\\mu</math> refers to a set of [[Dirac matrices]], where the defining for the construction is given by the anticommutation relation,
:<math>
  \\left\\{\\gamma^\\mu,\\gamma^\\nu \\right\\} = \\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu + \\gamma^\\nu\\gamma^\\mu = \\eta^{\\mu\\nu} I_d.
</math>
<math>\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}</math> is the [[Minkowski metric]] with signature (+ - - -) and <math>I_d</math> is the <math>d\\times d</math>-dimensional unit matrix.
In all equations, implicit summation over <math>a</math> and <math>\\mu</math> is used ([[Einstein convention]]). Furthermore, <math>\\Psi</math> is the [[wavefunction]]. The unifying feature of all Dirac matter is the matrix structure of the equation describing the quasi-particle excitations.

In the limit where <math>d_\\mu(p) = D_\\mu</math>, i.e. the [[covariant derivative]], conventional Dirac matter is obtained. However, this general definition allows the description of matter with higher order dispersion relations and in curved spacetime as long as the effective [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] exhibits the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] structure specific to the [[Dirac equation]].

=== Common (conventional) ===

The majority of experimental realisations of Dirac matter to date are in the limit of <math>d_\\mu (p) = D_\\mu</math> which therefore defines conventional Dirac matter in which the quasiparticles are described by the [[Dirac equation in curved spacetime|Dirac equation in curved space-time]],
:<math>
 \\left[i \\hbar v_D \\gamma^a e_a^\\mu D_\\mu - m v_D^2\\right]\\Psi = 0.
</math>
Here, <math>D_\\mu</math> denotes the [[covariant derivative]]. As an example, for the flat metric, the energy of a free Dirac particle differs significantly from the classical kinetic energy where energy is proportional to momentum squared:
:<math>
\\begin{align}
\\mathrm{Free~Dirac~particle: \\;} E &= \\pm \\sqrt{\\hbar^2 v_D^2\\mathbf{k}^2+m^2c^4} \\\\
\\mathrm{Kinetic\\; energy: \\;} E &= \\frac{m |\\mathbf{v}|^2}{2} = \\frac{|\\mathbf{k}|^2}{2m}.
\\end{align}
</math>
The Dirac velocity <math>v_D</math> gives the gradient of the <math>E-k</math> dispersion at large momenta <math>k</math>, <math>m</math> is the mass of particle or object. In the case of massless Dirac matter, such as the fermionic quasiparticles in [[graphene]] or [[Weyl semimetal]]s, the energy-momentum relation is linear,
:<math>
 E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\hbar v_D |\\mathbf{k}|
</math>

Therefore, conventional Dirac matter includes all systems that have a linear crossing or linear behavior in some region of the energy-momentum relation. They are characterised by features that resemble an 'X', sometimes tilted or skewed and sometimes with a gap between the upper <math>\\vee</math> and lower <math>\\wedge</math> parts (the turning points of which become rounded if the origin of the gap is a mass term).

The general features and some specific examples of conventional Dirac matter are discussed in the following sections.

== General properties of Dirac matter ==

=== Technological relevance and tuning of Dirac matter ===

[[File:Tuning of Dirac matter.png|thumb|Tuning of Dirac matter: As the density of states is well defined, the density of states at the Fermi level (for fermionic Dirac matter) can be nicely tuned by shifting the chemical potential <math>\\mu</math>. Additionally, introducing a mass term <math>m</math> leads to a gap between the two cones and the dispersion becomes quadratic near <math>k=0</math>.]]

Dirac matter, especially fermionic Dirac matter has much potential for technological applications. For example, 2010's [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to [[Andre Geim]] and [[Konstantin Novoselov]] \"for groundbreaking experiments regarding the material graphene\". Within the official press release of the [[Swedish Royal Academy of Science]] it is stated that<ref name=\"nobelprize\">[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/press.pdf The Nobel Prize in Physics 2010]</ref>
{{Quote
|text=
[...] a vast variety of practical applications now appear possible including the creation of new materials and the manufacture of innovative electronics. Graphene transistors are predicted to be substantially faster than today’s silicon transistors and result in more efficient computers.

}}

In general, the properties of massless fermionic Dirac matter can be controlled by shifting the [[chemical potential]] by means of [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] or within a [[field effect (semiconductor)|field effect]] setup. By tuning the [[chemical potential]], it is possible to have a precise control of the number of states present, since the [[density of states]] varies in a well-defined way with energy.

Additionally, depending on the specific realization of the Dirac material, it may be possible to introduce a mass term <math>m</math> that opens a gap in the spectrum - a [[band gap]]. In general, the mass term is the result of breaking a specific symmetry of the system. The size of the [[band gap]] can be controlled precisely by controlling the strength of the mass term.

=== Density of states ===

=== Specific heat ===
Specific heat, the [[heat capacity]] per unit mass, describes the energy required to change the temperature of a sample. The low-temperature electronic [[specific heat]] of Dirac matter is <math>C(T\\to 0)\\sim T^d</math> which is different from <math>C(T\\to 0)\\sim T</math> encountered for normal metals.<ref name=\"wehling2014dirac\"/> Therefore, for systems whose physical dimension is greater than 1, the specific heat can provide a clear signature of the underlying Dirac nature of the quasiparticles.

=== Landau quantization ===
[[Landau quantization]] refers to the quantization of the cyclotron orbits of charged particles in magnetic fields. As a result, the charged particles can only occupy orbits with discrete energy values, called Landau levels. For 2-dimensional systems with a perpendicular magnetic field, the energy for Landau-levels for ordinary matter described the Schrödinger equation and Dirac matter are given by<ref name=\"wehling2014dirac\"/>
:<math>
\\begin{align}
\\mathrm{Ordinary\\;matter: \\;} E &= \\hbar \\omega_c \\left(n+\\frac{1}{2} \\right), \\\\
\\mathrm{Dirac\\;Matter: \\;} E &= \\hbar \\omega_c \\sqrt{|n|}.
\\end{align}
</math>
Here, <math>\\omega_c</math> is the [[cyclotron frequency]] which is linearly dependent of the applied magnetic field and the charge of the particle. There are two distinct features between the Landau level quantization for 2D Schrödinger fermions (ordinary matter) and 2D Dirac fermions. First, the energy for Schrödinger fermions is linearly dependent with respect to the integer quantum number <math>n</math>, whereas it exhibits a square-root dependence for the Dirac fermions. This key difference plays an important role in the experimental verification of Dirac matter.<ref name=\"novoselov2005two\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04233|pmid=16281030|title=Two-dimensional gas of massless Dirac fermions in graphene|journal=Nature|volume=438|issue=7065|pages=197–200|year=2005|last1=Novoselov|first1=K.

== Fermionic Dirac matter ==
In the context of Fermionic quasiparticles, the Dirac velocity is identical to the Fermi velocity; in bosonic systems, no Fermi velocity exists, so the Dirac velocity is a more general property of such systems.

=== Graphene ===
[[Graphene]] is a 2-dimensional crystalline [[allotrope]] of [[carbon]], where the carbon atoms are arranged on a [[hexagonal lattice]].
Each carbon atom forms <math>\\sigma</math>-bonds to the three neighboring atoms that lie in the graphene plane at angles of 120<math>^\\circ</math>. These bonds are mediated by three of carbon's four [[electrons]] while the fourth electron, which occupies a <math>\\mathrm{p}_z</math> [[Atomic orbital|orbital]], mediates an out-of-plane [[pi-bond|{{pi}}-bond]] that leads to the [[Electronic band structure|electronic bands]] at the [[Fermi level]]. The unique transport properties and the [[semimetal]]lic state of graphene are the result of the delocalized electrons occupying these p<math>_z</math> orbitals.<ref name=\"abergel2010properties\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00018732.2010.487978|title=Properties of graphene: A theoretical perspective|journal=Advances in Physics|volume=59|issue=4|pages=261–482|year=2010|last1=Abergel|first1=D.S.L|last2=Apalkov|first2=V|last3=Berashevich|first3=J|last4=Ziegler|first4=K|last5=Chakraborty|first5=Tapash|arxiv=1003.0391}}</ref>

The semimetallic state corresponds to a linear crossing of energy bands at the <math>K</math> and <math>K'</math> points of graphene's hexagonal [[Brillouin zone]]. At these two points, the electronic structure can be effectively described by the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]
:<math>
{\\cal H} = \\hbar v_D \\left(\\tau k_x \\sigma_x + k_y \\sigma_y \\right). 
</math>
Here, <math>\\sigma_x</math> and <math>\\sigma_y</math> are two of the three [[Pauli matrices]].
The factor <math>\\tau=+/-</math> indicates whether the Hamiltonian describes is centred on the <math>K</math> or <math>K'</math> valley at the corner of hexagonal [[Brillouin zone]]. For graphene, the Dirac velocity is about <math>\\hbar v_D \\approx 5.8</math> eV <math>\\AA</math>.<ref name=\"abergel2010properties\"/> An energy gap in the dispersion of graphene can be obtained from a low-energy Hamiltionain of the form

\\begin{align}
{\\cal H} = \\hbar v_D (\\tau k_x \\sigma_x + k_y\\sigma_y) + M \\sigma_z,
\\end{align}

There are several distinct ways of introducing a mass term, and the results have different characteristics.<ref name=\"haldane\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.2015|pmid=10038961|title=Model for a Quantum Hall Effect without Landau Levels: Condensed-Matter Realization of the \"Parity Anomaly\"|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=61|issue=18|pages=2015–2018|year=1988|last1=Haldane|first1=F.

=== Topological insulators ===
A [[topological insulator]] is a material that behaves as an insulator in its interior (bulk) but whose surface contains conducting states. This property represents a non-trivial, symmetry protected [[topological order]]. As a consequence, electrons in topological insulators can only move along the [[Interface (matter)|surface]] of the material. In the bulk of a non-interacting topological insulator, the [[Fermi level]] is positioned within the gap between the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction and valence bands]]. On the surface, there are special states within the bulk [[energy gap]] which can be effectively described by a Dirac Hamiltonian: 
:<math>
\\begin{align}
{\\cal H} = \\hbar v_{D} (\\mathbf{k}\\times \\mathbf{\\sigma})\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}
\\end{align}
</math>
where <math>\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}</math> is normal to the surface and <math>{\\mathbf{\\sigma}}</math> is in the real [[spin (physics)|spin]] basis. However, if we rotate spin by a [[unitary operator]], <math>U={\\rm diag}[1,i]</math>, we will end up with the standard notation of Dirac Hamiltonian, <math>{\\cal H} = \\hbar v_{D} {\\mathbf{\\sigma}}\\cdot {\\mathbf{k}}</math>.

One distinct, experimentally observable feature of Weyl semimetals is that the surface states form [[Fermi arc]]s since the [[Fermi surface]] does not form a closed loop.

=== Dirac semimetals ===
In crystals that are symmetric under [[point reflection|inversion]] and [[T-symmetry|time reversal]], electronic energy bands are two-fold degenerate. This degeneracy is referred to as [[Kramers degeneracy]]. Therefore, semimetals with linear crossings of two energy bands (two-fold degeneracy) at the [[Fermi energy]] exhibit a four-fold degeneracy at the crossing point. The effective [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for these states can be written as 
:<math>
{\\cal H} = \\hbar v_D \\left(
\\begin{array}{cc}
 \\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma} & 0 \\\\
 0 & -\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}

== Bosonic Dirac matter ==
[[File:Dispersions for bosonic (left) and fermionic (right) Dirac materials.png|thumb|Dispersions for bosonic (left) and fermionic (right) Dirac materials. In contrast to the fermionic case where Pauli exclusion confines excitations close to the Fermi energy, the description of boson requires the entire Brillioun zone.]]
While historic interest focussed on fermionic quasiparticles that have potential for technological applications, particularly in electronics, the mathematical structure of the [[Dirac equation]] is not restricted to the [[Particle statistics|statistics of the particles]]. This has led to recent development of the concept of bosonic Dirac matter.

In the case of [[bosons]], there is no [[Pauli exclusion principle]] to confine excitations close to the [[chemical potential]] (Fermi energy for fermions) so the entire [[Brillouin zone]] must be included. At low temperatures, the bosons will collect at the lowest energy point, the <math>\\Gamma</math>-point of the lower band. Energy must be added to excite the quasiparticles to the vicinity of the linear crossing point.

Several examples of Dirac matter with fermionic quasi-particles occur in systems where there is a hexagonal crystal lattice; so bosonic quasiparticles on an hexagonal lattice are the natural candidates for bosonic Dirac matter. In fact, the underlying symmetry of a crystal structure strongly constrains and protects the emergence of linear band crossings. Typical bosonic [[quasiparticles]] in [[condensed matter]] are [[magnon]]s, [[phonons]], [[polaritons]] and [[plasmons]].

Existing examples of bosonic Dirac matter include transition metal [[halides]] such as CrX<math>_3</math> (X= Cl, Br, I), where the [[magnon]] spectrum exhibits linear crossings,<ref name=\"pershoguba2018dirac\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.8.011010|title=Dirac Magnons in Honeycomb Ferromagnets|journal=Physical Review X|volume=8|issue=1|pages=011010|year=2018|last1=Pershoguba|first1=Sergey S|last2=Banerjee|first2=Saikat|last3=Lashley|first3=J. C|last4=Park|first4=Jihwey|last5=Ågren|first5=Hans|last6=Aeppli|first6=Gabriel|last7=Balatsky|first7=Alexander V|arxiv=1706.03384|bibcode=2018PhRvX...8a1010P}}</ref> granular [[superconductors]] in a [[honeycomb lattice]] <ref name=\"Banerjee\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.93.134502|title=Granular superconductor in a honeycomb lattice as a realization of bosonic Dirac material|journal=Physical Review B|volume=93|issue=13|pages=134502|year=2016|last1=Banerjee|first1=S|last2=Fransson|first2=J|last3=Black-Schaffer|first3=A.

== Anyonic Dirac materials ==
Anyonic Dirac matter is a hypothetical field which is rather unexplored to date. An [[anyon]] is a type of quasiparticle that can only occur in two-dimensional systems. Considering [[bosons]] and [[fermions]], the interchange of two particles contributes a factor of 1 or -1 to the wave function. In contrast, the operation of exchanging two identical anyons causes a global phase shift. Anyons are generally classified as ''abelian'' or ''non-abelian,'' according to whether the elementary excitations of the theory transform under an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[group representation|representation]] of the [[braid group]] or a non-abelian one.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(91)90407-O |url=http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~gmoore/MooreReadNonabelions.pdf |title=Nonabelions in the fractional quantum hall effect |date=19 Aug 1991 |last1=Moore |first1=Gregory |authorlink1=Greg Moore (physicist) |last2=Read |first2=Nicholas |authorlink2=Nicholas Read |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=360 |issue=2–3 |pages=362–396 |bibcode=1991NuPhB.360..362M }}</ref> Abelian anyons have been detected in connection to the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]]. The possible construction of anyonic Dirac matter relies on the symmetry protection of crossings of anyonic energy bands. In comparison to bosons and fermions the situation gets more complicated as translations in space do not necessarily commute. Additionally, for given spatial symmetries, the group structure describing the anyon strongly depends on the specific phase of the anyon interchange. For example, for bosons, a rotation of a particle about 2{{pi}} i.e., 360<math>^\\circ</math>, will not change its wave function. For fermions, a rotation of a particle about 2{{pi}}, will contribute a factor of <math>-1</math> to its wave function, whereas a 4{{pi}} rotation, i.e., a rotation about 720<math>^\\circ</math>, will give the same wave function as before. For anyons, an even higher degree of rotation can be necessary, e.g., 6{{pi}}, 8{{pi}}, etc., to leave the wave function invariant.

The term '''Dirac matter''' refers to a class of [[condensed matter]] systems which can be effectively described by the [[Dirac equation]]. Even though the [[Dirac equation]] itself was formulated for [[fermions]], the quasi-particles present within Dirac matter can be of any statistics. As a consequence, Dirac matter can be distinguished in [[fermionic]], [[bosonic]] or [[anyon]]ic Dirac matter. Prominent examples of Dirac matter are [[Graphene]], [[topological insulators]], Dirac semimetals, [[Weyl semimetal]]s, various [[high-temperature superconductors]] with <math>d</math>-wave pairing and [[Helium-3|liquid Helium-3]]. The effective theory of such systems is classified by a specific choice of the [[Dirac mass]], the Dirac velocity, the [[Dirac matrices]] and the [[space-time curvature]]. The universal treatment of the class of Dirac matter in terms of an effective theory leads to a common features with respect to the [[density of states]], the [[heat capacity]] and impurity scattering.

== Definition ==
Members of the class of Dirac matter differ significantly in nature. However, all examples of Dirac matter are unified by similarities within the algebraic structure of an effective theory describing them.

=== General ===

The general definition of Dirac matter is a condensed matter system where the [[quasi-particle]] excitations can be described in curved spacetime by the generalised Dirac equation:
:<math>
 \\left[i \\hbar v_D \\gamma^a e_a^\\mu d_\\mu(p) - m v_D^2\\right]\\Psi = 0.
</math>
In the above definition <math>d_\\mu</math> denotes a [[covariant vector]] depending on the <math>(d+1)</math>-dimensional momentum <math>p</math> (<math>d</math> space <math>+ 1</math> time dimension), <math>e_a^\\mu</math> is the [[vierbein]] describing the curvature of the space, <math>m</math> the [[quasi-particle]] mass and <math>v_D</math> the Dirac velocity. Note that since in Dirac matter the Dirac equation gives the effective theory of the quasiparticles, the energy from the mass term is <math>m v_D^2</math>, not the rest mass <math>m c^2</math> of a massive particle. <math>\\gamma^\\mu</math> refers to a set of [[Dirac matrices]], where the defining for the construction is given by the anticommutation relation,
:<math>
  \\left\\{\\gamma^\\mu,\\gamma^\\nu \\right\\} = \\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu + \\gamma^\\nu\\gamma^\\mu = \\eta^{\\mu\\nu} I_d.
</math>
<math>\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}</math> is the [[Minkowski metric]] with signature (+ - - -) and <math>I_d</math> is the <math>d\\times d</math>-dimensional unit matrix.
In all equations, implicit summation over <math>a</math> and <math>\\mu</math> is used ([[Einstein convention]]). Furthermore, <math>\\Psi</math> is the [[wavefunction]]. The unifying feature of all Dirac matter is the matrix structure of the equation describing the quasi-particle excitations.

In the limit where <math>d_\\mu(p) = D_\\mu</math>, i.e. the [[covariant derivative]], conventional Dirac matter is obtained. However, this general definition allows the description of matter with higher order dispersion relations and in curved spacetime as long as the effective [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] exhibits the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] structure specific to the [[Dirac equation]].

=== Common (conventional) ===

The majority of experimental realisations of Dirac matter to date are in the limit of <math>d_\\mu (p) = D_\\mu</math> which therefore defines conventional Dirac matter in which the quasiparticles are described by the [[Dirac equation in curved spacetime|Dirac equation in curved space-time]],
:<math>
 \\left[i \\hbar v_D \\gamma^a e_a^\\mu D_\\mu - m v_D^2\\right]\\Psi = 0.
</math>
Here, <math>D_\\mu</math> denotes the [[covariant derivative]]. As an example, for the flat metric, the energy of a free Dirac particle differs significantly from the classical kinetic energy where energy is proportional to momentum squared:
:<math>
\\begin{align}
\\mathrm{Free~Dirac~particle: \\;} E &= \\pm \\sqrt{\\hbar^2 v_D^2\\mathbf{k}^2+m^2c^4} \\\\
\\mathrm{Kinetic\\; energy: \\;} E &= \\frac{m |\\mathbf{v}|^2}{2} = \\frac{|\\mathbf{k}|^2}{2m}.
\\end{align}
</math>
The Dirac velocity <math>v_D</math> gives the gradient of the <math>E-k</math> dispersion at large momenta <math>k</math>, <math>m</math> is the mass of particle or object. In the case of massless Dirac matter, such as the fermionic quasiparticles in [[graphene]] or [[Weyl semimetal]]s, the energy-momentum relation is linear,
:<math>
 E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\hbar v_D |\\mathbf{k}|
</math>

Therefore, conventional Dirac matter includes all systems that have a linear crossing or linear behavior in some region of the energy-momentum relation. They are characterised by features that resemble an 'X', sometimes tilted or skewed and sometimes with a gap between the upper <math>\\vee</math> and lower <math>\\wedge</math> parts (the turning points of which become rounded if the origin of the gap is a mass term).

The general features and some specific examples of conventional Dirac matter are discussed in the following sections.

== General properties of Dirac matter ==

=== Technological relevance and tuning of Dirac matter ===

[[File:Tuning of Dirac matter.png|thumb|Tuning of Dirac matter: As the density of states is well defined, the density of states at the Fermi level (for fermionic Dirac matter) can be nicely tuned by shifting the chemical potential <math>\\mu</math>. Additionally, introducing a mass term <math>m</math> leads to a gap between the two cones and the dispersion becomes quadratic near <math>k=0</math>.]]

Dirac matter, especially fermionic Dirac matter has much potential for technological applications. For example, 2010's [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to [[Andre Geim]] and [[Konstantin Novoselov]] \"for groundbreaking experiments regarding the material graphene\". Within the official press release of the [[Swedish Royal Academy of Science]] it is stated that<ref name=\"nobelprize\">[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/press.pdf The Nobel Prize in Physics 2010]</ref>

In general, the properties of massless fermionic Dirac matter can be controlled by shifting the [[chemical potential]] by means of [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] or within a [[field effect (semiconductor)|field effect]] setup. By tuning the [[chemical potential]], it is possible to have a precise control of the number of states present, since the [[density of states]] varies in a well-defined way with energy.

Additionally, depending on the specific realization of the Dirac material, it may be possible to introduce a mass term <math>m</math> that opens a gap in the spectrum - a [[band gap]]. In general, the mass term is the result of breaking a specific symmetry of the system. The size of the [[band gap]] can be controlled precisely by controlling the strength of the mass term.

=== Density of states ===
The [[density of states]] of <math>d</math>-dimensional Dirac matter near the Dirac point scales as <math>N(\\epsilon)\\propto |\\epsilon|^{d-1}</math> where <math>\\epsilon</math> is the particle energy.<ref name=\"wehling2014dirac\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00018732.2014.927109|title=Dirac materials|journal=Advances in Physics|volume=63|issue=1|page=1|year=2014|last1=Wehling|first1=T.O|last2=Black-Schaffer|first2=A.M|last3=Balatsky|first3=A.V|arxiv=1405.5774}}</ref> The vanishing density of states for quasiparticles in Dirac matter mimics [[semimetal]] physics for physical dimension <math>d>1</math>. In the two-dimensional systems such as graphene and topological insulators, the density of states gives a V shape, compared with the constant value for massive particles with dispersion <math>E=k^2/2m</math>.

Experimental measurement of the density of states near the Dirac point by standard techniques such as scanning tunnelling microscopy often differ from the theoretical form due to the effects of disorder and interactions.<ref name=\"principi2011tunneling\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ssc.2012.04.040|title=The tunneling density-of-states of interacting massless Dirac fermions|journal=Solid State Communications|volume=152|issue=15|page=1456|year=2012|last1=Principi|first1=A|last2=Polini|first2=Marco|last3=Asgari|first3=Reza|last4=MacDonald|first4=A.H|arxiv=1111.3822|bibcode=2012SSCom.152.1456P}}</ref>

=== Specific heat ===
Specific heat, the [[heat capacity]] per unit mass, describes the energy required to change the temperature of a sample. The low-temperature electronic [[specific heat]] of Dirac matter is <math>C(T\\to 0)\\sim T^d</math> which is different from <math>C(T\\to 0)\\sim T</math> encountered for normal metals.<ref name=\"wehling2014dirac\"/> Therefore, for systems whose physical dimension is greater than 1, the specific heat can provide a clear signature of the underlying Dirac nature of the quasiparticles.

=== Landau quantization ===
[[Landau quantization]] refers to the quantization of the cyclotron orbits of charged particles in magnetic fields. As a result, the charged particles can only occupy orbits with discrete energy values, called Landau levels. For 2-dimensional systems with a perpendicular magnetic field, the energy for Landau-levels for ordinary matter described the Schrödinger equation and Dirac matter are given by<ref name=\"wehling2014dirac\"/>
:<math>
\\begin{align}
\\mathrm{Ordinary\\;matter: \\;} E &= \\hbar \\omega_c \\left(n+\\frac{1}{2} \\right), \\\\
\\mathrm{Dirac\\;Matter: \\;} E &= \\hbar \\omega_c \\sqrt{|n|}.
\\end{align}
</math>
Here, <math>\\omega_c</math> is the [[cyclotron frequency]] which is linearly dependent of the applied magnetic field and the charge of the particle. There are two distinct features between the Landau level quantization for 2D Schrödinger fermions (ordinary matter) and 2D Dirac fermions. First, the energy for Schrödinger fermions is linearly dependent with respect to the integer quantum number <math>n</math>, whereas it exhibits a square-root dependence for the Dirac fermions. This key difference plays an important role in the experimental verification of Dirac matter.<ref name=\"novoselov2005two\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04233|pmid=16281030|title=Two-dimensional gas of massless Dirac fermions in graphene|journal=Nature|volume=438|issue=7065|pages=197–200|year=2005|last1=Novoselov|first1=K.

== Fermionic Dirac matter ==
In the context of Fermionic quasiparticles, the Dirac velocity is identical to the Fermi velocity; in bosonic systems, no Fermi velocity exists, so the Dirac velocity is a more general property of such systems.

=== Graphene ===
[[Graphene]] is a 2-dimensional crystalline [[allotrope]] of [[carbon]], where the carbon atoms are arranged on a [[hexagonal lattice]].
Each carbon atom forms <math>\\sigma</math>-bonds to the three neighboring atoms that lie in the graphene plane at angles of 120<math>^\\circ</math>. These bonds are mediated by three of carbon's four [[electrons]] while the fourth electron, which occupies a <math>\\mathrm{p}_z</math> [[Atomic orbital|orbital]], mediates an out-of-plane [[pi-bond|{{pi}}-bond]] that leads to the [[Electronic band structure|electronic bands]] at the [[Fermi level]]. The unique transport properties and the [[semimetal]]lic state of graphene are the result of the delocalized electrons occupying these p<math>_z</math> orbitals.<ref name=\"abergel2010properties\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00018732.2010.487978|title=Properties of graphene: A theoretical perspective|journal=Advances in Physics|volume=59|issue=4|pages=261–482|year=2010|last1=Abergel|first1=D.S.L|last2=Apalkov|first2=V|last3=Berashevich|first3=J|last4=Ziegler|first4=K|last5=Chakraborty|first5=Tapash|arxiv=1003.0391}}</ref>

The semimetallic state corresponds to a linear crossing of energy bands at the <math>K</math> and <math>K'</math> points of graphene's hexagonal [[Brillouin zone]]. At these two points, the electronic structure can be effectively described by the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]
:<math>
{\\cal H} = \\hbar v_D \\left(\\tau k_x \\sigma_x + k_y \\sigma_y \\right). 
</math>
Here, <math>\\sigma_x</math> and <math>\\sigma_y</math> are two of the three [[Pauli matrices]].
The factor <math>\\tau=+/-</math> indicates whether the Hamiltonian describes is centred on the <math>K</math> or <math>K'</math> valley at the corner of hexagonal [[Brillouin zone]]. For graphene, the Dirac velocity is about <math>\\hbar v_D \\approx 5.8</math> eV <math>\\AA</math>.<ref name=\"abergel2010properties\"/> An energy gap in the dispersion of graphene can be obtained from a low-energy Hamiltionain of the form

\\begin{align}
{\\cal H} = \\hbar v_D (\\tau k_x \\sigma_x + k_y\\sigma_y) + M \\sigma_z,
\\end{align}

=== Topological insulators ===
A [[topological insulator]] is a material that behaves as an insulator in its interior (bulk) but whose surface contains conducting states. This property represents a non-trivial, symmetry protected [[topological order]]. As a consequence, electrons in topological insulators can only move along the [[Interface (matter)|surface]] of the material. In the bulk of a non-interacting topological insulator, the [[Fermi level]] is positioned within the gap between the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction and valence bands]]. On the surface, there are special states within the bulk [[energy gap]] which can be effectively described by a Dirac Hamiltonian: 
:<math>
\\begin{align}
{\\cal H} = \\hbar v_{D} (\\mathbf{k}\\times \\mathbf{\\sigma})\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}
\\end{align}

One distinct, experimentally observable feature of Weyl semimetals is that the surface states form [[Fermi arc]]s since the [[Fermi surface]] does not form a closed loop.

=== Dirac semimetals ===
In crystals that are symmetric under [[point reflection|inversion]] and [[T-symmetry|time reversal]], electronic energy bands are two-fold degenerate. This degeneracy is referred to as [[Kramers degeneracy]]. Therefore, semimetals with linear crossings of two energy bands (two-fold degeneracy) at the [[Fermi energy]] exhibit a four-fold degeneracy at the crossing point. The effective [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for these states can be written as 
:<math>
{\\cal H} = \\hbar v_D \\left(
\\begin{array}{cc}
 \\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma} & 0 \\\\
 0 & -\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}

\\right).

== Bosonic Dirac matter ==
[[File:Dispersions for bosonic (left) and fermionic (right) Dirac materials.png|thumb|Dispersions for bosonic (left) and fermionic (right) Dirac materials. In contrast to the fermionic case where Pauli exclusion confines excitations close to the Fermi energy, the description of boson requires the entire Brillioun zone.]]
While historic interest focussed on fermionic quasiparticles that have potential for technological applications, particularly in electronics, the mathematical structure of the [[Dirac equation]] is not restricted to the [[Particle statistics|statistics of the particles]]. This has led to recent development of the concept of bosonic Dirac matter.

In the case of [[bosons]], there is no [[Pauli exclusion principle]] to confine excitations close to the [[chemical potential]] (Fermi energy for fermions) so the entire [[Brillouin zone]] must be included. At low temperatures, the bosons will collect at the lowest energy point, the <math>\\Gamma</math>-point of the lower band. Energy must be added to excite the quasiparticles to the vicinity of the linear crossing point.

Several examples of Dirac matter with fermionic quasi-particles occur in systems where there is a hexagonal crystal lattice; so bosonic quasiparticles on an hexagonal lattice are the natural candidates for bosonic Dirac matter. In fact, the underlying symmetry of a crystal structure strongly constrains and protects the emergence of linear band crossings. Typical bosonic [[quasiparticles]] in [[condensed matter]] are [[magnon]]s, [[phonons]], [[polaritons]] and [[plasmons]].

Existing examples of bosonic Dirac matter include transition metal [[halides]] such as CrX<math>_3</math> (X= Cl, Br, I), where the [[magnon]] spectrum exhibits linear crossings,<ref name=\"pershoguba2018dirac\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.8.011010|title=Dirac Magnons in Honeycomb Ferromagnets|journal=Physical Review X|volume=8|issue=1|pages=011010|year=2018|last1=Pershoguba|first1=Sergey S|last2=Banerjee|first2=Saikat|last3=Lashley|first3=J. C|last4=Park|first4=Jihwey|last5=Ågren|first5=Hans|last6=Aeppli|first6=Gabriel|last7=Balatsky|first7=Alexander V|arxiv=1706.03384|bibcode=2018PhRvX...8a1010P}}</ref> granular [[superconductors]] in a [[honeycomb lattice]] <ref name=\"Banerjee\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.93.134502|title=Granular superconductor in a honeycomb lattice as a realization of bosonic Dirac material|journal=Physical Review B|volume=93|issue=13|pages=134502|year=2016|last1=Banerjee|first1=S|last2=Fransson|first2=J|last3=Black-Schaffer|first3=A.

== Anyonic Dirac materials ==
Anyonic Dirac matter is a hypothetical field which is rather unexplored to date. An [[anyon]] is a type of quasiparticle that can only occur in two-dimensional systems. Considering [[bosons]] and [[fermions]], the interchange of two particles contributes a factor of 1 or -1 to the wave function. In contrast, the operation of exchanging two identical anyons causes a global phase shift. Anyons are generally classified as ''abelian'' or ''non-abelian,'' according to whether the elementary excitations of the theory transform under an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[group representation|representation]] of the [[braid group]] or a non-abelian one.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(91)90407-O |url=http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~gmoore/MooreReadNonabelions.pdf |title=Nonabelions in the fractional quantum hall effect |date=19 Aug 1991 |last1=Moore |first1=Gregory |authorlink1=Greg Moore (physicist) |last2=Read |first2=Nicholas |authorlink2=Nicholas Read |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=360 |issue=2–3 |pages=362–396 |bibcode=1991NuPhB.360..362M }}</ref> Abelian anyons have been detected in connection to the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]]. The possible construction of anyonic Dirac matter relies on the symmetry protection of crossings of anyonic energy bands. In comparison to bosons and fermions the situation gets more complicated as translations in space do not necessarily commute. Additionally, for given spatial symmetries, the group structure describing the anyon strongly depends on the specific phase of the anyon interchange. For example, for bosons, a rotation of a particle about 2{{pi}} i.e., 360<math>^\\circ</math>, will not change its wave function. For fermions, a rotation of a particle about 2{{pi}}, will contribute a factor of <math>-1</math> to its wave function, whereas a 4{{pi}} rotation, i.e., a rotation about 720<math>^\\circ</math>, will give the same wave function as before. For anyons, an even higher degree of rotation can be necessary, e.g., 6{{pi}}, 8{{pi}}, etc., to leave the wave function invariant.

'''Mary-Belle Kirschner''' (born 23 October 1999), better known by her online alias '''Belle Delphine''', is an English [[Internet personality]], model, and [[YouTuber]]. She is most notable for her [[glamour photography|glamour]] and [[cosplay]] [[Instagram model|modeling]] on [[Instagram]]. Her posts on the platform featured a risqué and self-proclaimed \"weird\" aesthetic, and were often influenced by popular [[Internet memes]] and trends. As a result of her online activity, she became an Internet meme in her own right.

In the summer of 2019, Kirschner registered a joke [[Pornhub]] account and began selling her \"GamerGirl Bath Water\" product through her online store, garnering her a great amount of media coverage online. Shortly after, her Instagram account was deleted due to community guideline violations. Media outlets have described Kirschner as a cross between an [[Internet troll]] and a performance artist, as well as an [[e-girls and e-boys|e-girl]]. Kirschner has also been cited as an influence on the e-girl aesthetic commonly adopted by [[TikTok]] users.

==Life and career==
===Early years and developing an aesthetic===
Kirschner was born on 23 October 1999 in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], and eventually moved to the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=Sloan2019>{{cite web|last=Sloan|first=Elizabeth|url=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2019/07/belle-delphine/|title=Belle Delphine: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|work=[[Heavy.com|Heavy]]|date=19 July 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720020343/https://heavy.com/entertainment/2019/07/belle-delphine/|archive-date=20 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=PopBuzz2019>{{cite web|url=https://www.popbuzz.com/internet/youtubers/belle-delphine/real-name/|title=Belle Delphine: 12 Facts You (Probably) Didn't Know About The Online Star|work=[[Global (company)#Digital-only stations|PopBuzz]]|publisher=[[Global (company)|Global]]|date=2019|accessdate=31 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831210349/https://www.popbuzz.com/internet/youtubers/belle-delphine/real-name/|archive-date=31 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Aggeler2019>{{cite web|last=Aggeler|first=Madeleine|url=https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/belle-delphine-bath-water.html|title=Who Is Belle Delphine, the Gamer Girl Selling Her Bathwater?|work=[[The Cut (blog)|The Cut]]|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=19 July 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713005639/https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/belle-delphine-bath-water.html|archive-date=13 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Kirschner has had an Instagram account since 2015,<ref name=Leskin2019-a>{{cite web|last=Leskin|first=Paige|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/belle-delphine-instagram-bathwater-pornhub-2019-7|title=Meet Belle Delphine, the Instagram star who sold her bathwater to 'thirsty gamer boys' and had her account shut down over a rules violation|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=10 September 2019|accessdate=7 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191008235928/https://www.businessinsider.com/belle-delphine-instagram-bathwater-pornhub-2019-7/|archive-date=8 October 2019|url-status=live}}

Her selling of GamerGirl Bath Water was met with considerable controversy, media coverage, and [[Internet memes]].<ref name=Dodgson2019b/><ref name=Vivar2019>{{cite web|last=Vivar|first=Maia|url=https://www.ibtimes.com/belle-delphines-bathwater-causes-backlash-pathetic-2805679|title=Belle Delphine's Bathwater Causes Backlash: 'Pathetic'|work=[[International Business Times]]|date=10 July 2019|accessdate=21 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721042116/https://www.ibtimes.com/belle-delphines-bathwater-causes-backlash-pathetic-2805679|archive-date=21 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The response from general Internet users also included tangential hoaxes based around the bath water, as well as parody and knock-off products.

EJ Dickson of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that the response from media outlets alternated between \"deriding [Kirschner's] fans for their naïvete and applauding her for her marketing savvy.\"<ref name=Dickson2019/> Katie Bishop, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', reported that the sale was \"widely mocked.\"<ref name=Bishop2019/> In concurrence, the ''[[International Business Times]]'' wrote, \"while some people were amused by the idea of buying someone's bathwater, others have said that anyone who bought the GamerGirl Bath Water was 'sad' and 'pathetic.'\"<ref name=Vivar2019/> Patricia Hernandez of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' commented, \"Perhaps this seems like a strange thing to do, but it's very similar to the phenomenon of sex workers selling intimate items, such as panties.\" Hernandez additionally opined, \"What's curious about [Kirschner's] side hustle here is that it seems to be a mixture of business and next-level performance art. In the video advertising the bath water, she outright calls this a stunt. And if you look at her wider Instagram oeuvre, [Kirschner's] work is defined by her willingness to ''go there''. The result is as strange as it is funny.\"<ref name=Hernandez2019/>

In a July 2019 interview with ''The Guardian'', Kirschner stated, \"I'm lucky. I can do crazy things and get to see the world react to it, and there's definitely enjoyment in that, even if it's sometimes a little scary. I get a bigger reaction to my weirder content but I think that's only possible because I also make risqué content.\"<ref name=Bishop2019>{{cite web|last=Bishop|first=Katie|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/12/belle-delphine-gamer-girl-instagram-selling-bath-wate|title=Who is paying $30 for 'gamer girl' Belle Delphine's bath water?|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 July 2019|accessdate=21 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721035925/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/12/belle-delphine-gamer-girl-instagram-selling-bath-wate|archive-date=21 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> She added, \"I think it's been amazing and fun, but it's time to move on to new things.

==Media reception==
Kirschner's Belle Delphine persona and her related content has garnered much curiosity and scrutiny from online users and media outlets alike. Various outlets, including ''[[New York (magazine)|The Cut]]'', ''[[Business Insider]]'', ''[[Kotaku]]'', and ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' have described her as a \"troll\", and several instances of her activity online as \"stunts\".<ref name=Aggeler2019/><ref name=Leskin2019-a/><ref name=Hernandez2019/><ref name=Rivera2019/> Many of those outlets also assert that there is a satirical and ironic layer to her content; Bishop wrote that Kirschner \"has successfully tapped into an online subculture by creating content that exists somewhere between Internet pranks and erotic modeling. For many of her followers, Delphine is a personality before she is a pornographic model.\"<ref name=Bishop2019/> Kirschner's polarizing social media presence has also been noted, with ''[[Evening Standard|London Evening Standard]]'' writing that she \"has sparked a flurry of debate online, with fans branding her everything from a master manipulator to a harmful sexist stereotype of gamer girls.\"<ref name=Hills2019>{{cite web|last=Hills|first=Megan C.|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/insider/alist/who-is-belle-delphine-from-selling-her-bath-water-to-being-arrested-over-a-hamster-theft-heres-what-a4257911.html|title=Who is Belle Delphine?

<blockquote>It is not a huge stretch to assert that [Kirschner], who has built up a body of work that can be read as satirical, might be in the midst of some sort of long-term joke here, especially given her long list of stunts that all tend to subvert or toy with well-established fetish tropes. Even the notion of 'gamer girl bath water' plays with all manner of stereotypes about women in games and how some men see them: as mythical unicorns to lust after.<ref name=Rivera2019/></blockquote>

Lela London, writing for ''[[The Telegraph (website)|The Telegraph]]'', opined that \"for women to truly escape gaming's gendered grip, we need to raise more non-fetishized Gamer Girls to the top. [Kirschner] is proof there is still quite a way to go.\"<ref name=London2019>{{cite web|last=London|first=Lela|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/belle-delphine-proof-gaming-culture-cant-escape-hyper-sexualised/|title=Is Belle Delphine proof gaming culture can't escape its hyper-sexualised past?|work=[[The Telegraph (website)|The Telegraph]]|date=19 July 2019|accessdate=21 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720180806/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/belle-delphine-proof-gaming-culture-cant-escape-hyper-sexualised/|archive-date=20 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Aoife Wilson, Head of Video at ''[[Eurogamer]]'' has conversely commented positively on Kirschner's online persona and content, asserting that \"[Kirschner] is an incredibly savvy businesswoman. She gained a huge online following through her love of cosplay and her ability to replicate real-life ''ahegao'' faces. She's kept that momentum going by engaging with her followers and trying new things, always skirting the line between sexy and surreal. She absolutely knows her audience.\"<ref name=London2019/>

Her content's connection with themes found in Japanese culture and media has also been examined. Dickson wrote that the references to Japanese culture in Kirschner's content have garnered her some criticism, as she has been \"accused of racism and [[cultural appropriation]] in her cosplay, as well as capitalizing on the eroticization of young girls.\"<ref name=Dickson2019/> Conversely, Japanese adult performer [[Marica Hase]] opined \"I see her manga characters as more of an homage and not racist.\"<ref name=Dickson2019/>

On why Kirschner attracts much controversy, Dickson wrote that:

<blockquote>Delphine markets herself as a 'gamer girl', which engages with a very specific stereotype about women in gaming. In the gaming community, there's a longstanding perception of female gamers as desperate attention-seekers who sexualize themselves to get more views and capitalize on horny dudes' desire for nerdy female counterparts.<ref name=Dickson2019/></blockquote>

'''Mary-Belle Kirschner''' (born 23 October 1999), better known by her online alias '''Belle Delphine''', is an English [[Internet personality]], model, and [[YouTuber]]. She is most notable for her [[glamour photography|glamour]] and [[cosplay]] [[Instagram model|modeling]] on [[Instagram]]. Her posts on the platform featured a risqué and self-proclaimed \"weird\" aesthetic, and were often influenced by popular [[Internet memes]] and trends. As a result of her online activity, she became an Internet meme in her own right.

In the summer of 2019, Kirschner registered a joke [[Pornhub]] account and began selling her \"GamerGirl Bath Water\" product through her online store, garnering her a great amount of media coverage online. Shortly after, her Instagram account was deleted due to community guideline violations. Media outlets have described Kirschner as a cross between an [[Internet troll]] and a performance artist, as well as an [[e-girls and e-boys|e-girl]]. Kirschner has also been cited as an influence on the e-girl aesthetic commonly adopted by [[TikTok]] users.

==Life and career==

Her selling of GamerGirl Bath Water was met with considerable controversy, media coverage, and [[Internet memes]].<ref name=Dodgson2019b/><ref name=Vivar2019>{{cite web|last=Vivar|first=Maia|url=https://www.ibtimes.com/belle-delphines-bathwater-causes-backlash-pathetic-2805679|title=Belle Delphine's Bathwater Causes Backlash: 'Pathetic'|work=[[International Business Times]]|date=10 July 2019|accessdate=21 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721042116/https://www.ibtimes.com/belle-delphines-bathwater-causes-backlash-pathetic-2805679|archive-date=21 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The response from general Internet users also included tangential hoaxes based around the bath water, as well as parody and knock-off products.

EJ Dickson of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that the response from media outlets alternated between \"deriding [Kirschner's] fans for their naïvete and applauding her for her marketing savvy.\"<ref name=Dickson2019/> Katie Bishop, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', reported that the sale was \"widely mocked.\"<ref name=Bishop2019/> In concurrence, the ''[[International Business Times]]'' wrote, \"while some people were amused by the idea of buying someone's bathwater, others have said that anyone who bought the GamerGirl Bath Water was 'sad' and 'pathetic.'\"<ref name=Vivar2019/> Patricia Hernandez of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' commented, \"Perhaps this seems like a strange thing to do, but it's very similar to the phenomenon of sex workers selling intimate items, such as panties.\" Hernandez additionally opined, \"What's curious about [Kirschner's] side hustle here is that it seems to be a mixture of business and next-level performance art.

The result is as strange as it is funny.\"<ref name=Hernandez2019/>

In a July 2019 interview with ''The Guardian'', Kirschner stated, \"I'm lucky. I can do crazy things and get to see the world react to it, and there's definitely enjoyment in that, even if it's sometimes a little scary.

A glimpse into the subculture of e-girls and e-boys, the teen gamers who are the radical antithesis of the Instagram influencer [2 October 2019 archive]|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=1 October 2019|accessdate=23 March 2020|archive-date=2 October 2019}}</ref> and Delphine has been cited by several media outlets as helping influence the e-girl aesthetic commonly found on [[TikTok]].<ref name=Leskin2019-b/><ref name=Grayson2020>{{cite web|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|url=https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2020/03/06/down-the-rabbit-hole-of-twitch-streamers-tiktoks|title=Down the Rabbit Hole of Twitch Streamers' TikToks|work=[[Kotaku|Kotaku UK]]|date=6 March 2020|accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref> ''Rolling Stones''{{'}}s EJ Dickson described Kirschner's posts as being more \"bizarre\" and \"ridiculous\", rather than \"overtly sexual\", and opined that: \"Such content appears to indicate that Delphine is leaning into — if not overtly parodying — the perception of the ideal girl as a hot, innocent young thing whose desire to play ''[[Fortnite]]'' is only eclipsed by her desire for nerdy gamer boy dick.\"<ref name=Dickson2019/> After her GamerGirl Bath Water product went viral on the Internet, ''[[Kotaku]]'' opined that:

<blockquote>It is not a huge stretch to assert that [Kirschner], who has built up a body of work that can be read as satirical, might be in the midst of some sort of long-term joke here, especially given her long list of stunts that all tend to subvert or toy with well-established fetish tropes. Even the notion of 'gamer girl bath water' plays with all manner of stereotypes about women in games and how some men see them: as mythical unicorns to lust after.<ref name=Rivera2019/></blockquote>

Lela London, writing for ''[[The Telegraph (website)|The Telegraph]]'', opined that \"for women to truly escape gaming's gendered grip, we need to raise more non-fetishized Gamer Girls to the top. [Kirschner] is proof there is still quite a way to go.\"<ref name=London2019>{{cite web|last=London|first=Lela|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/belle-delphine-proof-gaming-culture-cant-escape-hyper-sexualised/|title=Is Belle Delphine proof gaming culture can't escape its hyper-sexualised past?|work=[[The Telegraph (website)|The Telegraph]]|date=19 July 2019|accessdate=21 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720180806/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/belle-delphine-proof-gaming-culture-cant-escape-hyper-sexualised/|archive-date=20 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Aoife Wilson, Head of Video at ''[[Eurogamer]]'' has conversely commented positively on Kirschner's online persona and content, asserting that \"[Kirschner] is an incredibly savvy businesswoman. She gained a huge online following through her love of cosplay and her ability to replicate real-life ''ahegao'' faces. She's kept that momentum going by engaging with her followers and trying new things, always skirting the line between sexy and surreal. She absolutely knows her audience.\"<ref name=London2019/>

Her content's connection with themes found in Japanese culture and media has also been examined. Dickson wrote that the references to Japanese culture in Kirschner's content have garnered her some criticism, as she has been \"accused of racism and [[cultural appropriation]] in her cosplay, as well as capitalizing on the eroticization of young girls.\"<ref name=Dickson2019/> Conversely, Japanese adult performer [[Marica Hase]] opined \"I see her manga characters as more of an homage and not racist.\"<ref name=Dickson2019/>

On why Kirschner attracts much controversy, Dickson wrote that:

<blockquote>Delphine markets herself as a 'gamer girl', which engages with a very specific stereotype about women in gaming. In the gaming community, there's a longstanding perception of female gamers as desperate attention-seekers who sexualize themselves to get more views and capitalize on horny dudes' desire for nerdy female counterparts.<ref name=Dickson2019/></blockquote>

'''Katherine Stewart MacPhail''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (30 October 1887 - 11 September 1974) was a Scottish surgeon. During [[World War I]], she served as Chief Medical Officer of two units of the [[Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service]]. She cared for the wounded in Serbia, France, and the [[Macedonian front|Thessaloniki Front]]. In 1921, during her stay in Serbia, she founded the country's first children's hospital.<ref name=\"bl.uk2016\">{{cite web |last1=Kerziouk |first1=Olga |title=Serbia celebrates British heroines of the First World War |url=https://blogs.bl.uk/european/2016/02/serbia-celebrates-british-heroines-of-the-first-world-war.html |publisher=British Library |accessdate=16 January 2019 |date=14 February 2016}}</ref> While she is remembered as a national hero in Serbia,<ref name=\"bbc.com\">{{cite news |title=Serbian stamps honour WW1 heroines |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-35039265 |accessdate=12 January 2019 |work=BBC News |date=8 December 2015}}</ref> she was criticized by some for providing her expertise in Serbia rather than in her own country.{{sfn|Oldfield|2001|p=148}} Her honors include several medals, plaques, and a postage stamp.

==Early years and education==
Katherine Stewart MacPhail was born in [[Glasgow]] on 30 October 1887, the third of four daughters of Jesse PacPhail and Dr Donald MacPhail, a doctor.{{sfn|The World's Children|1975|p=n.p.}} MacPhail was the only daughter in the family who showed an interest in her father's work. As a young girl, she entered the father's office and watched him examine the patients or treat wounds; she also went with him to visit patients on remote farms. In addition, her decision to dedicate her life to medicine was probably influenced by her uncles who were successful doctors: James led the missionary hospital in India, and Alex was a professor of anatomy at the University of Glasgow.

MacPhail and her siblings' were initially home schooled by private teachers. Once they were old enough they attended the distant elementary school in [[Coatbridge]], going on to study at Hillhead Academy in [[Glasgow]]. All four children successfully completing their studies at the Academy, and later at the [[University of Glasgow]].
[[File:Др Кетрин Макфејл портрет.jpg|thumb|Graduation, 1905]]
At that time in Scotland, it was unusual for women to study at all, and especially medicine. Of the well-educated womeny from reputable families, they expected only to lead the household well and deal with art. Probably for this reason, her father was against his MacPhail's desire to study medicine. However, she had already demonstrated decisive determination and persistence, and he could not stand in the way of her decision. Her parents understood the importance of education, and on 26 April 1906 she enrolled to study medicine at the [[University of Glasgow]]. She was an excellent student, ane received numerous awards for her studies. She graduated on 12 October 1911 with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MB ChB]] from [[University of Glasgow Medical School]].{{sfn|Haines|Stevens|2001|p=192}}<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\">{{cite web |title=Surgeon Katherine S Macphail |url=https://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/ww1-biography/?id=4499 |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>

MacPhail began her medical career at the [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]] in Glasgow, and she was also an assistant doctor at her father's clinic.

==World War I==
===Scotland, 1914===
When [[World War I]] broke out, MacPhail decided to volunteer for active service in the [[British Army]] and sent a letter to the Ministry of War requesting to do so. The answer was fast, declining her request and explaining that the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] did not accept women. She turned to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], and received a similar response, as it too did not accept female doctors. She contacted [[Elsie Inglis|Dr Elsie Inglis]], who was recruiting women doctors and other medical staff for a women's volunteer medical units. Dr Inglis offered her hospital team to the British Ministry of War, but was rejected by the sentence: \"My dear lady, go home and sit still.\" Dr Inglis then sent letters to the embassies of France, Belgium, Russia and Serbia, who accepted this offer immediately and with gratitude. 
{{Quote box

From then, she began active work for the [[Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service]] which affiliated itself with the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffrage movement]]. As the units for France and Belgium had already been filled, MacPhail was in a dilemma whether to go to Serbia, which was little known in the United Kingdom at that time. MacPhail later said: \"I really hardly knew where Serbia was, but from what I read, I knew it was very difficult for them.\" MacPhail accepted the offer and joined as the youngest in a group of 30 women who comprised the staff of the first unit of the Scottish Women's Hospital in Serbia. Her sister Isabel accompanied her to function as an [[orderly]].<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />

===Serbia, 1915===
In mid-December 1914, MacPhail's group boarded a transport boat in Southampton. On the way to [[Malta]],{{sfn|Dositey Obradovich Circle|2009|p=116}} most members of the unit spent time learning Serbian. Immediately after Christmas, they boarded the ship \"Nile\", which sailed to [[Piraeus]]. They arrived in [[Thessaloniki]] on 1 January 1915, and the next day boarded a train for [[Kragujevac]], which was the headquarters of the Serbian army and military medical team. Though she was a junior doctor, she felt her skills were not being used appropriately.{{sfn|Sharp|Stibbe|2011|p=410}}<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />

In the year 1915, an epidemic of [[typhoid fever]] emerged among the Serbian army. In June 1915, when the epidemic was in decline, MacPhail became seriously ill with a severe form of the infection. Her hearing was damaged long-lasting high temperatures, and she lost her hair, so covered wore a hat or a scarf for a long time. When she was healed, on the insistence of [[Ernest Troubridge|Admiral Ernest Troubridge]], she left Serbia and returned to Scotland in order to recover completely. She reached Scotland in September 1915.

===France, 1916===
As soon as she had recovered sufficiently, MacPhail contacted the Serbian Support Fund in [[London]] and began a campaign to help the organization. She traveled all over Scotland, attended charity meetings and held lectures about her experiences in Serbia, appealing for help for the country.

As she was unable to return to Serbia, which at the time was behind enemy lines, in January 1916, she joined the charity \"Friends\", which worked in France. She worked at Shalona in Marni, in the [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne region]], northeast of [[Paris]]. In April 1916, she was offered a job in [[Corsica]], and in May 1916, arrived in [[Bastia]] to work at a hospital. A few days after her arrival she went to [[Ajaccio]], visiting a Scottish Women's Hospital. There, she met with several acquaintances she knew from Serbia, and they told her what was happening to their old unit. Finding that there were opportunities to return to Serbia, she interrupted her stay in Corsica, in order to try to organize the accommodation of Serbian orphans in the \"Friends\" home in the High Savai. Unfortunately, this failed. \"Friends\" took over a hotel in Samoan, about {{convert|20|km}} from the Swiss border, and turned it into a refugee camp. At the end of September 1916, MacPhail took over the duties of a doctor in this home. During her stay in France, Dr. Sondermayer, chief of the Sanitary Department of the Serbian Army, offered her a place in a hospital and MacPhail, immediately accepted the offer.{{sfn|American National Red Cross|1916|p=418}}

===Serbia, 1917===
[[File:На Солунском фронту 1917. године .jpg|thumb|left|MacPhail (sitting in the car) with colleagues, 1917.]]
[[File:Играње кола на Солунском фронту.jpg|thumb|Dancing the kolo with an Allied and a Serbian officer, amidst one of the regiments on the Thessaloniki front, ca. 1917–18.]]
In the early spring of 1917, MacPhail was on the [[Macedonian front|Thessaloniki front]]. In Thessaloniki, MacPhail located her younger sister, Isabel, who arrived there earlier with the Scottish Women's Hospital. Dr Sondermayer offered MacPhail and Isabel an opportunity to work in a newly formed large hospital, which France provided to the Serbian army, named the Serbian Hospital of Crown Prince [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]].

A few days later, they received an invitation from the head of the Serbian Relielf Fund in [[Thessaloniki]] to come to their hospital in Sorović (today the Greek town of [[Amyntaio]], near the Greek-Macedonian border) to help care for the injured civilian population during the bombing of [[Bitola#World War I|Bitola]] and the surrounding area. MacPhail and Isabel as well as two other nurses and a cook were sent to the village of Brod, on the south-eastern side of the Bitola area. Isabel soon left Brod and returned to Thessaloniki to work in the Serbian hospital of Crown Prince Alexander, while MacPhail remained behind. At the end of the year, she traveled to Thessaloniki, returning to Brod with a serious illness. She was sure that it was a disease that was caused by long-term poor nutrition, and later it was identified as [[pellagra]], then a little-known disease caused by a diet insufficient in vitamins.

At the end of 1917, the hospital of the Serbian Support Fund was moved from Sorović to [[Germijan]] near Brod, where MacPhail's outpatient clinic was closed to this village. At the same time, she approached her deadline to report to her post at the Serbian Hospital of Crown Prince Alexander in Thessaloniki. MacPhail was firmly convinced that her medical help was far more needed in the villages, so she managed to persuade Dr Sondermayer to let her remain in Bitola. At that time, MacPhail was visited by her friend, Dr Edward W. Ryan, whom she showed the poor living conditions in the nearby villages. Seeing this, Ryan immediately began collecting aid through the [[American Red Cross]], and managed to obtain a mobile outpatient unit, which was supplied with drugs and food supplies so that MacPhail could expand her work to improving the nutrition of vulnerable children.

During the winter of 1917/18, MacPhail was invited to a celebration where she first saw and met Crown Prince Alexander. In the Macedonian mountains, conditions were harsh and cold, but MacPhail with her mobile outpatient unit visited the surrounding villages regularly and did her job. In the meantime, her family and friends in Scotland collected warm clothes and footwear which Katherine shared with impoverished women and children.

===Scotland, 1918===
In the summer of 1918, MacPahil returned to Scotland for a short time to assist her father, Dr Donald MacPhail, who was working alone attending to patients who had contracted [[Spanish flu]]. When he contracted the flu, MacPhail and Isabel left,{{sfn|Miller|2018|p=233}} and the responsible parties accepted their reasons. MacPhail was distinguished by the [[Order of St. Sava]] IV class and the Medal of the Serbian Red Cross,<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" /> while Isabel received the Cross of Mercy. In August 1918, the sisters MacPhail left Thessaloniki and returned to their native Scotland.
[[File:Диплома .jpg|thumb|Certificate naming MacPhail as an honorary citizen of Coatbridge, 15 August 1918]]
In Scotland, MacPhail cared for her sick father and some of his patients. On 15 August 1918 MacPhail became an honorary citizen of Coatbridge, and at a special ceremony received the town's charter, and a gold watch.

MacPhail followed news of the offensives on the Tessaloniki front and the allies breakthrough in September 1918.

==Interwar period==
=== Return to Serbia===
At the end of November 1918 MacPhail returned to Serbia. Clothing, footwear and other supplies to help Serbia, were collected by her family, friends and patients, were packaged and sent separately via the Red Cross. From [[London]], MacPhail traveled to [[Paris]] and [[Toulon]] where she waited to board a ship to [[Dubrovnik]]. At that time Tulon was then crowded with refugees from Serbia, soldiers and civilians trying to return home. In Toulon she met Darinka Grujic, who had been taking care of Serbian orphans and refugees in France since the beginning of the war, which she wanted to return to Serbia. After several days waiting in Toulon, she embarked for Dubrovnik,then traveled for 3 days to Sarajevo, [[Zemun]] and finally Belgrade.

After her arrival in Belgrade MacPhail applied to the Ministry of the Interior and was granted permission to stay to carryout charity work.

====First Children's Hospital in Belgrade====
At the beginning of 1919, she opened the first children's hospital in Belgrade. This was facilitated by Darinka Grujic securing five military barracks in Studenicka Street, near the Military Hospital, and giving one of the barracks to MacPhail to establish a children's hospital. British marines, led by Admiral Troubridge, cleaned, repaired and outfitted the barrack. A steriliser was installed along with 25 military beds, bedding, blankets and other supplies from Red Cross. Drugs and military supplies came from the American Red Cross. The Serbian Support Fund opened a charity kitchen for a nearby school, so MacPhail managed to arrange to supply this kitchen with food as well as for children at the hospital, while firewood was provided by the city government. Troubridge received many toys and Florence Harvey offered to provide a car for free. At the end of January 1919, the hospital received its first patients.

During the first months of operation, every bed in the hospital was filled, and a large number of children attended the outpatient clinic. MacPhail performed all the medical work because there were few doctors as only about 100 had survived the war. Because of her work, MacPhail was popular in Belgrade, and was able to provide various types of assistance and donations for those who lacked financial means.

====Pavilion in Topčider====
[[File:Пацијенти у Топчидерском павиљону.jpg|thumb|Patients at Topčider Pavilion]]
By spring of 1919, the hospital was already too small in particular due to an increase in the number of children with [[tuberculosis]]. MacPhail learned that there was an empty and abandoned open pavilion that was previously used for children at [[Topčider]], {{convert|10|km}} from Belgrade/ The pavilion was located on a hill, at the edge of a forest, so it was ideal for a treatment consisting of fresh air and sun, which, in addition to good food and rest, was at that time the only medicine for tuberculosis. MacPhail was granted a permit from the city government to arrange necessary repairs for the building and to procure equipment. By Easter 1919 the 40 bed pavilion received its first patients. It was managed by Mary Baker and soon proved to be successful with many children recovering. As an open pavilion it was only used in the summer months. It closed in 1924.

====Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital====
[[File:Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital surgical ward.png|thumb|Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital surgical ward]]
As the work expanded, MacPhail realized that the existing capacities would soon be insufficient for an increasing number of patients, especially because the top of the pavilion made it unusable in the winter, so she began to think about expanding the hospital. An enlarged building in Kneza Milosa Street, near the Military Hospital, was left empty when British marines left Belgrade and MacPhail immediately started the action to get that house for her hospital. It was a large, bright, well-built and preserved building that had enough space to accommodate 50 beds, especially when MacPhail succeeded in replacing large military beds for children's beds. In addition, a small operating room for easy surgical cases was formed, while severe surgical cases were sent to the state hospital. A large department for outpatient patients was also established. This new hospital began operating in November 1919, though it officially opened in February 1921. It was no longer an improvised institution, but a real medical institution. It was officially recognized by the Government of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as the first Children's Hospital in Serbia, called the Anglo-Serb Children's Hospital, abbreviated ASCH. It was the only children's hospital in what was now [[Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Oldfield|2001|p=149}} Shortly after the opening of this hospital, the Ministry of Health asked MacPhail to receive infants and newborns, so a special nursing department was also set up with treatment provided by the most experienced nurse. By 1921, MacPhail was hopeful to not only perfect this hospital, but to encourage the foundation of others and to train native nurses to work in them.{{sfn|The Hospital|1921|p=5}}

===Dubrovnik===
[[File:Ени Макфејл.jpg|thumb|MacPhail (left) and her colleague preparing food on the terrace \"Villa Bravačić\" in Dubrovnik, ca. 1920-1921]]
As the number of patients at Topcider had been steadily increasing, MacPhail came to the idea of finding a place on the seashore where she could accommodate children with tuberculous. She learned that there is a villa in [[Dubrovnik]] that would be ideal for this purpose. MacPhail contacted [[Zivojin Mišić]] who was then the head of the generalštab and whom MacPhail knew from the Thessaloniki front. When MacPhail explained to him that this villa in Dubrovnik should serve as a health center and a children's rest home, he immediately ordered the villa to be handed over to the English-Serbian children's hospital for further use. MacPhail's sister, Isabel, who was already doing volunteer work at the Children's Hospital in Belgrade, traveled to Dubrovnik to see the building and to try and find the equipment for her. While she was in Dubrovnik, Isabel heard of an abandoned Austrian hospital near [[Zelenika]] in [[Bay of Kotor|Boka Kotorska]] and traveled there to see what it was about. To her surprise, she found a deserted but fully equipped hospital, with beds, bedding and other material, and a young Serbian officer who kept all of this with his soldiers. It was Vasa Srdi. He offered for Isabel to take everything she needed, and in addition, he immediately arranged shipping and transport of equipment to Dubrovnik. Isabel chose 60 beds together and other equipment and returned to Dubrovnik. As the building itself was well preserved, the hospital was established in February 1920.

===Sremska Kamenica===
In the early 1930s, a report was submitted regarding the Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital stating that during the preceding two years, 115 hospital patients were hospitalized (hospitalization of some patients lasted up to 24 months), and 160 children were treated clinically, or outside the hospital. There were also 25 surgical procedures, 194 punctures and 113 X-ray imaging, and 84 immunizations with gypsum were performed. Fifty children left the hospital as successfully cured, 12 of them had improved health status during discharge, and the rest was on further treatment. The conclusion was that in spite of the small number of beds and a limited fund owned by the Anglo-Yugoslav hospital, she managed to fulfill all the tasks. The enormous costs of maintaining a hospital in Belgrade had become increasingly high year after year, and this, among other reasons, influenced MacPhail to start thinking about moving the hospital somewhere in the interior of the country, but not too far from Belgrade, which would be in open air with fresh air and sun. She even thought about buying one of the abandoned [[Fruška Gora]] monasteries. Darinka Grujic advised her to try to find a suitable building or to build a new building in [[Sremska Kamenica]], which according to its natural conditions, was the most suitable place for this purpose. As MacPhail already had a holiday home in Sremska Kamenica, she immediately started making plans for the establishment of a new hospital.

MacPhail's old friend, Eng. Vasa Srdić had been an officer of the Serbian army in Zelenika in the early 1920s He had helped Isabel and subsequently became a great friend of the sisters MacPhail. After the war, as a graduate engineer of agronomy, he got land in [[Temerin]], where he settled and was engaged in farming and fruit growing. Being aware of MacPhail's plans, he soon learned that on the hill Čardak, just above Sremska Kamenica, an old and abandoned vineyard was being sold which could suit MacPhail's plans. She was thrilled with the position of the city itself and its surroundings and bought the land, which was officially conveyed to her on August 1, 1933, and immediately began preparations for the construction of the hospital. According to Ketrin's idea and with the help of an engineer of the Hygienic Institute in Belgrade, an old Russian architect made plans for a three-winged building with a central courtyard and a long terrace along the north and west wing so that children can be in the sun all day.

In the spring of 1934, the work on the new hospital was completed, all necessary equipment was ordered, and lists of patients scheduled to start treatment were compiled. The Royal Commission of the Danube Banovina approved the opening of the children's sanatorium. The building consisted of a main frontal area and two symmetrically situated wings. The main part consisted of three departments of the hospital, a patient unit, a workshop, a radiotherapy department, a pharmacy section, a space intended for patients with infectious diseases and rooms for the sterilization of instruments and appliances. Also, there was an area for the administration of the hospital, as well as a warehouse for medicines and instruments. In the wings of the buildingm there was a kitchen with a pantry and a dining room for children. On the first floor were four-room dormitories for doctors and nurses. There were also four bathrooms and toilets arranged in the wings of the building. The hospital was built in accordance with the needs of patients who anticipated a longer stay for treatment. There were terraces in front of the south and west wings. Even the courtyard was fenced and decorated like a park. The orchard and vineyard were also located within the yard.

The principle treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis at the time when antibiotics and antituberculotics did not exist consisted of increasing the general resistance of patients with hygienic and dietary regimen, fresh air therapy, heliotherapy (exposure to the sun during the day, during the winter exposure to artificial light), immobilization and various surgical procedures. Special attention was also paid to hospital hygiene. School-age children attended daily classes that corresponded to their age and curriculum, after which they would receive a certificate at the end of the school year. The hospital also organized workshops that were part of the work therapy, where children attended art classes. Once a week, the Orthodox priest would come to provide the children with religious instruction. The hospital also had a library that was equipped with a large number of children's books, which were both educational and entertaining, and there were a handful of toys.

English-Yugoslav Hospital for Treatment of Osteoarticular Tuberculosis<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" /> was officially opened on September 23, 1934, under the auspices of Her Majesty Queen Maria Karađorđević. The first patients were transferred from a Belgrade hospital as early as August 1. The treatment was focused on patients suffering from tuberculosis of the bones and joints, [[Rickets|rachitis]]. The treatment consisted of fresh air, sun exposure, good food, rest, massage, immobilization with plaster and surgery if there was a need for it. The hospital received children under 14 years of age. During the year, there were up to 50 children, and over the winter, 32. The head of the hospital was MacPhail, the main surgeon was Svetislav Sojanović, the main nurse was Agnes Hardy, and Alice Murphy was a secretary. Among the staff, there were two other nurses, one teacher and auxiliary staff. One of the main problems of the hospital was funding, because the children were mostly treated for free. The cost of the hospital was covered by many donors. Among the donors, there was also the Ministry of Social Affairs and Public Health of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Child Protection Fund, as well as various other organizations. All of this was not enough to cover the cost of the hospital, so for this reason, MacPhail had to constantly run a fundraising campaign in order to keep the hospital in operation.

In 1940, the situation in the region became serious and the sanatorium staff began to prepare with the military against an enemy attack. In February 1941, MacPhail had a plan to evacuate children from the hospital. Three weeks before the war, all children were sent from the hospital to their homes, and all the hospital equipment was packed and sheltered in the basements to be protected in the event of a bombing. The situation become very serious and the British Embassy advised all British citizens to leave the country. Not leaving in time, she and other British residents became the prisoners of the Germans before she was repatriated to Britain.<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />

Soon thereafter, 120 soldiers were placed in the hospital for anti-aircraft patrols. The building was soon turned into a local hospital. The hospital staff often helped the partisan movement in the form of providing medical care and food, which was one of the reasons why the hospital was attacked. After that, the building was abandoned and destroyed. During the war years, the hospital also used hostile forces for its soldiers.

==Post-WWII==
MacPhail came to Belgrade after the liberation in 1945. When she went to visit Sremska Kamenica, she encountered a building that was without a door and windows, empty and ruined. There was no longer any medical or electrical equipment in it. In July, MacPhail began negotiations over the reopening of a hospital in Sremska Kamenica with the help of the Child Protection Fund from London. The Ministry of Public Health of the Democratic Federative Yugoslavia gave permission to start the reconstruction on August 15. With the help of staff, MacPhail managed to procure medical equipment and medical supplies as well as other necessary things to carry out the operation. From humanitarian organizations from Canada and the United Kingdom came bedding and blankets. The complete equipment from the surgery was found in a military hospital in [[Sremski Karlovci]] and was soon returned. Katherine also received 46 boxes of clothes and bedding for children from friends. The complete repair of the hospital was financed by the Government of the Autonomous Welfare of [[Vojvodina]], and the hospital was restarted on December 19, 1945.

During the war, the number of children who suffered from tuberculosis increased. The hospital now operated with a capacity of 75 beds and was permanently filled. The working conditions were difficult at that time due to the lack of equipment and food, as the supply of the hospital was very difficult. During this period, the fruit trees and vineyards that were around the hospital were of great help. Soon, life and work at the hospital returned to normal. However, the new government slowly increased the amount of mistrust towards MacPhail and her associates. She proposed to the Ministry of Health to turn the hospital into a rehabilitation center for children with disabilities, as well as for children who became disabled due to tuberculosis or other illnesses. She also planned to build a workshop where adults with disabilities would help in the production of orthopedic aids.

In 1947, the new regime decided to nationalize all hospitals and the Anglo-Yugoslav (Anglo-Serb.) Children's Hospital was handed over to the Yugoslav authorities in the autumn of that year. After nationalization, the hospital continued to exist as a state sanatorium for bone tuberculosis.

The hospital in Sremska Kamenica became a state property and as such, was part of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery of the Medical Faculty in Belgrade, led by Professor Svetislav Stojanovic. Realizing that nothing could prevent the implementation of the communist regime, MacPhail returned to Scotland in 1949, settling in [[St Andrews]].<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />

On 22 September 1954, to mark the 20th anniversary of the hospital's establishment, MacPhail visited the hospital in Sremska Kamenica and was warmly greeted warmly:— \"The hospital looked like before, fresh, exposed to the sun and surrounded by rich vineyards. The children attended school classes, freshly-prepared meal awaited the children every day thanks to the staff from the kitchen.\" A memorial plaque was placed in the entrance hall with the inscription that she was its founder. This memorial plaque was a great sign of gratitude for her contribution during the war. Apart from MacPhail, the ceremony were attended by Alice Marfi and Flora Sands.

MacPhail died in St Andrews, 11 September 1974.

==Honors and legacy==
[[File:RS058-15.jpg|thumb|Postage stamp issued by Serbian Mail, 2015]]
During the World War I, MacPhail was distinguished by the [[Order of St. Sava|Order of St Sava]] of the Fourth and Fifth degrees, and due to the humanitarian activities that followed the war, she received the Order of the Third Degree. Great Britain awarded her one of her greatest awards, the [[Order of the British Empire]]. When it was 1954, for the last time, she came to Serbia to visit her hospital in Sremska Kamenica on the occasion of  twenty years since its founding, MacPhail became an honorary citizen of Sremska Kamenica and the lifelong president of the Karlovac Red Cross. In the courtyard of the hospital, two memorial plaques were placed in her honor, and on June 15, 1988, a monument in her honor was also erected. In December 2015, the Serbian Mail issued commemorative stamps in her honor in partnership with the British Embassy in Belgrade.<ref name=\"bl.uk2016\" />

Her biography, ''Ever yours sincerely: the life and work of Dr Katherine S. MacPhail'' (Cambridge, 2007), was translated from Serbian to English by Želimir Dj. Mikić, from the original version in Serbian, ''Uvek vaša: život i delo dr Ketrin Makfejl.'' (Novi Sad, 1998).{{sfn|Mikić|2007|p=1}}<ref name=\"bl.uk2016\" />

'''Katherine Stewart MacPhail''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (30 October 1887 - 11 September 1974) was a Scottish surgeon. During [[World War I]], she served as Chief Medical Officer of two units of the [[Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service]]. She cared for the wounded in Serbia, France, and the [[Macedonian front|Thessaloniki Front]]. In 1921, during her stay in Serbia, she founded the country's first children's hospital.<ref name=\"bl.uk2016\">{{cite web |last1=Kerziouk |first1=Olga |title=Serbia celebrates British heroines of the First World War |url=https://blogs.bl.uk/european/2016/02/serbia-celebrates-british-heroines-of-the-first-world-war.html |publisher=British Library |accessdate=16 January 2019 |date=14 February 2016}}</ref> While she is remembered as a national hero in Serbia,<ref name=\"bbc.com\">{{cite news |title=Serbian stamps honour WW1 heroines |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-35039265 |accessdate=12 January 2019 |work=BBC News |date=8 December 2015}}</ref> she was criticized by some for providing her expertise in Serbia rather than in her own country.{{sfn|Oldfield|2001|p=148}} Her honors include several medals, plaques, and a postage stamp.

==Early years and education==
Katherine Stewart MacPhail was born in [[Glasgow]] on 30 October 1887, the third of four daughters of Jesse PacPhail and Dr Donald MacPhail, a doctor.{{sfn|The World's Children|1975|p=n.p.}} MacPhail was the only daughter in the family who showed an interest in her father's work. As a young girl, she entered the father's office and watched him examine the patients or treat wounds, she also went with him to visit the patients on remote farms. In addition, her decision to dedicate her life to medicine was probably influenced by her uncles who were successful doctors: James led the missionary hospital in India, and Alex was a professor of anatomy at the University of Glasgow.

MacPhail and her siblings' were initially home schooled by private teachers. Once they were old enough they attended the distant elementary school in [[Coatbridge]], going on to study at Hillhead Academy in [[Glasgow]]. All four children successfully completing their studies at the Academy, and later at the [[University of Glasgow]].
[[File:Др Кетрин Макфејл портрет.jpg|thumb|Graduation, 1905]]
At that time in Scotland, it was unusual for women to study at all, and especially medicine. Of the well-educated womeny from reputable families, they expected only to lead the household well and deal with art. Probably for this reason, her father was against his MacPhail's desire to study medicine. However, she had already demonstrated decisive determination and persistence, and he could not stand in the way of her decision. Her parents understood the importance of education, and on 26 April 1906 she enrolled to study medicine at the [[University of Glasgow]]. She was an excellent student, ane received numerous awards for her studies. She graduated on 12 October 1911 with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MB ChB]] from [[University of Glasgow Medical School]].{{sfn|Haines|Stevens|2001|p=192}}<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\">{{cite web |title=Surgeon Katherine S Macphail |url=https://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/ww1-biography/?id=4499 |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>

MacPhail began her medical career at the [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]] in Glasgow, and she was also an assistant doctor at her father's clinic.

==World War I==
===Scotland, 1914===
When [[World War I]] broke out, MacPhail decided to volunteer for active service in the [[British Army]] and sent a letter to the Ministry of War requesting to do so. The answer was fast, declining her request and explaining that the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] did not accept women. She turned to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], and received a similar response, as it too did not accept female doctors. She contacted [[Elsie Inglis|Dr Elsie Inglis]], who was recruiting women doctors and other medical staff for a women's volunteer medical units. Dr Inglis offered her hospital team to the British Ministry of War, but was rejected by the sentence: \"My dear lady, go home and sit still.\" Dr Inglis then sent letters to the embassies of France, Belgium, Russia and Serbia, who accepted this offer immediately and with gratitude.

From then, she began active work for the [[Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service]] which affiliated itself with the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffrage movement]]. As the units for France and Belgium had already been filled, MacPhail was in a dilemma whether to go to Serbia, which was little known in the United Kingdom at that time. MacPhail later said: \"I really hardly knew where Serbia was, but from what I read, I knew it was very difficult for them.\" MacPhail accepted the offer and joined as the youngest in a group of 30 women who comprised the staff of the first unit of the Scottish Women's Hospital in Serbia. Her sister Isabel accompanied her to function as an [[orderly]].<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />

===Serbia, 1915===
In mid-December 1914, MacPhail's group boarded a transport boat in Southampton. On the way to [[Malta]],{{sfn|Dositey Obradovich Circle|2009|p=116}} most members of the unit spent time learning Serbian. Immediately after Christmas, they boarded the ship \"Nile\", which sailed to [[Piraeus]]. They arrived in [[Thessaloniki]] on 1 January 1915, and the next day boarded a train for [[Kragujevac]], which was the headquarters of the Serbian army and military medical team. Though she was a junior doctor, she felt her skills were not being used appropriately.{{sfn|Sharp|Stibbe|2011|p=410}}<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />

In the year 1915, an epidemic of [[typhoid fever]] emerged among the Serbian army. In June 1915, when the epidemic was in decline, MacPhail became seriously ill with a severe form of the infection. Her hearing was damaged long-lasting high temperatures, and she lost her hair, so covered wore a hat or a scarf for a long time. When she was healed, on the insistence of [[Ernest Troubridge|Admiral Ernest Troubridge]], she left Serbia and returned to Scotland in order to recover completely. She reached Scotland in September 1915.

===France, 1916===
As soon as she had recovered sufficiently, MacPhail contacted the Serbian Support Fund in [[London]] and began a campaign to help the organization. She traveled all over Scotland, attended charity meetings and held lectures about her experiences in Serbia, appealing for help for the country.

As she was unable to return to Serbia, which at the time was behind enemy lines, in January 1916, she joined the charity \"Friends\", which worked in France. She worked at Shalona in Marni, in the [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne region]], northeast of [[Paris]]. In April 1916, she was offered a job in [[Corsica]], and in May 1916, arrived in [[Bastia]] to work at a hospital. A few days after her arrival she went to [[Ajaccio]], visiting a Scottish Women's Hospital. There, she met with several acquaintances she knew from Serbia, and they told her what was happening to their old unit. Finding that there were opportunities to return to Serbia, she interrupted her stay in Corsica, in order to try to organize the accommodation of Serbian orphans in the \"Friends\" home in the High Savai. Unfortunately, this failed. \"Friends\" took over a hotel in Samoan, about {{convert|20|km}} from the Swiss border, and turned it into a refugee camp. At the end of September 1916, MacPhail took over the duties of a doctor in this home. During her stay in France, Dr. Sondermayer, chief of the Sanitary Department of the Serbian Army, offered her a place in a hospital and MacPhail, immediately accepted the offer.{{sfn|American National Red Cross|1916|p=418}}

===Serbia, 1917===
[[File:На Солунском фронту 1917. године .jpg|thumb|left|MacPhail (sitting in the car) with colleagues, 1917.]]
[[File:Играње кола на Солунском фронту.jpg|thumb|Dancing the kolo with an Allied and a Serbian officer, amidst one of the regiments on the Thessaloniki front, ca. 1917–18.]]
In the early spring of 1917, MacPhail was on the [[Macedonian front|Thessaloniki front]]. In Thessaloniki, MacPhail located her younger sister, Isabel, who arrived there earlier with the Scottish Women's Hospital. Dr Sondermayer offered MacPhail and Isabel an opportunity to work in a newly formed large hospital, which France provided to the Serbian army, named the Serbian Hospital of Crown Prince [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]].

A few days later, they received an invitation from the head of the Serbian Relielf Fund in [[Thessaloniki]] to come to their hospital in Sorović (today the Greek town of [[Amyntaio]], near the Greek-Macedonian border) to help care for the injured civilian population during the bombing of [[Bitola#World War I|Bitola]] and the surrounding area. MacPhail and Isabel as well as two other nurses and a cook were sent to the village of Brod, on the south-eastern side of the Bitola area. Isabel soon left Brod and returned to Thessaloniki to work in the Serbian hospital of Crown Prince Alexander, while MacPhail remained behind. At the end of the year, she traveled to Thessaloniki, returning to Brod with a serious illness. She was sure that it was a disease that was caused by long-term poor nutrition, and later it was identified as [[pellagra]], then a little-known disease caused by a diet insufficient in vitamins.

At the end of 1917, the hospital of the Serbian Support Fund was moved from Sorović to [[Germijan]] near Brod, where MacPhail's outpatient clinic was closed to this village. At the same time, she approached her deadline to report to her post at the Serbian Hospital of Crown Prince Alexander in Thessaloniki. MacPhail was firmly convinced that her medical help was far more needed in the villages, so she managed to persuade Dr Sondermayer to let her remain in Bitola. At that time, MacPhail was visited by her friend, Dr Edward W. Ryan, whom she showed the poor living conditions in the nearby villages. Seeing this, Ryan immediately began collecting aid through the [[American Red Cross]], and managed to obtain a mobile outpatient unit, which was supplied with drugs and food supplies so that MacPhail could expand her work to improving the nutrition of vulnerable children.

During the winter of 1917/18, MacPhail was invited to a celebration where she first saw and met Crown Prince Alexander. In the Macedonian mountains, conditions were harsh and cold, but MacPhail with her mobile outpatient unit visited the surrounding villages regularly and did her job. In the meantime, her family and friends in Scotland collected warm clothes and footwear which Katherine shared with impoverished women and children.

===Scotland, 1918===
In the summer of 1918, MacPahil returned to Scotland for a short time to assist her father, Dr Donald MacPhail, who was working alone attending to patients who had contracted [[Spanish flu]]. When he contracted the flu, MacPhail and Isabel left,{{sfn|Miller|2018|p=233}} and the responsible parties accepted their reasons. MacPhail was distinguished by the [[Order of St. Sava]] IV class and the Medal of the Serbian Red Cross,<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" /> while Isabel received the Cross of Mercy. In August 1918, the sisters MacPhail left Thessaloniki and returned to their native Scotland.
[[File:Диплома .jpg|thumb|Certificate naming MacPhail as an honorary citizen of Coatbridge, 15 August 1918]]
In Scotland, MacPhail cared for her sick father and some of his patients. On 15 August 1918 MacPhail became an honorary citizen of Coatbridge, and at a special ceremony received the town's charter, and a gold watch.

MacPhail followed news of the offensives on the Tessaloniki front and the allies breakthrough in September 1918.

==Interwar period==
=== Return to Serbia===
At the end of November 1918 MacPhail returned to Serbia. Clothing, footwear and other supplies to help Serbia, were collected by her family, friends and patients, were packaged and sent separately via the Red Cross. From [[London]], MacPhail traveled to [[Paris]] and [[Toulon]] where she waited to board a ship to [[Dubrovnik]]. At that time Tulon was then crowded with refugees from Serbia, soldiers and civilians trying to return home. In Toulon she met Darinka Grujic, who had been taking care of Serbian orphans and refugees in France since the beginning of the war, which she wanted to return to Serbia. After several days waiting in Toulon, she embarked for Dubrovnik,then traveled for 3 days to Sarajevo, [[Zemun]] and finally Belgrade.

After her arrival in Belgrade MacPhail applied to the Ministry of the Interior and was granted permission to stay to carryout charity work.

====First Children's Hospital in Belgrade====
At the beginning of 1919, she opened the first children's hospital in Belgrade. This was facilitated by Darinka Grujic securing five military barracks in Studenicka Street, near the Military Hospital, and giving one of the barracks to MacPhail to establish a children's hospital. British marines, led by Admiral Troubridge, cleaned, repaired and outfitted the barrack. A steriliser was installed along with 25 military beds, bedding, blankets and other supplies from Red Cross. Drugs and military supplies came from the American Red Cross. The Serbian Support Fund opened a charity kitchen for a nearby school, so MacPhail managed to arrange to supply this kitchen with food as well as for children at the hospital, while firewood was provided by the city government. Troubridge received many toys and Florence Harvey offered to provide a car for free. At the end of January 1919, the hospital received its first patients.

During the first months of operation, every bed in the hospital was filled, and a large number of children attended the outpatient clinic. MacPhail performed all the medical work because there were few doctors as only about 100 had survived the war. Because of her work, MacPhail was popular in Belgrade, and was able to provide various types of assistance and donations for those who lacked financial means.

====Pavilion in Topčider====
[[File:Пацијенти у Топчидерском павиљону.jpg|thumb|Patients at Topčider Pavilion]]
By spring of 1919, the hospital was already too small in particular due to an increase in the number of children with [[tuberculosis]]. MacPhail learned that there was an empty and abandoned open pavilion that was previously used for children at [[Topčider]], {{convert|10|km}} from Belgrade/ The pavilion was located on a hill, at the edge of a forest, so it was ideal for a treatment consisting of fresh air and sun, which, in addition to good food and rest, was at that time the only medicine for tuberculosis. MacPhail was granted a permit from the city government to arrange necessary repairs for the building and to procure equipment. By Easter 1919 the 40 bed pavilion received its first patients. It was managed by Mary Baker and soon proved to be successful with many children recovering. As an open pavilion it was only used in the summer months. It closed in 1924.

====Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital====
[[File:Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital surgical ward.png|thumb|Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital surgical ward]]
As the work expanded, MacPhail realized that the existing capacities would soon be insufficient for an increasing number of patients, especially because the top of the pavilion made it unusable in the winter, so she began to think about expanding the hospital. An enlarged building in Kneza Milosa Street, near the Military Hospital, was left empty when British marines left Belgrade and MacPhail immediately started the action to get that house for her hospital. It was a large, bright, well-built and preserved building that had enough space to accommodate 50 beds, especially when MacPhail succeeded in replacing large military beds for children's beds. In addition, a small operating room for easy surgical cases was formed, while severe surgical cases were sent to the state hospital. A large department for outpatient patients was also established. This new hospital began operating in November 1919, though it officially opened in February 1921. It was no longer an improvised institution, but a real medical institution. It was officially recognized by the Government of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as the first Children's Hospital in Serbia, called the Anglo-Serb Children's Hospital, abbreviated ASCH. It was the only children's hospital in what was now [[Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Oldfield|2001|p=149}} Shortly after the opening of this hospital, the Ministry of Health asked MacPhail to receive infants and newborns, so a special nursing department was also set up with treatment provided by the most experienced nurse. By 1921, MacPhail was hopeful to not only perfect this hospital, but to encourage the foundation of others and to train native nurses to work in them.{{sfn|The Hospital|1921|p=5}}

===Dubrovnik===
[[File:Ени Макфејл.jpg|thumb|MacPhail (left) and her colleague preparing food on the terrace \"Villa Bravačić\" in Dubrovnik, ca. 1920-1921]]
As the number of patients at Topcider had been steadily increasing, MacPhail came to the idea of finding a place on the seashore where she could accommodate children with tuberculous. She learned that there is a villa in [[Dubrovnik]] that would be ideal for this purpose. MacPhail contacted [[Zivojin Mišić]] who was then the head of the generalštab and whom MacPhail knew from the Thessaloniki front. When MacPhail explained to him that this villa in Dubrovnik should serve as a health center and a children's rest home, he immediately ordered the villa to be handed over to the English-Serbian children's hospital for further use. MacPhail's sister, Isabel, who was already doing volunteer work at the Children's Hospital in Belgrade, traveled to Dubrovnik to see the building and to try and find the equipment for her. While she was in Dubrovnik, Isabel heard of an abandoned Austrian hospital near [[Zelenika]] in [[Bay of Kotor|Boka Kotorska]] and traveled there to see what it was about. To her surprise, she found a deserted but fully equipped hospital, with beds, bedding and other material, and a young Serbian officer who kept all of this with his soldiers. It was Vasa Srdi. He offered for Isabel to take everything she needed, and in addition, he immediately arranged shipping and transport of equipment to Dubrovnik. Isabel chose 60 beds together and other equipment and returned to Dubrovnik. As the building itself was well preserved, the hospital was established in February 1920.

===Sremska Kamenica===
In the early 1930s, a report was submitted regarding the Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital stating that during the preceding two years, 115 hospital patients were hospitalized (hospitalization of some patients lasted up to 24 months), and 160 children were treated clinically, or outside the hospital. There were also 25 surgical procedures, 194 punctures and 113 X-ray imaging, and 84 immunizations with gypsum were performed. Fifty children left the hospital as successfully cured, 12 of them had improved health status during discharge, and the rest was on further treatment. The conclusion was that in spite of the small number of beds and a limited fund owned by the Anglo-Yugoslav hospital, she managed to fulfill all the tasks. The enormous costs of maintaining a hospital in Belgrade had become increasingly high year after year, and this, among other reasons, influenced MacPhail to start thinking about moving the hospital somewhere in the interior of the country, but not too far from Belgrade, which would be in open air with fresh air and sun. She even thought about buying one of the abandoned [[Fruška Gora]] monasteries. Darinka Grujic advised her to try to find a suitable building or to build a new building in [[Sremska Kamenica]], which according to its natural conditions, was the most suitable place for this purpose. As MacPhail already had a holiday home in Sremska Kamenica, she immediately started making plans for the establishment of a new hospital.

MacPhail's old friend, Eng. Vasa Srdić had been an officer of the Serbian army in Zelenika in the early 1920s He had helped Isabel and subsequently became a great friend of the sisters MacPhail. After the war, as a graduate engineer of agronomy, he got land in [[Temerin]], where he settled and was engaged in farming and fruit growing. Being aware of MacPhail's plans, he soon learned that on the hill Čardak, just above Sremska Kamenica, an old and abandoned vineyard was being sold which could suit MacPhail's plans. She was thrilled with the position of the city itself and its surroundings and bought the land, which was officially conveyed to her on August 1, 1933, and immediately began preparations for the construction of the hospital. According to Ketrin's idea and with the help of an engineer of the Hygienic Institute in Belgrade, an old Russian architect made plans for a three-winged building with a central courtyard and a long terrace along the north and west wing so that children can be in the sun all day.

In the spring of 1934, the work on the new hospital was completed, all necessary equipment was ordered, and lists of patients scheduled to start treatment were compiled. The Royal Commission of the Danube Banovina approved the opening of the children's sanatorium. The building consisted of a main frontal area and two symmetrically situated wings. The main part consisted of three departments of the hospital, a patient unit, a workshop, a radiotherapy department, a pharmacy section, a space intended for patients with infectious diseases and rooms for the sterilization of instruments and appliances. Also, there was an area for the administration of the hospital, as well as a warehouse for medicines and instruments. In the wings of the buildingm there was a kitchen with a pantry and a dining room for children. On the first floor were four-room dormitories for doctors and nurses. There were also four bathrooms and toilets arranged in the wings of the building. The hospital was built in accordance with the needs of patients who anticipated a longer stay for treatment. There were terraces in front of the south and west wings. Even the courtyard was fenced and decorated like a park. The orchard and vineyard were also located within the yard.

The principle treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis at the time when antibiotics and antituberculotics did not exist consisted of increasing the general resistance of patients with hygienic and dietary regimen, fresh air therapy, heliotherapy (exposure to the sun during the day, during the winter exposure to artificial light), immobilization and various surgical procedures. Special attention was also paid to hospital hygiene. School-age children attended daily classes that corresponded to their age and curriculum, after which they would receive a certificate at the end of the school year. The hospital also organized workshops that were part of the work therapy, where children attended art classes. Once a week, the Orthodox priest would come to provide the children with religious instruction. The hospital also had a library that was equipped with a large number of children's books, which were both educational and entertaining, and there were a handful of toys.

English-Yugoslav Hospital for Treatment of Osteoarticular Tuberculosis<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" /> was officially opened on September 23, 1934, under the auspices of Her Majesty Queen Maria Karađorđević. The first patients were transferred from a Belgrade hospital as early as August 1. The treatment was focused on patients suffering from tuberculosis of the bones and joints, [[Rickets|rachitis]]. The treatment consisted of fresh air, sun exposure, good food, rest, massage, immobilization with plaster and surgery if there was a need for it. The hospital received children under 14 years of age. During the year, there were up to 50 children, and over the winter, 32. The head of the hospital was MacPhail, the main surgeon was Svetislav Sojanović, the main nurse was Agnes Hardy, and Alice Murphy was a secretary. Among the staff, there were two other nurses, one teacher and auxiliary staff. One of the main problems of the hospital was funding, because the children were mostly treated for free. The cost of the hospital was covered by many donors. Among the donors, there was also the Ministry of Social Affairs and Public Health of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Child Protection Fund, as well as various other organizations. All of this was not enough to cover the cost of the hospital, so for this reason, MacPhail had to constantly run a fundraising campaign in order to keep the hospital in operation.

In 1940, the situation in the region became serious and the sanatorium staff began to prepare with the military against an enemy attack. In February 1941, MacPhail had a plan to evacuate children from the hospital. Three weeks before the war, all children were sent from the hospital to their homes, and all the hospital equipment was packed and sheltered in the basements to be protected in the event of a bombing. The situation become very serious and the British Embassy advised all British citizens to leave the country. Not leaving in time, she and other British residents became the prisoners of the Germans before she was repatriated to Britain.<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />

Soon thereafter, 120 soldiers were placed in the hospital for anti-aircraft patrols. The building was soon turned into a local hospital. The hospital staff often helped the partisan movement in the form of providing medical care and food, which was one of the reasons why the hospital was attacked. After that, the building was abandoned and destroyed. During the war years, the hospital also used hostile forces for its soldiers.

==Post-WWII==
MacPhail came to Belgrade after the liberation in 1945. When she went to visit Sremska Kamenica, she encountered a building that was without a door and windows, empty and ruined. There was no longer any medical or electrical equipment in it. In July, MacPhail began negotiations over the reopening of a hospital in Sremska Kamenica with the help of the Child Protection Fund from London. The Ministry of Public Health of the Democratic Federative Yugoslavia gave permission to start the reconstruction on August 15. With the help of staff, MacPhail managed to procure medical equipment and medical supplies as well as other necessary things to carry out the operation. From humanitarian organizations from Canada and the United Kingdom came bedding and blankets. The complete equipment from the surgery was found in a military hospital in [[Sremski Karlovci]] and was soon returned. Katherine also received 46 boxes of clothes and bedding for children from friends. The complete repair of the hospital was financed by the Government of the Autonomous Welfare of [[Vojvodina]], and the hospital was restarted on December 19, 1945.

During the war, the number of children who suffered from tuberculosis increased. The hospital now operated with a capacity of 75 beds and was permanently filled. The working conditions were difficult at that time due to the lack of equipment and food, as the supply of the hospital was very difficult. During this period, the fruit trees and vineyards that were around the hospital were of great help. Soon, life and work at the hospital returned to normal. However, the new government slowly increased the amount of mistrust towards MacPhail and her associates. She proposed to the Ministry of Health to turn the hospital into a rehabilitation center for children with disabilities, as well as for children who became disabled due to tuberculosis or other illnesses. She also planned to build a workshop where adults with disabilities would help in the production of orthopedic aids.

In 1947, the new regime decided to nationalize all hospitals and the Anglo-Yugoslav (Anglo-Serb.) Children's Hospital was handed over to the Yugoslav authorities in the autumn of that year. After nationalization, the hospital continued to exist as a state sanatorium for bone tuberculosis.

The hospital in Sremska Kamenica became a state property and as such, was part of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery of the Medical Faculty in Belgrade, led by Professor Svetislav Stojanovic. Realizing that nothing could prevent the implementation of the communist regime, MacPhail returned to Scotland in 1949, settling in [[St Andrews]].<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />

On 22 September 1954, to mark the 20th anniversary of the hospital's establishment, MacPhail visited the hospital in Sremska Kamenica and was warmly greeted warmly:— \"The hospital looked like before, fresh, exposed to the sun and surrounded by rich vineyards. The children attended school classes, freshly-prepared meal awaited the children every day thanks to the staff from the kitchen.\" A memorial plaque was placed in the entrance hall with the inscription that she was its founder. This memorial plaque was a great sign of gratitude for her contribution during the war. Apart from MacPhail, the ceremony were attended by Alice Marfi and Flora Sands.

MacPhail died in St Andrews, 11 September 1974.

==Honors and legacy==
[[File:RS058-15.jpg|thumb|Postage stamp issued by Serbian Mail, 2015]]
During the World War I, MacPhail was distinguished by the [[Order of St. Sava|Order of St Sava]] of the Fourth and Fifth degrees, and due to the humanitarian activities that followed the war, she received the Order of the Third Degree. Great Britain awarded her one of her greatest awards, the [[Order of the British Empire]]. When it was 1954, for the last time, she came to Serbia to visit her hospital in Sremska Kamenica on the occasion of  twenty years since its founding, MacPhail became an honorary citizen of Sremska Kamenica and the lifelong president of the Karlovac Red Cross. In the courtyard of the hospital, two memorial plaques were placed in her honor, and on June 15, 1988, a monument in her honor was also erected. In December 2015, the Serbian Mail issued commemorative stamps in her honor in partnership with the British Embassy in Belgrade.<ref name=\"bl.uk2016\" />

Her biography, ''Ever yours sincerely: the life and work of Dr Katherine S. MacPhail'' (Cambridge, 2007), was translated from Serbian to English by Želimir Dj.

{{History of Uganda}}

The '''British Protectorate of Uganda''' was a [[protectorate]] of the [[British Empire]] from 1894 to 1962. In 1893 the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] transferred its administration rights of territory consisting mainly of [[Buganda Kingdom]] to the British Government.

In 1894 the Uganda Protectorate was established, and the territory was extended beyond the borders of Buganda to an area that roughly corresponds to that of present-day [[Uganda]].

==Background==
===Civil war===
In the mid 1880s, the [[Kingdom of Buganda]] was divided between four religious factions - pagans, [[Catholics]], [[Protestants]] and [[Muslims]] - each vying for political control.<ref name=\"Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94\">Griffiths, Tudor. “Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94.” Journal of Religion in Africa, vol. 31, no. 1, 2001, pp. 92–114. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1581815.</ref>  In 1888, [[Mwanga II of Buganda|Mwanga II]] was ousted in a coup led by the Muslim faction, who installed [[Kalema of Buganda|Kalema]] as leader. The following year, a Protestant and Catholic coalition formed to remove Kalema and return [[Mwanga II of Buganda|Mwanga II]] to power. This coalition secured an alliance with the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]], and succeeded in ousting Kalema and reinstating Mwanga in 1890.<ref name=\"Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94\"/>

The IBEAC sent [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Frederick Lugard]] to Bugunda in 1890 as its chief representative and to help maintain the peace between the competing factions. In 1891, Mwanga concluded a treaty with Lugard whereby Mwanga would place his land and tributary states under the protection of the IBEAC.<ref>Gray, John, and Carl Peters. “Anglo-German Relations in Uganda, 1890-1892.” The Journal of African History, vol. 1, no. 2, 1960, pp. 281–297. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/180246.</ref>

In 1892, having subdued the Muslim faction, the Protestants and Catholics resumed their struggle for supremacy which led to civil war.<ref name=\"Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94\"/> That same year, the British government extended their support for the IBEAC to remain in Buganda until 1893. Despite strong opposition to getting involved in Buganda, the government felt that withdrawal of British influence would lead to war and the threat of a fellow European power encroaching on Britain's sphere of influence in East Africa agreed with Germany in 1890.<ref name=\"Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94\"/>

On 31 March 1893, the IBEAC formally ended its involvement in Uganda. Missionaries, led by [[Alfred Tucker]], lobbied the British government to take over the administration of Uganda in place of the IBEAC, arguing that British withdrawal would lead to a continuance of the civil war between the different religious factions.<ref name=\"Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94\"/>  Shortly after, [[Gerald Portal|Sir Gerald Portal]], a representative of the British government on the ground in Uganda, proposed a plan of double chieftainships - whereby every chieftanship would have one Protestant and one Catholic chief. On 19 April 1893, the British government and the chiefs of Uganda signed a treaty giving effect to this plan.<ref name=\"Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94\"/>

On 18 June 1894, the British government declared that Uganda would come under British protection as a [[Protectorate]].

==British rule==
===1894–1901===
The [[Buganda Agreement (1900)|Uganda Agreement of 1900]] solidified the power of the largely Protestant 'Bakungu' client-chiefs, led by Kagwa. London sent only a few officials to administer the country, relying primarily on the 'Bakungu' chiefs. For decades they were preferred because of their political skills, their Christianity, their friendly relations with the British, their ability to collect taxes, and the proximity of Entebbe (the Ugandan capital) to the Buganda capital. By the 1920s the British administrators were more confident and had less need for military or administrative support. Colonial officials taxed cash crops produced by the peasants. There was popular discontent among the Baganda rank-and-file, which weakened the position of their leaders. In 1912 Kagwa moved to solidify 'Bakungu' power by proposing a second 'Lukiko' for Buganda with himself as president and the 'Bakungu' as a sort of hereditary aristocracy. British officials vetoed the idea when they discovered widespread popular opposition. Instead, British officials began some reforms and attempted to make the 'Lukiko' a genuine representative assembly.<ref>Michael Twaddle, \"The Bakungu chiefs of Buganda under British colonial rule, 1900–1930.\" ''Journal of African History'' 10#2 (1969): 309-322.</ref>

[[File:The White Elephant, Punch 103.png|thumb|''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon depicting Uganda personified as a [[White elephant]] which the [[Imperial British East Africa Company|East Africa Company]] is attempting to sell to Britain (1892)]]
Although momentous change occurred during the colonial era in [[Uganda]], some characteristics of late-nineteenth-century African society survived to reemerge at the time of independence. The status of [[Protectorate]] had significantly different consequences for Uganda than had the region been made a colony like neighboring [[Kenya]], insofar as Uganda retained a degree of self-government that would have otherwise been limited under a full colonial administration.

Colonial rule, however, affected local economic systems dramatically, in part because the first concern of the British was financial. Quelling the 1897 mutiny (see [[Uganda before 1900]]) had been costly—units of the [[British Indian Army]] had been transported to Uganda at considerable expense. The new commissioner of Uganda in 1900, Sir [[Harry H. Johnston]], had orders to establish an efficient administration and to levy taxes as quickly as possible. Johnston approached the chiefs in [[Buganda]] with offers of jobs in the colonial administration in return for their collaboration.

The chiefs, were more interested in preserving Buganda as a self-governing entity, continuing the royal line of [[Kabaka of Buganda|kabakas]], and securing private land tenure for themselves and their supporters. Hard bargaining ensued, but the chiefs ended up with everything they wanted, including one-half of all the land in Buganda. The half left to the British as \"Crown Land\" was later found to be largely swamp and scrub.

Johnston's [[Buganda Agreement of 1900]] imposed a tax on huts and guns, designated the chiefs as tax collectors, and testified to the continued alliance of British and Baganda interests. The British signed much less generous treaties with the other kingdoms ([[Toro (kingdom)|Toro]] in 1900, [[Ankole]] in 1901, and [[Bunyoro]] in 1933) without the provision of large-scale private land tenure. The smaller chiefdoms of [[Busoga]] were ignored.

=== Buganda administrators ===
The Baganda immediately offered their services to the British as administrators over their recently conquered neighbours, an offer which was attractive to the economy-minded colonial administration. Baganda agents fanned out as local tax collectors and labour organizers in areas such as [[Kigezi]], [[Mbale]], and, significantly, Bunyoro. This subimperialism and Ganda cultural chauvinism were resented by the people being administered.

Wherever they went, Baganda insisted on the exclusive use of their language, [[Luganda language|Luganda]], and they planted [[banana]]s as the only proper food worth eating. They regarded their traditional dress—long cotton gowns called [[kanzu]]s—as civilized; all else was barbarian. They also encouraged and engaged in mission work, attempting to convert locals to their form of Christianity or Islam. In some areas, the resulting backlash aided the efforts of religious rivals—for example, Catholics won converts in areas where oppressive rule was identified with a Protestant [[Muganda]] chief.

The people of [[Bunyoro]] were particularly aggrieved, having fought the Baganda and the British; having a substantial section of their heartland annexed to Buganda as the \"lost counties\", and finally having \"arrogant\" Baganda administrators issuing orders, collecting taxes, and forcing unpaid labour. In 1907 the Banyoro rose in a rebellion called ''nyangire'', or \"refusing\", and succeeded in having the Baganda subimperial agents withdrawn.

Meanwhile, in 1901 the completion of the [[Uganda Railway]] from the coast at [[Mombasa]] to the [[Lake Victoria]] port of [[Kisumu]] moved colonial authorities to encourage the growth of cash crops to help pay the railway's operating costs. Another result of the railway construction was the 1902 decision to transfer the eastern section of the Uganda Protectorate to the [[Kenya Colony]], then called the [[East Africa Protectorate]], to keep the entire line under one local colonial administration. Because the railway experienced cost overruns in Kenya, the British decided to justify its exceptional expense and pay its operating costs by introducing large-scale European settlement in a vast tract of land that became a centre of cash-crop agriculture known as the \"[[White Highlands]]\". A major part of the territory eventually left off of the \"East Africa Protectorate\" was the [[Uganda Scheme]], in which the British Empire offered to create a Jewish nation-state. The offer was made to the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist movement]] which rejected it, refusing to accept anything other than the ancient Land of Israel.

In many areas of Uganda, by contrast, agricultural production was placed in the hands of Africans, if they responded to the opportunity. Cotton was the crop of choice, largely because of pressure by the [[British Cotton Growing Association]], textile manufacturers who urged the colonies to provide raw materials for British mills. This was done by cash cropping the land. Even the [[Church Mission Society|CMS]] joined the effort by launching the [[Uganda Company]] (managed by a former missionary) to promote cotton planting and to buy and transport the produce.

Buganda, with its strategic location on the lakeside, reaped the benefits of cotton growing. The advantages of this crop were quickly recognized by the Baganda chiefs who had newly acquired freehold estates, which came to be known as [[mailo land]] because they were measured in square miles. In 1905 the initial baled cotton export was valued at £200; in 1906, £1,000; in 1907; £11,000; and in 1908, £52,000. By 1915 the value of cotton exports had climbed to £369,000, and Britain was able to end its subsidy of colonial administration in Uganda, while in Kenya the white settlers required continuing subsidies by the home government.

The income generated by cotton sales made the Buganda kingdom relatively prosperous, compared with the rest of colonial Uganda, although before [[World War I]] cotton was also being grown in the eastern regions of [[Busoga]], [[Lango sub-region|Lango]], and [[Teso sub-region|Teso]]. Many Baganda spent their new earnings on imported clothing, bicycles, metal roofing, and even cars. They also invested in their children's education. The Christian missions emphasized literacy skills, and African converts quickly learned to read and write. By 1911 two popular journals, ''Ebifa'' (News) and ''Munno'' (Your Friend), were published monthly in Luganda.

Heavily supported by African funds, new schools were soon turning out graduating classes at Mengo High School, St. Mary's Kisubi, Namilyango, Gayaza, and [[King's College Budo]] — all in Buganda. The chief minister of the Buganda kingdom, Sir [[Apolo Kaggwa]], personally awarded a bicycle to the top graduate at [[King's College Budo]], together with the promise of a government job. The schools, in fact, had inherited the educational function formerly performed in the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]]'s palace, where generations of young pages had been trained to become chiefs. Now the qualifications sought were literacy and skills, including typing and English translation.

Two important principles of precolonial political life carried over into the colonial era: clientage, whereby ambitious younger officeholders attached themselves to older high-ranking chiefs, and generational conflict, which resulted when the younger generation sought to expel their elders from office in order to replace them. After World War I, the younger aspirants to high office in Buganda became impatient with the seemingly perpetual tenure of Sir Apolo and his contemporaries, who lacked many of the skills that members of the younger generation had acquired through schooling. Calling themselves the [[Young Baganda Association]], members of the new generation attached themselves to the young kabaka, [[Daudi Chwa]], who was the figurehead ruler of Buganda under indirect rule. But Kabaka Daudi never gained real political power, and after a short and frustrating reign, he died at the relatively young age of forty-three.

===First World War era military forces===
Early on in the Protectorate's history of occupation the British colonial government had recognised the need for a local defence force.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lwanga-Luwyiigo|first1=Sanwiri|title=The Colonial Roots of Internal Conflict in Uganda|date=25 September 1987|issue=Makerere University|page=8|url=https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/123456789/1412/ISIC%2017-The%20colonial%20roots%20of%20internal%20conflict%20in%20Uganda%20-%20331408.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref> In 1895 the British colonial armed force in the Protectorate was the Uganda Rifles, who were formed as an internal security force (i.e. keeping the peace in tribal areas rather than defending against external aggression).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Omara-Otunnu|first1=Amii|title=Politics and the Military in Uganda, 1890–1985|date=1987|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781349187362|pages=19–21|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I9evCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=%22Uganda+Rifles%22#v=onepage|accessdate=13 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lwanga-Luwyiigo|first1=Sanwiri|title=The Colonial Roots of Internal Conflict in Uganda|date=25 September 1987|issue=Makerere University|page=7|url=https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/123456789/1412/ISIC%2017-The%20colonial%20roots%20of%20internal%20conflict%20in%20Uganda%20-%20331408.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref> In the late 19th Century the local defence force was largely composed of Sudanese troops brought in by the British, these troops were commanded by a mix of British and Sudanese officers, local tribes were not that evident in this force defending the interests of the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]].

Most of this recruitment was done from the northern part of the protectorate especially the Acholi sub-region. The British colonial administration had also fought with the Lamogi clan of the Acholi People in what that culminated in to the Lamogi Rebellion.

==1920 to 1961==
{{Uganda Protectorate imagemap}}
Far more promising as a source of political support were the British colonial officers, who welcomed the typing and translation skills of school graduates and advanced the careers of their favourites. The contest was decided after World War I, when an influx of British ex-military officers, now serving as district commissioners, began to feel that self-government was an obstacle to good government. Specifically, they accused Sir Apolo and his generation of inefficiency, abuse of power, and failure to keep adequate financial accounts—charges that were not hard to document.

Sir Apolo resigned in 1926, at about the same time that a host of elderly Baganda chiefs were replaced by a new generation of officeholders. The Buganda treasury was also audited that year for the first time. Although it was not a nationalist organization, the Young Baganda Association claimed to represent popular African dissatisfaction with the old order. As soon as the younger Baganda had replaced the older generation in office, however, their objections to privilege accompanying power ceased. The pattern persisted in Ugandan politics up to and after independence.

The commoners, who had been labouring on the cotton estates of the chiefs before World War I, did not remain servile. As time passed, they bought small parcels of land from their erstwhile landlords. This land fragmentation was aided by the British, who in 1927 forced the chiefs to limit severely the rents and obligatory labour they could demand from their tenants. Thus the oligarchy of landed chiefs who had emerged with the Buganda Agreement of 1900 declined in importance, and agricultural production shifted to independent smallholders, who grew cotton, and later coffee, for the export market.

Unlike [[Tanganyika]], which was devastated during the prolonged fighting between Britain and Germany in the [[East African Campaign of World War I]], Uganda prospered from wartime agricultural production. After the population losses from disease during the era of conquest and at the turn of the century (particularly the devastating [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] epidemic of 1900- 1906), Uganda's population was growing again. Even the 1930s depression seemed to affect smallholder cash farmers in Uganda less severely than it did the white settler producers in Kenya. Ugandans simply grew their own food until rising prices made export crops attractive again.

Two issues continued to create grievance through the 1930s and 1940s. The colonial government strictly regulated the buying and processing of cash crops, setting prices and reserving the role of intermediary for Asians, who were thought to be more efficient. The British and Asians firmly repelled African attempts to break into cotton ginning. In addition, on the Asian-owned sugar plantations established in the 1920s, labour for sugar-cane and other cash crops was increasingly provided by migrants from peripheral areas of Uganda and even from outside Uganda.

==Independence==
In 1949 discontented Baganda rioted and burned down the houses of pro-government chiefs. The rioters had three demands: the right to bypass government price controls on the export sales of cotton, the removal of the Asian monopoly over cotton ginning, and the right to have their own representatives in local government replace chiefs appointed by the British. They were critical as well of the young kabaka, [[Mutesa II|Frederick Walugembe Mutesa II]] (also known as \"King Freddie\" or \"Kabaka Freddie\"), for his inattention to the needs of his people. The British governor, Sir [[John Hall (colonial administrator)|John Hall]], regarded the riots as the work of communist-inspired agitators and rejected the suggested reforms.

[[File:BEA-KUT 1958 MiNr0094I pm B002.jpg|thumb|200px|Stamp of British East Africa with a portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]]]
Far from leading the people into confrontation, Uganda's would-be agitators were slow to respond to popular discontent. Nevertheless, the [[Uganda African Farmers Union]], founded by [[I.K. Musazi]] in 1947, was blamed for the riots and was banned by the British. Musazi's [[Uganda National Congress]] replaced the farmers union in 1952 when it was set up with [[Abu Mayanja]] as its first Secretary General, but because the congress remained a casual discussion group more than an organized political party, it stagnated and came to an end just two years after its inception.

Meanwhile, the British began to move ahead of the Ugandans in preparing for independence. The effects of Britain's postwar withdrawal from [[India]], the march of nationalism in [[West Africa]], and a more liberal philosophy in the [[Colonial Office]] geared toward future self-rule all began to be felt in Uganda. The embodiment of these issues arrived in 1952 in the person of a new and energetic reformist governor, [[Andrew Cohen (statesman)|Sir Andrew Cohen]] (formerly undersecretary for African affairs in the Colonial Office).

Cohen set about preparing Uganda for independence. On the economic side, he removed obstacles to African cotton ginning, rescinded price discrimination against African-grown coffee, encouraged cooperatives, and established the [[Uganda Development Corporation]] to promote and finance new projects. On the political side, he reorganized the Legislative Council, which had consisted of an unrepresentative selection of interest groups heavily favouring the European community, to include African representatives elected from districts throughout Uganda. This system became a prototype for the future parliament.

===Power politics in Buganda===
The prospect of elections caused a sudden proliferation of new political parties. This development alarmed the old-guard leaders within the Uganda kingdoms, because they realized that the centre of power would be at the national level. The spark that ignited wider opposition to Governor Cohen's reforms was a 1953 speech in London in which the secretary of state for colonies referred to the possibility of a federation of the three East African territories (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika), similar to that established in central Africa.

Many Ugandans were aware of the [[Central African Federation]] of [[Rhodesia]] and [[Nyasaland]] (later [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]], and [[Malawi]]) and its domination by white settler interests. Ugandans deeply feared the prospect of an East African federation dominated by the settlers of Kenya, which was then in the midst of the bitter [[Mau Mau]] uprising. They had vigorously resisted a similar suggestion by the 1930 [[Hilton Young Commission]]. Confidence in Cohen vanished just as the governor was preparing to urge Buganda to recognize that its special status would have to be sacrificed in the interests of a new and larger nation-state.

Mutesa II, who had been regarded by his subjects as uninterested in their welfare, now refused to cooperate with Cohen's plan for an integrated Buganda. Instead, he demanded that Buganda be separated from the rest of the protectorate and transferred to Foreign Office jurisdiction. Cohen's response to this crisis was to deport the kabaka to a comfortable exile in London. His forced departure made the kabaka an instant martyr in the eyes of the Baganda, whose latent separatism and anticolonial sentiments set off a storm of protest. Cohen's action had backfired, and he could find no one among the Baganda prepared or able to mobilize support for his schemes. After two frustrating years of unrelenting Ganda hostility and obstruction, Cohen was forced to reinstate [[Kabaka Freddie]].

The negotiations leading to the kabaka's return had an outcome similar to the negotiations of Commissioner Johnston in 1900; although appearing to satisfy the British, they were a resounding victory for the Baganda. Cohen secured the kabaka's agreement not to oppose independence within the larger Uganda framework. Not only was the kabaka reinstated in return, but for the first time since 1889, the monarch was given the power to appoint and dismiss his chiefs (Buganda government officials) instead of acting as a mere figurehead while they conducted the affairs of government.

The kabaka's new power was cloaked in the misleading claim that he would be only a \"constitutional monarch\", while in fact he was a leading player in deciding how Uganda would be governed. A new grouping of Baganda calling themselves \"the King's Friends\" rallied to the kabaka's defence. They were conservative, fiercely loyal to Buganda as a kingdom, and willing to entertain the prospect of participation in an independent Uganda only if it were headed by the kabaka. Baganda politicians who did not share this vision or who were opposed to the \"King's Friends\" found themselves branded as the \"King's Enemies\", which meant political and social ostracism.

The major exception to this rule were the Roman Catholic Baganda who had formed their own party, the [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party]] (DP), led by [[Benedicto Kiwanuka]]. Many Catholics had felt excluded from the Protestant-dominated establishment in Buganda ever since Lugard's Maxim had turned the tide in 1892. The kabaka had to be Protestant, and he was invested in a coronation ceremony modelled on that of British monarchs (who are invested by the Church of England's Archbishop of Canterbury) that took place at the main Protestant church. Religion and politics were equally inseparable in the other kingdoms throughout Uganda. The DP had Catholic as well as other adherents and was probably the best organized of all the parties preparing for elections. It had printing presses and the backing of the popular newspaper, Munno, which was published at the St. Mary's Kisubi mission.

Elsewhere in Uganda, the emergence of the kabaka as a political force provoked immediate hostility. Political parties and local interest groups were riddled with divisions and rivalries, but they shared one concern: they were determined not to be dominated by Buganda. In 1960 a political organizer from Lango, [[Milton Obote]], seized the initiative and formed a new party, the [[Uganda People's Congress]] (UPC), as a coalition of all those outside the Roman Catholic-dominated DP who opposed Buganda hegemony.

The steps Cohen had initiated to bring about the independence of a unified Uganda state had led to a polarization between factions from Buganda and those opposed to its domination. Buganda's population in 1959 was 2 million, out of Uganda's total of 6 million. Even discounting the many non-Baganda resident in Buganda, there were at least 1 million people who owed allegiance to the kabaka—too many to be overlooked or shunted aside, but too few to dominate the country as a whole.

At the London Conference of 1960, it was obvious that Buganda autonomy and a strong unitary government were incompatible, but no compromise emerged, and the decision on the form of government was postponed. The British announced that elections would be held in March 1961 for \"responsible government\", the next-to-last stage of preparation before the formal granting of independence. It was assumed that those winning the election would gain valuable experience in office, preparing them for the probable responsibility of governing after independence.

In Buganda the \"King's Friends\" urged a total boycott of the election because their attempts to secure promises of future autonomy had been rebuffed. Consequently, when the voters went to the polls throughout Uganda to elect eighty-two [[National Assembly of Uganda|National Assembly]] members, in Buganda only the Roman Catholic supporters of the DP braved severe public pressure and voted, capturing twenty of Buganda's twenty-one allotted seats. This artificial situation gave the DP a majority of seats, although they had a minority of 416,000 votes nationwide versus 495,000 for the UPC. Benedicto Kiwanuka became the new chief minister of Uganda.

Shocked by the results, the Baganda separatists, who formed a political party called [[Kabaka Yekka]], had second thoughts about the wisdom of their election boycott. They quickly welcomed the recommendations of a British commission that proposed a future federal form of government. According to these recommendations, Buganda would enjoy a measure of internal autonomy if it participated fully in the national government.

For its part, the UPC was equally anxious to eject its DP rivals from government before they became entrenched. Obote reached an understanding with Kabaka Freddie and the KY, accepting Buganda's special federal relationship and even a provision by which the kabaka could appoint Buganda's representatives to the National Assembly, in return for a strategic alliance to defeat the DP. The Kabaka was also promised the largely ceremonial position of Head of state of Uganda, which was of great symbolic importance to the Baganda.

This marriage of convenience between the UPC and the KY made inevitable the defeat of the DP interim administration. In the aftermath of the April 1962 final election leading up to independence, Uganda's national assembly consisted of forty-three UPC members, twenty-four KY members, and twenty-four DP members. The new UPC-KY coalition led Uganda into independence in October 1962, with Obote as prime minister, and the kabaka becoming president a year later.

{{History of Uganda}}

The '''British Protectorate of Uganda''' was a [[protectorate]] of the [[British Empire]] from 1894 to 1962. In 1893 the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] transferred its administration rights of territory consisting mainly of [[Buganda Kingdom]] to the British Government.

In 1894 the Uganda Protectorate was established, and the territory was extended beyond the borders of Buganda to an area that roughly corresponds to that of present-day [[Uganda]].

==Background==
===Civil war===
In the mid 1880s, the [[Kingdom of Buganda]] was divided between four religious factions - pagans, [[Catholics]], [[Protestants]] and [[Muslims]] - each vying for political control.<ref name=\"Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94\">Griffiths, Tudor. “Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94.” Journal of Religion in Africa, vol. 31, no. 1, 2001, pp. 92–114. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1581815.</ref>  In 1888, [[Mwanga II of Buganda|Mwanga II]] was ousted in a coup led by the Muslim faction, who installed [[Kalema of Buganda|Kalema]] as leader. The following year, a Protestant and Catholic coalition formed to remove Kalema and return [[Mwanga II of Buganda|Mwanga II]] to power. This coalition secured an alliance with the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]], and succeeded in ousting Kalema and reinstating Mwanga in 1890.<ref name=\"Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94\">Griffiths, Tudor. “Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94.” Journal of Religion in Africa, vol. 31, no. 1, 2001, pp. 92–114. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1581815.</ref>

The IBEAC sent [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Frederick Lugard]] to Bugunda in 1890 as its chief representative and to help maintain the peace between the competing factions. In 1891, Mwanga concluded a treaty with Lugard whereby Mwanga would place his land and tributary states under the protection of the IBEAC.<ref>Gray, John, and Carl Peters. “Anglo-German Relations in Uganda, 1890-1892.” The Journal of African History, vol. 1, no. 2, 1960, pp. 281–297.

On 31 March 1893, the IBEAC formally ended its involvement in Uganda.

On 18 June 1894, the British government declared that Uganda would come under British protection as a [[Protectorate]].

==British rule==
===1894–1901===
The [[Buganda Agreement (1900)|Uganda Agreement of 1900]] solidified the power of the largely Protestant 'Bakungu' client-chiefs, led by Kagwa. London sent only a few officials to administer the country, relying primarily on the 'Bakungu' chiefs. For decades they were preferred because of their political skills, their Christianity, their friendly relations with the British, their ability to collect taxes, and the proximity of Entebbe (the Ugandan capital) to the Buganda capital. By the 1920s the British administrators were more confident and had less need for military or administrative support. Colonial officials taxed cash crops produced by the peasants. There was popular discontent among the Baganda rank-and-file, which weakened the position of their leaders. In 1912 Kagwa moved to solidify 'Bakungu' power by proposing a second 'Lukiko' for Buganda with himself as president and the 'Bakungu' as a sort of hereditary aristocracy. British officials vetoed the idea when they discovered widespread popular opposition. Instead, British officials began some reforms and attempted to make the 'Lukiko' a genuine representative assembly.<ref>Michael Twaddle, \"The Bakungu chiefs of Buganda under British colonial rule, 1900–1930.\" ''Journal of African History'' 10#2 (1969): 309-322.</ref>

[[File:The White Elephant, Punch 103.png|thumb|''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon depicting Uganda personified as a [[White elephant]] which the [[Imperial British East Africa Company|East Africa Company]] is attempting to sell to Britain (1892)]]
Although momentous change occurred during the colonial era in [[Uganda]], some characteristics of late-nineteenth-century African society survived to reemerge at the time of independence. The status of [[Protectorate]] had significantly different consequences for Uganda than had the region been made a colony like neighboring [[Kenya]], insofar as Uganda retained a degree of self-government that would have otherwise been limited under a full colonial administration.

Colonial rule, however, affected local economic systems dramatically, in part because the first concern of the British was financial. Quelling the 1897 mutiny (see [[Uganda before 1900]]) had been costly—units of the [[British Indian Army]] had been transported to Uganda at considerable expense. The new commissioner of Uganda in 1900, Sir [[Harry H. Johnston]], had orders to establish an efficient administration and to levy taxes as quickly as possible. Johnston approached the chiefs in [[Buganda]] with offers of jobs in the colonial administration in return for their collaboration.

The chiefs, were more interested in preserving Buganda as a self-governing entity, continuing the royal line of [[Kabaka of Buganda|kabakas]], and securing private land tenure for themselves and their supporters. Hard bargaining ensued, but the chiefs ended up with everything they wanted, including one-half of all the land in Buganda. The half left to the British as \"Crown Land\" was later found to be largely swamp and scrub.

Johnston's [[Buganda Agreement of 1900]] imposed a tax on huts and guns, designated the chiefs as tax collectors, and testified to the continued alliance of British and Baganda interests. The British signed much less generous treaties with the other kingdoms ([[Toro (kingdom)|Toro]] in 1900, [[Ankole]] in 1901, and [[Bunyoro]] in 1933) without the provision of large-scale private land tenure. The smaller chiefdoms of [[Busoga]] were ignored.

=== Buganda administrators ===
The Baganda immediately offered their services to the British as administrators over their recently conquered neighbours, an offer which was attractive to the economy-minded colonial administration. Baganda agents fanned out as local tax collectors and labour organizers in areas such as [[Kigezi]], [[Mbale]], and, significantly, Bunyoro. This subimperialism and Ganda cultural chauvinism were resented by the people being administered.

Wherever they went, Baganda insisted on the exclusive use of their language, [[Luganda language|Luganda]], and they planted [[banana]]s as the only proper food worth eating. They regarded their traditional dress—long cotton gowns called [[kanzu]]s—as civilized; all else was barbarian. They also encouraged and engaged in mission work, attempting to convert locals to their form of Christianity or Islam. In some areas, the resulting backlash aided the efforts of religious rivals—for example, Catholics won converts in areas where oppressive rule was identified with a Protestant [[Muganda]] chief.

The people of [[Bunyoro]] were particularly aggrieved, having fought the Baganda and the British; having a substantial section of their heartland annexed to Buganda as the \"lost counties\", and finally having \"arrogant\" Baganda administrators issuing orders, collecting taxes, and forcing unpaid labour. In 1907 the Banyoro rose in a rebellion called ''nyangire'', or \"refusing\", and succeeded in having the Baganda subimperial agents withdrawn.

Meanwhile, in 1901 the completion of the [[Uganda Railway]] from the coast at [[Mombasa]] to the [[Lake Victoria]] port of [[Kisumu]] moved colonial authorities to encourage the growth of cash crops to help pay the railway's operating costs. Another result of the railway construction was the 1902 decision to transfer the eastern section of the Uganda Protectorate to the [[Kenya Colony]], then called the [[East Africa Protectorate]], to keep the entire line under one local colonial administration. Because the railway experienced cost overruns in Kenya, the British decided to justify its exceptional expense and pay its operating costs by introducing large-scale European settlement in a vast tract of land that became a centre of cash-crop agriculture known as the \"[[White Highlands]]\". A major part of the territory eventually left off of the \"East Africa Protectorate\" was the [[Uganda Scheme]], in which the British Empire offered to create a Jewish nation-state. The offer was made to the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist movement]] which rejected it, refusing to accept anything other than the ancient Land of Israel.

In many areas of Uganda, by contrast, agricultural production was placed in the hands of Africans, if they responded to the opportunity. Cotton was the crop of choice, largely because of pressure by the [[British Cotton Growing Association]], textile manufacturers who urged the colonies to provide raw materials for British mills. This was done by cash cropping the land. Even the [[Church Mission Society|CMS]] joined the effort by launching the [[Uganda Company]] (managed by a former missionary) to promote cotton planting and to buy and transport the produce.

Buganda, with its strategic location on the lakeside, reaped the benefits of cotton growing. The advantages of this crop were quickly recognized by the Baganda chiefs who had newly acquired freehold estates, which came to be known as [[mailo land]] because they were measured in square miles. In 1905 the initial baled cotton export was valued at £200; in 1906, £1,000; in 1907; £11,000; and in 1908, £52,000. By 1915 the value of cotton exports had climbed to £369,000, and Britain was able to end its subsidy of colonial administration in Uganda, while in Kenya the white settlers required continuing subsidies by the home government.

The income generated by cotton sales made the Buganda kingdom relatively prosperous, compared with the rest of colonial Uganda, although before [[World War I]] cotton was also being grown in the eastern regions of [[Busoga]], [[Lango sub-region|Lango]], and [[Teso sub-region|Teso]]. Many Baganda spent their new earnings on imported clothing, bicycles, metal roofing, and even cars. They also invested in their children's education. The Christian missions emphasized literacy skills, and African converts quickly learned to read and write. By 1911 two popular journals, ''Ebifa'' (News) and ''Munno'' (Your Friend), were published monthly in Luganda.

Heavily supported by African funds, new schools were soon turning out graduating classes at Mengo High School, St. Mary's Kisubi, Namilyango, Gayaza, and [[King's College Budo]] — all in Buganda. The chief minister of the Buganda kingdom, Sir [[Apolo Kaggwa]], personally awarded a bicycle to the top graduate at [[King's College Budo]], together with the promise of a government job. The schools, in fact, had inherited the educational function formerly performed in the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]]'s palace, where generations of young pages had been trained to become chiefs. Now the qualifications sought were literacy and skills, including typing and English translation.

Two important principles of precolonial political life carried over into the colonial era: clientage, whereby ambitious younger officeholders attached themselves to older high-ranking chiefs, and generational conflict, which resulted when the younger generation sought to expel their elders from office in order to replace them. After World War I, the younger aspirants to high office in Buganda became impatient with the seemingly perpetual tenure of Sir Apolo and his contemporaries, who lacked many of the skills that members of the younger generation had acquired through schooling. Calling themselves the [[Young Baganda Association]], members of the new generation attached themselves to the young kabaka, [[Daudi Chwa]], who was the figurehead ruler of Buganda under indirect rule. But Kabaka Daudi never gained real political power, and after a short and frustrating reign, he died at the relatively young age of forty-three.

===First World War era military forces===
Early on in the Protectorate's history of occupation the British colonial government had recognised the need for a local defence force.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lwanga-Luwyiigo|first1=Sanwiri|title=The Colonial Roots of Internal Conflict in Uganda|date=25 September 1987|issue=Makerere University|page=8|url=https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/123456789/1412/ISIC%2017-The%20colonial%20roots%20of%20internal%20conflict%20in%20Uganda%20-%20331408.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref> In 1895 the British colonial armed force in the Protectorate was the Uganda Rifles, who were formed as an internal security force (i.e. keeping the peace in tribal areas rather than defending against external aggression).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Omara-Otunnu|first1=Amii|title=Politics and the Military in Uganda, 1890–1985|date=1987|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781349187362|pages=19–21|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I9evCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=%22Uganda+Rifles%22#v=onepage|accessdate=13 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lwanga-Luwyiigo|first1=Sanwiri|title=The Colonial Roots of Internal Conflict in Uganda|date=25 September 1987|issue=Makerere University|page=7|url=https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/123456789/1412/ISIC%2017-The%20colonial%20roots%20of%20internal%20conflict%20in%20Uganda%20-%20331408.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref> In the late 19th Century the local defence force was largely composed of Sudanese troops brought in by the British, these troops were commanded by a mix of British and Sudanese officers, local tribes were not that evident in this force defending the interests of the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]].

Most of this recruitment was done from the northern part of the protectorate especially the Acholi sub-region. The British colonial administration had also fought with the Lamogi clan of the Acholi People in what that culminated in to the Lamogi Rebellion.

==1920 to 1961==
{{Uganda Protectorate imagemap}}
Far more promising as a source of political support were the British colonial officers, who welcomed the typing and translation skills of school graduates and advanced the careers of their favourites. The contest was decided after World War I, when an influx of British ex-military officers, now serving as district commissioners, began to feel that self-government was an obstacle to good government. Specifically, they accused Sir Apolo and his generation of inefficiency, abuse of power, and failure to keep adequate financial accounts—charges that were not hard to document.

Sir Apolo resigned in 1926, at about the same time that a host of elderly Baganda chiefs were replaced by a new generation of officeholders. The Buganda treasury was also audited that year for the first time. Although it was not a nationalist organization, the Young Baganda Association claimed to represent popular African dissatisfaction with the old order. As soon as the younger Baganda had replaced the older generation in office, however, their objections to privilege accompanying power ceased. The pattern persisted in Ugandan politics up to and after independence.

The commoners, who had been labouring on the cotton estates of the chiefs before World War I, did not remain servile. As time passed, they bought small parcels of land from their erstwhile landlords. This land fragmentation was aided by the British, who in 1927 forced the chiefs to limit severely the rents and obligatory labour they could demand from their tenants. Thus the oligarchy of landed chiefs who had emerged with the Buganda Agreement of 1900 declined in importance, and agricultural production shifted to independent smallholders, who grew cotton, and later coffee, for the export market.

Unlike [[Tanganyika]], which was devastated during the prolonged fighting between Britain and Germany in the [[East African Campaign of World War I]], Uganda prospered from wartime agricultural production. After the population losses from disease during the era of conquest and at the turn of the century (particularly the devastating [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] epidemic of 1900- 1906), Uganda's population was growing again. Even the 1930s depression seemed to affect smallholder cash farmers in Uganda less severely than it did the white settler producers in Kenya. Ugandans simply grew their own food until rising prices made export crops attractive again.

Two issues continued to create grievance through the 1930s and 1940s. The colonial government strictly regulated the buying and processing of cash crops, setting prices and reserving the role of intermediary for Asians, who were thought to be more efficient. The British and Asians firmly repelled African attempts to break into cotton ginning. In addition, on the Asian-owned sugar plantations established in the 1920s, labour for sugar-cane and other cash crops was increasingly provided by migrants from peripheral areas of Uganda and even from outside Uganda.

==Independence==
In 1949 discontented Baganda rioted and burned down the houses of pro-government chiefs. The rioters had three demands: the right to bypass government price controls on the export sales of cotton, the removal of the Asian monopoly over cotton ginning, and the right to have their own representatives in local government replace chiefs appointed by the British. They were critical as well of the young kabaka, [[Mutesa II|Frederick Walugembe Mutesa II]] (also known as \"King Freddie\" or \"Kabaka Freddie\"), for his inattention to the needs of his people. The British governor, Sir [[John Hall (colonial administrator)|John Hall]], regarded the riots as the work of communist-inspired agitators and rejected the suggested reforms.

[[File:BEA-KUT 1958 MiNr0094I pm B002.jpg|thumb|200px|Stamp of British East Africa with a portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]]]
Far from leading the people into confrontation, Uganda's would-be agitators were slow to respond to popular discontent. Nevertheless, the [[Uganda African Farmers Union]], founded by [[I.K. Musazi]] in 1947, was blamed for the riots and was banned by the British. Musazi's [[Uganda National Congress]] replaced the farmers union in 1952 when it was set up with [[Abu Mayanja]] as its first Secretary General, but because the congress remained a casual discussion group more than an organized political party, it stagnated and came to an end just two years after its inception.

Meanwhile, the British began to move ahead of the Ugandans in preparing for independence. The effects of Britain's postwar withdrawal from [[India]], the march of nationalism in [[West Africa]], and a more liberal philosophy in the [[Colonial Office]] geared toward future self-rule all began to be felt in Uganda. The embodiment of these issues arrived in 1952 in the person of a new and energetic reformist governor, [[Andrew Cohen (statesman)|Sir Andrew Cohen]] (formerly undersecretary for African affairs in the Colonial Office).

Cohen set about preparing Uganda for independence. On the economic side, he removed obstacles to African cotton ginning, rescinded price discrimination against African-grown coffee, encouraged cooperatives, and established the [[Uganda Development Corporation]] to promote and finance new projects. On the political side, he reorganized the Legislative Council, which had consisted of an unrepresentative selection of interest groups heavily favouring the European community, to include African representatives elected from districts throughout Uganda. This system became a prototype for the future parliament.

===Power politics in Buganda===
The prospect of elections caused a sudden proliferation of new political parties. This development alarmed the old-guard leaders within the Uganda kingdoms, because they realized that the centre of power would be at the national level. The spark that ignited wider opposition to Governor Cohen's reforms was a 1953 speech in London in which the secretary of state for colonies referred to the possibility of a federation of the three East African territories (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika), similar to that established in central Africa.

Many Ugandans were aware of the [[Central African Federation]] of [[Rhodesia]] and [[Nyasaland]] (later [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]], and [[Malawi]]) and its domination by white settler interests. Ugandans deeply feared the prospect of an East African federation dominated by the settlers of Kenya, which was then in the midst of the bitter [[Mau Mau]] uprising. They had vigorously resisted a similar suggestion by the 1930 [[Hilton Young Commission]]. Confidence in Cohen vanished just as the governor was preparing to urge Buganda to recognize that its special status would have to be sacrificed in the interests of a new and larger nation-state.

Mutesa II, who had been regarded by his subjects as uninterested in their welfare, now refused to cooperate with Cohen's plan for an integrated Buganda. Instead, he demanded that Buganda be separated from the rest of the protectorate and transferred to Foreign Office jurisdiction. Cohen's response to this crisis was to deport the kabaka to a comfortable exile in London. His forced departure made the kabaka an instant martyr in the eyes of the Baganda, whose latent separatism and anticolonial sentiments set off a storm of protest. Cohen's action had backfired, and he could find no one among the Baganda prepared or able to mobilize support for his schemes. After two frustrating years of unrelenting Ganda hostility and obstruction, Cohen was forced to reinstate [[Kabaka Freddie]].

The negotiations leading to the kabaka's return had an outcome similar to the negotiations of Commissioner Johnston in 1900; although appearing to satisfy the British, they were a resounding victory for the Baganda. Cohen secured the kabaka's agreement not to oppose independence within the larger Uganda framework. Not only was the kabaka reinstated in return, but for the first time since 1889, the monarch was given the power to appoint and dismiss his chiefs (Buganda government officials) instead of acting as a mere figurehead while they conducted the affairs of government.

The kabaka's new power was cloaked in the misleading claim that he would be only a \"constitutional monarch\", while in fact he was a leading player in deciding how Uganda would be governed. A new grouping of Baganda calling themselves \"the King's Friends\" rallied to the kabaka's defence. They were conservative, fiercely loyal to Buganda as a kingdom, and willing to entertain the prospect of participation in an independent Uganda only if it were headed by the kabaka. Baganda politicians who did not share this vision or who were opposed to the \"King's Friends\" found themselves branded as the \"King's Enemies\", which meant political and social ostracism.

The major exception to this rule were the Roman Catholic Baganda who had formed their own party, the [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party]] (DP), led by [[Benedicto Kiwanuka]]. Many Catholics had felt excluded from the Protestant-dominated establishment in Buganda ever since Lugard's Maxim had turned the tide in 1892. The kabaka had to be Protestant, and he was invested in a coronation ceremony modelled on that of British monarchs (who are invested by the Church of England's Archbishop of Canterbury) that took place at the main Protestant church. Religion and politics were equally inseparable in the other kingdoms throughout Uganda. The DP had Catholic as well as other adherents and was probably the best organized of all the parties preparing for elections. It had printing presses and the backing of the popular newspaper, Munno, which was published at the St. Mary's Kisubi mission.

Elsewhere in Uganda, the emergence of the kabaka as a political force provoked immediate hostility. Political parties and local interest groups were riddled with divisions and rivalries, but they shared one concern: they were determined not to be dominated by Buganda. In 1960 a political organizer from Lango, [[Milton Obote]], seized the initiative and formed a new party, the [[Uganda People's Congress]] (UPC), as a coalition of all those outside the Roman Catholic-dominated DP who opposed Buganda hegemony.

The steps Cohen had initiated to bring about the independence of a unified Uganda state had led to a polarization between factions from Buganda and those opposed to its domination. Buganda's population in 1959 was 2 million, out of Uganda's total of 6 million. Even discounting the many non-Baganda resident in Buganda, there were at least 1 million people who owed allegiance to the kabaka—too many to be overlooked or shunted aside, but too few to dominate the country as a whole.

At the London Conference of 1960, it was obvious that Buganda autonomy and a strong unitary government were incompatible, but no compromise emerged, and the decision on the form of government was postponed. The British announced that elections would be held in March 1961 for \"responsible government\", the next-to-last stage of preparation before the formal granting of independence. It was assumed that those winning the election would gain valuable experience in office, preparing them for the probable responsibility of governing after independence.

In Buganda the \"King's Friends\" urged a total boycott of the election because their attempts to secure promises of future autonomy had been rebuffed. Consequently, when the voters went to the polls throughout Uganda to elect eighty-two [[National Assembly of Uganda|National Assembly]] members, in Buganda only the Roman Catholic supporters of the DP braved severe public pressure and voted, capturing twenty of Buganda's twenty-one allotted seats. This artificial situation gave the DP a majority of seats, although they had a minority of 416,000 votes nationwide versus 495,000 for the UPC. Benedicto Kiwanuka became the new chief minister of Uganda.

Shocked by the results, the Baganda separatists, who formed a political party called [[Kabaka Yekka]], had second thoughts about the wisdom of their election boycott. They quickly welcomed the recommendations of a British commission that proposed a future federal form of government. According to these recommendations, Buganda would enjoy a measure of internal autonomy if it participated fully in the national government.

For its part, the UPC was equally anxious to eject its DP rivals from government before they became entrenched. Obote reached an understanding with Kabaka Freddie and the KY, accepting Buganda's special federal relationship and even a provision by which the kabaka could appoint Buganda's representatives to the National Assembly, in return for a strategic alliance to defeat the DP. The Kabaka was also promised the largely ceremonial position of Head of state of Uganda, which was of great symbolic importance to the Baganda.

This marriage of convenience between the UPC and the KY made inevitable the defeat of the DP interim administration. In the aftermath of the April 1962 final election leading up to independence, Uganda's national assembly consisted of forty-three UPC members, twenty-four KY members, and twenty-four DP members. The new UPC-KY coalition led Uganda into independence in October 1962, with Obote as prime minister, and the kabaka becoming president a year later.

The fourth season of the [[police procedural]] drama ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' was originally broadcast between September 19, 2006 and May 22, 2007. Special Agent [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs|Gibbs]] left NCIS at the end of season three after a terrorist attack had been successful because his superiors did not heed his warnings in time. The team is now led by [[Anthony DiNozzo|DiNozzo]] for a short time until Gibbs' eventual return. New characters introduced in this season are [[Michelle Lee (NCIS)|Michelle Lee]], who was briefly on DiNozzo's team and was transferred to the legal department upon Gibbs' return, and (already in the final episodes of season 3) Gibbs' former boss and mentor [[Mike Franks (NCIS)|Mike Franks]], both as recurring characters. Also, albeit later in the season, [[U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command|Army CID]] Lieutenant Colonel [[Hollis Mann]] is introduced as another love interest for Gibbs.

In December 2006, Bill Keveney from ''[[USA Today]]'' announced that the \"CBS investigative drama ''NCIS'' topped the Nielsen viewership list for the first time with 17.4 million. CBS was the No. 1 network in viewers and young adults (ages 18 to 49) for the week of Dec. 11–17.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Keveney|first=Bill|title='NCIS' gets rerun assist|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-12-20-nielsen-analysis_x.htm?hiddenMacValue=0&hiddenMacPrintValue=0|work=USA Today|accessdate=June 3, 2013|date=December 20, 2006}}</ref>

 |ShortSummary   = The team is forced to attend a sexual harassment seminar but much to their relief, Gibbs receives a call that a Navy officer is found dead in a classified self-driven robotic vehicle she was working on developing for a potential [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] contractor. Although it initially looks like suicide, when Abby puts the vehicle through some tests, it nearly takes her life as well but thanks to Gibbs' efforts, she is saved from certain death although McGee is left guilt-ridden over what happened. They discover that someone rigged the vehicle to kill the passenger and make it appear to be suicide but the woman who was killed was not the intended target. While Gibbs is questioning the scientists involved in the contract, the vehicle \"escapes\" from the garage and it is up to Abby and McGee to stop it from killing more people. Meanwhile, Tony visits the hospital to see his girlfriend and continues working on special projects for the Director. Ziva notices Tony getting calls from the hospital and begins worrying about his health.

Hamilton County is part of the [[Indianapolis]]-[[Carmel, Indiana|Carmel]]-[[Anderson, Indiana|Anderson]], IN [[Indianapolis metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Since the beginning of the 21st century, Hamilton County has been the second most populous county in Central Indiana.

Hamilton County's roots are in agriculture. However, after [[World War II]], Indianapolis grew north and towns in the southern part of the county developed as [[suburbs]]. Residential and commercial development have replaced many farm fields. The northern part of the county remains largely agricultural. Today, the county is one of the fastest-growing counties in the [[United States]]. According to 2007 estimates by the U.S. Census, the county's population increased from an estimated 182,740 in 2000 to 261,661 in 2007, making it the fastest-growing county in Indiana out of 92. Recently{{when|date=June 2018}}, Hamilton County surpassed [[St. Joseph County, Indiana|St. Joseph County]] in population, making it the state's fourth most populous.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hamilton takes top spot in county headcount |url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008803210423 |work=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=2008-03-21 |accessdate=2008-03-21 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> It is also the third densest in the state, after Marion and Lake Counties.

In 2010, Hamilton County was home to three of the state's 20 largest cities and towns: [[Carmel, Indiana|Carmel]] (8th), [[Fishers, Indiana|Fishers]] (9th), and [[Noblesville]] (14th).

[[Geist Reservoir|Geist]] and Morse reservoirs are two man-made lakes in Hamilton County that offer recreational opportunities such as boating, fishing, and waterfront living.

In June 2008, Hamilton County was named America's Best Place to Raise a Family by Forbes.com<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/06/27/schools-places-family-forbeslife-cx_zg_0630realestate_slide_21.html?thisSpeed=30000 | work=Forbes | title=In Depth: America's Best Places To Raise A Family - Forbes.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191448/http://www.forbes.com/2008/06/27/schools-places-family-forbeslife-cx_zg_0630realestate_slide_21.html?thisSpeed=30000|archivedate=2016-03-03 }}</ref> due to its strong economy, affordable living, top-ranked schools, and close proximity to Indianapolis.

==History==
The land containing Hamilton County was brought into the possession of the United States by the [[Treaty of St. Mary's]] in 1818. [[William Conner]] was the first white settler in the county. In the summer of 1822, after realizing there were enough settlers in the area, Conner and other settlers applied to the Indiana Legislature for a charter authorizing them to become a separate and independent county under Indiana law. The application was presented to the Legislature at the 1822-23 session and the act was passed and approved by the governor on January 8, 1823. The act took effect on the first Monday in April (April 7), 1823. The County Commissioners first met on May 5, 1823, at the house of [[William Conner]]. Conner's house would also serve as the County Circuit Court. The county was named after [[Alexander Hamilton]], the first secretary of the treasury.<ref>{{cite web| title=Hamilton County stats| publisher=Indiana.edu| url=http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/pr18057.html| accessdate=2007-06-30| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708012823/http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/pr18057.html| archivedate=2007-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

=== Politics ===
The county is located in [[Indiana's 5th congressional district]], which is represented by [[Susan Brooks]].

Hamilton County has been won by every [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate since [[Charles Evans Hughes]] in 1916. In 1912, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Woodrow Wilson]] had carried the county with a 3.06% plurality over Republican opponent [[William Taft]].<ref name=\"uselectionatlas.org\">[http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 David Leip's Presidential Atlas (Maps for Indiana by election)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081130204636/http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 |date=2008-11-30 }} Results prior to 1960 available through subscription only</ref>

Hamilton County's loyalty to the Republican Party is not limited to presidential elections. The county regularly rejects Democrats in [[Governor of Indiana|gubernatorial]] and [[United States Senate|senatorial]] races, and is typically one of the Republicans' strongest counties at the state level. One of the few times in recent memory that Hamilton County has supported a Democrat for governor or Senate was in 1992, when [[Evan Bayh]] narrowly carried it with 50.48 percent of the vote in his successful reelection bid.  However, Bayh lost Hamilton County in his three bids for Senate.

Despite these facts, however, the county is slowly tilting more Democratic like many suburban counties. [[Donald Trump]] in 2016 gave the weakest showing for a Republican nominee  since [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1932, despite his statewide dominance that year, winning just 56% of the vote. Thus, Hamilton County voted less Republican than the rest of the state for the first time in almost 100 years, even though Trump still carried the county. Eight years earlier, [[Barack Obama]] received 38.45% of the county vote during the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]], the strongest result for a Democrat since [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1936. [[Joe Donnelly]] in his 2018 senate re-election loss also came less than 10% away from winning the county, winning 44.4% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Election Results 2018 |url=https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/indiana/ |website=Politico}}</ref>

Hamilton County is part of the [[Indianapolis]]-[[Carmel, Indiana|Carmel]]-[[Anderson, Indiana|Anderson]], IN [[Indianapolis metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Since the beginning of the 21st century, Hamilton County has been the second most populous county in Central Indiana.

Hamilton County's roots are in agriculture. However, after [[World War II]], Indianapolis grew north and towns in the southern part of the county developed as [[suburbs]]. Residential and commercial development have replaced many farm fields. The northern part of the county remains largely agricultural. Today, the county is one of the fastest-growing counties in the [[United States]]. According to 2007 estimates by the U.S. Census, the county's population increased from an estimated 182,740 in 2000 to 261,661 in 2007, making it the fastest-growing county in Indiana out of 92. Recently{{when|date=June 2018}}, Hamilton County surpassed [[St. Joseph County, Indiana|St. Joseph County]] in population, making it the state's fourth most populous.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hamilton takes top spot in county headcount |url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008803210423 |work=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=2008-03-21 |accessdate=2008-03-21 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> It is also the third densest in the state, after Marion and Lake Counties.

In 2010, Hamilton County was home to three of the state's 20 largest cities and towns: [[Carmel, Indiana|Carmel]] (8th), [[Fishers, Indiana|Fishers]] (9th), and [[Noblesville]] (14th).

[[Geist Reservoir|Geist]] and Morse reservoirs are two man-made lakes in Hamilton County that offer recreational opportunities such as boating, fishing, and waterfront living.

In June 2008, Hamilton County was named America's Best Place to Raise a Family by Forbes.com<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/06/27/schools-places-family-forbeslife-cx_zg_0630realestate_slide_21.html?thisSpeed=30000 | work=Forbes | title=In Depth: America's Best Places To Raise A Family - Forbes.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191448/http://www.forbes.com/2008/06/27/schools-places-family-forbeslife-cx_zg_0630realestate_slide_21.html?thisSpeed=30000|archivedate=2016-03-03 }}</ref> due to its strong economy, affordable living, top-ranked schools, and close proximity to Indianapolis.

==History==
The land containing Hamilton County was brought into the possession of the United States by the [[Treaty of St. Mary's]] in 1818. [[William Conner]] was the first white settler in the county. In the summer of 1822, after realizing there were enough settlers in the area, Conner and other settlers applied to the Indiana Legislature for a charter authorizing them to become a separate and independent county under Indiana law. The application was presented to the Legislature at the 1822-23 session and the act was passed and approved by the governor on January 8, 1823. The act took effect on the first Monday in April (April 7), 1823. The County Commissioners first met on May 5, 1823, at the house of [[William Conner]]. Conner's house would also serve as the County Circuit Court. The county was named after [[Alexander Hamilton]], the first secretary of the treasury.<ref>{{cite web| title=Hamilton County stats| publisher=Indiana.edu| url=http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/pr18057.html| accessdate=2007-06-30| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708012823/http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/pr18057.html| archivedate=2007-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

=== Politics ===
The county is located in [[Indiana's 5th congressional district]], which is represented by [[Susan Brooks]].

Hamilton County has been won by every [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate since [[Charles Evans Hughes]] in 1916. In 1912, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Woodrow Wilson]] had carried the county with a 3.06% plurality over Republican opponent [[William Taft]].<ref name=\"uselectionatlas.org\">[http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 David Leip's Presidential Atlas (Maps for Indiana by election)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081130204636/http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 |date=2008-11-30 }} Results prior to 1960 available through subscription only</ref>

Hamilton County's loyalty to the Republican Party is not limited to presidential elections. The county regularly rejects Democrats in [[Governor of Indiana|gubernatorial]] and [[United States Senate|senatorial]] races, and is typically one of the Republicans' strongest counties at the state level. One of the few times in recent memory that Hamilton County has supported a Democrat for governor or Senate was in 1992, when [[Evan Bayh]] narrowly carried it with 50.48 percent of the vote in his successful reelection bid.  However, Bayh lost Hamilton County in his three bids for Senate.

Despite these facts, however, the county is slowly tilting more Democratic like many suburban counties. [[Donald Trump]] in 2016 gave the weakest showing for a Republican nominee  since [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1932, despite his statewide dominance that year, winning just 56% of the vote. Thus, Hamilton County voted less Republican than the rest of the state for the first time in almost 100 years, even though Trump still carried the county. Eight years earlier, [[Barack Obama]] received 38.45% of the county vote during the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]], the strongest result for a Democrat since [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1936. [[Joe Donnelly]] in his 2018 senate re-election loss also came less than 10% away from winning the county, winning 44.4% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Election Results 2018 |url=https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/indiana/ |website=Politico}}</ref>

\"'''No Scrubs'''\" is a song recorded by American [[girl group]] [[TLC (group)|TLC]] for their third studio album ''[[FanMail]]'' (1999). The lyrics posit that a man who does not have his own car is a \"scrub\" (also known as a \"buster\") and is undesirable as a romantic or sexual partner. [[LaFace Records]] and [[Arista Records]] released it as the album's [[lead single]] on February 2, 1999. The song was written by [[Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs]] alongside former [[Xscape (group)|Xscape]] members, [[Kandi Burruss]] and [[Tameka Cottle|Tameka \"Tiny\" Cottle]]. The [[single version]] containing self-written rap by [[Lisa Lopes|Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes]] was not included on the album ''FanMail'', and later appeared in a slightly shorter edit on ''[[Now and Forever: The Hits]]'' and ''[[20 (TLC album)|20]]''. \"No Scrubs\" was the first time [[Rozonda Thomas|Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas]] took the sole [[lead vocals]] on any TLC single. The album version of the song won [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group]] and [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] at [[42nd Annual Grammy Awards]].

\"No Scrubs\" met with international success. It became TLC's third number-one single and eighth top 10 single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It also earned them their second Grammy Award nomination for [[Record of the Year]]. \"No Scrubs\" is one of TLC's [[signature song]]s and was the second-biggest Hot 100 single of 1999 in the U.S., only behind [[Cher]]'s \"[[Believe (Cher song)|Believe]]\", according to ''Billboard''{{'}}s year-end charts. On the decade end chart for 1990–99, \"No Scrubs\" was ranked at number 33. The single was certified Platinum in the UK and Platinum in New Zealand.

==Background==
The song was initially written by [[Kandi Burruss]] on an old envelope while sitting in her car, in which she \"freestyled the entire song while just driving down a highway: the verse, hook, pre-chorus, the whole thing.\"<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> The song was initially meant for Burruss and [[Tameka Cottle]] to record together, however [[Dallas Austin]] decided to give the song to [[TLC (group)|TLC]] as their first single for ''[[FanMail]]'', with [[Rozonda Thomas|Chilli]] singing the lead vocals.<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> Austin further emphasized that the song was a breakthrough for Chilli, as he felt that \"It was a great way to expose her; being a secondary vocalist was not just her purpose.\"<ref name=\"FanMail20\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8499567/tlc-fanmail-interview-20th-anniversary-dallas-austin|title=TLC's 'FanMail' Turns 20: A Track-By-Track Retrospective With the Girl Group and Behind-the-Scenes Collaborators|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Gracie|first=Bianca|date=February 22, 2019|access-date=October 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223013401/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8499567/tlc-fanmail-interview-20th-anniversary-dallas-austin|archive-date=February 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Music video==
===Background===
The [[Hype Williams]]-directed video was set in a futuristic space station, where the trio wore silver and blue metallic outfits.<ref name=\"VibeFanMail\"/> It includes a dance sequence where the women dance in front of the \"TLC\" logo. The Main Mix is used in the video in place of the album version, which includes a rap verse by [[Lisa Lopes|Left Eye]]. [[Tionne Watkins|T-Boz]] described how the group went all out during production of the video, with her being specifically excited about \"wearing the all-white outfit\", while [[Rozonda Thomas|Chilli]] initially felt apprehensive about going on the swing, constantly practicing before the shoot until she did not want to get off afterwards.<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> The scene at the end of the video showing the three fighting each other and being silly was a result of the tube moving and the group attempting to fight against the moving set, with Chilli and Left Eye hitting each other by accident.<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> American [[drag queen]] [[RuPaul]] also appeared off-camera to see them.<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> The video is stylistically similar to [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Janet Jackson]]'s music video, \"[[Scream/Childhood|Scream]]\", as well as the [[Busta Rhymes]] and Janet Jackson music video, \"[[What's It Gonna Be?!]]\", which was also directed by Williams.<ref name=\"VibeNoScrubs\"/>

===Synopsis===
The video features the women in three different colored space-suits: white, black, silver, and Left Eye in blue. When there are shots of the women together they have two different outfits: black and silver. T-Boz's hair is fuchsia in the video. It also features a scene of Chilli on a swing singing, alongside T-Boz dancing as well as Left Eye. As Left Eye's rap begins, she is positioned in a garage wearing white clothes while rapping, and practicing martial arts in a futuristic blue outfit in a separate scene.<ref name=\"VibeFanMail\"/> She is filmed by a drone, as she continues rapping; \"Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me/You as clear as DVD on digital TV screens.\"<ref name=\"VibeFanMail\"/> The final scene shows TLC fighting each other, while also dancing and having fun.

===Reception===
The futuristic music video received massive airplay on [[MTV]] and [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} It also won the group the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video]] at the [[1999 MTV Video Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1999/mtvvmas.htm|title=1999 MTV Video Music Awards|website=Rock on the Net|access-date=January 22, 2020}}</ref> As of March 2020, the video has over 200 million views on [[YouTube]].

\"'''No Scrubs'''\" is a song recorded by American [[girl group]] [[TLC (group)|TLC]] for their third studio album ''[[FanMail]]'' (1999). The lyrics posit that a man who does not have his own car is a \"scrub\" (also known as a \"buster\") and is undesirable as a romantic or sexual partner. [[LaFace Records]] and [[Arista Records]] released it as the album's [[lead single]] on February 2, 1999. The song was written by [[Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs]] alongside former [[Xscape (group)|Xscape]] members, [[Kandi Burruss]] and [[Tameka Cottle|Tameka \"Tiny\" Cottle]]. The [[single version]] containing self-written rap by [[Lisa Lopes|Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes]] was not included on the album ''FanMail'', and later appeared in a slightly shorter edit on ''[[Now and Forever: The Hits]]'' and ''[[20 (TLC album)|20]]''. \"No Scrubs\" was the first time [[Rozonda Thomas|Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas]] took the sole [[lead vocals]] on any TLC single. The album version of the song won [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group]] and [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] at [[42nd Annual Grammy Awards]].

\"No Scrubs\" met with international success. It became TLC's third number-one single and eighth top 10 single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It also earned them their second Grammy Award nomination for [[Record of the Year]]. \"No Scrubs\" is one of TLC's [[signature song]]s and was the second-biggest Hot 100 single of 1999 in the U.S., only behind [[Cher]]'s \"[[Believe (Cher song)|Believe]]\", according to ''Billboard''{{'}}s year-end charts. On the decade end chart for 1990–99, \"No Scrubs\" was ranked at number 33. The single was certified Platinum in the UK and Platinum in New Zealand.

==Background==
The song was initially written by [[Kandi Burruss]] on an old envelope while sitting in her car, in which she \"freestyled the entire song while just driving down a highway: the verse, hook, pre-chorus, the whole thing.\"<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> The song was initially meant for Burruss and [[Tameka Cottle]] to record together, however [[Dallas Austin]] decided to give the song to [[TLC (group)|TLC]] as their first single for ''[[FanMail]]'', with [[Rozonda Thomas|Chilli]] singing the lead vocals.<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> Austin further emphasized that the song was a breakthrough for Chilli, as he felt that \"It was a great way to expose her; being a secondary vocalist was not just her purpose.\"<ref name=\"FanMail20\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8499567/tlc-fanmail-interview-20th-anniversary-dallas-austin|title=TLC's 'FanMail' Turns 20: A Track-By-Track Retrospective With the Girl Group and Behind-the-Scenes Collaborators|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Gracie|first=Bianca|date=February 22, 2019|access-date=October 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223013401/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8499567/tlc-fanmail-interview-20th-anniversary-dallas-austin|archive-date=February 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Music video==
===Background===
The [[Hype Williams]]-directed video was set in a futuristic space station, where the trio wore silver and blue metallic outfits.<ref name=\"VibeFanMail\"/> It includes a dance sequence where the women dance in front of the \"TLC\" logo. The Main Mix is used in the video in place of the album version, which includes a rap verse by [[Lisa Lopes|Left Eye]]. [[Tionne Watkins|T-Boz]] described how the group went all out during production of the video, with her being specifically excited about \"wearing the all-white outfit\", while [[Rozonda Thomas|Chilli]] initially felt apprehensive about going on the swing, constantly practicing before the shoot until she did not want to get off afterwards.<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> The scene at the end of the video showing the three fighting each other and being silly was a result of the tube moving and the group attempting to fight against the moving set, with Chilli and Left Eye hitting each other by accident.<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> American [[drag queen]] [[RuPaul]] also appeared off-camera to see them.<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> The video is stylistically similar to [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Janet Jackson]]'s music video, \"[[Scream/Childhood|Scream]]\", as well as the [[Busta Rhymes]] and Janet Jackson music video, \"[[What's It Gonna Be?!]]\", which was also directed by Williams.<ref name=\"VibeNoScrubs\"/>

===Synopsis===
The video features the women in three different colored space-suits: white, black, silver, and Left Eye in blue. When there are shots of the women together they have two different outfits: black and silver. T-Boz's hair is fuchsia in the video. It also features a scene of Chilli on a swing singing, alongside T-Boz dancing as well as Left Eye. As Left Eye's rap begins, she is positioned in a garage wearing white clothes while rapping, and practicing martial arts in a futuristic blue outfit in a separate scene.<ref name=\"VibeFanMail\"/> She is filmed by a drone, as she continues rapping; \"Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me/You as clear as DVD on digital TV screens.\"<ref name=\"VibeFanMail\"/> The final scene shows TLC fighting each other, while also dancing and having fun.

===Reception===
The futuristic music video received massive airplay on [[MTV]] and [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} It also won the group the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video]] at the [[1999 MTV Video Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1999/mtvvmas.htm|title=1999 MTV Video Music Awards|website=Rock on the Net|access-date=January 22, 2020}}</ref> As of March 2020, the video has over 200 million views on [[YouTube]].

It is administered by the Manawatū-Whanganui Regional Council, which operates under the name '''Horizons Regional Council'''. 

== Name ==
In recent years both the [[Whanganui River]] and [[Whanganui District]] were renamed to reflect the correct spelling in [[Māori language|Māori]], but the region was spelled without an \"h\". Horizons councillors narrowly voted against adding an 'h' and spelling Manawatū with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] in 2015,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/74878146/Regional-council-debates-the-h-in-Whanganui|title=Regional council debates the 'h' in Whanganui|last=McBride|first=Nicholas|date=8 December 2015|work=Manawatu Standard|access-date=9 October 2016|via=Stuff.co.nz}}</ref> but in 2018 the Regional Council agreed to add both 'h' and macron, and made this recommendation to the [[New Zealand Geographic Board]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/360056/regional-council-votes-to-add-h-to-wanganui|title=Regional council votes to add 'h' to Wanganui|last=Martin|first=Robin|date=20 June 2018|website=Radio New Zealand|language=en-nz|access-date=2019-01-31}}</ref> The NZGB agreed in September to accept the proposal, and requested public submissions for one month, ending in December 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linz.govt.nz/regulatory/place-names/place-name-consultation/15702|title=Manawatū-Whanganui Region|date=September 2018|website=Land Information New Zealand Toitū te Whenua|access-date=31 January 2019}}</ref> In September 2019 they announced that from 18 October the name of the Manawatu-Wanganui region, and the regional council, would be corrected to incorporate both the letter \"h\" and the macron.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.linz.govt.nz/news/2019-09/manawat%C5%AB-whanganui-region-spelling-corrected|title=Manawatū-Whanganui Region spelling corrected|last=|first=|date=23 September 2019|website=Land Information New Zealand (LINZ)|language=en-NZ|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref> This became the official spelling of the name on 18 October, although the Manawatū-Whanganui Regional Council would continue to use the trading name of Horizons Regional Council.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/116057100/official-name-change-for-manawatwhanganui-region-gets-a-macron-and-an-extra-letter|title=Official name change for Manawatū-Whanganui region gets a macron and an extra letter|last=|first=|date=24 September 2019|work=Stuff|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref> 

The name {{lang|mi|Manawatū}} is a compound word that originates in an old Māori [[Māori music#Waiata|waiata]] (song) that describes the search by an early ancestor, Haunui-a-Nanaia, for his wife. He named various waterways in the district. The waiata {{lang|mi|\"Ka tatū e hine ko Manawatū\"}} describes how his heart ({{lang|mi|manawa}}) settled or momentarily stopped ({{lang|mi|tatū}}) when he saw the Manawatu River.<ref name=\":0\" />

== Government ==
The region covers all or part of ten [[territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authority]] areas. Parts of five of these are covered by five other [[regions of New Zealand]], the most of any region. In descending order of land area the territorial authority districts are [[Ruapehu District|Ruapehu]], the major parts of [[Tararua District]] and [[Rangitikei District|Rangitikei]], [[Manawatu District|Manawatū]], [[Whanganui District|Whanganui]], [[Horowhenua District|Horowhenua]], and small parts of [[Stratford, New Zealand|Stratford]], [[Waitomo District|Waitomo]], and [[Taupo District|Taupo]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/NZTerritorialAuthorities.png|title=Map |website=upload.wikimedia.org}}</ref> The largest city is [[Palmerston North]], with a population of 85,300 (June 2012 estimate). It is the only territorial authority in the region to be administered by a city council.

The governing body of the regional council consists of 12 councillors from 6 constituencies across the region, elected by the public; from the north: Ruapehu (1 councillor), Whanganui (2), Manawatu-Rangitikei (2), Palmerston North (4), Horowhenua-Kairanga (2), Tararua District (1). It sits in Palmerston North. It has the responsibility for managing natural and physical resources, providing flood protection and monitoring environmental problems and fresh air, clean water, productive land and natural eco-systems. It is also responsible for public transport.

==Geography==
The region is dominated and defined by two significant river catchments, the [[Whanganui River|Whanganui]] and the [[Manawatu River|Manawatu]]. The Whanganui River, in the northwest, is the longest navigable river in New Zealand. The river was extremely important to early [[Māori people|Māori]] as it was the southern link in a chain of waterways that spanned almost two-thirds of the North Island. It was one of the chief areas of Māori settlement with its easily fortified cliffs and ample food supplies. Legends emphasise the importance of the river and it remains sacred to Whanganui [[iwi]]. Māori along the coast and lowland plains grew [[Sweet potato|kumara]] and other crops. The Manawatu River runs across the centre of the region, from rolling hill country in the east to the fertile [[Manawatu Plains]] in the west. The main city of [[Palmerston North]] is located on these plains, and is an important service city for the southern North Island as a whole. This river is unusual, in that it passes from hill country to plains through a gorge cut into much higher country, an indication that the hills have risen since the river formed.

To the southeast, a further, more sparsely populated area of the [[Tararua District]] lies between the sources of the [[Manawatu River]] near [[Norsewood]] and the Pacific coast. This area, often historically connected with both the [[Hawke's Bay region]] to the north and the [[Wairarapa]] to the south, was historically simply known as Bush, a name which still survives in some businesses and organisations, most notably the [[Wairarapa-Bush Rugby Football Union]].

The two river catchments have very different natures. While the open Manawatu Plains became more densely settled by Europeans, inland [[Ruapehu District|Ruapehu]], [[Rangitikei (district), New Zealand|Rangitikei]] and [[Whanganui District|Whanganui]] remained more Māori-dominated, remote and independent, and is still heavily forested. As late as the 1950s the Whanganui River remained a river of mystery. Since then exploitation of the river's commercial potential has opened up the area, often causing friction with local Māori, who have long-standing grievances. Manawatū-Whanganui as a whole is one of the most important pastoral areas in New Zealand, its status recognised when the government opened the [[Massey University|Massey Agricultural College]] in the 1920s.

Much of Manawatu-Wanganui was fertile and [[forest|bush]]-covered when Europeans arrived and developed the area as a source of [[timber]]. [[Saw mill]]ing and [[flax]] [[Mill (factory)|milling]] dominated the 19th century, followed by an influx of [[sheep]] farmers who exploited the newly cleared ground. [[Deforestation]], burn-offs of timber and scrub and large scale drainage combined with [[overgrazing]], resulted in considerable environmental degradation. In the early 1900s authorities realised that careful management was needed to maintain this important [[agriculture|agricultural]] area.

===Topography===
Manawatū-Whanganui takes up a large proportion of the lower half of the North Island. It is the second-largest local government region in the North Island and the sixth-largest in New Zealand, totalling 22,215&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (8.1% of New Zealand's land area). The region stretches from north of Taumarunui to south of Levin on the west coast, and across to the east coast from [[Cape Turnagain]] to Owhanga. It borders the [[Waikato]], [[Taranaki]], [[Hawke's Bay (region)|Hawke's Bay]] and [[Wellington (region)|Wellington]] regions and includes river catchment areas that run from the [[volcanic plateau]] to the sea. The [[Pacific Ocean]] is the eastern boundary and the [[Ruahine Ranges]] form a natural boundary with Hawke's Bay.

The area includes a variety of landscape formations. Districts close to the [[North Island Volcanic Plateau|Volcanic Plateau]] are higher and more rugged, often subject to harsh temperatures in winter. The [[Manawatu (district)|Manawatu District]] has a much gentler topography, consisting mainly of the flat, tree-studded [[Manawatu Plains]] that run between the ranges and the sea. The land was under the sea till about 500,000 years ago and still has a very thick layer of marine sediment, which is about five or six million years old. A [[block fault]]ing system underneath the thick sediment has raised a series of domes and gentle depressions. These structures can provide natural storage areas for oil and some of the Manawatu domes have been drilled. The domes have shaped the course of the Manawatu River, giving it a meandering path which, uniquely among New Zealand rivers, begins close to the east coast and exits on the west coast. The Manawatu River begins just inside the Hawke's Bay region, then flows through a deep gorge to the Manawatu Plains before exiting in the [[Tasman Sea]]. The river is also unique in New Zealand (and rare worldwide) in that this gorge (the [[Manawatu Gorge]]) is a [[water gap]] through recently uplifted rock, causing the river to flow from relatively low-lying land along an eroded course through higher terrain. The [[Whanganui District]] is more rugged, with [[canyon]]-like valleys and gorges carved out of the soft rock by rivers and ocean waves.

The region includes a series of mountain ranges, notably the [[Tararua Range]] and the [[Ruahine Ranges|Ruahine Range]] and the three major active [[volcano]]es of the North Island. [[Mount Ruapehu]] at 2,797 m is the tallest mountain in the North Island, [[Mount Ngauruhoe|Ngauruhoe]] 2,291 m and [[Mount Tongariro|Tongariro]] 1,968 m. During the last 100 years Ruapehu has experienced six significant eruptions, and last erupted in 1995 and 1996.

Three major rivers divide the region: the Whanganui (290&nbsp;km), Manawatū (182&nbsp;km) and [[Rangitikei River|Rangitikei]] (241&nbsp;km). The Whanganui is the second-longest river and has the second-largest catchment in the North Island, draining most of the inland region west of [[Lake Taupo]]. There are few roads in this area, which contains some of the largest surviving areas of native bush in the North Island.

===Soil and climate===
Soils are productive with the addition of [[fertiliser]]. In the Manawatū and [[Horowhenua]] Districts there are sandy soils and swampy hollows around the coast with [[loess]]-covered terraces and river flats inland. These river flats and swamp areas contain fertile [[alluvial]] and organic soils. On the drier terraces inland yellow-grey earths predominate. The flatter more fertile soils suit intensive sheep farming and cropping while the hill country of Rangitikei favours semi-intensive sheep and [[beef]] farming. Areas close to the volcanic plateau consist largely of [[pumice]] soils which lack some essential trace elements but within the region much of this land is occupied by national parks.

The region has a comparatively mild climate with greater climatic extremes inland. [[Chateau Tongariro]] experienced the lowest temperature recorded in the North Island, falling to -13.6&nbsp;°C on 7 July 1937. In summer the region is warm, with a maximum mid-summer daily average of between 20.1 and 22.9&nbsp;°C. Sunshine hours approximate the national average for much of the region (1,800-2,000 hours per annum) but Palmerston North is defined as cloudy with an average of 1,725 sunshine hours. In the winter the minimum mid-winter daily average for coastal areas is 4.0 to 7.9&nbsp;°C, while inland areas are considerably colder. [[Waiouru]] has a minimum mid-winter daily average of 0.1&nbsp;°C.

Rainfall on the plains is slightly below average, with Palmerston North receiving 960&nbsp;mm, while the rest of the region receives the New Zealand average rainfall of 1,000-2,000&nbsp;mm.

===Conservation and parks===
The region contains areas of great ecological significance, reflected in the designation of approximately a seventh of its land area as part of the nation's conservation estate. [[Tongariro National Park]] is the largest park in the region (795.98&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and is the oldest national park in the country, established in 1887. The volcanoes Tongariro, Ruapehu and Ngauruhoe are sacred to Māori and were given to the nation by [[Te Heuheu Tukino IV]], paramount chief of [[Ngati Tuwharetoa]]. They form the nucleus of the park, which is designated a [[world heritage]] area.

[[Whanganui National Park]] is slightly smaller (742.31&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and was established 99 years later when a series of reserves were incorporated into one area and given national park status. There are two state forest parks in the rugged, bush-clad Ruahine Range and Tararua Range. The four parks offer [[skiing]], [[tramping]], [[jetboat]]ing and white-water [[rafting]] and the opportunity to appreciate the environment.

The regional council, responsible for managing natural and physical resources, provides flood protection and monitors environmental problems such as pest infestation and pollution. Invasive plant pests such as [[African feathergrass]], [[Galega officinalis|goats rue]] and nodding [[thistle]] pose a threat to pastureland in this heavily agricultural-dependent region, and the council has instituted control campaigns. The council has also instituted animal pest control programmes. [[Common brushtail possum|Possums]] are perceived as the major animal pest since they damage native forests and endanger cattle production through the spread of bovine [[tuberculosis]]. Eradication programmes also concentrate on [[rabbit]]s, [[Rook (bird)|rook]]s and feral [[goat]]s, while other exotic species such as [[Parma wallaby]] (''Macropus parma''),{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} [[wasp]]s, [[ferret]]s, [[stoat]]s and [[weasel]]s are a source of concern.

===Biodiversity===
The internationally recognised [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] estuarine wetlands site at [[Foxton Beach]] is of note as having one of the most diverse ranges of wetlands birds to be seen at any one place in New Zealand. A total of 95 species have been identified at the estuary. It is a significant area of salt marsh and mudflat and a valuable feeding ground for many birds including the migratory Eastern bar-tailed Godwit, which flies all the way from Siberia to New Zealand to escape the harsh northern winter. The estuary is also a permanent home to 13 species of birds, six species of fish and four plants species, all of which are threatened. It regularly supports about one percent of the world population of wrybills.<ref name=\"doc.govt.nz\">{{cite web |title=Manawatu Estuary |url=https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/manawatu-whanganui/places/manawatu-estuary |website=doc.govt.nz |publisher=New Zealand Department of Conservation |language=en-nz}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]]  Text was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].</ref>

==People==
[[File:ManawatuWanganuiRegionPopulationDensity.png|thumb|right|280px| Population density in Manawatū-Whanganui at the 2006 census]]

The region had a usually resident population of 222,672 people at the 2013 census, the sixth-largest population in New Zealand. Between the 2006 and 2013 censuses the population rose by 249, which is less than one percent.<ref>{{NZ Quickstats2013|14181|Manawatu-Wanganui Region}}</ref>

There are two major urban areas. [[Palmerston North]], with a resident population of {{NZ population data 2018|Palmerston North|y}} ({{NZ population data 2018|}|y}} estimate), expanded as an educational centre and a supply centre for the surrounding rural hinterland. It became a city in 1930. The other major urban area is [[Whanganui]], with an estimated resident population of {{NZ population data 2018|Whanganui|y|y|y|as of |.}} Other urban centres include [[Levin, New Zealand|Levin]], [[Feilding]], [[Dannevirke]], [[Taumarunui]], [[Foxton, New Zealand|Foxton]], and [[Marton, New Zealand|Marton]]. The region also includes the smaller towns of Bulls, Ohakune, Waiouru, Raetihi, Taihape, Woodville, Pahiatua, Eketahuna, Ashhurst, Foxton Beach, Turakina, Sanson, Shannon and Manakau.

City life does not dominate, as half the population live outside a large urban area, over a third in small towns or rural areas. While [[manufacturing]] has become an important part of the economy, most businesses are agriculturally based and agriculture remains the linchpin. The dominance of agriculture, combined with the relatively small scale of most urban areas, gives a rural quality to the region, quite distinct from the neighbouring [[Wellington Region]]. The rugged interior has become one of the main training areas for the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], which maintain three bases in the region: [[RNZAF Base Ohakea]], [[Linton Military Camp]], and [[Waiouru Military Camp]].

==History==
* Pre-1769 Approximately 3% of Māori lived in the Whanganui Basin and 8% on the [[Taranaki]] coast. Coastal Māori garden and gather food but life for Māori further inland is more difficult, relying on hunting and gathering.
* 1820–40 [[Ngati Toa|Ngāti Toa]] and [[Te Atiawa]] [[iwi]] displace local iwi from their lands.
* 1830 [[Te Rauparaha]] (Ngati Toa) lay siege to Pūtiki [[Pā (Māori)|Pā]] in retaliation for an attack on [[Kapiti Island]], sacking the pā and killing its inhabitants.

==Economy==
The sub-national GDP of Manawatū-Whanganui was estimated at US$5.594 billion in 2003, 4% of New Zealand's national GDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/reports/analytical-reports/regional-gross-domestic-product.aspx|title=Regional Gross Domestic Product|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|year=2007|accessdate=18 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520133128/http://www.stats.govt.nz/reports/analytical-reports/regional-gross-domestic-product.aspx|archive-date=20 May 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Business===
Agriculture dominates the economy. A higher than average proportion of businesses were engaged in the [[agriculture]], [[forestry]] and [[fishing]] industries, 6.3% compared with 4.4% nationally. Businesses engaged in retail trade were dominant numerically. In 1997 there were 2,300 businesses, employing a total of 10,380 full-time
equivalents (FTEs). The percentage of businesses engaged in manufacturing was slightly higher than the national average and manufacturing employed the greatest number of people (12,830 FTEs).

===Energy===
Unlike its neighbour [[Taranaki]], Manawatū-Whanganui has not been a major producer of energy or minerals. Some new power schemes are operating, including the southern hemisphere's largest collection<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windenergy.org.nz|title=NZWEA Home Page|website=www.windenergy.org.nz}}</ref> of [[wind farm]]s, with 194 installed turbines and more planned.

===Agriculture===
The region is known for its strong agricultural base, which prompted the establishment of an agricultural college there in the 1920s. The government wanted to promote scientific farming and established colleges in two of the most important farming areas, [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] and the Manawatū. Research by members of the college into animal genetics in the 1930s led to the development of new breeds of sheep, the [[Drysdale (sheep)|Drysdale]] and the [[Perendale]], which became commercially significant after World War II.

Agriculture dominates land use although there are areas of forestry and [[horticulture]]. Soils and climate favour pastoral farming. There were 6,344 farm holdings on 30 June 1996, which was almost a tenth of all farm holdings in New Zealand. Farming occupied 72.5% of land, which was much higher than the national average of 60.1%. Approximately 80% of this land was used for agricultural purposes (grazing, arable, fodder and fallow land). In the Manawatū, Rangitikei and Tararua Districts this percentage rose to over 90% of total land.

The region is one of the most important areas of pastoral farming in New Zealand. It had 7,216,177 sheep (at 30 June 1996), the largest number of sheep in the North Island and the fourth-highest figure in the country behind Canterbury, [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] and [[Otago]]. [[Barley]], which is used for the manufacture of stock feed and for malting, is grown. The region produces the largest quantities of barley in the North Island, providing 10% of the national refined crop of 302,804 tonnes in 1995. The region also produces a significant proportion of vegetables in New Zealand. By planted land area, the region produces 25% of the country's [[lettuce]], 23% percent of its [[asparagus]], and 19% of its [[broccoli]], [[cabbage]] and [[cauliflower]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freshfacts.co.nz/files/freshfacts-2018.pdf|title=Fresh Facts: New Zealand Horticulture|date=2018|website=Plant & Food Research|issn=1177-2190}}</ref>

===Forestry===
The region is one of the most significant forestry areas in the southern North Island. The predominant soil type, yellow-brown earths, when enhanced by the use of fertilisers, is very suitable for forestry. Forestry has a long history in the Manawatū since Palmerston North developed as a saw-milling town, and the region's initial prosperity depended on heavy exploitation of native timbers. But land use practices inhibited the long term viability of this indigenous forestry industry. Severe burn-offs destroyed large areas of native forest and subsequent overgrazing affected the soils. Forestry largely disappeared until the early twentieth century. In an attempt to combat erosion problems in sandy soils the government planted forests in the Foxton/Levin area in the early twentieth century. Inland forests were planted later. Some private native forest has been set aside for sustainable logging but most forestry depends on exotic plantings.

===Tourism===
For the eight quarters between September 1996 and June 1998 the region averaged 4.1% of total guest nights in New Zealand. This was close behind Wellington at 6.7% and greater than Hawke's Bay, which averaged 3.1%. Occupancy rates, at 20.1%, were the fourth-lowest in the country for the June 1998 quarter. Rates for the city of Palmerston North were significantly higher than the national average (39.5% compared with 25.8%) whereas districts such as Ruapehu are far more seasonal with fairly low occupancy rates except in the peak ski season.

===Transport===
[[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]], the main highway, and the [[North Island Main Trunk]] railway, which both link [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]], run through the region. The [[Palmerston North–Gisborne Line]] and [[New Zealand State Highway 3|State Highway 3]] follow the [[Manawatu Gorge]], linking the region with Hawke's Bay. The [[Marton–New Plymouth Line]] provides a railway link with Taranaki, and from this line the short [[Wanganui Branch]] runs to Whanganui. Road and rail transport give the region's exporters easy access to ports.

The region has approximately 16% of the North Island's road length. There are 8,732&nbsp;km of road, of which two-thirds are sealed. Approximately 12% of roads are classified as urban and three-quarters as rural, with almost half of the rural roads being unsealed. With 945.9&nbsp;km the region has the second-highest length of state highways in the North Island, after Waikato.

It is administered by the Manawatū-Whanganui Regional Council, which operates under the name '''Horizons Regional Council'''. 

== Name ==
In recent years both the [[Whanganui River]] and [[Whanganui District]] were renamed to reflect the correct spelling in [[Māori language|Māori]], but the region was spelled without an \"h\". Horizons councillors narrowly voted against adding an 'h' and spelling Manawatū with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] in 2015,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/74878146/Regional-council-debates-the-h-in-Whanganui|title=Regional council debates the 'h' in Whanganui|last=McBride|first=Nicholas|date=8 December 2015|work=Manawatu Standard|access-date=9 October 2016|via=Stuff.co.nz}}</ref> but in 2018 the Regional Council agreed to add both 'h' and macron, and made this recommendation to the [[New Zealand Geographic Board]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/360056/regional-council-votes-to-add-h-to-wanganui|title=Regional council votes to add 'h' to Wanganui|last=Martin|first=Robin|date=20 June 2018|website=Radio New Zealand|language=en-nz|access-date=2019-01-31}}</ref> The NZGB agreed in September to accept the proposal, and requested public submissions for one month, ending in December 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linz.govt.nz/regulatory/place-names/place-name-consultation/15702|title=Manawatū-Whanganui Region|date=September 2018|website=Land Information New Zealand Toitū te Whenua|access-date=31 January 2019}}</ref> In September 2019 they announced that from 18 October the name of the Manawatu-Wanganui region, and the regional council, would be corrected to incorporate both the letter \"h\" and the macron.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.linz.govt.nz/news/2019-09/manawat%C5%AB-whanganui-region-spelling-corrected|title=Manawatū-Whanganui Region spelling corrected|last=|first=|date=23 September 2019|website=Land Information New Zealand (LINZ)|language=en-NZ|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref> This became the official spelling of the name on 18 October, although the Manawatū-Whanganui Regional Council would continue to use the trading name of Horizons Regional Council.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/116057100/official-name-change-for-manawatwhanganui-region-gets-a-macron-and-an-extra-letter|title=Official name change for Manawatū-Whanganui region gets a macron and an extra letter|last=|first=|date=24 September 2019|work=Stuff|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref> 

The name {{lang|mi|Manawatū}} is a compound word that originates in an old Māori [[Māori music#Waiata|waiata]] (song) that describes the search by an early ancestor, Haunui-a-Nanaia, for his wife. He named various waterways in the district. The waiata {{lang|mi|\"Ka tatū e hine ko Manawatū\"}} describes how his heart ({{lang|mi|manawa}}) settled or momentarily stopped ({{lang|mi|tatū}}) when he saw the Manawatu River.<ref name=\":0\" />

== Government ==
The region covers all or part of ten [[territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authority]] areas. Parts of five of these are covered by five other [[regions of New Zealand]], the most of any region. In descending order of land area the territorial authority districts are [[Ruapehu District|Ruapehu]], the major parts of [[Tararua District]] and [[Rangitikei District|Rangitikei]], [[Manawatu District|Manawatū]], [[Whanganui District|Whanganui]], [[Horowhenua District|Horowhenua]], and small parts of [[Stratford, New Zealand|Stratford]], [[Waitomo District|Waitomo]], and [[Taupo District|Taupo]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/NZTerritorialAuthorities.png|title=Map |website=upload.wikimedia.org}}</ref> The largest city is [[Palmerston North]], with a population of 85,300 (June 2012 estimate). It is the only territorial authority in the region to be administered by a city council.

The governing body of the regional council consists of 12 councillors from 6 constituencies across the region, elected by the public; from the north: Ruapehu (1 councillor), Whanganui (2), Manawatu-Rangitikei (2), Palmerston North (4), Horowhenua-Kairanga (2), Tararua District (1). It sits in Palmerston North. It has the responsibility for managing natural and physical resources, providing flood protection and monitoring environmental problems and fresh air, clean water, productive land and natural eco-systems. It is also responsible for public transport.

==Geography==
The region is dominated and defined by two significant river catchments, the [[Whanganui River|Whanganui]] and the [[Manawatu River|Manawatu]]. The Whanganui River, in the northwest, is the longest navigable river in New Zealand. The river was extremely important to early [[Māori people|Māori]] as it was the southern link in a chain of waterways that spanned almost two-thirds of the North Island. It was one of the chief areas of Māori settlement with its easily fortified cliffs and ample food supplies. Legends emphasise the importance of the river and it remains sacred to Whanganui [[iwi]]. Māori along the coast and lowland plains grew [[Sweet potato|kumara]] and other crops. The Manawatu River runs across the centre of the region, from rolling hill country in the east to the fertile [[Manawatu Plains]] in the west. The main city of [[Palmerston North]] is located on these plains, and is an important service city for the southern North Island as a whole. This river is unusual, in that it passes from hill country to plains through a gorge cut into much higher country, an indication that the hills have risen since the river formed.

To the southeast, a further, more sparsely populated area of the [[Tararua District]] lies between the sources of the [[Manawatu River]] near [[Norsewood]] and the Pacific coast. This area, often historically connected with both the [[Hawke's Bay region]] to the north and the [[Wairarapa]] to the south, was historically simply known as Bush, a name which still survives in some businesses and organisations, most notably the [[Wairarapa-Bush Rugby Football Union]].

The two river catchments have very different natures. While the open Manawatu Plains became more densely settled by Europeans, inland [[Ruapehu District|Ruapehu]], [[Rangitikei (district), New Zealand|Rangitikei]] and [[Whanganui District|Whanganui]] remained more Māori-dominated, remote and independent, and is still heavily forested. As late as the 1950s the Whanganui River remained a river of mystery. Since then exploitation of the river's commercial potential has opened up the area, often causing friction with local Māori, who have long-standing grievances. Manawatū-Whanganui as a whole is one of the most important pastoral areas in New Zealand, its status recognised when the government opened the [[Massey University|Massey Agricultural College]] in the 1920s.

Much of Manawatu-Wanganui was fertile and [[forest|bush]]-covered when Europeans arrived and developed the area as a source of [[timber]]. [[Saw mill]]ing and [[flax]] [[Mill (factory)|milling]] dominated the 19th century, followed by an influx of [[sheep]] farmers who exploited the newly cleared ground. [[Deforestation]], burn-offs of timber and scrub and large scale drainage combined with [[overgrazing]], resulted in considerable environmental degradation. In the early 1900s authorities realised that careful management was needed to maintain this important [[agriculture|agricultural]] area.

===Topography===
Manawatū-Whanganui takes up a large proportion of the lower half of the North Island. It is the second-largest local government region in the North Island and the sixth-largest in New Zealand, totalling 22,215&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (8.1% of New Zealand's land area). The region stretches from north of Taumarunui to south of Levin on the west coast, and across to the east coast from [[Cape Turnagain]] to Owhanga. It borders the [[Waikato]], [[Taranaki]], [[Hawke's Bay (region)|Hawke's Bay]] and [[Wellington (region)|Wellington]] regions and includes river catchment areas that run from the [[volcanic plateau]] to the sea. The [[Pacific Ocean]] is the eastern boundary and the [[Ruahine Ranges]] form a natural boundary with Hawke's Bay.

The area includes a variety of landscape formations. Districts close to the [[North Island Volcanic Plateau|Volcanic Plateau]] are higher and more rugged, often subject to harsh temperatures in winter. The [[Manawatu (district)|Manawatu District]] has a much gentler topography, consisting mainly of the flat, tree-studded [[Manawatu Plains]] that run between the ranges and the sea. The land was under the sea till about 500,000 years ago and still has a very thick layer of marine sediment, which is about five or six million years old. A [[block fault]]ing system underneath the thick sediment has raised a series of domes and gentle depressions. These structures can provide natural storage areas for oil and some of the Manawatu domes have been drilled. The domes have shaped the course of the Manawatu River, giving it a meandering path which, uniquely among New Zealand rivers, begins close to the east coast and exits on the west coast. The Manawatu River begins just inside the Hawke's Bay region, then flows through a deep gorge to the Manawatu Plains before exiting in the [[Tasman Sea]]. The river is also unique in New Zealand (and rare worldwide) in that this gorge (the [[Manawatu Gorge]]) is a [[water gap]] through recently uplifted rock, causing the river to flow from relatively low-lying land along an eroded course through higher terrain. The [[Whanganui District]] is more rugged, with [[canyon]]-like valleys and gorges carved out of the soft rock by rivers and ocean waves.

The region includes a series of mountain ranges, notably the [[Tararua Range]] and the [[Ruahine Ranges|Ruahine Range]] and the three major active [[volcano]]es of the North Island. [[Mount Ruapehu]] at 2,797 m is the tallest mountain in the North Island, [[Mount Ngauruhoe|Ngauruhoe]] 2,291 m and [[Mount Tongariro|Tongariro]] 1,968 m. During the last 100 years Ruapehu has experienced six significant eruptions, and last erupted in 1995 and 1996.

Three major rivers divide the region: the Whanganui (290&nbsp;km), Manawatū (182&nbsp;km) and [[Rangitikei River|Rangitikei]] (241&nbsp;km). The Whanganui is the second-longest river and has the second-largest catchment in the North Island, draining most of the inland region west of [[Lake Taupo]]. There are few roads in this area, which contains some of the largest surviving areas of native bush in the North Island.

===Soil and climate===
Soils are productive with the addition of [[fertiliser]]. In the Manawatū and [[Horowhenua]] Districts there are sandy soils and swampy hollows around the coast with [[loess]]-covered terraces and river flats inland. These river flats and swamp areas contain fertile [[alluvial]] and organic soils. On the drier terraces inland yellow-grey earths predominate. The flatter more fertile soils suit intensive sheep farming and cropping while the hill country of Rangitikei favours semi-intensive sheep and [[beef]] farming. Areas close to the volcanic plateau consist largely of [[pumice]] soils which lack some essential trace elements but within the region much of this land is occupied by national parks.

The region has a comparatively mild climate with greater climatic extremes inland. [[Chateau Tongariro]] experienced the lowest temperature recorded in the North Island, falling to -13.6&nbsp;°C on 7 July 1937. In summer the region is warm, with a maximum mid-summer daily average of between 20.1 and 22.9&nbsp;°C. Sunshine hours approximate the national average for much of the region (1,800-2,000 hours per annum) but Palmerston North is defined as cloudy with an average of 1,725 sunshine hours. In the winter the minimum mid-winter daily average for coastal areas is 4.0 to 7.9&nbsp;°C, while inland areas are considerably colder. [[Waiouru]] has a minimum mid-winter daily average of 0.1&nbsp;°C.

Rainfall on the plains is slightly below average, with Palmerston North receiving 960&nbsp;mm, while the rest of the region receives the New Zealand average rainfall of 1,000-2,000&nbsp;mm.

===Conservation and parks===
The region contains areas of great ecological significance, reflected in the designation of approximately a seventh of its land area as part of the nation's conservation estate. [[Tongariro National Park]] is the largest park in the region (795.98&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and is the oldest national park in the country, established in 1887. The volcanoes Tongariro, Ruapehu and Ngauruhoe are sacred to Māori and were given to the nation by [[Te Heuheu Tukino IV]], paramount chief of [[Ngati Tuwharetoa]]. They form the nucleus of the park, which is designated a [[world heritage]] area.

[[Whanganui National Park]] is slightly smaller (742.31&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and was established 99 years later when a series of reserves were incorporated into one area and given national park status. There are two state forest parks in the rugged, bush-clad Ruahine Range and Tararua Range. The four parks offer [[skiing]], [[tramping]], [[jetboat]]ing and white-water [[rafting]] and the opportunity to appreciate the environment.

The regional council, responsible for managing natural and physical resources, provides flood protection and monitors environmental problems such as pest infestation and pollution. Invasive plant pests such as [[African feathergrass]], [[Galega officinalis|goats rue]] and nodding [[thistle]] pose a threat to pastureland in this heavily agricultural-dependent region, and the council has instituted control campaigns. The council has also instituted animal pest control programmes. [[Common brushtail possum|Possums]] are perceived as the major animal pest since they damage native forests and endanger cattle production through the spread of bovine [[tuberculosis]]. Eradication programmes also concentrate on [[rabbit]]s, [[Rook (bird)|rook]]s and feral [[goat]]s, while other exotic species such as [[Parma wallaby]] (''Macropus parma''),{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} [[wasp]]s, [[ferret]]s, [[stoat]]s and [[weasel]]s are a source of concern.

==People==
[[File:ManawatuWanganuiRegionPopulationDensity.png|thumb|right|280px| Population density in Manawatū-Whanganui at the 2006 census]]

The region had a usually resident population of 222,672 people at the 2013 census, the sixth-largest population in New Zealand. Between the 2006 and 2013 censuses the population rose by 249, which is less than one percent.<ref>{{NZ Quickstats2013|14181|Manawatu-Wanganui Region}}</ref>

There are two major urban areas. [[Palmerston North]], with a resident population of {{NZ population data 2018|Palmerston North|y}} ({{NZ population data 2018|}|y}} estimate), expanded as an educational centre and a supply centre for the surrounding rural hinterland. It became a city in 1930. The other major urban area is [[Whanganui]], with an estimated resident population of {{NZ population data 2018|Whanganui|y|y|y|as of |.}} Other urban centres include [[Levin, New Zealand|Levin]], [[Feilding]], [[Dannevirke]], [[Taumarunui]], [[Foxton, New Zealand|Foxton]], and [[Marton, New Zealand|Marton]]. The region also includes the smaller towns of Bulls, Ohakune, Waiouru, Raetihi, Taihape, Woodville, Pahiatua, Eketahuna, Ashhurst, Foxton Beach, Turakina, Sanson, Shannon and Manakau.

City life does not dominate, as half the population live outside a large urban area, over a third in small towns or rural areas. While [[manufacturing]] has become an important part of the economy, most businesses are agriculturally based and agriculture remains the linchpin. The dominance of agriculture, combined with the relatively small scale of most urban areas, gives a rural quality to the region, quite distinct from the neighbouring [[Wellington Region]]. The rugged interior has become one of the main training areas for the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], which maintain three bases in the region: [[RNZAF Base Ohakea]], [[Linton Military Camp]], and [[Waiouru Military Camp]].

==History==
* Pre-1769 Approximately 3% of Māori lived in the Whanganui Basin and 8% on the [[Taranaki]] coast. Coastal Māori garden and gather food but life for Māori further inland is more difficult, relying on hunting and gathering.
* 1820–40 [[Ngati Toa|Ngāti Toa]] and [[Te Atiawa]] [[iwi]] displace local iwi from their lands.
* 1830 [[Te Rauparaha]] (Ngati Toa) lay siege to Pūtiki [[Pā (Māori)|Pā]] in retaliation for an attack on [[Kapiti Island]], sacking the pā and killing its inhabitants.

==Economy==
The sub-national GDP of Manawatū-Whanganui was estimated at US$5.594 billion in 2003, 4% of New Zealand's national GDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/reports/analytical-reports/regional-gross-domestic-product.aspx|title=Regional Gross Domestic Product|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|year=2007|accessdate=18 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520133128/http://www.stats.govt.nz/reports/analytical-reports/regional-gross-domestic-product.aspx|archive-date=20 May 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Business===
Agriculture dominates the economy. A higher than average proportion of businesses were engaged in the [[agriculture]], [[forestry]] and [[fishing]] industries, 6.3% compared with 4.4% nationally. Businesses engaged in retail trade were dominant numerically. In 1997 there were 2,300 businesses, employing a total of 10,380 full-time
equivalents (FTEs). The percentage of businesses engaged in manufacturing was slightly higher than the national average and manufacturing employed the greatest number of people (12,830 FTEs).

===Energy===
Unlike its neighbour [[Taranaki]], Manawatū-Whanganui has not been a major producer of energy or minerals. Some new power schemes are operating, including the southern hemisphere's largest collection<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windenergy.org.nz|title=NZWEA Home Page|website=www.windenergy.org.nz}}</ref> of [[wind farm]]s, with 194 installed turbines and more planned.

===Agriculture===
The region is known for its strong agricultural base, which prompted the establishment of an agricultural college there in the 1920s. The government wanted to promote scientific farming and established colleges in two of the most important farming areas, [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] and the Manawatū. Research by members of the college into animal genetics in the 1930s led to the development of new breeds of sheep, the [[Drysdale (sheep)|Drysdale]] and the [[Perendale]], which became commercially significant after World War II.

Agriculture dominates land use although there are areas of forestry and [[horticulture]]. Soils and climate favour pastoral farming. There were 6,344 farm holdings on 30 June 1996, which was almost a tenth of all farm holdings in New Zealand. Farming occupied 72.5% of land, which was much higher than the national average of 60.1%. Approximately 80% of this land was used for agricultural purposes (grazing, arable, fodder and fallow land). In the Manawatū, Rangitikei and Tararua Districts this percentage rose to over 90% of total land.

The region is one of the most important areas of pastoral farming in New Zealand. It had 7,216,177 sheep (at 30 June 1996), the largest number of sheep in the North Island and the fourth-highest figure in the country behind Canterbury, [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] and [[Otago]]. [[Barley]], which is used for the manufacture of stock feed and for malting, is grown. The region produces the largest quantities of barley in the North Island, providing 10% of the national refined crop of 302,804 tonnes in 1995. The region also produces a significant proportion of vegetables in New Zealand. By planted land area, the region produces 25% of the country's [[lettuce]], 23% percent of its [[asparagus]], and 19% of its [[broccoli]], [[cabbage]] and [[cauliflower]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freshfacts.co.nz/files/freshfacts-2018.pdf|title=Fresh Facts: New Zealand Horticulture|date=2018|website=Plant & Food Research|issn=1177-2190}}</ref>

===Forestry===
The region is one of the most significant forestry areas in the southern North Island. The predominant soil type, yellow-brown earths, when enhanced by the use of fertilisers, is very suitable for forestry. Forestry has a long history in the Manawatū since Palmerston North developed as a saw-milling town, and the region's initial prosperity depended on heavy exploitation of native timbers. But land use practices inhibited the long term viability of this indigenous forestry industry. Severe burn-offs destroyed large areas of native forest and subsequent overgrazing affected the soils. Forestry largely disappeared until the early twentieth century. In an attempt to combat erosion problems in sandy soils the government planted forests in the Foxton/Levin area in the early twentieth century. Inland forests were planted later. Some private native forest has been set aside for sustainable logging but most forestry depends on exotic plantings.

===Tourism===
For the eight quarters between September 1996 and June 1998 the region averaged 4.1% of total guest nights in New Zealand. This was close behind Wellington at 6.7% and greater than Hawke's Bay, which averaged 3.1%. Occupancy rates, at 20.1%, were the fourth-lowest in the country for the June 1998 quarter. Rates for the city of Palmerston North were significantly higher than the national average (39.5% compared with 25.8%) whereas districts such as Ruapehu are far more seasonal with fairly low occupancy rates except in the peak ski season.

===Transport===
[[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]], the main highway, and the [[North Island Main Trunk]] railway, which both link [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]], run through the region. The [[Palmerston North–Gisborne Line]] and [[New Zealand State Highway 3|State Highway 3]] follow the [[Manawatu Gorge]], linking the region with Hawke's Bay. The [[Marton–New Plymouth Line]] provides a railway link with Taranaki, and from this line the short [[Wanganui Branch]] runs to Whanganui. Road and rail transport give the region's exporters easy access to ports.

The region has approximately 16% of the North Island's road length. There are 8,732&nbsp;km of road, of which two-thirds are sealed. Approximately 12% of roads are classified as urban and three-quarters as rural, with almost half of the rural roads being unsealed. With 945.9&nbsp;km the region has the second-highest length of state highways in the North Island, after Waikato.

→‎Self-conscious emotions,safe,Lcscnc,"In [[psychology of art]], the relationship between '''art and emotion''' has newly been the subject of extensive study thanks to the intervention of esteemed art historian [[Alexander Nemerov]]. [[Emotion]]al or aesthetic responses to [[art]] have previously been viewed as basic stimulus response, but new theories and research have suggested that these experiences are more complex and able to be studied experimentally.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Emotional Responses to Art: From Collation and Arousal to Cognition and Emotion.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2005|volume=9|issue=4|pages=342–357|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.9.4.342|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/Emotional%20Responses%20to%20Art.pdf}}</ref> Emotional responses are often regarded as the keystone to experiencing art, and the creation of an emotional experience has been argued as the purpose of artistic expression.<ref name=Fellous-review>{{cite journal|last=Fellous|first=Jean-Marc|title=A mechanistic view of the expression and experience of emotion in the arts. Deeper that reason: Emotion and its role in literature, music and art by Jenefer Robinson|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|year=2006|volume=119|issue=4|pages=668–674|doi=10.2307/20445371|jstor=20445371}}</ref> Research has shown that the neurological underpinnings of perceiving art differ from those used in standard object recognition.<ref name=Cupchick-neuro>{{cite journal|last=Cupchik|first=Gerald C.|author2=Vartanian, Oshin|author3= Crawley, Adrian|author4= Mikulis, David J.|title=Viewing artworks: Contributions of cognitive control and perceptual facilitation to aesthetic experience|journal=Brain and Cognition|date=1 June 2009|volume=70|issue=1|pages=84–91|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2009.01.003|pmid=19223099}}</ref>  Instead, [[brain]] regions involved in the experience of emotion and goal setting show activation when viewing art.<ref name=Cupchick-neuro />

== Basis for emotional responses to art ==
Evolutionary ancestry has hard-wired humans to have affective responses for certain patterns and traits. These predispositions lend themselves to responses when looking at certain visual arts as well. Identification of subject matter is the first step in understanding the visual image. Being presented with visual stimuli creates initial confusion. Being able to comprehend a figure and background creates closure and triggers the pleasure centers of the brain by remedying the confusion. Once an image is identified, meaning can be created by accessing memory relative to the visual stimuli and associating personal memories with what is being viewed.<ref name=\"barry\">{{cite journal | last1 = Barry | first1 = A | year = 2006 | title = Perceptual Aesthetics: Transcendent Emotion, Neurological Image | url = | journal = Visual Communication Quarterly | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 134–151 | doi = 10.1207/s15551407vcq1303_2 }}</ref>

Other methods of stimulating initial interest that can lead to emotion involves pattern recognition. [[Symmetry]] is often found in works of art, and the human brain unconsciously searches for symmetry for a number of reasons. Potential predators were [[Symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]], as were potential prey. Bilateral symmetry also exists in humans, and a healthy human is typically relatively symmetrical. This attraction to symmetry was therefore advantageous, as it helped humans recognize danger, food, and mates. Art containing symmetry therefore is typically approached and positively valenced to humans.<ref name=\"barry\" />

Another example is to observe paintings or photographs of bright, open landscapes that often evoke a feeling of beauty, [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], or happiness. This connection to pleasant emotions exists because it was advantageous to humans before today's society to be able to see far into the distance in a brightly lit vista. Similarly, visual images that are dark and/or obscure typically elicit emotions of [[anxiety]] and fear. This is because an impeded visual field is disadvantageous for a human to be able to defend itself.<ref name=\"carroll\">{{cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = N | title = Art and Mood | year = 2003 | url = | journal = Monist | volume = 86 | issue = 4| pages = 521–555 | doi=10.5840/monist200386426}}</ref>

=== Meta-emotions ===
{{Main|Meta-emotion}}
The optimal visual artwork creates what Noy & Noy-Sharav call \"meta-emotions\". These are multiple emotions that are triggered at the same time. They posit that what people see when immediately looking at a piece of artwork are the formal, technical qualities of the work and its complexity. Works that are well-made but lacking in appropriate complexity, or works that are intricate but missing in technical skill will not produce \"meta-emotions\".<ref name=\"noy\">{{cite journal | last1 = Noy | first1 = P. | last2 = Noy-Sharav | first2 = D. | year = 2013 | title = Art and Emotions | url = | journal = International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 100–107 | doi = 10.1002/aps.1352 }}</ref> For example, seeing a perfectly painted chair (technical quality but no complexity) or a sloppily drawn image of [[Christ]] on the cross (complex but no skill) would be unlikely to stimulate deep emotional responses. However, beautifully painted works of Christ's [[crucifixion]] are likely make people who can relate or who understand the story behind it weep.

Noy & Noy-Sharav also claim that art is the most potent form of emotional communication. They cite examples of people being able to listen to and [[dance]] to [[music]] for hours without getting tired and literature being able to take people to far away, imagined lands inside their heads. Art forms give humans a higher satisfaction in emotional release than simply managing emotions on their own. Art allows people to have a cathartic release of pent-up emotions either by creating work or by witnessing and pseudo-experiencing what they see in front of them. Instead of being passive recipients of actions and images, art is intended for people to challenge themselves and work through the emotions they see presented in the artistic message.<ref name=\"noy\" />

There is debate among researchers as to what types of emotions works of art can elicit; whether these are defined emotions such as anger, confusion or happiness, or a general feeling of aesthetic appreciation.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Looking past pleasure: Anger, confusion, disgust, pride, surprise, and other unusual aesthetic emotions.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=1|pages=48–51|doi=10.1037/a0014632|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/P_Silvia_Looking_2009.pdf}}</ref> The aesthetic experience seems to be determined by liking or disliking a work of art, placed along a continuum of pleasure–displeasure.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> However, other diverse emotions can still be felt in response to art, which can be sorted into three categories: Knowledge Emotions, Hostile Emotions, and Self-Conscious Emotions.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />

===Liking and comprehensibility ===
Pleasure elicited by works of art can also have multiple sources. A number of theories suggest that enjoyment of a work of art is dependent on its comprehensibility or ability to be understood easily.<ref name=Millis-titles>{{cite journal|last=Millis|first=Keith|title=Making meaning brings pleasure: The influence of titles on aesthetic experiences.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2001|volume=1|issue=3|pages=320–329|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.320|pmid=12934689}}</ref> Therefore, when more information about a work of art is provided, such as a title, description, or artist's statement, researchers predict that viewers will understand the piece better, and demonstrate greater liking for it.<ref name=Millis-titles /> Experimental evidence shows that the presence of a title for a work increases perceived understanding, regardless of whether that title is elaborative or descriptive.<ref name=Millis-titles />  Elaborative titles did affect aesthetic responses to the work, suggesting viewers were not creating alternative explanations for the works if an explaining title is given.<ref name=Millis-titles /> Descriptive or random titles do not show any of these effects.<ref name=Millis-titles />

Furthering the thought that pleasure in art derives from its comprehensibility and processing fluency, some authors have described this experience as an emotion.<ref name=Armstrong-Beauty>{{cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=Thomas|author2=Detweiler-Bedell, Brian|title=Beauty as an emotion: The exhilarating prospect of mastering a challenging world.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2008|volume=12|issue=4|pages=305–329|doi=10.1037/a0012558|citeseerx=10.1.1.406.1825}}</ref> The emotional feeling of beauty, or an aesthetic experience, does not have a valence emotional undercurrent, rather is general cognitive arousal due to the fluent processing of a novel stimuli.<ref name=Armstrong-Beauty /> Some authors believe that aesthetic emotions is enough of a unique and verifiable experience that it should be included in general theories of emotion.<ref name=Armstrong-Beauty />

 |width = 25%
 |align= right
 |bgcolor= #c6dbf7
}}

===Knowledge emotions===
Knowledge emotions deal with reactions to thinking and feeling, such as interest, confusion, and surprise.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> They often stem from self-analysis of what the viewer knows, expects, and perceives.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /><ref name=Silvia-confusion /> This set of emotions also spur actions that motivate further learning and thinking.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />

====Interest====
Interest in a work of art arises from perceiving the work as new, complex, and unfamiliar, as well as understandable.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /><ref name=Silvia-confusion /> This dimension is studied most often by aesthetics researchers, and can be equated with aesthetic pleasure or an aesthetic experience.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> This stage of art experience usually occurs as the viewer understands the artwork they are viewing, and the art fits into their knowledge and expectations while providing a new experience.<ref name=Silvia-confusion />

====Confusion====
Confusion can be viewed as an opposite to interest, and serves as a signal to the self to inform the viewer that they cannot comprehend what they are looking at, and confusion often necessitates a shift in action to remedy the lack of understanding.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /><ref name=Silvia-confusion>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Confusion and interest: The role of knowledge emotions in aesthetic experience.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2010|volume=4|issue=2|pages=75–80|doi=10.1037/a0017081|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/P_Silvia_Confusion_in%20press.pdf}}</ref> Confusion is thought to stem from uncertainty, and a lack of one's expectations and knowledge being met by a work of art.<ref name=Silvia-confusion /> 
Confusion is most often experienced by art novices, and therefore must often be dealt with by those in arts education.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />

====Surprise====
Surprise functions as a disruption of current action to alert a viewer to a significant event.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> The emotion is centered around the experience of something new and unexpected, and can be ellicied by sensory incongruity.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> Art can ellicit surprise when expectations about the work are not met, but the work changes those expectations in an understandable way.

===Hostile emotions===
Hostile emotions toward art are often very visible in the form of anger or frustration, and can result in censorship, but are less easily described by a continuum of aesthetic pleasure-displeasure.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> These reactions center around the hostility triad: anger, disgust, and contempt.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />  These emotions often motivate aggression, self-assertion, and violence, and arise from perception of the artist's deliberate trespass onto the expectations of the viewer.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />

===Self-conscious emotions===
{{Main|Self-conscious emotions}}
Self-conscious emotions are responses that reflect upon the self and one's actions, such as pride, guilt, shame, regret and embarrassment.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> These are much more complex emotions, and involve assessing events as agreeing with one's self-perception or not, and adjusting one's behavior accordingly.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> There are numerous instances of artists expressing self-conscious emotions in response to their art, and self-conscious emotions can also be felt collectively.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />

====Sublime feelings====
Researchers have investigated the experience of the sublime, viewed as similar to aesthetic appreciation, which causes general psychological arousal.<ref name=Eskine-sublime>{{cite journal|last=Eskine|first=Kendall J.|author2=Kacinik, Natalie A.|author3= Prinz, Jesse J.|title=Stirring images: Fear, not happiness or arousal, makes art more sublime.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2012|volume=12|issue=5|pages=1071–1074|doi=10.1037/a0027200}}</ref> The sublime feeling has been connected to a feeling of happiness in response to art, but may be more related to an experience of fear.<ref name=Eskine-sublime /> Researchers have shown that feelings of fear induced before looking at artwork results in more sublime feelings in response to those works.<ref name=Eskine-sublime />

====Aesthetic chills====
{{Main|Aesthetic chills}}
Another common emotional response is that of chills when viewing a work of art. The feeling is predicted to be related to similar aesthetic experiences such as awe, feeling touched, or absorption.<ref name=Silvia-chills>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|author2=Nusbaum, Emily C.|title=On personality and piloerection: Individual differences in aesthetic chills and other unusual aesthetic experiences.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2011|volume=5|issue=3|pages=208–214|doi=10.1037/a0021914|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/P_Silvia_Personality_2011.pdf}}</ref> Personality traits along the Big 5 Inventory have been shown to be predictors of a person's experience of aesthetic chills, especially a high rating on Openness to Experience.<ref name=Silvia-chills /> This counters the effect of fluid intelligence, where those with higher amounts of fluid intelligence are less likely to experience chills.<ref name=Silvia-chills /> Experience with the arts also predicts someone's experience of aesthetic chills, but this may be due to them experiencing art more frequently.<ref name=Silvia-chills />

===Effects of expertise===
The fact that art is analyzed and experienced differently by those with artistic training and expertise than those who are artistically naive has been shown numerous times. Researchers have tried to understand how experts interact with art so differently from the art naive, as experts tend to like more abstract compositions, and show a greater liking for both modern and classical types of art.<ref name=Leder-appreciated>{{cite journal|last=Leder|first=Helmut|author2=Gerger, Gernot|author3= Dressler, Stefan G.|author4= Schabmann, Alfred|title=How art is appreciated.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=2–10|doi=10.1037/a0026396}}</ref> Experts also exhibit more arousal when looking at modern and abstract works, while non-experts show more arousal to classical works.<ref name=Leder-appreciated />

Other researchers predicted that experts find more complex art interesting because they have changed their appraisals of art to create more interest, or are possibly making completely different types of appraisals than novices.<ref name=Silvia-expertise>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Artistic training and interest in visual art: Applying the appraisal model of aesthetic emotions|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2006|volume=24|issue=2|pages=139–161|doi=10.2190/dx8k-6wea-6wpa-fm84}}</ref> Experts described works rated high in complexity as easier to understand and more interesting than did novices, possibly as experts tend to use more idiosyncratic criteria when judging artworks.<ref name=Silvia-expertise /> However, experts seem to use the same appraisals of emotions that novices do, but these appraisals are at a higher level, because a wider range of art is comprehensible to experts.<ref name=Silvia-expertise />

====Expertise and museum visits====
Due to most art being in museums and galleries, most people have to make deliberate choices to interact with art. Researchers are interested in what types of experiences and emotions people are looking for when going to experience art in a museum.<ref name=Mastandera-muesum>{{cite journal|last=Mastandrea|first=Stefano|author2=Bartoli, G.|author3=Bove, G.|title=Learning through ancient art and experincing emotions with contemporary art: Comparing visits in two different museums|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2007|volume=25|issue=2|pages=173–191|doi=10.2190/r784-4504-37m3-2370}}</ref> Most people respond that they visit museums to experience 'the pleasure of art' or 'the desire for cultural learning', but when broken down, visitors of museums of classical art are more motivated to see famous works and learn more about them.<ref name=Mastandera-muesum /> Visitors in contemporary art museums were more motivated by a more emotional connection to the art, and went more for the pleasure than a learning experience.<ref name=Mastandera-muesum /> Predictors of who would prefer to go to which type of museum lay in education level, art fluency, an socio-economic status.<ref name=Mastandera-muesum />

==Theories and models of elicited emotions==
Researchers have offered a number of theories to describe emotional responses to art, often aligning with the various theories of the basis of emotions. Authors have argued that the emotional experience is created explicitly by the artist and mimicked in the viewer, or that the emotional experience of art is a by-product of the analysis of that work.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /><ref name=Fellous-review />

===Appraisal theory===
The [[appraisal theory]] of emotions centers on the assumption that it is the evaluation of events, and not the events themselves, that cause emotional experiences.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> Emotions are then created by different groups of appraisal structures that events are analyzed through.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> When applied to art, appraisal theories argue that various artistic structures, such as complexity, prototypically, and understanding are used as appraisal structures, and works that show more typical art principles will create a stronger aesthetic experience .<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> Appraisal theories suggest that art is experienced as interesting after being analyzed through a novelty check and coping-potential check, which analyze the art's newness of experience for the viewer, and the viewer's ability to understand the new experience.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> Experimental evidence suggests that art is preferred when the viewer finds it easier to understand, and that interest in a work is predictable with knowledge of the viewer's ability to process complex visual works, which supports the appraisal theory.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> People with higher levels of artistic expertise and knowledge often prefer more complex works of art. Under appraisal theory, experts have a different emotional experience to art due to a preference for more complex works that they can understand better than a naive viewer.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart />

====Appraisal and negative emotions====
A newer take on this theory focuses on the consequences of the emotions elicited from art, both positive and negative. The original theory argues that positive emotions are the result of a biobehavioral reward system, where a person feels a positive emotion when they have completed a personal goal.<ref name=cooper-opposingart>{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Jessica M.|author2=Paul J. Silvia|title=Opposing art: Rejection as an action tendency of hostile aesthetic emotions|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2009|volume=27|issue=1|pages=109–126|doi=10.2190/em.27.1.f}}</ref> These emotional rewards create actions by motivating approach or withdrawal from a stimuli, depending if the object is positive or negative to the person.<ref name=cooper-opposingart /> However, these theories have not often focused on negative emotions, especially negative emotional experiences from art.<ref name=cooper-opposingart /> These emotions are central to experimental aesthetics research in order to understand why people have negative, rejecting, condemning, or censoring reactions to works of art.<ref name=cooper-opposingart /> By showing research participants controversial photographs, rating their feelings of anger, and measuring their subsequent actions, researchers found that the participants that felt hostile toward the photographs displayed more rejection of the works.<ref name=cooper-opposingart /> This suggests that negative emotions towards a work of art can create a negative action toward it, and suggests the need for further research on negative reactions towards art.<ref name=cooper-opposingart />

===Minimal model===
Other psychologists believe that emotions are of minimal functionality, and are used to move a person towards incentives and away from threats.<ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole>{{cite journal|last=Xenakis|first=Ioannis|author2=Arnellos, Argyris|author3= Darzentas, John|title=The functional role of emotions in aesthetic judgment|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|date=1 August 2012|volume=30|issue=2|pages=212–226|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2011.09.003}}</ref> Therefore, positive emotions are felt upon the attainment of a goal, and negative emotions when a goal has failed to be achieved.<ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole />   The basic states of pleasure or pain can be adapted to aesthetic experiences by a disinterested buffer, where the experience is not explicitly related to the goal-reaching of the person, but a similar experience can be analyzed from a disinterested distance.<ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole /> These emotions are disinterested because the work of art or artist's goals are not affecting the person's well being, but the viewer can feel whether or not those goals were achieved from a third-party distance.

===Five-step aesthetic experience===
Other theorists have focused their models on the disrupting and unique experience that comes from the interacting with a powerful work of art. An early model focused on a two-part experience: facile recognition and meta-cognitive perception, or the experience of the work of art and the mind's analysis of that experience.<ref name=Pelowski-5part>{{cite journal|last=Pelowski|first=Matthew|author2=Akiba, Fuminori|title=A model of art perception, evaluation and emotion in transformative aesthetic experience|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|date=1 August 2011|volume=29|issue=2|pages=80–97|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2010.04.001}}</ref> A further cognitive model strengthens this idea into a five-part emotional experience of a work of art.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> As this five-part model is new, it remains only a theory, as not much empirical evidence for the model had been researched yet.

====Part one: Pre-expectations and self-image====
The first stage of this model focuses on the viewer's expectations of the work before seeing it, based on their previous experiences, their observational strategies, and the relation of the work to themselves.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> Viewers who tend to appreciate art, or know more about it will have different expectations at this stage than those who are not engaged by art.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />

====Part two: Cognitive mastery and introduction of discrepancy ====
After viewing the work of art, people will make an initial judgment and classification of the work,  often based on their preconceptions of the work.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> After initial classification, viewers attempt to understand the motive and meaning of the work, which can then inform their perception of the work, creating a cycle of changing perception and the attempt to understand it.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> It is at this point any discrepancies between expectations and the work, or the work and understanding arise.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />

====Part three: Secondary control and escape====
When an individual finds a discrepancy in their understanding that cannot be resolved or ignored, they move to the third stage of their interaction with a work of art.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> At this point, interaction with the work has switched from lower-order and unconscious processes to higher-order cognitive involvement, and tension and frustration starts to be felt.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> In order to maintain their self-assumptions and to resolve the work, an individual will try to change their environment in order for the issue to be resolved or ignored.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />  This can be done by re-classifying the work and its motives, blaming the discrepancy on an external source, or attempting to escape the situation or mentally withdraw from the work.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />

====Part four: Meta-cognitive reassessment====
If viewers cannot escape or reassess the work, they are forced to reassess the self and their interactions with works of art.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />  This experience of self-awareness through a work of art is often externally caused, rather than internally motivated, and starts a transformative process to understand the meaning of the discrepant work, and edit their own self-image.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />

====Part five: Aesthetic outcome and new mastery====
After the self-transformation and change in expectations, the viewer resets their interaction with the work, and begins the process anew with deeper self-understanding and cognitive mastery of the artwork.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />

==Pupillary response tests==
In order to research emotional responses to art, researchers often rely on behavioral data.<ref name=Leder-pupil>{{cite journal|last=Kuchinke|first=Lars|author2=Trapp, Sabrina|author3= Jacobs, Arthur M.|author4= Leder, Helmut|title=Pupillary responses in art appreciation: Effects of aesthetic emotions.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=156–163|doi=10.1037/a0014464}}</ref>  But new psychophysilogical methods of measuring emotional response are beginning to be used, such as the measurement of pupillary response.<ref name=Leder-pupil /> Pupil responses have been predicted to indicate image pleasantness and emotional arousal, but can be confounded by luminance, and confusion between an emotion's positive or negative valence, requiring an accompanying verbal explanation of emotional state.<ref name=Rembrandt>{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=W. Ryan|author2=Schirillo, James A.|title=Hemispheric laterality measured in Rembrandt's portraits using pupil diameter and aesthetic verbal judgements|journal=Cognition & Emotion|date=1 August 2011|volume=25|issue=5|pages=868–885|doi=10.1080/02699931.2010.515709|pmid=21432647}}</ref> Pupil dilatations have been found to predict emotional responses and the amount of information the brain is processing, measures important in testing emotional response ellicted by artwork.<ref name=Leder-pupil /> Further, the existence of pupillary responses to artwork can be used as an argument that art does ellicit emotional responses with physiological reactions.<ref name=Leder-pupil /> 
[[File:Juan Gris 004.jpg|thumb|An example Cubist work by Juan Gris]]

===Pupil responses to art===
After viewing Cubist paintings of varying complexity, abstraction, and familiarity, participants' pupil responses were greatest when viewing aesthetically pleasing artwork, and highly accessible art, or art low in abstraction.<ref name=Leder-pupil /> Pupil responses also correlated with personal preferences of the cubist art.<ref name=Leder-pupil /> High pupil responses were also correlated with faster cognitive processing, supporting theories that aesthetic emotions and preferences are related to the brain's ease of processing the stimuli.<ref name=Leder-pupil />

====Left-cheek biases====
[[File:Rembrandt - Minerva - WGA19246.jpg|thumb|''Minerva'' Rembrandt. Female portrait showing left-cheek orientation]]
These effects are also seen when investigating the Western preference for left-facing portraits. This skew towards left-cheek is found in the majority of Western portraits, and is rated as more pleasing than other portrait orientations.<ref name=Blackburn-pupil>{{cite journal|last=Blackburn|first=Kelsey|author2=Schirillo, James|title=Emotive hemispheric differences measured in real-life portraits using pupil diameter and subjective aesthetic preferences|journal=Experimental Brain Research|date=19 April 2012|volume=219|issue=4|pages=447–455|doi=10.1007/s00221-012-3091-y|pmid=22526951}}</ref> Theories for this preference suggest that the left side of the face as more emotionally descriptive and expressive, which lets viewers connect to this emotional content better.<ref name=Blackburn-pupil /> Pupil response tests were used to test emotional response to different types of portraits, left or right cheek, and pupil dilation was linearly related to the pleasantness of the portrait, with increased dilations for pleasant images, and constrictions for unpleasant images.<ref name=Blackburn-pupil /> Left-facing portraits were rated as more pleasant, even when mirrored to appear right-facing, suggesting that people are more attracted to more emotional facial depictions.<ref name=Blackburn-pupil />

This research was continued, using portraits by [[Rembrandt]] featuring females with a left-cheek focus and males with a right-cheek focus.<ref name=Rembrandt />  Researchers predicted Rembrandt chose to portray his subjects this way to elicit different emotional responses in his viewers related to which portrait cheek was favored.<ref name=Rembrandt /> In comparison to previous studies, increased pupil size was only found for male portraits with a right-cheek preference. This may be because the portraits were viewed as domineering, and the subsequent pupil response was due to unpleasantness.<ref name=Rembrandt /> As pupil dilation is more indicative of strength of emotional response than the valence, a verbal description of emotional responses should accompany further pupillary response tests.<ref name=Rembrandt />

==Art as emotional regulation==
Art is also used as an emotional regulator, most often in [[Art Therapy]] sessions. Studies have shown that creating art can serve as a method of short-term [[mood (psychology)|mood]] regulation.<ref name=Drake-venting>{{cite journal|last=Drake|first=Jennifer E.|author2=Winner, Ellen|title=Confronting sadness through art-making: Distraction is more beneficial than venting.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=3|pages=255–261|doi=10.1037/a0026909|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f91b7cd8bbc586fc9cc71b03bc97fe7ca7fb76c1}}</ref><ref name=Dalebroux-venting>{{cite journal|last=Dalebroux|first=Anne|author2=Goldstein, Thalia R.|author3= Winner, Ellen|title=Short-term mood repair through art-making: Positive emotion is more effective than venting|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume=32|issue=4|pages=288–295|doi=10.1007/s11031-008-9105-1|year=2008}}</ref> This type of regulation falls into two categories: venting and distraction.<ref name=Drake-venting /> Artists in all fields of the arts have reported emotional venting and distraction through the creation of their art.<ref name=Drake-venting /><ref name=Dalebroux-venting />

===Venting===
Venting through art is the process of using art to attend to and discharge negative emotions.<ref name=Drake-venting /> However, research has shown venting to be a less effective method of emotional regulation. Research participants asked to draw either an image related to a sad movie they just watched, or a neutral house, demonstrated less negative mood after the neutral drawing.<ref name=Drake-venting /> Venting drawings did improve negative mood more than no drawing activity.<ref name=Drake-venting /> Other research suggests that this is because analyzing negative emotions can have a helpful effect, but immersing in negative emotions can have a deleterious effect.<ref name=Dalebroux-venting />

===Distraction===
Distraction is the process of creating art to oppose, or in spite of negative emotions.<ref name=Drake-venting /> This can also take the form of fantasizing, or creating an opposing positive to counteract a negative affect.<ref name=Dalebroux-venting /> Research has demonstrated that distractive art making activities improve mood greater than venting activities.<ref name=Drake-venting /> Distractive drawings were shown to decrease negative emotions more than venting drawings or no drawing task even after participants were asked to recall their saddest personal memories.<ref name=Drake-venting /> These participants also experienced an increase in positive affect after a distractive drawing task.<ref name=Drake-venting /> The change in mood valence after a distractive drawing task is even greater when participants are asked to create happy drawings to counter their negative mood.<ref name=Dalebroux-venting />

[[Category:Aesthetics]]
[[Category:Emotion]]","In [[psychology of art]], the relationship between '''art and emotion''' has newly been the subject of extensive study thanks to the intervention of esteemed art historian [[Alexander Nemerov]]. [[Emotion]]al or aesthetic responses to [[art]] have previously been viewed as basic stimulus response, but new theories and research have suggested that these experiences are more complex and able to be studied experimentally.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Emotional Responses to Art: From Collation and Arousal to Cognition and Emotion.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2005|volume=9|issue=4|pages=342–357|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.9.4.342|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/Emotional%20Responses%20to%20Art.pdf}}</ref> Emotional responses are often regarded as the keystone to experiencing art, and the creation of an emotional experience has been argued as the purpose of artistic expression.<ref name=Fellous-review>{{cite journal|last=Fellous|first=Jean-Marc|title=A mechanistic view of the expression and experience of emotion in the arts. Deeper that reason: Emotion and its role in literature, music and art by Jenefer Robinson|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|year=2006|volume=119|issue=4|pages=668–674|doi=10.2307/20445371|jstor=20445371}}</ref> Research has shown that the neurological underpinnings of perceiving art differ from those used in standard object recognition.<ref name=Cupchick-neuro>{{cite journal|last=Cupchik|first=Gerald C.|author2=Vartanian, Oshin|author3= Crawley, Adrian|author4= Mikulis, David J.|title=Viewing artworks: Contributions of cognitive control and perceptual facilitation to aesthetic experience|journal=Brain and Cognition|date=1 June 2009|volume=70|issue=1|pages=84–91|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2009.01.003|pmid=19223099}}</ref>  Instead, [[brain]] regions involved in the experience of emotion and goal setting show activation when viewing art.<ref name=Cupchick-neuro />

== Basis for emotional responses to art ==
Evolutionary ancestry has hard-wired humans to have affective responses for certain patterns and traits. These predispositions lend themselves to responses when looking at certain visual arts as well. Identification of subject matter is the first step in understanding the visual image. Being presented with visual stimuli creates initial confusion. Being able to comprehend a figure and background creates closure and triggers the pleasure centers of the brain by remedying the confusion. Once an image is identified, meaning can be created by accessing memory relative to the visual stimuli and associating personal memories with what is being viewed.<ref name=\"barry\">{{cite journal | last1 = Barry | first1 = A | year = 2006 | title = Perceptual Aesthetics: Transcendent Emotion, Neurological Image | url = | journal = Visual Communication Quarterly | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 134–151 | doi = 10.1207/s15551407vcq1303_2 }}</ref>

Other methods of stimulating initial interest that can lead to emotion involves pattern recognition. [[Symmetry]] is often found in works of art, and the human brain unconsciously searches for symmetry for a number of reasons. Potential predators were [[Symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]], as were potential prey. Bilateral symmetry also exists in humans, and a healthy human is typically relatively symmetrical. This attraction to symmetry was therefore advantageous, as it helped humans recognize danger, food, and mates. Art containing symmetry therefore is typically approached and positively valenced to humans.<ref name=\"barry\" />

Another example is to observe paintings or photographs of bright, open landscapes that often evoke a feeling of beauty, [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], or happiness. This connection to pleasant emotions exists because it was advantageous to humans before today's society to be able to see far into the distance in a brightly lit vista. Similarly, visual images that are dark and/or obscure typically elicit emotions of [[anxiety]] and fear. This is because an impeded visual field is disadvantageous for a human to be able to defend itself.<ref name=\"carroll\">{{cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = N | title = Art and Mood | year = 2003 | url = | journal = Monist | volume = 86 | issue = 4| pages = 521–555 | doi=10.5840/monist200386426}}</ref>

=== Meta-emotions ===
{{Main|Meta-emotion}}
The optimal visual artwork creates what Noy & Noy-Sharav call \"meta-emotions\". These are multiple emotions that are triggered at the same time. They posit that what people see when immediately looking at a piece of artwork are the formal, technical qualities of the work and its complexity. Works that are well-made but lacking in appropriate complexity, or works that are intricate but missing in technical skill will not produce \"meta-emotions\".<ref name=\"noy\">{{cite journal | last1 = Noy | first1 = P. | last2 = Noy-Sharav | first2 = D. | year = 2013 | title = Art and Emotions | url = | journal = International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 100–107 | doi = 10.1002/aps.1352 }}</ref> For example, seeing a perfectly painted chair (technical quality but no complexity) or a sloppily drawn image of [[Christ]] on the cross (complex but no skill) would be unlikely to stimulate deep emotional responses. However, beautifully painted works of Christ's [[crucifixion]] are likely make people who can relate or who understand the story behind it weep.

Noy & Noy-Sharav also claim that art is the most potent form of emotional communication. They cite examples of people being able to listen to and [[dance]] to [[music]] for hours without getting tired and literature being able to take people to far away, imagined lands inside their heads. Art forms give humans a higher satisfaction in emotional release than simply managing emotions on their own. Art allows people to have a cathartic release of pent-up emotions either by creating work or by witnessing and pseudo-experiencing what they see in front of them. Instead of being passive recipients of actions and images, art is intended for people to challenge themselves and work through the emotions they see presented in the artistic message.<ref name=\"noy\" />

==Types of elicited emotions==

There is debate among researchers as to what types of emotions works of art can elicit; whether these are defined emotions such as anger, confusion or happiness, or a general feeling of aesthetic appreciation.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Looking past pleasure: Anger, confusion, disgust, pride, surprise, and other unusual aesthetic emotions.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=1|pages=48–51|doi=10.1037/a0014632|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/P_Silvia_Looking_2009.pdf}}</ref> The aesthetic experience seems to be determined by liking or disliking a work of art, placed along a continuum of pleasure–displeasure.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> However, other diverse emotions can still be felt in response to art, which can be sorted into three categories: Knowledge Emotions, Hostile Emotions, and Self-Conscious Emotions.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />

===Liking and comprehensibility ===
Pleasure elicited by works of art can also have multiple sources. A number of theories suggest that enjoyment of a work of art is dependent on its comprehensibility or ability to be understood easily.<ref name=Millis-titles>{{cite journal|last=Millis|first=Keith|title=Making meaning brings pleasure: The influence of titles on aesthetic experiences.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2001|volume=1|issue=3|pages=320–329|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.320|pmid=12934689}}</ref> Therefore, when more information about a work of art is provided, such as a title, description, or artist's statement, researchers predict that viewers will understand the piece better, and demonstrate greater liking for it.<ref name=Millis-titles /> Experimental evidence shows that the presence of a title for a work increases perceived understanding, regardless of whether that title is elaborative or descriptive.<ref name=Millis-titles />  Elaborative titles did affect aesthetic responses to the work, suggesting viewers were not creating alternative explanations for the works if an explaining title is given.<ref name=Millis-titles /> Descriptive or random titles do not show any of these effects.<ref name=Millis-titles />

Furthering the thought that pleasure in art derives from its comprehensibility and processing fluency, some authors have described this experience as an emotion.<ref name=Armstrong-Beauty>{{cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=Thomas|author2=Detweiler-Bedell, Brian|title=Beauty as an emotion: The exhilarating prospect of mastering a challenging world.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2008|volume=12|issue=4|pages=305–329|doi=10.1037/a0012558|citeseerx=10.1.1.406.1825}}</ref> The emotional feeling of beauty, or an aesthetic experience, does not have a valence emotional undercurrent, rather is general cognitive arousal due to the fluent processing of a novel stimuli.<ref name=Armstrong-Beauty /> Some authors believe that aesthetic emotions is enough of a unique and verifiable experience that it should be included in general theories of emotion.<ref name=Armstrong-Beauty />

 |width = 25%
 |align= right
 |bgcolor= #c6dbf7
}}

===Knowledge emotions===
Knowledge emotions deal with reactions to thinking and feeling, such as interest, confusion, and surprise.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> They often stem from self-analysis of what the viewer knows, expects, and perceives.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /><ref name=Silvia-confusion /> This set of emotions also spur actions that motivate further learning and thinking.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />

====Interest====
Interest in a work of art arises from perceiving the work as new, complex, and unfamiliar, as well as understandable.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /><ref name=Silvia-confusion /> This dimension is studied most often by aesthetics researchers, and can be equated with aesthetic pleasure or an aesthetic experience.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> This stage of art experience usually occurs as the viewer understands the artwork they are viewing, and the art fits into their knowledge and expectations while providing a new experience.<ref name=Silvia-confusion />

====Confusion====
Confusion can be viewed as an opposite to interest, and serves as a signal to the self to inform the viewer that they cannot comprehend what they are looking at, and confusion often necessitates a shift in action to remedy the lack of understanding.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /><ref name=Silvia-confusion>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Confusion and interest: The role of knowledge emotions in aesthetic experience.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2010|volume=4|issue=2|pages=75–80|doi=10.1037/a0017081|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/P_Silvia_Confusion_in%20press.pdf}}</ref> Confusion is thought to stem from uncertainty, and a lack of one's expectations and knowledge being met by a work of art.<ref name=Silvia-confusion /> 
Confusion is most often experienced by art novices, and therefore must often be dealt with by those in arts education.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />

====Surprise====
Surprise functions as a disruption of current action to alert a viewer to a significant event.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> The emotion is centered around the experience of something new and unexpected, and can be ellicied by sensory incongruity.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> Art can ellicit surprise when expectations about the work are not met, but the work changes those expectations in an understandable way.

===Hostile emotions===
Hostile emotions toward art are often very visible in the form of anger or frustration, and can result in censorship, but are less easily described by a continuum of aesthetic pleasure-displeasure.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> These reactions center around the hostility triad: anger, disgust, and contempt.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />  These emotions often motivate aggression, self-assertion, and violence, and arise from perception of the artist's deliberate trespass onto the expectations of the viewer.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />

===Self-conscious emotions===
Self-conscious emotions are responses that reflect upon the self and one's actions, such as pride, guilt, shame, regret and embarrassment.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> These are much more complex emotions, and involve assessing events as agreeing with one's self-perception or not, and adjusting one's behavior accordingly.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /> There are numerous instances of artists expressing self-conscious emotions in response to their art, and self-conscious emotions can also be felt collectively.<ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure />

====Sublime feelings====
Researchers have investigated the experience of the sublime, viewed as similar to aesthetic appreciation, which causes general psychological arousal.<ref name=Eskine-sublime>{{cite journal|last=Eskine|first=Kendall J.|author2=Kacinik, Natalie A.|author3= Prinz, Jesse J.|title=Stirring images: Fear, not happiness or arousal, makes art more sublime.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2012|volume=12|issue=5|pages=1071–1074|doi=10.1037/a0027200}}</ref> The sublime feeling has been connected to a feeling of happiness in response to art, but may be more related to an experience of fear.<ref name=Eskine-sublime /> Researchers have shown that feelings of fear induced before looking at artwork results in more sublime feelings in response to those works.<ref name=Eskine-sublime />

====Aesthetic chills====
{{Main|Aesthetic chills}}
Another common emotional response is that of chills when viewing a work of art. The feeling is predicted to be related to similar aesthetic experiences such as awe, feeling touched, or absorption.<ref name=Silvia-chills>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|author2=Nusbaum, Emily C.|title=On personality and piloerection: Individual differences in aesthetic chills and other unusual aesthetic experiences.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2011|volume=5|issue=3|pages=208–214|doi=10.1037/a0021914|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/P_Silvia_Personality_2011.pdf}}</ref> Personality traits along the Big 5 Inventory have been shown to be predictors of a person's experience of aesthetic chills, especially a high rating on Openness to Experience.<ref name=Silvia-chills /> This counters the effect of fluid intelligence, where those with higher amounts of fluid intelligence are less likely to experience chills.<ref name=Silvia-chills /> Experience with the arts also predicts someone's experience of aesthetic chills, but this may be due to them experiencing art more frequently.<ref name=Silvia-chills />

===Effects of expertise===
The fact that art is analyzed and experienced differently by those with artistic training and expertise than those who are artistically naive has been shown numerous times. Researchers have tried to understand how experts interact with art so differently from the art naive, as experts tend to like more abstract compositions, and show a greater liking for both modern and classical types of art.<ref name=Leder-appreciated>{{cite journal|last=Leder|first=Helmut|author2=Gerger, Gernot|author3= Dressler, Stefan G.|author4= Schabmann, Alfred|title=How art is appreciated.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=2–10|doi=10.1037/a0026396}}</ref> Experts also exhibit more arousal when looking at modern and abstract works, while non-experts show more arousal to classical works.<ref name=Leder-appreciated />

Other researchers predicted that experts find more complex art interesting because they have changed their appraisals of art to create more interest, or are possibly making completely different types of appraisals than novices.<ref name=Silvia-expertise>{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Artistic training and interest in visual art: Applying the appraisal model of aesthetic emotions|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2006|volume=24|issue=2|pages=139–161|doi=10.2190/dx8k-6wea-6wpa-fm84}}</ref> Experts described works rated high in complexity as easier to understand and more interesting than did novices, possibly as experts tend to use more idiosyncratic criteria when judging artworks.<ref name=Silvia-expertise /> However, experts seem to use the same appraisals of emotions that novices do, but these appraisals are at a higher level, because a wider range of art is comprehensible to experts.<ref name=Silvia-expertise />

====Expertise and museum visits====
Due to most art being in museums and galleries, most people have to make deliberate choices to interact with art. Researchers are interested in what types of experiences and emotions people are looking for when going to experience art in a museum.<ref name=Mastandera-muesum>{{cite journal|last=Mastandrea|first=Stefano|author2=Bartoli, G.|author3=Bove, G.|title=Learning through ancient art and experincing emotions with contemporary art: Comparing visits in two different museums|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2007|volume=25|issue=2|pages=173–191|doi=10.2190/r784-4504-37m3-2370}}</ref> Most people respond that they visit museums to experience 'the pleasure of art' or 'the desire for cultural learning', but when broken down, visitors of museums of classical art are more motivated to see famous works and learn more about them.<ref name=Mastandera-muesum /> Visitors in contemporary art museums were more motivated by a more emotional connection to the art, and went more for the pleasure than a learning experience.<ref name=Mastandera-muesum /> Predictors of who would prefer to go to which type of museum lay in education level, art fluency, an socio-economic status.<ref name=Mastandera-muesum />

==Theories and models of elicited emotions==
Researchers have offered a number of theories to describe emotional responses to art, often aligning with the various theories of the basis of emotions. Authors have argued that the emotional experience is created explicitly by the artist and mimicked in the viewer, or that the emotional experience of art is a by-product of the analysis of that work.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /><ref name=Fellous-review />

===Appraisal theory===
The [[appraisal theory]] of emotions centers on the assumption that it is the evaluation of events, and not the events themselves, that cause emotional experiences.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> Emotions are then created by different groups of appraisal structures that events are analyzed through.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> When applied to art, appraisal theories argue that various artistic structures, such as complexity, prototypically, and understanding are used as appraisal structures, and works that show more typical art principles will create a stronger aesthetic experience .<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> Appraisal theories suggest that art is experienced as interesting after being analyzed through a novelty check and coping-potential check, which analyze the art's newness of experience for the viewer, and the viewer's ability to understand the new experience.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> Experimental evidence suggests that art is preferred when the viewer finds it easier to understand, and that interest in a work is predictable with knowledge of the viewer's ability to process complex visual works, which supports the appraisal theory.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /> People with higher levels of artistic expertise and knowledge often prefer more complex works of art. Under appraisal theory, experts have a different emotional experience to art due to a preference for more complex works that they can understand better than a naive viewer.<ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart />

====Appraisal and negative emotions====
A newer take on this theory focuses on the consequences of the emotions elicited from art, both positive and negative. The original theory argues that positive emotions are the result of a biobehavioral reward system, where a person feels a positive emotion when they have completed a personal goal.<ref name=cooper-opposingart>{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Jessica M.|author2=Paul J. Silvia|title=Opposing art: Rejection as an action tendency of hostile aesthetic emotions|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2009|volume=27|issue=1|pages=109–126|doi=10.2190/em.27.1.f}}</ref> These emotional rewards create actions by motivating approach or withdrawal from a stimuli, depending if the object is positive or negative to the person.<ref name=cooper-opposingart /> However, these theories have not often focused on negative emotions, especially negative emotional experiences from art.<ref name=cooper-opposingart /> These emotions are central to experimental aesthetics research in order to understand why people have negative, rejecting, condemning, or censoring reactions to works of art.<ref name=cooper-opposingart /> By showing research participants controversial photographs, rating their feelings of anger, and measuring their subsequent actions, researchers found that the participants that felt hostile toward the photographs displayed more rejection of the works.<ref name=cooper-opposingart /> This suggests that negative emotions towards a work of art can create a negative action toward it, and suggests the need for further research on negative reactions towards art.<ref name=cooper-opposingart />

===Minimal model===
Other psychologists believe that emotions are of minimal functionality, and are used to move a person towards incentives and away from threats.<ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole>{{cite journal|last=Xenakis|first=Ioannis|author2=Arnellos, Argyris|author3= Darzentas, John|title=The functional role of emotions in aesthetic judgment|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|date=1 August 2012|volume=30|issue=2|pages=212–226|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2011.09.003}}</ref> Therefore, positive emotions are felt upon the attainment of a goal, and negative emotions when a goal has failed to be achieved.<ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole />   The basic states of pleasure or pain can be adapted to aesthetic experiences by a disinterested buffer, where the experience is not explicitly related to the goal-reaching of the person, but a similar experience can be analyzed from a disinterested distance.<ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole /> These emotions are disinterested because the work of art or artist's goals are not affecting the person's well being, but the viewer can feel whether or not those goals were achieved from a third-party distance.

===Five-step aesthetic experience===
Other theorists have focused their models on the disrupting and unique experience that comes from the interacting with a powerful work of art. An early model focused on a two-part experience: facile recognition and meta-cognitive perception, or the experience of the work of art and the mind's analysis of that experience.<ref name=Pelowski-5part>{{cite journal|last=Pelowski|first=Matthew|author2=Akiba, Fuminori|title=A model of art perception, evaluation and emotion in transformative aesthetic experience|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|date=1 August 2011|volume=29|issue=2|pages=80–97|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2010.04.001}}</ref> A further cognitive model strengthens this idea into a five-part emotional experience of a work of art.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> As this five-part model is new, it remains only a theory, as not much empirical evidence for the model had been researched yet.

====Part one: Pre-expectations and self-image====
The first stage of this model focuses on the viewer's expectations of the work before seeing it, based on their previous experiences, their observational strategies, and the relation of the work to themselves.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> Viewers who tend to appreciate art, or know more about it will have different expectations at this stage than those who are not engaged by art.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />

====Part two: Cognitive mastery and introduction of discrepancy ====
After viewing the work of art, people will make an initial judgment and classification of the work,  often based on their preconceptions of the work.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> After initial classification, viewers attempt to understand the motive and meaning of the work, which can then inform their perception of the work, creating a cycle of changing perception and the attempt to understand it.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> It is at this point any discrepancies between expectations and the work, or the work and understanding arise.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />

====Part three: Secondary control and escape====
When an individual finds a discrepancy in their understanding that cannot be resolved or ignored, they move to the third stage of their interaction with a work of art.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> At this point, interaction with the work has switched from lower-order and unconscious processes to higher-order cognitive involvement, and tension and frustration starts to be felt.<ref name=Pelowski-5part /> In order to maintain their self-assumptions and to resolve the work, an individual will try to change their environment in order for the issue to be resolved or ignored.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />  This can be done by re-classifying the work and its motives, blaming the discrepancy on an external source, or attempting to escape the situation or mentally withdraw from the work.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />

====Part four: Meta-cognitive reassessment====
If viewers cannot escape or reassess the work, they are forced to reassess the self and their interactions with works of art.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />  This experience of self-awareness through a work of art is often externally caused, rather than internally motivated, and starts a transformative process to understand the meaning of the discrepant work, and edit their own self-image.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />

====Part five: Aesthetic outcome and new mastery====
After the self-transformation and change in expectations, the viewer resets their interaction with the work, and begins the process anew with deeper self-understanding and cognitive mastery of the artwork.<ref name=Pelowski-5part />

==Pupillary response tests==
In order to research emotional responses to art, researchers often rely on behavioral data.<ref name=Leder-pupil>{{cite journal|last=Kuchinke|first=Lars|author2=Trapp, Sabrina|author3= Jacobs, Arthur M.|author4= Leder, Helmut|title=Pupillary responses in art appreciation: Effects of aesthetic emotions.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=156–163|doi=10.1037/a0014464}}</ref>  But new psychophysilogical methods of measuring emotional response are beginning to be used, such as the measurement of pupillary response.<ref name=Leder-pupil /> Pupil responses have been predicted to indicate image pleasantness and emotional arousal, but can be confounded by luminance, and confusion between an emotion's positive or negative valence, requiring an accompanying verbal explanation of emotional state.<ref name=Rembrandt>{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=W. Ryan|author2=Schirillo, James A.|title=Hemispheric laterality measured in Rembrandt's portraits using pupil diameter and aesthetic verbal judgements|journal=Cognition & Emotion|date=1 August 2011|volume=25|issue=5|pages=868–885|doi=10.1080/02699931.2010.515709|pmid=21432647}}</ref> Pupil dilatations have been found to predict emotional responses and the amount of information the brain is processing, measures important in testing emotional response ellicted by artwork.<ref name=Leder-pupil /> Further, the existence of pupillary responses to artwork can be used as an argument that art does ellicit emotional responses with physiological reactions.<ref name=Leder-pupil /> 
[[File:Juan Gris 004.jpg|thumb|An example Cubist work by Juan Gris]]

===Pupil responses to art===
After viewing Cubist paintings of varying complexity, abstraction, and familiarity, participants' pupil responses were greatest when viewing aesthetically pleasing artwork, and highly accessible art, or art low in abstraction.<ref name=Leder-pupil /> Pupil responses also correlated with personal preferences of the cubist art.<ref name=Leder-pupil /> High pupil responses were also correlated with faster cognitive processing, supporting theories that aesthetic emotions and preferences are related to the brain's ease of processing the stimuli.<ref name=Leder-pupil />

====Left-cheek biases====
[[File:Rembrandt - Minerva - WGA19246.jpg|thumb|''Minerva'' Rembrandt. Female portrait showing left-cheek orientation]]
These effects are also seen when investigating the Western preference for left-facing portraits. This skew towards left-cheek is found in the majority of Western portraits, and is rated as more pleasing than other portrait orientations.<ref name=Blackburn-pupil>{{cite journal|last=Blackburn|first=Kelsey|author2=Schirillo, James|title=Emotive hemispheric differences measured in real-life portraits using pupil diameter and subjective aesthetic preferences|journal=Experimental Brain Research|date=19 April 2012|volume=219|issue=4|pages=447–455|doi=10.1007/s00221-012-3091-y|pmid=22526951}}</ref> Theories for this preference suggest that the left side of the face as more emotionally descriptive and expressive, which lets viewers connect to this emotional content better.<ref name=Blackburn-pupil /> Pupil response tests were used to test emotional response to different types of portraits, left or right cheek, and pupil dilation was linearly related to the pleasantness of the portrait, with increased dilations for pleasant images, and constrictions for unpleasant images.<ref name=Blackburn-pupil /> Left-facing portraits were rated as more pleasant, even when mirrored to appear right-facing, suggesting that people are more attracted to more emotional facial depictions.<ref name=Blackburn-pupil />

This research was continued, using portraits by [[Rembrandt]] featuring females with a left-cheek focus and males with a right-cheek focus.<ref name=Rembrandt />  Researchers predicted Rembrandt chose to portray his subjects this way to elicit different emotional responses in his viewers related to which portrait cheek was favored.<ref name=Rembrandt /> In comparison to previous studies, increased pupil size was only found for male portraits with a right-cheek preference. This may be because the portraits were viewed as domineering, and the subsequent pupil response was due to unpleasantness.<ref name=Rembrandt /> As pupil dilation is more indicative of strength of emotional response than the valence, a verbal description of emotional responses should accompany further pupillary response tests.<ref name=Rembrandt />

==Art as emotional regulation==
Art is also used as an emotional regulator, most often in [[Art Therapy]] sessions. Studies have shown that creating art can serve as a method of short-term [[mood (psychology)|mood]] regulation.<ref name=Drake-venting>{{cite journal|last=Drake|first=Jennifer E.|author2=Winner, Ellen|title=Confronting sadness through art-making: Distraction is more beneficial than venting.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=3|pages=255–261|doi=10.1037/a0026909|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f91b7cd8bbc586fc9cc71b03bc97fe7ca7fb76c1}}</ref><ref name=Dalebroux-venting>{{cite journal|last=Dalebroux|first=Anne|author2=Goldstein, Thalia R.|author3= Winner, Ellen|title=Short-term mood repair through art-making: Positive emotion is more effective than venting|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume=32|issue=4|pages=288–295|doi=10.1007/s11031-008-9105-1|year=2008}}</ref> This type of regulation falls into two categories: venting and distraction.<ref name=Drake-venting /> Artists in all fields of the arts have reported emotional venting and distraction through the creation of their art.<ref name=Drake-venting /><ref name=Dalebroux-venting />

===Venting===
Venting through art is the process of using art to attend to and discharge negative emotions.<ref name=Drake-venting /> However, research has shown venting to be a less effective method of emotional regulation. Research participants asked to draw either an image related to a sad movie they just watched, or a neutral house, demonstrated less negative mood after the neutral drawing.<ref name=Drake-venting /> Venting drawings did improve negative mood more than no drawing activity.<ref name=Drake-venting /> Other research suggests that this is because analyzing negative emotions can have a helpful effect, but immersing in negative emotions can have a deleterious effect.<ref name=Dalebroux-venting />

===Distraction===
Distraction is the process of creating art to oppose, or in spite of negative emotions.<ref name=Drake-venting /> This can also take the form of fantasizing, or creating an opposing positive to counteract a negative affect.<ref name=Dalebroux-venting /> Research has demonstrated that distractive art making activities improve mood greater than venting activities.<ref name=Drake-venting /> Distractive drawings were shown to decrease negative emotions more than venting drawings or no drawing task even after participants were asked to recall their saddest personal memories.<ref name=Drake-venting /> These participants also experienced an increase in positive affect after a distractive drawing task.<ref name=Drake-venting /> The change in mood valence after a distractive drawing task is even greater when participants are asked to create happy drawings to counter their negative mood.<ref name=Dalebroux-venting />

===Trump administration===
After Trump's January 2017 inauguration, Grisham was named deputy press secretary for [[Sean Spicer]] in the West Wing of the White House.<ref name=\"fox10phoenix\"/><ref name=\"Fortune06142019\"/>

In March 2017, First Lady Melania Trump moved her over to the East Wing.<ref name=\"Fortune06142019\"/><ref name=sentinel_20170327 /> A former White House colleague said that the president regretted losing Grisham to the first lady's office because of Grisham's loyalty and skill at handling the press while acting as his traveling press secretary. During that time, she built relationships with many reporters at events. Despite losing Grisham as part of his own staff, President Trump said he was satisfied that the first lady would \"be in good hands\". Grisham was described by several sources who had worked with her previously as being \"highly competent\" and \"self-aware\"; some suggested that she enjoyed \"trolling the press.\" <ref name=\"Beast\">{{cite web |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-white-house-wont-stop-melania-from-contradicting-trump|title=The White House Won't Stop Melania From Contradicting Trump|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|last=Markay|first=Lachlan|date=August 7, 2018|accessdate=November 5, 2018}}</ref>

The [[United States Office of Special Counsel]] stated that Grisham violated the [[Hatch Act of 1939]] following a complaint by Senator [[Tom Carper]]. Grisham was accused of using her official [[Twitter]] account on July 11, 2018, to tweet out Trump's campaign slogan. Violation of the act is not a crime, but a workplace guideline, and the agency responded by sending Grisham a warning letter.<ref name=\"Hatch\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/melania-trump-spokesperson-violate-hatch-act-1132130|title=Melania Trump's Spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham Violated Hatch Act With 'Make America Great Again' Tweet|last=Hutzler|first=Alexandra|work=[[Newsweek]] |date=October 9, 2018|accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref>

On September 5, 2019, the ''[[Washington Examiner]]'' published an opinion piece written by Grisham and her deputy [[Hogan Gidley]] entitled, \"The ''Washington Post''{{'}}s lost summer.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/the-washington-posts-lost-summer|title=The Washington Post's lost summer |first1=Stephanie |last1=Grisham |first2=Hogan |last2=Gidley |date=September 5, 2019 |website=[[Washington Examiner]] |accessdate=September 6, 2019}}</ref> The authors asserted the ''Post'' had not reported on several Trump accomplishments that the paper actually did report.

On September 23, 2019, when asked by the hosts of Fox & Friends if the White House planned to resume its daily press briefing Grisham said \"not right now... I mean, ultimately, if the president decides that it's something we should do, we can do that, but right now he's doing just fine. And to be honest, the briefings have become a lot of theater. And I think that a lot of reporters were doing it to get famous. I mean, yeah, they're writing books now. I mean, they're all getting famous off of this presidency.

On October 24, 2019, appearing on Fox & Friends, Grisham defended Trump's description of \"Never Trump Republicans\" as \"Human scum\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1187063301731209220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=https://www.foxnews.com/media/press-secretary-stephanie-grisham-trump-human-scum|title=The Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats.

The people who are against him and who have been against him and working against his [agenda] since the day they took office are just that. It is horrible that people are working against a president who is delivering results for this country and has been since day one. And, the fact that people continue to try to negate anything he's been trying to do and take away from the good work he's doing on behalf of the American people, they deserve strong language like that.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/media/press-secretary-stephanie-grisham-trump-human-scum|title=Press secretary Grisham on Trump's 'human scum' tweet: Those working against him are 'just that'|last=Musto|first=Julia|date=October 24, 2019|website=Fox News|language=en-US|access-date=November 15, 2019}}</ref>

On October 26, 2019, in response to criticism of President Trump by his former chief of staff Gen. [[John F. Kelly]] (Ret.) Grisham stated: \"I worked with John Kelly, and he was totally unequipped to handle the genius of our President.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/26/john-kelly-trump-impeachment-yes-man-058450|title=White House hits back at John Kelly over impeachment remarks|last=Semones|first=Evan |date=October 26, 2019 |website=POLITICO |access-date=November 15, 2019}}</ref>

On November 13, 2019, during the testimony of [[William B.

That same month, Grisham claimed that Obama administration officials had left \"you will fail\" notes for the incoming Trump administration officials. Numerous Obama administration officials rejected the claim.

==Incidents of driving while intoxicated==
On January 9, 2013, Grisham was pulled over for speeding in [[Gilbert, Arizona|Gilbert]], [[Maricopa County, Arizona]]. The officer observed Grisham's signs of intoxication, and she failed a field sobriety test. Grisham denied consuming any alcohol, but said she had taken a [[Xanax]] 90 minutes earlier and a [[Zoloft]] the prior night. A blood test revealed Grisham's blood alcohol content to be .105 percent, which is above the .08 legal limit in Arizona. She also was found to be driving on a suspended license since August 2012 for failure to answer a traffic citation. In August 2014, Grisham accepted a plea bargain agreement that reduced the charge to misdemeanor reckless driving, plus two years of probation.<ref name=azr_20190626 /><ref name=\"NYTimes_20190625\" /><ref name=\"tsg_20190828\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/arizona/press-secretary-collars-162053|title=Like So Many Of His Associates, Donald Trump's New Press Secretary Has Posed For Some Mug Shots|date=August 28, 2019|website=The Smoking Gun|language=en|access-date=November 15, 2019}}</ref> She returned to court twice for failure to pay the $779 in fines and failure to complete a [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] program.<ref name=azr_20190626 />

===Trump administration===
After Trump's January 2017 inauguration, Grisham was named deputy press secretary for [[Sean Spicer]] in the West Wing of the White House.<ref name=\"fox10phoenix\"/><ref name=\"Fortune06142019\"/>

In March 2017, First Lady Melania Trump moved her over to the East Wing.<ref name=\"Fortune06142019\"/><ref name=sentinel_20170327 /> A former White House colleague said that the president regretted losing Grisham to the first lady's office because of Grisham's loyalty and skill at handling the press while acting as his traveling press secretary. During that time, she built relationships with many reporters at events. Despite losing Grisham as part of his own staff, President Trump said he was satisfied that the first lady would \"be in good hands\". Grisham was described by several sources who had worked with her previously as being \"highly competent\" and \"self-aware\"; some suggested that she enjoyed \"trolling the press.\" <ref name=\"Beast\">{{cite web |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-white-house-wont-stop-melania-from-contradicting-trump|title=The White House Won't Stop Melania From Contradicting Trump|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|last=Markay|first=Lachlan|date=August 7, 2018|accessdate=November 5, 2018}}</ref>

The [[United States Office of Special Counsel]] stated that Grisham violated the [[Hatch Act of 1939]] following a complaint by Senator [[Tom Carper]]. Grisham was accused of using her official [[Twitter]] account on July 11, 2018, to tweet out Trump's campaign slogan. Violation of the act is not a crime, but a workplace guideline, and the agency responded by sending Grisham a warning letter.<ref name=\"Hatch\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/melania-trump-spokesperson-violate-hatch-act-1132130|title=Melania Trump's Spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham Violated Hatch Act With 'Make America Great Again' Tweet|last=Hutzler|first=Alexandra|work=[[Newsweek]] |date=October 9, 2018|accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref>

On September 23, 2019, when asked by the hosts of Fox & Friends if the White House planned to resume its daily press briefing Grisham said \"not right now... I mean, ultimately, if the president decides that it's something we should do, we can do that, but right now he's doing just fine. And to be honest, the briefings have become a lot of theater.
