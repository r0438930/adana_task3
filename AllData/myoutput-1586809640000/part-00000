The parents of the children exchange stories and the Fitpatricks tell the Ellerbys that they are naming their son Leonard Fitzpatrick, after his great-grandfather. The Ellerbys exclaim that they are naming their daughter after her great-grandmother, Amanda Ellerby. Angelina predicts that the two children will be best friends and makes them promise they will celebrate this day together every year. A year later, on Amanda and Leo's first birthday, the Ellerbys and Fitpatricks are surprised to find themselves together again. It turns out that both families have been booked into the same birthday room at the Magic Castle Birthday Party Palace by mistake. They spend Amanda and Leo's birthday together, watching the two bond and even take their first steps together. The two children become friends.\n\nThe night before Amanda and Leo's 11th birthday, Amanda is busy practicing back handsprings with her friend Stephanie for the next day's gymnastics tryouts at school. The girls want to get on the team in order to become friends with the popular girls. Amanda's mother arrives home from work, and Amanda notices that her mother has sent Leo an invitation to her party and gets upset. She is still angry because she overheard Leo tell his friends that he thought it was stupid that he had to spend his birthday with a girl, but she doesn\u2019t have many other friends so he wouldn\u2019t want to tell her and hurt her feelings. After that Amanda refused to speak to Leo, locking away all of their pictures and even throwing the flowerpot that she had hand painted with Leo on their 5th birthday, along with the plant in it, out her window.\n\nThe day of Amanda tucker is awesome!!! and Leo's birthday does not go well for Amanda. She has to take the bus to school and forgets her lunch, and there is a pop quiz in class. She fails the gymnastics tryouts although Stephanie makes the team. When it comes time for her birthday party, most of her friends end up ditching in favor of Leo's. The night ends with her finding out that her mother has been fired from her job because she had mistakenly switched an important work presentation with her sister's science presentation. Amanda she goes to bed tired and disappointed. \n\nWhen Amanda wakes up the next morning it seems as if the whole day is playing out exactly like the day before. At first she believes everybody is playing a cruel joke but finally it dawns on her that it is the day of her birthday all over again. She does everything exactly the same as before, afraid to change any details. It's only when she's getting ready for her party she realizes that she is stuck in a time loop.\n\nThe following morning is exactly the same as the previous two days but this time Amanda decides to fake sick and stay home. Her neighbor takes her to the doctor where she lets slip something about an old family feud between the Ellerbys and the Fitzpatricks but she doesn\u2019t know much about it, so Amanda doesn\u2019t pursue it. Her party ends up being cancelled and she spends the night with her family. In the morning, Amanda realizes that she's still stuck on the same day. Frustrated and confused she goes to school but this time, while she's sitting in class, she sees Leo wink at her, which makes her realize the two of them are stuck in this time loop together.\n\nAmanda is relieved the next morning when nobody remembers that they are angry with her and she is no longer grounded. She even remembers to remind her mom about taking the right presentation. At school, Amanda and Leo finally get the chance to talk. He apologizes to her for the things he said and tells her he only said them because he wanted to look cool in front of his friends. They both agree that they miss each other and become friends again and decide tomorrow they are going to skip school and go out since there will be no consequences the next day.\n\nThe next morning Amanda fakes sick and stays home. When her dad falls asleep, she sneaks out to meet up with Leo. Leo has the whole day planned and it starts with them going for breakfast where Leo orders lots of food he would never normally get to eat. He then leads her to an open mic poetry reading where he gets up in front of the crowd and reads some of his own poetry. Leo then proceeds to take Amanda to an audition for a band looking for a drummer. After much coaxing Amanda agrees to try out. The band members are impressed, but they tell her to come back when she is older. Exhilarated, the two finally head to the mall where security grabs them and turns them over to their families who are worried sick about them.\n\nThe day goes as it normally does but after school Amanda and Leo go visit the Senior Community Center and ask around about the family feud that Amanda's neighbor had previously mentioned. They find out that their grandfathers used to own competing apple groves and they would always do things to try and harm the others\u2019 farm. Then, however, they suddenly made up for unknown reasons. Amanda and Leo still need more answers so they decide to go to the Willow Falls Historical Society the next day.\n\nThey go to the Willow Falls Historical Society where they find Angelina. She tells them that the town had sought the help of someone special who told the two men that they had to patch up their differences by the Harvest Day or else there would be consequences. Angelina claims she doesn\u2019t know anymore and the only thing that would have more information would be a journal that was stolen a while ago. Amanda and Leo ultimately come back the next day to sneak into the historical society and look around for the journal because they think she actually stashed the journal somewhere in the place. They end up finding Leo's great-grandfather's journal instead which revealed that because they didn\u2019t heed the woman's warning and patch things up within the year they went through a time loop as well until they resolved their differences and fixed all the damage they caused. Amanda and Leo are confused because they made up a week ago but they are still stuck. They decide to help everyone that they possibly can tomorrow in hopes that it will fix things. The next day, Amanda and Leo help everybody that they possibly can, such as reminding her mother about the presentation mix up, even though her mother still gets fired, suggesting that some things are meant to be. Amanda manages to make the gymnastics team. During their birthday parties they decide to merge them and both Leo and Amanda have high hopes they have broken the time loop.\n\nIn the morning, Amanda realizes that she is celebrating her birthday again for the 11th time. She is frustrated but when she gets on the bus she sees the Angelina is the bus driver and ultimately she gives her and Leo some answers. She reveals that she was the one who put the spell their great-grandfathers and was worried that it would transfer over to them. She insists that this shouldn\u2019t have happened though because on their 5th birthday she gave them plants protecting them from the curse. As long as they had the plants close they shouldn\u2019t have fallen into the time loop. Leo claims that's his is still sitting in his room but Amanda admits that she threw hers out the window a year ago on the night of their tenth birthday. Angelina makes them hurry back to class where everything goes as normal, except this time Amanda tries out for the marching band instead of the gymnastics team, something she secretly had wanted to do the whole time. When Amanda gets home from school she is relieved to find the plant still in the bushes under her window and she returns it back to its place in her bedroom. Both Amanda and Leo decide that they are just going to have one mom party together this time where they spend the night laughing together just like old times. To both Amanda and Leo's relief, the next morning is finally the day after their birthday. Amanda and Leo make a pact that they will always stay in touch with each other so that it won\u2019t happen again.\n\n== Reception and awards ==\n''11 Birthdays'', was positively received by both the general public and critics.

The two have celebrated every previous birthday together (they were born on the same day), but a misunderstanding on their 10th has gone unresolved.
