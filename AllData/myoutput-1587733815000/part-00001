The Panthers compete in the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and the East Division of [[Conference USA]] (CUSA). The Panthers' head coach is [[Butch Davis]]. FIU has produced a Sun Belt Conference co-championship team in 2010, along with 3 postseason bowl appearances. The Panthers play their home games at [[Riccardo Silva Stadium]] which has a seating capacity of 20,000.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|List of FIU Panthers football seasons}}\n\n===Don Strock era (2002\u20132006)===\nOn 1 September 1999, after several years of contemplating the commencement of a football team, FIU moved a step closer by hiring [[Don Strock]] to be FIU's Director of Football Operations. One year later, [[Don Strock]] was named head coach with plans to lay the foundations for a college football team. Quarter-back David Tabor was the first FIU football recruit. In February 2002, FIU found its star quarter-back in high school, Jamie Burke from Cardinal Mooney High, Sarasota, Florida. Burke was the only player to ever throw for over 500 yards in a single game in Florida as well as led the state in touchdown passes in a season with 34. Burke was being recruited by the [[University of Florida]] but opted for FIU when [[Steve Spurrier]] left to coach the [[Washington Redskins]]. FIU had everything it needed to begin competing in [[NCAA]] Football. FIU was placed in the [[Division I-AA]] level as an Independent team.\n\nFIU won its inaugural game on August 29, 2002 against [[Saint Peter's College (New Jersey)]], 27\u20133. The team played fairly well against the competition that season and managed to finish with a 5-6 record. The Golden Panthers then hoped to build on that in the coming 2003 season. FIU signed to play more challenging teams of the division in hopes to get more recognition as a solid football team. The opening game of the following season started with a loss to Indiana State, and it led to a 0\u20138 start for the second-year team. They failed to reach the standard set the season before and fell to a 2\u201310 season. The next season followed with similar results, finishing with a 3\u20137 record.\n\nAfter the 2004 season, FIU moved up to [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] FBS, formerly known as [[Division I-A]], despite their relative lack of success in their first three seasons in Division I FCS. FIU became the fastest school in the history of college football to reach the highest level.  This has since been eclipsed by multiple schools during the conference movement in 2012.\n\n[[File:FIU Stadium.JPG|thumb|250px|The Panthers play at the on-campus [[Riccardo Silva Stadium]] in [[Miami, Florida]].]]\n\nThe Panthers moved to Division I-A in 2005. Many of the season's players were from the 2003 recruiting class. [[Keyonvis Bouie]], FIU's linebacker recorded 118 tackles in nine games, 11 for a loss and three interceptions. A second linebacker, [[Antwan Barnes]] recorded 15 tackles for a loss and added 11 sacks to his statistics. On offense, FIU's quarterback, [[Josh Padrick]] who passed for 2743 yards and 13 touchdowns. His primary target was [[Chandler Williams]], who caught 61 passes for a total of 870 yards. It was these defensive performances that allowed FIU to compete with the teams in Division I-A and finish the season 5\u20136.\n\nFIU had found the foundation upon which the team would be built. As characteristic of FIU's athletic department, the following year, FIU signed to play harder teams. FIU was headed in the right direction but still lacked consistency, and organization. As they began their 2006 season they almost evenly matched the teams which they played, losing almost all of their first few games by very narrow margins: [[Middle Tennessee]] 7\u20136, [[University of South Florida|USF]] 21\u201320, [[Bowling Green State University|Bowling Green]] 33\u201328, [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland]] 14\u201310, and [[University of North Texas]] 22\u201325 (7OTs).\n\n{{See also|Florida International University \u2013 University of Miami brawl}}\nOn October 14, 2006, FIU and the [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami Hurricanes]] met for the first time in what was supposed to be the beginning of an annual cross-town [[sports rivalry|rivalry game]].

That same year, the FIU Athletics Department hired a new athletic director [[Pete Garcia]], and found a new head coach for the team, [[Mario Cristobal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article1945156.html|title=FIU fires football coach Cristobal|publisher=}}</ref> Cristobal became the second youngest Division I-A coach at 37. Cristobal brought in a new coaching staff in hopes to turn the program around.\n\nIn 2007, FIU was the second-youngest team in Division I-A. 2/3 were underclassmen, mostly freshmen. During the 2007 season, FIU played its home games in the [[Miami Orange Bowl]] during the expansion of Riccardo Silva Stadium to 20,000 seats. The Golden Panthers concluded the season with a win against North Texas 38\u201319. It was the last college football game ever played at the historic Orange Bowl prior to its demolition and the last home win at that stadium. In September 2008, the Panthers inaugurated the expanded Riccardo Silva Stadium by hosting the [[South Florida Bulls]] with a crowd of over 16,000. FIU lost the game 17\u20139. The team would go on to win the next three games in a showing of a much improved team from the 2006 and 2007 team.\n\nOn Saturday, November 27, 2010, FIU defeated [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] to clinch the Sun Belt Conference Title. This earned FIU its first bowl berth in the short history of its football program. Twenty-nine days later, on December 26, they became [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl|Little Caesars Champions]].

On offense, FIU's receiver Chandler Williams, caught 67 passes for 664 yards.\n\n===Mario Cristobal era (2007\u20132012)===\nIn 2006, Barnes and Williams were both drafted to the NFL. That same year, the FIU Athletics Department hired a new athletic director [[Pete Garcia]], and found a new head coach for the team, [[Mario Cristobal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article1945156.html|title=FIU fires football coach Cristobal|publisher=}}</ref> Cristobal became the second youngest Division I-A coach at 37. Cristobal brought in a new coaching staff in hopes to turn the program around.\n\nIn 2007, FIU was the second-youngest team in Division I-A. 2/3 were underclassmen, mostly freshmen. During the 2007 season, FIU played its home games in the [[Miami Orange Bowl]] during the expansion of Riccardo Silva Stadium to 20,000 seats. The Golden Panthers concluded the season with a win against North Texas 38\u201319. It was the last college football game ever played at the historic Orange Bowl prior to its demolition and the last home win at that stadium. In September 2008, the Panthers inaugurated the expanded Riccardo Silva Stadium by hosting the [[South Florida Bulls]] with a crowd of over 16,000. FIU lost the game 17\u20139. The team would go on to win the next three games in a showing of a much improved team from the 2006 and 2007 team.\n\nOn Saturday, November 27, 2010, FIU defeated [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] to clinch the Sun Belt Conference Title. This earned FIU its first bowl berth in the short history of its football program. Twenty-nine days later, on December 26, they became [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl|Little Caesars Champions]]. Fans brought signs saying, \"\u00a1S\u00ed se puede!\", Spanish for \"Yes we can!\" On December 3, 2011, FIU accepted an invitation to play in the [[2011 Beef 'O' Brady's Bowl]], the school's second consecutive bowl game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/12/26/1989534/with-this-bowl-game-no-more-f.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928130813/http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/12/26/1989534/with-this-bowl-game-no-more-f.html |archivedate=2011-09-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID%3D205042871%26DB_OEM_ID%3D11700 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407122104/http://www.fiusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=205042871&DB_OEM_ID=11700 |archivedate=2012-04-07 }}</ref>\n\nAfter going from an 8\u20135 season in 2011 to a 3\u20139 season in 2012, FIU Athletic Director Pete Garcia made the decision to fire Cristobal because \"we\u2019ve gone backwards over the last year and a half.
