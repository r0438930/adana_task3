Rawlinson (1873) believed that it is derived from the name of the Babylonian king and god [[Belus (Babylonian)|Belus]]. Dames (1904) believed that it is derived from the Persian term for [[cockscomb]], said to have been used as a crest on the helmets of Baloch troops in 6th century BCE. Herzfeld (1968) proposed that it is derived from the [[Median language|Median]] term ''brza-vaciya'', which describes a loud or aggressive way of speaking. Naseer Dashti (2012) presents another possibility, that of being derived from the name of the ethnic group 'Balaschik' living in Balashagan, between the [[Caspian Sea]] and [[Lake Van]] in present-day Turkey and Azerbaijan, who are believed to have migrated to Balochistan during the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] times.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=8,&nbsp;33\u201334,&nbsp;44}} The remnants of the original name such as 'Balochuk' and 'Balochiki' are said to be still used as ethnic names in Balochistan.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nSome writers suggest a derivation from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] words ''bal'', meaning strength, and ''och'' meaning high or magnificent.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=33\u201334}} An earliest Sanskrit reference to the Baloch might be the Gwalior inscription of the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] ruler [[Mihira Bhoja]] (r. 836\u2013885), which says that the dynasty's founder [[Nagabhata I]] repelled a powerful army of ''Valacha Mlecchas'', translated as \"Baluch foreigners\" by [[D.

Based on an analysis of the linguistic connections of the Balochi language, which is one of the [[Western Iranian languages]], the original homeland of the Balochi tribes was likely to the east or southeast of the central [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] region. The Baloch began migrating towards the east in the late [[Sasanian]] period. The cause of the migration is unknown but may have been as a result of the generally unstable conditions in the Caspian area. The migrations occurred over several centuries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baluchistan-iii |title=BALUCHISTAN iii. Baluchi Language and Literature |author=J.

[[Adud al-Dawla]] of the Buyid dynasty launched a punitive campaign against them and defeated them in 971\u2013972. After this, the Baloch continued their eastward migration towards what is now Balochistan province of Pakistan, although some remained behind and there are still Baloch in eastern part of the Iranian [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province|Sistan-Baluchestan]] and [[Kerman province|Kerman]] provinces.

In ancient times, especially during the pre-Islamic era, it was common for Baloch women to perform [[Persian dance|dances]] and sing [[Balochi music|folk songs]] at different events. The tradition of a Baloch mother singing lullabies to her children has played an important role in the transfer of knowledge from generation to generation since ancient times.

Rawlinson (1873) believed that it is derived from the name of the Babylonian king and god [[Belus (Babylonian)|Belus]]. Dames (1904) believed that it is derived from the Persian term for [[cockscomb]], said to have been used as a crest on the helmets of Baloch troops in 6th century BCE. Herzfeld (1968) proposed that it is derived from the [[Median language|Median]] term ''brza-vaciya'', which describes a loud or aggressive way of speaking. Naseer Dashti (2012) presents another possibility, that of being derived from the name of the ethnic group 'Balaschik' living in Balashagan, between the [[Caspian Sea]] and [[Lake Van]] in present-day Turkey and Azerbaijan, who are believed to have migrated to Balochistan during the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] times.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=8,&nbsp;33\u201334,&nbsp;44}} The remnants of the original name such as 'Balochuk' and 'Balochiki' are said to be still used as ethnic names in Balochistan.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nSome writers suggest a derivation from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] words ''bal'', meaning strength, and ''och'' meaning high or magnificent.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=33\u201334}} An earliest Sanskrit reference to the Baloch might be the Gwalior inscription of the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] ruler [[Mihira Bhoja]] (r. 836\u2013885), which says that the dynasty's founder [[Nagabhata I]] repelled a powerful army of ''Valacha Mlecchas'', translated as \"Baluch foreigners\" by [[D.

Based on an analysis of the linguistic connections of the Balochi language, which is one of the [[Western Iranian languages]], the original homeland of the Balochi tribes was likely to the east or southeast of the central [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] region. The Baloch began migrating towards the east in the late [[Sasanian]] period. The cause of the migration is unknown but may have been as a result of the generally unstable conditions in the Caspian area.
