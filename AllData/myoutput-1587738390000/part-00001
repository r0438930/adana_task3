Local detective Ralph Anderson quickly identifies strong evidence pointing to [[little league]] coach Terry Maitland, including testimony from multiple witnesses and [[security camera]] footage. Ralph, whose own late son was coached by Terry, is enraged, and has him publicly arrested at a little league game. Terry insists on his innocence, and his wife, Glory, promptly calls their family lawyer, Howard Salomon.  Alec Pelley, a [[private investigator]] hired by Salomon, tracks down evidence that Terry was at an out-of-town conference at the time of the murder, including [[television news|news footage]] of Terry speaking at the conference.  Both sides are left with extremely decisive but contradictory evidence. Salomon is certain Terry will be vindicated, but Terry is left in jail waiting for his arraignment.  Meanwhile, the Peterson family disintegrates, with Frank's mother suffering an [[emotional breakdown]] that escalates into a [[heart attack]].

Fred Peterson, the sole surviving member of the family, attempts suicide by hanging, but he is only left [[coma]]tose. Ralph is put on leave, and hot-headed detective Jack Hoskins is called to substitute.  The case continues to gnaw at Ralph, who investigates the van used by the killer and identifies that it was in the same location as the Maitlands during a family trip to [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]], earlier that year.  While questioning a reluctant Glory about that trip, Ralph learns from her older daughter that Terry received a small cut on his wrist, supposedly from a male nurse at his father's nursing home.

While attempting to speak with Terry's father at his [[nursing home]], Holly discovers that a male nurse at the institution was convicted of murdering two young girls around the time of the visit.  The nurse is shown in prison concurrently, where he commits suicide to avoid being killed by another inmate.

The doppelganger who committed the murder scratches a stranger before assuming their form and repeating the pattern in this new target's city.  Terry is the latest target, with the nurse in Dayton Heath Hofstadter and a woman named Maria Caneles in [[Harlem]], [[New York City]] preceding him.  A woman in Harlem explains her belief to Holly that the perpetrator is a [[boogeyman]] who feeds on the suffering of its victims and their families.  An increasingly erratic Jack leaves furniture and a dead animal in the woods for the entity who controls him and communicates with him.

In Dayton, Holly theorizes about the shape-shifting creature killing children. She visits the cemeteries of both Heath Hofstadter and his alleged victims, finding dilapidated buildings nearby and photographing them. She believes that the creature would live in these buildings to feed on the suffering of those visiting the graves.  She also meets a man associated with Heath, who later commits [[suicide-by-cop]] and is shown to have the same sores on his neck as Jack.  Holly suggests Ralph take photographs around Terry's grave, and Ralph's partner Yunis Sablo notices that the barn where the clothes were found is right by the cemetery.  Holly opts to drive back to Cherokee City to debrief Ralph, Howie and Alec.  The night before, she invites Andy Katcavage, a Dayton security officer (and former police detective) with whom she's had a courtship, up to her hotel room.  Holly leaves the next morning, but her car breaks down on the way out of Dayton.  Andy finds her notes on the investigation and researches them.

Jeannie invites Holly to stay with her and Ralph at their house, where Jeannie increasingly believes in the entity due to the matching descriptions and Holly's theories. Ralph is still skeptical until Holly uses a blue light against the chair where the entity was sitting in Jeannie's dream and finds the same residue found in the barn, as well as fingerprints. Holly now believes the entity is \"shedding\" as it transforms into its next human form. She theorizes it must use a host while it is vulnerable to do its bidding.

Local detective Ralph Anderson quickly identifies strong evidence pointing to [[little league]] coach Terry Maitland, including testimony from multiple witnesses and [[security camera]] footage. Ralph, whose own late son was coached by Terry, is enraged, and has him publicly arrested at a little league game. Terry insists on his innocence, and his wife, Glory, promptly calls their family lawyer, Howard Salomon.  Alec Pelley, a [[private investigator]] hired by Salomon, tracks down evidence that Terry was at an out-of-town conference at the time of the murder, including [[television news|news footage]] of Terry speaking at the conference.  Both sides are left with extremely decisive but contradictory evidence. Salomon is certain Terry will be vindicated, but Terry is left in jail waiting for his arraignment.  Meanwhile, the Peterson family disintegrates, with Frank's mother suffering an [[emotional breakdown]] that escalates into a [[heart attack]].  A hooded figure with a grotesquely deformed face lingers outside the Maitlands' house, and Glory finds her younger daughter suffering from apparent nightmares of a man in her room telling her \"bad things\".\n |LineColor = 575755\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Roanoke\n |DirectedBy = Jason Bateman\n |WrittenBy = Richard Price\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|12}}\n |Viewers = 0.603<ref name=\"1.01\u20131.02\"/>\n |ShortSummary = Ralph meets Terry at the prison and expresses uncertainty about his decision to have Terry arrested so publicly.  The next day, Joy Peterson, the mother of the victim, dies at the hospital after collapsing at home.  As Terry arrives at the courthouse for his [[arraignment]], the murdered boy's teenage brother opens fire, injuring others and fatally wounding Terry before being killed by Ralph. With his dying breath, Terry insists on his innocence. The deformed man is shown watching the aftermath. Fred Peterson, the sole surviving member of the family, attempts suicide by hanging, but he is only left [[coma]]tose. Ralph is put on leave, and hot-headed detective Jack Hoskins is called to substitute.  The case continues to gnaw at Ralph, who investigates the van used by the killer and identifies that it was in the same location as the Maitlands during a family trip to [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]], earlier that year.  While questioning a reluctant Glory about that trip, Ralph learns from her older daughter that Terry received a small cut on his wrist, supposedly from a male nurse at his father's nursing home.

Ralph goes to Howie Salomon and Alec Pelley with the information he has gathered on the van and the Maitlands' trip to Dayton.  They contact eccentric [[savant]] investigator Holly Gibney to backtrack Terry's movements during the trip. While attempting to speak with Terry's father at his [[nursing home]], Holly discovers that a male nurse at the institution was convicted of murdering two young girls around the time of the visit.  The nurse is shown in prison concurrently, where he commits suicide to avoid being killed by another inmate. Jessa Maitland convinces Glory to let Ralph visit so she can relay a message, but during the meeting Glory refuses to let Ralph talk to Jessa.

The doppelganger who committed the murder scratches a stranger before assuming their form and repeating the pattern in this new target's city.  Terry is the latest target, with the nurse in Dayton Heath Hofstadter and a woman named Maria Caneles in [[Harlem]], [[New York City]] preceding him.  A woman in Harlem explains her belief to Holly that the perpetrator is a [[boogeyman]] who feeds on the suffering of its victims and their families.  An increasingly erratic Jack leaves furniture and a dead animal in the woods for the entity who control and communicates with him.  Ralph identifies on security footage that local [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] Claude Bolton was scratched on his wrist by Maitland's doppelganger the night of the Peterson murder.

Ralph brushes this off as a nightmare of Jeannie's, but he becomes unsettled when her drawing of the intruder closely resembles the boy's drawing of the man who took the van.  In Dayton, Holly theorizes about the shape-shifting creature killing children. She visits the cemeteries of both Heath Hofstadter and his alleged victims, finding dilapidated buildings nearby and photographing them. She believes that the creature would live in these buildings to feed on the suffering of those visiting the graves.  She also meets a man associated with Heath, who later commits [[suicide-by-cop]] and is shown to have the same sores on his neck as Jack.  Holly suggests Ralph take photographs around Terry's grave, and Ralph's partner Yunis Sablo notices that the barn where the clothes were found is right by the cemetery.  Holly opts to drive back to Cherokee City to debrief Ralph, Howie and Alec.  The night before, she invites Andy Katcavage, a Dayton security officer (and former police detective) with whom she's had a courtship, up to her hotel room.  Holly leaves the next morning, but her car breaks down on the way out of Dayton.  Andy finds her notes on the investigation and researches them.

She gives evidence of how all the murders are connected and that she believes \"an entity\" is responsible for the killings. She maintains that the priority is to find the person most recently infected by it and to isolate them. This is received poorly by the police, especially Glory, who berates them all for their incompetence and for even entertaining such a ludicrous explanation. The entity punishes Jack for failing to stop Holly's investigation by appearing in the form of his deceased mother and severely beating him throughout his apartment. Jeannie invites Holly to stay with her and Ralph at their house, where Jeannie increasingly believes in the entity due to the matching descriptions and Holly's theories. Ralph is still skeptical until Holly uses a blue light against the chair where the entity was sitting in Jeannie's dream and finds the same residue found in the barn, as well as fingerprints. Holly now believes the entity is \"shedding\" as it transforms into its next human form. She theorizes it must use a host while it is vulnerable to do its bidding. Jack invites Holly to visit the barn where Terry's clothes were found, but while driving, she notices the rash on the back of his neck.

They search Jack's apartment and find his blood everywhere, eventually tracking Holly and Jack's phones to the same location. Holly, meanwhile, manages to trick and abandon Jack at a gas station and drive away. Jack considers suicide, but he cannot go through with it. Glory, after experiencing more difficulties in her first day back at work, finally decides to file a civil lawsuit against everyone that her attorney Howard suggests. Claude, feeling discomfort in a way he cannot explain, quits his job. When Holly reunites with the others (including Andy, who arrives in Georgia), Yunis shares Claude's situation with her, and Holly angrily confronts Ralph about not revealing it to her earlier. She realizes that Claude's relevance to the case only reinforces her theories, while Ralph continues to struggle with reconciling the unexplainable nature of the events.

Claude, meanwhile, travels to Cecil, [[Tennessee]], to stay with his brother Seale. Holly vows to follow him so he can be both protected and, potentially, exonerated. Ralph, Yunis, and Andy agree to join her. To evade the police, Jack murders a local fisherman (who the entity, currently transforming into Claude, then consumes) and steals his car. Soon after Claude arrives in Tennessee, he is taken into custody by local police who have coordinated with the investigators to protect him. Claude, Seale, and the investigators converge on the Bolton house so they can keep track of Claude. Concurrently, the mid-transformation entity travels to a local cave festival and attempts to lure a young boy so it can eat him. Other festivalgoers manage to stop the entity, however, with the boy's grandfather getting in a scuffle with it before it flees. Meanwhile, Alec and Howard arrive to assist with the investigation. The next morning, local police arrive at the house looking for Claude. They meet with Ralph and Holly, showing them recorded footage of the festival scuffle, which reveals the entity to have a deformed version of Claude's face.

The investigators manage to arrange interviews with the boy who had been lured by the entity and with the boy's grandfather. The boy explains the entity's description of a potential bear cave, while the grandfather describes being unsettled by the entity's face seeming mask-like. A parallel story during the episode, about a father searching for his two boys, is revealed to occur over 70 years earlier, in 1947, when the bear cave collapsed. The [[wikt:search party|search party]], which included some of the Claude and Seale Bolton's ancestors, starved to death after being trapped inside the cave. Due to the location's tragic history which also involves the Bolton family, the investigators conclude that is where the entity is hiding. Additionally, while this is occurring, D.A. Hayes learns of another young boy who has been killed in a manner similar to Frankie. Ralph, Holly, Yunis, Alec, and Andy travel to the cave. Seale recklessly reveals the plan to Claude, immediately alerting the entity to the situation; the entity forces Jack into action.

Andy attempts to drive away for help, but Jack shoots him as well, then shoots the gas tank of the vehicle Andy was driving. Howard tries to rescue Andy, but Jack ignites the gasoline, killing both Andy and Howard. When the entity commands Jack to kill Holly, Jack refuses. He approaches the others, begs them to kill the entity, then commits suicide. Ralph and Holly enter the cave and find the entity, who expresses disbelief that Holly discovered the truth about it. It offers few details when Holly inquires about its history and nature. Claude enters and shoots the entity, causing the cave to collapse; the entity is impaled by falling debris. Before the three exit the cave, Ralph encounters a vision of his dead son. He determines the entity has not died, so he returns to it. He berates it, then sees as it attempts to transform further.
