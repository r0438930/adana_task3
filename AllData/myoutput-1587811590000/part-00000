Preston cites mentions by Spanish [[conquistadors]] and others. The title of the book derives from four expeditions launched in the 1930s by the Museum of the American Indian (Heye Foundation) in which Honduran informants described to explorers, including [[Theodore Morde]], sensationalized stories of a lost city with a pyramid topped by a giant stone statue of a monkey god somewhere in the Mosquitia region. Preston's book debunks Morde's claim of having found a city.\n\nAfter a privately funded [[lidar]] survey revealed complex archaeological sites under the rainforest cover, Preston accompanied a joint Honduran-American expedition to do [[ground truth]]ing of the lidar results. They were able to confirm the presence of large abandoned [[Pre-Columbian era|prehispanic]] settlements and to document plazas, terracing, canals, roads, earthen structures including a pyramid, and concentrations of artifacts, among them decorated cylindrical stone vessels and [[metate]]s, confirming the existence of an ancient [[city]].
