They were accomplished at the service of King [[Eurystheus]]. The episodes were later connected by a continuous narrative. The establishment of a fixed cycle of twelve labours was attributed by the Greeks to an [[epic poem]], now lost, written by [[Peisander]], dated about 600 BC.<ref>According to [[Walter Burkert]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}</ref> After Heracles killed his wife and children, he went to the oracle at Delphi.

==Backstory==
[[File:P. Oxy. XXII 2331.jpg|thumb|The [[Heracles Papyrus]], a fragment of a 3rd-century Greek manuscript of a poem about the Labours of Heracles ([[Oxyrhynchus Papyrus]] 2331)]]
Driven mad by [[Hera]]  (queen of the gods), Heracles slew his sons by his wife [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]].<ref>Kerényi, p. 186.</ref> After recovering his sanity, Heracles deeply regretted his actions; he was purified by King [[Thespius]], then traveled to [[Delphi]] to inquire how he could atone for his actions. [[Pythia]], the Oracle of Delphi, advised him to go to [[Tiryns]] and serve his cousin, King [[Eurystheus]], for ten years, performing whatever labors Eurystheus might set him; in return, he would be rewarded with immortality. Heracles despaired at this, loathing to serve a man whom he knew to be far inferior to himself, yet fearing to oppose his father [[Zeus]]. Eventually, he placed himself at Eurystheus's disposal.

Eurystheus originally ordered Heracles to perform ten labours. Heracles accomplished these tasks, but Eurystheus refused to recognize two: the slaying of the [[Lernaean Hydra]], as Heracles' nephew and charioteer [[Iolaus]] had helped him; and the cleansing of the [[Augean stables|Augeas]], because Heracles accepted payment for the labour. Eurystheus set two more tasks (fetching the Golden Apples of [[Hesperides]] and capturing [[Cerberus]]), which Heracles also performed, bringing the total number of tasks to twelve.

==Labours==
[[File:Map_of_Heracles's_Early_Labors.jpg|thumb|Heracles's first six labours were located in the [[Peloponnese]].]]

As they survive, the labours of Heracles are not recounted in any single place, but must be reassembled from many sources. Ruck and Staples<ref name=\"ruck\">{{cite book | last = Ruck | first = Carl | author2=Danny Staples | year = 1994 | pages = 169 | title = The World of Classical Myth | location = Durham, North Carolina| publisher = Carolina Academic Press}}</ref> assert that there is no one way to interpret the labours, but that six were located in the [[Peloponnese]], culminating with the rededication of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Six others took the hero farther afield, to places that were, per Ruck, \"all previously strongholds of Hera or the 'Goddess' and were Entrances to the Netherworld\".<ref name=\"ruck\"/> In each case, the pattern was the same: Heracles was sent to kill or subdue, or to fetch back for Eurystheus (as Hera's representative) a magical animal or plant.

A famous depiction of the labours in Greek sculpture is found on the [[metope (architecture)|metopes]] of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, which date to the 450s BC.{{cn|date=March 2020}}
<!-- 
there are no \"fixed\" number of metopes: in the Archaic period, it may actually have been the labours' display on the twelve available metopes on temples which led to their being counted as twelve in number.
-->

In his labours, Heracles was sometimes accompanied by a male companion (an ''[[eromenos]]''), according to [[Licymnius]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and others, such as [[Iolaus]], his nephew. Although he was supposed to perform only ten labours, this assistance led to two labours being disqualified: Eurystheus refused to recognize slaying the Hydra, because Iolaus helped him, and the cleansing of the Augean stables, because Heracles was paid for his services and/or because the rivers did the work. Several of the labours involved the offspring (by various accounts) of [[Typhon]] and his mate [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], all overcome by Heracles.

A traditional order of the labours found in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.1–2.5.12.</ref> by Pseudo-Apollodorus is:
# Slay the [[Nemean lion]].
# Slay the nine-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]].
# Capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]].
# Capture the [[Erymanthian Boar]].
# Clean the [[Augeas|Augean]] stables in a single day.
# Slay the [[Stymphalian birds]].
# Capture the [[Cretan Bull]].
# Steal the [[Mares of Diomedes]].
# Obtain the girdle of [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]].
# Obtain the cattle of the three-bodied giant [[Geryon]].
# Steal three of the golden apples of the [[Hesperides]].
# Capture and bring back [[Cerberus]].

===First: Nemean lion===
{{Main|Nemean lion}}
[[File:Hercules with head of Nemean Lion.jpg|thumb|Hercules with the head of the Nemean lion]]

Heracles wandered the area until he came to the town of [[Cleonae (Argolis)|Cleonae]]. There he met a boy who said that if Heracles slew the Nemean lion and returned alive within 30 days, the town would sacrifice a lion to [[Zeus]], but if he did not return within 30 days or if he died, the boy would sacrifice himself to Zeus. Another version claims that he met Molorchos, a shepherd who had lost his son to the lion, saying that if he came back within 30 days, a ram would be sacrificed to Zeus. If he did not return within 30 days, it would be sacrificed to the dead Heracles as a mourning offering.

While searching for the lion, Heracles fletched some arrows to use against it, not knowing that its golden fur was impenetrable. When he found and shot the lion, firing at it with his bow, he discovered the fur's protective property as the arrow bounced harmlessly off the creature's thigh. After some time, Heracles made the lion return to his cave. The cave had two entrances, one of which Heracles blocked; he then entered the other. In those dark and close quarters, Heracles stunned the beast with his club and, using his immense strength, strangled it to death. During the fight the lion bit off one of his fingers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Ther/LeonNemeios.html|title=NEMEAN LION (Leon Nemeios) - Labour of Heracles in Greek Mythology|website=www.theoi.com}}</ref> Others say that he shot arrows at it, eventually shooting it in the unarmored mouth. After slaying the lion, he tried to skin it with a knife from his belt, but failed. He then tried sharpening the knife with a stone and even tried with the stone itself. Finally, [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, told Heracles to use one of the lion's own claws to skin the pelt. Others say that Heracles' armor was, in fact, the hide of the lion of [[Cithaeron]].

When he returned on the 30th day carrying the carcass of the lion on his shoulders, King Eurystheus was amazed and terrified. Eurystheus forbade him ever again to enter the city; from then on he was to display the fruits of his labours outside the city gates. Eurystheus would then tell Heracles his tasks through a herald, not personally. Eurystheus even had a large bronze jar made for him in which to hide from Heracles if need be. Eurystheus then warned him that the tasks would become increasingly difficult.

===Second: Lernaean Hydra===
{{Main|poop
}}
[[File:Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra.webp|thumb|left|Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra]]
Heracles' second labour was to slay the [[Lernaean Hydra]], which [[Hera]] had raised just to slay Heracles. Upon reaching the swamp near [[Lerna|Lake Lerna]], where the Hydra dwelt, Heracles used a cloth to cover his mouth and nose to protect himself from the poisonous fumes. He fired flaming arrows into the Hydra's lair, the spring of [[Amymone]], a deep cave that it only came out of to terrorize neighboring villages.<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' (angelo) 1959:144.</ref> He then confronted the Hydra, wielding a harvesting [[sickle]] (according to some early vase-paintings), a sword or his famed club. Ruck and Staples (1994: 170) have pointed out that the [[chthonic]] creature's reaction was botanical: upon cutting off each of its heads he found that two grew back, an expression of the hopelessness of such a struggle for any but the [[hero]]. Additionally, one of the Hydra's heads - the middle one - was immortal.

The details of the struggle are explicit in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' (2.5.2): realizing that he could not defeat the Hydra in this way, Heracles called on his nephew [[Iolaus]] for help. His nephew then came upon the idea (possibly inspired by [[Athena]]) of using a firebrand to scorch the neck stumps after each decapitation. Heracles cut off each head and Iolaus cauterized the open stumps. Seeing that Heracles was winning the struggle, Hera sent a giant crab to distract him. He crushed it under his mighty foot. He cut off the Hydra's one immortal head with a golden sword given to him by Athena. Heracles placed it under a great rock on the sacred way between Lerna and Elaius (Kerenyi 1959:144), and dipped his arrows in the Hydra's poisonous blood, and so his second task was complete. The alternative version of this myth is that after cutting off one head, he then dipped his sword in it and used its venom to burn each head so it could not grow back. Hera, upset that Heracles had slain the beast she raised to kill him, placed it in the dark blue vault of the sky as the [[Hydra (constellation)|constellation Hydra]]. She then turned the crab into the [[Cancer (constellation)|constellation Cancer]].

Later, Heracles used an arrow dipped in the Hydra's poisonous blood to kill the centaur [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]]; and Nessus's tainted blood was applied to the [[Tunic of Nessus]], by which the centaur had his posthumous revenge. Both [[Strabo]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] report that the stench of the river Anigrus in [[Elis]], making all the fish of the river inedible, was reputed to be due to the Hydra's venom, washed from the arrows Heracles used on the centaur.<ref>Strabo, viii.3.19, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], v.5.9; Grimal 1987:219.</ref>

===Third: Ceryneian Hind===
{{Main|Ceryneian Hind}}

[[File:Hercules capturing the Ceryneian Hind.webp|thumb|Hercules capturing the Ceryneian Hind]]
Eurystheus and Hera were greatly angered that Heracles had survived the Nemean Lion and the [[Lernaean Hydra]]. For the third labour, they found a task which they thought would spell doom for the hero. It was not slaying a beast or monster, as it had already been established that Heracles could overcome even the most fearsome opponents. Instead, Eurystheus ordered him to capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]], which was so fast that it could outrun an arrow.

After beginning the search, Heracles awoke from sleeping and saw the hind by the glint on its [[antlers]]. Heracles then chased the hind on foot for a full year through [[Greece]], [[Thrace]], [[Istria]], and the land of the [[Hyperboreans]]. In some versions, he captured the hind while it slept, rendering it lame with a trap net. In other versions, he encountered [[Artemis]] in her temple; she told him to leave the hind and tell Eurystheus all that had happened, and his third labor would be considered to be completed. Yet another version claims that Heracles trapped the Hind with an arrow between its forelegs.

Eurystheus had given Heracles this task hoping to incite Artemis' anger at Heracles for his desecration of her sacred animal. As he was returning with the hind, Heracles encountered Artemis and her brother [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]]. He begged the goddess for forgiveness, explaining that he had to catch it as part of his penance, but he promised to return it. Artemis forgave him, foiling Eurystheus' plan to have her punish him.

Upon bringing the hind to Eurystheus, he was told that it was to become part of the King's [[menagerie]]. Heracles knew that he had to return the hind as he had promised, so he agreed to hand it over on the condition that Eurystheus himself come out and take it from him. The King came out, but the moment that Heracles let the hind go, it sprinted back to its mistress and Heracles left, saying that Eurystheus had not been quick enough.

===Fourth: Erymanthian Boar===
{{Main|Erymanthian Boar}}
[[File:Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar.jpg|thumb|left|Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar]]
Eurystheus was disappointed that Heracles had overcome yet another creature and was humiliated by the hind's escape, so he assigned Heracles another dangerous task. By some accounts, the fourth labour was to bring the fearsome [[Erymanthian Boar]] back to Eurystheus alive (there is no single definitive telling of the labours). On the way to Mount Erymanthos where the boar lived, Heracles visited [[Pholus (mythology)|Pholus]] (\"caveman\"), a kind and hospitable [[centaur]] and old friend. Heracles ate with Pholus in his cavern (though the centaur devoured his meat raw) and asked for wine. Pholus had only one jar of wine, a gift from [[Dionysus]] to all the centaurs on Mount Erymanthos. Heracles convinced him to open it, and the smell attracted the other centaurs. They did not understand that wine needs to be tempered with water, became drunk, and attacked Heracles. Heracles shot at them with his poisonous arrows, killing many, and the centaurs retreated all the way to [[Chiron]]'s cave.

Pholus was curious why the arrows caused so much death. He picked one up but dropped it, and the arrow stabbed his hoof, poisoning him. One version states that a stray arrow hit Chiron as well. He was immortal, but he still felt the pain. Chiron's pain was so great that he volunteered to give up his immortality and take the place of [[Prometheus]], who had been chained to the top of a mountain to have his liver eaten daily by an [[eagle]]. Prometheus' torturer, the eagle, continued its torture on Chiron, so Heracles shot it dead with an arrow. It is generally accepted that the tale was meant to show Heracles as being the recipient of Chiron's surrendered immortality. However, this tale contradicts the fact that Chiron later taught [[Achilles]]. The tale of the centaurs sometimes appears in other parts of the twelve labours, as does the freeing of Prometheus.

Heracles had visited Chiron to gain advice on how to catch the boar, and Chiron had told him to drive it into thick snow, which sets this labour in mid-winter. Heracles caught the boar, bound it, and carried it back to Eurystheus, who was frightened of it and ducked down in his half-buried storage ''[[pithos]]'', begging Heracles to get rid of the beast.

===Fifth: Augean stables===
{{Main|Augeas}}

[[File:Hercules cleans the Augean stables by redirecting the rive.jpg|thumb|Hercules cleans the Augean stables by redirecting the river]]
The fifth labour was to clean the stables of King [[Augeas]]. This assignment was intended to be both humiliating (rather than impressive, as the previous labours had been) and impossible, since the livestock were divinely healthy (and immortal) and therefore produced an enormous quantity of dung. The Augean Stables ({{IPAc-en|ɔː|ˈ|dʒ|iː|ə|n}}) had not been cleaned in over 30 years, and over 1,000 cattle lived there. However, Heracles succeeded by re-routing the rivers [[Alfeios River|Alpheus]] and [[Pineios River (Peloponnese)|Peneus]] to wash out the filth.

Before starting on the task, Heracles had asked Augeas for one-tenth of the cattle if he finished the task in one day, and Augeas agreed. But afterwards Augeas refused to honour the agreement on the grounds that Heracles had been ordered to carry out the task by Eurystheus anyway. Heracles claimed his reward in court, and was supported by Augeas' son [[Phyleus]]. Augeas banished them both before the court had ruled. Heracles returned, slew Augeas, and gave his kingdom to Phyleus. Heracles then founded the Olympic Games.
The success of this labour was ultimately discounted as the rushing waters had done the work of cleaning the stables and because Heracles was paid for doing the labour. 
Eurystheus said that Heracles still had seven labours to perform.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://olympusfd.gr/images/Maps/map_us.pdf|title=Maps of Mount Olympus|access-date=2019-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921212448/http://www.olympusfd.gr/images/Maps/map_us.pdf|archive-date=2018-09-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Sixth: Stymphalian birds===
{{Main|Stymphalian birds}}

[[File:Hercules and the Stymphalian Birds.png|thumb|left|Hercules and the Stymphalian birds]]

The sixth labour was to defeat the [[Stymphalian birds]], man-eating birds with beaks made of [[bronze]] and sharp metallic feathers they could launch at their victims. They were sacred to [[Ares]], the god of war. Furthermore, their dung was highly toxic. They had migrated to [[Lake Stymphalia]] in [[Arcadia]], where they bred quickly and took over the countryside, destroying local crops, fruit trees, and townspeople. Heracles could not go too far into the swamp, for it would not support his weight. [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, gave Heracles a rattle which [[Hephaestus]] had made especially for the occasion. Heracles shook the rattle and frightened the birds into the air. Heracles then shot many of them with his arrows. The rest flew far away, never to return. The [[Argonauts]] would later encounter them.

===Seventh: Cretan Bull===
{{Main|Cretan Bull}} 
[[File:Herculean effort.jpg|thumb|upright|Heracles forces the Cretan Bull to the ground ([[engraving]] by B. Picart, 1731)]]

The seventh labour was to capture the [[Cretan Bull]], father of the [[Minotaur]]. Heracles sailed to [[Crete]], where King [[Minos]] gave Heracles permission to take the bull away and even offered him assistance (which Heracles declined, plausibly because he did not want the labor to be discounted as before).<ref name=\"Apollod\">''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.7</ref> The bull had been wreaking havoc on Crete by uprooting crops and leveling orchard walls. Heracles sneaked up behind the bull and then used his hands to throttle it (stopping before it was killed), and then shipped it back to Tiryns. Eurystheus, who hid in his ''[[pithos]]'' at first sight of the creature, wanted to sacrifice the bull to Hera, who hated Heracles. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Heracles. The bull was released and wandered into [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]], becoming known as the Marathonian Bull.<ref name=\"Apollod\" /> [[Theseus]] would later sacrifice the bull to [[Athena]] and/or [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]].

===Eighth: Mares of Diomedes===
{{Main|Mares of Diomedes}}
[[File:Jean Baptiste Marie Pierre - Diomedes King of Thrace Killed by Hercules and Devoured by his own Horses, 1752.jpg|thumb|left|Jean Baptiste Marie Pierre - ''Diomedes King of Thrace Killed by Hercules and Devoured by his own Horses'', 1752]]

In one version, Heracles brought a number of volunteers to help him capture the giant horses<ref name=\":1\" />. After overpowering Diomedes’ men, Heracles broke the chains that tethered the horses and drove the mares down to sea. Unaware that the mares were man-eating and uncontrollable, Heracles left them in the charge of his favored companion, [[Abderus]], while he left to fight Diomedes. Upon his return, Heracles found that the boy was eaten. As revenge, Heracles fed Diomedes to his own horses and then founded [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] next to the boy's tomb<ref name=\":0\" />.

In another version, Heracles, who was visiting the island, stayed awake so that he didn't have his throat cut by Diomedes in the night, and cut the chains binding the horses once everyone was asleep. Having scared the horses onto the high ground of a knoll, Heracles quickly dug a trench through the peninsula, filling it with water and thus flooding the low lying plain. When Diomedes and his men turned to flee, Heracles killed them with an axe (or a club<ref name=\":1\" />), and fed Diomedes’ body to the horses to calm them.

In yet another version, Heracles first captured Diomedes and fed him to the mares ''before'' releasing them. Only after realizing that their King was dead did his men, the [[Bistones|Bistonians]]<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />, attack Heracles. Upon seeing the mares charging at them, led in a chariot by Abderus, the Bistonians turned and fled.

All versions have eating human flesh make the horses calmer, giving Heracles the opportunity to bind their mouths shut, and easily take them back to King Eurystheus, who dedicated the horses to [[Hera]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rose, H.

After the incident, Eurystheus sent Heracles to bring back [[Hippolyta|Hippolyta's Girdle]].

===Ninth: Belt of Hippolyta===
{{Main|Hippolyta}}
[[File:The magic girdle of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons.jpg|thumb|eft|The magic girdle of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons]]
[[Eurystheus]]' daughter [[Admete]] wanted the Belt of [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]], a gift from her father Ares. To please his daughter, Eurystheus ordered Heracles to retrieve the belt as his ninth labour.

Taking a band of friends with him, Heracles set sail, stopping at the island of [[Paros]], which was inhabited by some sons of Minos. The sons killed two of Heracles' companions, an act which set Heracles on a rampage. He killed two of the sons of Minos and threatened the other inhabitants until he was offered two men to replace his fallen companions. Heracles agreed and took two of Minos' grandsons, [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]] and [[Sthenelus]]. They continued their voyage and landed at the court of [[Lycus (mythology)|Lycus]], whom Heracles defended in a battle against King [[Mygdon of Bebryces]]. After killing King Mygdon, Heracles gave much of the land to his friend Lycus. Lycus called the land [[Heraclea Pontica|Heraclea]]. The crew then set off for [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]], where Hippolyta lived.

All would have gone well for Heracles had it not been for Hera. Hippolyta, impressed with Heracles and his exploits, agreed to give him the belt and would have done so had Hera not disguised herself and walked among the Amazons sowing seeds of distrust. She claimed the strangers were plotting to carry off the queen of the Amazons. Alarmed, the women set off on horseback to confront Heracles. When Heracles saw them, he thought Hippolyta had been plotting such treachery all along and had never meant to hand over the belt, so he killed her, took the belt and returned to Eurystheus.

===Tenth: Cattle of Geryon===
{{Main|Geryon}}
[[File:Hercules and the Cattle of Geryones.webp|thumb|Hercules and the Cattle of Geryones]]
The tenth labour was to obtain the Cattle of the three-bodied giant [[Geryon]]. In the fullest account in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus,<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus. ''Bibliotheca'', 2.5.10.</ref> [[Hercules|Heracles]] had to go to the island of Erytheia in the far west (sometimes identified with the [[Hesperides]], or with the island which forms the city of [[Cádiz]]) to get the cattle. On the way there, he crossed the [[Ancient Libya|Libya]]n desert<ref>''Libya'' was the generic name for [[North Africa]] to the Greeks.</ref> and became so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at the [[Sun]]. The sun-god [[Helios]] \"in admiration of his courage\" gave Heracles the golden cup Helios used to sail across the sea from west to east each night. Heracles rode the cup to Erytheia; Heracles in the cup was a favorite motif on [[black-figure pottery]].{{fact|date=March 2020}} Such a magical conveyance undercuts any literal geography for Erytheia, the \"red island\" of the sunset.

When Heracles landed at Erytheia, he was confronted by the two-headed dog [[Orthrus]]. With one blow from his olive-wood club, Heracles killed Orthrus. [[Eurytion]] the herdsman came to assist Orthrus, but Heracles dealt with him the same way.

On hearing the commotion, Geryon sprang into action, carrying three shields and three spears, and wearing three helmets. He attacked Heracles at the River Anthemus, but was slain by one of Heracles' poisoned arrows. Heracles shot so forcefully that the arrow pierced Geryon's forehead, \"and Geryon bent his neck over to one side, like a poppy that spoils its delicate shapes, shedding its petals all at once.\"<ref>[[Stesichorus]], fragment, translated by Denys Page.</ref>

Heracles then had to herd the cattle back to Eurystheus. In [[Roman mythology|Roman]] versions of the narrative, Heracles drove the cattle over the [[Aventine Hill]] on the future site of [[Rome]]. The giant [[Cacus]], who lived there, stole some of the cattle as Heracles slept, making the cattle walk backwards so that they left no trail, a repetition of the trick of the young [[Hermes]]. According to some versions, Heracles drove his remaining cattle past the cave, where Cacus had hidden the stolen animals, and they began calling out to each other. In other versions, Cacus' sister [[Caca (mythology)|Caca]] told Heracles where he was. Heracles then killed Cacus, and set up an altar on the spot, later the site of Rome's [[Forum Boarium]] (the cattle market).

To annoy Heracles, Hera sent a [[Gadfly (mythology)|gadfly]] to bite the cattle, irritate them, and scatter them. Within a year, Heracles retrieved them. Hera then sent a flood which raised the level of a river so much that Heracles could not cross with the cattle. He piled stones into the river to make the water shallower. When he finally reached the court of Eurystheus, the cattle were sacrificed to Hera.

===Eleventh: Golden Apples of the Hesperides===
{{Main|Hesperides}}
[[File:Atlas and Hercules.webp|thumb|left|Atlas and Hercules]]
[[File:Hercules stealing the apples from the Hesperides.webp|thumb|Hercules stealing the apples from the Hesperides]]
After [[Hercules|Heracles]] completed the first ten labours, Eurystheus gave him two more, claiming that slaying the Hydra did not count (because [[Iolaus]] helped Heracles), neither did cleaning the Augean Stables (either because he was paid for the job or because the rivers did the work).

The first additional labour was to steal three of the golden apples from the garden of the [[Hesperides]]. Heracles first caught the [[Old Man of the Sea]], the shapeshifting sea god,<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'', 1959, p.172, identifies him in this context as [[Nereus]]; as a shapeshifter he is often identified as [[Proteus]].</ref> to learn where the Garden of the Hesperides was located.<ref>In some versions of the tale, Hercules was directed to ask [[Prometheus]]. As payment, he freed Prometheus from his daily torture. This tale is more usually found as part of the story of the [[Erymanthian Boar]], since it is associated with [[Chiron]] choosing to forgo immortality and taking Prometheus' place.</ref>

In some variations, Heracles, either at the start or at the end of this task, meets [[Antaeus]], who was invincible as long as he touched his mother, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the Earth. Heracles killed Antaeus by holding him aloft and crushing him in a bear hug.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus ii. 5; [[Hyginus]], ''Fab.'' 31</ref>

[[Herodotus]] claims that Heracles stopped in [[Egypt]], where King [[Busiris (Greek mythology)|Busiris]] decided to make him the yearly sacrifice, but Heracles burst out of his chains.

Heracles finally made his way to the garden of the Hesperides, where he encountered [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] holding up the heavens on his shoulders. Heracles persuaded Atlas to get the three golden Apples for him by offering to hold up the heavens in his place for a little while. Atlas could get the apples because, in this version, he was the father or otherwise related to the Hesperides. This would have made the labour – like the Hydra and the Augean stables – void because Heracles had received help. When Atlas returned, he decided that he did not want to take the heavens back, and instead offered to deliver the apples himself, but Heracles tricked him by agreeing to remain in place of Atlas on the condition that Atlas relieve him temporarily while Heracles adjusted his cloak. Atlas agreed, but Heracles reneged and walked away with the apples. According to an alternative version, Heracles slew [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], the dragon who guarded the apples instead. Eurystheus was furious that Heracles had accomplished something that Eurystheus thought could not possibly be done.

===Twelfth: Cerberus===

{{Main|Cerberus}}

[[File:Hercules and Cerberus.jpg|thumb|Hercules and Cerberus]]

The twelfth and final labour was the capture of [[Cerberus]], the three-headed, dragon-tailed dog that was the guardian of the gates of the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]]. To prepare for his descent into the Underworld, Heracles went to [[Eleusis]] (or [[Athens]]) to be initiated in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. He entered the Underworld, and [[Hermes]] and [[Athena]] were his guides.

While in the Underworld, Heracles met [[Theseus]] and [[Pirithous]]. The two companions had been imprisoned by [[Hades]] for attempting to kidnap [[Persephone]]. One tradition tells of snakes coiling around their legs, then turning into stone; another that Hades feigned hospitality and prepared a feast inviting them to sit. They unknowingly sat in chairs of forgetfulness and were permanently ensnared. When Heracles had pulled Theseus first from his chair, some of his thigh stuck to it (this explains the supposedly lean thighs of Athenians), but the Earth shook at the attempt to liberate Pirithous, whose desire to have the goddess for himself was so insulting he was doomed to stay behind.

Heracles found Hades and asked permission to bring Cerberus to the surface, which Hades agreed to if Heracles could subdue the beast without using weapons. Heracles overpowered Cerberus with his bare hands and slung the beast over his back. He carried Cerberus out of the Underworld through a cavern entrance in the [[Peloponnese]] and brought it to Eurystheus, who again fled into his ''[[pithos]]''.  Eurystheus begged Heracles to return Cerberus to the Underworld, offering in return to release him from any further labours when Cerberus disappeared back to his master.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Jason and the Legendary Golden Fleece by Jean-Francois Detroy.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Jason and the Legendary Golden Fleece'' by Jean-Francois Detroy]]
After completing the Twelve Labours, one tradition says Heracles joined Jason and the [[Argonauts]] in their quest for the [[Golden Fleece]]. However, [[Herodorus]] (c. 400 BC) disputed this and denied Heracles ever sailed with the Argonauts. A separate tradition (e.g. ''[[Argonautica]]'') has Heracles accompany the Argonauts, but he did not travel with them as far as [[Colchis]].

==Allegorical interpretation==
Some ancient Greeks found allegorical meanings of a moral, psychological or philosophical nature in the Labors of Heracles.  This trend became more prominent in the Renaissance.<ref>Brumble, H. David. ''Classical Myths and Legends in the Middle Ages and Renaissance: A Dictionary of Allegorical Meanings''. Routledge, 2013.</ref>  For example, [[Heraclitus_(commentator)|Heraclitus the Grammarian]] wrote in his ''Homeric Problems'':
{{Quote 
|text=
I turn to Heracles. We must not suppose he attained such power in those days as a result of his physical strength. Rather, he was a man of intellect, an initiate in heavenly wisdom, who, as it were, shed light on philosophy, which had been hidden in deep darkness. The most authoritative of the Stoics agree with this account.... The (Erymanthian) boar which he overcame is the common incontinence of men; the (Nemean) lion is the indiscriminate rush towards improper goals; in the same way, by fettering irrational passions he gave rise to the belief that he had fettered the violent (Cretan) bull. He banished cowardice also from the world, in the shape of the hind of Ceryneia. There was another \"labor\" too, not properly so called, in which he cleared out the mass of dung (from the Augean stables) — in other words, the foulness that disfigures humanity. The (Stymphalian) birds he scattered are the windy hopes that feed our lives; the many-headed hydra that he burned, as it were, with the fires of exhortation, is pleasure, which begins to grow again as soon as it is cut out.

They were accomplished at the service of King [[Eurystheus]]. The episodes were later connected by a continuous narrative. The establishment of a fixed cycle of twelve labours was attributed by the Greeks to an [[epic poem]], now lost, written by [[Peisander]], dated about 600 BC.<ref>According to [[Walter Burkert]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}</ref> After Heracles killed his wife and children, he went to the oracle at Delphi. He prayed to the god Apollo for guidance. Heracles was told to serve the king of Mycenae, Eurystheus, for ten years.

==Backstory==
[[File:P. Oxy. XXII 2331.jpg|thumb|The [[Heracles Papyrus]], a fragment of a 3rd-century Greek manuscript of a poem about the Labours of Heracles ([[Oxyrhynchus Papyrus]] 2331)]]
Driven mad by [[Hera]]  (queen of the gods), Heracles slew his sons by his wife [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]].<ref>Kerényi, p. 186.</ref> After recovering his sanity, Heracles deeply regretted his actions; he was purified by King [[Thespius]], then traveled to [[Delphi]] to inquire how he could atone for his actions. [[Pythia]], the Oracle of Delphi, advised him to go to [[Tiryns]] and serve his cousin, King [[Eurystheus]], for ten years, performing whatever labors Eurystheus might set him; in return, he would be rewarded with immortality. Heracles despaired at this, loathing to serve a man whom he knew to be far inferior to himself, yet fearing to oppose his father [[Zeus]]. Eventually, he placed himself at Eurystheus's disposal.

Eurystheus originally ordered Heracles to perform ten labours. Heracles accomplished these tasks, but Eurystheus refused to recognize two: the slaying of the [[Lernaean Hydra]], as Heracles' nephew and charioteer [[Iolaus]] had helped him; and the cleansing of the [[Augean stables|Augeas]], because Heracles accepted payment for the labour. Eurystheus set two more tasks (fetching the Golden Apples of [[Hesperides]] and capturing [[Cerberus]]), which Heracles also performed, bringing the total number of tasks to twelve.

==Labours==
[[File:Map_of_Heracles's_Early_Labors.jpg|thumb|Heracles's first six labours were located in the [[Peloponnese]].]]

As they survive, the labours of Heracles are not recounted in any single place, but must be reassembled from many sources. Ruck and Staples<ref name=\"ruck\">{{cite book | last = Ruck | first = Carl | author2=Danny Staples | year = 1994 | pages = 169 | title = The World of Classical Myth | location = Durham, North Carolina| publisher = Carolina Academic Press}}</ref> assert that there is no one way to interpret the labours, but that six were located in the [[Peloponnese]], culminating with the rededication of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Six others took the hero farther afield, to places that were, per Ruck, \"all previously strongholds of Hera or the 'Goddess' and were Entrances to the Netherworld\".<ref name=\"ruck\"/> In each case, the pattern was the same: Heracles was sent to kill or subdue, or to fetch back for Eurystheus (as Hera's representative) a magical animal or plant.

A famous depiction of the labours in Greek sculpture is found on the [[metope (architecture)|metopes]] of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, which date to the 450s BC.{{cn|date=March 2020}}
<!-- 
there are no \"fixed\" number of metopes: in the Archaic period, it may actually have been the labours' display on the twelve available metopes on temples which led to their being counted as twelve in number.
-->

In his labours, Heracles was sometimes accompanied by a male companion (an ''[[eromenos]]''), according to [[Licymnius]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and others, such as [[Iolaus]], his nephew. Although he was supposed to perform only ten labours, this assistance led to two labours being disqualified: Eurystheus refused to recognize slaying the Hydra, because Iolaus helped him, and the cleansing of the Augean stables, because Heracles was paid for his services and/or because the rivers did the work. Several of the labours involved the offspring (by various accounts) of [[Typhon]] and his mate [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], all overcome by Heracles.

A traditional order of the labours found in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.1–2.5.12.</ref> by Pseudo-Apollodorus is:
# Slay the [[Nemean lion]].
# Slay the nine-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]].
# Capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]].
# Capture the [[Erymanthian Boar]].
# Clean the [[Augeas|Augean]] stables in a single day.
# Slay the [[Stymphalian birds]].
# Capture the [[Cretan Bull]].
# Steal the [[Mares of Diomedes]].
# Obtain the girdle of [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]].
# Obtain the cattle of the three-bodied giant [[Geryon]].
# Steal three of the golden apples of the [[Hesperides]].
# Capture and bring back [[Cerberus]].

===First: Nemean lion===
{{Main|Nemean lion}}
[[File:Hercules with head of Nemean Lion.jpg|thumb|Hercules with the head of the Nemean lion]]

Heracles wandered the area until he came to the town of [[Cleonae (Argolis)|Cleonae]]. There he met a boy who said that if Heracles slew the Nemean lion and returned alive within 30 days, the town would sacrifice a lion to [[Zeus]], but if he did not return within 30 days or if he died, the boy would sacrifice himself to Zeus. Another version claims that he met Molorchos, a shepherd who had lost his son to the lion, saying that if he came back within 30 days, a ram would be sacrificed to Zeus. If he did not return within 30 days, it would be sacrificed to the dead Heracles as a mourning offering.

While searching for the lion, Heracles fletched some arrows to use against it, not knowing that its golden fur was impenetrable. When he found and shot the lion, firing at it with his bow, he discovered the fur's protective property as the arrow bounced harmlessly off the creature's thigh. After some time, Heracles made the lion return to his cave. The cave had two entrances, one of which Heracles blocked; he then entered the other. In those dark and close quarters, Heracles stunned the beast with his club and, using his immense strength, strangled it to death. During the fight the lion bit off one of his fingers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Ther/LeonNemeios.html|title=NEMEAN LION (Leon Nemeios) - Labour of Heracles in Greek Mythology|website=www.theoi.com}}</ref> Others say that he shot arrows at it, eventually shooting it in the unarmored mouth. After slaying the lion, he tried to skin it with a knife from his belt, but failed. He then tried sharpening the knife with a stone and even tried with the stone itself. Finally, [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, told Heracles to use one of the lion's own claws to skin the pelt. Others say that Heracles' armor was, in fact, the hide of the lion of [[Cithaeron]].

When he returned on the 30th day carrying the carcass of the lion on his shoulders, King Eurystheus was amazed and terrified. Eurystheus forbade him ever again to enter the city; from then on he was to display the fruits of his labours outside the city gates. Eurystheus would then tell Heracles his tasks through a herald, not personally. Eurystheus even had a large bronze jar made for him in which to hide from Heracles if need be. Eurystheus then warned him that the tasks would become increasingly difficult.

===Second: Lernaean Hydra===
{{Main|Lernaean Hydra}}
[[File:Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra.webp|thumb|left|Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra]]
Heracles' second labour was to slay the [[Lernaean Hydra]], which [[Hera]] had raised just to slay Heracles. Upon reaching the swamp near [[Lerna|Lake Lerna]], where the Hydra dwelt, Heracles used a cloth to cover his mouth and nose to protect himself from the poisonous fumes. He fired flaming arrows into the Hydra's lair, the spring of [[Amymone]], a deep cave that it only came out of to terrorize neighboring villages.<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' (angelo) 1959:144.</ref> He then confronted the Hydra, wielding a harvesting [[sickle]] (according to some early vase-paintings), a sword or his famed club. Ruck and Staples (1994: 170) have pointed out that the [[chthonic]] creature's reaction was botanical: upon cutting off each of its heads he found that two grew back, an expression of the hopelessness of such a struggle for any but the [[hero]]. Additionally, one of the Hydra's heads - the middle one - was immortal.

The details of the struggle are explicit in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' (2.5.2): realizing that he could not defeat the Hydra in this way, Heracles called on his nephew [[Iolaus]] for help. His nephew then came upon the idea (possibly inspired by [[Athena]]) of using a firebrand to scorch the neck stumps after each decapitation. Heracles cut off each head and Iolaus cauterized the open stumps. Seeing that Heracles was winning the struggle, Hera sent a giant crab to distract him. He crushed it under his mighty foot. He cut off the Hydra's one immortal head with a golden sword given to him by Athena. Heracles placed it under a great rock on the sacred way between Lerna and Elaius (Kerenyi 1959:144), and dipped his arrows in the Hydra's poisonous blood, and so his second task was complete. The alternative version of this myth is that after cutting off one head, he then dipped his sword in it and used its venom to burn each head so it could not grow back. Hera, upset that Heracles had slain the beast she raised to kill him, placed it in the dark blue vault of the sky as the [[Hydra (constellation)|constellation Hydra]]. She then turned the crab into the [[Cancer (constellation)|constellation Cancer]].

Later, Heracles used an arrow dipped in the Hydra's poisonous blood to kill the centaur [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]]; and Nessus's tainted blood was applied to the [[Tunic of Nessus]], by which the centaur had his posthumous revenge. Both [[Strabo]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] report that the stench of the river Anigrus in [[Elis]], making all the fish of the river inedible, was reputed to be due to the Hydra's venom, washed from the arrows Heracles used on the centaur.<ref>Strabo, viii.3.19, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], v.5.9; Grimal 1987:219.</ref>

===Third: Ceryneian Hind===
{{Main|Ceryneian Hind}}

[[File:Hercules capturing the Ceryneian Hind.webp|thumb|Hercules capturing the Ceryneian Hind]]
Eurystheus and Hera were greatly angered that Heracles had survived the Nemean Lion and the [[Lernaean Hydra]]. For the third labour, they found a task which they thought would spell doom for the hero. It was not slaying a beast or monster, as it had already been established that Heracles could overcome even the most fearsome opponents. Instead, Eurystheus ordered him to capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]], which was so fast that it could outrun an arrow.

After beginning the search, Heracles awoke from sleeping and saw the hind by the glint on its [[antlers]]. Heracles then chased the hind on foot for a full year through [[Greece]], [[Thrace]], [[Istria]], and the land of the [[Hyperboreans]]. In some versions, he captured the hind while it slept, rendering it lame with a trap net. In other versions, he encountered [[Artemis]] in her temple; she told him to leave the hind and tell Eurystheus all that had happened, and his third labor would be considered to be completed. Yet another version claims that Heracles trapped the Hind with an arrow between its forelegs.

Eurystheus had given Heracles this task hoping to incite Artemis' anger at Heracles for his desecration of her sacred animal. As he was returning with the hind, Heracles encountered Artemis and her brother [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]]. He begged the goddess for forgiveness, explaining that he had to catch it as part of his penance, but he promised to return it. Artemis forgave him, foiling Eurystheus' plan to have her punish him.

Upon bringing the hind to Eurystheus, he was told that it was to become part of the King's [[menagerie]]. Heracles knew that he had to return the hind as he had promised, so he agreed to hand it over on the condition that Eurystheus himself come out and take it from him. The King came out, but the moment that Heracles let the hind go, it sprinted back to its mistress and Heracles left, saying that Eurystheus had not been quick enough.

===Fourth: Erymanthian Boar===
{{Main|Erymanthian Boar}}
[[File:Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar.jpg|thumb|left|Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar]]
Eurystheus was disappointed that Heracles had overcome yet another creature and was humiliated by the hind's escape, so he assigned Heracles another dangerous task. By some accounts, the fourth labour was to bring the fearsome [[Erymanthian Boar]] back to Eurystheus alive (there is no single definitive telling of the labours). On the way to Mount Erymanthos where the boar lived, Heracles visited [[Pholus (mythology)|Pholus]] (\"caveman\"), a kind and hospitable [[centaur]] and old friend. Heracles ate with Pholus in his cavern (though the centaur devoured his meat raw) and asked for wine. Pholus had only one jar of wine, a gift from [[Dionysus]] to all the centaurs on Mount Erymanthos. Heracles convinced him to open it, and the smell attracted the other centaurs. They did not understand that wine needs to be tempered with water, became drunk, and attacked Heracles. Heracles shot at them with his poisonous arrows, killing many, and the centaurs retreated all the way to [[Chiron]]'s cave.

Pholus was curious why the arrows caused so much death. He picked one up but dropped it, and the arrow stabbed his hoof, poisoning him. One version states that a stray arrow hit Chiron as well. He was immortal, but he still felt the pain. Chiron's pain was so great that he volunteered to give up his immortality and take the place of [[Prometheus]], who had been chained to the top of a mountain to have his liver eaten daily by an [[eagle]]. Prometheus' torturer, the eagle, continued its torture on Chiron, so Heracles shot it dead with an arrow. It is generally accepted that the tale was meant to show Heracles as being the recipient of Chiron's surrendered immortality. However, this tale contradicts the fact that Chiron later taught [[Achilles]]. The tale of the centaurs sometimes appears in other parts of the twelve labours, as does the freeing of Prometheus.

Heracles had visited Chiron to gain advice on how to catch the boar, and Chiron had told him to drive it into thick snow, which sets this labour in mid-winter. Heracles caught the boar, bound it, and carried it back to Eurystheus, who was frightened of it and ducked down in his half-buried storage ''[[pithos]]'', begging Heracles to get rid of the beast.

===Fifth: Augean stables===
{{Main|Augeas}}

[[File:Hercules cleans the Augean stables by redirecting the rive.jpg|thumb|Hercules cleans the Augean stables by redirecting the river]]
The fifth labour was to clean the stables of King [[Augeas]]. This assignment was intended to be both humiliating (rather than impressive, as the previous labours had been) and impossible, since the livestock were divinely healthy (and immortal) and therefore produced an enormous quantity of dung. The Augean Stables ({{IPAc-en|ɔː|ˈ|dʒ|iː|ə|n}}) had not been cleaned in over 30 years, and over 1,000 cattle lived there. However, Heracles succeeded by re-routing the rivers [[Alfeios River|Alpheus]] and [[Pineios River (Peloponnese)|Peneus]] to wash out the filth.

Before starting on the task, Heracles had asked Augeas for one-tenth of the cattle if he finished the task in one day, and Augeas agreed. But afterwards Augeas refused to honour the agreement on the grounds that Heracles had been ordered to carry out the task by Eurystheus anyway. Heracles claimed his reward in court, and was supported by Augeas' son [[Phyleus]]. Augeas banished them both before the court had ruled. Heracles returned, slew Augeas, and gave his kingdom to Phyleus. Heracles then founded the Olympic Games.
The success of this labour was ultimately discounted as the rushing waters had done the work of cleaning the stables and because Heracles was paid for doing the labour. 
Eurystheus said that Heracles still had seven labours to perform.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://olympusfd.gr/images/Maps/map_us.pdf|title=Maps of Mount Olympus|access-date=2019-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921212448/http://www.olympusfd.gr/images/Maps/map_us.pdf|archive-date=2018-09-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Sixth: Stymphalian birds===
{{Main|Stymphalian birds}}

[[File:Hercules and the Stymphalian Birds.png|thumb|left|Hercules and the Stymphalian birds]]

The sixth labour was to defeat the [[Stymphalian birds]], man-eating birds with beaks made of [[bronze]] and sharp metallic feathers they could launch at their victims. They were sacred to [[Ares]], the god of war. Furthermore, their dung was highly toxic. They had migrated to [[Lake Stymphalia]] in [[Arcadia]], where they bred quickly and took over the countryside, destroying local crops, fruit trees, and townspeople. Heracles could not go too far into the swamp, for it would not support his weight. [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, gave Heracles a rattle which [[Hephaestus]] had made especially for the occasion. Heracles shook the rattle and frightened the birds into the air. Heracles then shot many of them with his arrows. The rest flew far away, never to return. The [[Argonauts]] would later encounter them.

===Seventh: Cretan Bull===
{{Main|Cretan Bull}} 
[[File:Herculean effort.jpg|thumb|upright|Heracles forces the Cretan Bull to the ground ([[engraving]] by B. Picart, 1731)]]

The seventh labour was to capture the [[Cretan Bull]], father of the [[Minotaur]]. Heracles sailed to [[Crete]], where King [[Minos]] gave Heracles permission to take the bull away and even offered him assistance (which Heracles declined, plausibly because he did not want the labor to be discounted as before).<ref name=\"Apollod\">''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.7</ref> The bull had been wreaking havoc on Crete by uprooting crops and leveling orchard walls. Heracles sneaked up behind the bull and then used his hands to throttle it (stopping before it was killed), and then shipped it back to Tiryns. Eurystheus, who hid in his ''[[pithos]]'' at first sight of the creature, wanted to sacrifice the bull to Hera, who hated Heracles. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Heracles. The bull was released and wandered into [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]], becoming known as the Marathonian Bull.<ref name=\"Apollod\" /> [[Theseus]] would later sacrifice the bull to [[Athena]] and/or [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]].

===Eighth: Mares of Diomedes===

[[File:Jean Baptiste Marie Pierre - Diomedes King of Thrace Killed by Hercules and Devoured by his own Horses, 1752.jpg|thumb|left|Jean Baptiste Marie Pierre - ''Diomedes King of Thrace Killed by Hercules and Devoured by his own Horses'', 1752]]

In one version, Heracles brought a number of volunteers to help him capture the giant horses<ref name=\":1\" />. After overpowering Diomedes’ men, Heracles broke the chains that tethered the horses and drove the mares down to sea. Unaware that the mares were man-eating and uncontrollable, Heracles left them in the charge of his favored companion, [[Abderus]], while he left to fight Diomedes. Upon his return, Heracles found that the boy was eaten. As revenge, Heracles fed Diomedes to his own horses and then founded [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] next to the boy's tomb<ref name=\":0\" />.

In another version, Heracles, who was visiting the island, stayed awake so that he didn't have his throat cut by Diomedes in the night, and cut the chains binding the horses once everyone was asleep. Having scared the horses onto the high ground of a knoll, Heracles quickly dug a trench through the peninsula, filling it with water and thus flooding the low lying plain. When Diomedes and his men turned to flee, Heracles killed them with an axe (or a club<ref name=\":1\" />), and fed Diomedes’ body to the horses to calm them.

In yet another version, Heracles first captured Diomedes and fed him to the mares ''before'' releasing them. Only after realizing that their King was dead did his men, the [[Bistones|Bistonians]]<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />, attack Heracles. Upon seeing the mares charging at them, led in a chariot by Abderus, the Bistonians turned and fled.

All versions have eating human flesh make the horses calmer, giving Heracles the opportunity to bind their mouths shut, and easily take them back to King Eurystheus, who dedicated the horses to [[Hera]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rose, H.

After the incident, Eurystheus sent Heracles to bring back [[Hippolyta|Hippolyta's Girdle]].

===Ninth: Belt of Hippolyta===
{{Main|Hippolyta}}
[[File:The magic girdle of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons.jpg|thumb|eft|The magic girdle of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons]]
[[Eurystheus]]' daughter [[Admete]] wanted the Belt of [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]], a gift from her father Ares. To please his daughter, Eurystheus ordered Heracles to retrieve the belt as his ninth labour.

Taking a band of friends with him, Heracles set sail, stopping at the island of [[Paros]], which was inhabited by some sons of Minos. The sons killed two of Heracles' companions, an act which set Heracles on a rampage. He killed two of the sons of Minos and threatened the other inhabitants until he was offered two men to replace his fallen companions. Heracles agreed and took two of Minos' grandsons, [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]] and [[Sthenelus]]. They continued their voyage and landed at the court of [[Lycus (mythology)|Lycus]], whom Heracles defended in a battle against King [[Mygdon of Bebryces]]. After killing King Mygdon, Heracles gave much of the land to his friend Lycus. Lycus called the land [[Heraclea Pontica|Heraclea]]. The crew then set off for [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]], where Hippolyta lived.

All would have gone well for Heracles had it not been for Hera. Hippolyta, impressed with Heracles and his exploits, agreed to give him the belt and would have done so had Hera not disguised herself and walked among the Amazons sowing seeds of distrust. She claimed the strangers were plotting to carry off the queen of the Amazons. Alarmed, the women set off on horseback to confront Heracles. When Heracles saw them, he thought Hippolyta had been plotting such treachery all along and had never meant to hand over the belt, so he killed her, took the belt and returned to Eurystheus.

===Tenth: Cattle of Geryon===
{{Main|Geryon}}
[[File:Hercules and the Cattle of Geryones.webp|thumb|Hercules and the Cattle of Geryones]]
The tenth labour was to obtain the Cattle of the three-bodied giant [[Geryon]]. In the fullest account in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus,<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus. ''Bibliotheca'', 2.5.10.</ref> [[Hercules|Heracles]] had to go to the island of Erytheia in the far west (sometimes identified with the [[Hesperides]], or with the island which forms the city of [[Cádiz]]) to get the cattle. On the way there, he crossed the [[Ancient Libya|Libya]]n desert<ref>''Libya'' was the generic name for [[North Africa]] to the Greeks.</ref> and became so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at the [[Sun]]. The sun-god [[Helios]] \"in admiration of his courage\" gave Heracles the golden cup Helios used to sail across the sea from west to east each night. Heracles rode the cup to Erytheia; Heracles in the cup was a favorite motif on [[black-figure pottery]].{{fact|date=March 2020}} Such a magical conveyance undercuts any literal geography for Erytheia, the \"red island\" of the sunset.

When Heracles landed at Erytheia, he was confronted by the two-headed dog [[Orthrus]]. With one blow from his olive-wood club, Heracles killed Orthrus. [[Eurytion]] the herdsman came to assist Orthrus, but Heracles dealt with him the same way.

On hearing the commotion, Geryon sprang into action, carrying three shields and three spears, and wearing three helmets. He attacked Heracles at the River Anthemus, but was slain by one of Heracles' poisoned arrows. Heracles shot so forcefully that the arrow pierced Geryon's forehead, \"and Geryon bent his neck over to one side, like a poppy that spoils its delicate shapes, shedding its petals all at once.\"<ref>[[Stesichorus]], fragment, translated by Denys Page.</ref>

Heracles then had to herd the cattle back to Eurystheus. In [[Roman mythology|Roman]] versions of the narrative, Heracles drove the cattle over the [[Aventine Hill]] on the future site of [[Rome]]. The giant [[Cacus]], who lived there, stole some of the cattle as Heracles slept, making the cattle walk backwards so that they left no trail, a repetition of the trick of the young [[Hermes]]. According to some versions, Heracles drove his remaining cattle past the cave, where Cacus had hidden the stolen animals, and they began calling out to each other. In other versions, Cacus' sister [[Caca (mythology)|Caca]] told Heracles where he was. Heracles then killed Cacus, and set up an altar on the spot, later the site of Rome's [[Forum Boarium]] (the cattle market).

To annoy Heracles, Hera sent a [[Gadfly (mythology)|gadfly]] to bite the cattle, irritate them, and scatter them. Within a year, Heracles retrieved them. Hera then sent a flood which raised the level of a river so much that Heracles could not cross with the cattle. He piled stones into the river to make the water shallower. When he finally reached the court of Eurystheus, the cattle were sacrificed to Hera.

===Eleventh: Golden Apples of the Hesperides===
{{Main|Hesperides}}
[[File:Atlas and Hercules.webp|thumb|left|Atlas and Hercules]]
[[File:Hercules stealing the apples from the Hesperides.webp|thumb|Hercules stealing the apples from the Hesperides]]
After [[Hercules|Heracles]] completed the first ten labours, Eurystheus gave him two more, claiming that slaying the Hydra did not count (because [[Iolaus]] helped Heracles), neither did cleaning the Augean Stables (either because he was paid for the job or because the rivers did the work).

The first additional labour was to steal three of the golden apples from the garden of the [[Hesperides]]. Heracles first caught the [[Old Man of the Sea]], the shapeshifting sea god,<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'', 1959, p.172, identifies him in this context as [[Nereus]]; as a shapeshifter he is often identified as [[Proteus]].</ref> to learn where the Garden of the Hesperides was located.<ref>In some versions of the tale, Hercules was directed to ask [[Prometheus]]. As payment, he freed Prometheus from his daily torture. This tale is more usually found as part of the story of the [[Erymanthian Boar]], since it is associated with [[Chiron]] choosing to forgo immortality and taking Prometheus' place.</ref>

In some variations, Heracles, either at the start or at the end of this task, meets [[Antaeus]], who was invincible as long as he touched his mother, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the Earth. Heracles killed Antaeus by holding him aloft and crushing him in a bear hug.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus ii. 5; [[Hyginus]], ''Fab.'' 31</ref>

[[Herodotus]] claims that Heracles stopped in [[Egypt]], where King [[Busiris (Greek mythology)|Busiris]] decided to make him the yearly sacrifice, but Heracles burst out of his chains.

Heracles finally made his way to the garden of the Hesperides, where he encountered [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] holding up the heavens on his shoulders. Heracles persuaded Atlas to get the three golden Apples for him by offering to hold up the heavens in his place for a little while. Atlas could get the apples because, in this version, he was the father or otherwise related to the Hesperides. This would have made the labour – like the Hydra and the Augean stables – void because Heracles had received help. When Atlas returned, he decided that he did not want to take the heavens back, and instead offered to deliver the apples himself, but Heracles tricked him by agreeing to remain in place of Atlas on the condition that Atlas relieve him temporarily while Heracles adjusted his cloak. Atlas agreed, but Heracles reneged and walked away with the apples. According to an alternative version, Heracles slew [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], the dragon who guarded the apples instead. Eurystheus was furious that Heracles had accomplished something that Eurystheus thought could not possibly be done.

===Twelfth: Cerberus===

{{Main|Cerberus}}

[[File:Hercules and Cerberus.jpg|thumb|Hercules and Cerberus]]

The twelfth and final labour was the capture of [[Cerberus]], the three-headed, dragon-tailed dog that was the guardian of the gates of the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]]. To prepare for his descent into the Underworld, Heracles went to [[Eleusis]] (or [[Athens]]) to be initiated in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. He entered the Underworld, and [[Hermes]] and [[Athena]] were his guides.

While in the Underworld, Heracles met [[Theseus]] and [[Pirithous]]. The two companions had been imprisoned by [[Hades]] for attempting to kidnap [[Persephone]]. One tradition tells of snakes coiling around their legs, then turning into stone; another that Hades feigned hospitality and prepared a feast inviting them to sit. They unknowingly sat in chairs of forgetfulness and were permanently ensnared. When Heracles had pulled Theseus first from his chair, some of his thigh stuck to it (this explains the supposedly lean thighs of Athenians), but the Earth shook at the attempt to liberate Pirithous, whose desire to have the goddess for himself was so insulting he was doomed to stay behind.

Heracles found Hades and asked permission to bring Cerberus to the surface, which Hades agreed to if Heracles could subdue the beast without using weapons. Heracles overpowered Cerberus with his bare hands and slung the beast over his back. He carried Cerberus out of the Underworld through a cavern entrance in the [[Peloponnese]] and brought it to Eurystheus, who again fled into his ''[[pithos]]''.  Eurystheus begged Heracles to return Cerberus to the Underworld, offering in return to release him from any further labours when Cerberus disappeared back to his master.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Jason and the Legendary Golden Fleece by Jean-Francois Detroy.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Jason and the Legendary Golden Fleece'' by Jean-Francois Detroy]]
After completing the Twelve Labours, one tradition says Heracles joined Jason and the [[Argonauts]] in their quest for the [[Golden Fleece]]. However, [[Herodorus]] (c. 400 BC) disputed this and denied Heracles ever sailed with the Argonauts. A separate tradition (e.g. ''[[Argonautica]]'') has Heracles accompany the Argonauts, but he did not travel with them as far as [[Colchis]].

==Allegorical interpretation==
Some ancient Greeks found allegorical meanings of a moral, psychological or philosophical nature in the Labors of Heracles.  This trend became more prominent in the Renaissance.<ref>Brumble, H. David. ''Classical Myths and Legends in the Middle Ages and Renaissance: A Dictionary of Allegorical Meanings''. Routledge, 2013.</ref>  For example, [[Heraclitus_(commentator)|Heraclitus the Grammarian]] wrote in his ''Homeric Problems'':
{{Quote 
|text=
I turn to Heracles. We must not suppose he attained such power in those days as a result of his physical strength. Rather, he was a man of intellect, an initiate in heavenly wisdom, who, as it were, shed light on philosophy, which had been hidden in deep darkness. The most authoritative of the Stoics agree with this account.... The (Erymanthian) boar which he overcame is the common incontinence of men; the (Nemean) lion is the indiscriminate rush towards improper goals; in the same way, by fettering irrational passions he gave rise to the belief that he had fettered the violent (Cretan) bull. He banished cowardice also from the world, in the shape of the hind of Ceryneia. There was another \"labor\" too, not properly so called, in which he cleared out the mass of dung (from the Augean stables) — in other words, the foulness that disfigures humanity. The (Stymphalian) birds he scattered are the windy hopes that feed our lives; the many-headed hydra that he burned, as it were, with the fires of exhortation, is pleasure, which begins to grow again as soon as it is cut out.

[[File:Colfax Riot sign IMG 2401.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Colfax Riot [[historical marker]] (1950) in Colfax refers to \"[[carpetbagger|carpetbag]] misrule in the [[American South|South]].\"]]

The '''Colfax massacre''', or '''Colfax riot''' as the events are termed on the 1950 state historic marker, occurred on [[Easter Sunday]], April 13, 1873, in [[Colfax, Louisiana]], the seat of [[Grant Parish, Louisiana|Grant Parish]], where approximately 150 black men were murdered by white Southerners who had formed a militia. Three white men died in the confrontation, with at least one said to have been shot by his own side. 

In the wake of the contested 1872 election for [[governor of Louisiana]] and local offices, a group of white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] armed with rifles and a small cannon, overpowered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[freedmen]] and state [[militia]] (also black) occupying the Grant Parish [[courthouse]] in Colfax.<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\">[[Eric Foner]], ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877'', p. 437</ref><ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/grant/peopleevents/e_colfax.html ''Ulysses S. Grant'', People and Events: \"The Colfax Massacre\", PBS Website], accessed Apr 6, 2008</ref> Most of the [[freedmen]] were killed after they surrendered; nearly 50 were killed later that night after being held as prisoners for several hours. Estimates of the number of dead have varied, ranging from 62 to 153; three whites died but the number of black victims was difficult to determine because many bodies were thrown into the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] or removed for burial. There were rumors of mass graves at the site.

Historian [[Eric Foner]] described the massacre as the worst instance of racial violence during Reconstruction.<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/> In Louisiana, it had the most fatalities of any of the numerous violent events following the disputed gubernatorial contest in 1872 between [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Foner wrote, \"...every election [in Louisiana] between 1868 and 1876 was marked by rampant violence and pervasive fraud.\"<ref name=\"Eric Foner 1989, p. 550\">Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877'', New York: Perennial Library, 1989, p. 550</ref> Although the [[Electoral fusion|Fusionist]]-dominated state \"returning board,\" which ruled on vote validity, initially declared [[John McEnery (Louisiana)|John McEnery]] and his Democratic slate the winners, the board eventually split, with a faction declaring Republican [[William P. Kellogg]] the victor. A Republican federal judge in New Orleans ruled that the Republican-majority legislature be seated.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=b13}}</ref>

Federal prosecution and conviction of a few perpetrators at Colfax under the [[Enforcement Acts]] was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In a key case, the court ruled in ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876) that protections of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] did not apply to the actions of individuals, but only to the actions of state governments. After this ruling, the federal government could no longer use the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]] to prosecute actions by [[paramilitary organizations|paramilitary groups]] such as the [[White League]], which had chapters forming across Louisiana beginning in 1874. Intimidation, murders, and black voter suppression by such paramilitary groups were instrumental to the Democratic Party regaining political control in the state legislature by the late 1870s.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, historians have paid renewed attention to the events at Colfax and the resulting Supreme Court case, and their meaning in American history.

==State and national background==

In March 1865, Unionist planter [[James Madison Wells]] became governor. As the Democratic-dominated legislature passed Black Codes that restricted rights of freedmen, Wells began to lean toward allowing blacks to vote and temporarily [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] ex-Confederates. To accomplish this, he scheduled a new constitutional convention for July 30, 1866.<ref>{{Cite book|title=By One Vote|last=Holt|first=Michael|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2008|isbn=|location=Lawrence, Kansas|pages=195–96}}</ref>

It was postponed because of the [[New Orleans Massacre]] that day, in which armed Southern white Democrats attacked blacks who had a parade in support of the convention. Anticipating trouble, the mayor of New Orleans had asked the local military commander to police the city and protect the convention. The U. S. Army failed to promptly respond to the mayor's request and a group of numerous unarmed blacks was attacked by whites, resulting in 38 deaths: 34 black and four white; and more than 40 wounded, most of them black.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reconstruction|last=Craven|first=Avery|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=1969|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=186–87}}</ref> 

When President [[Andrew Johnson]] blamed the [[massacre]] on Republican agitation, a popular national backlash against Johnson's policies led to national voters electing a majority Republican Congress in 1866. It passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] over Andrew Johnson's veto. Earlier the Freedmen's Bureau and the occupation armies had prevented Southern [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]], which had limited the rights of freedmen and other blacks, (including their choices of work and living locations) from going into effect.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of the South|last=Simkins|first=Francis|last2=Roland|first2=Charles|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1947|isbn=|location=New York|pages=262}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The South Since 1865|last=Ezell|first=John|publisher=Macmilan|year=1975|isbn=|location=New York|pages=47–8}}</ref> On July 16, 1866, Congress extended the life of the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], also over Johnson's veto. On March 2, 1867, they passed the [[Reconstruction Act]], over Johnson's veto, which required that blacks be given the franchise—in Southern states but not in Northern states—and that reconstructed Southern states ratify the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] before admission to the Union.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Civil War and Reconstruction|last=Randall|first=J.

By April 1868, a biracial coalition in Louisiana had elected a Republican-majority state legislature but violence increased before the fall election. Almost all of the victims were black and some white Republicans who were protecting the black Republican freedmen. Insurgents also attacked men physically or burned their homes to discourage them from voting. President Johnson, a Democrat, prevented the Republican governor of Louisiana from using either the state militia or U.S. forces to suppress the insurgent groups, such as the [[Knights of the White Camelia]].<ref name=\"Lane\">{{harvnb|Lane|2008}}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

According to Lane, after [[Ulysses S. Grant]] became President in 1869, he \"lobbied hard for the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]\" (ratified February 3, 1870),<ref> Lane 2008, p. 1f </ref> which guaranteed that blacks, most of whom were newly freed slaves, would have full citizenship and suffrage.{{cn|date=June 2019}} The [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), and other insurgent groups{{cn|date=June 2019}}, continued violent attacks and killed scores of blacks in [[Arkansas]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Mississippi]] and elsewhere,<ref> Lane 2008, p. 3f </ref> to discourage their voting in the 1870 elections.{{cn|date=June 2019}} On May 31, 1870, Congress passed an [[Enforcement Act]] based on the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] and Fifteenth amendments.<ref name=Lane_p4> Lane 2008, p. 4 </ref> They followed this with the [[Ku Klux Klan Act]], enacted April 20, 1871, which  Grant used to suspend the writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and use the \"army to round up Klansmen and present them for trial in federal court\".<ref name=Lane_p4/>

==Louisiana and Grant Parish==
Governor [[Henry Clay Warmoth]] struggled to maintain political balance in Louisiana. Among his appointments, he installed William Ward, a black [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] veteran, as commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, a new unit to be based in Grant Parish to help control the violence there and in other Red River parishes. Ward, born a slave in 1840 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], had learned to read and write as a valet to a master in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. In 1864 he escaped and went to [[Fortress Monroe]], where he joined the [[Union Army]] and served until after General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender. About 1870 he came to Grant Parish, where he had a friend. He quickly became active among local blacks in the Republican Party. After his appointment to the militia, Ward recruited other freedmen for his forces, several of whom were veterans of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|pp=54–56}}</ref>

==Louisiana election of 1872==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}
In Louisiana, Republican governor [[Henry Clay Warmoth]] defected from the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republicans]] (a group that opposed President Grant's [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]) policies in 1872. Warmoth previously supported a constitutional amendment that allowed former Confederates, who had been denied the right to vote, to be re-enfranchised. A \"Fusionist\" coalition of Liberal Republicans and Democrats nominated ex-Confederate battalion commander and Democrat [[John McEnery (politician)|John McEnery]] to succeed him as governor. In return, Democrats and Liberal Republicans were to send Warmoth to Washington as a [[U.S. Senator]]. Opposing McEnery was Republican [[William Pitt Kellogg]], one of Louisiana's U.S. Senators. Voting on November 4, 1872, resulted in dual governments, as a Fusionist (Liberal Republicans and Democrat)-dominated returning board declared McEnery the winner while a faction of the board proclaimed Kellogg the winner. Both administrations held inaugural ceremonies and certified their lists of local candidates.

After failing to win their case in state court, the Kellogg forces appealed to federal judge Edward Durell in [[New Orleans]] to intervene and order that Kellogg and the Stalwart Republican-majority legislature were to be seated, and for Grant to authorize U.S. army troops to protect Kellogg's government. This action was widely criticized across the nation by Democrats and both wings of the Republican Party because it was considered to be a violation of the rights of states to manage their own (non-federal-office) elections. Thus, investigating committees of both chambers of the federal Congress in Washington were critical of the Kellogg choice. The House majority ruled Durell's action illegal and the Senate majority concluded that the Kellogg regime was \"not much better than a successful conspiracy.\" In 1874 a House investigating committee in Washington recommended that Judge Durell be impeached for corruption and illegally interfering in the Louisiana 1872 state elections, but the judge resigned in order to avoid impeachment.<ref>William Hesseltine, \"Grant the Politician\", 344</ref><ref>Charles Lane, *The Green Bag*, \"Edward Henry Durell,\" 167-68</ref>

McEnery's faction tried to take control of the state arsenal at [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]], but Kellogg had the state militia seize dozens of leaders of McEnery's faction and control New Orleans, where the state government was located.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}} McEnery returned to try to take control with a private paramilitary group. In September 1873 his forces, over 8,000 strong, entered the city and defeated the city/state militia of about 3500 in New Orleans. The Democrats took control of the state house, armory and police stations, where the state government was then located, in what was known as the Battle of Jackson Square. His forces held those buildings for three days before retreating before Federal troops arrived.<ref name=\"Eric Foner 1989, p. 550\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=General James Longstreet|last=Wert|first=Jeffry|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=416}}</ref> Warmoth was subsequently impeached by the state legislature in a bribery scandal stemming from his actions in the 1872 election.

Warmoth appointed Democrats as parish registrars, and they ensured the voter rolls included as many whites and as few freedmen as possible. A number of registrars changed the registration site without notifying blacks. They also required blacks to prove they were over 21, while knowing that former slaves did not have birth certificates. In Grant Parish, one plantation owner threatened to expel blacks from homes they rented on his land if they voted Republican. Fusionists also tampered with ballot boxes on election day. One was found with a hole in it, apparently used for stuffing the ballot box. As a result, Grant Parish Fusionists claimed a landslide victory, even though black voters outnumbered whites by 776 to 630.

Warmoth issued commissions to Fusionist Democrats Alphonse Cazabat and [[Christopher Columbus Nash]], elected parish judge and sheriff, respectively. Like many white men in the South, Nash was a Confederate veteran (as an officer, he had been held for a year and a half as a [[prisoner of war]] at [[Johnson's Island]] in [[Ohio]]). Cazabat and Nash took their oaths of office in the Colfax courthouse on January 2, 1873. They dispatched the documents to Governor McEnery in New Orleans.

William Pitt Kellogg issued commissions to the Republican slate for Grant Parish on January 17 and 18. By then Nash and Cazabat controlled the small, primitive courthouse. Republican Robert C. Register insisted that he, not Alphonse Cazabat, was the parish judge and that Republican Daniel Wesley Shaw, not Nash, was to be the sheriff. On the night of March 25, the Republicans seized the empty courthouse and took their oaths of office. They sent their oaths to the Kellogg administration in New Orleans.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

Grant Parish was one of a number of new parishes created by the Republican government in an effort to build local support in the state. Both the land and its people were originally tied to the Calhoun family, whose plantation had covered more than the borders of the new parish. The freedmen had been slaves on the plantation. The parish also took in the less-developed hill country. The total population had a narrow majority of 2400 freedmen, who mostly voted Republican, and 2200 whites, who voted as Democrats. Statewide political tensions were reflected in the rumors going around each community, often about white fears of black attacks or outrage, which added to local tensions.<ref name=\"libertychapelcemetery.org\">[http://www.libertychapelcemetery.org/files/hogue-colfax.pdf James K.

==Colfax courthouse conflict==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}
Fearful that the Democrats might try to take over the local parish government, blacks started to create trenches around the courthouse and drilled to keep alert. The Republican officeholders stayed there overnight. They held the town for three weeks.<ref>{{cite book

On March 28, Nash, Cazabat, Hadnot and other white Fusionists called for armed whites to retake the courthouse on April 1. Whites were recruited from nearby Winn and surrounding parishes to join their effort. The Republicans Shaw, Register, and Flowers and others began to collect a posse of armed blacks to defend the courthouse.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

Black Republicans Lewis Meekins and state militia captain William Ward, a black [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] veteran, raided the homes of the opposition leaders: Judge William R. Rutland, Bill Cruikshank, and Jim Hadnot. Gunfire erupted between whites and blacks on April 2 and again on April 5, but the shotguns were too inaccurate to do any harm. The two sides arranged for peace negotiations. Peace ended when a white man shot and killed a black man named Jesse McKinney, described as a bystander. Another armed conflict on April 6 ended with whites fleeing from armed blacks.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 154</ref> With all the unrest in the community, black women and children joined the men at the courthouse for protection.

William Ward, the commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, headquartered in Grant Parish, had been elected state representative from the parish on the Republican ticket.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=56}}</ref> He wrote to Governor Kellogg seeking U.S. troops for reinforcement and gave the letter to William Smith Calhoun for delivery. Calhoun took the steamboat ''LaBelle'' down the Red River but was captured by Paul Hooe, Hadnot, and Cruikshank. They ordered Calhoun to tell blacks to leave the courthouse.

The black defenders refused to leave although threatened by parties of armed whites commanded by Nash. To recruit men during the rising political tensions, Nash had contributed to lurid rumors that blacks were preparing to kill all the white men and take the white women as their own.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/colfaxmassacreun00keit/page/117 Keith (2007), ''The Colfax Massacre''], p. 117</ref> On April 8 the anti-Republican ''[[Daily Picayune]]'' newspaper of New Orleans inflamed tensions and distorted events by the following headline: 

{{quote|THE RIOT IN GRANT PARISH. FEARFUL ATROCITIES BY THE NEGROES. NO RESPECT SHOWN TO THE DEAD.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=84}}</ref>}}

Such news attracted more whites from the region to Grant Parish to join Nash; all were experienced Confederate veterans. They acquired a four-pound cannon that could fire iron slugs. As the Klansman Dave Paul said, \"Boys, this is a struggle for [[white supremacy]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=91}}</ref>

Suffering from [[tuberculosis]] and [[rheumatism]], on April 11 the militia captain Ward took a steamboat downriver to New Orleans to seek armed help directly from Kellogg. He was not there for the following events.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=57}}</ref>

==Massacre==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}
Cazabat had directed Nash as sheriff to put down what he called a riot. Nash gathered an armed white [[paramilitary]] group and veteran officers from [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides]], [[Winn Parish, Louisiana|Winn]] and [[Catahoula Parish, Louisiana|Catahoula]] parishes. He did not move his forces toward the courthouse until noon on Easter Sunday, April 13. Nash led more than 300 armed white men, most on horseback and armed with rifles. Nash reportedly ordered the defenders of the courthouse to leave. When that failed, Nash gave women and children camped outside the courthouse thirty minutes to clear out. After they left, the shooting began. The fighting continued for several hours with few casualties. When Nash's paramilitary maneuvered the cannon behind the building, some of the defenders panicked and left the courthouse.

About 60 defenders ran into nearby woods and jumped into the river. Nash sent men on horseback after the fleeing black Republicans, and his paramilitary group killed most of them on the spot. Soon Nash's forces directed a black captive to set the courthouse roof on fire. The defenders displayed [[white flag]]s for surrender: one made from a shirt, the other from a page of a book. The shooting stopped.

Nash's group approached and called for those surrendering to throw down their weapons and come outside. What happened next is in dispute. According to the reports of some whites, James Hadnot was shot and wounded by someone from the courthouse. \"In the Negro version, the men in the courthouse were stacking their guns when the white men approached, and Hadnot was shot from behind by an overexcited member of his own force.\"<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paperback, 2007, p.18</ref> Hadnot died later, after being taken downstream by a passing steamboat.<ref>Lemann (2007), ''Redemption,'' p. 18</ref>

In the aftermath of Hadnot's shooting, the white paramilitary group reacted with mass murders of the black men. As more than 40 times as many blacks died as did whites, historians describe the event as a massacre. The white paramilitary group killed unarmed men trying to hide in the courthouse. They rode down and killed those attempting to flee. They dumped some bodies in the Red River. About 50 blacks survived the afternoon and were taken prisoner. Later that night they were summarily killed by their captors, who had been drinking. Only one black from the group, Levi Nelson, survived. He was shot by Cruikshank but managed to crawl away unnoticed. He later served as one of the Federal government's chief witnesses against those who were [[Indictment|indicted]] for the attacks.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=124}}</ref>

Kellogg sent state militia colonels Theodore DeKlyne and William Wright to Colfax with warrants to arrest 50 white men and to install a new, compromise slate of parish officers. DeKlyne and Wright found the smoking ruins of the courthouse at Colfax, and many bodies of men who had been shot in the back of the head or the neck. They described that one body was charred, another man's head was beaten beyond recognition, and another had a slashed throat. Surviving blacks told DeKlyne and Wright that blacks dug a trench around the courthouse to protect it from what they saw as an attempt by white Democrats to steal an election. They were attacked by whites armed with rifles, revolvers and a small cannon. When blacks refused to leave, the courthouse was burned, and the black defenders were shot down. While the whites accused blacks of violating a flag of truce and rioting, black Republicans said that none of this was true. They accused whites of marching captured prisoners away in pairs and shooting them in the back of the head.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

On April 14 some of Governor Kellogg's new police force arrived from New Orleans. Several days later, two companies of Federal troops arrived. They searched for white paramilitary members, but many had already fled to [[Texas]] or the hills. The officers filed a military report in which they identified by name three whites and 105 blacks who had died, plus noted they had recovered 15-20 unidentified blacks from the river. They also noted the savage nature of many of the killings, suggesting an out-of-control situation.<ref name=\"ftp.rootsweb.com\">[http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/la/state/history/military/uncat/colfaxr.txt \"Military Report on Colfax Riot, 1875\"], ''Congressional Record''], accessed Apr 6, 2008</ref>

The historian Eric Foner, a specialist in the Civil War and Reconstruction, wrote about the event:

{{quote|The bloodiest single instance of racial carnage in the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]], the Colfax massacre taught many lessons, including the lengths to which some opponents of Reconstruction would go to regain their accustomed authority. Among blacks in Louisiana, the incident was long remembered as proof that in any large confrontation, they stood at a fatal disadvantage.<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/>}}

<blockquote>\"The organization against them is too strong. ...\" Louisiana black teacher and Reconstruction legislator [[John G. Lewis]] later remarked. \"They attempted [armed self-defense] in Colfax. The result was that on [[Easter Sunday]] of 1873 when the sun went down that night, it went down on the corpses of two hundred and eighty negroes.\"<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/></blockquote>

==Aftermath==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}
[[James Roswell Beckwith]], the US Attorney based in New Orleans, sent an urgent telegram about the massacre to the [[Attorney General of the United States|U.S. Attorney General]]. The massacre in Colfax gained headlines of national newspapers from [[Boston]] to [[Chicago]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=22}}</ref> Various government forces spent weeks trying to round up members of the white paramilitaries, and a total of 97 men were indicted. In the end, Beckwith charged nine men and brought them to trial for violations of the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]]. It had been designed to provide federal protection for [[civil rights]] of freedmen under the [[14th Amendment of the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] against actions by [[terrorist]] groups such as the Klan.

The men were charged with one murder, and charges related to a conspiracy against the rights of freedmen. There were two succeeding trials in 1874. [[William Burnham Woods]] presided over the first trial and was sympathetic to the prosecution. Had the men been convicted, they would not have been able to appeal their decision to any appellate court according to the laws of the time. However, Beckworth was unable to secure a conviction—one man was acquitted, and a mistrial was declared in the cases of the other eight. 

In the second trial, three men were found guilty of sixteen charges. However, the presiding judge, [[Joseph Bradley]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]] ([[circuit justice|riding circuit]]), dismissed the convictions, ruling that the charges violated the [[state actor]] doctrine, failed to prove a racial rationale for the massacre, or were [[void for vagueness]]. ''[[Sua sponte]]'', he ordered that the men be released on bail, and they promptly disappeared.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York; Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2006, p.25</ref>

When the federal government appealed the case, it was heard by the US Supreme Court as ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1875). The Supreme Court ruled that the Enforcement Act of 1870 (which was based on the Bill of Rights and 14th Amendment) applied only to actions committed by the state and that it did not apply to actions committed by individuals or private conspiracies (''See,'' [[Morrison Remick Waite]]). This meant that the Federal government could not prosecute cases such as the Colfax killings. The court said plaintiffs who believed their rights were abridged had to seek protection from the state. Louisiana did not prosecute any of the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre; most southern states would not prosecute white men for attacks against freedmen.

The publicity about the Colfax Massacre and subsequent Supreme Court ruling encouraged the growth of white [[paramilitary organizations]]. In May 1874, Nash formed the first chapter of the [[White League]] from his paramilitary group, and chapters soon were formed in other areas of Louisiana, as well as the southern parts of nearby states. Unlike the former KKK, they operated openly and often curried publicity. One historian described them as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref> Other paramilitary groups such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] also arose, especially in [[South Carolina]] and [[Mississippi]], which also had black majorities of population, and in certain counties in North Carolina.

Paramilitary groups used violence and murder to terrorize leaders among the freedmen and white Republicans, as well as to repress voting among freedmen during the 1870s. Black American citizens had little recourse. In August 1874, for instance, the White League threw out Republican officeholders in [[Coushatta, Louisiana|Coushatta]], [[Red River Parish]], assassinating the six whites before they left the state, and killing five to 15 freedmen who were witnesses. Four of the white men killed were related to the state representative from the area.<ref>Eric Foner (2002),''Reconstruction'', p. 551</ref> Such violence served to intimidate voters and officeholders; it was one of the methods that white Democrats used to gain control of the state legislature in the 1876 elections and ultimately to dismantle Reconstruction in Louisiana.

==Memorials==
The scale of the massacre and the political conflict it represents are of state and national significance in relation to Reconstruction and United States racial histories.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Despite this, the event has been hidden in local history for decades.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Moreover, the site has changed: some of the areas have been paved, and the old courthouse was torn down and a new courthouse was built.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Finally, without [[archeological]] work to establish where victims were buried at the site, people have had difficulty defining a site to gain approval for a historic memorial.{{cn|date=June 2019}} 

In 1920, a committee met in Colfax to purchase a monument to memorialize the three white men who died. This monument stands in Colfax Cemetery and reads \"Erected to the memory of the Heroes, /

In 1950, Louisiana erected a state highway marker noting the event of 1873 as \"the Colfax Riot,\" as the event was traditionally called in the white community. The marker states, \"On this site occurred the Colfax Riot, in which three white men and 150 negroes were slain. This event on April 13, 1873, marked the end of [[Carpetbagger|carpetbag]] misrule in [[Southern United States|the South]].\"<ref>Keith (2007), Colfax Massacre, p. 169</ref><ref name=\"Rubin\"/><ref>https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2020/4/12/1931446/-The-Easter-massacre-of-1873-and-the-subsequent-Supreme-Court-decision-that-sabotaged-Reconstruction?detail=emaildkre </ref>

==Renewed attention==
The Colfax massacre is among the events of Reconstruction and late 19th-century history which have received new national attention in the early 21st century, much as the [[Rosewood massacre|1923 massacre]] in [[Rosewood, Florida]] did near the end of the 20th century. In 2007 and 2008 two new books were published on the topic: Leeanna Keith's ''The Colfax Massacre: The Untold Story of Black Power, White Terror, and the Death of Reconstruction'',{{full|date=June 2019}} and Charles Lane's ''The Day Freedom Died: The Colfax Massacre, the Supreme Court, and the Betrayal of Reconstruction.''{{full|date=June 2019}} Lane especially addressed the political and legal implications of the Supreme Court case, which arose out of the prosecution of several men of the white paramilitary groups.{{cn|date=June 2019}} In addition, a film documentary is in preparation.{{cn|date=June 2019}}

In 2007 the Red River Heritage Association, Inc. was formed as a group intending to establish a museum in Colfax for collecting materials and interpreting the history of Reconstruction in Louisiana and especially the Red River area.{{cn|date=June 2019}}

In 2008, on the 135th anniversary of the Colfax massacre, an interracial group commemorated the event. They laid flowers where some victims had fallen and held a forum to discuss the history.<ref>[http://blog.oup.com/2008/04/history-is-a-gift-the-colfax-massacre/ LeeAnna Keith, \"History is a Gift: The Colfax Massacre\"], Blog: Oxford University Press, 17 Apr 2008; accessed 13 Aug 2008</ref>

[[File:Colfax Riot sign IMG 2401.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Colfax Riot [[historical marker]] (1950) in Colfax refers to \"[[carpetbagger|carpetbag]] misrule in the [[American South|South]].\"]]

The '''Colfax massacre''', or '''Colfax riot''' as the events are termed on the 1950 state historic marker, occurred on [[Easter Sunday]], April 13, 1873, in [[Colfax, Louisiana]], the seat of [[Grant Parish, Louisiana|Grant Parish]], where approximately 150 black men were murdered by white Southerners who had formed a militia. Three white men died in the confrontation, with at least one said to have been shot by his own side. 

In the wake of the contested 1872 election for [[governor of Louisiana]] and local offices, a group of white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] armed with rifles and a small cannon, overpowered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[freedmen]] and state [[militia]] (also black) occupying the Grant Parish [[courthouse]] in Colfax.<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\">[[Eric Foner]], ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877'', p. 437</ref><ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/grant/peopleevents/e_colfax.html ''Ulysses S. Grant'', People and Events: \"The Colfax Massacre\", PBS Website], accessed Apr 6, 2008</ref> Most of the [[freedmen]] were killed after they surrendered; nearly 50 were killed later that night after being held as prisoners for several hours. Estimates of the number of dead have varied, ranging from 62 to 153; three whites died but the number of black victims was difficult to determine because many bodies were thrown into the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] or removed for burial. There were rumors of mass graves at the site.

Historian [[Eric Foner]] described the massacre as the worst instance of racial violence during Reconstruction.<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/> In Louisiana, it had the most fatalities of any of the numerous violent events following the disputed gubernatorial contest in 1872 between [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Foner wrote, \"...every election [in Louisiana] between 1868 and 1876 was marked by rampant violence and pervasive fraud.\"<ref name=\"Eric Foner 1989, p. 550\">Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877'', New York: Perennial Library, 1989, p. 550</ref> Although the [[Electoral fusion|Fusionist]]-dominated state \"returning board,\" which ruled on vote validity, initially declared [[John McEnery (Louisiana)|John McEnery]] and his Democratic slate the winners, the board eventually split, with a faction declaring Republican [[William P. Kellogg]] the victor. A Republican federal judge in New Orleans ruled that the Republican-majority legislature be seated.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=b13}}</ref>

Federal prosecution and conviction of a few perpetrators at Colfax under the [[Enforcement Acts]] was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In a key case, the court ruled in ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876) that protections of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] did not apply to the actions of individuals, but only to the actions of state governments. After this ruling, the federal government could no longer use the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]] to prosecute actions by [[paramilitary organizations|paramilitary groups]] such as the [[White League]], which had chapters forming across Louisiana beginning in 1874. Intimidation, murders, and black voter suppression by such paramilitary groups were instrumental to the Democratic Party regaining political control in the state legislature by the late 1870s.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, historians have paid renewed attention to the events at Colfax and the resulting Supreme Court case, and their meaning in American history.

==State and national background==

In March 1865, Unionist planter [[James Madison Wells]] became governor. As the Democratic-dominated legislature passed Black Codes that restricted rights of freedmen, Wells began to lean toward allowing blacks to vote and temporarily [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] ex-Confederates. To accomplish this, he scheduled a new constitutional convention for July 30, 1866.<ref>{{Cite book|title=By One Vote|last=Holt|first=Michael|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2008|isbn=|location=Lawrence, Kansas|pages=195–96}}</ref>

It was postponed because of the [[New Orleans Massacre]] that day, in which armed Southern white Democrats attacked blacks who had a parade in support of the convention. Anticipating trouble, the mayor of New Orleans had asked the local military commander to police the city and protect the convention. The U. S. Army failed to promptly respond to the mayor's request and a group of numerous unarmed blacks was attacked by whites, resulting in 38 deaths: 34 black and four white; and more than 40 wounded, most of them black.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reconstruction|last=Craven|first=Avery|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=1969|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=186–87}}</ref> 

When President [[Andrew Johnson]] blamed the [[massacre]] on Republican agitation, a popular national backlash against Johnson's policies led to national voters electing a majority Republican Congress in 1866. It passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] over Andrew Johnson's veto. Earlier the Freedmen's Bureau and the occupation armies had prevented Southern [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]], which had limited the rights of freedmen and other blacks, (including their choices of work and living locations) from going into effect.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of the South|last=Simkins|first=Francis|last2=Roland|first2=Charles|publisher=Alfred A.

On March 2, 1867, they passed the [[Reconstruction Act]], over Johnson's veto, which required that blacks be given the franchise—in Southern states but not in Northern states—and that reconstructed Southern states ratify the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] before admission to the Union.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Civil War and Reconstruction|last=Randall|first=J.

By April 1868, a biracial coalition in Louisiana had elected a Republican-majority state legislature but violence increased before the fall election. Almost all of the victims were black and some white Republicans who were protecting the black Republican freedmen. Insurgents also attacked men physically or burned their homes to discourage them from voting. President Johnson, a Democrat, prevented the Republican governor of Louisiana from using either the state militia or U.S. forces to suppress the insurgent groups, such as the [[Knights of the White Camelia]].<ref name=\"Lane\">{{harvnb|Lane|2008}}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

According to Lane, after [[Ulysses S. Grant]] became President in 1869, he \"lobbied hard for the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]\" (ratified February 3, 1870),<ref> Lane 2008, p. 1f </ref> which guaranteed that blacks, most of whom were newly freed slaves, would have full citizenship and suffrage.{{cn|date=June 2019}} The [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), and other insurgent groups{{cn|date=June 2019}}, continued violent attacks and killed scores of blacks in [[Arkansas]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Mississippi]] and elsewhere,<ref> Lane 2008, p. 3f </ref> to discourage their voting in the 1870 elections.{{cn|date=June 2019}} On May 31, 1870, Congress passed an [[Enforcement Act]] based on the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] and Fifteenth amendments.<ref name=Lane_p4> Lane 2008, p. 4 </ref> They followed this with the [[Ku Klux Klan Act]], enacted April 20, 1871, which  Grant used to suspend the writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and use the \"army to round up Klansmen and present them for trial in federal court\".<ref name=Lane_p4/>

==Louisiana and Grant Parish==
Governor [[Henry Clay Warmoth]] struggled to maintain political balance in Louisiana. Among his appointments, he installed William Ward, a black [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] veteran, as commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, a new unit to be based in Grant Parish to help control the violence there and in other Red River parishes. Ward, born a slave in 1840 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], had learned to read and write as a valet to a master in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. In 1864 he escaped and went to [[Fortress Monroe]], where he joined the [[Union Army]] and served until after General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender. About 1870 he came to Grant Parish, where he had a friend. He quickly became active among local blacks in the Republican Party. After his appointment to the militia, Ward recruited other freedmen for his forces, several of whom were veterans of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|pp=54–56}}</ref>

==Louisiana election of 1872==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}
In Louisiana, Republican governor [[Henry Clay Warmoth]] defected from the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republicans]] (a group that opposed President Grant's [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]) policies in 1872. Warmoth previously supported a constitutional amendment that allowed former Confederates, who had been denied the right to vote, to be re-enfranchised. A \"Fusionist\" coalition of Liberal Republicans and Democrats nominated ex-Confederate battalion commander and Democrat [[John McEnery (politician)|John McEnery]] to succeed him as governor. In return, Democrats and Liberal Republicans were to send Warmoth to Washington as a [[U.S. Senator]]. Opposing McEnery was Republican [[William Pitt Kellogg]], one of Louisiana's U.S. Senators. Voting on November 4, 1872, resulted in dual governments, as a Fusionist (Liberal Republicans and Democrat)-dominated returning board declared McEnery the winner while a faction of the board proclaimed Kellogg the winner. Both administrations held inaugural ceremonies and certified their lists of local candidates.

After failing to win their case in state court, the Kellogg forces appealed to federal judge Edward Durell in [[New Orleans]] to intervene and order that Kellogg and the Stalwart Republican-majority legislature were to be seated, and for Grant to authorize U.S. army troops to protect Kellogg's government. This action was widely criticized across the nation by Democrats and both wings of the Republican Party because it was considered to be a violation of the rights of states to manage their own (non-federal-office) elections. Thus, investigating committees of both chambers of the federal Congress in Washington were critical of the Kellogg choice. The House majority ruled Durell's action illegal and the Senate majority concluded that the Kellogg regime was \"not much better than a successful conspiracy.\" In 1874 a House investigating committee in Washington recommended that Judge Durell be impeached for corruption and illegally interfering in the Louisiana 1872 state elections, but the judge resigned in order to avoid impeachment.<ref>William Hesseltine, \"Grant the Politician\", 344</ref><ref>Charles Lane, *The Green Bag*, \"Edward Henry Durell,\" 167-68</ref>

McEnery's faction tried to take control of the state arsenal at [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]], but Kellogg had the state militia seize dozens of leaders of McEnery's faction and control New Orleans, where the state government was located.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}} McEnery returned to try to take control with a private paramilitary group. In September 1873 his forces, over 8,000 strong, entered the city and defeated the city/state militia of about 3500 in New Orleans. The Democrats took control of the state house, armory and police stations, where the state government was then located, in what was known as the Battle of Jackson Square. His forces held those buildings for three days before retreating before Federal troops arrived.<ref name=\"Eric Foner 1989, p. 550\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=General James Longstreet|last=Wert|first=Jeffry|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=416}}</ref> Warmoth was subsequently impeached by the state legislature in a bribery scandal stemming from his actions in the 1872 election.

Warmoth appointed Democrats as parish registrars, and they ensured the voter rolls included as many whites and as few freedmen as possible. A number of registrars changed the registration site without notifying blacks. They also required blacks to prove they were over 21, while knowing that former slaves did not have birth certificates. In Grant Parish, one plantation owner threatened to expel blacks from homes they rented on his land if they voted Republican. Fusionists also tampered with ballot boxes on election day. One was found with a hole in it, apparently used for stuffing the ballot box. As a result, Grant Parish Fusionists claimed a landslide victory, even though black voters outnumbered whites by 776 to 630.

Warmoth issued commissions to Fusionist Democrats Alphonse Cazabat and [[Christopher Columbus Nash]], elected parish judge and sheriff, respectively. Like many white men in the South, Nash was a Confederate veteran (as an officer, he had been held for a year and a half as a [[prisoner of war]] at [[Johnson's Island]] in [[Ohio]]). Cazabat and Nash took their oaths of office in the Colfax courthouse on January 2, 1873. They dispatched the documents to Governor McEnery in New Orleans.

William Pitt Kellogg issued commissions to the Republican slate for Grant Parish on January 17 and 18. By then Nash and Cazabat controlled the small, primitive courthouse. Republican Robert C. Register insisted that he, not Alphonse Cazabat, was the parish judge and that Republican Daniel Wesley Shaw, not Nash, was to be the sheriff. On the night of March 25, the Republicans seized the empty courthouse and took their oaths of office. They sent their oaths to the Kellogg administration in New Orleans.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

Grant Parish was one of a number of new parishes created by the Republican government in an effort to build local support in the state. Both the land and its people were originally tied to the Calhoun family, whose plantation had covered more than the borders of the new parish. The freedmen had been slaves on the plantation. The parish also took in the less-developed hill country. The total population had a narrow majority of 2400 freedmen, who mostly voted Republican, and 2200 whites, who voted as Democrats. Statewide political tensions were reflected in the rumors going around each community, often about white fears of black attacks or outrage, which added to local tensions.<ref name=\"libertychapelcemetery.org\">[http://www.libertychapelcemetery.org/files/hogue-colfax.pdf James K. Hogue, \"The Battle of Colfax: Paramilitarism and Counterrevolution in Louisiana\"], 2006, accessed Aug 15, 2008</ref>

==Colfax courthouse conflict==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}
Fearful that the Democrats might try to take over the local parish government, blacks started to create trenches around the courthouse and drilled to keep alert. The Republican officeholders stayed there overnight. They held the town for three weeks.<ref>{{cite book

On March 28, Nash, Cazabat, Hadnot and other white Fusionists called for armed whites to retake the courthouse on April 1. Whites were recruited from nearby Winn and surrounding parishes to join their effort. The Republicans Shaw, Register, and Flowers and others began to collect a posse of armed blacks to defend the courthouse.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

Black Republicans Lewis Meekins and state militia captain William Ward, a black [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] veteran, raided the homes of the opposition leaders: Judge William R. Rutland, Bill Cruikshank, and Jim Hadnot. Gunfire erupted between whites and blacks on April 2 and again on April 5, but the shotguns were too inaccurate to do any harm. The two sides arranged for peace negotiations. Peace ended when a white man shot and killed a black man named Jesse McKinney, described as a bystander. Another armed conflict on April 6 ended with whites fleeing from armed blacks.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 154</ref> With all the unrest in the community, black women and children joined the men at the courthouse for protection.

William Ward, the commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, headquartered in Grant Parish, had been elected state representative from the parish on the Republican ticket.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=56}}</ref> He wrote to Governor Kellogg seeking U.S. troops for reinforcement and gave the letter to William Smith Calhoun for delivery. Calhoun took the steamboat ''LaBelle'' down the Red River but was captured by Paul Hooe, Hadnot, and Cruikshank. They ordered Calhoun to tell blacks to leave the courthouse.

The black defenders refused to leave although threatened by parties of armed whites commanded by Nash. To recruit men during the rising political tensions, Nash had contributed to lurid rumors that blacks were preparing to kill all the white men and take the white women as their own.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/colfaxmassacreun00keit/page/117 Keith (2007), ''The Colfax Massacre''], p. 117</ref> On April 8 the anti-Republican ''[[Daily Picayune]]'' newspaper of New Orleans inflamed tensions and distorted events by the following headline: 

{{quote|THE RIOT IN GRANT PARISH. FEARFUL ATROCITIES BY THE NEGROES. NO RESPECT SHOWN TO THE DEAD.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=84}}</ref>}}

Such news attracted more whites from the region to Grant Parish to join Nash; all were experienced Confederate veterans. They acquired a four-pound cannon that could fire iron slugs. As the Klansman Dave Paul said, \"Boys, this is a struggle for [[white supremacy]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=91}}</ref>

Suffering from [[tuberculosis]] and [[rheumatism]], on April 11 the militia captain Ward took a steamboat downriver to New Orleans to seek armed help directly from Kellogg. He was not there for the following events.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=57}}</ref>

==Massacre==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}
Cazabat had directed Nash as sheriff to put down what he called a riot. Nash gathered an armed white [[paramilitary]] group and veteran officers from [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides]], [[Winn Parish, Louisiana|Winn]] and [[Catahoula Parish, Louisiana|Catahoula]] parishes. He did not move his forces toward the courthouse until noon on Easter Sunday, April 13. Nash led more than 300 armed white men, most on horseback and armed with rifles. Nash reportedly ordered the defenders of the courthouse to leave. When that failed, Nash gave women and children camped outside the courthouse thirty minutes to clear out. After they left, the shooting began. The fighting continued for several hours with few casualties. When Nash's paramilitary maneuvered the cannon behind the building, some of the defenders panicked and left the courthouse.

About 60 defenders ran into nearby woods and jumped into the river. Nash sent men on horseback after the fleeing black Republicans, and his paramilitary group killed most of them on the spot. Soon Nash's forces directed a black captive to set the courthouse roof on fire. The defenders displayed [[white flag]]s for surrender: one made from a shirt, the other from a page of a book. The shooting stopped.

Nash's group approached and called for those surrendering to throw down their weapons and come outside. What happened next is in dispute. According to the reports of some whites, James Hadnot was shot and wounded by someone from the courthouse. \"In the Negro version, the men in the courthouse were stacking their guns when the white men approached, and Hadnot was shot from behind by an overexcited member of his own force.\"<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paperback, 2007, p.18</ref> Hadnot died later, after being taken downstream by a passing steamboat.<ref>Lemann (2007), ''Redemption,'' p. 18</ref>

In the aftermath of Hadnot's shooting, the white paramilitary group reacted with mass murders of the black men. As more than 40 times as many blacks died as did whites, historians describe the event as a massacre. The white paramilitary group killed unarmed men trying to hide in the courthouse. They rode down and killed those attempting to flee. They dumped some bodies in the Red River. About 50 blacks survived the afternoon and were taken prisoner. Later that night they were summarily killed by their captors, who had been drinking. Only one black from the group, Levi Nelson, survived. He was shot by Cruikshank but managed to crawl away unnoticed. He later served as one of the Federal government's chief witnesses against those who were [[Indictment|indicted]] for the attacks.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=124}}</ref>

Kellogg sent state militia colonels Theodore DeKlyne and William Wright to Colfax with warrants to arrest 50 white men and to install a new, compromise slate of parish officers. DeKlyne and Wright found the smoking ruins of the courthouse at Colfax, and many bodies of men who had been shot in the back of the head or the neck. They described that one body was charred, another man's head was beaten beyond recognition, and another had a slashed throat. Surviving blacks told DeKlyne and Wright that blacks dug a trench around the courthouse to protect it from what they saw as an attempt by white Democrats to steal an election. They were attacked by whites armed with rifles, revolvers and a small cannon. When blacks refused to leave, the courthouse was burned, and the black defenders were shot down. While the whites accused blacks of violating a flag of truce and rioting, black Republicans said that none of this was true. They accused whites of marching captured prisoners away in pairs and shooting them in the back of the head.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

On April 14 some of Governor Kellogg's new police force arrived from New Orleans. Several days later, two companies of Federal troops arrived. They searched for white paramilitary members, but many had already fled to [[Texas]] or the hills. The officers filed a military report in which they identified by name three whites and 105 blacks who had died, plus noted they had recovered 15-20 unidentified blacks from the river. They also noted the savage nature of many of the killings, suggesting an out-of-control situation.<ref name=\"ftp.rootsweb.com\">[http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/la/state/history/military/uncat/colfaxr.txt \"Military Report on Colfax Riot, 1875\"], ''Congressional Record''], accessed Apr 6, 2008</ref>

The historian Eric Foner, a specialist in the Civil War and Reconstruction, wrote about the event:

{{quote|The bloodiest single instance of racial carnage in the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]], the Colfax massacre taught many lessons, including the lengths to which some opponents of Reconstruction would go to regain their accustomed authority. Among blacks in Louisiana, the incident was long remembered as proof that in any large confrontation, they stood at a fatal disadvantage.<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/>}}

<blockquote>\"The organization against them is too strong. ...\" Louisiana black teacher and Reconstruction legislator [[John G. Lewis]] later remarked. \"They attempted [armed self-defense] in Colfax. The result was that on [[Easter Sunday]] of 1873 when the sun went down that night, it went down on the corpses of two hundred and eighty negroes.\"<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/></blockquote>

==Aftermath==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}
[[James Roswell Beckwith]], the US Attorney based in New Orleans, sent an urgent telegram about the massacre to the [[Attorney General of the United States|U.S. Attorney General]]. The massacre in Colfax gained headlines of national newspapers from [[Boston]] to [[Chicago]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=22}}</ref> Various government forces spent weeks trying to round up members of the white paramilitaries, and a total of 97 men were indicted. In the end, Beckwith charged nine men and brought them to trial for violations of the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]]. It had been designed to provide federal protection for [[civil rights]] of freedmen under the [[14th Amendment of the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] against actions by [[terrorist]] groups such as the Klan.

The men were charged with one murder, and charges related to a conspiracy against the rights of freedmen. There were two succeeding trials in 1874. [[William Burnham Woods]] presided over the first trial and was sympathetic to the prosecution. Had the men been convicted, they would not have been able to appeal their decision to any appellate court according to the laws of the time. However, Beckworth was unable to secure a conviction—one man was acquitted, and a mistrial was declared in the cases of the other eight. 

In the second trial, three men were found guilty of sixteen charges. However, the presiding judge, [[Joseph Bradley]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]] ([[circuit justice|riding circuit]]), dismissed the convictions, ruling that the charges violated the [[state actor]] doctrine, failed to prove a racial rationale for the massacre, or were [[void for vagueness]]. ''[[Sua sponte]]'', he ordered that the men be released on bail, and they promptly disappeared.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York; Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2006, p.25</ref>

When the federal government appealed the case, it was heard by the US Supreme Court as ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1875). The Supreme Court ruled that the Enforcement Act of 1870 (which was based on the Bill of Rights and 14th Amendment) applied only to actions committed by the state and that it did not apply to actions committed by individuals or private conspiracies (''See,'' [[Morrison Remick Waite]]). This meant that the Federal government could not prosecute cases such as the Colfax killings. The court said plaintiffs who believed their rights were abridged had to seek protection from the state. Louisiana did not prosecute any of the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre; most southern states would not prosecute white men for attacks against freedmen.

The publicity about the Colfax Massacre and subsequent Supreme Court ruling encouraged the growth of white [[paramilitary organizations]]. In May 1874, Nash formed the first chapter of the [[White League]] from his paramilitary group, and chapters soon were formed in other areas of Louisiana, as well as the southern parts of nearby states. Unlike the former KKK, they operated openly and often curried publicity. One historian described them as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref> Other paramilitary groups such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] also arose, especially in [[South Carolina]] and [[Mississippi]], which also had black majorities of population, and in certain counties in North Carolina.

Paramilitary groups used violence and murder to terrorize leaders among the freedmen and white Republicans, as well as to repress voting among freedmen during the 1870s. Black American citizens had little recourse. In August 1874, for instance, the White League threw out Republican officeholders in [[Coushatta, Louisiana|Coushatta]], [[Red River Parish]], assassinating the six whites before they left the state, and killing five to 15 freedmen who were witnesses. Four of the white men killed were related to the state representative from the area.<ref>Eric Foner (2002),''Reconstruction'', p. 551</ref> Such violence served to intimidate voters and officeholders; it was one of the methods that white Democrats used to gain control of the state legislature in the 1876 elections and ultimately to dismantle Reconstruction in Louisiana.

==Memorials==
The scale of the massacre and the political conflict it represents are of state and national significance in relation to Reconstruction and United States racial histories.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Despite this, the event has been hidden in local history for decades.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Moreover, the site has changed: some of the areas have been paved, and the old courthouse was torn down and a new courthouse was built.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Finally, without [[archeological]] work to establish where victims were buried at the site, people have had difficulty defining a site to gain approval for a historic memorial.{{cn|date=June 2019}} 

In 1920, a committee met in Colfax to purchase a monument to memorialize the three white men who died. This monument stands in Colfax Cemetery and reads \"Erected to the memory of the Heroes, /
Stephen Decatur Parish /
James West Hadnot /
Sidney Harris /
Who fell in the Colfax Riot fighting 
for White Supremacy.\"<ref name=\"Rubin\">{{cite journal| last = Rubin| first = Richard| title = The Colfax Riot| journal = The Atlantic Monthly| publisher = The Atlantic Monthly| date = July–August 2003| url = https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2003/07/rubin.htm| accessdate = June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Find a Grave|86852507|Colfax Riot Memorial}}</ref>

In 1950, Louisiana erected a state highway marker noting the event of 1873 as \"the Colfax Riot,\" as the event was traditionally called in the white community. The marker states, \"On this site occurred the Colfax Riot, in which three white men and 150 negroes were slain. This event on April 13, 1873, marked the end of [[Carpetbagger|carpetbag]] misrule in [[Southern United States|the South]].\"<ref>Keith (2007), Colfax Massacre, p. 169</ref><ref name=\"Rubin\"/>

==Renewed attention==
The Colfax massacre is among the events of Reconstruction and late 19th-century history which have received new national attention in the early 21st century, much as the [[Rosewood massacre|1923 massacre]] in [[Rosewood, Florida]] did near the end of the 20th century. In 2007 and 2008 two new books were published on the topic: Leeanna Keith's ''The Colfax Massacre: The Untold Story of Black Power, White Terror, and the Death of Reconstruction'',{{full|date=June 2019}} and Charles Lane's ''The Day Freedom Died: The Colfax Massacre, the Supreme Court, and the Betrayal of Reconstruction.''{{full|date=June 2019}} Lane especially addressed the political and legal implications of the Supreme Court case, which arose out of the prosecution of several men of the white paramilitary groups.{{cn|date=June 2019}} In addition, a film documentary is in preparation.{{cn|date=June 2019}}

In 2007 the Red River Heritage Association, Inc. was formed as a group intending to establish a museum in Colfax for collecting materials and interpreting the history of Reconstruction in Louisiana and especially the Red River area.{{cn|date=June 2019}}

In 2008, on the 135th anniversary of the Colfax massacre, an interracial group commemorated the event. They laid flowers where some victims had fallen and held a forum to discuss the history.<ref>[http://blog.oup.com/2008/04/history-is-a-gift-the-colfax-massacre/ LeeAnna Keith, \"History is a Gift: The Colfax Massacre\"], Blog: Oxford University Press, 17 Apr 2008; accessed 13 Aug 2008</ref>

'''''The Talk''''' is an<!--Do not add things like \"Emmy-Award winning\" or \"People's Choice Award winning,\" that is undue weight.--> [[United States|American]] [[talk show]] that debuted on October 18, 2010, as part of [[CBS]]'s [[CBS Daytime|daytime]] programming block.<ref name=\"cbs_order\">{{cite web|title=CBS Orders New Daytime Talk Show for Fall |url= http://www.cbspressexpress.com/div.php/cbs_entertainment/release?id=25604|website=CBS PressExpress|publisher=[[CBS]]|date=July 22, 2010|accessdate=November 17, 2010}}</ref> The show was developed by actress and host [[Sara Gilbert]].

The show features [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Sheryl Underwood]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] (who also serves as the show's moderator) and [[Marie Osmond]]. They discuss the day's latest headlines, while usually tying in the show's theme of motherhood or at least parenthood, such as by giving their opinions \"through the eyes of mothers.\" The show also contains celebrity interviews and segments for mothers and parents in general.

''The Talk'' is broadcast before a live studio audience at the [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, California]] each Monday through Friday at 11:00 a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]], and airs live on most CBS [[owned-and-operated station]]s and [[network affiliate|affiliates]] in the [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] and [[Central United States]] at 2:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. The program is broadcast on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] elsewhere from the [[Mountain Time Zone]] westward. The Friday shows are recorded on Thursday afternoons at 1:00&nbsp;pm PT for broadcast the next day. Friday shows are taped before the same studio audience in attendance for the earlier live Thursday broadcast.

==Format==
''The Talk'' has a format similar in style to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''.  The opening segment of the broadcast is known as \"Everybody Talks\" and usually runs a combined 12 to 25 minutes over multiple segments, depending on the number of stories featured and the number of guests.  It is followed by topical discussion segments, involves the five-female host panel discussing current news items, typically focusing on [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headlines, offbeat stories, and celebrity news. The program also actively incorporates [[social media]] to allow viewers to provide their opinions on the stories discussed through [[Twitter]] (using the hashtag #EverybodyTalks, or alternately the abbreviated #EVBT).  In season five, the program began allowing viewers to use [[Instagram]] to record and upload videos using the aforementioned hashtags, with one or two videos being selected to air on the live broadcasts.<ref>{{cite press release|title=CBS's \"The Talk\" Kicks Off Season 5 Monday, Sept. 8!|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2014/09/02/cbss-the-talk-kicks-off-season-5-monday-sept-8-45010/20140902cbs01/|publisher=CBS|via=The Futon Critic|date=September 2, 2014|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}</ref>

On most editions, the \"Top Talker\" serves as the final segment of the topical discussion, featuring a rotating set of contributors - most of whom are correspondents/hosts of entertainment-related newsmagazine programs or magazines or hosts of local or syndicated radio programs - providing detailed analysis of a single trending, usually celebrity-related, story. Following the \"Everybody Talks\" segment, all five hosts interview one or two featured celebrity guests; most of these interviews are conducted at the set's roundtable. Musical performances are also occasionally included.

The show also regularly has a cooking segment two to four times each week, with two of the panelists - rotating between any combination of Chen, Underwood, Gilbert, or Osbourne - assisting in the preparation of the featured recipes with the guest chef. Product giveaways are also done once per week, as part of a segment showcasing fashion/beauty products and electronics that are given away to studio audience members for attending the show, and are often tied into online [[Deal of the day|flash sale]]s where the viewing audience can purchase the products offered at a reduced price.

To conclude the show through season 9, each episode signed-off with one of the co-hosts, primarily the moderator, saying \"Remember, it's always the right time to have ''The Talk!''\". With the start of season 10 the sign-off \"Let's Talk Tomorrow!\" or \"Let's Talk Later\" (used on Friday) is used.

==Development==
In December 2009, CBS announced the cancellation of ''[[As the World Turns]]'' after 54 years, and was looking for a program to replace the long-running [[soap opera]] in its time slot. Sara Gilbert approached CBS about producing a pilot that would feature six women talking about the day's headlines with opinions told through \"the eyes of mothers.\"<ref name = Mothers />

On July 21, 2010, CBS announced that it had picked up the show (by then, given the title ''The Talk''), beating out several other contenders, including a cooking show featuring [[Emeril Lagasse]]; ''Say It Now'', a talk show featuring [[Valerie Bertinelli]] and [[Rove McManus]]; and a revamped version of the classic game show ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'', hosted by [[Andy Richter]].<ref name=Mothers>{{cite web|title=Sara Gilbert talk show to replace veteran CBS soap|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/21/us-gilbert-idUSTRE66K5XA20100721|author=Georg Szalai|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=September 19, 2012|date=July 21, 2010}}</ref>

In the 4 weeks prior to the show's debut, new episodes of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', as well as repeats of ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', aired in the timeslot vacated by ''As the World Turns''.

===Season 1===
The original panel consisted of [[Sara Gilbert]], known for her role on the TV series ''[[Roseanne]]''; [[Holly Robinson Peete]], known for her roles on the TV series ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' and ''[[Hangin' with Mr. Cooper]]''; [[Leah Remini]], known for her role as Carrie Heffernan in the 1998–2007 CBS sitcom ''[[The King of Queens]]''; ''[[Big Brother (U.S.)|Big Brother]]'' hostess [[Julie Chen]]; and former talk show hostess/''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|X Factor]]'' judge [[Sharon Osbourne]], the wife of rocker [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. [[Marissa Jaret Winokur]] was featured in an out-of-the studio position as the \"mother on the street,\" dealing with issues like taking her toddler on an airplane, talking with kids about sex, talking to parents about the \"[[Child development stage|terrible twos]]\" and other parental issues.

On January 14, 2011, Marissa Jaret Winokur reported that she would not be returning to the show in 2011. In an exclusive statement to ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', original executive producer Brad Bessey said of Winokur's departure, \"We think the world of Marissa as a creative talent, on-air personality and super mom. This is a mutual decision based on time, not talent.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Hairspray's Marissa Jaret Winokur Exits CBS' \"The Talk\"|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/146759-Hairsprays-Marissa-Jaret-Winokur-Exits-CBS-The-Talk|author=Adam Hetrick|periodical=[[Playbill]]|publisher=Philip S Birsh (Rights and Permissions)|date=January 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Marissa Jaret Winokur Leaves 'The Talk'|url=http://www.popeater.com/2011/01/15/marissa-jaret-winokur-leaves-the-talk/|author=Christine Fenno|website=PopEater|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] ([[AOL]])|date=January 15, 2011|accessdate= April 11, 2014}}</ref>

When ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' resumed filming on March 2, 2011, Osbourne's daughter [[Kelly Osbourne]] began filling in for her on a substitute basis, as the show's first substitute host.

On August 26, 2011, it was announced that original co-host Leah Remini had been released from the show.<ref>{{cite web|title=It's Official: Leah Remini Is Leaving The Talk|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/moviestvmusic/news/its-official-leah-remini-is-leaving-the-talk-2011268|periodical=[[Us Magazine]]|publisher=[[Wenner Media]]|date=August 26, 2011|accessdate=December 26, 2011}}</ref> On September 2, 2011, it was confirmed that Holly Robinson Peete had also been released from the show.<ref>{{cite web|title=Enough Talk: Holly Robinson Peete \"Officially\" Not Returning to Chatfest|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/261761/enough-talk-holly-robinson-peete-officially-not-returning-to-chatfest|author=Brandi Fowler|website=[[E!|E!

===''The Talk: Chat Room''===
Carrie Ann Inaba originally announced on the March 12, 2020 episode that due to the coronavirus pandemic The Talk would broadcast without an audience. After CBS forced the production to shut down Inaba began hosting a daily [[Instagram]] live from her own home during the stay at home order. CBS greenlit Inaba's daily Instagram live show while including all five co-hosts under a new format using social media tools.

===''The Talk: @Home''===
Due to the global Covid-19 pandemic CBS halted the in-studio production of The Talk. On March 30, 2020 the show began using the [[Zoom Video Communications|Zoom]] platform allowing the shows host (and guests) to broadcast from their homes. The format of the show remains the same starting with discussions from trending current events, host discussions, and having guest join who are also using the same video platform. The @Home format arose from the hosts doing a daily [[Instagram]] broadcast each day at the same time the show was scheduled to air. The Talk will continue to use the @Home format for the foreseeable future.

==Appearances in other media==
On March 14, 2016, all of ''The Talk'' hosts (including then host [[Aisha Tyler]]) made a cameo on ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' in the episode \"Falling\" when [[Cat Grant]] (played by [[Calista Flockhart]]) made a guest appearance on ''The Talk''. On December 15, 2017, [[Julie Chen]] revealed that all of the current hosts of The Talk (including new co-host [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]]) will be featured on an episode of [[Jane the Virgin]] as themselves which was directed by [[Gina Rodriguez]]. On January 10, 2018, ''The Talk'' revealed on their Instagram and Snapchat stories they filmed their episode of ''Jane the Virgin'' on the set of ''The Talk'' right after filming the show for the aforementioned date. On February 9, 2018, Rodriguez made a guest appearance on the show to announce the episode featuring the ladies of ''The Talk'', called \"Chapter Seventy-Four\" would air that night.

===Criticism===
''The Talk'' was criticized for a segment where some panelists made light of male genital mutilation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hughes|first=Sarah|title=‘The Talk’ ladies under fire for laughing at Catherine Kieu story (Video)|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/the-talk-ladies-under-fire-for-laughing-at-catherine-kieu-story-video/2011/07/18/gIQA3OjkLI_blog.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Adams Publishing Group]]|accessdate=July 18, 2011}}</ref> Osbourne said, \"However, I do think it is quite fabulous\" in response to a story where a wife had drugged her husband, cut off his penis, and put it in the garbage disposal due to his filing for divorce. An apology was made during a subsequent show.

The failure to disclose on-air as to why Remini and Robinson Peete were released or even mention them brought about criticism of the show from some viewers, with some fans of the two stars protesting their dismissals.<ref>{{cite news|title='The Talk' Debuts Without Leah Remini and Holly Robinson Peete: What the Viewers Are Saying|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/talk-debuts-leah-remini-holly-231686|author=Jethro Nede|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=September 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='The Talk' Without Leah Remini and Holly Robinson Peete: What THR Readers Are Saying |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/talk-leah-remini-holly-robinson-232147|author=Jethro Nede|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=September 6, 2011}}</ref>

'''''The Talk''''' is an<!--Do not add things like \"Emmy-Award winning\" or \"People's Choice Award winning,\" that is undue weight.--> [[United States|American]] [[talk show]] that debuted on October 18, 2010, as part of [[CBS]]'s [[CBS Daytime|daytime]] programming block.<ref name=\"cbs_order\">{{cite web|title=CBS Orders New Daytime Talk Show for Fall |url= http://www.cbspressexpress.com/div.php/cbs_entertainment/release?id=25604|website=CBS PressExpress|publisher=[[CBS]]|date=July 22, 2010|accessdate=November 17, 2010}}</ref> The show was developed by actress and host [[Sara Gilbert]].

The show features [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Sheryl Underwood]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] (who also serves as the show's moderator) and [[Marie Osmond]]. They discuss the day's latest headlines, while usually tying in the show's theme of motherhood or at least parenthood, such as by giving their opinions \"through the eyes of mothers.\" The show also contains celebrity interviews and segments for mothers and parents in general.

''The Talk'' is broadcast before a live studio audience at the [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, California]] each Monday through Friday at 11:00 a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]], and airs live on most CBS [[owned-and-operated station]]s and [[network affiliate|affiliates]] in the [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] and [[Central United States]] at 2:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. The program is broadcast on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] elsewhere from the [[Mountain Time Zone]] westward. The Friday shows are recorded on Thursday afternoons at 1:00&nbsp;pm PT for broadcast the next day. Friday shows are taped before the same studio audience in attendance for the earlier live Thursday broadcast.

==Format==
''The Talk'' has a format similar in style to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''.  The opening segment of the broadcast is known as \"Everybody Talks\" and usually runs a combined 12 to 25 minutes over multiple segments, depending on the number of stories featured and the number of guests.  It is followed by topical discussion segments, involves the five-female host panel discussing current news items, typically focusing on [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headlines, offbeat stories, and celebrity news. The program also actively incorporates [[social media]] to allow viewers to provide their opinions on the stories discussed through [[Twitter]] (using the hashtag #EverybodyTalks, or alternately the abbreviated #EVBT).  In season five, the program began allowing viewers to use [[Instagram]] to record and upload videos using the aforementioned hashtags, with one or two videos being selected to air on the live broadcasts.<ref>{{cite press release|title=CBS's \"The Talk\" Kicks Off Season 5 Monday, Sept. 8!|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2014/09/02/cbss-the-talk-kicks-off-season-5-monday-sept-8-45010/20140902cbs01/|publisher=CBS|via=The Futon Critic|date=September 2, 2014|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}</ref>

On most editions, the \"Top Talker\" serves as the final segment of the topical discussion, featuring a rotating set of contributors - most of whom are correspondents/hosts of entertainment-related newsmagazine programs or magazines or hosts of local or syndicated radio programs - providing detailed analysis of a single trending, usually celebrity-related, story. Following the \"Everybody Talks\" segment, all five hosts interview one or two featured celebrity guests; most of these interviews are conducted at the set's roundtable. Musical performances are also occasionally included.

The show also regularly has a cooking segment two to four times each week, with two of the panelists - rotating between any combination of Chen, Underwood, Gilbert, or Osbourne - assisting in the preparation of the featured recipes with the guest chef. Product giveaways are also done once per week, as part of a segment showcasing fashion/beauty products and electronics that are given away to studio audience members for attending the show, and are often tied into online [[Deal of the day|flash sale]]s where the viewing audience can purchase the products offered at a reduced price.

To conclude the show through season 9, each episode signed-off with one of the co-hosts, primarily the moderator, saying \"Remember, it's always the right time to have ''The Talk!''\". With the start of season 10 the sign-off \"Let's Talk Tomorrow!\" or \"Let's Talk Later\" (used on Friday) is used.

==Development==
In December 2009, CBS announced the cancellation of ''[[As the World Turns]]'' after 54 years, and was looking for a program to replace the long-running [[soap opera]] in its time slot. Sara Gilbert approached CBS about producing a pilot that would feature six women talking about the day's headlines with opinions told through \"the eyes of mothers.\"<ref name = Mothers />

On July 21, 2010, CBS announced that it had picked up the show (by then, given the title ''The Talk''), beating out several other contenders, including a cooking show featuring [[Emeril Lagasse]]; ''Say It Now'', a talk show featuring [[Valerie Bertinelli]] and [[Rove McManus]]; and a revamped version of the classic game show ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'', hosted by [[Andy Richter]].<ref name=Mothers>{{cite web|title=Sara Gilbert talk show to replace veteran CBS soap|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/21/us-gilbert-idUSTRE66K5XA20100721|author=Georg Szalai|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=September 19, 2012|date=July 21, 2010}}</ref>

In the 4 weeks prior to the show's debut, new episodes of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', as well as repeats of ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', aired in the timeslot vacated by ''As the World Turns''.

On January 14, 2011, Marissa Jaret Winokur reported that she would not be returning to the show in 2011. In an exclusive statement to ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', original executive producer Brad Bessey said of Winokur's departure, \"We think the world of Marissa as a creative talent, on-air personality and super mom. This is a mutual decision based on time, not talent.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Hairspray's Marissa Jaret Winokur Exits CBS' \"The Talk\"|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/146759-Hairsprays-Marissa-Jaret-Winokur-Exits-CBS-The-Talk|author=Adam Hetrick|periodical=[[Playbill]]|publisher=Philip S Birsh (Rights and Permissions)|date=January 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Marissa Jaret Winokur Leaves 'The Talk'|url=http://www.popeater.com/2011/01/15/marissa-jaret-winokur-leaves-the-talk/|author=Christine Fenno|website=PopEater|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] ([[AOL]])|date=January 15, 2011|accessdate= April 11, 2014}}</ref>

===''The Talk After Dark''===
From January 12 to 16, 2015, CBS broadcast a special second \"[[late night television|late night]]\" edition of ''The Talk'' – unofficially titled ''The Talk After Dark'' - which filled the 12:37&nbsp;a.m. Eastern timeslot normally occupied by ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'' (which itself utilized [[List of The Late Late Show episodes (2015 guest hosts)|guest hosts]] on most other weeks in the four-month period between [[Craig Ferguson]]'s departure from ''The Late Late Show'' in December 2014 and the start of [[James Corden]]'s tenure as host of that program in March 2015). Recorded each afternoon that week before the studio audience in attendance for the earlier live daytime broadcasts for broadcast each night, the episodes featured a separate slate of guests and featured topics from the daytime editions, and featured a special [[house band]] exclusive to the late-night editions led by rock musician/songwriter [[Linda Perry]] (wife of series creator and co-host Sara Gilbert).<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Taps ‘The Talk’ and Guest Hosts To Fill ‘Late Late Show’|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/cbs-taps-the-talk-and-guest-hosts-to-fill-late-late-show-1201365480/|author=Brian Steinberg|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=November 26, 2014|accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Breaking News - Guests Announced for \"The Late Late Show\" with Guest Host Drew Carey (1/5-1/9) and After-Dark Edition of \"The Talk\" (1/12-1/16)|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2014/12/22/guests-announced-for-the-late-late-show-with-guest-host-drew-carey-1-5-1-9-and-after-dark-edition-of-the-talk-1-12-1-16-742210/20141222cbs01/|website=The Futon Critic|date=December 22, 2014|accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref>

===''The Talk: Keep Talking''===
From March 15 to 16, 2018 ''The Talk'' aired two exclusive episodes on their Facebook page entitled ''Keep Talking'' as CBS broadcast the [[NCAA March Madness]] games on the aforementioned dates. This special edition featured all five co-hosts communicating with their Facebook fans asking them personal questions and advice for their own personal problems.

===''The Talk: Chat Room''===
Carrie Ann Inaba originally announced on the March 12, 2020 episode that due to the [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]] The Talk will be shot without an audience. After CBS forced production to shut down Inaba took matters into her own hands by hosting a daily Instagram live from her own house (at the same time when the show originally airs) under self quarantine. CBS greenlit Inaba's daily [[Instagram]] live (now including all five co-hosts) into ''The Talk: Chat Room'' as production was shut down. Guests on this version included [[Raven Symone]], [[Dr. Phil]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[The Bella Twins]] and [[Tyra Banks]].

===''The Talk: @Home''===
Due to the global Covid-19 pandemic CBS halted the in-studio production of The Talk. On March 30, 2020 the show began using the [[Zoom Video Communications|Zoom]] platform allowing the shows host (and guests) to broadcast from their homes. The format of the show remains the same starting with discussions from trending current events, host discussions, and having guest join who are also using the same video platform. The @Home format arose from the hosts doing a daily [[Instagram]] broadcast each day at the same time the show was scheduled to air. The Talk will continue to use the @Home format for the foreseeable future.

==Appearances in other media==
On March 14, 2016, all of ''The Talk'' hosts (including then host [[Aisha Tyler]]) made a cameo on ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' in the episode \"Falling\" when [[Cat Grant]] (played by [[Calista Flockhart]]) made a guest appearance on ''The Talk''. On December 15, 2017, [[Julie Chen]] revealed that all of the current hosts of The Talk (including new co-host [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]]) will be featured on an episode of [[Jane the Virgin]] as themselves which was directed by [[Gina Rodriguez]]. On January 10, 2018, ''The Talk'' revealed on their Instagram and Snapchat stories they filmed their episode of ''Jane the Virgin'' on the set of ''The Talk'' right after filming the show for the aforementioned date. On February 9, 2018, Rodriguez made a guest appearance on the show to announce the episode featuring the ladies of ''The Talk'', called \"Chapter Seventy-Four\" would air that night.

===Criticism===
''The Talk'' was criticized for a segment where some panelists made light of male genital mutilation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hughes|first=Sarah|title=‘The Talk’ ladies under fire for laughing at Catherine Kieu story (Video)|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/the-talk-ladies-under-fire-for-laughing-at-catherine-kieu-story-video/2011/07/18/gIQA3OjkLI_blog.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Adams Publishing Group]]|accessdate=July 18, 2011}}</ref> Osbourne said, \"However, I do think it is quite fabulous\" in response to a story where a wife had drugged her husband, cut off his penis, and put it in the garbage disposal due to his filing for divorce. An apology was made during a subsequent show.

The failure to disclose on-air as to why Remini and Robinson Peete were released or even mention them brought about criticism of the show from some viewers, with some fans of the two stars protesting their dismissals.<ref>{{cite news|title='The Talk' Debuts Without Leah Remini and Holly Robinson Peete: What the Viewers Are Saying|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/talk-debuts-leah-remini-holly-231686|author=Jethro Nede|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=September 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='The Talk' Without Leah Remini and Holly Robinson Peete: What THR Readers Are Saying |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/talk-leah-remini-holly-robinson-232147|author=Jethro Nede|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=September 6, 2011}}</ref>

==Incident==
===Background===
;National politics and blasphemy
In March 2017, the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif [[Internet censorship in Pakistan|supported a crackdown]] on blasphemous material posted on social media and described blasphemy as an \"unpardonable offence\".<ref name=\"bbc/13april2017\" /><ref>{{cite news|title=Pakistani student accused of blasphemy beaten to death on campus|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-blasphemy-idUSKBN17F1ZL|accessdate=15 April 2017|work=Reuters|date=13 April 2017}}</ref>

;Mashal Khan criticisms of AWK University's administrators
Before his death Mashal Khan criticized the Abdul Wali Khan University but none of his comments mentioned religion or contained blasphemy. He revealed that the vice-chancellor never attended the university and students were forced to study in uncertainty of whether or not they would receive the degrees for which they were studying. He criticised teachers, accused them of bureaucracy and said that a single faculty member was in charge of multiple responsibilities. According to him \"everyone in authority is a thief here.\" The way the university collected outstanding dues was also criticised as it charged students Rs. 25,000, while other universities only collected Rs. 5,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mashal Khan Revealed Shocking Details About His University In An Interview Before His Death!|url=https://www.parhlo.com/mashal-khan-interview/|accessdate=24 April 2017}}</ref>

==Mashal Khan's funeral==
On the following day (14 April), Mashal Khan's funeral was led by his father, a local poet. Most neighbours kept away from the funeral, as threats made earlier by a local to anyone attending led them to fear follow-up attacks from religious mobs.<ref name=\"Yousafzai\">{{citation|title=I attended Mashal Khan's funeral prayer, when others refused: Sherin Yousafzai|last=Yousafzai|first=Sherin |url=https://www.geo.tv/latest/138922-I-attended-Mashal-Khans-funeral-prayers-when-others-refused|year=2017}}</ref> Some elders nevertheless joined, calling over neighbours to show support and a few dozen people eventually joined the procession.<ref name=\"Yousafzai\" /> In the following days, as information and national support emerged, neighbours expressed regret for not being able to protect Mashal nor supporting the Khans more on the day of the funeral.<ref name=\"KhanM0421\" />

==Investigation and arrests==
Following the death of Khan, at least 61 people were arrested.<ref name=\"wiki12\" />

===Initial Investigation===
According to police investigations, Mashal Khan had not carried out any blasphemous action. The Inspector General Police stated \"We did not find any concrete evidence under which an investigation or legal action can be launched against Mashal, Abdullah or Zubair\".<ref name=\"Bangash0417\"/>

According to Abdullah, the AWK University's administration summoned him to the Mass Communications chairman's office, where they pressured him into accusing Mashal of blasphemy.<ref name=\"Bangash0417\" /> When Abdullah refused as \"Neither Mashal nor I had committed any blasphemy\", the administration issued the online notification, then went to punish Abdullah by beating and Mashal by lynching.<ref name=\"Bangash0417\" />

According to the testimony of one of the prime accused, Wajahat Ullah, collected by the police, 15 to 20 persons were at the office of the chairman discussing the three students' controversial views when he was called over by fellow student Mudassar Bashir, the representative of the class.<ref name=\"Ali04\">{{citation|last=Ali|first=Arshad|year=2017|title=Mardan University security incharge incited mob to murder Mashal: prime accused|url=http://khybernews.tv/76681-2/}}</ref> Lecturers Ziaullah Hamdard and Pir Asfandyar, clerks Anees, Saeed and Idrees, and superintendent Arshad were present and summoned him on the issue. Class representative Mudassar Bashir asked him to become a witness of the alleged blasphemy, while clerk Idrees repeated his opposition to having a communist in AWK University.<ref name=\"Ali04\" /> The proposition of creating a committee of inquiry was opposed by clerk Idrees and class leader Bashir, while security in-charge Bilal Bakhsh declared his will to handle the issue quickly, occasionally stating his will to kill the student.<ref name=\"Ali04\" /> The group processed toward Mashal's hostel, calling for bystanders to join and turning the expedition into an angry punitive mob.<ref name=\"Bangash0417\" />

===Arrests===

===JIT Report===
The 13-member Joint Investigation Team (JIT) constituted by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] in response to the lynching gave its final report on 3 June 2017. The report cleared Mashal of all blasphemy charges and termed his lynching a premeditated murder conducted by certain elements in the student body and the university administration. The report also cleared Mashal's two friends, Abdullah and Zubair, of any blasphemy while raising questions about the efficacy of Mardan Police's response to the incident.<ref name=\"trib\">{{cite web|last1=Firdous|first1=Iftikhar|title=Plot to 'get rid of' Mashal Khan was hatched a month before murder, concludes JIT|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1427069/plot-get-rid-mashal-khan-hatched-month-murder-concludes-jit/|website=The Express Tribune|date=4 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"ptoday\">{{cite web|title=JIT finds a student group incited mob against Mashal|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/06/04/jit-finds-a-student-group-incited-mob-against-mashal/|website=Pakistan Today}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Akbar|first1=Ali|title=Mashal murder case: JIT finds group in university incited mob against student on pretext of blasphemy|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1337373/mashal-murder-case-jit-finds-group-in-university-incited-mob-against-student-on-pretext-of-blasphemy|website=Dawn.com|date=4 June 2017}}</ref>

According to the report, the two prime inciters of the lynching were Sabir Mayer, president of the [[Pukhtoon Students Federation]], and Ajmal Khan, president of the university's employee union. Ajmal confessed that a month before the lynching, Sabir, along with a university employee, Asad Katlang, came to his office and told him that they had to \"get rid of Mashal\" as he was a \"threat to the party\" (the 'party' is presumed to be the leftist political party, [[Awami National Party]], whose student federation Sabir headed). The trio then proceeded to hatch a plan for Mashal's murder.<ref name=\"trib\" />

As stated in the report, the prime reason for Mashal's lynching was his constant criticism of the university's administration. A month before his lynching, he gave a television interview to [[AVT Khyber]], a regional news channel, in which he alleged that illegal and criminal activities persisted in the university hostel and female students were also exploited in the university.<ref name=\"ptoday\" />

It was further found that the university had serious management issues where top posts were filled by people of criminal background due to their political affiliation. It has been suggested in the report that strict departmental action should be taken against registrar Sher Alam, director administration Peer Asfandyar, chief security officer Inayatullah Afridi, provost Fayaz Ali Shah, chief proctor professor Idrees, director sports professor Farooq and assistant registrar Humyaun for their incompetence.<ref name=\"trib\" />

In its conclusion, the report, which will be submitted to the Supreme Court and the anti-terrorism court (ATC), has suggested severe punishments for the university employees and students involved in the crime.<ref name=\"trib\" />

===Anti-Terrorism Court proceedings===
On 7 February 2018, Anti-Terrorism court awarded death penalty to prime suspect Imran Ali. Imran Ali had confessed that he had shot Mashal Khan. 5 other convicts named Bilal Bakhsh, Fazal-i-Raziq, Mujeebullah, Ishfaq Khan and Mudassir Bashir were awarded life-time imprisonment. 25 other convicts were awarded 4 year jail sentences.<ref name=\"wiki13\"/> 4 other suspects were on the run who later surrendered to police on June 2018. Their trial took place on 21 March 2019. Two of the suspects named Arif Khan and Asad Khan were awarded life imprisonment in the Mashal Khan lynching case.<ref name=\"wiki14\"/><ref name=\"wiki15\"/> While two others named Sabir Mayar and Izharullah were acquitted over lack of evidence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1470986/pti-councillor-among-two-more-men-handed-life-in-jail-over-lynching-of-mashal-khan|title=PTI councillor among two more men handed life in jail over lynching of Mashal Khan|date=21 March 2019|work=Dawn News}}</ref> Father of Mashal Khan expressed satisfaction with the Anti-Terrorism verdict.

==Incident==
===Background===
;National politics and blasphemy
In March 2017, the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif [[Internet censorship in Pakistan|supported a crackdown]] on blasphemous material posted on social media and described blasphemy as an \"unpardonable offence\".<ref name=\"bbc/13april2017\" /><ref>{{cite news|title=Pakistani student accused of blasphemy beaten to death on campus|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-blasphemy-idUSKBN17F1ZL|accessdate=15 April 2017|work=Reuters|date=13 April 2017}}</ref>

;Mashal Khan criticisms of AWK University's administrators
Before his death Mashal Khan criticized the Abdul Wali Khan University but none of his comments mentioned religion or contained blasphemy. He revealed that the vice-chancellor never attended the university and students were forced to study in uncertainty of whether or not they would receive the degrees for which they were studying. He criticised teachers, accused them of bureaucracy and said that a single faculty member was in charge of multiple responsibilities. According to him \"everyone in authority is a thief here.\" The way the university collected outstanding dues was also criticised as it charged students Rs. 25,000, while other universities only collected Rs. 5,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mashal Khan Revealed Shocking Details About His University In An Interview Before His Death!|url=https://www.parhlo.com/mashal-khan-interview/|accessdate=24 April 2017}}</ref>

==Mashal Khan's funeral==
On the following day (14 April), Mashal Khan's funeral was led by his father, a local poet. Most neighbours kept away from the funeral, as threats made earlier by a local to anyone attending led them to fear follow-up attacks from religious mobs.<ref name=\"Yousafzai\">{{citation|title=I attended Mashal Khan's funeral prayer, when others refused: Sherin Yousafzai|last=Yousafzai|first=Sherin |url=https://www.geo.tv/latest/138922-I-attended-Mashal-Khans-funeral-prayers-when-others-refused|year=2017}}</ref> Some elders nevertheless joined, calling over neighbours to show support and a few dozen people eventually joined the procession.<ref name=\"Yousafzai\" /> In the following days, as information and national support emerged, neighbours expressed regret for not being able to protect Mashal nor supporting the Khans more on the day of the funeral.<ref name=\"KhanM0421\" />

==Investigation and arrests==
Following the death of Khan, at least 61 people were arrested.<ref name=\"wiki12\" />

===Initial Investigation===
According to police investigations, Mashal Khan had not carried out any blasphemous action. The Inspector General Police stated \"We did not find any concrete evidence under which an investigation or legal action can be launched against Mashal, Abdullah or Zubair\".<ref name=\"Bangash0417\"/>

According to Abdullah, the AWK University's administration summoned him to the Mass Communications chairman's office, where they pressured him into accusing Mashal of blasphemy.<ref name=\"Bangash0417\" /> When Abdullah refused as \"Neither Mashal nor I had committed any blasphemy\", the administration issued the online notification, then went to punish Abdullah by beating and Mashal by lynching.<ref name=\"Bangash0417\" />

According to the testimony of one of the prime accused, Wajahat Ullah, collected by the police, 15 to 20 persons were at the office of the chairman discussing the three students' controversial views when he was called over by fellow student Mudassar Bashir, the representative of the class.<ref name=\"Ali04\">{{citation|last=Ali|first=Arshad|year=2017|title=Mardan University security incharge incited mob to murder Mashal: prime accused|url=http://khybernews.tv/76681-2/}}</ref> Lecturers Ziaullah Hamdard and Pir Asfandyar, clerks Anees, Saeed and Idrees, and superintendent Arshad were present and summoned him on the issue. Class representative Mudassar Bashir asked him to become a witness of the alleged blasphemy, while clerk Idrees repeated his opposition to having a communist in AWK University.<ref name=\"Ali04\" /> The proposition of creating a committee of inquiry was opposed by clerk Idrees and class leader Bashir, while security in-charge Bilal Bakhsh declared his will to handle the issue quickly, occasionally stating his will to kill the student.<ref name=\"Ali04\" /> The group processed toward Mashal's hostel, calling for bystanders to join and turning the expedition into an angry punitive mob.<ref name=\"Bangash0417\" />

===JIT Report===
The 13-member Joint Investigation Team (JIT) constituted by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] in response to the lynching gave its final report on 3 June 2017. The report cleared Mashal of all blasphemy charges and termed his lynching a premeditated murder conducted by certain elements in the student body and the university administration. The report also cleared Mashal's two friends, Abdullah and Zubair, of any blasphemy while raising questions about the efficacy of Mardan Police's response to the incident.<ref name=\"trib\">{{cite web|last1=Firdous|first1=Iftikhar|title=Plot to 'get rid of' Mashal Khan was hatched a month before murder, concludes JIT|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1427069/plot-get-rid-mashal-khan-hatched-month-murder-concludes-jit/|website=The Express Tribune|date=4 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"ptoday\">{{cite web|title=JIT finds a student group incited mob against Mashal|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/06/04/jit-finds-a-student-group-incited-mob-against-mashal/|website=Pakistan Today}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Akbar|first1=Ali|title=Mashal murder case: JIT finds group in university incited mob against student on pretext of blasphemy|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1337373/mashal-murder-case-jit-finds-group-in-university-incited-mob-against-student-on-pretext-of-blasphemy|website=Dawn.com|date=4 June 2017}}</ref>

According to the report, the two prime inciters of the lynching were Sabir Mayer, president of the [[Pukhtoon Students Federation]], and Ajmal Khan, president of the university's employee union. Ajmal confessed that a month before the lynching, Sabir, along with a university employee, Asad Katlang, came to his office and told him that they had to \"get rid of Mashal\" as he was a \"threat to the party\" (the 'party' is presumed to be the leftist political party, [[Awami National Party]], whose student federation Sabir headed). The trio then proceeded to hatch a plan for Mashal's murder.<ref name=\"trib\" />

As stated in the report, the prime reason for Mashal's lynching was his constant criticism of the university's administration. A month before his lynching, he gave a television interview to [[AVT Khyber]], a regional news channel, in which he alleged that illegal and criminal activities persisted in the university hostel and female students were also exploited in the university.<ref name=\"ptoday\" />

It was further found that the university had serious management issues where top posts were filled by people of criminal background due to their political affiliation. It has been suggested in the report that strict departmental action should be taken against registrar Sher Alam, director administration Peer Asfandyar, chief security officer Inayatullah Afridi, provost Fayaz Ali Shah, chief proctor professor Idrees, director sports professor Farooq and assistant registrar Humyaun for their incompetence.<ref name=\"trib\" />

In its conclusion, the report, which will be submitted to the Supreme Court and the anti-terrorism court (ATC), has suggested severe punishments for the university employees and students involved in the crime.<ref name=\"trib\" />

===Anti-Terrorism Court proceedings===
On 7 February 2018, Anti-Terrorism court awarded death penalty to prime suspect Imran Ali. Imran Ali had confessed that he had shot Mashal Khan. 5 other convicts named Bilal Bakhsh, Fazal-i-Raziq, Mujeebullah, Ishfaq Khan and Mudassir Bashir were awarded life-time imprisonment. 25 other convicts were awarded 4 year jail sentences.<ref name=\"wiki13\"/> 4 other suspects were on the run who later surrendered to police on June 2018.

[[File:SZRozycki1966.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Professor Stefan Zbigniew Różycki in Hungary, 1966. Różycki named the Ciechocinek formation in 1958.]]
Several works were done in the 1920s on the Jurassic sediments of Poland, where the main stages, specially Lias and Dogger where stablished. At the same time, facies along the Town of [[Ciechocinek]] where classified as possible Lias-Dogger transition, without anything more clear after this.<ref>LEWIÑSKI J. 1928 – Jura i kajper w g³êbokim wierceniu w Czêstochowie.

===Lithology===
[[File:Kamieniołom Wapienno 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, where strata of the Formation emerges. Plant matter & Fish Teeth have been found here.]]
The Ciechocinek is composed mostly by muds and silts, along with poorly consolidated [[Mudstone]]s and [[Siltstone]]s with lenses and subordinate intercalations of fine-grained sandy lenses, typically from 1 mm to less 20 cm thick, extended a few meters, along also with sandstones. Diagenetic [[Siderite]] intercalations and concretions, ~20 cm thick, as well as [[Pyrite]] concretions are also present.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The mineralization 
of Siderite occurs in all types of Ciechocinek Formation deposits. Include fine crystalline variety, coarse crystalline rhombohedra and fine crystalline aggregates impregnated by mixture of un de termined Fehydroxides.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> The mineralization of the siedrites on certain layers is associated to the abundance of organic matter, with the deacay of it ending on a progressive carbonate supersaturation, with an early precipitation on the nucleous of the siderites. They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to thepure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are from rare o extremely rare. Mudstones are porrly consolidated, tren to disintegration, swell and become plastic, being the only exceptional ones those the heavy sideritic mudstones, that range froma wide variety of colors, from  brown or cherry-red in colour, with an olive shade often appearing.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> On the other hand, there are abundant poorly consolidated [[Quartz]] sandstones, that are regularly intercalated with [[Silt]] and [[Siltstone]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Along the Sandstones, there are [[Chlorite]] and [[Kaolinite]] grains. Plant microremains are common, concentrated with mica flakes on lamination planes, while larger wood fragments, several cm long, are also moderately frequent.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Heavy minerals are present and include as the most common [[Euhedral]] forms such as [[Zircon]], [[Rutile]] and [[Tourmaline]], along with angular fragments of [[Rutile]], [[Garnet]] and [[Staurolite]], with finally well-rounded oval grains of Zircon, Rutile, Garnet and Tourmaline. Outside the main heavy minerals, it is possible to find well-rounded grains of green [[Hornblende]], [[Apatite]], [[Disthene]], [[Epidote]], and finally on one study one [[Pyroxene]] grain was found.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The presence of [[Kaolinite]], related to continental formation in tropical climate environments for the chemical weathering of different igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, along with [[Chlorite]] & [[Biotite]], suggest a deposition linked to fluvial & deltaic forces. The eastern Sudetes and their foreland are the best candidates for be the origin of the transported material, as they have a nearly identical composition, being the Lower Jurassic deposits in the [[Fore-Sudetic Monocline]] linked [[Cracow-Czêstochowa Monocline]], with the strata of the Formation.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> 

===Stratigraphy===
[[File:Wapienno - kamieniołomy Cementowni Kujawy - Lafarge Cement 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, with exposed strata of the Formation.]]
Deposits of the Ciechocinek Formation are related to a brackish-marine origin, being  deposited in an epicontinental sedimentary basin on Poland, that was the eastern arm of the Mid-European [[Toarcian]] Basin.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/>  The main component of the deposits are muds,  intercalate sandstones & silts disposed on a high variety of structures, with at least twelve lithofacies that run from fine-grained sedimentations to wave dominated [[Sandy Shoal]]s. It is believed that the dominat sedimentation was by quiet [[Mud]] and silt sedimentation from suspension, which probably come from near [[River Mouths]].  It was a sedimentary basin with a continuous influx of [[Clay]] and fine [[Silt]], to which sand was brought by events such as river transportation, storms, eustatic effects, and other related.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\">Leonowicz, P. (2011). Sedimentation of Lower Toarcian (Lower Jurassic) brackish deposits from the Częstochowa-Wieluń region (SW Poland). Acta Geologica Polonica, 61(2), 215-241.</ref> There is a detailed succession of changes in the strata with time, where the location of the river mouths shifted because of effects such as the progradation of deltas, the stop of the flux of river channels and the long-lasting esutatic sea-level changes, all of that can be confirmed by the presence of microstructures as result of erosion and cross lamination in the mud-silt facies.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> A [[Marine Transgression]] correlated to the rise of the sea level on the Lower Toarcian is crearly visible on the [[Silesian-Cracow]] area, where the sea encroached the [[Polish Trough]], which resulted in the end of the [[Pliensbachian]] alluvial sedimentation, that can be observed on the underliying [[Blanowice Formation]]. The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to Floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers 
is observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continue on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, impliying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents. Mostly of the Invertebrate traces reported from the formation, come from this layers.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On the upper levels of the formation there is a clear change in the sedimentation: a sea regression with a paulatine alluvial progradation. The sea left seashore lakes, lagoons, deltas, Mangrooves, with the emergence of the land confirmed by the occurrence of plant roots and [[Desiccation Cracks]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/>

==Paleoenvironment==
[[File:Ciechocinek Formation Reconstruction.jpg|thumb|450px|left|Environment reconstruction of the Polish realm, based on several footprints, fragmentary specimens and fossil plants reported]]

The presence of green facies in modern Polish Realm is related to an ancient ironstone paleoenvironment, with shallow marine facies that show a decreasing presence of iron.<ref name=Leonowicz></ref> The occurrence of this type of deposit in modern strata is related to intertropical regions on the vicinity of river mouths. Those relation made attribute the strata to a deposition on a warm and really humid climate, with  brackish-marine environments  consisting of [[lagoon]]s, [[embayment]]s, [[estuaries]], [[mangrove]]s, low-energy deltas and near sandwave fields or barrier islands, similar to modern [[Caribe Sea]] islands and seashore environments.<ref name=Leonowicz></ref> The Ciechocinek Formation on the Polish Basin mainly represents a large and shallow brackish embayment, with a lower part  deposited in a restricted offshore environment,  with lagoonal, deltaic and other seashore deposits, that translate to a deeper, nearly fully-marine environment in the Pomeranian region.<ref name=BRAŃSKI>BRAŃSKI, P.

Volumina Jurassica, 10(10), 1-24.</ref>  The Presence of abundant clay on the marine deposits suggest a great flux of terrestrial facies.<ref name=BRAŃSKI/> The high presence of Kaolinite on the strata of th formation suggest a biochemical weathering in Tropical or Humid-subtropical climate with perennial rainfall, as modern Kaolinite deposits are typically present Humid Jungle settings.<ref name=BRAŃSKI/> that develop as a result of intense The humidity of the environments was proved by the presence of several fossils and minerals on the strata outside the measurements of the iron precipitation. Organic matter is of [[Type III Kerogen]], with fragments of microscopic plants and several traces of organic matter. Fungal material is present, where is shown how an increase on the number of specimens can be linked to the climate change on the lower Toarcian.<ref>Pieńkowski, G., Hodbod, M., & Ullmann, C. V. (2016). Fungal decomposition of terrestrial organic matter accelerated Early Jurassic climate warming. Scientific reports, 6(1), 1-11.</ref> Beyond that, by the use of clay mineral data was possible to stablish how the changes on the early Toarcian affected the [[Polish Basin]]: the increasing warming temperatures where measures by changes on the Kaolinite deposition on the polish margin of the Formation, where is exposed that the subtropical climate of the region was affected by runoffs from the Tethyan realms, with the super-greenhouse/[[Anoxic event]] event linked to methane expulsion. There was a decline in rainfalls towards the [[Tenuicostatum]]-[[Falciferum]] boundary, exposing a transition to less humid conditions, noted by the decreasing amount of Kaolinite.<ref name=BRAŃSKI/>

[[File:SZRozycki1966.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Professor Stefan Zbigniew Różycki in Hungary, 1966. Różycki named the Ciechocinek formation in 1958.]]
Several works were done in the 1920s on the Jurassic sediments of Poland, where the main stages, specially Lias and Dogger where stablished. At the same time, facies along the Town of [[Ciechocinek]] where classified as possible Lias-Dogger transition, without anything more clear after this.<ref>LEWIÑSKI J. 1928 – Jura i kajper w g³êbokim wierceniu w Czêstochowie.

===Lithology===
[[File:Kamieniołom Wapienno 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, where strata of the Formation emerges. Plant matter & Fish Teeth have been found here.]]
The Ciechocinek is composed mostly by muds and silts, along with poorly consolidated [[Mudstone]]s and [[Siltstone]]s with lenses and subordinate intercalations of fine-grained sandy lenses, typically from 1 mm to less 20 cm thick, extended a few meters, along also with sandstones. Diagenetic [[Siderite]] intercalations and concretions, ~20 cm thick, as well as [[Pyrite]] concretions are also present.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The mineralization 
of Siderite occurs in all types of Ciechocinek Formation deposits. Include fine crystalline variety, coarse crystalline rhombohedra and fine crystalline aggregates impregnated by mixture of un de termined Fehydroxides.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> The mineralization of the siedrites on certain layers is associated to the abundance of organic matter, with the deacay of it ending on a progressive carbonate supersaturation, with an early precipitation on the nucleous of the siderites. They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to thepure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are from rare o extremely rare. Mudstones are porrly consolidated, tren to disintegration, swell and become plastic, being the only exceptional ones those the heavy sideritic mudstones, that range froma wide variety of colors, from  brown or cherry-red in colour, with an olive shade often appearing.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> On the other hand, there are abundant poorly consolidated [[Quartz]] sandstones, that are regularly intercalated with [[Silt]] and [[Siltstone]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Along the Sandstones, there are [[Chlorite]] and [[Kaolinite]] grains. Plant microremains are common, concentrated with mica flakes on lamination planes, while larger wood fragments, several cm long, are also moderately frequent.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Heavy minerals are present and include as the most common [[Euhedral]] forms such as [[Zircon]], [[Rutile]] and [[Tourmaline]], along with angular fragments of [[Rutile]], [[Garnet]] and [[Staurolite]], with finally well-rounded oval grains of Zircon, Rutile, Garnet and Tourmaline. Outside the main heavy minerals, it is possible to find well-rounded grains of green [[Hornblende]], [[Apatite]], [[Disthene]], [[Epidote]], and finally on one study one [[Pyroxene]] grain was found.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The presence of [[Kaolinite]], related to continental formation in tropical climate environments for the chemical weathering of different igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, along with [[Chlorite]] & [[Biotite]], suggest a deposition linked to fluvial & deltaic forces. The eastern Sudetes and their foreland are the best candidates for be the origin of the transported material, as they have a nearly identical composition, being the Lower Jurassic deposits in the [[Fore-Sudetic Monocline]] linked [[Cracow-Czêstochowa Monocline]], with the strata of the Formation.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/>

Deposits of the Ciechocinek Formation are related to a brackish-marine origin, being  deposited in an epicontinental sedimentary basin on Poland, that was the eastern arm of the Mid-European [[Toarcian]] Basin.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/>  The main component of the deposits are muds,  intercalate sandstones & silts disposed on a high variety of structures, with at least twelve lithofacies that run from fine-grained sedimentations to wave dominated [[Sandy Shoal]]s. It is believed that the dominat sedimentation was by quiet [[Mud]] and silt sedimentation from suspension, which probably come from near [[River Mouths]].  It was a sedimentary basin with a continuous influx of [[Clay]] and fine [[Silt]], to which sand was brought by events such as river transportation, storms, eustatic effects, and other related.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\">Leonowicz, P. (2011). Sedimentation of Lower Toarcian (Lower Jurassic) brackish deposits from the Częstochowa-Wieluń region (SW Poland). Acta Geologica Polonica, 61(2), 215-241.</ref> There is a detailed succession of changes in the strata with time, where the location of the river mouths shifted because of effects such as the progradation of deltas, the stop of the flux of river channels and the long-lasting esutatic sea-level changes, all of that can be confirmed by the presence of microstructures as result of erosion and cross lamination in the mud-silt facies.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> A [[Marine Transgression]] correlated to the rise of the sea level on the Lower Toarcian is crearly visible on the [[Silesian-Cracow]] area, where the sea encroached the [[Polish Trough]], which resulted in the end of the [[Pliensbachian]] alluvial sedimentation, that can be observed on the underliying [[Blanowice Formation]]. The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to Floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers 
is observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continue on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, impliying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents. Mostly of the Invertebrate traces reported from the formation, come from this layers.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On the upper levels of the formation there is a clear change in the sedimentation: a sea regression with a paulatine alluvial progradation. The sea left seashore lakes, lagoons, deltas, Mangrooves, with the emergence of the land confirmed by the occurrence of plant roots and [[Desiccation Cracks]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/>

[[File:Ciechocinek Formation Reconstruction.jpg|thumb|450px|left|Environment reconstruction of the Polish realm, based on several footprints, fragmentary specimens and fossil plants reported]]

The presence of verdine{{what|date=April 2020}} facies in modern Polish Realm is vinculated{{what|date=April 2020}} to an ancient ironstone paleoenvironment, with shallow marine facies that expose carence{{what|date=April 2020}} of iron.<ref name=Leonowicz></ref> The occurrence of this type of deposit in modern strata is vinculated{{what|date=April 2020}} to intertropical regions on the vicinity of river mouths. Those relation made attribute the strata to a deposition on a warm and really humid climate, with  brackish-marine environments  consisting of [[lagoon]]s, [[embayment]]s, [[estuaries]], [[mangrove]]s, low-energy deltas and near sandwave fields or barrier islands, similar to modern [[Caribe]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} islands and seashore environments.<ref name=Leonowicz></ref> The humidity of the environments was proved by the presence of several fossils and minerals on the strata outside the measurements of the iron precipitation. Organic matter is of [[Type III Kerogen]], with fragments of microscopic plants and several traces of organic matter.

There was a decline in rainfalls towards the [[Tenuicostatum]]-[[Falciferum]] boundary, exposing a transition to less humid conditions.<ref>BRAŃSKI, P. (2012).

The '''papal tombs in old St. Peter's Basilica''' were the final resting places of the [[pope]]s, most of which dated from the fifth to sixteenth centuries. The majority of these tombs were destroyed during the sixteenth through seventeenth century demolition of [[old St. Peter's Basilica]], except for one which was destroyed during the [[Arab raid against Rome|Saracen Sack of the church]] in 846. The remainder were transferred in part to new [[St. Peter's Basilica]], which stands on the site of the original basilica, and a handful of other [[churches of Rome]].

==History==
Along with the repeated translations from the ancient [[catacombs of Rome]] and two fourteenth century fires in the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]], the rebuilding of St. Peter's is responsible for the destruction of approximately half of all [[List of extant papal tombs|papal tombs]]. As a result, [[Donato Bramante]], the chief architect of modern St. Peter's Basilica, has been remembered as \"''Mastro Ruinante''\".

Although the original basilica's construction was begun during the reign of emperor [[Constantine I]] and completed in the fourth century, [[Pope Leo I]] (440–461) was the first pope buried in the Constantian basilica.<ref name=\"rear40\">Reardon, 2004, p. 40.</ref> Over the centuries, both the atrium, chapels, and the nave of the basilica were packed with papal tombs, which were juggled between different sections of the church as construction took place on each section of the basilica. All that remains of the original tombs are a few sarcophagi and sculptural fragments.<ref name=\"r272\">Reardon, 2004, p. 272.</ref> Allegedly, [[Pope Julius II]], the pope who initiated the destruction of the Constantinian basilica, wished to clear space for a \"monstrous\" tomb of his own by [[Michelangelo]].<ref name=\"r274\">Reardon, 2004, p. 274.</ref>

Very little is known about the placement and appearance of the original tombs: one of the most valuable accounts is that of church canon and historian [[Giacomo Grimaldi]] (a senator of Genoa and the father of [[Girolamo Grimaldi-Cavalleroni]]), who sketched the tombs as they were moved around the basilica on the way to their destruction;<ref>Grimaldi, Giacomo. Ed. R. Niggl. 1972. ''Descrizione della Basilica Antica di S. Pietro in Vaticano: Codice Barberini Latino 2733''. Vatican City.</ref> Grimaldi's sketches record the shape and complexity of the early tombs, many of which were three-tiered.<ref name=\"r272\"/> A few destroyed papal tombs are also detailed in the writings of [[Alphonsus Ciacconius]].<ref>Reardon, 2004, p. 12.</ref>

Not all popes were buried in Rome. ''See [[list of non-extant papal tombs]]''

The '''papal tombs in old St. Peter's Basilica''' were the final resting places of the [[pope]]s, most which dated from the fifth to sixteenth centuries. The majority of these tombs were destroyed during the sixteenth through seventeenth century demolition of [[old St. Peter's Basilica]], except for one which was destroyed during the [[Arab raid against Rome|Saracen Sack of the church]] in 846. The remainder were transferred in part to new [[St. Peter's Basilica]], which stands on the site of the original basilica, and a handful of other [[churches of Rome]].

==History==
Along with the repeated translations from the ancient [[catacombs of Rome]] and two fourteenth century fires in the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]], the rebuilding of St. Peter's is responsible for the destruction of approximately half of all [[List of extant papal tombs|papal tombs]]. As a result, [[Donato Bramante]], the chief architect of modern St. Peter's Basilica, has been remembered as \"''Mastro Ruinante''\".

Although the original basilica's construction was begun during the reign of emperor [[Constantine I]] and completed in the fourth century, [[Pope Leo I]] (440–461) was the first pope buried in the Constantian basilica.<ref name=\"rear40\">Reardon, 2004, p. 40.</ref> Over the centuries, both the atrium, chapels, and the nave of the basilica were packed with papal tombs, which were juggled between different sections of the church as construction took place on each section of the basilica. All that remains of the original tombs are a few sarcophagi and sculptural fragments.<ref name=\"r272\">Reardon, 2004, p. 272.</ref> Allegedly, [[Pope Julius II]], the pope who initiated the destruction of the Constantinian basilica, wished to clear space for a \"monstrous\" tomb of his own by [[Michelangelo]].<ref name=\"r274\">Reardon, 2004, p. 274.</ref>

Very little is known about the placement and appearance of the original tombs: one of the most valuable accounts is that of church canon and historian [[Giacomo Grimaldi]] (a senator of Genoa and the father of [[Girolamo Grimaldi-Cavalleroni]]), who sketched the tombs as they were moved around the basilica on the way to their destruction;<ref>Grimaldi, Giacomo. Ed. R. Niggl. 1972. ''Descrizione della Basilica Antica di S. Pietro in Vaticano: Codice Barberini Latino 2733''. Vatican City.</ref> Grimaldi's sketches record the shape and complexity of the early tombs, many of which were three-tiered.<ref name=\"r272\"/> A few destroyed papal tombs are also detailed in the writings of [[Alphonsus Ciacconius]].<ref>Reardon, 2004, p. 12.</ref>

Not all popes were buried in Rome. ''See [[list of non-extant papal tombs]]''

'''Gaithersburg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|eɪ|ð|ər|z|.|b|ər|g}} {{pronunciation|Pronunciation of \"Gaithersburg\" (city in Maryland).ogg}}), officially the '''City of Gaithersburg''', is a city in [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], [[Maryland]], United States. At the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], Gaithersburg had a population of 59,933, making it the fourth-largest incorporated city in the state, behind [[Baltimore]], [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], and [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]].<ref>[https://www.census.gov U.S. Census website], U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved June 17, 2011.</ref> Gaithersburg is located to the northwest of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and is considered a suburb and a primary city within the [[Washington metropolitan area|Washington–Arlington–Alexandria, DC–VA–MD–WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Gaithersburg was incorporated as a town in 1878 and as a city in 1968.

Gaithersburg is divided into east and west sections, separated by [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]]. The eastern section of the city is older and is the original portion of the town before more recent growth. Landmarks and buildings from that time can still be seen in many places but especially in the historic central business district of Gaithersburg called \"Olde Towne\". The east side also includes [[Lakeforest Mall]], City Hall, and the Montgomery County Fair grounds, and Bohrer Park (a well-known joint community recreation center and outdoor water park for kids and families). The west side of the city has many wealthier neighborhoods that were designed with smart growth techniques and embrace [[New Urbanism]].  These include the award-winning [[Kentlands]] community, the Lakelands community, and the Washingtonian Center (better known as Rio), a popular shopping/business district. Consumers often come to this area during Black Friday and other shopping holidays for the deals and variety of huge brand name stores like Target and Dick's Sporting Goods, and smaller stores like Francesca's and Blue Mercury.  Two New Urbanism communities are under construction, including [[Watkins Mill Town Center]] (Casey East and West), and the massive \"Science City\".  The state has a [[bus rapid transit]] line, Corridor Cities Transitway or \"CCT\", planned for the western portion of the city starting at Shady Grove Metro Station and connecting all the high density western Gaithersburg neighborhoods with a total of eight stops planned in the city.

The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) is headquartered in Gaithersburg directly west of I-270.{{refn|Although NIST's mailing address states Gaithersburg, and the City of Gaithersburg surrounds NIST's property, the land where NIST is situated is not incorporated into the City of Gaithersburg. Instead, it is in an unincorporated part of Montgomery County. Owing to the manner in which land has been added to Gaithersburg over the years, there are multiple such unincorporated [[Enclave and exclave|enclaves]] within the perimeter; see the [https://web.archive.org/web/20050516070202/http://www.gaithersburgmd.gov:80/documents/zoning_3_2005.pdf City's Zoning Map] for details (3MB PDF).|group=N}} Other major employers in the city include [[IBM]], [[Lockheed Martin]] Information Systems and Global Services business area headquarters, [[AstraZeneca]], and the French [[multinational corporation]], [[Sodexo]].  Gaithersburg is also the location of the garrison of the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Reserve]]'s [[220th Military Police Brigade (United States)|220th Military Police Brigade]].

Gaithersburg is noted for its ethnic and economic diversity; [[WalletHub]] in 2016 ranked it first among the 313 largest U.S. cities for ethnic diversity and second for social class diversity.<ref>Richie Bernardo, [https://wallethub.com/edu/most-diverse-cities/12690/ 2016’s Most Diverse Cities in America], [[WalletHub]] (May 11, 2016) (viewed Sept. 12, 2016).</ref>

Gaithersburg was settled in 1765 as a small [[agricultural]] settlement known as Log Town near the present day Summit Hall on Ralph Crabb's 1725 land grant \"Deer Park\".<ref name=fairs>{{unbulleted list|{{cite news |title=Md. Offers Two Fairs for Sunday |last=Eddy |first=Kristin |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 17, 1987 |page=M09}}|{{cite news |title=Md.

This 1,000 acre tract became part of the landmark IBM Headquarters complex built on the then-new I-270 Interstate \"Industrial\", now \"Technology\", Corridor in the late 1960s to the 1970s. [[Benjamin Gaither]] married Henry's daughter Margaret, and Benjamin and Margaret inherited a portion of Henry's land prior to Henry's death in 1807. Gaither built his home on the land in 1802.<ref>{{cite news |title=20,000 Expected to Wish Gaithersburg Happy Birthday |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 4, 1950 |page=3 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/152229303.html}}{{closed access}}</ref> By the 1850s the area had ceased to be called Log Town and was known to inhabitants as Gaithersburg.<ref name=\"Offutt\">{{cite book |last=Offutt |first=William |author2=Sween, Jane |title=Montgomery County: Centuries of Change |publisher=American Historical Press |year=1999 |pages=166–167}}</ref>

===1850s===
The Forest Oak Post Office, named for a large tree in the town, was located in Gaither's store in 1851. However, when the railroad was built through town the new station was called Gaithersburg, an officially recognized name for the community for the first time.

===1870s===
The town incorporated under its current name in 1878. Gaithersburg boomed during the late 19th century and churches, schools, a mill, [[grain elevator]]s, stores, and hotels were built. Much of this development focused around the railroad station.<ref name=Offutt/>

In 1873 the [[B&O Railroad]] constructed a station at Gaithersburg,<ref name=fairs/> designed by [[Ephraim Francis Baldwin]] as part of his well-known series of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] stations in Maryland.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gaithersburg Station |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 17, 1985 |page=MDA4 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138469281.html |location=Washington, D.C.}}{{closed access}}</ref> Rapid growth occurred shortly thereafter, and on April 5, 1878 the town was officially incorporated as the Town of Gaithersburg.

===1890s===
In 1899, Gaithersburg was selected as one of six global locations for the construction of an [[International Latitude Observatory]] as part of a project to measure the Earth's wobble on its polar axis. The [[Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory]] is (as of 2007) the only [[National Historic Landmark]] in the City of Gaithersburg. The observatory and five others in [[Japan]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], and the [[United States]] gathered information that is still used by scientists today, along with information from [[satellites]], to determine [[polar motion]]; the size, shape, and physical properties of the earth; and to aid the space program through the precise navigational patterns of orbiting satellites. The Gaithersburg station operated until 1982 when computerization rendered the manual observation obsolete.

===1960s===
In 1968, Gaithersburg was upgraded from a town to a city.

===1970s===
Gaithersburg remained a predominantly rural farm town until the 1970s when more construction began. As the population grew, with homes spreading throughout the area, Gaithersburg began taking on a suburban and semi-urban feel, leaving its farming roots behind. During the late 1990s and 2000s, it had become one of the most economically and ethnically diverse areas in the [[Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area|Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area]] as well as the [[Maryland|State of Maryland]], with people from all walks of life calling Gaithersburg home. This can be seen in the local schools, with [[Gaithersburg High School]] and [[Watkins Mill High School]] having two of the most diverse student bodies in the region.

===1990s===
During a 1997 rainstorm, the 295-year-old forest oak tree that gave its name to the Forest Oak Post Office crashed down.<ref name=goesdown>{{cite news |title=Gaithersburg Tree Goes Down in History: Storm Fells City's Famed Forest Oak |last=Vogel |first=Steve |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 28, 1997 |page=B1 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/doc/408326857.html |location=Washington, D.C. }}{{closed access}}</ref> The tree served as the inspiration for the city's logo,<ref name= goesdown/> which is also featured prominently on the city's flag.<ref name= goesdown/>

===2000s===
In 2007, parts of the film ''[[Body of Lies (film)|Body of Lies]]'' were filmed in the city, at a building on 100 Edison Park Drive. The film was released in 2008 and the building is now the [[Montgomery County Police Department]]'s headquarters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww2.gazette.net/stories/091207/potonew200048_32356.shtml|title=Spy thriller brings a touch of Hollywood to the county|date=17 March 2015|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317165446/http://ww2.gazette.net/stories/091207/potonew200048_32356.shtml|archivedate=17 March 2015}}</ref>

'''Gaithersburg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|eɪ|ð|ər|z|.|b|ər|g}} {{pronunciation|Pronunciation of \"Gaithersburg\" (city in Maryland).ogg}}), officially the '''City of Gaithersburg''', is a city in [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], [[Maryland]], United States. At the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], Gaithersburg had a population of 59,933, making it the fourth-largest incorporated city in the state, behind [[Baltimore]], [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], and [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]].<ref>[https://www.census.gov U.S. Census website], U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved June 17, 2011.</ref> Gaithersburg is located to the northwest of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and is considered a suburb and a primary city within the [[Washington metropolitan area|Washington–Arlington–Alexandria, DC–VA–MD–WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Gaithersburg was incorporated as a town in 1878 and as a city in 1968.

Gaithersburg is divided into east and west sections, separated by [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]]. The eastern section of the city is older and is the original portion of the town before more recent growth. Landmarks and buildings from that time can still be seen in many places but especially in the historic central business district of Gaithersburg called \"Olde Towne\". The east side also includes [[Lakeforest Mall]], City Hall, and the Montgomery County Fair grounds, and Bohrer Park (a well-known joint community recreation center and outdoor water park for kids and families). The west side of the city has many wealthier neighborhoods that were designed with smart growth techniques and embrace [[New Urbanism]].  These include the award-winning [[Kentlands]] community, the Lakelands community, and the Washingtonian Center (better known as Rio), a popular shopping/business district. Consumers often come to this area during Black Friday and other shopping holidays for the deals and variety of huge brand name stores like Target and Dick's Sporting Goods, and smaller stores like Francesca's and Blue Mercury.  Two New Urbanism communities are under construction, including [[Watkins Mill Town Center]] (Casey East and West), and the massive \"Science City\".  The state has a [[bus rapid transit]] line, Corridor Cities Transitway or \"CCT\", planned for the western portion of the city starting at Shady Grove Metro Station and connecting all the high density western Gaithersburg neighborhoods with a total of eight stops planned in the city.

The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) is headquartered in Gaithersburg directly west of I-270.{{refn|Although NIST's mailing address states Gaithersburg, and the City of Gaithersburg surrounds NIST's property, the land where NIST is situated is not incorporated into the City of Gaithersburg. Instead, it is in an unincorporated part of Montgomery County.

Gaithersburg was settled in 1765 as a small [[agricultural]] settlement known as Log Town near the present day Summit Hall on Ralph Crabb's 1725 land grant \"Deer Park\".<ref name=fairs>{{unbulleted list|{{cite news |title=Md. Offers Two Fairs for Sunday |last=Eddy |first=Kristin |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 17, 1987 |page=M09}}|{{cite news |title=Md.

This 1,000 acre tract became part of the landmark IBM Headquarters complex built on the then-new I-270 Interstate \"Industrial\", now \"Technology\", Corridor in the late 1960s to the 1970s. [[Benjamin Gaither]] married Henry's daughter Margaret, and Benjamin and Margaret inherited a portion of Henry's land prior to Henry's death in 1807. Gaither built his home on the land in 1802.<ref>{{cite news |title=20,000 Expected to Wish Gaithersburg Happy Birthday |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 4, 1950 |page=3 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/152229303.html}}{{closed access}}</ref> By the 1850s the area had ceased to be called Log Town and was known to inhabitants as Gaithersburg.<ref name=\"Offutt\">{{cite book |last=Offutt |first=William |author2=Sween, Jane |title=Montgomery County: Centuries of Change |publisher=American Historical Press |year=1999 |pages=166–167}}</ref>

===1850s===
The Forest Oak Post Office, named for a large tree in the town, was located in Gaither's store in 1851. However, when the railroad was built through town the new station was called Gaithersburg, an officially recognized name for the community for the first time.

===1870s===
The town incorporated under its current name in 1878. Gaithersburg boomed during the late 19th century and churches, schools, a mill, [[grain elevator]]s, stores, and hotels were built. Much of this development focused around the railroad station.<ref name=Offutt/>

In 1873 the [[B&O Railroad]] constructed a station at Gaithersburg,<ref name=fairs/> designed by [[Ephraim Francis Baldwin]] as part of his well-known series of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] stations in Maryland.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gaithersburg Station |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 17, 1985 |page=MDA4 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138469281.html |location=Washington, D.C.}}{{closed access}}</ref> Rapid growth occurred shortly thereafter, and on April 5, 1878 the town was officially incorporated as the Town of Gaithersburg.

===1890s===
In 1899, Gaithersburg was selected as one of six global locations for the construction of an [[International Latitude Observatory]] as part of a project to measure the Earth's wobble on its polar axis. The [[Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory]] is (as of 2007) the only [[National Historic Landmark]] in the City of Gaithersburg. The observatory and five others in [[Japan]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], and the [[United States]] gathered information that is still used by scientists today, along with information from [[satellites]], to determine [[polar motion]]; the size, shape, and physical properties of the earth; and to aid the space program through the precise navigational patterns of orbiting satellites. The Gaithersburg station operated until 1982 when computerization rendered the manual observation obsolete.

===1960s===
In 1968, Gaithersburg was upgraded from a town to a city.

===1970s===
Gaithersburg remained a predominantly rural farm town until the 1970s when more construction began. As the population grew, with homes spreading throughout the area, Gaithersburg began taking on a suburban and semi-urban feel, leaving its farming roots behind. During the late 1990s and 2000s, it had become one of the most economically and ethnically diverse areas in the [[Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area|Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area]] as well as the [[Maryland|State of Maryland]], with people from all walks of life calling Gaithersburg home. This can be seen in the local schools, with [[Gaithersburg High School]] and [[Watkins Mill High School]] having two of the most diverse student bodies in the region.

===1990s===
During a 1997 rainstorm, the 295-year-old forest oak tree that gave its name to the Forest Oak Post Office crashed down.<ref name=goesdown>{{cite news |title=Gaithersburg Tree Goes Down in History: Storm Fells City's Famed Forest Oak |last=Vogel |first=Steve |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 28, 1997 |page=B1 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/doc/408326857.html |location=Washington, D.C. }}{{closed access}}</ref> The tree served as the inspiration for the city's logo,<ref name= goesdown/> which is also featured prominently on the city's flag.<ref name= goesdown/>

===2000s===
In 2007, parts of the film ''[[Body of Lies (film)|Body of Lies]]'' were filmed in the city, at a building on 100 Edison Park Drive. The film was released in 2008 and the building is now the [[Montgomery County Police Department]]'s headquarters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww2.gazette.net/stories/091207/potonew200048_32356.shtml|title=Spy thriller brings a touch of Hollywood to the county|date=17 March 2015|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317165446/http://ww2.gazette.net/stories/091207/potonew200048_32356.shtml|archivedate=17 March 2015}}</ref>

'''Interstate&nbsp;90''' ('''I-90''') is a part of the [[Interstate Highway System]] that runs from [[Seattle, Washington]], to [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. In the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], I-90 extends {{convert|385.88|mi|2}} from the [[New York–Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] at [[Ripley, New York|Ripley]] to the [[Massachusetts]] state line at [[Canaan, New York|Canaan]], and is the second-longest highway in the state after [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]]. Although most of the route is part of the tolled [[New York State Thruway]], two non-tolled sections exist along I-90 (the first, situated outside of Buffalo, is included in the Thruway system; the second, situated in the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], is not part of the Thruway system and links [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and its eastern suburbs). Within New York, I-90 has a complete set of auxiliary Interstates, which means that there are interstates numbered [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] through [[Interstate 990|I-990]] in the state, with no gaps in between. For most of its length in New York, I-90 runs parallel to the former [[Erie Canal]] route, [[New York State Route&nbsp;5]] (NY&nbsp;5), [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;20]] (US&nbsp;20) and the [[CSX]] railroad mainline that traverses the state.

I-90 was assigned in 1957 as part of the establishment of the Interstate Highway System. In New York, it was overlaid on the pre-existing New York State Thruway from Pennsylvania to Albany, from where it would have continued to Massachusetts on a new freeway that bypassed the [[Berkshire Connector]] to the north. Ultimately, the freeway was built from the Thruway mainline in Albany to the Berkshire Connector in [[Schodack, New York|Schodack]], and I-90 was assigned to the segment of the Connector east of the proposed freeway. The Albany–Schodack freeway was completed in stages during the 1960s and 1970s and fully open by 1977.

== Route description ==

=== New York State Thruway ===
{{Main|New York State Thruway#Mainline|l1=New York State Thruway (mainline)}}
West of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], I-90 in New York is designated along the mainline of the [[New York State Thruway]]. The Thruway begins at the [[New York–Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], following the shore of [[Lake Erie]] northeast and passes through the town of [[Cheektowaga, New York|Cheektowaga]], a large [[suburb]] of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] directly east of the city. Two auxiliary routes, [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] (leading to [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] and connecting into Canada as [[Ontario Highway 405]]) and [[Interstate 290 (New York)|I-290]] (a northerly bypass of Buffalo) connect with I-90 here. Both auxiliary routes provide access between I-90 and Canada's largest city, [[Toronto]]. East of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], the Thruway turns east and passes through the suburbs of several major cities in [[Upstate New York]], generally following the path of the [[Erie Canal]]. It passes south of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and north of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], which are served by three auxiliary Interstate Highways: [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]] and [[Interstate 390|I-390]] connect to Rochester, while [[Interstate 690|I-690]] leads to Syracuse.<ref name=\"2009map\">{{cite map |title=New York State Map |publisher=[[I Love New York]] |year=2009 |cartography=[[Map Works]]}}</ref>  The speed limit, enforced by the [[New York State Police]], is 65 miles per hour along most of this stretch.<ref name=\"speedlimit\">{{cite web|title=History of NY Thruway 1991–2000|url=http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history6.shtml|accessdate=June 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815074637/http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history6.shtml|archive-date=August 15, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:I-90 west in West Seneca NY.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching exit&nbsp;54 on I-90 westbound in West Seneca]]
East of Syracuse, the Thruway follows the Erie Canal and, later, the [[Mohawk River]] into the [[Mohawk Valley]] toward [[Utica, New York|Utica]], where I-90 skirts the northern edge of downtown and meets [[Interstate 790|I-790]], a short route leading into the city's center. Farther east, the freeway indirectly serves the canal and riverside cities of [[Little Falls (city), New York|Little Falls]] (via [[New York State Route 169|NY&nbsp;169]]) and [[Amsterdam (city), New York|Amsterdam]] ([[New York State Route 30|NY&nbsp;30]]) on its way to [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], where [[Interstate 890|I-890]] splits from the Thruway and serves as the connection to the city center. It rejoins I-90 in [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]], where I-90 leaves the mainline of the Thruway at exit&nbsp;24 in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], which is signed for I-87 north and I-90 east. Here, the route designation of the Thruway changes from I-90 east to I-87 south. Traffic intending to continue on I-90 or reach I-87 north must exit the Thruway here. Exit numbers and mile markers for I-90 reset after exiting.<ref name=\"2009map\" />

=== Albany and Rensselaer counties ===
[[File:Guilderland Service Area, New York.jpg|thumb|left|Guilderland Service Area]]
The Albany–[[Schodack, New York|Schodack]] section of I-90—the only portion of I-90 in New York that is not part of the Thruway system—begins concurrent with I-87 and heads southeast from Thruway exit&nbsp;24 to a toll barrier that, for now, marks the end of tolls along the freeway. Now a toll-free highway, I-90 and I-87 continue to exits&nbsp;1N and&nbsp;1S, which are for the [[Adirondack Northway]] (I-87) and Fuller Road Alternate (unsigned [[New York State Route 910F|NY&nbsp;910F]]), respectively. Located off exit&nbsp;1S and Fuller Road Alternate, a spur of the Northway leading to Western Avenue ([[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]]), is the [[Crossgates Mall]] in [[Guilderland, New York|Guilderland]]. I-90 proceeds eastward, meeting Washington Avenue at an interchange connecting to [[University at Albany, SUNY|UAlbany]], a state university, eastbound and Fuller Road ([[County Route 156 (Albany County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;156]] or CR&nbsp;156) westbound.<ref name=\"yahoo\">{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=42.59352&lon=-73.764625&zoom=12&q1=42.707209%2C-73.858937&q2=42.481194%2C-73.672427 |title=overview map of I-90 from Albany to Berkshire Thruway |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref>

Exits&nbsp;3 and&nbsp;4, located {{convert|0.6|mi|1}} apart in an area bounded by Washington and Central ([[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]]) avenues, lead to the [[W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus]] and the New York State Police Academy (exit&nbsp;3) and to the Crosstown Arterial ([[New York State Route 85|NY&nbsp;85]] at exit&nbsp;4). I-90 subsequently crosses over NY&nbsp;5 and passes north of [[Westgate Plaza (Albany, New York)|Westgate Plaza]] as it connects to Everett Road ([[County Route 155 (Albany County, New York)|CR&nbsp;155]]). The freeway continues along the northern edge of Albany to exit&nbsp;5A,<ref name=\"yahoo\" /> a large [[trumpet interchange]] originally built to serve [[Interstate 687|I-687]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/regional-offices/region1/projects/i87exit3/history |title=History |work=Adirondack Northway Exit 3 Project |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |accessdate=June 11, 2010}}</ref> After that project was cancelled, it was repurposed as an exit for Corporate Woods Boulevard. East of exit&nbsp;5A, I-90 passes by slightly more residential areas ahead of a [[stack interchange]] with [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] {{convert|1|mi|1}} north of downtown Albany. Albany Memorial Hospital is located just north of the exit on US&nbsp;9.<ref name=\"yahoo\" />

[[File:I-90 east at US 9 in Albany NY.jpg|thumb|The stack interchange between I-90 and US&nbsp;9 in Albany as seen from I-90 eastbound]]
Not far to the east of US&nbsp;9 is a second stack interchange, connecting I-90 to [[Interstate 787|I-787]] in the industrial northeasternmost section of the city of Albany. At this point, I-90 turns to the southeast and follows the [[Patroon Island Bridge]] over the [[Hudson River]] and into [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer County]]. Across the river, I-90 becomes the Rensselaer County Veterans Memorial Highway and passes through much less developed areas. In its first {{convert|1.5|mi|1}} in the county, the freeway meets Washington Avenue at the northern edge of the city of [[Rensselaer, New York|Rensselaer]] and the west end of [[New York State Route 43|NY&nbsp;43]] in the town of [[North Greenbush, New York|North Greenbush]], southwest of [[U.S. Route 4 in New York|US&nbsp;4]] and [[Defreestville, New York|Defreestville]]. South of NY&nbsp;43, I-90 and US&nbsp;4 follow parallel routings into [[East Greenbush, New York|East Greenbush]], where I-90 directly connects to US&nbsp;4 at exit&nbsp;9.<ref name=\"yahoo\" />

I-90 heads southeastward across an undeveloped, forested section of the county, crossing over [[New York State Route 151|NY&nbsp;151]] and entering the town of Schodack, where it meets Miller Road, a connector between I-90 and the concurrent routes of US&nbsp;9 and [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]]. The freeway and the overlapping U.S. Routes follow similar routings to [[Schodack Center, New York|Schodack Center]], at which point I-90 finally connects to US&nbsp;9 and US&nbsp;20 at exits&nbsp;11E and&nbsp;11W. I-90 heads due south from this point, passing over [[New York State Route 150|NY&nbsp;150]] and paralleling US&nbsp;9, which splits from US&nbsp;20 at Schodack Center. The routes cross paths again at exit&nbsp;12 just north of where I-90 rejoins the Thruway system at a toll barrier preceding exit&nbsp;B1 of the [[Berkshire Connector]].<ref name=\"yahoo\" />

=== Berkshire Connector ===
{{Main|New York State Thruway#Berkshire Connector|l1=New York State Thruway (Berkshire Connector)}}
I-90 heads southeast on the Connector, meeting the north end of the [[Taconic State Parkway]] in the [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]] town of [[Chatham (town), New York|Chatham]] at exit&nbsp;B2 and [[New York State Route 22|NY&nbsp;22]] at exit&nbsp;B3 in the town of [[Canaan, New York|Canaan]] {{convert|1|mi|1}} from the [[Massachusetts]] state line. The Berkshire Connector ends at the state line; however, I-90 continues southeast into Massachusetts as the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]].<ref name=\"2009map\" />

[[File:I-90 in Chatham NY.jpg|thumb|left|The Berkshire Connector (I-90) near exit&nbsp;B2 in Chatham]]
The east–west corridor I-90 follows across New York has always been major, followed by the [[Genesee Trail]] (1790s), [[Erie Canal]] (1825), [[New York Central Railroad]] (1853), and later the [[Yellowstone Trail]] (1912), which became [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]] and [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]]. It was planned as part of a nationwide [[toll road]] system as early as 1938.<ref>{{cite map |publisher=[[Bureau of Public Roads]] |title=[[:File:US toll roads 1938.jpg|Location of Routes Selected for Study]] |year=1938}}</ref> Exactly which cities would be served changed over the years, but it was the state of New York that made the decision in 1942, when they passed a law for the construction of a [[New York City]]–[[Albany, New York|Albany]]–[[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]–[[Pennsylvania]] \"thruway\".

Construction then progressed much more rapidly, especially after 1954, when the authority was allowed to issue [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] not backed by the state (thus having higher [[interest rate]]s).<ref>{{cite book |last=Kaszynski |first=William |title=The American Highway: The History and Culture of Roads in the United States |year=2000 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=0-7864-0822-7 |pages=141–142}}</ref> The roadway was completed between Buffalo and Albany in 1954,<ref>{{cite news |title=More of Thruway Opened by Dewey |last=Weaver |first=Warren Jr. |date=October 27, 1954 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=31}}</ref> to New York City in 1956,<ref>{{cite news |title=Thruway Opening Final Link Friday |last=Ingraham |first=Joseph C. |date=August 27, 1956 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=21}}</ref> to Pennsylvania in 1957,<ref>{{cite news |title=The Thruway Becomes the Longest Toll Road |date=December 15, 1957 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=159}}</ref> and to Massachusetts in 1959.<ref>{{cite news |title=Boston to Chicago |last=Ingraham |first=Joseph C. |date=May 24, 1959 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=XX1 }}</ref>

In the meantime, the [[National Interstate and Defense Highways Act]] was enacted in 1956, promising a toll-free network of [[Interstate Highway]]s throughout the nation. The [[Bureau of Public Roads]] (BPR) commissioner soon announced that the toll road met all federal [[Interstate Highway standards]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Thruway Called a Model Project |last=Pierce |first=Bret |date=September 19, 1956 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=39}}</ref> and on August&nbsp;14, 1957, most of the mainline of the Thruway was incorporated into the system as part of Interstates&nbsp;[[Interstate 87 (New York)|87]] and&nbsp;90. Most of the connecting [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] was also included, but a more northerly alignment, avoiding the Berkshire Thruway, was proposed by the states of New York and Massachusetts for I-90 through Albany past [[Pittsfield, MA|Pittsfield]] to [[East Lee, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"1957map\">{{cite map |publisher=[[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |title=[[:File:Interstate Highway plan August 14, 1957.jpg|Official route numbering for the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways]] |date=August 14, 1957}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|year=1957|journal=[[Traffic Engineering (magazine)|Traffic Engineering]]|publisher=[[Institute of Traffic Engineers]]|volume=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?num=100&id=McE7AAAAMAAJ&dq=%22boston+to+east+lee&q=%22boston+to+east+lee&pgis=1#search|title=Traffic Engineering for I90}}</ref> This alignment would be about 30% shorter than the all-toll alignment, and would provide relief to the four-lane [[Castleton Bridge]] on the Berkshire Thruway, which had been built narrower than the rest of the system because of the planned parallel alternate.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?num=100&id=SB8TAAAAIAAJ&dq=relocated+route+20+albany&q=%22The+structure+for+the+toll+route+is+the+only&pgis=1#search Highway Cost Estimates: Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Public Works], 1958, p. 173</ref><!--this needs more about the piece west of I-787, which is on the 1955 plan--> The BPR objected to the duplication, which would cost over $90 million, and refused to approve this alignment.<ref>[[U.S. Congress]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=H70uAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22bureau+of+public+roads%22+interstate+toll+berkshire&q=berkshire&pgis=1#search Miscellaneous Highway Legislation], 1961, p. 112</ref> The eventual route ran southeast from Albany to the Berkshire Thruway at the [[Nassau (village), New York|Nassau]] interchange, providing Albany with an alternate route and additional bridge, but not offering any savings in distance, and creating a \"toll trap\" for drivers accessing the [[Taconic State Parkway]] from Albany.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rockefeller Urged to Veto Road Link |date=March 30, 1964 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=25}}</ref>

In 1999, the [[New York State Department of Transportation]], the [[Federal Highway Administration]] and NYSTA discussed redesignating the [[Berkshire Connector]] as I-90 and redesignating the non-toll part of I-90 from Thruway exit&nbsp;24 to exit&nbsp;B1 on the Connector as [[Interstate 88 (east)|I-88]]. The section of the Thruway between exits&nbsp;25 and&nbsp;24 would then be [[concurrency (road)|co-designated]] as both I-90 and I-88.

'''Interstate&nbsp;90''' ('''I-90''') is a part of the [[Interstate Highway System]] that runs from [[Seattle, Washington]], to [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. In the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], I-90 extends {{convert|385.88|mi|2}} from the [[New York–Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] at [[Ripley, New York|Ripley]] to the [[Massachusetts]] state line at [[Canaan, New York|Canaan]], and is the second-longest highway in the state after [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]]. Although most of the route is part of the tolled [[New York State Thruway]], two non-tolled sections exist along I-90 (the first, situated outside of Buffalo, is included in the Thruway system; the second, situated in the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], is not part of the Thruway system and links [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and its eastern suburbs). Within New York, I-90 has a complete set of auxiliary Interstates, which means that there are interstates numbered [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] through [[Interstate 990|I-990]] in the state, with no gaps in between. For most of its length in New York, I-90 runs parallel to the former [[Erie Canal]] route, [[New York State Route&nbsp;5]] (NY&nbsp;5), [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;20]] (US&nbsp;20) and the [[CSX]] railroad mainline that traverses the state.

I-90 was assigned in 1957 as part of the establishment of the Interstate Highway System. In New York, it was overlaid on the pre-existing New York State Thruway from Pennsylvania to Albany, from where it would have continued to Massachusetts on a new freeway that bypassed the [[Berkshire Connector]] to the north. Ultimately, the freeway was built from the Thruway mainline in Albany to the Berkshire Connector in [[Schodack, New York|Schodack]], and I-90 was assigned to the segment of the Connector east of the proposed freeway. The Albany–Schodack freeway was completed in stages during the 1960s and 1970s and fully open by 1977.

== Route description ==

=== New York State Thruway ===
{{Main|New York State Thruway#Mainline|l1=New York State Thruway (mainline)}}
West of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], I-90 in New York is designated along the mainline of the [[New York State Thruway]]. The Thruway begins at the [[New York–Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], following the shore of [[Lake Erie]] northeast and passes through the town of [[Cheektowaga, New York|Cheektowaga]], a large [[suburb]] of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] directly east of the city. Two auxiliary routes, [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] (leading to [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] and connecting into Canada as [[Ontario Highway 405]]) and [[Interstate 290 (New York)|I-290]] (a northerly bypass of Buffalo) connect with I-90 here. Both auxiliary routes provide access between I-90 and Canada's largest city, [[Toronto]]. East of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], the Thruway turns east and passes through the suburbs of several major cities in [[Upstate New York]], generally following the path of the [[Erie Canal]].

East of Syracuse, the Thruway follows the Erie Canal and, later, the [[Mohawk River]] into the [[Mohawk Valley]] toward [[Utica, New York|Utica]], where I-90 skirts the northern edge of downtown and meets [[Interstate 790|I-790]], a short route leading into the city's center. Farther east, the freeway indirectly serves the canal and riverside cities of [[Little Falls (city), New York|Little Falls]] (via [[New York State Route 169|NY&nbsp;169]]) and [[Amsterdam (city), New York|Amsterdam]] ([[New York State Route 30|NY&nbsp;30]]) on its way to [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], where [[Interstate 890|I-890]] splits from the Thruway and serves as the connection to the city center. It rejoins I-90 in [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]], where I-90 leaves the mainline of the Thruway at exit&nbsp;24 in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], which is signed for I-87 north and I-90 east. Here, the route designation of the Thruway changes from I-90 east to I-87 south. Traffic intending to continue on I-90 or reach I-87 north must exit the Thruway here. Exit numbers and mile markers for I-90 reset after exiting.<ref name=\"2009map\" />

[[File:Guilderland Service Area, New York.jpg|thumb|left|Guilderland Service Area]]
The Albany–[[Schodack, New York|Schodack]] section of I-90—the only portion of I-90 in New York that is not part of the Thruway system—begins concurrent with I-87 and heads southeast from Thruway exit&nbsp;24 to a toll barrier that, for now, marks the end of tolls along the freeway. Now a toll-free highway, I-90 and I-87 continue to exits&nbsp;1N and&nbsp;1S, which are for the [[Adirondack Northway]] (I-87) and Fuller Road Alternate (unsigned [[New York State Route 910F|NY&nbsp;910F]]), respectively. Located off exit&nbsp;1S and Fuller Road Alternate, a spur of the Northway leading to Western Avenue ([[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]]), is the [[Crossgates Mall]] in [[Guilderland, New York|Guilderland]]. I-90 proceeds eastward, meeting Washington Avenue at an interchange connecting to [[University at Albany, SUNY|UAlbany]], a state university, eastbound and Fuller Road ([[County Route 156 (Albany County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;156]] or CR&nbsp;156) westbound.<ref name=\"yahoo\">{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=42.59352&lon=-73.764625&zoom=12&q1=42.707209%2C-73.858937&q2=42.481194%2C-73.672427 |title=overview map of I-90 from Albany to Berkshire Thruway |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref>

Exits&nbsp;3 and&nbsp;4, located {{convert|0.6|mi|1}} apart in an area bounded by Washington and Central ([[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]]) avenues, lead to the [[W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus]] and the New York State Police Academy (exit&nbsp;3) and to the Crosstown Arterial ([[New York State Route 85|NY&nbsp;85]] at exit&nbsp;4). I-90 subsequently crosses over NY&nbsp;5 and passes north of [[Westgate Plaza (Albany, New York)|Westgate Plaza]] as it connects to Everett Road ([[County Route 155 (Albany County, New York)|CR&nbsp;155]]). The freeway continues along the northern edge of Albany to exit&nbsp;5A,<ref name=\"yahoo\" /> a large [[trumpet interchange]] originally built to serve [[Interstate 687|I-687]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/regional-offices/region1/projects/i87exit3/history |title=History |work=Adirondack Northway Exit 3 Project |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |accessdate=June 11, 2010}}</ref> After that project was cancelled, it was repurposed as an exit for Corporate Woods Boulevard. East of exit&nbsp;5A, I-90 passes by slightly more residential areas ahead of a [[stack interchange]] with [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] {{convert|1|mi|1}} north of downtown Albany. Albany Memorial Hospital is located just north of the exit on US&nbsp;9.<ref name=\"yahoo\" />

[[File:I-90 east at US 9 in Albany NY.jpg|thumb|The stack interchange between I-90 and US&nbsp;9 in Albany as seen from I-90 eastbound]]
Not far to the east of US&nbsp;9 is a second stack interchange, connecting I-90 to [[Interstate 787|I-787]] in the industrial northeasternmost section of the city of Albany. At this point, I-90 turns to the southeast and follows the [[Patroon Island Bridge]] over the [[Hudson River]] and into [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer County]]. Across the river, I-90 becomes the Rensselaer County Veterans Memorial Highway and passes through much less developed areas. In its first {{convert|1.5|mi|1}} in the county, the freeway meets Washington Avenue at the northern edge of the city of [[Rensselaer, New York|Rensselaer]] and the west end of [[New York State Route 43|NY&nbsp;43]] in the town of [[North Greenbush, New York|North Greenbush]], southwest of [[U.S. Route 4 in New York|US&nbsp;4]] and [[Defreestville, New York|Defreestville]]. South of NY&nbsp;43, I-90 and US&nbsp;4 follow parallel routings into [[East Greenbush, New York|East Greenbush]], where I-90 directly connects to US&nbsp;4 at exit&nbsp;9.<ref name=\"yahoo\" />

I-90 heads southeastward across an undeveloped, forested section of the county, crossing over [[New York State Route 151|NY&nbsp;151]] and entering the town of Schodack, where it meets Miller Road, a connector between I-90 and the concurrent routes of US&nbsp;9 and [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]]. The freeway and the overlapping U.S. Routes follow similar routings to [[Schodack Center, New York|Schodack Center]], at which point I-90 finally connects to US&nbsp;9 and US&nbsp;20 at exits&nbsp;11E and&nbsp;11W. I-90 heads due south from this point, passing over [[New York State Route 150|NY&nbsp;150]] and paralleling US&nbsp;9, which splits from US&nbsp;20 at Schodack Center. The routes cross paths again at exit&nbsp;12 just north of where I-90 rejoins the Thruway system at a toll barrier preceding exit&nbsp;B1 of the [[Berkshire Connector]].<ref name=\"yahoo\" />

=== Berkshire Connector ===
{{Main|New York State Thruway#Berkshire Connector|l1=New York State Thruway (Berkshire Connector)}}
I-90 heads southeast on the Connector, meeting the north end of the [[Taconic State Parkway]] in the [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]] town of [[Chatham (town), New York|Chatham]] at exit&nbsp;B2 and [[New York State Route 22|NY&nbsp;22]] at exit&nbsp;B3 in the town of [[Canaan, New York|Canaan]] {{convert|1|mi|1}} from the [[Massachusetts]] state line. The Berkshire Connector ends at the state line; however, I-90 continues southeast into Massachusetts as the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]].<ref name=\"2009map\" />

The east–west corridor I-90 follows across New York has always been major, followed by the [[Genesee Trail]] (1790s), [[Erie Canal]] (1825), [[New York Central Railroad]] (1853), and later the [[Yellowstone Trail]] (1912), which became [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]] and [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]]. It was planned as part of a nationwide [[toll road]] system as early as 1938.<ref>{{cite map |publisher=[[Bureau of Public Roads]] |title=[[:File:US toll roads 1938.jpg|Location of Routes Selected for Study]] |year=1938}}</ref> Exactly which cities would be served changed over the years, but it was the state of New York that made the decision in 1942, when they passed a law for the construction of a [[New York City]]–[[Albany, New York|Albany]]–[[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]–[[Pennsylvania]] \"thruway\". This highway, passing [[Utica, New York|Utica]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] on its path between Albany and Buffalo, would provide construction jobs in the [[post-World War II]] period.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=sxNLAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Statement+by+Assemblyman+Moffat+and+Senator+Hampton+Relative+to+the+Establishment+of+a+State+Thruway+System%2C+March+13%2C+1942&pgis=1#search Statement by Assemblyman Moffat and Senator Hampton Relative to the Establishment of a State Thruway System, March 13, 1942], New York Legislative Document, 1942, v. 15 no. 80–82, p. 153<!--this citation could use better details--></ref> The [[Berkshire Thruway]], a branch east from near Albany to [[Massachusetts]], was authorized in 1944, completing the east–west route across the state.<ref name=\"thru-hist4\">{{cite book |title=Thruway Chronology |url=http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history1.shtml |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |year=2002 |publisher=[[New York State Thruway Authority]] |chapter=The New York State Thruway: The Beginning |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029162804/http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history1.shtml |archive-date=October 29, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, construction, which began in 1946, proceeded very slowly, with only one four-mile (6&nbsp;km) portion open by 1950, when a law created the [[New York State Thruway Authority]] (NYSTA) to operate the route as a [[toll road]]. Construction then progressed much more rapidly, especially after 1954, when the authority was allowed to issue [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] not backed by the state (thus having higher [[interest rate]]s).<ref>{{cite book |last=Kaszynski |first=William |title=The American Highway: The History and Culture of Roads in the United States |year=2000 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=0-7864-0822-7 |pages=141–142}}</ref> The roadway was completed between Buffalo and Albany in 1954,<ref>{{cite news |title=More of Thruway Opened by Dewey |last=Weaver |first=Warren Jr. |date=October 27, 1954 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=31}}</ref> to New York City in 1956,<ref>{{cite news |title=Thruway Opening Final Link Friday |last=Ingraham |first=Joseph C. |date=August 27, 1956 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=21}}</ref> to Pennsylvania in 1957,<ref>{{cite news |title=The Thruway Becomes the Longest Toll Road |date=December 15, 1957 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=159}}</ref> and to Massachusetts in 1959.<ref>{{cite news |title=Boston to Chicago |last=Ingraham |first=Joseph C. |date=May 24, 1959 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=XX1 }}</ref>

In the meantime, the [[National Interstate and Defense Highways Act]] was enacted in 1956, promising a toll-free network of [[Interstate Highway]]s throughout the nation. The [[Bureau of Public Roads]] (BPR) commissioner soon announced that the toll road met all federal [[Interstate Highway standards]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Thruway Called a Model Project |last=Pierce |first=Bret |date=September 19, 1956 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=39}}</ref> and on August&nbsp;14, 1957, most of the mainline of the Thruway was incorporated into the system as part of Interstates&nbsp;[[Interstate 87 (New York)|87]] and&nbsp;90. Most of the connecting [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] was also included, but a more northerly alignment, avoiding the Berkshire Thruway, was proposed by the states of New York and Massachusetts for I-90 through Albany past [[Pittsfield, MA|Pittsfield]] to [[East Lee, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"1957map\">{{cite map |publisher=[[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |title=[[:File:Interstate Highway plan August 14, 1957.jpg|Official route numbering for the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways]] |date=August 14, 1957}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|year=1957|journal=[[Traffic Engineering (magazine)|Traffic Engineering]]|publisher=[[Institute of Traffic Engineers]]|volume=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?num=100&id=McE7AAAAMAAJ&dq=%22boston+to+east+lee&q=%22boston+to+east+lee&pgis=1#search|title=Traffic Engineering for I90}}</ref> This alignment would be about 30% shorter than the all-toll alignment, and would provide relief to the four-lane [[Castleton Bridge]] on the Berkshire Thruway, which had been built narrower than the rest of the system because of the planned parallel alternate.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?num=100&id=SB8TAAAAIAAJ&dq=relocated+route+20+albany&q=%22The+structure+for+the+toll+route+is+the+only&pgis=1#search Highway Cost Estimates: Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Public Works], 1958, p. 173</ref><!--this needs more about the piece west of I-787, which is on the 1955 plan--> The BPR objected to the duplication, which would cost over $90 million, and refused to approve this alignment.<ref>[[U.S. Congress]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=H70uAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22bureau+of+public+roads%22+interstate+toll+berkshire&q=berkshire&pgis=1#search Miscellaneous Highway Legislation], 1961, p. 112</ref> The eventual route ran southeast from Albany to the Berkshire Thruway at the [[Nassau (village), New York|Nassau]] interchange, providing Albany with an alternate route and additional bridge, but not offering any savings in distance, and creating a \"toll trap\" for drivers accessing the [[Taconic State Parkway]] from Albany.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rockefeller Urged to Veto Road Link |date=March 30, 1964 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=25}}</ref>

Construction on the route of I-90 through Albany began {{circa|1963}}, with both ends at existing Thruway interchanges: exit&nbsp;24, which crossed the [[Adirondack Northway]] (I-87) at a [[cloverleaf interchange]] and connected to Washington Avenue in western Albany, and exit&nbsp;B1, which connected to [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] near Nassau.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York with Sight-Seeing Guide |publisher=[[Esso]] |cartography=[[General Drafting]] |year=1962 |edition=1962}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York Happy Motoring Guide |publisher=Esso |cartography=General Drafting |year=1963 |edition=1963}}</ref> Work on the freeway began at the Northway and progressed southeasterly to the Berkshire Connector in Rensselaer County.

In 1999, the [[New York State Department of Transportation]], the [[Federal Highway Administration]] and NYSTA discussed redesignating the [[Berkshire Connector]] as I-90 and redesignating the non-toll part of I-90 from Thruway exit&nbsp;24 to exit&nbsp;B1 on the Connector as [[Interstate 88 (east)|I-88]]. The section of the Thruway between exits&nbsp;25 and&nbsp;24 would then be [[concurrency (road)|co-designated]] as both I-90 and I-88.

The '''Islamic State in Somalia''' (short: '''ISS''') or '''Abnaa ul-Calipha''' is an [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]-affiliated group that primarily operates in the mountainous areas of [[Puntland]], though has also claimed responsibility for several terrorist attacks throughout the rest of [[Somalia]]. Led by Sheikh [[Abdul Qadir Mumin]], the group is estimated to have up to 300 active fighters. Since its formation, ISS probably managed to take control of a small, sparsely populated territory in northern Somalia's mountainous hinterland, though it was not acknowledged as [[ISIL territorial claims|official province]] (\"Wilayat\") by ISIL's central leadership until December 2017. Since then, it has sometimes been called '''Somalia Province''' (\"Wilayat al Somal\") by pro-ISIL media. ISS is also the declared enemy of [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], which considers the Islamic State a significant threat to its own predominance among Jihadist factions in Somalia.

== History ==
=== Origins and formation ===
[[File:LocationPuntland3.png|thumb|left|Location of [[Puntland]] (blue) in [[Somalia]] ]]

The origins of the Islamic State in Somalia trace back to 2012, when [[Abdul Qadir Mumin]] was sent by the al-Shabaab leadership to its remote outpost in Puntland, far from the insurgent group's primary areas of operation in southern Somalia. As cleric with little military experience, Mumin's role in Puntland was originally to attract recruits for the numerical small and militarily weak local al-Shabaab group, which was led by [[Mohamed Said Atom]] at the time. In course of the [[Galgala campaign]] in 2014, however, Atom defected to the government, and Mumin was forced to take control of the Puntland group. Isolated in the remote north and feeling increasingly distanced from al-Shabaab, Mumin began to consider himself more and more independent.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}}

Meanwhile, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant had launched a propaganda campaign to convince al-Shabaab to join to them, which was \"angrily refused\" by al-Shabaab's central leadership.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}} Despite this, several groups of al-Shabaab members found ISIL's ideology attractive or saw this new Jihadist organization as a way to challenge al-Shabaab's leadership at the time. Thus, several small pro-ISIL groups emerged in southern Somalia. This was however not tolerated by the Somali organization, which released statements condemning dissenters{{efn|name=fn1|Al-Shabaab radio stations for example declared in November 2015: \"If anyone says he belongs to another Islamic movement [other than that of al-Qa'ida], kill him on the spot ... we will cut the throat of anyone ... if they undermine unity.\" Al-Shabaab spokesman Ali Mahmud Rage similarly claimed that dissenters in the organization were \"infidels\" who would be \"burnt in hell\".{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=28}} }} and ordered its internal security service Amniyat to arrest or kill pro-ISIL elements such as Hussein Abdi Gedi's faction in [[Middle Juba]].{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=29}}

Mumin, however, long dissatisfied with his situation, pledged ''[[bay'ah]]'' to [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]] and the Islamic State in October 2015. This caused a violent split within Puntland's al-Shabaab, as only 20 of the 300 local Islamist fighters joined Mumin,{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}}<ref name=\"port town\">{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/10/islamic-state-in-somalia-claims-capture-of-port-town.php|title=Islamic State in Somalia claims capture of port town|author=Caleb Weiss|publisher=[[Long War Journal]]|date=26 October 2016|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref> while the al-Shabaab loyalists attempted to kill these defectors. Mumin's small group proceeded to form ''Abnaa ul-Calipha'', better known as ''Islamic State in Somalia'', and to evade their erstwhile comrades, while recruiting new members for their cause.<ref name=\"vow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/somali-officials-vow-to-retake-puntland-town/3570974.html|title=Somali Officials Vow to Retake Puntland Town|author=Harun Maruf|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|date=28 October 2016|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref> Al-Baghdadi and the ISIL leadership did not acknowledge Mumin's bay'ah, instead choosing to wait and see how the Islamic State in Somalia fared.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}} While Mumin's group in the north thus managed to survive, the situation of pro-ISIL forces in southern Somalia consequently became even more precarious. In two notable incidents in November and December 2015, al-Shabaab attacked and destroyed two of the most important southern ISIL cells, namely the ones of Bashir Abu Numan and Mohammad Makkawi Ibrahim. Pro-government forces such as the [[Somali Armed Forces]] and [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]] also claimed to have targeted southern ISIL groups. As result, ISIL forces in southern Somialia remained very weak,{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|pp=28, 29}} and those that survived appear to have accepted Mumin's authority over time, formally becoming part of ISS.{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|pp=27, 28}} As result, the \"disparate clump of pro-Islamic State cells\" in Somalia transformed into an \"organized group\".{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=29}}

=== Rise in power and Qandala campaign ===

In March 2016, an ISS cell in southern Puntland was pursued by al-Shabaab fighters into [[Mudug]]; the pursuers were however attacked and completely defeated by the [[Puntland Dervish Force]] and [[Military of Galmudug|Galmudug soldiers]], thus unintentionally allowing the Islamic State militants to escape into safety.<ref name=\"puntland state\">{{cite web|url=https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/horn-africa/somalia/islamic-state-threat-somalias-puntland-state|title=The Islamic State Threat in Somalia’s Puntland State |author1=Zakaria Yusuf |author2=Abdul Khalif |work=[[International Crisis Group]] |date=17 November 2016|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref> From this point onwards, ISS and al-Shabaab temporarily ceased fighting each other with the exception of some isolated incidents.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} Over the following months Mumin's followers built up their strength, and by April 2016 they had set up a temporary training camp named after Bashir Abu Numan, the ISIL follower mentioned above who had been killed by al-Shabaab in November 2015.<ref name=\"camp\" />{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=29}} In one of the group's propaganda videos, Mumin blessed the makeshift base as the \"first camp of the Caliphate in Somalia\". On 25 April, ISS also carried out its first attack on government forces, when one of its fighters detonated an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] against an [[African Union Mission to Somalia|AMISOM]] vehicle in [[Mogadishu]].<ref name=\"camp\" /> By August 2016, Mumin's cell still remained very small, probably under 100 militants, and was not yet very active. According to the [[United States Department of State]], however, ISS began to expand in size by abducting and indoctrinating boys between 10 and 15 and employing them as [[Military use of children|child soldiers]].<ref name=\"list global\">{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/08/us-adds-islamic-state-commander-in-somalia-to-list-of-global-terrorists.php|title=US adds Islamic State commander in Somalia to list of global terrorists|author=Bill Roggio|publisher=[[Long War Journal]]|date=31 August 2016|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>

By October 2016, ISS had claimed less than one dozen attacks overall since its foundation, showing that the group was still relatively weak. Nevertheless, the fact that many of these strikes had taken place in Mogadishu, indicated that ISS had become able to operate throughout wider Somalia, not just in its core regions in Puntland.<ref name=\"port town\" /> Experts also estimated that Mumin's cell had significantly grown to up to 300 fighters. On 26 October, the group eventually launched their first major operation by [[Qandala campaign|targeting]] the major port town of [[Qandala]].

[[File:Bosasintvilhot.jpg|thumb|left|ISS launched an unsuccessful attack on the Village Hotel in [[Bosaso]] in February 2017 ]]

The Qandala campaign resulted in the Puntland government as well as the [[African Union]] taking ISS more seriously, with both taking more steps to counter ISS' growing strength.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}} In addition, ISS began to cooperate with al-Shabaab to a limited degree during the subsequent months.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=33}} On 8 February 2017, ISS launched its next major attack in Puntland, with several militants of the group attacking the Village Hotel in [[Bosaso]]. A fierce shootout ensued, with the hotel's guards eventually repelling the attackers. At least four guards and two ISS fighters died during the fighting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/02/islamic-state-claims-hotel-attack-in-northern-somalia.php|title=Islamic State claims hotel attack in northern Somalia|author=Caleb Weiss|work=[[Long War Journal]]|date=9 February 2017|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref> On 28 March 2017, ISS [[List of terrorist incidents in March 2017|ambushed]] a convoy of Puntland soldiers near Qandala.

Meanwhile, ISS started to launch assassination attempts in the region around Mogadishu from November 2017, with the town [[Afgooye]] most affected.{{sfnp|Anzalone|2018|p=16}} From then on, the group greatly increased its rate of attacks on government targets.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} By May 2018, ISS had reportedly carried out eleven attacks and killed 23 people who had allegedly worked for the government, such as intelligence agents, soldiers, officials, and policemen. In response to these assaults, the [[National Intelligence and Security Agency]] started to arrest suspected ISS members in and around Mogadishu.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2018/05/analysis-islamic-state-ramps-up-attack-claims-in-somalia.php |title=Analysis: Islamic State ramps up attack claims in Somalia |author=Caleb Weiss |work=[[Long War Journal]] |date=9 May 2018 |accessdate=14 June 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2018/05/somali-intelligence-agency-arrests-two-islamic-state-members-in-mogadishu.php |title=Somali intelligence agency arrests two Islamic State members in Mogadishu |author=Caleb Weiss |work=[[Long War Journal]] |date=24 May 2018 |accessdate=14 June 2018 }}</ref> ISS also abducted nine people in the region around Qandala in January 2018, including some off-duty soldiers.

The group also grew more sophisticated and further expanded its presence throughout Somalia. It had begun to collect taxes (essentially [[Protection racket|protection money]]) on businesses in Bosaso by August 2018, greatly increasing its revenue.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} At some point in 2018, ISS managed to convince a significant number of al-Shabaab militants to defect, resulting in the formation of an Islamic State cell in [[Beledweyne]].{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|pp=30–31}} As result of its increasing activity in central and southern Somalia, the rivalry between ISS and al-Shabaab reignited in full, with several clashes occurring between the groups. In October 2018, al-Shabaab probably executed ISS depuy Mahad Maalin in Mogadishu,{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=31}} while Islamic State forces ambushed an al-Shabaab group near B'ir Mirali southwest of Qandala, reportedly killing 14 rival militants.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=32}} The growing violence between the two jihadist rebel factions resulted in al-Shabaab central command releasing a speech as well as an 18-page treatise on 20 December 2018. In these works, the Islamic State  was sharply rebuked as corrupt, apostate, and seditionist force, while al-Shabaab authorized its loyalists to destroy ISS elements as \"disease in the Jihad\". This amounted to an official [[declaration of war]].{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=32}}

In the next months, the two factions greatly increased their attacks against each other: They clashed near [[El Adde]] in December 2018, and at numerous locations in Puntland between January and March 2019. ISS reportedly suffered one major setback during these clashes when it lost one of its main bases in the Dasaan area to al-Shabaab.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=32}} Regardless, neither organizations appears to have suffered to a tangible degree from this inter-rebel fighting, and both have continued to strike government targets.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=33}} The United States Air Force carried out an airstrike against ISS on 14 April 2019, killing its deputy Abdihakim Mohamed Ibrahim at Xiriiro, Bari region.<ref name=\"no2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.voanews.com/africa/us-confirms-airstrike-kills-deputy-leader-militants-somalia |title=US Confirms Airstrike Kills Deputy Leader of IS Militants in Somalia |work=Voice of America |author=Carla Babb |date=15 April 2019 |access-date=17 August 2019}}</ref> On 12 July 2019, ISS militants clashed with security forces near the Safa hotel in Puntland's capital, Bosaso, the same day as an al-Shabaab attack on a hotel in [[Kismayo]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2019/07/kismayo-hotel-raided-by-shabaab.php|title=Kismayo hotel raided by Shabaab|date=12 July 2019|work=Long War Journal|access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref> The United States Air Force bombed an ISS base in the [[Golis Mountains]] on 8 May 2019, reportedly killing 13 militants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thedefensepost.com/2019/05/09/somalia-us-airstrike-kills-13-isis-africom/ |title=US airstrike kills 13 Somalia ISIS fighters, AFRICOM says |work=Defense Post |author=Joanne Stocker |date=9 May 2019 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref>

On 27 October 2019, ISIL Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in the [[Barisha raid]], whereupon the organisation's central command elected [[Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi]] as new leader. On 4 November, the Islamic State in Somalia officially pledged allegiance to al-Qurashi.{{sfnp|West|2020|p=5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.voanews.com/south-central-asia/us-takes-notice-more-islamic-state-branches-back-new-leader |title=US Takes Notice as More Islamic State Branches Back New Leader |work=Voice of America |author=Jeff Seldin |date=6 November 2019 |access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271021|title=Somali ISIS affiliate swears allegiance to new leader|work=Israel National News|language=en|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref> By this time, ISS was regarded as important element in ISIL's international network, but still suffered from an inability to expand due to pressure by  al-Shabaab, the Somali Armed Forces, and the [[United States Armed Forces]]. From late 2019, the group consequently attempted to become more active beyond Somalia's borders, as its forces tried to infiltrate Ethiopia and recruit new forces there.{{sfnp|West|2020|pp=5–6}} Its operations in Ethiopia were repeatedly crushed by local security forces, and several militants were arrested.{{sfnp|West|2020|p=6}}<ref name=\"trains\">{{cite web|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2019/09/islamic-state-trains-in-somalias-puntland.php |title=Islamic State trains in Somalia's Puntland |author=Caleb Weiss |work=[[Long War Journal]] |date=22 September 2019 |accessdate=19 March 2020 }}</ref> ISS had also set up a new training camp, codenamed \"Dawoud al Somali\", probably in northern Puntland.<ref name=\"trains\" />

== Organisation ==
[[File:Puntland new regions map.jpg|thumb|right|ISS is primarily active in the eastern Galaga Mountains, which mostly lie in the Bari region of [[Puntland]].]]

The Islamic State in Somalia is led by Abdul Qadir Mumin, whose role for the continued existence of the group has been judged to be extremely important.{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=31}} Described as \"eloquent and persuasive, [...] very savvy and sophisticated\", Mumin is deeply involved in international jihadism and considered to be an extremely dangerous terrorist leader. After reports circulated in June/July 2017 that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been killed, terror expert Candyce Kelshall even speculated that Mumin might be tempted to declare himself the new caliph of ISIL.<ref name=\"British jihadi\" /> Mumin's direct control is however limited to ISS forces in northern Somalia. Though pro-ISIL cells in the southern parts of the country have probably accepted Mumin as their official leader,{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|pp=27, 28}} the exact relationship between the northern and southern groups of ISS remains unclear. It is possible that the latter only have nominal links to the northern branch or no actual contact at all.{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=28}} In any case, the southern cells remain mostly weak and exist in a precarious state, constantly threatened by al-Shabaab.{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|pp=27, 28}}

Besides Mumin, two other ISS commanders were known: Mahad Maalin served as field commander<ref name=\"retake\"/> and deputy of the group until his death in October 2018.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} He was succeeded as deputy by Abdihakim Mohamed Ibrahim, alias \"Dhoqob\", who was believed to be Mumin's \"right-hand man\". Dhoqob was killed on 14 April 2019, and his death was portrayed by the [[United States Africa Command]] as major blow to ISS.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20190415-us-confirms-killing-no2-islamic-state-leader-somalia |title=US confirms killing No.2 Islamic State leader in Somalia |work=France24 |author=AFP |date=15 April 2019 |access-date=17 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"no2\"/>

Though it is probable{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=30}} that ISS controls a relatively small territory in Puntland's mountainous hinterland,<ref name=\"Vow Revenge\" /> the group is not known to have attempted to set up something resembling a government at any point of its existence. ISS' current areas are only very sparsely settled or not populated at all,{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=30}} while Qandala's civilian population completely fled during its occupation by the militants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/somali-town-qandala-puntland-islamic-state/3611903.html|title=Last Resident Leaves Somali Town Taken by Islamic State|author=Harun Maruf|work=[[Voice of America]]|date=25 November 2016|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref> By November 2019, ISS controlled the villages of Dhasaan and Shebaab in Bari region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/S_2019_858_E.pdf|title=Letter dated 1 November 2019 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee pursuant to resolution 751 (1992) concerning Somalia addressed to the President of the Security Council|page=84|date=1 November 2019}}</ref> The group is known to use caves as hiding places.<ref name=\"Survives Strike\"/>

=== Military strength ===
The strength of the Islamic State in Somalia fluctuated over time, and is not known with certainty. Mumin's initial cell was estimated at about 20 members, growing to less than 100 by August 2016. At the time of the Qandala campaign, a former [[Puntland Intelligence Agency]] official argued that ISS counted 200 to 300 militants. Following its defeat at Qandala, local observers judged that the group declined to just 70–150 members by June 2017.{{sfnp|Warner|Hulme|2018|p=24}} The Islamic State in Somalia subsequently recruited new fighters to alleviate its manpower shortage, though Somali journalists gave widely different accounts on the success of this recruitment drive. Accordingly, ISS was believed to be between 100 and 300 militants strong by mid-2018.{{sfnp|Warner|Hulme|2018|pp=24–25}} The vast majority of ISS members are Somalis, with only a few [[Mujahideen#Somalia|foreign mujahideen]] fighting for the group, including Sudanese, Yemenis,{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=30}}<ref name=\"footprint\" /> Ethiopians,<ref name=\"holidays\"/> and Egyptians.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=31}}

=== Propaganda ===
The propaganda of ISS is generally extremely inferior compared to its direct rival al-Shabaab. The Islamic State in Somalia initially had no media wing of its own and also has not organized a \"robust informal media presence\".{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=31}} Instead, it mostly relies on the existing propaganda channels of ISIL, such as the [[Amaq News Agency]],{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=31}} the Al Naba newsletter ,{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=31}} the ''Global Front to Support the Islamic State'', and the media arms of other ISIL branches in [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Yemen]], [[Egypt]], and [[Libya]].{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=29}} The propaganda video of December 2017 that declared ISS a province, however, also claimed to have been produced by the \"Media Office of Wilayat al Somal\".<ref name=\"holidays\"/> In late 2019, ISS began releasing propaganda in [[Amharic]], a language widely spoken in Ethiopia, in an attempt to attract new recruits there.{{sfnp|West|2020|p=6}}

== Supply, support and allies ==
{{further|Piracy off the coast of Somalia}}
In its endeavor to build up its military strength, the Islamic State in Somalia is aided by the fact that Puntland's government has only limited control over its hinterland while its military is overstrechted. Peripheral areas are thus mostly ignored by the security forces and instead run by rebellious and infighting tribal militias. As result, local clans (including Mumin's own, the [[Majeerteen]] Ali Saleban) are aggrieved by their perceived marginalisation by the government and in some cases ready to support ISS. Such dissatisfied elements are the ones from which ISS receives supplies and recruits new members.<ref name=\"puntland state\" /><ref name=\"growing threat\" />{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} There have also been accounts, however, that ISS raids those communities which do not supply it with food and other necessities,<ref name=\"surrender\" /> and to kidnap children in order to indoctrinate and train them as child soldiers.<ref name=\"list global\" /> The group is also known to collect taxes in areas which it controls or at least influences.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}}

The group is also directly supported by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Yemen Province]], which is known to have sent experts, trainers, money, weapons and other materials to ISS.<ref name=\"vow\" /> The [[United Nations]] also claimed in November 2017 that ISS receives direct assistance from ISIL officials in [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]].{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=30}}<ref name=\"footprint\" /> In smuggling fighters and supplies across the [[Gulf of Aden]], ISS works closely with [[Piracy off the coast of Somalia|Somali pirates]], namely Mohamed Garfanje's Hobyo-Haradhere Piracy Network and another unidentified group that is based in Qandala. These pirates do, however, also supply ISS' rival in Puntland, al-Shabaab, with weapons and other materials.<ref name=\"pirate kings\" />

Furthermore, ISS has been supported by \"financial operative\" Mohamed Mire Ali Yusuf (often simply called Mire Ali) who provided the group with money and supplies through two companies, both located in Bosaso by 2016: Liibaan Trading, a [[Animal husbandry|livestock trading]] business, and Al-Mutafaq Commercial Company. The [[United States Department of the Treasury]] designated Mire as terrorist and sanctioned his two businesses in February 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2018/02/us-terror-designations-expose-3-international-facilitators-for-islamic-state.php |title=US terror designations expose 3 international facilitators for Islamic State |author=Thomas Joscelyn |work=[[Long War Journal]] |date=10 February 2018 |accessdate=22 June 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-release/sm0284 |title=Treasury Sanctions ISIS Facilitators Across the Globe |author= |work=[[United States Department of the Treasury]] |date=9 February 2018 |accessdate=22 June 2018 }}</ref>

According to a ''[[New York Times]]'' report, [[Qatar]] may have financed and directed an Islamic State attack in Puntland on 10 May in order to pressure the [[United Arab Emirates]] to end development of a port in Bosaso and to have the contract replaced with Qatar.

The '''Islamic State in Somalia''' (short: '''ISS''') or '''Abnaa ul-Calipha''' is an [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]-affiliated group that primarily operates in the mountainous areas of [[Puntland]], though has also claimed responsibility for several terrorist attacks throughout the rest of [[Somalia]]. Led by Sheikh [[Abdul Qadir Mumin]], the group is estimated to have up to 300 active fighters. Since its formation, ISS probably managed to take control of a small, sparsely populated territory in northern Somalia's mountainous hinterland, though it was not acknowledged as [[ISIL territorial claims|official province]] (\"Wilayat\") by ISIL's central leadership until December 2017. Since then, it has sometimes been called '''Somalia Province''' (\"Wilayat al Somal\") by pro-ISIL media. ISS is also the declared enemy of [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], which considers the Islamic State a significant threat to its own predominance among Jihadist factions in Somalia.

== History ==
=== Origins and formation ===
[[File:LocationPuntland3.png|thumb|left|Location of [[Puntland]] (blue) in [[Somalia]] ]]

The origins of the Islamic State in Somalia trace back to 2012, when [[Abdul Qadir Mumin]] was sent by the al-Shabaab leadership to its remote outpost in Puntland, far from the insurgent group's primary areas of operation in southern Somalia. As cleric with little military experience, Mumin's role in Puntland was originally to attract recruits for the numerical small and militarily weak local al-Shabaab group, which was led by [[Mohamed Said Atom]] at the time. In course of the [[Galgala campaign]] in 2014, however, Atom defected to the government, and Mumin was forced to take control of the Puntland group. Isolated in the remote north and feeling increasingly distanced from al-Shabaab, Mumin began to consider himself more and more independent.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}}

Meanwhile, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant had launched a propaganda campaign to convince al-Shabaab to join to them, which was \"angrily refused\" by al-Shabaab's central leadership.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}} Despite this, several groups of al-Shabaab members found ISIL's ideology attractive or saw this new Jihadist organization as a way to challenge al-Shabaab's leadership at the time. Thus, several small pro-ISIL groups emerged in southern Somalia. This was however not tolerated by the Somali organization, which released statements condemning dissenters{{efn|name=fn1|Al-Shabaab radio stations for example declared in November 2015: \"If anyone says he belongs to another Islamic movement [other than that of al-Qa'ida], kill him on the spot ... we will cut the throat of anyone ... if they undermine unity.\" Al-Shabaab spokesman Ali Mahmud Rage similarly claimed that dissenters in the organization were \"infidels\" who would be \"burnt in hell\".{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=28}} }} and ordered its internal security service Amniyat to arrest or kill pro-ISIL elements such as Hussein Abdi Gedi's faction in [[Middle Juba]].{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=29}}

Mumin, however, long dissatisfied with his situation, pledged ''[[bay'ah]]'' to [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]] and the Islamic State in October 2015. This caused a violent split within Puntland's al-Shabaab, as only 20 of the 300 local Islamist fighters joined Mumin,{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}}<ref name=\"port town\">{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/10/islamic-state-in-somalia-claims-capture-of-port-town.php|title=Islamic State in Somalia claims capture of port town|author=Caleb Weiss|publisher=[[Long War Journal]]|date=26 October 2016|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref> while the al-Shabaab loyalists attempted to kill these defectors. Mumin's small group proceeded to form ''Abnaa ul-Calipha'', better known as ''Islamic State in Somalia'', and to evade their erstwhile comrades, while recruiting new members for their cause.<ref name=\"vow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/somali-officials-vow-to-retake-puntland-town/3570974.html|title=Somali Officials Vow to Retake Puntland Town|author=Harun Maruf|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|date=28 October 2016|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref> Al-Baghdadi and the ISIL leadership did not acknowledge Mumin's bay'ah, instead choosing to wait and see how the Islamic State in Somalia fared.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}} While Mumin's group in the north thus managed to survive, the situation of pro-ISIL forces in southern Somalia consequently became even more precarious. In two notable incidents in November and December 2015, al-Shabaab attacked and destroyed two of the most important southern ISIL cells, namely the ones of Bashir Abu Numan and Mohammad Makkawi Ibrahim. Pro-government forces such as the [[Somali Armed Forces]] and [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]] also claimed to have targeted southern ISIL groups. As result, ISIL forces in southern Somialia remained very weak,{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|pp=28, 29}} and those that survived appear to have accepted Mumin's authority over time, formally becoming part of ISS.{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|pp=27, 28}} As result, the \"disparate clump of pro-Islamic State cells\" in Somalia transformed into an \"organized group\".{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=29}}

=== Rise in power and Qandala campaign ===

In March 2016, an ISS cell in southern Puntland was pursued by al-Shabaab fighters into [[Mudug]]; the pursuers were however attacked and completely defeated by the [[Puntland Dervish Force]] and [[Military of Galmudug|Galmudug soldiers]], thus unintentionally allowing the Islamic State militants to escape into safety.<ref name=\"puntland state\">{{cite web|url=https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/horn-africa/somalia/islamic-state-threat-somalias-puntland-state|title=The Islamic State Threat in Somalia’s Puntland State |author1=Zakaria Yusuf |author2=Abdul Khalif |work=[[International Crisis Group]] |date=17 November 2016|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref> From this point onwards, ISS and al-Shabaab temporarily ceased fighting each other with the exception of some isolated incidents.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} Over the following months Mumin's followers built up their strength, and by April 2016 they had set up a temporary training camp named after Bashir Abu Numan, the ISIL follower mentioned above who had been killed by al-Shabaab in November 2015.<ref name=\"camp\" />{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=29}} In one of the group's propaganda videos, Mumin blessed the makeshift base as the \"first camp of the Caliphate in Somalia\". On 25 April, ISS also carried out its first attack on government forces, when one of its fighters detonated an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] against an [[African Union Mission to Somalia|AMISOM]] vehicle in [[Mogadishu]].<ref name=\"camp\" /> By August 2016, Mumin's cell still remained very small, probably under 100 militants, and was not yet very active. According to the [[United States Department of State]], however, ISS began to expand in size by abducting and indoctrinating boys between 10 and 15 and employing them as [[Military use of children|child soldiers]].<ref name=\"list global\">{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/08/us-adds-islamic-state-commander-in-somalia-to-list-of-global-terrorists.php|title=US adds Islamic State commander in Somalia to list of global terrorists|author=Bill Roggio|publisher=[[Long War Journal]]|date=31 August 2016|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>

By October 2016, ISS had claimed less than one dozen attacks overall since its foundation, showing that the group was still relatively weak. Nevertheless, the fact that many of these strikes had taken place in Mogadishu, indicated that ISS had become able to operate throughout wider Somalia, not just in its core regions in Puntland.<ref name=\"port town\" /> Experts also estimated that Mumin's cell had significantly grown to up to 300 fighters. On 26 October, the group eventually launched their first major operation by [[Qandala campaign|targeting]] the major port town of [[Qandala]]. The town had both symbolic as well as strategic significance, as it could allow ISS to bolster their local support and receive more supplies from Yemen. The Islamic State fighters managed to overrun the town, meeting little resistance, and thereafter controlled it largely unchallenged until 3 December. On that day, the [[Puntland Security Force]] launched a counter-offensive, and after sporadic fighting for four days, retook Qandala on 7 December 2016.<ref name=\"vow\" /><ref name=\"retake\">{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/forces-retake-somali-town-held-by-pro-islamic-state-fighters/3626738.html|title=Forces Retake Somali Town Held by Pro-Islamic State Fighters |author=Harun Maruf|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|date=7 December 2016|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref>{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}} Mumin's men were forced to retreat to El Ladid, a village 30 kilometers south of Qandala, where government forces once again attacked and scattered them on 18 December.<ref name=\"base\">{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/regional-somali-forces-destroy-islamic-state-base/3642109.html|title=Regional Somali Forces 'Destroy' Islamic State Base |author=Mohamed Olad Hassan|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref> Overall, ISS suffered numerous casualties during the Qandala campaign,<ref name=\"retake\" /> but had scored a symbolic victory nonetheless, having captured and held a major town for more than a month.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}} Having established a new headquarters in the al-Mishkat Mountains, ISS subsequently managed to attract new recruits, mostly children and orphans, though also some new defectors from al-Shabaab.<ref name=\"growing threat\">{{cite web|url=http://eastwest.eu/en/opinioni/sub-saharan-monitor/the-growing-threat-of-islamic-state-in-somalia|title=The growing threat of Islamic State in Somalia|author=Marco Cochi |work=EastWest |date=26 May 2016|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref> It also became generally more active.{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=27}}

=== Expanded terrorist attacks and announcement of Wilayat al Somal ===
[[File:Bosasintvilhot.jpg|thumb|left|ISS launched an unsuccessful attack on the Village Hotel in [[Bosaso]] in February 2017 ]]

The Qandala campaign resulted in the Puntland government as well as the [[African Union]] taking ISS more seriously, with both taking more steps to counter ISS' growing strength.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}} In addition, ISS began to cooperate with al-Shabaab to a limited degree during the subsequent months.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=33}} On 8 February 2017, ISS launched its next major attack in Puntland, with several militants of the group attacking the Village Hotel in [[Bosaso]]. A fierce shootout ensued, with the hotel's guards eventually repelling the attackers. At least four guards and two ISS fighters died during the fighting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/02/islamic-state-claims-hotel-attack-in-northern-somalia.php|title=Islamic State claims hotel attack in northern Somalia|author=Caleb Weiss|work=[[Long War Journal]]|date=9 February 2017|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref> On 28 March 2017, ISS [[List of terrorist incidents in March 2017|ambushed]] a convoy of Puntland soldiers near Qandala.

Meanwhile, ISS started to launch assassination attempts in the region around Mogadishu from November 2017, with the town [[Afgooye]] most affected.{{sfnp|Anzalone|2018|p=16}} From then on, the group greatly increased its rate of attacks on government targets.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} By May 2018, ISS had reportedly carried out eleven attacks and killed 23 people who had allegedly worked for the government, such as intelligence agents, soldiers, officials, and policemen. In response to these assaults, the [[National Intelligence and Security Agency]] started to arrest suspected ISS members in and around Mogadishu.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2018/05/analysis-islamic-state-ramps-up-attack-claims-in-somalia.php |title=Analysis: Islamic State ramps up attack claims in Somalia |author=Caleb Weiss |work=[[Long War Journal]] |date=9 May 2018 |accessdate=14 June 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2018/05/somali-intelligence-agency-arrests-two-islamic-state-members-in-mogadishu.php |title=Somali intelligence agency arrests two Islamic State members in Mogadishu |author=Caleb Weiss |work=[[Long War Journal]] |date=24 May 2018 |accessdate=14 June 2018 }}</ref> ISS also abducted nine people in the region around Qandala in January 2018, including some off-duty soldiers.

The group also grew more sophisticated and further expanded its presence throughout Somalia. It had begun to collect taxes (essentially [[Protection racket|protection money]]) on businesses in Bosaso by August 2018, greatly increasing its revenue.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} At some point in 2018, ISS managed to convince a significant number of al-Shabaab militants to defect, resulting in the formation of an Islamic State cell in [[Beledweyne]].{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|pp=30–31}} As result of its increasing activity in central and southern Somalia, the rivalry between ISS and al-Shabaab reignited in full, with several clashes occurring between the groups. In October 2018, al-Shabaab probably executed ISS depuy Mahad Maalin in Mogadishu,{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=31}} while Islamic State forces ambushed an al-Shabaab group near B'ir Mirali southwest of Qandala, reportedly killing 14 rival militants.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=32}} The growing violence between the two jihadist rebel factions resulted in al-Shabaab central command releasing a speech as well as an 18-page treatise on 20 December 2018. In these works, the Islamic State  was sharply rebuked as corrupt, apostate, and seditionist force, while al-Shabaab authorized its loyalists to destroy ISS elements as \"disease in the Jihad\". This amounted to an official [[declaration of war]].{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=32}}

In the next months, the two factions greatly increased their attacks against each other: They clashed near [[El Adde]] in December 2018, and at numerous locations in Puntland between January and March 2019. ISS reportedly suffered one major setback during these clashes when it lost one of its main bases in the Dasaan area to al-Shabaab.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=32}} Regardless, neither organizations appears to have suffered to a tangible degree from this inter-rebel fighting, and both have continued to strike government targets.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=33}} The United States Air Force carried out an airstrike against ISS on 14 April 2019, killing its deputy Abdihakim Mohamed Ibrahim at Xiriiro, Bari region.<ref name=\"no2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.voanews.com/africa/us-confirms-airstrike-kills-deputy-leader-militants-somalia |title=US Confirms Airstrike Kills Deputy Leader of IS Militants in Somalia |work=Voice of America |author=Carla Babb |date=15 April 2019 |access-date=17 August 2019}}</ref> On 12 July 2019, ISS militants clashed with security forces near the Safa hotel in Puntland's capital, Bosaso, the same day as an al-Shabaab attack on a hotel in [[Kismayo]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2019/07/kismayo-hotel-raided-by-shabaab.php|title=Kismayo hotel raided by Shabaab|date=12 July 2019|work=Long War Journal|access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref> The United States Air Force bombed an ISS base in the [[Golis Mountains]] on 8 May 2019, reportedly killing 13 militants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thedefensepost.com/2019/05/09/somalia-us-airstrike-kills-13-isis-africom/ |title=US airstrike kills 13 Somalia ISIS fighters, AFRICOM says |work=Defense Post |author=Joanne Stocker |date=9 May 2019 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref>

On 27 October 2019, ISIL Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in the [[Barisha raid]], whereupon the organisation's central command elected [[Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi]] as new leader. On 4 November, the Islamic State in Somalia officially pledged allegiance to al-Qurashi.{{sfnp|West|2020|p=5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.voanews.com/south-central-asia/us-takes-notice-more-islamic-state-branches-back-new-leader |title=US Takes Notice as More Islamic State Branches Back New Leader |work=Voice of America |author=Jeff Seldin |date=6 November 2019 |access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271021|title=Somali ISIS affiliate swears allegiance to new leader|work=Israel National News|language=en|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref> By this time, ISS was regarded as important element in ISIL's international network, but still suffered from an inability to expand due to pressure by  al-Shabaab, the Somali Armed Forces, and the [[United States Armed Forces]]. From late 2019, the group consequently attempted to become more active beyond Somalia's borders, as its forces tried to infiltrate Ethiopia and recruit new forces there.{{sfnp|West|2020|pp=5–6}} Its operations in Ethiopia were repeatedly crushed by local security forces, and several militants were arrested.{{sfnp|West|2020|p=6}}<ref name=\"trains\">{{cite web|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2019/09/islamic-state-trains-in-somalias-puntland.php |title=Islamic State trains in Somalia's Puntland |author=Caleb Weiss |work=[[Long War Journal]] |date=22 September 2019 |accessdate=19 March 2020 }}</ref> ISS had also set up a new training camp, codenamed \"Dawoud al Somali\", probably in northern Puntland.<ref name=\"trains\" />

== Organisation ==
[[File:Puntland new regions map.jpg|thumb|right|ISS is primarily active in the eastern Galaga Mountains, which mostly lie in the Bari region of [[Puntland]].]]

The Islamic State in Somalia is led by Abdul Qadir Mumin, whose role for the continued existence of the group has been judged to be extremely important.{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=31}} Described as \"eloquent and persuasive, [...] very savvy and sophisticated\", Mumin is deeply involved in international jihadism and considered to be an extremely dangerous terrorist leader. After reports circulated in June/July 2017 that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been killed, terror expert Candyce Kelshall even speculated that Mumin might be tempted to declare himself the new caliph of ISIL.<ref name=\"British jihadi\" /> Mumin's direct control is however limited to ISS forces in northern Somalia. Though pro-ISIL cells in the southern parts of the country have probably accepted Mumin as their official leader,{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|pp=27, 28}} the exact relationship between the northern and southern groups of ISS remains unclear. It is possible that the latter only have nominal links to the northern branch or no actual contact at all.{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=28}} In any case, the southern cells remain mostly weak and exist in a precarious state, constantly threatened by al-Shabaab.{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|pp=27, 28}}

Besides Mumin, two other ISS commanders were known: Mahad Maalin served as field commander<ref name=\"retake\"/> and deputy of the group until his death in October 2018.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} He was succeeded as deputy by Abdihakim Mohamed Ibrahim, alias \"Dhoqob\", who was believed to be Mumin's \"right-hand man\". Dhoqob was killed on 14 April 2019, and his death was portrayed by the [[United States Africa Command]] as major blow to ISS.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20190415-us-confirms-killing-no2-islamic-state-leader-somalia |title=US confirms killing No.2 Islamic State leader in Somalia |work=France24 |author=AFP |date=15 April 2019 |access-date=17 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"no2\"/>

Though it is probable{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=30}} that ISS controls a relatively small territory in Puntland's mountainous hinterland,<ref name=\"Vow Revenge\" /> the group is not known to have attempted to set up something resembling a government at any point of its existence. ISS' current areas are only very sparsely settled or not populated at all,{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=30}} while Qandala's civilian population completely fled during its occupation by the militants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/somali-town-qandala-puntland-islamic-state/3611903.html|title=Last Resident Leaves Somali Town Taken by Islamic State|author=Harun Maruf|work=[[Voice of America]]|date=25 November 2016|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref> By November 2019, ISS controlled the villages of Dhasaan and Shebaab in Bari region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/S_2019_858_E.pdf|title=Letter dated 1 November 2019 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee pursuant to resolution 751 (1992) concerning Somalia addressed to the President of the Security Council|page=84|date=1 November 2019}}</ref> The group is known to use caves as hiding places.<ref name=\"Survives Strike\"/>

=== Military strength ===
The strength of the Islamic State in Somalia fluctuated over time, and is not known with certainty. Mumin's initial cell was estimated at about 20 members, growing to less than 100 by August 2016. At the time of the Qandala campaign, a former [[Puntland Intelligence Agency]] official argued that ISS counted 200 to 300 militants. Following its defeat at Qandala, local observers judged that the group declined to just 70–150 members by June 2017.{{sfnp|Warner|Hulme|2018|p=24}} The Islamic State in Somalia subsequently recruited new fighters to alleviate its manpower shortage, though Somali journalists gave widely different accounts on the success of this recruitment drive. Accordingly, ISS was believed to be between 100 and 300 militants strong by mid-2018.{{sfnp|Warner|Hulme|2018|pp=24–25}} The vast majority of ISS members are Somalis, with only a few [[Mujahideen#Somalia|foreign mujahideen]] fighting for the group, including Sudanese, a Yemenis,{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=30}}<ref name=\"footprint\" /> Ethiopians,<ref name=\"holidays\"/> and Egyptians.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=31}}

=== Propaganda ===
The propaganda of ISS is generally extremely inferior compared to its direct rival al-Shabaab. The Islamic State in Somalia initially had no media wing of its own and also has not organized a \"robust informal media presence\".{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=31}} Instead, it mostly relies on the existing propaganda channels of ISIL, such as the [[Amaq News Agency]],{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=31}} the Al Naba newsletter ,{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=31}} the ''Global Front to Support the Islamic State'', and the media arms of other ISIL branches in [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Yemen]], [[Egypt]], and [[Libya]].{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=29}} The propaganda video of December 2017 that declared ISS a province, however, also claimed to have been produced by the \"Media Office of Wilayat al Somal\".<ref name=\"holidays\"/> In late 2019, ISS began releasing propaganda in [[Amharic]], a language widely spoken in Ethiopia, in an attempt to attract new recruits there.{{sfnp|West|2020|p=6}}

== Supply, support and allies ==
{{further|Piracy off the coast of Somalia}}
In its endeavor to build up its military strength, the Islamic State in Somalia is aided by the fact that Puntland's government has only limited control over its hinterland while its military is overstrechted. Peripheral areas are thus mostly ignored by the security forces and instead run by rebellious and infighting tribal militias. As result, local clans (including Mumin's own, the [[Majeerteen]] Ali Saleban) are aggrieved by their perceived marginalisation by the government and in some cases ready to support ISS. Such dissatisfied elements are the ones from which ISS receives supplies and recruits new members.<ref name=\"puntland state\" /><ref name=\"growing threat\" />{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} There have also been accounts, however, that ISS raids those communities which do not supply it with food and other necessities,<ref name=\"surrender\" /> and to kidnap children in order to indoctrinate and train them as child soldiers.<ref name=\"list global\" /> The group is also known to collect taxes in areas which it controls or at least influences.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}}

The group is also directly supported by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Yemen Province]], which is known to have sent experts, trainers, money, weapons and other materials to ISS.<ref name=\"vow\" /> The [[United Nations]] also claimed in November 2017 that ISS receives direct assistance from ISIL officials in [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]].{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=30}}<ref name=\"footprint\" /> In smuggling fighters and supplies across the [[Gulf of Aden]], ISS works closely with [[Piracy off the coast of Somalia|Somali pirates]], namely Mohamed Garfanje's Hobyo-Haradhere Piracy Network and another unidentified group that is based in Qandala. These pirates do, however, also supply ISS' rival in Puntland, al-Shabaab, with weapons and other materials.<ref name=\"pirate kings\" />

Furthermore, ISS has been supported by \"financial operative\" Mohamed Mire Ali Yusuf (often simply called Mire Ali) who provided the group with money and supplies through two companies, both located in Bosaso by 2016: Liibaan Trading, a [[Animal husbandry|livestock trading]] business, and Al-Mutafaq Commercial Company. The [[United States Department of the Treasury]] designated Mire as terrorist and sanctioned his two businesses in February 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2018/02/us-terror-designations-expose-3-international-facilitators-for-islamic-state.php |title=US terror designations expose 3 international facilitators for Islamic State |author=Thomas Joscelyn |work=[[Long War Journal]] |date=10 February 2018 |accessdate=22 June 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-release/sm0284 |title=Treasury Sanctions ISIS Facilitators Across the Globe |author= |work=[[United States Department of the Treasury]] |date=9 February 2018 |accessdate=22 June 2018 }}</ref>

{{see also|Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism}}
According to a ''[[New York Times]]'' report, [[Qatar]] may have financed and directed an Islamic State attack in Puntland on 10 May in order to pressure the [[United Arab Emirates]] to end development of a port in Bosaso and to have the contract replaced with Qatar. An influential Qatari businessman named Khalifa al-Muhannadi reportedly claimed Qatari involvement in the attack in a phone call to Qatar's ambassador to the [[Federal Government of Somalia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/world/africa/somalia-qatar-uae.html|title=With Guns, Cash and Terrorism, Gulf States Vie for Power in Somalia|website=New York Times|date=July 22, 2019}}</ref> Neither Muhannadi nor the ambassador denied the phone call took place, but Qatar claimed al-Muhannadi acted independently while also criticizing the report.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/07/qatar-somalia-deny-nyt-bombing-news-report-190723204815882.html|title=Qatar and Somalia deny NYT's bombing news report|website=Al Jazeera|date=July 23, 2019}}</ref>

\"'''Make America Great Again'''\" (often abbreviated as '''MAGA''') is a [[campaign slogan]] used in [[American politics]] that was popularized by [[Donald Trump]] in his successful [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 presidential campaign]]. [[Ronald Reagan]] used the similar slogan \"'''Let's make America great again'''\" in his successful [[Ronald Reagan 1980 presidential campaign|1980 presidential campaign]]. 

[[Bill Clinton]] also used the phrase in speeches during his successful [[Bill Clinton 1992 presidential campaign|1992 presidential campaign]] and again in a radio commercial aired for his wife [[Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign|Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential primary campaign]].

[[File:Make America Great Again hat (27149010964).jpg|thumb|Trump popularized the slogan \"Make America Great Again\" by stitching it onto his widely distributed cap.|alt=]]

Trump himself began using the slogan formally on November 7, 2012, the day after [[2012 United States presidential election|Barack Obama won his reelection against Mitt Romney]]. By his own account, Trump first considered \"We Will Make America Great\", but did not feel like it had the right \"ring\" to it. \"Make America Great\" was his next slogan idea, but upon further reflection, he felt that it was a slight to America because it implied that America was never great.

\"'''Make America Great Again'''\" (often abbreviated as '''MAGA''') is a [[campaign slogan]] used in [[American politics]] that was popularized by [[Donald Trump]] in his successful [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 presidential campaign]].

Trump himself began using the slogan formally on November 7, 2012, the day after [[2012 United States presidential election|Barack Obama won his reelection against Mitt Romney]]. By his own account, Trump first considered \"We Will Make America Great\", but did not feel like it had the right \"ring\" to it. \"Make America Great\" was his next slogan idea, but upon further reflection, he felt that it was a slight to America because it implied that America was never great. After selecting \"Make America Great Again\", Trump immediately had an attorney register it. (Trump later said that he was unaware of Reagan's use in 1980 until 2015, but noted that \"he didn't trademark it\".)<ref name=\"tumulty20170118\" /> On November 12 he signed an application with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] requesting exclusive rights to use the slogan for political purposes.

'''Gaithersburg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|eɪ|ð|ər|z|.|b|ər|g}} {{pronunciation|Pronunciation of \"Gaithersburg\" (city in Maryland).ogg}}), officially the '''City of Gaithersburg''', is a city in [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], [[Maryland]], United States. At the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], Gaithersburg had a population of 59,933, making it the fourth-largest incorporated city in the state, behind [[Baltimore]], [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], and [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]].<ref>[https://www.census.gov U.S. Census website], U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved June 17, 2011.</ref> Gaithersburg is located to the northwest of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and is considered a suburb and a primary city within the [[Washington metropolitan area|Washington–Arlington–Alexandria, DC–VA–MD–WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Gaithersburg was incorporated as a town in 1878 and as a city in 1968.

Gaithersburg is divided into east and west sections, separated by [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]]. The eastern section of the city is older and is the original portion of the town before more recent growth. Landmarks and buildings from that time can still be seen in many places but especially in the historic central business district of Gaithersburg called \"Olde Towne\". The east side also includes [[Lakeforest Mall]], City Hall, and the Montgomery County Fair grounds, and Bohrer Park (a well-known joint community recreation center and outdoor water park for kids and families). The west side of the city has many wealthier neighborhoods that were designed with smart growth techniques and embrace [[New Urbanism]].  These include the award-winning [[Kentlands]] community, the Lakelands community, and the Washingtonian Center (better known as Rio), a popular shopping/business district. Consumers often come to this area during Black Friday and other shopping holidays for the deals and variety of huge brand name stores like Target and Dick's Sporting Goods, and smaller stores like Francesca's and Blue Mercury.  Two New Urbanism communities are under construction, including [[Watkins Mill Town Center]] (Casey East and West), and the massive \"Science City\".  The state has a [[bus rapid transit]] line, Corridor Cities Transitway or \"CCT\", planned for the western portion of the city starting at Shady Grove Metro Station and connecting all the high density western Gaithersburg neighborhoods with a total of eight stops planned in the city.

The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) is headquartered in Gaithersburg directly west of I-270.{{refn|Although NIST's mailing address states Gaithersburg, and the City of Gaithersburg surrounds NIST's property, the land where NIST is situated is not incorporated into the City of Gaithersburg. Instead, it is in an unincorporated part of Montgomery County. Owing to the manner in which land has been added to Gaithersburg over the years, there are multiple such unincorporated [[Enclave and exclave|enclaves]] within the perimeter; see the [https://web.archive.org/web/20050516070202/http://www.gaithersburgmd.gov:80/documents/zoning_3_2005.pdf City's Zoning Map] for details (3MB PDF).|group=N}} Other major employers in the city include [[IBM]], [[Lockheed Martin]] Information Systems and Global Services business area headquarters, [[AstraZeneca]], and the French [[multinational corporation]], [[Sodexo]].  Gaithersburg is also the location of the garrison of the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Reserve]]'s [[220th Military Police Brigade (United States)|220th Military Police Brigade]].

Gaithersburg is noted for its ethnic and economic diversity; [[WalletHub]] in 2016 ranked it first among the 313 largest U.S. cities for ethnic diversity and second for social class diversity.<ref>Richie Bernardo, [https://wallethub.com/edu/most-diverse-cities/12690/ 2016’s Most Diverse Cities in America], [[WalletHub]] (May 11, 2016) (viewed Sept. 12, 2016).</ref>

Gaithersburg was settled in 1765 as a small [[agricultural]] settlement known as Log Town near the present day Summit Hall on Ralph Crabb's 1725 land grant \"Deer Park\".<ref name=fairs>{{unbulleted list|{{cite news |title=Md. Offers Two Fairs for Sunday |last=Eddy |first=Kristin |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 17, 1987 |page=M09}}|{{cite news |title=Md.

This 1,000 acre tract became part of the landmark IBM Headquarters complex built on the then-new I-270 Interstate \"Industrial\", now \"Technology\", Corridor in the late 1960s to the 1970s. [[Benjamin Gaither]] married Henry's daughter Margaret, and Benjamin and Margaret inherited a portion of Henry's land prior to Henry's death in 1807. Gaither built his home on the land in 1802.<ref>{{cite news |title=20,000 Expected to Wish Gaithersburg Happy Birthday |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 4, 1950 |page=3 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/152229303.html}}{{closed access}}</ref> By the 1850s the area had ceased to be called Log Town and was known to inhabitants as Gaithersburg.<ref name=\"Offutt\">{{cite book |last=Offutt |first=William |author2=Sween, Jane |title=Montgomery County: Centuries of Change |publisher=American Historical Press |year=1999 |pages=166–167}}</ref>

===19th century===
The Forest Oak Post Office, named for a large tree in the town, was located in Gaither's store in 1851. However, when the railroad was built through town the new station was called Gaithersburg, an officially recognized name for the community for the first time.

The town incorporated under its current name in 1878. Gaithersburg boomed during the late 19th century and churches, schools, a mill, [[grain elevator]]s, stores, and hotels were built. Much of this development focused around the railroad station.<ref name=Offutt/>

In 1873 the [[B&O Railroad]] constructed a station at Gaithersburg,<ref name=fairs/> designed by [[Ephraim Francis Baldwin]] as part of his well-known series of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] stations in Maryland.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gaithersburg Station |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 17, 1985 |page=MDA4 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138469281.html |location=Washington, D.C.}}{{closed access}}</ref> Rapid growth occurred shortly thereafter, and on April 5, 1878 the town was officially incorporated as the Town of Gaithersburg.

In 1899, Gaithersburg was selected as one of six global locations for the construction of an [[International Latitude Observatory]] as part of a project to measure the Earth's wobble on its polar axis. The [[Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory]] is (as of 2007) the only [[National Historic Landmark]] in the City of Gaithersburg. The observatory and five others in [[Japan]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], and the [[United States]] gathered information that is still used by scientists today, along with information from [[satellites]], to determine [[polar motion]]; the size, shape, and physical properties of the earth; and to aid the space program through the precise navigational patterns of orbiting satellites. The Gaithersburg station operated until 1982 when computerization rendered the manual observation obsolete.

===Late 20th century===
In 1968, Gaithersburg was upgraded from a town to a city.

Gaithersburg remained a predominantly rural farm town until the 1970s when more construction began. As the population grew, with homes spreading throughout the area, Gaithersburg began taking on a suburban and semi-urban feel, leaving its farming roots behind. During the late 1990s and 2000s, it had become one of the most economically and ethnically diverse areas in the [[Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area|Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area]] as well as the [[Maryland|State of Maryland]], with people from all walks of life calling Gaithersburg home. This can be seen in the local schools, with [[Gaithersburg High School]] and [[Watkins Mill High School]] having two of the most diverse student bodies in the region.

During a 1997 rainstorm, the 295-year-old forest oak tree that gave its name to the Forest Oak Post Office crashed down.<ref name=goesdown>{{cite news |title=Gaithersburg Tree Goes Down in History: Storm Fells City's Famed Forest Oak |last=Vogel |first=Steve |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 28, 1997 |page=B1 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/doc/408326857.html |location=Washington, D.C. }}{{closed access}}</ref> The tree served as the inspiration for the city's logo,<ref name= goesdown/> which is also featured prominently on the city's flag.<ref name= goesdown/>

===21st century===
In 2007, parts of the film ''[[Body of Lies (film)|Body of Lies]]'' were filmed in the city, at a building on 100 Edison Park Drive. The film was released in 2008 and the building is now the [[Montgomery County Police Department]]'s headquarters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww2.gazette.net/stories/091207/potonew200048_32356.shtml|title=Spy thriller brings a touch of Hollywood to the county|date=17 March 2015|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317165446/http://ww2.gazette.net/stories/091207/potonew200048_32356.shtml|archivedate=17 March 2015}}</ref>

'''Gaithersburg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|eɪ|ð|ər|z|.|b|ər|g}} {{pronunciation|Pronunciation of \"Gaithersburg\" (city in Maryland).ogg}}), officially the '''City of Gaithersburg''', is a city in [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], [[Maryland]], United States. At the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], Gaithersburg had a population of 59,933, making it the fourth-largest incorporated city in the state, behind [[Baltimore]], [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], and [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]].<ref>[https://www.census.gov U.S. Census website], U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved June 17, 2011.</ref> Gaithersburg is located to the northwest of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and is considered a suburb and a primary city within the [[Washington metropolitan area|Washington–Arlington–Alexandria, DC–VA–MD–WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Gaithersburg was incorporated as a town in 1878 and as a city in 1968.

Gaithersburg is divided into east and west sections, separated by [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]]. The eastern section of the city is older and is the original portion of the town before more recent growth. Landmarks and buildings from that time can still be seen in many places but especially in the historic central business district of Gaithersburg called \"Olde Towne\". The east side also includes [[Lakeforest Mall]], City Hall, and the Montgomery County Fair grounds, and Bohrer Park (a well-known joint community recreation center and outdoor water park for kids and families). The west side of the city has many wealthier neighborhoods that were designed with smart growth techniques and embrace [[New Urbanism]].  These include the award-winning [[Kentlands]] community, the Lakelands community, and the Washingtonian Center (better known as Rio), a popular shopping/business district. Consumers often come to this area during Black Friday and other shopping holidays for the deals and variety of huge brand name stores like Target and Dick's Sporting Goods, and smaller stores like Francesca's and Blue Mercury.  Two New Urbanism communities are under construction, including [[Watkins Mill Town Center]] (Casey East and West), and the massive \"Science City\".  The state has a [[bus rapid transit]] line, Corridor Cities Transitway or \"CCT\", planned for the western portion of the city starting at Shady Grove Metro Station and connecting all the high density western Gaithersburg neighborhoods with a total of eight stops planned in the city.

The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) is headquartered in Gaithersburg directly west of I-270.{{refn|Although NIST's mailing address states Gaithersburg, and the City of Gaithersburg surrounds NIST's property, the land where NIST is situated is not incorporated into the City of Gaithersburg. Instead, it is in an unincorporated part of Montgomery County. Owing to the manner in which land has been added to Gaithersburg over the years, there are multiple such unincorporated [[Enclave and exclave|enclaves]] within the perimeter; see the [https://web.archive.org/web/20050516070202/http://www.gaithersburgmd.gov:80/documents/zoning_3_2005.pdf City's Zoning Map] for details (3MB PDF).|group=N}} Other major employers in the city include [[IBM]], [[Lockheed Martin]] Information Systems and Global Services business area headquarters, [[AstraZeneca]], and the French [[multinational corporation]], [[Sodexo]].  Gaithersburg is also the location of the garrison of the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Reserve]]'s [[220th Military Police Brigade (United States)|220th Military Police Brigade]].

Gaithersburg is noted for its ethnic and economic diversity; [[WalletHub]] in 2016 ranked it first among the 313 largest U.S. cities for ethnic diversity and second for social class diversity.<ref>Richie Bernardo, [https://wallethub.com/edu/most-diverse-cities/12690/ 2016’s Most Diverse Cities in America], [[WalletHub]] (May 11, 2016) (viewed Sept. 12, 2016).</ref>

Gaithersburg was settled in 1765 as a small [[agricultural]] settlement known as Log Town near the present day Summit Hall on Ralph Crabb's 1725 land grant \"Deer Park\".<ref name=fairs>{{unbulleted list|{{cite news |title=Md. Offers Two Fairs for Sunday |last=Eddy |first=Kristin |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 17, 1987 |page=M09}}|{{cite news |title=Md.

This 1,000 acre tract became part of the landmark IBM Headquarters complex built on the then-new I-270 Interstate \"Industrial\", now \"Technology\", Corridor in the late 1960s to the 1970s. [[Benjamin Gaither]] married Henry's daughter Margaret, and Benjamin and Margaret inherited a portion of Henry's land prior to Henry's death in 1807. Gaither built his home on the land in 1802.<ref>{{cite news |title=20,000 Expected to Wish Gaithersburg Happy Birthday |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 4, 1950 |page=3 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/152229303.html}}{{closed access}}</ref> By the 1850s the area had ceased to be called Log Town and was known to inhabitants as Gaithersburg.<ref name=\"Offutt\">{{cite book |last=Offutt |first=William |author2=Sween, Jane |title=Montgomery County: Centuries of Change |publisher=American Historical Press |year=1999 |pages=166–167}}</ref>

===19th century===
The Forest Oak Post Office, named for a large tree in the town, was located in Gaither's store in 1851. However, when the railroad was built through town the new station was called Gaithersburg, an officially recognized name for the community for the first time.

The town incorporated under its current name in 1878. Gaithersburg boomed during the late 19th century and churches, schools, a mill, [[grain elevator]]s, stores, and hotels were built. Much of this development focused around the railroad station.<ref name=Offutt/>

In 1873 the [[B&O Railroad]] constructed a station at Gaithersburg,<ref name=fairs/> designed by [[Ephraim Francis Baldwin]] as part of his well-known series of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] stations in Maryland.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gaithersburg Station |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 17, 1985 |page=MDA4 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138469281.html |location=Washington, D.C.}}{{closed access}}</ref> Rapid growth occurred shortly thereafter, and on April 5, 1878 the town was officially incorporated as the Town of Gaithersburg.

In 1899, Gaithersburg was selected as one of six global locations for the construction of an [[International Latitude Observatory]] as part of a project to measure the Earth's wobble on its polar axis. The [[Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory]] is (as of 2007) the only [[National Historic Landmark]] in the City of Gaithersburg. The observatory and five others in [[Japan]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], and the [[United States]] gathered information that is still used by scientists today, along with information from [[satellites]], to determine [[polar motion]]; the size, shape, and physical properties of the earth; and to aid the space program through the precise navigational patterns of orbiting satellites. The Gaithersburg station operated until 1982 when computerization rendered the manual observation obsolete.

===Late 20th century===
In 1968, Gaithersburg was upgraded from a town to a city.

Gaithersburg remained a predominantly rural farm town until the 1970s when more construction began. As the population grew, with homes spreading throughout the area, Gaithersburg began taking on a suburban and semi-urban feel, leaving its farming roots behind.

==History==
Until the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]], the general area of Lawrence County was populated primarily by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The first trace of white settlement in Lawrence County was near [[Leesville, Indiana|Leesville]]; however, [[Bono, Lawrence County, Indiana|Bono]] was the first white settlement in the county.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Lawrence County, Indiana|url=http://www.ingenweb.org/inlawrence/history.html|publisher=INGenWeb|access-date=July 26, 2016}}</ref> Lawrence County was formed in 1818 by subdividing Orange County.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Lawrence and Monroe Counties, Indiana: Their People, Industries, and Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoflawrenc00indi|year=1914|publisher=B.F.

Prior to Lawrence County's creation, it was organized as \"Leatherwood Township.\" On March 11, 1818, the county commissioners Ambrose Carlton, Thomas Beagley, and James Stotts, met at the home of James Gregory. On the third day of this session, the commissioners proceeded to divide the county into two civil townships: [[Shawswick Township, Lawrence County, Indiana|Shawswick]] and [[Spice Valley Township, Lawrence County, Indiana|Spice Valley]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lawrence County's Bicentennial|url=https://limestonecountry.com/bicentennial/|publisher=Limestone County|access-date=April 5, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=History of Lawrence and Monroe Counties, Indiana: Their People, Industries, and Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoflawrenc00indi|year=1914|publisher=B.F.

The first county seat of Lawrence County was located at [[Palestine, Lawrence County, Indiana|Palestine]], situated on a high bluff near the [[White River (Indiana)|East Fork of the White River]]. 276 lots were laid out in Palestine, which were advertised for sale on May 25, 1818. Steps were immediately taken to build a courthouse and a jail. The first courthouse of the county was log and erected in the spring of 1818. This courthouse was temporary, and steps to construct a permanent courthouse began in November 1818. It was first designed in octagonal form, with brick walls, a stone foundation, with 45 windows and to be two stories tall. The courthouse was finished in the autumn of 1821, at a total cost of $5,500 (1821 [[United States Dollar|USD]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Lawrence and Monroe Counties, Indiana: Their People, Industries, and Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoflawrenc00indi|year=1914|publisher=B.F.

The name \"[[Bedford, Indiana|Bedford]]\" was selected for the new county seat by Joseph Rawlins, a local businessman, after [[Bedford County, Virginia]]. The town was laid out on March 30, 1825, and current residents of Palestine were offered a lot in Bedford. The county records were hauled from Palestine to Bedford by Richard Evans.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Lawrence and Monroe Counties, Indiana: Their People, Industries, and Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoflawrenc00indi|year=1914|publisher=B.F.

In 1831, the board of commissioners took up the matter of building a more suitable courthouse and adertised bids for a courthouse similar to the one at [[Salem, Indiana|Salem]] in May, and there obtained complete plans of that structure. The old buildings at Palestine were sold, and the proceeds were to be used in the construction of the new building. The building was finished in May 1834. A fourth courthouse was built was built in 1872. The fifth and current courthouse was built in 1930.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Lawrence and Monroe Counties, Indiana: Their People, Industries, and Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoflawrenc00indi|year=1914|publisher=B.F.

Around the same time, [[Flinn Township, Lawrence County, Indiana|Flinn Township]] was created. On January 23, 1826, [[Marion Township, Lawrence County, Indiana|Marion Township]] was created, followed by [[Marshall Township, Lawrence County, Indiana|Marshall Township]] in June 1855. In March 1866, 180 residents petitioned for a new township, called \"Morton\", to be formed out of Shawswick, [[Bono Township, Lawrence County, Indiana|Bono]], and Flinn, but after much thought was named [[Guthrie Township, Lawrence County, Indiana|Guthrie Township]] after an old pioneer family of the county. On January 1, 1911, Flinn Township was annexed by Shawswick, Guthrie, and [[Pleasant Run Township, Lawrence County, Indiana|Pleasant Run]] Townships, after the county commissioners meeting a month prior.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Lawrence and Monroe Counties, Indiana: Their People, Industries, and Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoflawrenc00indi|year=1914|publisher=B.F.

==History==
Until the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]], the general area of Lawrence County was populated primarily by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The first trace of white settlement in Lawrence County was near [[Leesville, Indiana|Leesville]]; however, [[Bono, Lawrence County, Indiana|Bono]] was the first white settlement in the county.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Lawrence County, Indiana|url=http://www.ingenweb.org/inlawrence/history.html|publisher=INGenWeb|access-date=July 26, 2016}}</ref> Lawrence County was formed in 1818 by subdividing Orange County.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Lawrence and Monroe Counties, Indiana: Their People, Industries, and Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoflawrenc00indi|year=1914|publisher=B.F.

Prior to Lawrence County's creation, it was organized as \"Leatherwood Township.\" On March 11, 1818, the county commissioners Ambrose Carlton, Thomas Beagley, and James Stotts, met at the home of James Gregory. On the third day of this session, the commissioners proceeded to divide the county into two civil townships: [[Shawswick Township, Lawrence County, Indiana|Shawswick]] and [[Spice Valley Township, Lawrence County, Indiana|Spice Valley]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lawrence County's Bicentennial|url=https://limestonecountry.com/bicentennial/|publisher=Limestone County|access-date=April 5, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=History of Lawrence and Monroe Counties, Indiana: Their People, Industries, and Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoflawrenc00indi|year=1914|publisher=B.F.

The first county seat of Lawrence County was located at [[Palestine, Lawrence County, Indiana|Palestine]], situated on a high bluff near the [[White River (Indiana)|East Fork of the White River]]. 276 lots were laid out in Palestine, which were advertised for sale on May 25, 1818. Steps were immediately taken to build a courthouse and a jail. The first courthouse of the county was log and erected in the spring of 1818. This courthouse was temporary, and steps to construct a permanent courthouse began in November 1818. It was first designed in octagonal form, with brick walls, a stone foundation, with 45 windows and to be two stories tall. The courthouse was finished in the autumn of 1821, at a total cost of $5,500 (1821 [[United States Dollar|USD]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Lawrence and Monroe Counties, Indiana: Their People, Industries, and Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoflawrenc00indi|year=1914|publisher=B.F.

The name \"[[Bedford, Indiana|Bedford]]\" was selected for the new county seat by Joseph Rawlins, a local businessman, after [[Bedford County, Virginia]]. The town was laid out on March 30, 1825, and current residents of Palestine were offered a lot in Bedford. The county records were hauled from Palestine to Bedford by Richard Evans.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Lawrence and Monroe Counties, Indiana: Their People, Industries, and Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoflawrenc00indi|year=1914|publisher=B.F.

In 1831, the board of commissioners took up the matter of building a more suitable courthouse and adertised bids for a courthouse similar to the one at [[Salem, Indiana|Salem]] in May, and there obtained complete plans of that structure. The old buildings at Palestine were sold, and the proceeds were to be used in the construction of the new building. The building was finished in May 1834. A fourth courthouse was built was built in 1872. The fifth and current courthouse was built in 1930.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Lawrence and Monroe Counties, Indiana: Their People, Industries, and Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoflawrenc00indi|year=1914|publisher=B.F.

Around the same time, [[Flinn Township, Lawrence County, Indiana|Flinn Township]] was created. On January 23, 1826, [[Marion Township, Lawrence County, Indiana|Marion Township]] was created, followed by [[Marshall Township, Lawrence County, Indiana|Marshall Township]] in June 1855. In March 1866, 180 residents petitioned for a new township, called \"Morton\", to be formed out of Shawswick, [[Bono Township, Lawrence County, Indiana|Bono]], and Flinn, but after much thought was named [[Guthrie Township, Lawrence County, Indiana|Guthrie Township]] after an old pioneer family of the county. On January 1, 1911, Flinn Township was annexed by Shawswick, Guthrie, and [[Pleasant Run Township, Lawrence County, Indiana|Pleasant Run]] Townships, after the county commissioners meeting a month prior.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Lawrence and Monroe Counties, Indiana: Their People, Industries, and Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoflawrenc00indi|year=1914|publisher=B.F.

'''''Final Destination 5''''' is a 2011 American [[3D film|3D]] [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[Steven Quale]] and written by [[Eric Heisserer]]. It is the fifth installment in the [[Final Destination|''Final Destination'' film series]]. ''Final Destination 5'' stars [[Nicholas D'Agosto]], [[Emma Bell]], [[Miles Fisher]], [[Arlen Escarpeta]], [[David Koechner]], and [[Tony Todd]].

Despite ''[[The Final Destination]]'' being originally announced as the final film in the franchise, due to its financial success, development of ''Final Destination 5'' began in 2010. Filming took place in [[Vancouver]], as with the first three installments. It was theatrically released in August 12, 2011, and on [[DVD]] on December 27, 2011.

The film received mostly positive reviews; this is the first film in the franchise to do so. Critics praised the plot, CGI, death scenes and tone, especially in comparison to the previous installment. The film was a financial success and is the second highest-grossing film in the franchise.

==Plot==
Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it actually does collapse, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \"Death doesn't like to be cheated\", and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense.

Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below, popping her eyeball out of its socket, causing it to roll away. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next.

Meanwhile, Nathan, who has returned to the factory, accidentally kills his co-worker, Roy Carson, during an argument by pushing him in front of a lifting hook, which impales him through the chin. As Nathan informs the remaining survivors about this, they realize he claimed Roy's remaining lifespan by killing him and therefore must be safe. When Dennis arrives to question Nathan about the incident, a wrench launched by a belt sander hits him in the face, killing him.

That evening, after working at a restaurant, Sam asks his supervisor to reserve the restaurant for a date with Molly. Peter, who has become unstable after Candice's death, interrupts the date and tells them that he will kill Molly to take her lifespan. After Peter draws a gun, Sam and Molly both escape to the kitchen. Agent Block overhears the gunshots from outside. When he enters the restaurant, he is shot dead by Peter. Believing that he is safe from Death, Peter decides to kill both Molly and Sam to remove any witnesses. The two men fight and Peter knocks Sam unconscious. Just as Peter is about to stab Molly with a kitchen knife, Sam awakens and stabs him in the back with a large skewer, leading Sam to believe that he claimed Block's life.

Two weeks later, Sam and Molly board a plane to Paris. As they take their seats, they notice [[Final Destination (film)|a couple passengers being removed from the plane]] with one of them, [[Alex Browning]], warning the other passengers still in the plane to get off. This reveals that the plane they are on is Volée Airlines  [[Boeing 747]] Flight 180 from [[Final Destination (film)|the first film]]. Sam and Molly are confused but take their seats nonetheless. When the lights dim for take off, Sam looks at his plane ticket, dated May 13, 2000, revealing that the previous events took place in April. Upon takeoff, Sam gets the same signs that he got on the bridge collapse and overhears from an airhostess telling another passenger that Alex had a vision of the plane's destruction and realizes it is too late for him to leave, and both he and Molly perish in the explosion that follows. At Roy's memorial, Nathan learns that Roy had a [[Intracranial aneurysm|brain aneurysm]] that was close to bursting, and was due to die \"any day now.\" As Nathan realizes he is still in danger, the landing gear from the plane breaks through the roof and crushes Nathan, setting off the events of the [[Final Destination|first four films]].

===Writing===
According to Heisserer, ''Final Destination 5'' was always meant to be a [[prequel]], set before the first film; the idea having come from franchise producer Craig Perry. Heisserer said that one major problem he encountered while writing the film was coming up with good death sequences, believing that managing to do so in the world of ''Final Destination'' is \"ridiculously hard\".

===Marketing===
The [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) in the UK ruled that the original theatrical poster, which had been used on buses and trains during the summer, \"was likely to cause fear and undue distress to children\". It ruled that the advert must not appear in the original form again.

Warner Bros. countered by stating that the poster \"accurately reflected the content of the film in an appropriate manner without causing excessive fear or distress\". They also added that the poster's dark grey and black colors were \"unlikely to engage the attention of young children\", and that the \"surreal\" image did not feature people, blood or display any real-life violence.

The ASA, which had received 13 complaints, with three stating that their children (aged between 1 and 3) had been upset, ruled \"We considered the image was likely to catch the attention of children, especially because it was shown on a poster on the Underground, where it was an untargeted medium. Because very young children might view this ad depicting violence, it was likely to cause fear and undue distress to children.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16065584 | work=BBC News | title=Final Destination 5 poster banned by ASA | date=2011-12-07}}</ref>

'''''Final Destination 5''''' is a 2011 American [[3D film|3D]] [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[Steven Quale]] and written by [[Eric Heisserer]]. It is the fifth installment in the [[Final Destination|''Final Destination'' film series]]. ''Final Destination 5'' stars [[Nicholas D'Agosto]], [[Emma Bell]], [[Miles Fisher]], [[Arlen Escarpeta]], [[David Koechner]], and [[Tony Todd]].

Despite ''[[The Final Destination]]'' being originally announced as the final film in the franchise, due to its financial success, development of ''Final Destination 5'' began in 2010. Filming took place in [[Vancouver]], as with the first three installments. It was theatrically released in August 12, 2011, and on [[DVD]] on December 27, 2011.

The film received mostly positive reviews; this is the first film in the franchise to do so. Critics praised the plot, CGI, death scenes and tone, especially in comparison to the previous installment. The film was a financial success and is the second highest-grossing film in the franchise.

==Plot==
Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it actually does collapse, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \"Death doesn't like to be cheated\", and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense.

Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below, popping her eyeball out of its socket, causing it to roll away. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next.

Meanwhile, Nathan, who has returned to the factory, accidentally kills his co-worker, Roy Carson, during an argument by pushing him in front of a lifting hook, which impales him through the chin. As Nathan informs the remaining survivors about this, they realize he claimed Roy's remaining lifespan by killing him and therefore must be safe. When Dennis arrives to question Nathan about the incident, a wrench launched by a belt sander hits him in the face, killing him.

That evening, after working at a restaurant, Sam asks his supervisor to reserve the restaurant for a date with Molly. Peter, who has become unstable after Candice's death, interrupts the date and tells them that he will kill Molly to take her lifespan. After Peter draws a gun, Sam and Molly both escape to the kitchen. Agent Block overhears the gunshots from outside. When he enters the restaurant, he is shot dead by Peter. Believing that he is safe from Death, Peter decides to kill both Molly and Sam to remove any witnesses. The two men fight and Peter knocks Sam unconscious. Just as Peter is about to stab Molly with a kitchen knife, Sam awakens and stabs him in the back with a large skewer, leading Sam to believe that he claimed Block's life.

Two weeks later, Sam and Molly board a plane to Paris. As they take their seats, they notice [[Final Destination (film)|a couple passengers being removed from the plane]] with one of them, [[Alex Browning]], warning the other passengers still in the plane to get off. This reveals that the plane they are on is Volée Airlines  [[Boeing 747]] Flight 180 from [[Final Destination (film)|the first film]]. Sam and Molly are confused but take their seats nonetheless. When the lights dim for take off, Sam looks at his plane ticket, dated May 13, 2000, revealing that the previous events took place in April. Upon takeoff, Sam gets the same signs that he got on the bridge collapse and overhears from an airhostess telling another passenger that Alex had a vision of the plane's destruction and realizes it is too late for him to leave, and both he and Molly perish in the explosion that follows. At Roy's memorial, Nathan learns that Roy had a [[Intracranial aneurysm|brain aneurysm]] that was close to bursting, and was due to die \"any day now.\" As Nathan realizes he is still in danger, the landing gear from the plane breaks through the roof and crushes Nathan, setting off the events of the [[Final Destination|first four films]].

===Writing===
According to Heisserer, ''Final Destination 5'' was always meant to be a [[prequel]], set before the first film; the idea having come from franchise producer Craig Perry. Heisserer said that one major problem he encountered while writing the film was coming up with good death sequences, believing that managing to do so in the world of ''Final Destination'' is \"ridiculously hard\". The inspiration for Olivia's death sequence involving [[LASIK]] [[eye surgery]] after his wife underwent the same type of surgery.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thurman|first1=Trace|title=Taking the Blame: An Interview With Screenwriter Eric Heisserer!|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3397692/eric-heisserer-interview/|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=29 May 2017|date=20 July 2016}}</ref>

The [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) in the UK ruled that the original theatrical poster, which had been used on buses and trains during the summer, \"was likely to cause fear and undue distress to children\". It ruled that the advert must not appear in the original form again.

Warner Bros. countered by stating that the poster \"accurately reflected the content of the film in an appropriate manner without causing excessive fear or distress\". They also added that the poster's dark grey and black colors were \"unlikely to engage the attention of young children\", and that the \"surreal\" image did not feature people, blood or display any real-life violence.

The ASA, which had received 13 complaints, with three stating that their children (aged between 1 and 3) had been upset, ruled \"We considered the image was likely to catch the attention of children, especially because it was shown on a poster on the Underground, where it was an untargeted medium. Because very young children might view this ad depicting violence, it was likely to cause fear and undue distress to children.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16065584 | work=BBC News | title=Final Destination 5 poster banned by ASA | date=2011-12-07}}</ref>

''Final Destination 5'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] Disc on December 27, 2011. The Blu-ray Disc comes in two forms: the movie only edition and the Blu-ray Disc/DVD/[[UltraViolet (system)|UltraViolet]] edition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Final Destination 5 DVD, Blu-ray Details|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=21417}}</ref> A [[Blu-ray#Blu-ray 3D|Blu-ray 3D]] edition was released exclusively through [[Best Buy]].

Before the film appeared in theaters, Fisher released a music video. Starring the main cast of ''Final Destination 5'' and featuring Fisher's original song \"New Romance\", the video parodied the 1990s sitcom ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'' and included a clue to the plot of the film. Fisher, a fan of the show, and video director Dave Green watched every episode, and contemporary shows like ''[[Boy Meets World]]'' and ''[[Clarissa Explains It All]]''. \"We thought, 'Gosh wouldn't it be fun and subversive to have Final Destination-type deaths in this safe, [sitcom] world?'\" Fisher, who plays a [[List of Saved by the Bell characters#Zack Morris|Zack Morris]]-type character, said. He joked, \"I basically have always been looking for a way to dance with [[List of Saved by the Bell characters#Kelly Kapowski|Kelly Kapowski]] my whole life\".<ref name=\"semigran20110810\">{{cite news | url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/08/10/final-destination-5-star-miles-fisher/ | title='Final Destination 5' star Miles Fisher talks viral 'Saved by the Bell' spoof | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=2011-08-10 | accessdate=12 April 2014 | author=Semigran, Aly}}</ref>

By the start of 1972, at the age of 21, he was second-in-command of the IRA in [[Derry]], a position he held at the time of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]], when 14 civil rights protesters were killed in the city by British soldiers of the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1308899.stm|title=BBC News – NORTHERN IRELAND – McGuinness confirms IRA role|website=New.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2017-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/widgery.htm|title=CAIN: [Widgery Report] Report of the Tribunal appointed to inquire into events on Sunday, 30 January 1972|work=ulst.ac.uk}}</ref>

During the [[Saville Inquiry]] into the events of that day, Paddy Ward stated he had been the leader of the [[Fianna Éireann|Fianna]], the youth wing of the IRA at the time of Bloody Sunday. He said that McGuinness and an anonymous IRA member gave him bomb parts that morning. He said that his organisation intended to attack city centre premises in Derry on the same day.

The inquiry concluded that, although McGuinness was \"engaged in paramilitary activity\" at the time of Bloody Sunday and had probably been armed with a [[Thompson submachine gun]], there was insufficient evidence to make any finding other than they were \"sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire\".<ref name=SavilleMcGuinness3119>{{cite web|url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003/#the-report|title=Report of The Bloody Sunday Inquiry – Volume I – Chapter 3|publisher=Bloody Sunday Inquiry|date=15 June 2010|accessdate=15 June 2010|quote=3.119 in the course of investigating the activities of the Provisional and Official IRA on the day, we considered at some length allegations that Martin McGuinness, at that time the Adjutant of the Derry Brigade or Command of the Provisional IRA, had engaged in paramilitary activity during the day.

Before the soldiers of Support Company went into the Bogside he was probably armed with a Thompson sub-machine gun, and though it is possible that he fired this weapon, there is insufficient evidence to make any finding on this, save that we are sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824013430/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003|archivedate=24 August 2010}}</ref>

McGuinness negotiated alongside [[Gerry Adams]] with the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], [[William Whitelaw|Willie Whitelaw]], in 1972. In 1973, he was convicted by the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s [[Special Criminal Court]], after being arrested near a car containing {{convert|250|lb|kg}} of explosives and nearly 5,000 rounds of ammunition. He refused to recognise the court, and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. In court, he declared his membership of the Provisional IRA without equivocation: \"We have fought against the killing of our people...

After his release, and another conviction in the Republic of Ireland for IRA membership,{{when|date=July 2019}} he became increasingly prominent in Sinn Féin, the political wing of the [[Republican movement (Ireland)|republican movement]].

In August 1993, he was the subject of a two-part special by ''[[The Cook Report]]'', a [[ITV Central|Central TV]] investigative documentary series presented by [[Roger Cook (journalist)|Roger Cook]]. It accused him of continuing involvement in IRA activity, of attending an interrogation and of encouraging Frank Hegarty, an informer, to return to Derry from a safe house in England. Hegarty's mother Rose appeared on the programme to tell of telephone calls to McGuinness and of Hegarty's subsequent murder.

== Provisional IRA activity ==
McGuinness acknowledged that he was a former IRA member, but stated that he left the IRA in 1974.<ref>Henry McDonald [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/12/ira-relative-martin-mcguinness-blood IRA victim's brother says Martin McGuinness has blood on his hands] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 12 October 2011</ref> He originally joined the [[Official IRA]], unaware of the split at the December 1969 Army Convention, switching to the [[Provisional IRA]] soon after. By the start of 1972, at the age of 21, he was second-in-command of the IRA in [[Derry]], a position he held at the time of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]], when 14 civil rights protesters were killed in the city by British soldiers of the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1308899.stm|title=BBC News – NORTHERN IRELAND – McGuinness confirms IRA role|website=New.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2017-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/widgery.htm|title=CAIN: [Widgery Report] Report of the Tribunal appointed to inquire into events on Sunday, 30 January 1972|work=ulst.ac.uk}}</ref>

During the [[Saville Inquiry]] into the events of that day, Paddy Ward stated he had been the leader of the [[Fianna Éireann|Fianna]], the youth wing of the IRA at the time of Bloody Sunday. He said that McGuinness and an anonymous IRA member gave him bomb parts that morning. He said that his organisation intended to attack city centre premises in Derry on the same day. In response, McGuinness said the statements were \"fantasy\", while Gearóid Ó hEára (formerly Gerry O'Hara), a Derry [[Sinn Féin]] councillor, stated that he and not Ward was the Fianna leader at the time.<ref>John Innes, [http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=628&id=1161662003 \"McGuinness is named as bomb runner\"], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 21 October 2003.</ref>

The inquiry concluded that, although McGuinness was \"engaged in paramilitary activity\" at the time of Bloody Sunday and had probably been armed with a [[Thompson submachine gun]], there was insufficient evidence to make any finding other than they were \"sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire\".<ref name=SavilleMcGuinness3119>{{cite web|url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003/#the-report|title=Report of The Bloody Sunday Inquiry – Volume I – Chapter 3|publisher=Bloody Sunday Inquiry|date=15 June 2010|accessdate=15 June 2010|quote=3.119 in the course of investigating the activities of the Provisional and Official IRA on the day, we considered at some length allegations that Martin McGuinness, at that time the Adjutant of the Derry Brigade or Command of the Provisional IRA, had engaged in paramilitary activity during the day. In the end we were left in some doubt as to his movements on the day. Before the soldiers of Support Company went into the Bogside he was probably armed with a Thompson sub-machine gun, and though it is possible that he fired this weapon, there is insufficient evidence to make any finding on this, save that we are sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824013430/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003|archivedate=24 August 2010}}</ref>

McGuinness negotiated alongside [[Gerry Adams]] with the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], [[William Whitelaw|Willie Whitelaw]], in 1972. In 1973, he was convicted by the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s [[Special Criminal Court]], after being arrested near a car containing {{convert|250|lb|kg}} of explosives and nearly 5,000 rounds of ammunition. He refused to recognise the court, and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. In court, he declared his membership of the Provisional IRA without equivocation: \"We have fought against the killing of our people... I am a member of [[Óglaigh na hÉireann]] and very, very proud of it\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Taylor (Journalist)|title=Provos The IRA & Sinn Féin|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|year=1997|pages=152–53|isbn=0-7475-3818-2}}</ref>

After his release, and another conviction in the Republic of Ireland for IRA membership,{{when|date=July 2019}} he became increasingly prominent in Sinn Féin, the political wing of the [[Republican movement (Ireland)|republican movement]]. He was in indirect contact with British intelligence during the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|1981 hunger strikes]], and again in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinnfein.ie/contents/15216 |title=Setting the Record Straight &#124; Sinn Féin |website=Sinnfein.ie |date= |accessdate=2017-05-04}}</ref> He was elected to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly (1982)|Northern Ireland Assembly]] at [[Parliament Building of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] in 1982, representing [[Londonderry (Assembly constituency)|Londonderry]]. He was the second candidate elected after [[John Hume]]. As with all elected members of Sinn Féin and the SDLP, he did not take up his seat.<ref>''Martin McGuinness: From Guns to Government'' by Liam Clarke and Kathryn Johnston ({{ISBN|1-84018-725-5}}), pages 152–153</ref> On 9 December 1982, McGuinness, Gerry Adams and [[Danny Morrison (writer)|Danny Morrison]] were banned from entering Great Britain under the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act (Northern Ireland)|Prevention of Terrorism Act]] by the [[Home Secretary]], William Whitelaw.<ref>''Martin McGuinness: From Guns to Government'' by Liam Clarke and Kathryn Johnston ({{ISBN|1-84018-725-5}}), page 155</ref>

In August 1993, he was the subject of a two-part special by ''[[The Cook Report]]'', a [[ITV Central|Central TV]] investigative documentary series presented by [[Roger Cook (journalist)|Roger Cook]]. It accused him of continuing involvement in IRA activity, of attending an interrogation and of encouraging Frank Hegarty, an informer, to return to Derry from a safe house in England. Hegarty's mother Rose appeared on the programme to tell of telephone calls to McGuinness and of Hegarty's subsequent murder. McGuinness denied her account and denounced the programme saying \"I have never been in the IRA. I don't have any sway over the IRA\".<ref>''Martin McGuinness: From Guns to Government'' by Liam Clarke and Kathryn Johnston ({{ISBN|1-84018-725-5}}), page 222</ref>

In 2005, [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]], the Irish [[Tánaiste]], stated McGuinness, along with Gerry Adams and [[Martin Ferris]], were members of the seven-man [[IRA Army Council]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1483997/Adams-and-McGuinness-named-as-IRA-leaders.html |title=Adams and McGuinness named as IRA leaders |first=Thomas |last=Harding |date=21 February 2005 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=9 May 2012 |location=London}}</ref> McGuinness denied this, saying he was no longer an IRA member. Experienced [[The Troubles|Troubles]] journalist [[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Peter Taylor]] presented further apparent evidence of McGuinness's role in the IRA in his documentary ''Age of Terror'', shown in April 2008.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7356159.stm Age of Terror], [[BBC News]], 21 April 2008</ref> In his documentary, Taylor alleges that McGuinness was the head of the [[IRA's Northern Command]] and had advance knowledge of the IRA's 1987 [[Remembrance Day bombing|Enniskillen bombing]], which left 11 civilians dead.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7356159.stm|title=BBC NEWS – UK – Who knew about Enniskillen plans?|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2017-05-04}}</ref>

== Chief negotiator and Minister of Education ==
He became Sinn Féin's chief negotiator in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]] negotiations which led to the [[Good Friday Agreement]].  At the time of his death, former US President Bill Clinton noted that McGuinness was the one who personally oversaw the Agreement's arms decommissioning phase.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clintonfoundation.org/press-releases/statement-president-clinton-passing-martin-mcguinness|title=Statement from President Clinton on the Passing of Martin McGuinness|website=Clintonfoundation.org|accessdate=2017-05-04}}</ref>  Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair also acknowledged the leading role which McGuinness had in ensuring the Agreement would be enforced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.derrynow.com/news/tony-blair-martin-mcguinness-good-friday-agreement-never-achieved-without-martins-leadership-courage/151921|title=Tony Blair on Martin McGuinness - Good Friday Agreement could never have been achieved 'without Martin's leadership and courage'|website=Derrynow.com|accessdate=2017-05-04}}</ref>

He was elected to the [[Northern Ireland Forum]] in 1996 representing [[Foyle (Assembly constituency)|Foyle]]. Having contested Foyle unsuccessfully at the 1983, 1987 and 1992 Westminster elections,<ref>{{cite web|title=Election Data 1987|url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_1987.txt|publisher=[[Electoral Calculus]]|accessdate=18 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015054243/http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_1987.txt|archivedate=15 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Election Data 1983|url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_1983.txt|publisher=[[Electoral Calculus]]|accessdate=18 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015054231/http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_1983.txt|archivedate=15 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Election Data 1992|url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_1992ob.txt|publisher=[[Electoral Calculus]]|accessdate=18 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015054418/http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_1992ob.txt|archivedate=15 October 2011}}</ref> he became MP for [[Mid Ulster (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Ulster]] in 1997 and after the Agreement was concluded, was returned as a member of the Assembly for the [[Mid Ulster (Assembly constituency)|same constituency]]. He was nominated by his party for a ministerial position in the power-sharing [[Northern Ireland Executive|executive]], where he became Minister of Education. One of his controversial acts as Minister of Education was his decision to scrap the [[Eleven plus exam|11-plus exam]], which he had failed as a child.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/549635.stm. McGuinness: Let's work together] BBC News, 4 December 1999</ref> He was re-elected to the Westminster Parliament in 2001, 2005 and 2010.

In May 2003, transcripts of telephone calls between McGuinness and British officials including [[Mo Mowlam]], the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and [[Jonathan Powell (Labour adviser)|Jonathan Powell]], [[Tony Blair]]'s Chief of Staff, were published in a biography of McGuinness entitled ''From Guns to Government'' by Kathryn Johnston and Liam Clarke. The tapes had been made by [[MI5]] and the authors of the book were arrested under the [[Official Secrets Act]]. The conversations showed an easy and friendly relationship between McGuinness and Powell. He joked with Powell about [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] MPs while Mowlam referred to him as \"babe\" and discussed her difficulties with Blair. In another transcript, he praised [[Bill Clinton]] to Gerry Adams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/mcguinness-taps.htm |title=Martin McGuinness Wiretap Transcripts |publisher=Cryptome.org |accessdate=28 September 2011}}</ref>

In the weeks following the [[St Andrews Agreement]], the four biggest parties—the DUP, Sinn Féin, the UUP and the SDLP—indicated their choice of ministries in the Executive and nominated members to fill them. The Assembly convened on 8 May 2007 and Paisley and McGuinness were nominated as First Minister and deputy First Minister respectively. On 12 May Sinn Féin agreed to take up three places on the [[Northern Ireland Policing Board]], and nominated three MLAs to take them.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilford|first1=Rick|last2=Wilson|first2=Robin|title=Devolution Monitoring Programme 2006–08|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/research/research-archive/ni07.pdf|publisher=Queens University Belfast|accessdate=21 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Lansford|first1=Tom|title=Political Handbook of the World 2012|year=2012|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-6087-1995-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/politicalhandboo0000unse_a2s3/page/1138 1138–1139]|url=https://archive.org/details/politicalhandboo0000unse_a2s3/page/1138}}</ref>

On 8 December 2007, while visiting President of the United States [[George W.

The works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] have served as the inspiration to
painters, musicians, film-makers and writers, to such an extent that Tolkien is sometimes seen as the \"father\" of the entire genre of [[high fantasy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8119893978710705002 |title=J. R. R. Tolkien: Father of Modern Fantasy Literature |accessdate=20 July 2006 |author=Mitchell, Christopher |format=Google Video |work=\"Let There Be Light\" series |publisher=[[University of California Television]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060728041138/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8119893978710705002 |archivedate=28 July 2006 }}.</ref> The production of such derivative works is sometimes of doubtful legality, because Tolkien's published works will remain in copyright until 2043. The film, stage and merchandise rights of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' are owned by [[Middle-earth Enterprises]], while the rights of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and other material remain with [[Tolkien Estate|The J.R.R.

{{Quote|Do not laugh! But once upon a time (my crest has long since fallen) I had a mind to make a body of more or less connected legend, ranging from the large and cosmogonic to the level of romantic fairy-story... The cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama. Absurd.|J. R. R. Tolkien<ref>Qtd. in Humphrey Carpenter, ''J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography'' (London: Allen and Unwin, 1977), 89-90.</ref>}}

==Art and illustration==
The earliest illustrations of Tolkien's works were drawn by the author himself. In 1937, ''The Hobbit'' was first illustrated by professional draughtsmen for the American edition. Tolkien was very critical of these, and in 1946 he rejected illustrations by [[Horus Engels]] for the German edition of the ''Hobbit'' as \"too '[[The Walt Disney Company|Disnified]]'\".<ref>7 December 1946, ''The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien: A Selection'', ed. Humphrey Carpenter, with the assistance of Christopher Tolkien (London: Allen and Unwin, 1981), no. 107</ref>

In 1948, [[Milein Cosman]] was invited by Tolkien's publishers to submit illustrations for ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''. 
Tolkien felt her impressionistic style did not suit the story, and she was replaced by [[Pauline Baynes]], who later also supplied the illustrations for ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' (1962) and ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'' (1967). In 1968, Tolkien was sent a number of a suite of illustrations of ''The Lord of the Rings'', mostly in coloured ink, by English artist [[Mary Fairburn]]; Tolkien said of her pictures: \"They ... show far more attention to the text than any that have yet been submitted to me.... I am beginning to ... think that an illustrated edition might be a good thing.\" For various reasons the project went no further, and Fairburn's illustrations were unknown until 2012.<ref>Tankard, Paul, \"An Unknown Vision of Middle-earth: Mary Fairburn: Tolkien Illustrator\", ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', 14 September 2012. http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1124297.ece</ref> Crown Princess Margrethe (now [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]]) of Denmark, an accomplished and critically acclaimed painter, was inspired to illustrations to ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the early 1970s. She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity to the style of his own drawings.{{citation needed<!--ME-fact-->|date=October 2007}} In 1977, Queen Margrethe's drawings were published in the Danish translation of the book, which was reissued in 2002,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/profiles/queenmargrethe/| title=Queen Margrethe II of Denmark|work =Hello Magazine|accessdate=29 May 2006}}</ref> redrawn by the British artist [[Eric Fraser (illustrator)|Eric Fraser]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Lord of the Rings|last=Tolkien|first=J. R. R.|publisher=The Folio Society|year=1977|location=London|pages=title page}}</ref> These images were also included in the English edition of 1977 by the [[Folio Society]].

[[The Brothers Hildebrandt|Tim and Greg Hildebrandt]] were also well-known Tolkien illustrators during the first decades after the publication of ''The Lord of the Rings''.

In the 1970s, British artist [[Jimmy Cauty]] created a best-selling poster of [[The Lord of the Rings]] (1976) and The [[Hobbit]] (1980) for the retailer [[Athena (retailer)|Athena]].<ref>Spencer, Neil, \"A guerrilla raid on the arts establishment\", ''[[The Guardian]]'' ([[Manchester]]) {{ISSN|0261-3077}} , 31 October 1993, ''The Observer Review Page''.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://klf.de/home/jimmy-cauty-solo-projects/athena-posters/|title=Jimmy Cauty's Athena Posters|website=KLF ONLINE|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-19}}</ref>

Probably the widest-known Tolkien illustrators of the 1990s and 2000s are [[John Howe (illustrator)|John Howe]], [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], and [[Ted Nasmith]] — Alan Lee for illustrated editions of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', Ted Nasmith for illustrated editions of ''The Silmarillion'', and John Howe for the cover artwork to several Tolkien publications. Howe and Lee were also involved in the creation of [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|film trilogy]] as concept artists – Nasmith was also invited to take part in the films, but was forced to reluctantly decline due to a personal crisis at the time. In 2004, Lee won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction for his work on the film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/76academyawards/nomswins.html| title=76th Academy Awards|work =Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=29 May 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060219061720/http://www.oscars.org/76academyawards/nomswins.html |archivedate = 19 February 2006}}</ref>

Other artists who have found inspiration in Tolkien's works include Catherine Karina Chmiel, [[Inger Edelfeldt]], [[Anke Eißmann]], [[Roger Garland (artist)|Roger Garland]], [[Michael Hague]], [[Tove Jansson]] (of [[Moomin]] fame, illustrator of Swedish and Finnish translations of ''[[The Hobbit]]''), Jay Johnstone, [[Paul R Gregory|Paul Raymond Gregory]], [[Tim Kirk]], [[Angus McBride]], [[Jef Murray]], [[Kay Miner]], [[Billy Mosig]], [[Colleen Doran]], [[Jenny Dolfen]], [[Matěj Čadil]] and [[Peter Xavier Price]].

==Film==
[[File:Hobbiton.jpg|thumb|New Zealand's \"[[Hobbiton]]\" where ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy was filmed.]]
[[File:Sir Peter Jackson.jpg|thumb|Peter Jackson, director of six Tolkien adaptations, at the site of filming of ''The Hobbit'' trilogy.]]
{{Main|Middle-earth in film}}
Tolkien originally sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' to [[United Artists]] in 1968, but they never made a film, and in 1976 the rights were sold to [[Tolkien Enterprises]], a division of the [[Saul Zaentz]] Company.

In the early seventies [[John Boorman]] was planning a film of ''The Lord of the Rings'', but the plans never went further because of movie studio politics. Some of the work done was resurrected for the film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' in 1981.

[[Ralph Bakshi]] directed an animated movie adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' in 1978 (partly made with the [[rotoscope]] technique), which covered only the first half of ''The Lord of the Rings''. [[Rankin-Bass]] covered the second half with a children's TV animation ''[[The Return of the King (1980 movie)|The Return of the King]]'' (1980); earlier they had made a TV animation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' (1977).

''The Lord of the Rings'' was adapted as a [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|trilogy of films]] (2001–03), directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. ''The Hobbit'' was also adapted as a [[The Hobbit (film series)|trilogy]] (2012–14), with some elements adapted from ''The Return of the King'''s Appendices, resulting in noticeable divergences with the novel.

The split of Tolkien's works between [[Tolkien Enterprises]] and the [[Tolkien Estate]] means that none of the Tolkien Enterprises' products can include source material from outside ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', and therefore a film or stage version of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' is highly unlikely.

[[Babylon 5#Influences|Comparisons]] have been made to the plot of the [[science fiction]] [[television show]] ''[[Babylon 5]]'' and Tolkien's works.

==Games==
There are multiple model-based games, trading card games, board games and [[video game]]s that take place in Middle-earth, most depicting scenes and characters from ''The Lord of the Rings.''  In a broader sense, many fantasy [[role-playing games]] such as ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' and ''[[DragonQuest]]'' were strongly influenced by Tolkien's works. Such games feature creatures such as Orcs, Trolls, Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Ents which are common to Tolkien's mythos even if they do not take place in Middle-earth.

===Video games===
{{Main|Middle-earth in video games}}
The books have been reproduced in video game form a number of times during the 1980s and 2000s, including [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]]'s ''Lord of the Rings'', ''Shadows of Mordor'', ''[[War in Middle-earth]]''; [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]]'s ''Lord of the Rings Vol. 1'' and ''Lord of the Rings Vol. 2.''; [[Electronic Arts]]' action [[platformer]] adaptations of ''The Two Towers'' and ''The Return of the King'', [[real-time strategy game]]s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', and the [[role-playing game]] ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]],'' all based on the Jackson films; and [[Sierra Entertainment]]'s action platformer based on ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. There is also a [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] Game titled ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tactics]]'' based on the Jackson films, a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] by [[Turbine Inc|Turbine]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online|The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]''. [[The Two Towers (MUD)]] is also set in Tolkien's world. [[Lego]]'s licensed theme game version had Japanese anime graphics.

===Other games===
[[Games Workshop]] have made a [[miniature wargame]] called ''[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]]'', which, while part of the film trilogy's merchandise, combines elements from both the books and films. Many of Games Workshop's other battle games that are not directly related to the books have had some key background based on it.

Several other games have been based directly on ''The Lord of the Rings'' and related works, including, amongst many, [[Iron Crown Enterprises]]' ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'' game (1982–1999) and ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'' (1995–1999), as well as ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'' ([[2001 in games|2001]]) made by [[Decipher, Inc.]] All of these predate Jackson's film trilogy except for Decipher's card game, which is part of the latter's merchandise.

Decipher also created the ''[[Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]'', a role-playing game based on the Jackson films.

Board games include ''[[Risk: Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition]]'' and another simply entitled ''[[Lord of the Rings (board game)|Lord of the Rings]]'', as well as the ''Middle Earth Games'' from [[Simulations Publications, Inc.]]  containing the games ''War of the Ring'' (strategic, covering all three books), ''Gondor'' (tactical, covering the siege of Minas Tirith) and ''Sauron'' (covering the decisive battle of the Second Age) in [[1977 in games|1977]]. A more recent strategic game covering all three books, called ''[[War of the Ring (board game)|War of the Ring]]'', was released in [[2004 in games|2004]]. There are also ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'' and ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' editions based on ''The Lord of the Rings'', as well as a ''The Lord of the Rings Trivia Game'' quiz game. Chess sets have also been created with the figures based on people and other characters from ''The Lord of the Rings''. there has also been a game on the Nintendo WII. It was \"The Lord of the Rings, Aragorn's Quest\" which is a third person game based on Aragon's role in the book.

===Homages===
{{original research|section|date=September 2010}}
The creators of the ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]] were also strongly influenced by Tolkien. The game has (clearly Tolkien-influenced) dwarves and elves as playable characters, and formerly had hobbits as well. After being threatened with a lawsuit by the [[Saul Zaentz]] company, [[Tolkien Enterprises]], they replaced hobbits with the similar \"halflings\" — a term also used in ''The Lord of the Rings'', balrogs with 'balor-demons' and other genericized names. In most versions of the game, halflings were especially good at being thieves/rogues, a nod to Bilbo the thief in ''The Hobbit''. His works also indirectly inspired the [[Warcraft]] series via their use in [[Games Workshop]]'s battle games.

Equally common is the use of the term [[orc]] for a variety of hobgoblin type creatures in later fantasy although Tolkien popularized this modern usage of the word. Even more removed genre games such as ''[[Shadowrun]]'' and ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' use the term, therein spelt Ork, possibly to sidestep possible legal issues (though Tolkien actually preferred ''-k'' in late writings).

==Literature==

===Prose===
[[File:Lucca Comics 2010 - Terry Brooks 03.jpg|thumb|Fantasy writer Terry Brooks, among others, was heavily influenced by Tolkien]]
Many authors have found inspiration in Tolkien's work as well.

Throughout the next two decades, the term \"[[fantasy]]\" became synonymous with the general aspects of Tolkien's work: multiple races including dwarves and elves, a quest to destroy a magical artifact, and an evil that seeks to control the world. The plot of Novelist [[Pat Murphy (writer)|Pat Murphy]]'s ''[[There and Back Again (novel)|There and Back Again]]'' intentionally mirrors that of ''The Hobbit'', but is transposed into a science-fiction setting involving space travel. [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' has been seen as having been influenced by Tolkien's work, particularly the wizard [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] being partially inspired by Tolkien's Gandalf.<ref>Louise Wetherill, ''Ampthill Literary Festival Yearbook 2015.''

Some people have gone so far as to accuse Paolini of plagiarism.<ref>[http://aydee.wordpress.com/2006/12/17/eragon/ Eragon – Plagiarism Made Popular]</ref> S.M. Stirling's [[The Emberverse series|\"Emberverse\"]] series includes a character obsessed with ''The Lord of the Rings'' who creates a post-apocalyptic community based upon the Elves and Dúnedain of Middle-earth. The same plot point was used by the Russian writer [[Vladimir Berezin (writer)|Vladimir Berezin]] in his novel ''Road Signs'' (from the [[Universe of Metro 2033]]). Another Russian writer, [[Kirill Eskov]], wrote ''[[The Last Ringbearer]]'', about the events in ''Lord of the Rings'' from the perspective of Sauron. [[Stephen King]], best known for horror novels, has acknowledged Tolkien's influence on his novel ''[[The Stand]]'' as well as his fantasy series ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]''. Several other prominent fantasy writers, including [[George R. R. Martin]], [[Michael Swanwick]], [[Raymond E. Feist]], [[Poul Anderson]], [[Karen Haber]], [[Harry Turtledove]], [[Charles De Lint]], and [[Orson Scott Card]], have all acknowledged Tolkien's work as an inspiration for their own fantasy work.<ref name=\"ts\" />

===Poetry===
Some people were inspired to compose poems in [[Quenya]] or [[Sindarin]], the two most developed of Tolkien's created languages. For example, [[Helge Kåre Fauskanger]] translated the first two chapters of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] into Quenya. ''[[Tyalië Tyelelliéva]]'' is a journal dedicated to poems in the Elvish languages.

===Comics===
Cartoonist [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]] was influenced by Tolkien, and the mythologies that inspired his works. His epic 1,300-page graphic novel, ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]'' has been characterized by him as \"[[Bugs Bunny]] meets ''The Lord of the Rings''. It's a really long fairy tale with some fantasy elements but a lot of comedy.\"<ref name=TheCartoonist>{{cite AV media|people = Ken Mills (Director) |title =[[The Cartoonist: Jeff Smith, BONE and the Changing Face of Comics]]|medium = Documentary|publisher = Mills James Productions|date = 21 July 2009}}</ref>

==Radio plays==
{{Main|Adaptations of The Lord of the Rings}}

Three [[radio plays]] based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' have been made, broadcast in 1955–1956, 1979 and 1981 respectively. The first and last ones were produced by the [[BBC]].

==Music==
Numerous songs and other musical works, in a wide range of idioms, have been inspired by or refer to the fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien.

===Rock and heavy metal music===
[[File:Hansi Kursch.jpg|thumb|[[Hansi Kürsch]], the [[Blind Guardian]] vocalist and lyrics writer, composed many songs about Middle Earth]]
<!--Please do NOT describe every song trivia in detail. It is enough to add a band to the list -->

[[Ensio Kosta]] composed in 1980–1982 a chamber music series called \"Music of Middle-earth\",
with movements like \"Awakening of Shire\", \"Incantation\", \"Winding Paths\", \"Lament of Galadriel\", \"Riders of Rohan\", and \"Grey Havens\".

[[Johan de Meij]]'s [[Symphony No. 1 \"The Lord of the Rings\"|Symphony No. 1, \"The Lord of the Rings\"]], for concert band, is in five movements, each illustrating a personage or an important episode from the novel: Gandalf, Lothlorien, Gollum, Journey in the Dark (The Mines of Moria /The Bridge of Khazad-Dum), and Hobbits. The symphony was written between March 1984 and December 1987, and was premièred in Brussels on 15 March 1988. It has been recorded four times, including in an orchestral version, orchestrated by [[Henk de Vlieger]].

Jacqueline Clarke's setting ''Tinuviel'' (1983), for countertenor solo, SATB choir, and piano accompaniment has been published in score, but not yet recorded.

[[Leonard Rosenman]] composed music for the [[Ralph Bakshi]] animated movie and [[Howard Shore]] composed the music for the three [[Peter Jackson]] films (see [[Music of The Lord of the Rings film series|Music of ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]]).

[[Stephen Oliver (composer)|Stephen Oliver]] composed his incidental music score for the 1981 BBC radio drama adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings''.

Paul Corfield Godfrey has written a large number of works based on Tolkien, the most significant of which is the four-evening cycle on ''[[The Silmarillion]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/956-Interview_with_Paul_Corfield_Godfrey.php |title=Interview with Paul Corfield Godfrey, composer of the Silmarillion Opera-cycle |first=Jeroen |last=Bakker |work=Tolkien Library}}</ref> but also including three operas based on ''The Lord of the Rings'': ''Tom Bombadil'' (one act), ''The Black Gate is closed'' (three acts) and ''The Grey Havens''. He has also published several sets of songs including ''Seven Tolkien Songs'', ''Songs of the Mark'' and ''Shadow-Bride''. His third symphony, ''Ainulindalë'', is based on the opening chapter of ''The Silmarillion'', and there is also a half-hour setting of ''The Lay of Eärendil'' based on Bilbo's song at Rivendell (in the expanded version published by Christopher Tolkien in The Treason of Isengard). All the texts were used with permission of the Tolkien Estate and Harper Collins Publishers.

The [[Tolkien Ensemble]] published four CDs from 1997 to 2005 with the aim to create \"the world's first complete musical interpretation of the poems and songs from ''The Lord of the Rings''\". The project was given approval by both the [[Tolkien Estate]] and [[Harper Collins]] Publishers. Queen Margarethe II of Denmark gave permission to use her illustrations in the CD layout.

[[Aulis Sallinen]], one of the leading [[classical music]] composers of [[Finland]], composed his [[Symphonies (Sallinen)|Seventh Symphony]] named \"The Dreams of Gandalf\" in 1996, as a commission by the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra.

Patrick Flegg, late husband of Tolkien illustrator [[Mary Fairburn]], composed a piano suite, ''Anduin: The Mighty River'', recorded by Wendy Rowlands (2001).<ref>https://myspace.com/oddssods</ref>

[[A.R. Rahman]] collaborated with [[Värttinä]] to compose the music for the stage adaptation ''The Lord of the Rings Musical''.

''The Loss and the Silence'', a string quartet by [[Ezequiel Viñao]] (inspired by [[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen|the story of Aragorn and Arwen]]), was commissioned for the 100th anniversary of the [[Juilliard School]] and was premiered by the [[Juilliard String Quartet]].

Canadian composer [[Glenn Buhr]] has written a three-movement tone poem ''Beren and Lúthien'' which he has recorded with the [[Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra]] as part of his CD ''Winter Poems''.<ref>https://www.musiccentre.ca/node/8763</ref>

The works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] have served as the inspiration to
painters, musicians, film-makers and writers, to such an extent that Tolkien is sometimes seen as the \"father\" of the entire genre of [[high fantasy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8119893978710705002 |title=J.

Tolkien: A Biography'' (London: Allen and Unwin, 1977), 89-90.</ref>}}

==Art and illustration==
The earliest illustrations of Tolkien's works were drawn by the author himself. In 1937, ''The Hobbit'' was first illustrated by professional draughtsmen for the American edition. Tolkien was very critical of these, and in 1946 he rejected illustrations by [[Horus Engels]] for the German edition of the ''Hobbit'' as \"too '[[The Walt Disney Company|Disnified]]'\".<ref>7 December 1946, ''The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien: A Selection'', ed. Humphrey Carpenter, with the assistance of Christopher Tolkien (London: Allen and Unwin, 1981), no. 107</ref>

In 1948, [[Milein Cosman]] was invited by Tolkien's publishers to submit illustrations for ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''. 
Tolkien felt her impressionistic style did not suit the story, and she was replaced by [[Pauline Baynes]], who later also supplied the illustrations for ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' (1962) and ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'' (1967). In 1968, Tolkien was sent a number of a suite of illustrations of ''The Lord of the Rings'', mostly in coloured ink, by English artist [[Mary Fairburn]]; Tolkien said of her pictures: \"They ... show far more attention to the text than any that have yet been submitted to me.... I am beginning to ... think that an illustrated edition might be a good thing.\" For various reasons the project went no further, and Fairburn's illustrations were unknown until 2012.<ref>Tankard, Paul, \"An Unknown Vision of Middle-earth: Mary Fairburn: Tolkien Illustrator\", ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', 14 September 2012. http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1124297.ece</ref> Crown Princess Margrethe (now [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]]) of Denmark, an accomplished and critically acclaimed painter, was inspired to illustrations to ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the early 1970s. She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity to the style of his own drawings.{{citation needed<!--ME-fact-->|date=October 2007}} In 1977, Queen Margrethe's drawings were published in the Danish translation of the book, which was reissued in 2002,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/profiles/queenmargrethe/| title=Queen Margrethe II of Denmark|work =Hello Magazine|accessdate=29 May 2006}}</ref> redrawn by the British artist [[Eric Fraser (illustrator)|Eric Fraser]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Lord of the Rings|last=Tolkien|first=J. R. R.|publisher=The Folio Society|year=1977|location=London|pages=title page}}</ref> These images were also included in the English edition of 1977 by the [[Folio Society]].

[[The Brothers Hildebrandt|Tim and Greg Hildebrandt]] were also well-known Tolkien illustrators during the first decades after the publication of ''The Lord of the Rings''.

In the 1970s, British artist [[Jimmy Cauty]] created a best-selling poster of [[The Lord of the Rings]] (1976) and The [[Hobbit]] (1980) for the retailer [[Athena (retailer)|Athena]].<ref>Spencer, Neil, \"A guerrilla raid on the arts establishment\", ''[[The Guardian]]'' ([[Manchester]]) {{ISSN|0261-3077}} , 31 October 1993, ''The Observer Review Page''.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://klf.de/home/jimmy-cauty-solo-projects/athena-posters/|title=Jimmy Cauty's Athena Posters|website=KLF ONLINE|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-19}}</ref>

Probably the widest-known Tolkien illustrators of the 1990s and 2000s are [[John Howe (illustrator)|John Howe]], [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], and [[Ted Nasmith]] — Alan Lee for illustrated editions of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', Ted Nasmith for illustrated editions of ''The Silmarillion'', and John Howe for the cover artwork to several Tolkien publications. Howe and Lee were also involved in the creation of [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|film trilogy]] as concept artists – Nasmith was also invited to take part in the films, but was forced to reluctantly decline due to a personal crisis at the time. In 2004, Lee won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction for his work on the film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/76academyawards/nomswins.html| title=76th Academy Awards|work =Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=29 May 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060219061720/http://www.oscars.org/76academyawards/nomswins.html |archivedate = 19 February 2006}}</ref>

Other artists who have found inspiration in Tolkien's works include Catherine Karina Chmiel, [[Inger Edelfeldt]], [[Anke Eißmann]], [[Roger Garland (artist)|Roger Garland]], [[Michael Hague]], [[Tove Jansson]] (of [[Moomin]] fame, illustrator of Swedish and Finnish translations of ''[[The Hobbit]]''), Jay Johnstone, [[Paul R Gregory|Paul Raymond Gregory]], [[Tim Kirk]], [[Angus McBride]], [[Jef Murray]], [[Kay Miner]], [[Billy Mosig]], [[Colleen Doran]], [[Jenny Dolfen]], [[Matěj Čadil]] and [[Peter Xavier Price]].

==Film==
[[File:Hobbiton.jpg|thumb|New Zealand's \"[[Hobbiton]]\" where ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy was filmed.]]
[[File:Sir Peter Jackson.jpg|thumb|Peter Jackson, director of six Tolkien adaptations, at the site of filming of the ''The Hobbit'' trilogy.]]
{{Main|Middle-earth in film}}
Tolkien originally sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' to [[United Artists]] in 1968, but they never made a film, and in 1976 the rights were sold to [[Tolkien Enterprises]], a division of the [[Saul Zaentz]] Company.

In the early seventies [[John Boorman]] was planning a film of ''The Lord of the Rings'', but the plans never went further because of movie studio politics. Some of the work done was resurrected for the film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' in 1981.

[[Ralph Bakshi]] directed an animated movie adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' in 1978 (partly made with the [[rotoscope]] technique), which covered only the first half of ''The Lord of the Rings''. [[Rankin-Bass]] covered the second half with a children's TV animation ''[[The Return of the King (1980 movie)|The Return of the King]]'' (1980); earlier they had made a TV animation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' (1977).

''The Lord of the Rings'' was adapted as a [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|trilogy of films]] (2001–03), directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. ''The Hobbit'' was also adapted as a [[The Hobbit (film series)|trilogy]] (2012–14), with some elements adapted from ''The Return of the King'''s Appendices, resulting in noticeable divergences with the novel.

The split of Tolkien's works between [[Tolkien Enterprises]] and the [[Tolkien Estate]] means that none of the Tolkien Enterprises' products can include source material from outside ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', and therefore a film or stage version of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' is highly unlikely.

[[Babylon 5#Influences|Comparisons]] have been made to the plot of the [[science fiction]] [[television show]] ''[[Babylon 5]]'' and Tolkien's works.

==Games==
There are multiple model-based games, trading card games, board games and [[video game]]s that take place in Middle-earth, most depicting scenes and characters from ''The Lord of the Rings.''  In a broader sense, many fantasy [[role-playing games]] such as ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' and ''[[DragonQuest]]'' were strongly influenced by Tolkien's works. Such games feature creatures such as Orcs, Trolls, Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Ents which are common to Tolkien's mythos even if they do not take place in Middle-earth.

===Video games===
{{Main|Middle-earth in video games}}
The books have been reproduced in video game form a number of times during the 1980s and 2000s, including [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]]'s ''Lord of the Rings'', ''Shadows of Mordor'', ''[[War in Middle-earth]]''; [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]]'s ''Lord of the Rings Vol. 1'' and ''Lord of the Rings Vol. 2.''; [[Electronic Arts]]' action [[platformer]] adaptations of ''The Two Towers'' and ''The Return of the King'', [[real-time strategy game]]s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', and the [[role-playing game]] ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]],'' all based on the Jackson films; and [[Sierra Entertainment]]'s action platformer based on ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. There is also a [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] Game titled ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tactics]]'' based on the Jackson films, a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] by [[Turbine Inc|Turbine]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online|The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]''. [[The Two Towers (MUD)]] is also set in Tolkien's world. [[Lego]]'s licensed theme game version had Japanese anime graphics.

===Other games===
[[Games Workshop]] have made a [[miniature wargame]] called ''[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]]'', which, while part of the film trilogy's merchandise, combines elements from both the books and films. Many of Games Workshop's other battle games that are not directly related to the books have had some key background based on it.

Several other games have been based directly on ''The Lord of the Rings'' and related works, including, amongst many, [[Iron Crown Enterprises]]' ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'' game (1982–1999) and ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'' (1995–1999), as well as ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'' ([[2001 in games|2001]]) made by [[Decipher, Inc.]] All of these predate Jackson's film trilogy except for Decipher's card game, which is part of the latter's merchandise.

Decipher also created the ''[[Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]'', a role-playing game based on the Jackson films.

Board games include ''[[Risk: Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition]]'' and another simply entitled ''[[Lord of the Rings (board game)|Lord of the Rings]]'', as well as the ''Middle Earth Games'' from [[Simulations Publications, Inc.]]  containing the games ''War of the Ring'' (strategic, covering all three books), ''Gondor'' (tactical, covering the siege of Minas Tirith) and ''Sauron'' (covering the decisive battle of the Second Age) in [[1977 in games|1977]]. A more recent strategic game covering all three books, called ''[[War of the Ring (board game)|War of the Ring]]'', was released in [[2004 in games|2004]]. There are also ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'' and ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' editions based on ''The Lord of the Rings'', as well as a ''The Lord of the Rings Trivia Game'' quiz game. Chess sets have also been created with the figures based on people and other characters from ''The Lord of the Rings''. there has also been a game on the Nintendo WII. It was \"The Lord of the Rings, Aragorn's Quest\" which is a third person game based on Aragon's role in the book.

===Homages===
{{original research|section|date=September 2010}}
The creators of the ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]] were also strongly influenced by Tolkien. The game has (clearly Tolkien-influenced) dwarves and elves as playable characters, and formerly had hobbits as well. After being threatened with a lawsuit by the [[Saul Zaentz]] company, [[Tolkien Enterprises]], they replaced hobbits with the similar \"halflings\" — a term also used in ''The Lord of the Rings'', balrogs with 'balor-demons' and other genericized names. In most versions of the game, halflings were especially good at being thieves/rogues, a nod to Bilbo the thief in ''The Hobbit''. His works also indirectly inspired the [[Warcraft]] series via their use in [[Games Workshop]]'s battle games.

Equally common is the use of the term [[orc]] for a variety of hobgoblin type creatures in later fantasy although Tolkien popularized this modern usage of the word. Even more removed genre games such as ''[[Shadowrun]]'' and ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' use the term, therein spelt Ork, possibly to sidestep possible legal issues (though Tolkien actually preferred ''-k'' in late writings).

==Literature==

Many authors have found inspiration in Tolkien's work as well.

McKiernan]</ref>

Throughout the next two decades, the term \"[[fantasy]]\" became synonymous with the general aspects of Tolkien's work: multiple races including dwarves and elves, a quest to destroy a magical artifact, and an evil that seeks to control the world. The plot of Novelist [[Pat Murphy (writer)|Pat Murphy]]'s ''[[There and Back Again (novel)|There and Back Again]]'' intentionally mirrors that of ''The Hobbit'', but is transposed into a science-fiction setting involving space travel. [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' has been seen as having been influenced by Tolkien's work, particularly the wizard [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] being partially inspired by Tolkien's Gandalf.<ref>Louise Wetherill, ''Ampthill Literary Festival Yearbook 2015.''

Some people have gone so far as to accuse Paolini of plagiarism.<ref>[http://aydee.wordpress.com/2006/12/17/eragon/ Eragon – Plagiarism Made Popular]</ref> S.M. Stirling's [[The Emberverse series|\"Emberverse\"]] series includes a character obsessed with ''The Lord of the Rings'' who creates a post-apocalyptic community based upon the Elves and Dúnedain of Middle-earth. The same plot point was used by the Russian writer [[Vladimir Berezin (writer)|Vladimir Berezin]] in his novel ''Road Signs'' (from the [[Universe of Metro 2033]]). Another Russian writer, [[Kirill Eskov]], wrote ''[[The Last Ringbearer]]'', about the events in ''Lord of the Rings'' from the perspective of Sauron. [[Stephen King]], best known for horror novels, has acknowledged Tolkien's influence on his novel ''[[The Stand]]'' as well as his fantasy series ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]''. Several other prominent fantasy writers, including [[George R. R. Martin]], [[Michael Swanwick]], [[Raymond E. Feist]], [[Poul Anderson]], [[Karen Haber]], [[Harry Turtledove]], [[Charles De Lint]], and [[Orson Scott Card]], have all acknowledged Tolkien's work as an inspiration for their own fantasy work.<ref name=\"ts\" />

===Poetry===
Some people were inspired to compose poems in [[Quenya]] or [[Sindarin]], the two most developed of Tolkien's created languages. For example, [[Helge Kåre Fauskanger]] translated the first two chapters of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] into Quenya. ''[[Tyalië Tyelelliéva]]'' is a journal dedicated to poems in the Elvish languages.

===Comics===
Cartoonist [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]] was influenced by Tolkien, and the mythologies that inspired his works. His epic 1,300-page graphic novel, ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]'' has been characterized by him as \"[[Bugs Bunny]] meets ''The Lord of the Rings''. It's a really long fairy tale with some fantasy elements but a lot of comedy.\"<ref name=TheCartoonist>{{cite AV media|people = Ken Mills (Director) |title =[[The Cartoonist: Jeff Smith, BONE and the Changing Face of Comics]]|medium = Documentary|publisher = Mills James Productions|date = 21 July 2009}}</ref>

==Radio plays==
{{Main|Adaptations of The Lord of the Rings}}

Three [[radio plays]] based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' have been made, broadcast in 1955–1956, 1979 and 1981 respectively. The first and last ones were produced by the [[BBC]].

==Music==
Numerous songs and other musical works, in a wide range of idioms, have been inspired by or refer to the fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien.

===Rock and heavy metal music===
[[File:Hansi Kursch.jpg|thumb|[[Hansi Kürsch]], the [[Blind Guardian]] vocalist and lyrics writer, composed many songs about Middle Earth]]
<!--Please do NOT describe every song trivia in detail. It is enough to add a band to the list -->

Jack Bruce wrote a song called \"To Isengard\", included in his first solo album \"Songs for a taylor\" (1969). [[Progressive rock]] acts like [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Mostly Autumn]], [[Glass Hammer]], [[Bo Hansson]] and indie rock band [[Gatsbys American Dream]] have composed several songs based on Tolkien's characters and stories. [[Camel (band)|Camel]]'s \"Nimrodel/The Procession/The White Rider\" is obviously about Gandalf.

'''Gaithersburg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|eɪ|ð|ər|z|.|b|ər|g}} {{pronunciation|Pronunciation of \"Gaithersburg\" (city in Maryland).ogg}}), officially the '''City of Gaithersburg''', is a city in [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], [[Maryland]], United States. At the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], Gaithersburg had a population of 59,933, making it the fourth-largest incorporated city in the state, behind [[Baltimore]], [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], and [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]].<ref>[https://www.census.gov U.S. Census website], U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved June 17, 2011.</ref> Gaithersburg is located to the northwest of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and is considered a suburb and a primary city within the [[Washington metropolitan area|Washington–Arlington–Alexandria, DC–VA–MD–WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Gaithersburg was incorporated as a town in 1878 and as a city in 1968.

Gaithersburg is divided into east and west sections, separated by [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]]. The eastern section of the city is older and is the original portion of the town before more recent growth. Landmarks and buildings from that time can still be seen in many places but especially in the historic central business district of Gaithersburg called \"Olde Towne\". The east side also includes [[Lakeforest Mall]], City Hall, and the Montgomery County Fair grounds, and Bohrer Park (a well-known joint community recreation center and outdoor water park for kids and families). The west side of the city has many wealthier neighborhoods that were designed with smart growth techniques and embrace [[New Urbanism]].  These include the award-winning [[Kentlands]] community, the Lakelands community, and the Washingtonian Center (better known as Rio), a popular shopping/business district. Consumers often come to this area during Black Friday and other shopping holidays for the deals and variety of huge brand name stores like Target and Dick's Sporting Goods, and smaller stores like Francesca's and Blue Mercury.  Two New Urbanism communities are under construction, including [[Watkins Mill Town Center]] (Casey East and West), and the massive \"Science City\".  The state has a [[bus rapid transit]] line, Corridor Cities Transitway or \"CCT\", planned for the western portion of the city starting at Shady Grove Metro Station and connecting all the high density western Gaithersburg neighborhoods with a total of eight stops planned in the city.

The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) is headquartered in Gaithersburg directly west of I-270.{{refn|Although NIST's mailing address states Gaithersburg, and the City of Gaithersburg surrounds NIST's property, the land where NIST is situated is not incorporated into the City of Gaithersburg. Instead, it is in an unincorporated part of Montgomery County. Owing to the manner in which land has been added to Gaithersburg over the years, there are multiple such unincorporated [[Enclave and exclave|enclaves]] within the perimeter; see the [https://web.archive.org/web/20050516070202/http://www.gaithersburgmd.gov:80/documents/zoning_3_2005.pdf City's Zoning Map] for details (3MB PDF).|group=N}} Other major employers in the city include [[IBM]], [[Lockheed Martin]] Information Systems and Global Services business area headquarters, [[AstraZeneca]], and the French [[multinational corporation]], [[Sodexo]].  Gaithersburg is also the location of the garrison of the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Reserve]]'s [[220th Military Police Brigade (United States)|220th Military Police Brigade]].

Gaithersburg is noted for its ethnic and economic diversity; [[WalletHub]] in 2016 ranked it first among the 313 largest U.S. cities for ethnic diversity and second for social class diversity.<ref>Richie Bernardo, [https://wallethub.com/edu/most-diverse-cities/12690/ 2016’s Most Diverse Cities in America], [[WalletHub]] (May 11, 2016) (viewed Sept. 12, 2016).</ref>

Gaithersburg was settled in 1765 as a small [[agricultural]] settlement known as Log Town near the present day Summit Hall on Ralph Crabb's 1725 land grant \"Deer Park\".<ref name=fairs>{{unbulleted list|{{cite news |title=Md. Offers Two Fairs for Sunday |last=Eddy |first=Kristin |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 17, 1987 |page=M09}}|{{cite news |title=Md. Offers Two Fairs for Sunday |last=Eddy |first=Kristin |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 17, 1987 |page=M09 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/139343953.html}}}}</ref> The northern portion of the land grant was purchased by Henry Brookes, and he built his brick home \"Montpelier\" there, starting first with a log cabin in 1780/3.  This 1,000 acre tract became part of the landmark IBM Headquarters complex built on the then-new I-270 Interstate \"Industrial\", now \"Technology\", Corridor in the late 1960s to the 1970s. [[Benjamin Gaither]] married Henry's daughter Margaret, and Benjamin and Margaret inherited a portion of Henry's land prior to Henry's death in 1807. Gaither built his home on the land in 1802.<ref>{{cite news |title=20,000 Expected to Wish Gaithersburg Happy Birthday |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 4, 1950 |page=3 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/152229303.html}}{{closed access}}</ref> By the 1850s the area had ceased to be called Log Town and was known to inhabitants as Gaithersburg.<ref name=\"Offutt\">{{cite book |last=Offutt |first=William |author2=Sween, Jane |title=Montgomery County: Centuries of Change |publisher=American Historical Press |year=1999 |pages=166–167}}</ref>

===19th century===
The Forest Oak Post Office, named for a large tree in the town, was located in Gaither's store in 1851. However, when the railroad was built through town the new station was called Gaithersburg, an officially recognized name for the community for the first time.

The town incorporated under its current name in 1878. Gaithersburg boomed during the late 19th century and churches, schools, a mill, [[grain elevator]]s, stores, and hotels were built. Much of this development focused around the railroad station.<ref name=Offutt/>

In 1873 the [[B&O Railroad]] constructed a station at Gaithersburg,<ref name=fairs/> designed by [[Ephraim Francis Baldwin]] as part of his well-known series of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] stations in Maryland.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gaithersburg Station |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 17, 1985 |page=MDA4 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138469281.html |location=Washington, D.C.}}{{closed access}}</ref> Rapid growth occurred shortly thereafter, and on April 5, 1878 the town was officially incorporated as the Town of Gaithersburg.

In 1899, Gaithersburg was selected as one of six global locations for the construction of an [[International Latitude Observatory]] as part of a project to measure the Earth's wobble on its polar axis. The [[Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory]] is (as of 2007) the only [[National Historic Landmark]] in the City of Gaithersburg. The observatory and five others in [[Japan]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], and the [[United States]] gathered information that is still used by scientists today, along with information from [[satellites]], to determine [[polar motion]]; the size, shape, and physical properties of the earth; and to aid the space program through the precise navigational patterns of orbiting satellites. The Gaithersburg station operated until 1982 when computerization rendered the manual observation obsolete.

===Late 20th century===
In 1968, Gaithersburg was upgraded from a town to a city.

Gaithersburg remained a predominantly rural farm town until the 1970s when more construction began. As the population grew, with homes spreading throughout the area, Gaithersburg began taking on a suburban and semi-urban feel, leaving its farming roots behind. During the late 1990s and 2000s, it had become one of the most economically and ethnically diverse areas in the [[Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area|Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area]] as well as the [[Maryland|State of Maryland]], with people from all walks of life calling Gaithersburg home. This can be seen in the local schools, with [[Gaithersburg High School]] and [[Watkins Mill High School]] having two of the most diverse student bodies in the region.

During a 1997 rainstorm, the 295-year-old forest oak tree that gave its name to the Forest Oak Post Office crashed down.<ref name=goesdown>{{cite news |title=Gaithersburg Tree Goes Down in History: Storm Fells City's Famed Forest Oak |last=Vogel |first=Steve |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 28, 1997 |page=B1 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/doc/408326857.html |location=Washington, D.C. }}{{closed access}}</ref> The tree served as the inspiration for the city's logo,<ref name= goesdown/> which is also featured prominently on the city's flag.<ref name= goesdown/>

===21st century===
In 2007, parts of the film ''[[Body of Lies (film)|Body of Lies]]'' were filmed in the city, at a building on 100 Edison Park Drive. The film was released in 2008 and the building is now the [[Montgomery County Police Department]]'s headquarters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww2.gazette.net/stories/091207/potonew200048_32356.shtml|title=Spy thriller brings a touch of Hollywood to the county|date=17 March 2015|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317165446/http://ww2.gazette.net/stories/091207/potonew200048_32356.shtml|archivedate=17 March 2015}}</ref>

'''Gaithersburg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|eɪ|ð|ər|z|.|b|ər|g}} {{pronunciation|Pronunciation of \"Gaithersburg\" (city in Maryland).ogg}}), officially the '''City of Gaithersburg''', is a city in [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], [[Maryland]], United States. At the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], Gaithersburg had a population of 59,933, making it the fourth-largest incorporated city in the state, behind [[Baltimore]], [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], and [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]].<ref>[https://www.census.gov U.S. Census website], U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved June 17, 2011.</ref> Gaithersburg is located to the northwest of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and is considered a suburb and a primary city within the [[Washington metropolitan area|Washington–Arlington–Alexandria, DC–VA–MD–WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Gaithersburg was incorporated as a town in 1878 and as a city in 1968.

Gaithersburg is divided into east and west sections, separated by [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]]. The eastern section of the city is older and is the original portion of the town before more recent growth. Landmarks and buildings from that time can still be seen in many places but especially in the historic central business district of Gaithersburg called \"Olde Towne\". The east side also includes [[Lakeforest Mall]], City Hall, and the Montgomery County Fair grounds, and Bohrer Park (a well-known joint community recreation center and outdoor water park for kids and families). The west side of the city has many wealthier neighborhoods that were designed with smart growth techniques and embrace [[New Urbanism]].  These include the award-winning [[Kentlands]] community, the Lakelands community, and the Washingtonian Center (better known as Rio), a popular shopping/business district. Consumers often come to this area during Black Friday and other shopping holidays for the deals and variety of huge brand name stores like Target and Dick's Sporting Goods, and smaller stores like Francesca's and Blue Mercury.  Two New Urbanism communities are under construction, including [[Watkins Mill Town Center]] (Casey East and West), and the massive \"Science City\".  The state has a [[bus rapid transit]] line, Corridor Cities Transitway or \"CCT\", planned for the western portion of the city starting at Shady Grove Metro Station and connecting all the high density western Gaithersburg neighborhoods with a total of eight stops planned in the city.

The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) is headquartered in Gaithersburg directly west of I-270.{{refn|Although NIST's mailing address states Gaithersburg, and the City of Gaithersburg surrounds NIST's property, the land where NIST is situated is not incorporated into the City of Gaithersburg.

Gaithersburg was settled in 1765 as a small [[agricultural]] settlement known as Log Town near the present day Summit Hall on Ralph Crabb's 1725 land grant \"Deer Park\".<ref name=fairs>{{unbulleted list|{{cite news |title=Md.

This 1,000 acre tract became part of the landmark IBM Headquarters complex built on the then-new I-270 Interstate \"Industrial\", now \"Technology\", Corridor in the late 1960s to the 1970s. [[Benjamin Gaither]] married Henry's daughter Margaret, and Benjamin and Margaret inherited a portion of Henry's land prior to Henry's death in 1807. Gaither built his home on the land in 1802.<ref>{{cite news |title=20,000 Expected to Wish Gaithersburg Happy Birthday |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 4, 1950 |page=3 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/152229303.html}}{{closed access}}</ref> By the 1850s the area had ceased to be called Log Town and was known to inhabitants as Gaithersburg.<ref name=\"Offutt\">{{cite book |last=Offutt |first=William |author2=Sween, Jane |title=Montgomery County: Centuries of Change |publisher=American Historical Press |year=1999 |pages=166–167}}</ref>

===19th century===
The Forest Oak Post Office, named for a large tree in the town, was located in Gaither's store in 1851. However, when the railroad was built through town the new station was called Gaithersburg, an officially recognized name for the community for the first time.

The town incorporated under its current name in 1878. Gaithersburg boomed during the late 19th century and churches, schools, a mill, [[grain elevator]]s, stores, and hotels were built. Much of this development focused around the railroad station.<ref name=Offutt/>

In 1873 the [[B&O Railroad]] constructed a station at Gaithersburg,<ref name=fairs/> designed by [[Ephraim Francis Baldwin]] as part of his well-known series of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] stations in Maryland.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gaithersburg Station |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 17, 1985 |page=MDA4 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138469281.html |location=Washington, D.C.}}{{closed access}}</ref> Rapid growth occurred shortly thereafter, and on April 5, 1878 the town was officially incorporated as the Town of Gaithersburg.

In 1899, Gaithersburg was selected as one of six global locations for the construction of an [[International Latitude Observatory]] as part of a project to measure the Earth's wobble on its polar axis. The [[Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory]] is (as of 2007) the only [[National Historic Landmark]] in the City of Gaithersburg. The observatory and five others in [[Japan]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], and the [[United States]] gathered information that is still used by scientists today, along with information from [[satellites]], to determine [[polar motion]]; the size, shape, and physical properties of the earth; and to aid the space program through the precise navigational patterns of orbiting satellites. The Gaithersburg station operated until 1982 when computerization rendered the manual observation obsolete.

===Late 20th century===
In 1968, Gaithersburg was upgraded from a town to a city.

Gaithersburg remained a predominantly rural farm town until the 1970s when more construction began. As the population grew, with homes spreading throughout the area, Gaithersburg began taking on a suburban and semi-urban feel, leaving its farming roots behind. During the late 1990s and 2000s, it had become one of the most economically and ethnically diverse areas in the [[Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area|Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area]] as well as the [[Maryland|State of Maryland]], with people from all walks of life calling Gaithersburg home. This can be seen in the local schools, with [[Gaithersburg High School]] and [[Watkins Mill High School]] having two of the most diverse student bodies in the region.

During a 1997 rainstorm, the 295-year-old forest oak tree that gave its name to the Forest Oak Post Office crashed down.<ref name=goesdown>{{cite news |title=Gaithersburg Tree Goes Down in History: Storm Fells City's Famed Forest Oak |last=Vogel |first=Steve |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 28, 1997 |page=B1 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/doc/408326857.html |location=Washington, D.C. }}{{closed access}}</ref> The tree served as the inspiration for the city's logo,<ref name= goesdown/> which is also featured prominently on the city's flag.<ref name= goesdown/>

In 2007, parts of the film ''[[Body of Lies (film)|Body of Lies]]'' were filmed in the city, at a building on 100 Edison Park Drive. The film was released in 2008 and the building is now the [[Montgomery County Police Department]]'s headquarters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww2.gazette.net/stories/091207/potonew200048_32356.shtml|title=Spy thriller brings a touch of Hollywood to the county|date=17 March 2015|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317165446/http://ww2.gazette.net/stories/091207/potonew200048_32356.shtml|archivedate=17 March 2015}}</ref>

'''John Hampden''', circa June 1595 –  24 June 1643, was an English landowner and politician, whose opposition to arbitrary taxes imposed by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] made him a national figure. An ally of [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] leader [[John Pym]], and cousin to [[Oliver Cromwell]], he was one of the [[Five Members]] whose attempted arrest in January 1642 sparked the [[First English Civil War]].

After war began in August 1642, Hampden raised an infantry regiment, and died of wounds received at the [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]] on 18 June 1643. His loss was considered a serious blow, largely because he was one of the few Parliamentary leaders able to hold the different factions together. 

His death in 1643 meant he avoided the bitter internal debates later in the war, the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, and establishment of [[The Protectorate]]. As a result, he is considered a less complex figure than either Cromwell, or even Pym; in 1841, his statue was erected in the [[Palace of Westminster]], to represent the Parliamentary cause.{{efn|The Royalist chosen was another moderate, [[Lucius_Cary,_2nd_Viscount_Falkland|Viscount Falkland]], killed at [[First_Battle_of_Newbury|Newbury]] three months later.}}    

A reputation for honest, principled, and patriotic opposition to arbitrary rule also made him a popular figure in [[North America]]. Prior to the 1774 [[American Revolution]], [[Benjamin_Franklin|Franklin]] and [[John_Adams|Adams]] were among those who referenced him to justify their cause.{{sfn|Jansson|2009|pp=11-12}}

==Biographical==
[[File:Gt Hampden Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great_and_Little_Hampden|Great Hampden church]], where Hampden and other family members were baptised, and later buried]]
John Hampden was born around June 1595, probably in [[London]], eldest son of William Hampden, (1570-1597), and Elizabeth Cromwell, (1574-1664); he had a younger brother, Richard, 1596 to 1659.{{sfn|Thompson|2010}}  

The Hampden family had been established in [[Buckinghamshire]] for many years; William was a lawyer, and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East_Looe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|East Looe]] in 1593.{{sfn|WJJ|1981}} He died in April 1597; his cousin, William Hampden of Ennington, was appointed executor, but became involved in a bitter legal dispute with Elizabeth.{{sfn|Russell|2008}}

In 1619, John married Elizabeth Symeon, and prior to her death in 1631, they had nine children. Seven survived into adulthood Ann (1616-1701), Elizabeth (1619-1643), John (1621-1642), William (died 1675), Ruth (1628-1687), Mary (1630-1689), and [[Richard_Hampden|Richard]] (1631-1695), [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under [[William III of England|William III]].<ref>{{cite web |title=John Hampden |url=https://www.geni.com/people/John-Hampden-Patriae-Pater/6000000003266399664 |website=Geni.com |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> In 1640, he married Letitia Knollys (1591-1666); they had no children.   

==Career==
In 1610, he graduated from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]; as legal training was then considered part of a gentleman's education, he attended the [[Inner Temple]] from 1613 to 1615. 

The Hampden family were [[Puritan]]s, a term then used for anyone who wanted to reform, or 'purify', the [[Church of England]]. It covered a variety of [[Christian_theology|doctrines]], of which [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] such as Hampden were the most prominent; it connected him to a network that included [[Richard_Knightley_(died_1639)|Sir Richard Knightley]], [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], and [[John_Preston_(priest)|John Preston]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} 

In 1621, Hampden was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]], a [[Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs|rotten borough]] in [[Cornwall]]. This is thought to have been through the influence of the local magnate, [[John_Arundell_(born_1576)|John Arundell]]; a good example of the complexity of the period, Arundell opposed [[Ship Money]] in 1636, but held [[Pendennis Castle]] for [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] until 1646.{{sfn|Duffin|Hunneyball|2010}}  
[[File:John Pym.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Pym]]; Hampden joined his attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]] in 1628]]
He financed the cost of restoring Parliamentary representation to [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]] in 1624, a seat he held until 1629. The [[2nd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1626 Parliament]] refused taxes without an agreement to [[Impeachment_in_the_United_Kingdom|impeach]] Charles' favourite, the [[George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], a military commander notorious for inefficiency, combined with extravagance; only his assassination in August 1628 prevented a second attempt.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} 

Rather than comply, Charles dissolved Parliament, and imposed a forced loan; over 70 individuals were jailed for not contributing, including Hampden's cousin, Sir Edmund Hampden.{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} Like many others, Hampden also refused to subscribe; and reducing the income from the loans. Charles was forced to call a [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]] in March 1627, which resulted in \"a preponderance of MPs opposed to the King\", including Selden, Coke, [[John Pym]] and a young [[Oliver Cromwell]].{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} released to attend the [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]], he supported [[John Pym]] and others in the Parliamentary attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} 

In the 17th century, religion and politics were considered interdependent; 'good government' required 'true religion', and alterations in one, implied alterations in the other.{{efn|This view was summarised by Hampden in the debate on the [[Petition of Right]]; \"Here is 1, an innovation of religion suspected; is it not high time to take it to heart and acquaint his Majesty? 2ly, alteration of government; can you forbear when it goes no less than the subversion of the whole state? 3ly, hemmed in with enemies; is it now a time to be silent, and not to show to his Majesty that a man that has so much power uses none of it to help us? If he be no papist, papists are friends and kindred to him.\"{{sfn|Keeler|Janssen Cole|1997|pp=121-122}}}} The two published [[sermons]], supporting the Caroline precepts of the [[divine right of kings]], and [[passive obedience]]; although censured for preaching against the established English constitution, Charles pardoned them, and made Sibthorpe a royal [[chaplain]].{{sfn|Little|2008|p=33}} 

and in 1629, he dissolved Parliament, initiating the period of [[Personal Rule]] that continued until 1640

In April 1640 he was elected MP for [[Buckinghamshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckinghamshire]] in the [[Short Parliament]] and was re-elected MP for Buckinghamshire for the [[Long Parliament]] in November 1640.<ref name=Willis>{{Cite Notitia Parliamentaria|converted=1|part=2|pages=229–239}}</ref> He sat until his death in 1643.

In the early days of his parliamentary career, he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], as in its later days he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Pym]] and to be commanded by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].



===Views on ship money===
Something of Hampden's fame no doubt is owing to the position which he took up as the opponent of [[ship money]].<ref>Gross, David (ed.) ''We Won't Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 9–16</ref> But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others as far as possible from the evil consequences of their actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.

===Committee work===
During these first parliaments Hampden did not, so far as we know, speak in public debate, but he was increasingly employed in [[committee]] work, for which he seems to have had a special aptitude. In 1626 he took an active part in the preparation of the charges against [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. In January 1627 he was bound over to answer at the council board for his refusal to pay the forced loan.  Later in the year he was committed to the gatehouse, and then sent into confinement in [[Hampshire]], from which he was liberated just before the meeting of the third parliament of the reign, in which he once more rendered useful but unobtrusive assistance to his leaders.

When the breach came in 1629 Hampden was found corresponding with the imprisoned Eliot, discussing with him the prospects of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Hampden was one of the persons to whom the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] granted land in [[Connecticut]] in what was then referred to as the [[Saybrook Colony]] and today as [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]]. While some claim there is no foundation but anecdote that Hampden attempted emigration to the colonies with Cromwell, others assert that Cromwell and other future architects of the English Civil War, including Hampden, may have been close to moving to America in the 1630s. The author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] points out that, \"Even in the 1770s, residents of [[Old Saybrook]] still talked about which prominent [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarian]] was to have had which town lot.\"<ref>Alfred A. Young, \"English Plebeian Culture an 18th Century American Radicalism\" in Margret Jacob and James Jacob, eds., \"The Origin of Anglo-American Radicalism\" 9New Jersey, Humanitarian Press International, 19910 Page 195,</ref>

It was not until 1637, however, that his resistance to the payment of ship money gained him wide fame. Seven out of the twelve judges sided against him, but the connection between the rights of property and the parliamentary system became firmly established in the popular mind. The tax had been justified, says Clarendon, who expresses his admiration at Hampden's \"rare temper and modesty\" at this crisis, \"upon such grounds and reasons as every standerby was able to swear was not law\" (''Hist''. i. 150,  vii. 82).

===Short Parliament===
In the Short Parliament that started on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House in the debate on 4 May in its opposition to the grant of twelve subsidies in return for the surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the [[Scotland|Scots]]. During the eventful months which followed, when [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford|Strafford]] was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his [[Bishops' Wars|Scottish war]], rumour has much to tell of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.

===Long Parliament===
In the [[Long Parliament]], though Hampden was by no means a frequent speaker, it is possible to trace his course with sufficient distinctness. His power consisted in his personal influence, and as a debater rather than as an orator.  \"He was not a man of many words,\" says Clarendon, \"and rarely began the discourse or made the first entrance upon any business that was assumed, but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a full debate and observed how the House was likely to be inclined, took up the argument and shortly and clearly and craftily so stated it that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired; and if he found he could not do that, he never was without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future\" (''Hist''. iii. 31). Unwearied in attendance upon committees, he was in all things ready to second Pym, whom he plainly regarded as his leader.

Hampden was one of the eight managers of Strafford's prosecution. Like Pym, he was in favour of the more legal and regular procedure by [[impeachment]] rather than by [[attainder]], which at the later stage was supported by the majority of the Commons; and through his influence a compromise was effected by which, while an attainder was subsequently adopted, Strafford's counsel were heard as in the case of an impeachment, and thus a serious breach between the two Houses, which threatened to cause the breakdown of the whole proceedings, was averted.

===Debate on episcopacy===
[[File:John Hampden Statue.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of John Hampden in Market Square, [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire]]

There was another point on which there was no agreement. A large minority wished to retain [[episcopacy]], and to keep the [[Book of Common Prayer]] unaltered, whilst the majority were at least willing to consider the question of abolishing the one and modifying the other. On this subject the parties which ultimately divided the House and the country itself were fully formed as early as 8 February 1641. It is enough to say that Hampden fully shared in the counsels of the opponents of episcopacy. It is not that he was a theoretical [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], but the [[bishop]]s had been in his days so fully engaged in the imposition of ceremonies regarded by the [[Puritans]] as verging on [[Papacy]] that it was difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate them from the cause in which they were embarked.  Closely connected with Hampden's distrust of the bishops was his distrust of monarchy as it then existed. The dispute about the church therefore soon attained the form of an attack upon [[monarchy]], and, when the majority of the [[House of Lords]] arrayed itself on the side of episcopacy and the Prayer Book, of an attack upon the House of Lords as well.

No serious importance therefore can be attached to the offers of advancement made from time to time to Hampden and his friends. Charles would gladly have given them office if they had been ready to desert their principles. Every day Hampden's conviction grew stronger that Charles would never surrender a position which he had taken up. In August 1641 Hampden was one of the four commissioners who attended Charles in Scotland, and the king's conduct there, connected with such events as the \"Incident\", must have proved to a man far less sagacious than Hampden that the time for compromise had gone by. He was therefore a warm supporter of the [[Grand Remonstrance]], and was marked out as one of the five impeached members, known thenceforth in history as the [[Five Members]] (the others being [[John Pym]], [[Arthur Haselrig]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]] and [[William Strode]]) whose attempted arrest brought at last the opposing parties into open collision. In the angry scene which arose on the proposal to print the Grand Remonstrance, it was Hampden's personal intervention which prevented an actual conflict, and it was after the impeachment had been attempted that Hampden laid down the two conditions under which resistance to the king became the duty of a good subject.  Those conditions were:
*an attack upon religion and
*an attack upon the fundamental laws.

There can be no doubt that Hampden fully believed that both those conditions were fulfilled at the opening of 1642.

==English Civil War==

When the [[English Civil War]] began, Hampden was appointed a member of the [[ Committee of Safety (England) #1642–1644 | Committee of Safety]], levied a [[regiment]] of Buckinghamshire men for the parliamentary cause, and in his capacity of deputy-lieutenant carried out the parliamentary [[Militia Ordinance]] in the county. In the earlier operations of the war he bore himself gallantly and well. He took no actual part in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] (23 October 1642). His troops in the rear,  however, arrested [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]'s charge at [[Kineton]], and he urged Essex to renew the attack here, and also after the disaster at [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]]. In the spring of 1643, Hampden's regiment took part in the [[siege of Reading]], which surrendered on 27 April. Although Essex intended to advance on the King's headquarters at Oxford, he remained at Reading because of widespread sickness in the army, a shortage of cavalry and to await a paymaster with funds to pay his troops. In early June 1643 he moved his army to Thame making his headquarters there on 10 June.

But it is not on his skill as a regimental officer that Hampden's fame rests. In war as in peace his distinction lay in his power of disentangling the essential part from the non-essential. In the previous constitutional struggle he had seen that the one thing necessary was to establish the supremacy of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  In the military struggle which followed he saw, as Cromwell saw afterwards, that the one thing necessary was to beat the enemy.  He protested at once against Essex's hesitations and compromises.  In the formation of the confederacy of the six associated counties, which was to supply a basis for Cromwell's operations, he took an active part.  His influence was felt alike in parliament and in the field but he was not in supreme command, and he had none of that impatience which often leads able men to fail in the execution of orders of which they disapprove.

===Death===
[[File:Hampden's monument, Chalgrove.jpg|thumb|Hampden's Monument, [[Chalgrove]]. A monument to John Hampden, who was mortally wounded 550 yards north of here in 1643 whilst fighting in the English Civil War on [[Battle of Chalgrove Field|Chalgrove Field]]]]

On the night of 17 June 1643, [[Prince Rupert]] sortied on a raid out of Oxford to capture the Parliamentarian army's paymaster, but while that failed, did succeed the next morning in overwhelming two of Essex's small garrison outposts at [[Postcombe]] and [[Chinnor]]. Hampden rode as a volunteer with 1,100 cavalry and dragoons commanded by Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] in pursuit of Rupert, with the intention of delaying him long enough for a larger force from Essex's main army to cut off his retreat. Rupert halted his own cavalry at [[Chalgrove]] to ambush the pursuit and allow 800 less mobile troops to escape via the ford of the [[River Thame]] at [[Chiselhampton]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]], Hampden was mortally wounded (some sources claim in the shoulder by two carbine balls, others by fragments from his own pistol exploding<ref>Britannica 1911 (article \"HAMPDEN, JOHN\") \"two carbine balls\". [http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/hampden.htm John Hampden, c.1595–1643] on the [http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/ British Civil Wars & Commonwealth website] \"possibly from his own pistol exploding\".</ref>) which shattered the bone and forced him to leave the field. He reached Thame, and his headquarters in the house of Ezekiel Browne (which became the Greyhound Inn).<ref name=\"A Short History of Thame School\"/>{{sfn|Nugent-Grenville|1854|p=361}} He survived six days, and died on 24 June.<ref>John Nichols \"The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 181\". p. 512. E. Cave, 1847</ref>

In the 1976 biography of Hampden written by Prof. John Adair,<ref name=\"adair\">Adair, John Eric, A life of John Hampden, the patriot (1594–1643), London: Macdonald and Jane's, 1976</ref> he concludes that it is most likely that Hampden died from an exploding pistol. [[Frederick Lee (priest)|Frederick George Lee]] in his book ''The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford'' (and available to view at the UK's National Archives or in the Royal Collection) lays out a version of this story.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/1070556/the-history-description-and-antiquities-of-the-prebendal-church-of-the-blessed|title=Lee, Frederick George – The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford ... / by Frederick George Lee.|website=www.royalcollection.org.uk}}</ref>

This account of his death was given by Sir Robert Pye his son-in-law...\"That in the action of Chalgrove Field, his pistol burst and shattered his hand in a terrible manner. He, however, rode off and got to his quarters but finding the wound mortal he sent for Sir Robert Pye then a colonel in the Parliamentary army – and who had married his eldest daughter – and told him that he looked on him in some degree accessory to his death as the pistols were present from him. Sir Robert assured him that he bought them in Paris from an eminent maker and proved them himself. It appeared on examining the other pistol that it was loaded to the muzzle with several supernumerary charges, owning to the carelessness of a servant. He was ordered to see that the pistols were loaded every morning which he did but without drawing the former charge.\" An exhumation of Hampden's body in 1828 showed that there was no damage to the shoulder but his 'right hand was shattered by the bursting of his pistol, and death probably ensued from [[tetanus|lockjaw]] arising out of extensive injury to the nervous system'.<ref>Frederick George Lee, The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford. Published 1883</ref>

It is also worth noting the following:
– in the book ''John Hampden'' by [[Frank Hansford-Miller]] published in 1976, it noted that his death was the result 'from the exploding of his own pistol in his own hand.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hansford-Miller |first1=Frank Herbert |title=John Hampden: an illustrated life of John Hampden, 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Shire Publications |isbn=978-0-85263-322-9 |language=en}}</ref> There has also been a scholarly analysis by the archivists at Hampden's school, Thame Grammar, who also conclude that he died accidentally from his own hand.<ref>[http://oldtamensians.info/current-news/page/4/ Old Tamensians]</ref>

Hampden's death so early in the war was a severe blow to the Parliamentarians.  During the preceding winter, Hampden had associated himself with John Pym's \"Middle Group\" in Parliament, which opposed any peace moves to the King except on favorable terms. At the same time he had worked to moderate the militancy of the parliamentary \"War Party\". Although Hampden was privately critical of Essex for not aggressively attacking after avoiding defeat at Edgehill and the standoff at [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], he remained publicly loyal and helped Essex resist the criticisms of the War Party. His death took with it a key link between the factions. Hearing of his death, the Member of Parliament [[Anthony Nicholl]] pronounced: \"Never Kingdom received a greater loss in one subject, never a man a truer and faithful friend.\"<ref>\"Selected Readings in English History\". p. 265. Ginn, 1913</ref>

Hampden is immortalised in St Stephen's Hall in the Palace of Westminster, where he and other notable Parliamentarians look on at visitors to the UK Parliament.<ref name=ssstat>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/architecture/palace-s-interiors/st-stephen-s-hall/|title=St Stephen's Hall|website=UK Parliament}}</ref>  In Britain diverse establishments are named after him, ranging from [[Hampden Park]], the home ground of [[Queen's Park F.C.]] and the [[Scotland national football team]], to an older persons' mental health unit at [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]]. Several schools use his name: a primary school in [[Wendover]] and another in Thame,  a [[grammar school]] in [[High Wycombe]] and a school in [[Hertfordshire]]. There is also a statue of him in [[Aylesbury]] town centre (illustrated above) pointing to his home in Great Hampden. [[Aylesbury Vale District Council]] use an image of the statue as their logo.

Outside of Britain, the towns of [[Hampden, Maryland]]; [[Hamden, Connecticut]]; [[Hampden, Maine]]; [[Hampden, Massachusetts]]; and [[Hampden, Newfoundland and Labrador]]; as well as the county of [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden]], [[Massachusetts]] are named in his honour. [[Hampden–Sydney College]] in [[Virginia]] is also named in honour of John Hampden and of [[Algernon Sydney]], another English patriot; and [[Mount Hampden]] in [[Zimbabwe]].

[[Thomas Gray]]'s poem \"[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]\" refers to the heroism of Hampden in the stanza:
\"Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast / The little tyrant of his fields withstood;/ Some mute inglorious [[John Milton|Milton]] here may rest, /  Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.\"<ref>\"The Works of Thomas Gray, Containing His Poems and Correspondence: With Memoirs of His Life and Writings, Volume 1\". p.120.

As one of the Five Members of the House of Commons, Hampden is commemorated at the [[State Opening of Parliament]] by the British monarch each year: the sovereign sits on the throne in the House of Lords and sends their messenger [[Black Rod]] to summons the Members of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to attend them. At his approach the doors to the Commons Chamber are slammed in his face, symbolising the refusal by the Commons to be entered by force by the monarch or one of the monarch's servants, and also its right to debate without the presence of the Queen's Representative.<ref name=\"State opening\"/> This is done in relation to the events of 1642, when King Charles I stormed into the House of Commons in an unsuccessful attempt to arrest the Five Members.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Black Rod|volume=4}}</ref><ref>John Joseph Bagley, A.

The [[London Underground]] also had an [[London Underground electric locomotives|electric locomotive]] built by [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] named after him. Used on the [[Metropolitan line]], No. 5 lasted along with other locomotives, until 1961.

'''John Hampden''', circa June 1595 –  24 June 1643, was an English landowner and politician, whose opposition to arbitrary taxes imposed by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] made him a national figure. An ally of [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] leader [[John Pym]], and cousin to [[Oliver Cromwell]], he was one of the [[Five Members]] whose attempted arrest in January 1642 sparked the [[First English Civil War]].

After war began in August 1642, Hampden raised an infantry regiment, and died of wounds received at the [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]] on 18 June 1643. His loss was considered a serious blow, largely because he was one of the few Parliamentary leaders able to hold the different factions together. 

His death in 1643 meant he avoided the bitter internal debates later in the war, the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, and establishment of [[The Protectorate]]. As a result, he is considered a less complex figure than either Cromwell, or even Pym; in 1841, his statue was erected in the [[Palace of Westminster]], to represent the Parliamentary cause.{{efn|The Royalist chosen was another moderate, [[Lucius_Cary,_2nd_Viscount_Falkland|Viscount Falkland]], killed at [[First_Battle_of_Newbury|Newbury]] three months later.}}    

A reputation for honest, principled, and patriotic opposition to arbitrary rule also made him a popular figure in [[North America]]. Prior to the 1774 [[American Revolution]], [[Benjamin_Franklin|Franklin]] and [[John_Adams|Adams]] were among those who referenced him to justify their cause.{{sfn|Jansson|2009|pp=11-12}}

==Biographical==
[[File:Gt Hampden Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great_and_Little_Hampden|Great Hampden church]], where Hampden and other family members were baptised, and later buried]]
John Hampden was born around June 1595, probably in [[London]], eldest son of William Hampden, (1570-1597), and Elizabeth Cromwell, (1574-1664); he had a younger brother, Richard, 1596 to 1659.{{sfn|Thompson|2010}}  

The Hampden family had been established in [[Buckinghamshire]] for many years; William was a lawyer, and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East_Looe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|East Looe]] in 1593.{{sfn|WJJ|1981}} He died in April 1597; his cousin, William Hampden of Ennington, was appointed executor, but became involved in a bitter legal dispute with Elizabeth.{{sfn|Russell|2008}}

In 1619, John married Elizabeth Symeon, and prior to her death in 1631, they had nine children. Seven survived into adulthood Ann (1616-1701), Elizabeth (1619-1643), John (1621-1642), William (died 1675), Ruth (1628-1687), Mary (1630-1689), and [[Richard_Hampden|Richard]] (1631-1695), [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under [[William III of England|William III]].<ref>{{cite web |title=John Hampden |url=https://www.geni.com/people/John-Hampden-Patriae-Pater/6000000003266399664 |website=Geni.com |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> In 1640, he married Letitia Knollys (1591-1666); they had no children.   

==Career==
In 1610, he graduated from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]; as legal training was then considered part of a gentleman's education, he attended the [[Inner Temple]] from 1613 to 1615. 

The Hampden family were [[Puritan]]s, a term then used for anyone who wanted to reform, or 'purify', the [[Church of England]]. It covered a variety of [[Christian_theology|doctrines]], of which [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] such as Hampden were the most prominent; it connected him to a network that included [[Richard_Knightley_(died_1639)|Sir Richard Knightley]], [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], and [[John_Preston_(priest)|John Preston]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} 

In 1621, Hampden was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]], a [[Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs|rotten borough]] in [[Cornwall]]. This is thought to have been through the influence of the local magnate, [[John_Arundell_(born_1576)|John Arundell]]; a good example of the complexity of the period, Arundell opposed [[Ship Money]] in 1636, but held [[Pendennis Castle]] for [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] until 1646.{{sfn|Duffin|Hunneyball|2010}}  
[[File:John Pym.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Pym]]; Hampden joined his attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]] in 1628]]
He financed the cost of restoring Parliamentary representation to [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]] in 1624, a seat he held until 1629. The [[2nd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1626 Parliament]] refused taxes without an agreement to [[Impeachment_in_the_United_Kingdom|impeach]] Charles' favourite, the [[George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], a military commander notorious for inefficiency, combined with extravagance; only his assassination in August 1628 prevented a second attempt.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} 

Rather than comply, Charles dissolved Parliament, and imposed a forced loan; over 70 individuals were jailed for not contributing, including Hampden's cousin, Sir Edmund Hampden.{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} Like many others, Hampden also refused to subscribe; and reducing the income from the loans. Charles was forced to call a [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]] in March 1627, which resulted in \"a preponderance of MPs opposed to the King\", including Selden, Coke, [[John Pym]] and a young [[Oliver Cromwell]].{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} released to attend the [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]], he supported [[John Pym]] and others in the Parliamentary attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} 

In the 17th century, religion and politics were considered interdependent; 'good government' required 'true religion', and alterations in one, implied alterations in the other.{{efn|This view was summarised by Hampden in the debate on the [[Petition of Right]]; \"Here is 1, an innovation of religion suspected; is it not high time to take it to heart and acquaint his Majesty? 2ly, alteration of government; can you forbear when it goes no less than the subversion of the whole state? 3ly, hemmed in with enemies; is it now a time to be silent, and not to show to his Majesty that a man that has so much power uses none of it to help us? If he be no papist, papists are friends and kindred to him.\"{{sfn|Keeler|Janssen Cole|1997|pp=121-122}}}} The two published [[sermons]], supporting the Caroline precepts of the [[divine right of kings]], and [[passive obedience]]; although censured for preaching against the established English constitution, Charles pardoned them, and made Sibthorpe a royal [[chaplain]].{{sfn|Little|2008|p=33}} 

and in 1629, he dissolved Parliament, initiating the period of [[Personal Rule]] that continued until 1640

In April 1640 he was elected MP for [[Buckinghamshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckinghamshire]] in the [[Short Parliament]] and was re-elected MP for Buckinghamshire for the [[Long Parliament]] in November 1640.<ref name=Willis>{{Cite Notitia Parliamentaria|converted=1|part=2|pages=229–239}}</ref> He sat until his death in 1643.

In the early days of his parliamentary career, he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], as in its later days he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Pym]] and to be commanded by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].



===Views on ship money===
Something of Hampden's fame no doubt is owing to the position which he took up as the opponent of [[ship money]].<ref>Gross, David (ed.) ''We Won't Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 9–16</ref> But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others as far as possible from the evil consequences of their actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.

===Committee work===
During these first parliaments Hampden did not, so far as we know, speak in public debate, but he was increasingly employed in [[committee]] work, for which he seems to have had a special aptitude. In 1626 he took an active part in the preparation of the charges against [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. In January 1627 he was bound over to answer at the council board for his refusal to pay the forced loan.  Later in the year he was committed to the gatehouse, and then sent into confinement in [[Hampshire]], from which he was liberated just before the meeting of the third parliament of the reign, in which he once more rendered useful but unobtrusive assistance to his leaders.

When the breach came in 1629 Hampden was found corresponding with the imprisoned Eliot, discussing with him the prospects of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Hampden was one of the persons to whom the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] granted land in [[Connecticut]] in what was then referred to as the [[Saybrook Colony]] and today as [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]]. While some claim there is no foundation but anecdote that Hampden attempted emigration to the colonies with Cromwell, others assert that Cromwell and other future architects of the English Civil War, including Hampden, may have been close to moving to America in the 1630s. The author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] points out that, \"Even in the 1770s, residents of [[Old Saybrook]] still talked about which prominent [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarian]] was to have had which town lot.\"<ref>Alfred A. Young, \"English Plebeian Culture an 18th Century American Radicalism\" in Margret Jacob and James Jacob, eds., \"The Origin of Anglo-American Radicalism\" 9New Jersey, Humanitarian Press International, 19910 Page 195,</ref>

It was not until 1637, however, that his resistance to the payment of ship money gained him wide fame. Seven out of the twelve judges sided against him, but the connection between the rights of property and the parliamentary system became firmly established in the popular mind. The tax had been justified, says Clarendon, who expresses his admiration at Hampden's \"rare temper and modesty\" at this crisis, \"upon such grounds and reasons as every standerby was able to swear was not law\" (''Hist''. i. 150,  vii. 82).

===Short Parliament===
In the Short Parliament that started on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House in the debate on 4 May in its opposition to the grant of twelve subsidies in return for the surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the [[Scotland|Scots]]. During the eventful months which followed, when [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford|Strafford]] was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his [[Bishops' Wars|Scottish war]], rumour has much to tell of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.

===Long Parliament===
In the [[Long Parliament]], though Hampden was by no means a frequent speaker, it is possible to trace his course with sufficient distinctness. His power consisted in his personal influence, and as a debater rather than as an orator.  \"He was not a man of many words,\" says Clarendon, \"and rarely began the discourse or made the first entrance upon any business that was assumed, but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a full debate and observed how the House was likely to be inclined, took up the argument and shortly and clearly and craftily so stated it that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired; and if he found he could not do that, he never was without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future\" (''Hist''. iii. 31). Unwearied in attendance upon committees, he was in all things ready to second Pym, whom he plainly regarded as his leader.

Hampden was one of the eight managers of Strafford's prosecution. Like Pym, he was in favour of the more legal and regular procedure by [[impeachment]] rather than by [[attainder]], which at the later stage was supported by the majority of the Commons; and through his influence a compromise was effected by which, while an attainder was subsequently adopted, Strafford's counsel were heard as in the case of an impeachment, and thus a serious breach between the two Houses, which threatened to cause the breakdown of the whole proceedings, was averted.

===Debate on episcopacy===
[[File:John Hampden Statue.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of John Hampden in Market Square, [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire]]

There was another point on which there was no agreement. A large minority wished to retain [[episcopacy]], and to keep the [[Book of Common Prayer]] unaltered, whilst the majority were at least willing to consider the question of abolishing the one and modifying the other. On this subject the parties which ultimately divided the House and the country itself were fully formed as early as 8 February 1641. It is enough to say that Hampden fully shared in the counsels of the opponents of episcopacy. It is not that he was a theoretical [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], but the [[bishop]]s had been in his days so fully engaged in the imposition of ceremonies regarded by the [[Puritans]] as verging on [[Papacy]] that it was difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate them from the cause in which they were embarked.  Closely connected with Hampden's distrust of the bishops was his distrust of monarchy as it then existed. The dispute about the church therefore soon attained the form of an attack upon [[monarchy]], and, when the majority of the [[House of Lords]] arrayed itself on the side of episcopacy and the Prayer Book, of an attack upon the House of Lords as well.

No serious importance therefore can be attached to the offers of advancement made from time to time to Hampden and his friends. Charles would gladly have given them office if they had been ready to desert their principles. Every day Hampden's conviction grew stronger that Charles would never surrender a position which he had taken up. In August 1641 Hampden was one of the four commissioners who attended Charles in Scotland, and the king's conduct there, connected with such events as the \"Incident\", must have proved to a man far less sagacious than Hampden that the time for compromise had gone by. He was therefore a warm supporter of the [[Grand Remonstrance]], and was marked out as one of the five impeached members, known thenceforth in history as the [[Five Members]] (the others being [[John Pym]], [[Arthur Haselrig]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]] and [[William Strode]]) whose attempted arrest brought at last the opposing parties into open collision. In the angry scene which arose on the proposal to print the Grand Remonstrance, it was Hampden's personal intervention which prevented an actual conflict, and it was after the impeachment had been attempted that Hampden laid down the two conditions under which resistance to the king became the duty of a good subject.  Those conditions were:
*an attack upon religion and
*an attack upon the fundamental laws.

There can be no doubt that Hampden fully believed that both those conditions were fulfilled at the opening of 1642.

==English Civil War==

When the [[English Civil War]] began, Hampden was appointed a member of the [[ Committee of Safety (England) #1642–1644 | Committee of Safety]], levied a [[regiment]] of Buckinghamshire men for the parliamentary cause, and in his capacity of deputy-lieutenant carried out the parliamentary [[Militia Ordinance]] in the county. In the earlier operations of the war he bore himself gallantly and well. He took no actual part in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] (23 October 1642). His troops in the rear,  however, arrested [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]'s charge at [[Kineton]], and he urged Essex to renew the attack here, and also after the disaster at [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]]. In the spring of 1643, Hampden's regiment took part in the [[siege of Reading]], which surrendered on 27 April. Although Essex intended to advance on the King's headquarters at Oxford, he remained at Reading because of widespread sickness in the army, a shortage of cavalry and to await a paymaster with funds to pay his troops. In early June 1643 he moved his army to Thame making his headquarters there on 10 June.

But it is not on his skill as a regimental officer that Hampden's fame rests. In war as in peace his distinction lay in his power of disentangling the essential part from the non-essential. In the previous constitutional struggle he had seen that the one thing necessary was to establish the supremacy of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  In the military struggle which followed he saw, as Cromwell saw afterwards, that the one thing necessary was to beat the enemy.  He protested at once against Essex's hesitations and compromises.  In the formation of the confederacy of the six associated counties, which was to supply a basis for Cromwell's operations, he took an active part.  His influence was felt alike in parliament and in the field but he was not in supreme command, and he had none of that impatience which often leads able men to fail in the execution of orders of which they disapprove.

===Death===
[[File:Hampden's monument, Chalgrove.jpg|thumb|Hampden's Monument, [[Chalgrove]]. A monument to John Hampden, who was mortally wounded 550 yards north of here in 1643 whilst fighting in the English Civil War on [[Battle of Chalgrove Field|Chalgrove Field]]]]

On the night of 17 June 1643, [[Prince Rupert]] sortied on a raid out of Oxford to capture the Parliamentarian army's paymaster, but while that failed, did succeed the next morning in overwhelming two of Essex's small garrison outposts at [[Postcombe]] and [[Chinnor]]. Hampden rode as a volunteer with 1,100 cavalry and dragoons commanded by Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] in pursuit of Rupert, with the intention of delaying him long enough for a larger force from Essex's main army to cut off his retreat. Rupert halted his own cavalry at [[Chalgrove]] to ambush the pursuit and allow 800 less mobile troops to escape via the ford of the [[River Thame]] at [[Chiselhampton]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]], Hampden was mortally wounded (some sources claim in the shoulder by two carbine balls, others by fragments from his own pistol exploding<ref>Britannica 1911 (article \"HAMPDEN, JOHN\") \"two carbine balls\". [http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/hampden.htm John Hampden, c.1595–1643] on the [http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/ British Civil Wars & Commonwealth website] \"possibly from his own pistol exploding\".</ref>) which shattered the bone and forced him to leave the field. He reached Thame, and his headquarters in the house of Ezekiel Browne (which became the Greyhound Inn).<ref name=\"A Short History of Thame School\"/>{{sfn|Nugent-Grenville|1854|p=361}} He survived six days, and died on 24 June.<ref>John Nichols \"The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 181\". p. 512. E. Cave, 1847</ref>

In the 1976 biography of Hampden written by Prof. John Adair,<ref name=\"adair\">Adair, John Eric, A life of John Hampden, the patriot (1594–1643), London: Macdonald and Jane's, 1976</ref> he concludes that it is most likely that Hampden died from an exploding pistol. [[Frederick Lee (priest)|Frederick George Lee]] in his book ''The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford'' (and available to view at the UK's National Archives or in the Royal Collection) lays out a version of this story.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/1070556/the-history-description-and-antiquities-of-the-prebendal-church-of-the-blessed|title=Lee, Frederick George – The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford ... / by Frederick George Lee.|website=www.royalcollection.org.uk}}</ref>

This account of his death was given by Sir Robert Pye his son-in-law...\"That in the action of Chalgrove Field, his pistol burst and shattered his hand in a terrible manner. He, however, rode off and got to his quarters but finding the wound mortal he sent for Sir Robert Pye then a colonel in the Parliamentary army – and who had married his eldest daughter – and told him that he looked on him in some degree accessory to his death as the pistols were present from him. Sir Robert assured him that he bought them in Paris from an eminent maker and proved them himself. It appeared on examining the other pistol that it was loaded to the muzzle with several supernumerary charges, owning to the carelessness of a servant. He was ordered to see that the pistols were loaded every morning which he did but without drawing the former charge.\" An exhumation of Hampden's body in 1828 showed that there was no damage to the shoulder but his 'right hand was shattered by the bursting of his pistol, and death probably ensued from [[tetanus|lockjaw]] arising out of extensive injury to the nervous system'.<ref>Frederick George Lee, The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford. Published 1883</ref>

It is also worth noting the following:
– in the book ''John Hampden'' by [[Frank Hansford-Miller]] published in 1976, it noted that his death was the result 'from the exploding of his own pistol in his own hand.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hansford-Miller |first1=Frank Herbert |title=John Hampden: an illustrated life of John Hampden, 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Shire Publications |isbn=978-0-85263-322-9 |language=en}}</ref> There has also been a scholarly analysis by the archivists at Hampden's school, Thame Grammar, who also conclude that he died accidentally from his own hand.<ref>[http://oldtamensians.info/current-news/page/4/ Old Tamensians]</ref>

Hampden's death so early in the war was a severe blow to the Parliamentarians.  During the preceding winter, Hampden had associated himself with John Pym's \"Middle Group\" in Parliament, which opposed any peace moves to the King except on favorable terms. At the same time he had worked to moderate the militancy of the parliamentary \"War Party\". Although Hampden was privately critical of Essex for not aggressively attacking after avoiding defeat at Edgehill and the standoff at [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], he remained publicly loyal and helped Essex resist the criticisms of the War Party. His death took with it a key link between the factions. Hearing of his death, the Member of Parliament [[Anthony Nicholl]] pronounced: \"Never Kingdom received a greater loss in one subject, never a man a truer and faithful friend.\"<ref>\"Selected Readings in English History\". p. 265. Ginn, 1913</ref>

Several schools use his name: a primary school in [[Wendover]] and another in Thame,  a [[grammar school]] in [[High Wycombe]] and a school in [[Hertfordshire]]. There is also a statue of him in [[Aylesbury]] town centre (illustrated above) pointing to his home in Great Hampden. [[Aylesbury Vale District Council]] use an image of the statue as their logo.

Outside of Britain, the towns of [[Hampden, Maryland]]; [[Hamden, Connecticut]]; [[Hampden, Maine]]; [[Hampden, Massachusetts]]; and [[Hampden, Newfoundland and Labrador]]; as well as the county of [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden]], [[Massachusetts]] are named in his honour. [[Hampden–Sydney College]] in [[Virginia]] is also named in honour of John Hampden and of [[Algernon Sydney]], another English patriot; and [[Mount Hampden]] in [[Zimbabwe]].

[[Thomas Gray]]'s poem \"[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]\" refers to the heroism of Hampden in the stanza:
\"Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast / The little tyrant of his fields withstood;/ Some mute inglorious [[John Milton|Milton]] here may rest, /  Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.\"<ref>\"The Works of Thomas Gray, Containing His Poems and Correspondence: With Memoirs of His Life and Writings, Volume 1\". p.120.

As one of the Five Members of the House of Commons, Hampden is commemorated at the [[State Opening of Parliament]] by the British monarch each year: the sovereign sits on the throne in the House of Lords and sends their messenger [[Black Rod]] to summons the Members of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to attend them. At his approach the doors to the Commons Chamber are slammed in his face, symbolising the refusal by the Commons to be entered by force by the monarch or one of the monarch's servants, and also its right to debate without the presence of the Queen's Representative.<ref name=\"State opening\"/> This is done in relation to the events of 1642, when King Charles I stormed into the House of Commons in an unsuccessful attempt to arrest the Five Members.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Black Rod|volume=4}}</ref><ref>John Joseph Bagley, A.

The [[London Underground]] also had an [[London Underground electric locomotives|electric locomotive]] built by [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] named after him. Used on the [[Metropolitan line]], No. 5 lasted along with other locomotives, until 1961. Painted a maroon colour, she is now one of only two of the original twenty locomotives to survive, and is kept on display in the [[London Transport Museum]].

'''John Hampden''', circa June 1595 –  24 June 1643, was an English landowner and politician, whose opposition to arbitrary taxes imposed by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] made him a national figure. An ally of [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] leader [[John Pym]], and cousin to [[Oliver Cromwell]], he was one of the [[Five Members]] whose attempted arrest in January 1642 sparked the [[First English Civil War]].

After war began in August 1642, Hampden raised an infantry regiment, and died of wounds received at the [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]] on 18 June 1643. His loss was considered a serious blow, largely because he was one of the few Parliamentary leaders able to hold the different factions together. 

His death in 1643 meant he avoided the bitter internal debates later in the war, the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, and establishment of [[The Protectorate]]. As a result, he is considered a less complex figure than either Cromwell, or even Pym; in 1841, his statue was erected in the [[Palace of Westminster]], to represent the Parliamentary cause.{{efn|The Royalist chosen was another moderate, [[Lucius_Cary,_2nd_Viscount_Falkland|Viscount Falkland]], killed at [[First_Battle_of_Newbury|Newbury]] three months later.}}    

A reputation for honest, principled, and patriotic opposition to arbitrary rule also made him a popular figure in [[North America]]. Prior to the 1774 [[American Revolution]], [[Benjamin_Franklin|Franklin]] and [[John_Adams|Adams]] were among those who referenced him to justify their cause.{{sfn|Jansson|2009|pp=11-12}}

==Biographical==
[[File:Gt Hampden Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great_and_Little_Hampden|Great Hampden church]], where Hampden and other family members were baptised, and later buried]]
John Hampden was born around June 1595, probably in [[London]], eldest son of William Hampden, (1570-1597), and Elizabeth Cromwell, (1574-1664); he had a younger brother, Richard, 1596 to 1659.{{sfn|Thompson|2010}}  

The Hampden family had been established in [[Buckinghamshire]] for many years; William was a lawyer, and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East_Looe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|East Looe]] in 1593.{{sfn|WJJ|1981}} He died in April 1597; his cousin, William Hampden of Ennington, was appointed executor, but became involved in a bitter legal dispute with Elizabeth.{{sfn|Russell|2008}}

In 1619, John married Elizabeth Symeon, and prior to her death in 1631, they had nine children. Seven survived into adulthood Ann (1616-1701), Elizabeth (1619-1643), John (1621-1642), William (died 1675), Ruth (1628-1687), Mary (1630-1689), and [[Richard_Hampden|Richard]] (1631-1695), [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under [[William III of England|William III]].<ref>{{cite web |title=John Hampden |url=https://www.geni.com/people/John-Hampden-Patriae-Pater/6000000003266399664 |website=Geni.com |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> In 1640, he married Letitia Knollys (1591-1666); they had no children.   

==Career==
In 1610, he graduated from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]; as legal training was then considered part of a gentleman's education, he attended the [[Inner Temple]] from 1613 to 1615. 

The Hampden family were [[Puritan]]s, a term then used for anyone who wanted to reform, or 'purify', the [[Church of England]]. It covered a variety of [[Christian_theology|doctrines]], of which [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] such as Hampden were the most prominent; it connected him to a network that included [[Richard_Knightley_(died_1639)|Sir Richard Knightley]], [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], and [[John_Preston_(priest)|John Preston]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} 

In 1621, Hampden was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]], a [[Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs|rotten borough]] in [[Cornwall]]. This is thought to have been through the influence of the local magnate, [[John_Arundell_(born_1576)|John Arundell]]; a good example of the complexity of the period, Arundell opposed [[Ship Money]] in 1636, but held [[Pendennis Castle]] for [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] until 1646.{{sfn|Duffin|Hunneyball|2010}}  
[[File:John Pym.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Pym]]; Hampden joined his attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]] in 1628]]
He financed the cost of restoring Parliamentary representation to [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]] in 1624, a seat he held until 1629. The [[2nd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1626 Parliament]] refused taxes without an agreement to [[Impeachment_in_the_United_Kingdom|impeach]] Charles' favourite, the [[George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], a military commander notorious for inefficiency, combined with extravagance; only his assassination in August 1628 prevented a second attempt.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} 

Rather than comply, Charles dissolved Parliament, and imposed a forced loan; over 70 individuals were jailed for not contributing, including Hampden's cousin, Sir Edmund Hampden.{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} Like many others, Hampden also refused to subscribe; and reducing the income from the loans. Charles was forced to call a [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]] in March 1627, which resulted in \"a preponderance of MPs opposed to the King\", including Selden, Coke, [[John Pym]] and a young [[Oliver Cromwell]].{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} released to attend the [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]], he supported [[John Pym]] and others in the Parliamentary attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} 

In the 17th century, religion and politics were considered interdependent; 'good government' required 'true religion', and alterations in one, implied alterations in the other.{{efn|This view was summarised by Hampden in the debate on the [[Petition of Right]]; \"Here is 1, an innovation of religion suspected; is it not high time to take it to heart and acquaint his Majesty? 2ly, alteration of government; can you forbear when it goes no less than the subversion of the whole state? 3ly, hemmed in with enemies; is it now a time to be silent, and not to show to his Majesty that a man that has so much power uses none of it to help us? If he be no papist, papists are friends and kindred to him.\"{{sfn|Keeler, Janssen Cole|1997|pp=121-122}}}} The two published [[sermons]], supporting the Caroline precepts of the [[divine right of kings]], and [[passive obedience]]; although censured for preaching against the established English constitution, Charles pardoned them, and made Sibthorpe a royal [[chaplain]].{{sfn|Little|2008|p=33}} 

and in 1629, he dissolved Parliament, initiating the period of [[Personal Rule]] that continued until 1640

In April 1640 he was elected MP for [[Buckinghamshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckinghamshire]] in the [[Short Parliament]] and was re-elected MP for Buckinghamshire for the [[Long Parliament]] in November 1640.<ref name=Willis>{{Cite Notitia Parliamentaria|converted=1|part=2|pages=229–239}}</ref> He sat until his death in 1643.

In the early days of his parliamentary career, he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], as in its later days he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Pym]] and to be commanded by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].



===Views on ship money===
Something of Hampden's fame no doubt is owing to the position which he took up as the opponent of [[ship money]].<ref>Gross, David (ed.) ''We Won't Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 9–16</ref> But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others as far as possible from the evil consequences of their actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.

===Committee work===
During these first parliaments Hampden did not, so far as we know, speak in public debate, but he was increasingly employed in [[committee]] work, for which he seems to have had a special aptitude. In 1626 he took an active part in the preparation of the charges against [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. In January 1627 he was bound over to answer at the council board for his refusal to pay the forced loan.  Later in the year he was committed to the gatehouse, and then sent into confinement in [[Hampshire]], from which he was liberated just before the meeting of the third parliament of the reign, in which he once more rendered useful but unobtrusive assistance to his leaders.

When the breach came in 1629 Hampden was found corresponding with the imprisoned Eliot, discussing with him the prospects of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Hampden was one of the persons to whom the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] granted land in [[Connecticut]] in what was then referred to as the [[Saybrook Colony]] and today as [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]]. While some claim there is no foundation but anecdote that Hampden attempted emigration to the colonies with Cromwell, others assert that Cromwell and other future architects of the English Civil War, including Hampden, may have been close to moving to America in the 1630s. The author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] points out that, \"Even in the 1770s, residents of [[Old Saybrook]] still talked about which prominent [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarian]] was to have had which town lot.\"<ref>Alfred A. Young, \"English Plebeian Culture an 18th Century American Radicalism\" in Margret Jacob and James Jacob, eds., \"The Origin of Anglo-American Radicalism\" 9New Jersey, Humanitarian Press International, 19910 Page 195,</ref>

It was not until 1637, however, that his resistance to the payment of ship money gained him wide fame. Seven out of the twelve judges sided against him, but the connection between the rights of property and the parliamentary system became firmly established in the popular mind. The tax had been justified, says Clarendon, who expresses his admiration at Hampden's \"rare temper and modesty\" at this crisis, \"upon such grounds and reasons as every standerby was able to swear was not law\" (''Hist''. i. 150,  vii. 82).

===Short Parliament===
In the Short Parliament that started on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House in the debate on 4 May in its opposition to the grant of twelve subsidies in return for the surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the [[Scotland|Scots]]. During the eventful months which followed, when [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford|Strafford]] was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his [[Bishops' Wars|Scottish war]], rumour has much to tell of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.

===Long Parliament===
In the [[Long Parliament]], though Hampden was by no means a frequent speaker, it is possible to trace his course with sufficient distinctness. His power consisted in his personal influence, and as a debater rather than as an orator.  \"He was not a man of many words,\" says Clarendon, \"and rarely began the discourse or made the first entrance upon any business that was assumed, but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a full debate and observed how the House was likely to be inclined, took up the argument and shortly and clearly and craftily so stated it that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired; and if he found he could not do that, he never was without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future\" (''Hist''. iii. 31). Unwearied in attendance upon committees, he was in all things ready to second Pym, whom he plainly regarded as his leader.

Hampden was one of the eight managers of Strafford's prosecution. Like Pym, he was in favour of the more legal and regular procedure by [[impeachment]] rather than by [[attainder]], which at the later stage was supported by the majority of the Commons; and through his influence a compromise was effected by which, while an attainder was subsequently adopted, Strafford's counsel were heard as in the case of an impeachment, and thus a serious breach between the two Houses, which threatened to cause the breakdown of the whole proceedings, was averted.

===Debate on episcopacy===
[[File:John Hampden Statue.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of John Hampden in Market Square, [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire]]

There was another point on which there was no agreement. A large minority wished to retain [[episcopacy]], and to keep the [[Book of Common Prayer]] unaltered, whilst the majority were at least willing to consider the question of abolishing the one and modifying the other. On this subject the parties which ultimately divided the House and the country itself were fully formed as early as 8 February 1641. It is enough to say that Hampden fully shared in the counsels of the opponents of episcopacy. It is not that he was a theoretical [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], but the [[bishop]]s had been in his days so fully engaged in the imposition of ceremonies regarded by the [[Puritans]] as verging on [[Papacy]] that it was difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate them from the cause in which they were embarked.  Closely connected with Hampden's distrust of the bishops was his distrust of monarchy as it then existed. The dispute about the church therefore soon attained the form of an attack upon [[monarchy]], and, when the majority of the [[House of Lords]] arrayed itself on the side of episcopacy and the Prayer Book, of an attack upon the House of Lords as well.

No serious importance therefore can be attached to the offers of advancement made from time to time to Hampden and his friends. Charles would gladly have given them office if they had been ready to desert their principles. Every day Hampden's conviction grew stronger that Charles would never surrender a position which he had taken up. In August 1641 Hampden was one of the four commissioners who attended Charles in Scotland, and the king's conduct there, connected with such events as the \"Incident\", must have proved to a man far less sagacious than Hampden that the time for compromise had gone by. He was therefore a warm supporter of the [[Grand Remonstrance]], and was marked out as one of the five impeached members, known thenceforth in history as the [[Five Members]] (the others being [[John Pym]], [[Arthur Haselrig]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]] and [[William Strode]]) whose attempted arrest brought at last the opposing parties into open collision. In the angry scene which arose on the proposal to print the Grand Remonstrance, it was Hampden's personal intervention which prevented an actual conflict, and it was after the impeachment had been attempted that Hampden laid down the two conditions under which resistance to the king became the duty of a good subject.  Those conditions were:
*an attack upon religion and
*an attack upon the fundamental laws.

There can be no doubt that Hampden fully believed that both those conditions were fulfilled at the opening of 1642.

==English Civil War==

When the [[English Civil War]] began, Hampden was appointed a member of the [[ Committee of Safety (England) #1642–1644 | Committee of Safety]], levied a [[regiment]] of Buckinghamshire men for the parliamentary cause, and in his capacity of deputy-lieutenant carried out the parliamentary [[Militia Ordinance]] in the county. In the earlier operations of the war he bore himself gallantly and well. He took no actual part in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] (23 October 1642). His troops in the rear,  however, arrested [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]'s charge at [[Kineton]], and he urged Essex to renew the attack here, and also after the disaster at [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]]. In the spring of 1643, Hampden's regiment took part in the [[siege of Reading]], which surrendered on 27 April. Although Essex intended to advance on the King's headquarters at Oxford, he remained at Reading because of widespread sickness in the army, a shortage of cavalry and to await a paymaster with funds to pay his troops. In early June 1643 he moved his army to Thame making his headquarters there on 10 June.

But it is not on his skill as a regimental officer that Hampden's fame rests. In war as in peace his distinction lay in his power of disentangling the essential part from the non-essential. In the previous constitutional struggle he had seen that the one thing necessary was to establish the supremacy of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  In the military struggle which followed he saw, as Cromwell saw afterwards, that the one thing necessary was to beat the enemy.  He protested at once against Essex's hesitations and compromises.  In the formation of the confederacy of the six associated counties, which was to supply a basis for Cromwell's operations, he took an active part.  His influence was felt alike in parliament and in the field but he was not in supreme command, and he had none of that impatience which often leads able men to fail in the execution of orders of which they disapprove.

===Death===
[[File:Hampden's monument, Chalgrove.jpg|thumb|Hampden's Monument, [[Chalgrove]]. A monument to John Hampden, who was mortally wounded 550 yards north of here in 1643 whilst fighting in the English Civil War on [[Battle of Chalgrove Field|Chalgrove Field]]]]

On the night of 17 June 1643, [[Prince Rupert]] sortied on a raid out of Oxford to capture the Parliamentarian army's paymaster, but while that failed, did succeed the next morning in overwhelming two of Essex's small garrison outposts at [[Postcombe]] and [[Chinnor]]. Hampden rode as a volunteer with 1,100 cavalry and dragoons commanded by Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] in pursuit of Rupert, with the intention of delaying him long enough for a larger force from Essex's main army to cut off his retreat. Rupert halted his own cavalry at [[Chalgrove]] to ambush the pursuit and allow 800 less mobile troops to escape via the ford of the [[River Thame]] at [[Chiselhampton]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]], Hampden was mortally wounded (some sources claim in the shoulder by two carbine balls, others by fragments from his own pistol exploding<ref>Britannica 1911 (article \"HAMPDEN, JOHN\") \"two carbine balls\". [http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/hampden.htm John Hampden, c.1595–1643] on the [http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/ British Civil Wars & Commonwealth website] \"possibly from his own pistol exploding\".</ref>) which shattered the bone and forced him to leave the field. He reached Thame, and his headquarters in the house of Ezekiel Browne (which became the Greyhound Inn).<ref name=\"A Short History of Thame School\"/>{{sfn|Nugent-Grenville|1854|p=361}} He survived six days, and died on 24 June.<ref>John Nichols \"The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 181\". p. 512. E. Cave, 1847</ref>

In the 1976 biography of Hampden written by Prof. John Adair,<ref name=\"adair\">Adair, John Eric, A life of John Hampden, the patriot (1594–1643), London: Macdonald and Jane's, 1976</ref> he concludes that it is most likely that Hampden died from an exploding pistol. [[Frederick Lee (priest)|Frederick George Lee]] in his book ''The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford'' (and available to view at the UK's National Archives or in the Royal Collection) lays out a version of this story.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/1070556/the-history-description-and-antiquities-of-the-prebendal-church-of-the-blessed|title=Lee, Frederick George – The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford ... / by Frederick George Lee.|website=www.royalcollection.org.uk}}</ref>

This account of his death was given by Sir Robert Pye his son-in-law...\"That in the action of Chalgrove Field, his pistol burst and shattered his hand in a terrible manner. He, however, rode off and got to his quarters but finding the wound mortal he sent for Sir Robert Pye then a colonel in the Parliamentary army – and who had married his eldest daughter – and told him that he looked on him in some degree accessory to his death as the pistols were present from him. Sir Robert assured him that he bought them in Paris from an eminent maker and proved them himself. It appeared on examining the other pistol that it was loaded to the muzzle with several supernumerary charges, owning to the carelessness of a servant. He was ordered to see that the pistols were loaded every morning which he did but without drawing the former charge.\" An exhumation of Hampden's body in 1828 showed that there was no damage to the shoulder but his 'right hand was shattered by the bursting of his pistol, and death probably ensued from [[tetanus|lockjaw]] arising out of extensive injury to the nervous system'.<ref>Frederick George Lee, The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford. Published 1883</ref>

It is also worth noting the following:
– in the book ''John Hampden'' by [[Frank Hansford-Miller]] published in 1976, it noted that his death was the result 'from the exploding of his own pistol in his own hand.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hansford-Miller |first1=Frank Herbert |title=John Hampden: an illustrated life of John Hampden, 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Shire Publications |isbn=978-0-85263-322-9 |language=en}}</ref> There has also been a scholarly analysis by the archivists at Hampden's school, Thame Grammar, who also conclude that he died accidentally from his own hand.<ref>[http://oldtamensians.info/current-news/page/4/ Old Tamensians]</ref>

Hampden's death so early in the war was a severe blow to the Parliamentarians.  During the preceding winter, Hampden had associated himself with John Pym's \"Middle Group\" in Parliament, which opposed any peace moves to the King except on favorable terms. At the same time he had worked to moderate the militancy of the parliamentary \"War Party\". Although Hampden was privately critical of Essex for not aggressively attacking after avoiding defeat at Edgehill and the standoff at [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], he remained publicly loyal and helped Essex resist the criticisms of the War Party. His death took with it a key link between the factions. Hearing of his death, the Member of Parliament [[Anthony Nicholl]] pronounced: \"Never Kingdom received a greater loss in one subject, never a man a truer and faithful friend.\"<ref>\"Selected Readings in English History\". p. 265. Ginn, 1913</ref>

==Marriages & progeny==
Hampden married twice:

Hampden is immortalised in St Stephen's Hall in the Palace of Westminster, where he and other notable Parliamentarians look on at visitors to the UK Parliament.<ref name=ssstat>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/architecture/palace-s-interiors/st-stephen-s-hall/|title=St Stephen's Hall|website=UK Parliament}}</ref>  In Britain diverse establishments are named after him, ranging from [[Hampden Park]], the home ground of [[Queen's Park F.C.]] and the [[Scotland national football team]], to an older persons' mental health unit at [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]]. Several schools use his name: a primary school in [[Wendover]] and another in Thame,  a [[grammar school]] in [[High Wycombe]] and a school in [[Hertfordshire]]. There is also a statue of him in [[Aylesbury]] town centre (illustrated above) pointing to his home in Great Hampden. [[Aylesbury Vale District Council]] use an image of the statue as their logo.

Outside of Britain, the towns of [[Hampden, Maryland]]; [[Hamden, Connecticut]]; [[Hampden, Maine]]; [[Hampden, Massachusetts]]; and [[Hampden, Newfoundland and Labrador]]; as well as the county of [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden]], [[Massachusetts]] are named in his honour. [[Hampden–Sydney College]] in [[Virginia]] is also named in honour of John Hampden and of [[Algernon Sydney]], another English patriot; and [[Mount Hampden]] in [[Zimbabwe]].

[[Thomas Gray]]'s poem \"[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]\" refers to the heroism of Hampden in the stanza:
\"Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast / The little tyrant of his fields withstood;/ Some mute inglorious [[John Milton|Milton]] here may rest, /  Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.\"<ref>\"The Works of Thomas Gray, Containing His Poems and Correspondence: With Memoirs of His Life and Writings, Volume 1\". p.120.

As one of the Five Members of the House of Commons, Hampden is commemorated at the [[State Opening of Parliament]] by the British monarch each year: the sovereign sits on the throne in the House of Lords and sends their messenger [[Black Rod]] to summons the Members of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to attend them. At his approach the doors to the Commons Chamber are slammed in his face, symbolising the refusal by the Commons to be entered by force by the monarch or one of the monarch's servants, and also its right to debate without the presence of the Queen's Representative.<ref name=\"State opening\"/> This is done in relation to the events of 1642, when King Charles I stormed into the House of Commons in an unsuccessful attempt to arrest the Five Members.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Black Rod|volume=4}}</ref><ref>John Joseph Bagley, A.

'''John Hampden''', circa June 1595 –  24 June 1643, was an English landowner and politician, whose opposition to arbitrary taxes imposed by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] made him a national figure. An ally of [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] leader [[John Pym]], and cousin to [[Oliver Cromwell]], he was one of the [[Five Members]] whose attempted arrest in January 1642 sparked the [[First English Civil War]].

After war began in August 1642, Hampden raised an infantry regiment, and died of wounds received at the [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]] on 18 June 1643. His loss was considered a serious blow, largely because he was one of the few Parliamentary leaders able to hold the different factions together. 

His death in 1643 meant he avoided the bitter internal debates later in the war, the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, and establishment of [[The Protectorate]]. As a result, he is considered a less complex figure than either Cromwell, or even Pym; in 1841, his statue was erected in the [[Palace of Westminster]], to represent the Parliamentary cause.{{efn|The Royalist chosen was another moderate, [[Lucius_Cary,_2nd_Viscount_Falkland|Viscount Falkland]], killed at [[First_Battle_of_Newbury|Newbury]] three months later.}}    

A reputation for honest, principled, and patriotic opposition to arbitrary rule also made him a popular figure in [[North America]]. Prior to the 1774 [[American Revolution]], [[Benjamin_Franklin|Franklin]] and [[John_Adams|Adams]] were among those who referenced him to justify their cause.{{sfn|Jansson|2009|pp=11-12}}

==Biographical==
[[File:Gt Hampden Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great_and_Little_Hampden|Great Hampden church]], where Hampden and other family members were baptised, and later buried]]
John Hampden was born around June 1595, probably in [[London]], eldest son of William Hampden, (1570-1597), and Elizabeth Cromwell, (1574-1664); he had a younger brother, Richard, 1596 to 1659.{{sfn|Thompson|2010}}  

The Hampden family had been established in [[Buckinghamshire]] for many years; William was a lawyer, and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East_Looe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|East Looe]] in 1593.{{sfn|WJJ|1981}} He died in April 1597; his cousin, William Hampden of Ennington, was appointed executor, but became involved in a bitter legal dispute with Elizabeth.{{sfn|Russell|2008}}

In 1619, John married Elizabeth Symeon, and prior to her death in 1631, they had nine children. Seven survived into adulthood Ann (1616-1701), Elizabeth (1619-1643), John (1621-1642), William (died 1675), Ruth (1628-1687), Mary (1630-1689), and [[Richard_Hampden|Richard]] (1631-1695), [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under [[William III of England|William III]].<ref>{{cite web |title=John Hampden |url=https://www.geni.com/people/John-Hampden-Patriae-Pater/6000000003266399664 |website=Geni.com |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> In 1640, he married Letitia Knollys (1591-1666); they had no children.   

==Career==
In 1610, he graduated from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]; as legal training was then considered part of a gentleman's education, he attended the [[Inner Temple]] from 1613 to 1615. 

The Hampden family were [[Puritan]]s, a term then used for anyone who wanted to reform, or 'purify', the [[Church of England]]. It covered a variety of [[Christian_theology|doctrines]], of which [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] such as Hampden were the most prominent; it connected him to a network that included [[Richard_Knightley_(died_1639)|Sir Richard Knightley]], [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], and [[John_Preston_(priest)|John Preston]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} 

In 1621, Hampden was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]], a [[Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs|rotten borough]] in [[Cornwall]]. This is thought to have been through the influence of the local magnate, [[John_Arundell_(born_1576)|John Arundell]]; a good example of the complexity of the period, Arundell opposed [[Ship Money]] in 1636, but held [[Pendennis Castle]] for [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] until 1646.{{sfn|Duffin, Hunneyball|2010}}  
[[File:John Pym.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Pym]]; Hampden joined his attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]] in 1628]]
He financed the cost of restoring Parliamentary representation to [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]] in 1624, a seat he held until 1629. The [[2nd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1626 Parliament]] refused taxes without an agreement to [[Impeachment_in_the_United_Kingdom|impeach]] Charles' favourite, the [[George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], a military commander notorious for inefficiency, combined with extravagance; only his assassination in August 1628 prevented a second attempt.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} 

Rather than comply, Charles dissolved Parliament, and imposed a forced loan; over 70 individuals were jailed for not contributing, including Hampden's cousin, Sir Edmund Hampden.{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} Like many others, Hampden also refused to subscribe; and reducing the income from the loans. Charles was forced to call a [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]] in March 1627, which resulted in \"a preponderance of MPs opposed to the King\", including Selden, Coke, [[John Pym]] and a young [[Oliver Cromwell]].{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} released to attend the [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]], he supported [[John Pym]] and others in the Parliamentary attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} 

In the 17th century, religion and politics were considered interdependent; 'good government' required 'true religion', and alterations in one, implied alterations in the other.{{efn|This view was summarised by Hampden in the debate on the [[Petition of Right]]; \"Here is 1, an innovation of religion suspected; is it not high time to take it to heart and acquaint his Majesty? 2ly, alteration of government; can you forbear when it goes no less than the subversion of the whole state? 3ly, hemmed in with enemies; is it now a time to be silent, and not to show to his Majesty that a man that has so much power uses none of it to help us? If he be no papist, papists are friends and kindred to him.\"{{sfn|Keeler, Janssen Cole|1997|pp=121-122}}}} The two published [[sermons]], supporting the Caroline precepts of the [[divine right of kings]], and [[passive obedience]]; although censured for preaching against the established English constitution, Charles pardoned them, and made Sibthorpe a royal [[chaplain]].{{sfn|Little|2008|p=33}} 

and in 1629, he dissolved Parliament, initiating the period of [[Personal Rule]] that continued until 1640

In April 1640 he was elected MP for [[Buckinghamshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckinghamshire]] in the [[Short Parliament]] and was re-elected MP for Buckinghamshire for the [[Long Parliament]] in November 1640.<ref name=Willis>{{Cite Notitia Parliamentaria|converted=1|part=2|pages=229–239}}</ref> He sat until his death in 1643.

In the early days of his parliamentary career, he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], as in its later days he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Pym]] and to be commanded by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].



===Views on ship money===
Something of Hampden's fame no doubt is owing to the position which he took up as the opponent of [[ship money]].<ref>Gross, David (ed.) ''We Won't Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 9–16</ref> But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others as far as possible from the evil consequences of their actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.

===Committee work===
During these first parliaments Hampden did not, so far as we know, speak in public debate, but he was increasingly employed in [[committee]] work, for which he seems to have had a special aptitude. In 1626 he took an active part in the preparation of the charges against [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. In January 1627 he was bound over to answer at the council board for his refusal to pay the forced loan.  Later in the year he was committed to the gatehouse, and then sent into confinement in [[Hampshire]], from which he was liberated just before the meeting of the third parliament of the reign, in which he once more rendered useful but unobtrusive assistance to his leaders.

When the breach came in 1629 Hampden was found corresponding with the imprisoned Eliot, discussing with him the prospects of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Hampden was one of the persons to whom the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] granted land in [[Connecticut]] in what was then referred to as the [[Saybrook Colony]] and today as [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]]. While some claim there is no foundation but anecdote that Hampden attempted emigration to the colonies with Cromwell, others assert that Cromwell and other future architects of the English Civil War, including Hampden, may have been close to moving to America in the 1630s. The author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] points out that, \"Even in the 1770s, residents of [[Old Saybrook]] still talked about which prominent [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarian]] was to have had which town lot.\"<ref>Alfred A. Young, \"English Plebeian Culture an 18th Century American Radicalism\" in Margret Jacob and James Jacob, eds., \"The Origin of Anglo-American Radicalism\" 9New Jersey, Humanitarian Press International, 19910 Page 195,</ref>

It was not until 1637, however, that his resistance to the payment of ship money gained him wide fame. Seven out of the twelve judges sided against him, but the connection between the rights of property and the parliamentary system became firmly established in the popular mind. The tax had been justified, says Clarendon, who expresses his admiration at Hampden's \"rare temper and modesty\" at this crisis, \"upon such grounds and reasons as every standerby was able to swear was not law\" (''Hist''. i. 150,  vii. 82).

===Short Parliament===
In the Short Parliament that started on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House in the debate on 4 May in its opposition to the grant of twelve subsidies in return for the surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the [[Scotland|Scots]]. During the eventful months which followed, when [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford|Strafford]] was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his [[Bishops' Wars|Scottish war]], rumour has much to tell of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.

===Long Parliament===
In the [[Long Parliament]], though Hampden was by no means a frequent speaker, it is possible to trace his course with sufficient distinctness. His power consisted in his personal influence, and as a debater rather than as an orator.  \"He was not a man of many words,\" says Clarendon, \"and rarely began the discourse or made the first entrance upon any business that was assumed, but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a full debate and observed how the House was likely to be inclined, took up the argument and shortly and clearly and craftily so stated it that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired; and if he found he could not do that, he never was without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future\" (''Hist''. iii. 31). Unwearied in attendance upon committees, he was in all things ready to second Pym, whom he plainly regarded as his leader.

Hampden was one of the eight managers of Strafford's prosecution. Like Pym, he was in favour of the more legal and regular procedure by [[impeachment]] rather than by [[attainder]], which at the later stage was supported by the majority of the Commons; and through his influence a compromise was effected by which, while an attainder was subsequently adopted, Strafford's counsel were heard as in the case of an impeachment, and thus a serious breach between the two Houses, which threatened to cause the breakdown of the whole proceedings, was averted.

===Debate on episcopacy===
[[File:John Hampden Statue.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of John Hampden in Market Square, [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire]]

There was another point on which there was no agreement. A large minority wished to retain [[episcopacy]], and to keep the [[Book of Common Prayer]] unaltered, whilst the majority were at least willing to consider the question of abolishing the one and modifying the other. On this subject the parties which ultimately divided the House and the country itself were fully formed as early as 8 February 1641. It is enough to say that Hampden fully shared in the counsels of the opponents of episcopacy. It is not that he was a theoretical [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], but the [[bishop]]s had been in his days so fully engaged in the imposition of ceremonies regarded by the [[Puritans]] as verging on [[Papacy]] that it was difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate them from the cause in which they were embarked.  Closely connected with Hampden's distrust of the bishops was his distrust of monarchy as it then existed. The dispute about the church therefore soon attained the form of an attack upon [[monarchy]], and, when the majority of the [[House of Lords]] arrayed itself on the side of episcopacy and the Prayer Book, of an attack upon the House of Lords as well.

No serious importance therefore can be attached to the offers of advancement made from time to time to Hampden and his friends. Charles would gladly have given them office if they had been ready to desert their principles. Every day Hampden's conviction grew stronger that Charles would never surrender a position which he had taken up. In August 1641 Hampden was one of the four commissioners who attended Charles in Scotland, and the king's conduct there, connected with such events as the \"Incident\", must have proved to a man far less sagacious than Hampden that the time for compromise had gone by. He was therefore a warm supporter of the [[Grand Remonstrance]], and was marked out as one of the five impeached members, known thenceforth in history as the [[Five Members]] (the others being [[John Pym]], [[Arthur Haselrig]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]] and [[William Strode]]) whose attempted arrest brought at last the opposing parties into open collision. In the angry scene which arose on the proposal to print the Grand Remonstrance, it was Hampden's personal intervention which prevented an actual conflict, and it was after the impeachment had been attempted that Hampden laid down the two conditions under which resistance to the king became the duty of a good subject.  Those conditions were:
*an attack upon religion and
*an attack upon the fundamental laws.

There can be no doubt that Hampden fully believed that both those conditions were fulfilled at the opening of 1642.

==English Civil War==

When the [[English Civil War]] began, Hampden was appointed a member of the [[ Committee of Safety (England) #1642–1644 | Committee of Safety]], levied a [[regiment]] of Buckinghamshire men for the parliamentary cause, and in his capacity of deputy-lieutenant carried out the parliamentary [[Militia Ordinance]] in the county. In the earlier operations of the war he bore himself gallantly and well. He took no actual part in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] (23 October 1642). His troops in the rear,  however, arrested [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]'s charge at [[Kineton]], and he urged Essex to renew the attack here, and also after the disaster at [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]]. In the spring of 1643, Hampden's regiment took part in the [[siege of Reading]], which surrendered on 27 April. Although Essex intended to advance on the King's headquarters at Oxford, he remained at Reading because of widespread sickness in the army, a shortage of cavalry and to await a paymaster with funds to pay his troops. In early June 1643 he moved his army to Thame making his headquarters there on 10 June.

But it is not on his skill as a regimental officer that Hampden's fame rests. In war as in peace his distinction lay in his power of disentangling the essential part from the non-essential. In the previous constitutional struggle he had seen that the one thing necessary was to establish the supremacy of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  In the military struggle which followed he saw, as Cromwell saw afterwards, that the one thing necessary was to beat the enemy.  He protested at once against Essex's hesitations and compromises.  In the formation of the confederacy of the six associated counties, which was to supply a basis for Cromwell's operations, he took an active part.  His influence was felt alike in parliament and in the field but he was not in supreme command, and he had none of that impatience which often leads able men to fail in the execution of orders of which they disapprove.

===Death===
[[File:Hampden's monument, Chalgrove.jpg|thumb|Hampden's Monument, [[Chalgrove]]. A monument to John Hampden, who was mortally wounded 550 yards north of here in 1643 whilst fighting in the English Civil War on [[Battle of Chalgrove Field|Chalgrove Field]]]]

On the night of 17 June 1643, [[Prince Rupert]] sortied on a raid out of Oxford to capture the Parliamentarian army's paymaster, but while that failed, did succeed the next morning in overwhelming two of Essex's small garrison outposts at [[Postcombe]] and [[Chinnor]]. Hampden rode as a volunteer with 1,100 cavalry and dragoons commanded by Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] in pursuit of Rupert, with the intention of delaying him long enough for a larger force from Essex's main army to cut off his retreat. Rupert halted his own cavalry at [[Chalgrove]] to ambush the pursuit and allow 800 less mobile troops to escape via the ford of the [[River Thame]] at [[Chiselhampton]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]], Hampden was mortally wounded (some sources claim in the shoulder by two carbine balls, others by fragments from his own pistol exploding<ref>Britannica 1911 (article \"HAMPDEN, JOHN\") \"two carbine balls\". [http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/hampden.htm John Hampden, c.1595–1643] on the [http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/ British Civil Wars & Commonwealth website] \"possibly from his own pistol exploding\".</ref>) which shattered the bone and forced him to leave the field. He reached Thame, and his headquarters in the house of Ezekiel Browne (which became the Greyhound Inn).<ref name=\"A Short History of Thame School\"/>{{sfn|Nugent-Grenville|1854|p=361}} He survived six days, and died on 24 June.<ref>John Nichols \"The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 181\". p. 512. E. Cave, 1847</ref>

In the 1976 biography of Hampden written by Prof. John Adair,<ref name=\"adair\">Adair, John Eric, A life of John Hampden, the patriot (1594–1643), London: Macdonald and Jane's, 1976</ref> he concludes that it is most likely that Hampden died from an exploding pistol. [[Frederick Lee (priest)|Frederick George Lee]] in his book ''The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford'' (and available to view at the UK's National Archives or in the Royal Collection) lays out a version of this story.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/1070556/the-history-description-and-antiquities-of-the-prebendal-church-of-the-blessed|title=Lee, Frederick George – The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford ... / by Frederick George Lee.|website=www.royalcollection.org.uk}}</ref>

This account of his death was given by Sir Robert Pye his son-in-law...\"That in the action of Chalgrove Field, his pistol burst and shattered his hand in a terrible manner. He, however, rode off and got to his quarters but finding the wound mortal he sent for Sir Robert Pye then a colonel in the Parliamentary army – and who had married his eldest daughter – and told him that he looked on him in some degree accessory to his death as the pistols were present from him. Sir Robert assured him that he bought them in Paris from an eminent maker and proved them himself. It appeared on examining the other pistol that it was loaded to the muzzle with several supernumerary charges, owning to the carelessness of a servant. He was ordered to see that the pistols were loaded every morning which he did but without drawing the former charge.\" An exhumation of Hampden's body in 1828 showed that there was no damage to the shoulder but his 'right hand was shattered by the bursting of his pistol, and death probably ensued from [[tetanus|lockjaw]] arising out of extensive injury to the nervous system'.<ref>Frederick George Lee, The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford. Published 1883</ref>

It is also worth noting the following:
– in the book ''John Hampden'' by [[Frank Hansford-Miller]] published in 1976, it noted that his death was the result 'from the exploding of his own pistol in his own hand.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hansford-Miller |first1=Frank Herbert |title=John Hampden: an illustrated life of John Hampden, 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Shire Publications |isbn=978-0-85263-322-9 |language=en}}</ref> There has also been a scholarly analysis by the archivists at Hampden's school, Thame Grammar, who also conclude that he died accidentally from his own hand.<ref>[http://oldtamensians.info/current-news/page/4/ Old Tamensians]</ref>

Hampden's death so early in the war was a severe blow to the Parliamentarians.  During the preceding winter, Hampden had associated himself with John Pym's \"Middle Group\" in Parliament, which opposed any peace moves to the King except on favorable terms. At the same time he had worked to moderate the militancy of the parliamentary \"War Party\". Although Hampden was privately critical of Essex for not aggressively attacking after avoiding defeat at Edgehill and the standoff at [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], he remained publicly loyal and helped Essex resist the criticisms of the War Party. His death took with it a key link between the factions. Hearing of his death, the Member of Parliament [[Anthony Nicholl]] pronounced: \"Never Kingdom received a greater loss in one subject, never a man a truer and faithful friend.\"<ref>\"Selected Readings in English History\". p. 265. Ginn, 1913</ref>

Several schools use his name: a primary school in [[Wendover]] and another in Thame,  a [[grammar school]] in [[High Wycombe]] and a school in [[Hertfordshire]]. There is also a statue of him in [[Aylesbury]] town centre (illustrated above) pointing to his home in Great Hampden. [[Aylesbury Vale District Council]] use an image of the statue as their logo.

Outside of Britain, the towns of [[Hampden, Maryland]]; [[Hamden, Connecticut]]; [[Hampden, Maine]]; [[Hampden, Massachusetts]]; and [[Hampden, Newfoundland and Labrador]]; as well as the county of [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden]], [[Massachusetts]] are named in his honour. [[Hampden–Sydney College]] in [[Virginia]] is also named in honour of John Hampden and of [[Algernon Sydney]], another English patriot; and [[Mount Hampden]] in [[Zimbabwe]].

[[Thomas Gray]]'s poem \"[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]\" refers to the heroism of Hampden in the stanza:

'''John Hampden''', circa June 1595 –  24 June 1643, was an English landowner and politician, whose opposition to arbitrary taxes imposed by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] made him a national figure. An ally of [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] leader [[John Pym]], and cousin to [[Oliver Cromwell]], he was one of the [[Five Members]] whose attempted arrest in January 1642 sparked the [[First English Civil War]].

After war began in August 1642, Hampden raised an infantry regiment, and died of wounds received at the [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]] on 18 June 1643. His loss was considered a serious blow, largely because he was one of the few Parliamentary leaders able to hold the different factions together. 

His death in 1643 meant he avoided the bitter internal debates later in the war, the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, and establishment of [[The Protectorate]]. As a result, he is considered a less complex figure than either Cromwell, or even Pym; in 1841, his statue was erected in the [[Palace of Westminster]], to represent the Parliamentary cause.{{efn|The Royalist chosen was another moderate, [[Lucius_Cary,_2nd_Viscount_Falkland|Viscount Falkland]], killed at [[First_Battle_of_Newbury|Newbury]] three months later.}}    

A reputation for honest, principled, and patriotic opposition to arbitrary rule also made him a popular figure in [[North America]]. Prior to the 1774 [[American Revolution]], [[Benjamin_Franklin|Franklin]] and [[John_Adams|Adams]] were among those who referenced him to justify their cause.{{sfn|Jansson|2009|pp=11-12}}

==Biographical==
[[File:Gt Hampden Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great_and_Little_Hampden|Great Hampden church]], where Hampden and other family members were baptised, and later buried]]
John Hampden was born around June 1595, probably in [[London]], eldest son of William Hampden, (1570-1597), and Elizabeth Cromwell, (1574-1664); he had a younger brother, Richard, 1596 to 1659.{{sfn|Thompson|2010}}  

The Hampden family had been established in [[Buckinghamshire]] for many years; William was a lawyer, and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East_Looe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|East Looe]] in 1593.{{sfn|WJJ|1981}} He died in April 1597; his cousin, William Hampden of Ennington, was appointed executor, but became involved in a bitter legal dispute with Elizabeth.{{sfn|Russell|2008}}

In 1619, John married Elizabeth Symeon, and prior to her death in 1631, they had nine children. Seven survived into adulthood Ann (1616-1701), Elizabeth (1619-1643), John (1621-1642), William (died 1675), Ruth (1628-1687), Mary (1630-1689), and [[Richard_Hampden|Richard]] (1631-1695), [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under [[William III of England|William III]].<ref>{{cite web |title=John Hampden |url=https://www.geni.com/people/John-Hampden-Patriae-Pater/6000000003266399664 |website=Geni.com |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> In 1640, he married Letitia Knollys (1591-1666); they had no children.   

==Career==
In 1610, he graduated from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]; as legal training was then considered part of a gentleman's education, he attended the [[Inner Temple]] from 1613 to 1615. 

The Hampden family were [[Puritan]]s, a term then used for anyone who wanted to reform, or 'purify', the [[Church of England]]. It covered a variety of [[Christian_theology|doctrines]], of which [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] such as Hampden were the most prominent; it connected him to a network that included [[Richard_Knightley_(died_1639)|Sir Richard Knightley]], [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], and [[John_Preston_(priest)|John Preston]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} 

In 1621, Hampden was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]], a [[Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs|rotten borough]] in [[Cornwall]]. This is thought to have been through the influence of the local magnate, [[John_Arundell_(born_1576)|John Arundell]]; a good example of the complexity of the period, Arundell opposed [[Ship Money]] in 1636, but held [[Pendennis Castle]] for [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] until 1646.{{sfn|Duffin|Hunneyball|2010}}  
[[File:John Pym.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Pym]]; Hampden joined his attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]] in 1628]]
He financed the cost of restoring Parliamentary representation to [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]] in 1624, a seat he held until 1629. The [[2nd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1626 Parliament]] refused taxes without an agreement to [[Impeachment_in_the_United_Kingdom|impeach]] Charles' favourite, the [[George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], a military commander notorious for inefficiency, combined with extravagance; only his assassination in August 1628 prevented a second attempt.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} 

Rather than comply, Charles dissolved Parliament, and imposed a forced loan; over 70 individuals were jailed for not contributing, including Hampden's cousin, Sir Edmund Hampden.{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} Like many others, Hampden also refused to subscribe; and reducing the income from the loans. Charles was forced to call a [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]] in March 1627, which resulted in \"a preponderance of MPs opposed to the King\", including Selden, Coke, [[John Pym]] and a young [[Oliver Cromwell]].{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} released to attend the [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]], he supported [[John Pym]] and others in the Parliamentary attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} 

In the 17th century, religion and politics were considered interdependent; 'good government' required 'true religion', and alterations in one, implied alterations in the other.{{efn|This view was summarised by Hampden in the debate on the [[Petition of Right]]; \"Here is 1, an innovation of religion suspected; is it not high time to take it to heart and acquaint his Majesty? 2ly, alteration of government; can you forbear when it goes no less than the subversion of the whole state? 3ly, hemmed in with enemies; is it now a time to be silent, and not to show to his Majesty that a man that has so much power uses none of it to help us? If he be no papist, papists are friends and kindred to him.\"{{sfn|Keeler|Janssen Cole|1997|pp=121-122}}}} The two published [[sermons]], supporting the Caroline precepts of the [[divine right of kings]], and [[passive obedience]]; although censured for preaching against the established English constitution, Charles pardoned them, and made Sibthorpe a royal [[chaplain]].{{sfn|Little|2008|p=33}} 

and in 1629, he dissolved Parliament, initiating the period of [[Personal Rule]] that continued until 1640

In April 1640 he was elected MP for [[Buckinghamshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckinghamshire]] in the [[Short Parliament]] and was re-elected MP for Buckinghamshire for the [[Long Parliament]] in November 1640.<ref name=Willis>{{Cite Notitia Parliamentaria|converted=1|part=2|pages=229–239}}</ref> He sat until his death in 1643.

In the early days of his parliamentary career, he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], as in its later days he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Pym]] and to be commanded by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].



===Views on ship money===
Something of Hampden's fame no doubt is owing to the position which he took up as the opponent of [[ship money]].<ref>Gross, David (ed.) ''We Won't Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 9–16</ref> But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others as far as possible from the evil consequences of their actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.

===Committee work===
During these first parliaments Hampden did not, so far as we know, speak in public debate, but he was increasingly employed in [[committee]] work, for which he seems to have had a special aptitude. In 1626 he took an active part in the preparation of the charges against [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. In January 1627 he was bound over to answer at the council board for his refusal to pay the forced loan.  Later in the year he was committed to the gatehouse, and then sent into confinement in [[Hampshire]], from which he was liberated just before the meeting of the third parliament of the reign, in which he once more rendered useful but unobtrusive assistance to his leaders.

When the breach came in 1629 Hampden was found corresponding with the imprisoned Eliot, discussing with him the prospects of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Hampden was one of the persons to whom the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] granted land in [[Connecticut]] in what was then referred to as the [[Saybrook Colony]] and today as [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]]. While some claim there is no foundation but anecdote that Hampden attempted emigration to the colonies with Cromwell, others assert that Cromwell and other future architects of the English Civil War, including Hampden, may have been close to moving to America in the 1630s. The author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] points out that, \"Even in the 1770s, residents of [[Old Saybrook]] still talked about which prominent [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarian]] was to have had which town lot.\"<ref>Alfred A. Young, \"English Plebeian Culture an 18th Century American Radicalism\" in Margret Jacob and James Jacob, eds., \"The Origin of Anglo-American Radicalism\" 9New Jersey, Humanitarian Press International, 19910 Page 195,</ref>

It was not until 1637, however, that his resistance to the payment of ship money gained him wide fame. Seven out of the twelve judges sided against him, but the connection between the rights of property and the parliamentary system became firmly established in the popular mind. The tax had been justified, says Clarendon, who expresses his admiration at Hampden's \"rare temper and modesty\" at this crisis, \"upon such grounds and reasons as every standerby was able to swear was not law\" (''Hist''. i. 150,  vii. 82).

===Short Parliament===
In the Short Parliament that started on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House in the debate on 4 May in its opposition to the grant of twelve subsidies in return for the surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the [[Scotland|Scots]]. During the eventful months which followed, when [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford|Strafford]] was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his [[Bishops' Wars|Scottish war]], rumour has much to tell of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.

===Long Parliament===
In the [[Long Parliament]], though Hampden was by no means a frequent speaker, it is possible to trace his course with sufficient distinctness. His power consisted in his personal influence, and as a debater rather than as an orator.  \"He was not a man of many words,\" says Clarendon, \"and rarely began the discourse or made the first entrance upon any business that was assumed, but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a full debate and observed how the House was likely to be inclined, took up the argument and shortly and clearly and craftily so stated it that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired; and if he found he could not do that, he never was without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future\" (''Hist''. iii. 31). Unwearied in attendance upon committees, he was in all things ready to second Pym, whom he plainly regarded as his leader.

Hampden was one of the eight managers of Strafford's prosecution. Like Pym, he was in favour of the more legal and regular procedure by [[impeachment]] rather than by [[attainder]], which at the later stage was supported by the majority of the Commons; and through his influence a compromise was effected by which, while an attainder was subsequently adopted, Strafford's counsel were heard as in the case of an impeachment, and thus a serious breach between the two Houses, which threatened to cause the breakdown of the whole proceedings, was averted.

===Debate on episcopacy===
[[File:John Hampden Statue.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of John Hampden in Market Square, [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire]]

There was another point on which there was no agreement. A large minority wished to retain [[episcopacy]], and to keep the [[Book of Common Prayer]] unaltered, whilst the majority were at least willing to consider the question of abolishing the one and modifying the other. On this subject the parties which ultimately divided the House and the country itself were fully formed as early as 8 February 1641. It is enough to say that Hampden fully shared in the counsels of the opponents of episcopacy. It is not that he was a theoretical [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], but the [[bishop]]s had been in his days so fully engaged in the imposition of ceremonies regarded by the [[Puritans]] as verging on [[Papacy]] that it was difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate them from the cause in which they were embarked.  Closely connected with Hampden's distrust of the bishops was his distrust of monarchy as it then existed. The dispute about the church therefore soon attained the form of an attack upon [[monarchy]], and, when the majority of the [[House of Lords]] arrayed itself on the side of episcopacy and the Prayer Book, of an attack upon the House of Lords as well.

No serious importance therefore can be attached to the offers of advancement made from time to time to Hampden and his friends. Charles would gladly have given them office if they had been ready to desert their principles. Every day Hampden's conviction grew stronger that Charles would never surrender a position which he had taken up. In August 1641 Hampden was one of the four commissioners who attended Charles in Scotland, and the king's conduct there, connected with such events as the \"Incident\", must have proved to a man far less sagacious than Hampden that the time for compromise had gone by. He was therefore a warm supporter of the [[Grand Remonstrance]], and was marked out as one of the five impeached members, known thenceforth in history as the [[Five Members]] (the others being [[John Pym]], [[Arthur Haselrig]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]] and [[William Strode]]) whose attempted arrest brought at last the opposing parties into open collision. In the angry scene which arose on the proposal to print the Grand Remonstrance, it was Hampden's personal intervention which prevented an actual conflict, and it was after the impeachment had been attempted that Hampden laid down the two conditions under which resistance to the king became the duty of a good subject.  Those conditions were:
*an attack upon religion and
*an attack upon the fundamental laws.

There can be no doubt that Hampden fully believed that both those conditions were fulfilled at the opening of 1642.

==English Civil War==

When the [[English Civil War]] began, Hampden was appointed a member of the [[ Committee of Safety (England) #1642–1644 | Committee of Safety]], levied a [[regiment]] of Buckinghamshire men for the parliamentary cause, and in his capacity of deputy-lieutenant carried out the parliamentary [[Militia Ordinance]] in the county. In the earlier operations of the war he bore himself gallantly and well. He took no actual part in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] (23 October 1642). His troops in the rear,  however, arrested [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]'s charge at [[Kineton]], and he urged Essex to renew the attack here, and also after the disaster at [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]]. In the spring of 1643, Hampden's regiment took part in the [[siege of Reading]], which surrendered on 27 April. Although Essex intended to advance on the King's headquarters at Oxford, he remained at Reading because of widespread sickness in the army, a shortage of cavalry and to await a paymaster with funds to pay his troops. In early June 1643 he moved his army to Thame making his headquarters there on 10 June.

But it is not on his skill as a regimental officer that Hampden's fame rests. In war as in peace his distinction lay in his power of disentangling the essential part from the non-essential. In the previous constitutional struggle he had seen that the one thing necessary was to establish the supremacy of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  In the military struggle which followed he saw, as Cromwell saw afterwards, that the one thing necessary was to beat the enemy.  He protested at once against Essex's hesitations and compromises.  In the formation of the confederacy of the six associated counties, which was to supply a basis for Cromwell's operations, he took an active part.  His influence was felt alike in parliament and in the field but he was not in supreme command, and he had none of that impatience which often leads able men to fail in the execution of orders of which they disapprove.

===Death===
[[File:Hampden's monument, Chalgrove.jpg|thumb|Hampden's Monument, [[Chalgrove]]. A monument to John Hampden, who was mortally wounded 550 yards north of here in 1643 whilst fighting in the English Civil War on [[Battle of Chalgrove Field|Chalgrove Field]]]]

On the night of 17 June 1643, [[Prince Rupert]] sortied on a raid out of Oxford to capture the Parliamentarian army's paymaster, but while that failed, did succeed the next morning in overwhelming two of Essex's small garrison outposts at [[Postcombe]] and [[Chinnor]]. Hampden rode as a volunteer with 1,100 cavalry and dragoons commanded by Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] in pursuit of Rupert, with the intention of delaying him long enough for a larger force from Essex's main army to cut off his retreat. Rupert halted his own cavalry at [[Chalgrove]] to ambush the pursuit and allow 800 less mobile troops to escape via the ford of the [[River Thame]] at [[Chiselhampton]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]], Hampden was mortally wounded (some sources claim in the shoulder by two carbine balls, others by fragments from his own pistol exploding<ref>Britannica 1911 (article \"HAMPDEN, JOHN\") \"two carbine balls\". [http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/hampden.htm John Hampden, c.1595–1643] on the [http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/ British Civil Wars & Commonwealth website] \"possibly from his own pistol exploding\".</ref>) which shattered the bone and forced him to leave the field. He reached Thame, and his headquarters in the house of Ezekiel Browne (which became the Greyhound Inn).<ref name=\"A Short History of Thame School\"/>{{sfn|Nugent-Grenville|1854|p=361}} He survived six days, and died on 24 June.<ref>John Nichols \"The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 181\". p. 512. E. Cave, 1847</ref>

In the 1976 biography of Hampden written by Prof. John Adair,<ref name=\"adair\">Adair, John Eric, A life of John Hampden, the patriot (1594–1643), London: Macdonald and Jane's, 1976</ref> he concludes that it is most likely that Hampden died from an exploding pistol. [[Frederick Lee (priest)|Frederick George Lee]] in his book ''The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford'' (and available to view at the UK's National Archives or in the Royal Collection) lays out a version of this story.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/1070556/the-history-description-and-antiquities-of-the-prebendal-church-of-the-blessed|title=Lee, Frederick George – The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford ... / by Frederick George Lee.|website=www.royalcollection.org.uk}}</ref>

This account of his death was given by Sir Robert Pye his son-in-law...\"That in the action of Chalgrove Field, his pistol burst and shattered his hand in a terrible manner. He, however, rode off and got to his quarters but finding the wound mortal he sent for Sir Robert Pye then a colonel in the Parliamentary army – and who had married his eldest daughter – and told him that he looked on him in some degree accessory to his death as the pistols were present from him. Sir Robert assured him that he bought them in Paris from an eminent maker and proved them himself. It appeared on examining the other pistol that it was loaded to the muzzle with several supernumerary charges, owning to the carelessness of a servant. He was ordered to see that the pistols were loaded every morning which he did but without drawing the former charge.\" An exhumation of Hampden's body in 1828 showed that there was no damage to the shoulder but his 'right hand was shattered by the bursting of his pistol, and death probably ensued from [[tetanus|lockjaw]] arising out of extensive injury to the nervous system'.<ref>Frederick George Lee, The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford. Published 1883</ref>

It is also worth noting the following:
– in the book ''John Hampden'' by [[Frank Hansford-Miller]] published in 1976, it noted that his death was the result 'from the exploding of his own pistol in his own hand.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hansford-Miller |first1=Frank Herbert |title=John Hampden: an illustrated life of John Hampden, 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Shire Publications |isbn=978-0-85263-322-9 |language=en}}</ref> There has also been a scholarly analysis by the archivists at Hampden's school, Thame Grammar, who also conclude that he died accidentally from his own hand.<ref>[http://oldtamensians.info/current-news/page/4/ Old Tamensians]</ref>

Hampden's death so early in the war was a severe blow to the Parliamentarians.  During the preceding winter, Hampden had associated himself with John Pym's \"Middle Group\" in Parliament, which opposed any peace moves to the King except on favorable terms. At the same time he had worked to moderate the militancy of the parliamentary \"War Party\". Although Hampden was privately critical of Essex for not aggressively attacking after avoiding defeat at Edgehill and the standoff at [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], he remained publicly loyal and helped Essex resist the criticisms of the War Party. His death took with it a key link between the factions.

==Marriages & progeny==
Hampden married twice:
*Firstly in 1619, at St Mary's Church, Pyrton, [[Oxfordshire]]<ref>http://www.st-marys-pyrton.info/a-brief-history/</ref> to Elizabeth Symeon (d.1634<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/bucks/vol2/pp287-291|title=Parishes: Great Hampden – British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref>), a daughter of Edmund Symeon of [[Pyrton]], by whom he had 3 sons and 6 daughters, including:

His grandson [[John Hampden (1696–1754)|John Hampden]] (1696–1754), MP, of Hampden House, died without issue and left his property to his cousin [[Robert Hampden, 1st Viscount Hampden|Hon. Robert Trevor]] (later [[Robert Hampden, 1st Viscount Hampden]]), who assumed the surname Hampden, later  Hampden-Trevor.

Hampden is immortalised in St Stephen's Hall in the Palace of Westminster, where he and other notable Parliamentarians look on at visitors to the UK Parliament.<ref name=ssstat>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/architecture/palace-s-interiors/st-stephen-s-hall/|title=St Stephen's Hall|website=UK Parliament}}</ref>  In Britain diverse establishments are named after him, ranging from [[Hampden Park]], the home ground of [[Queen's Park F.C.]] and the [[Scotland national football team]], to an older persons' mental health unit at [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]]. Several schools use his name: a primary school in [[Wendover]] and another in Thame,  a [[grammar school]] in [[High Wycombe]] and a school in [[Hertfordshire]]. There is also a statue of him in [[Aylesbury]] town centre (illustrated above) pointing to his home in Great Hampden. [[Aylesbury Vale District Council]] use an image of the statue as their logo.

Outside of Britain, the towns of [[Hampden, Maryland]]; [[Hamden, Connecticut]]; [[Hampden, Maine]]; [[Hampden, Massachusetts]]; and [[Hampden, Newfoundland and Labrador]]; as well as the county of [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden]], [[Massachusetts]] are named in his honour. [[Hampden–Sydney College]] in [[Virginia]] is also named in honour of John Hampden and of [[Algernon Sydney]], another English patriot; and [[Mount Hampden]] in [[Zimbabwe]].

[[Thomas Gray]]'s poem \"[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]\" refers to the heroism of Hampden in the stanza:
\"Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast / The little tyrant of his fields withstood;/ Some mute inglorious [[John Milton|Milton]] here may rest, /  Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.\"<ref>\"The Works of Thomas Gray, Containing His Poems and Correspondence: With Memoirs of His Life and Writings, Volume 1\". p.120.

As one of the Five Members of the House of Commons, Hampden is commemorated at the [[State Opening of Parliament]] by the British monarch each year: the sovereign sits on the throne in the House of Lords and sends their messenger [[Black Rod]] to summons the Members of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to attend them. At his approach the doors to the Commons Chamber are slammed in his face, symbolising the refusal by the Commons to be entered by force by the monarch or one of the monarch's servants, and also its right to debate without the presence of the Queen's Representative.<ref name=\"State opening\"/> This is done in relation to the events of 1642, when King Charles I stormed into the House of Commons in an unsuccessful attempt to arrest the Five Members.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Black Rod|volume=4}}</ref><ref>John Joseph Bagley, A.

The [[London Underground]] also had an [[London Underground electric locomotives|electric locomotive]] built by [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] named after him. Used on the [[Metropolitan line]], No. 5 lasted along with other locomotives, until 1961.

'''John Hampden''', circa June 1595 –  24 June 1643, was an English landowner and politician, whose opposition to arbitrary taxes imposed by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] made him a national figure. An ally of [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] leader [[John Pym]], and cousin to [[Oliver Cromwell]], he was one of the [[Five Members]] whose attempted arrest in January 1642 sparked the [[First English Civil War]].

After war began in August 1642, Hampden raised an infantry regiment, and died of wounds received at the [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]] on 18 June 1643. His loss was considered a serious blow, largely because he was one of the few Parliamentary leaders able to hold the different factions together. 

His death in 1643 meant he avoided the bitter internal debates later in the war, the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, and establishment of [[The Protectorate]]. As a result, he is considered a less complex figure than either Cromwell, or even Pym; in 1841, his statue was erected in the [[Palace of Westminster]], to represent the Parliamentary cause.{{efn|The Royalist chosen was another moderate, [[Lucius_Cary,_2nd_Viscount_Falkland|Viscount Falkland]], killed at [[First_Battle_of_Newbury|Newbury]] three months later.}}    

A reputation for honest, principled, and patriotic opposition to arbitrary rule also made him a popular figure in [[North America]]. Prior to the 1774 [[American Revolution]], [[Benjamin_Franklin|Franklin]] and [[John_Adams|Adams]] were among those who referenced him to justify their cause.{{sfn|Jansson|2009|pp=11-12}}

==Biographical==
[[File:Gt Hampden Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great_and_Little_Hampden|Great Hampden church]], where Hampden and other family members were baptised, and later buried]]
John Hampden was born around June 1595, probably in [[London]], eldest son of William Hampden, (1570-1597), and Elizabeth Cromwell, (1574-1664); he had a younger brother, Richard, 1596 to 1659.{{sfn|Thompson|2010}}  

The Hampden family had been established in [[Buckinghamshire]] for many years; William was a lawyer, and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East_Looe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|East Looe]] in 1593.{{sfn|WJJ|1981}} He died in April 1597; his cousin, William Hampden of Ennington, was appointed executor, but became involved in a bitter legal dispute with Elizabeth.{{sfn|Russell|2008}}

In 1619, John married Elizabeth Symeon, and prior to her death in 1631, they had nine children. Seven survived into adulthood Ann (1616-1701), Elizabeth (1619-1643), John (1621-1642), William (died 1675), Ruth (1628-1687), Mary (1630-1689), and [[Richard_Hampden|Richard]] (1631-1695), [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under [[William III of England|William III]].<ref>{{cite web |title=John Hampden |url=https://www.geni.com/people/John-Hampden-Patriae-Pater/6000000003266399664 |website=Geni.com |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> In 1640, he married Letitia Knollys (1591-1666); they had no children.   

==Career==
In 1610, he graduated from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]; as legal training was then considered part of a gentleman's education, he attended the [[Inner Temple]] from 1613 to 1615. 

The Hampden family were [[Puritan]]s, a term then used for anyone who wanted to reform, or 'purify', the [[Church of England]]. It covered a variety of [[Christian_theology|doctrines]], of which [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] such as Hampden were the most prominent; it connected him to a network that included [[Richard_Knightley_(died_1639)|Sir Richard Knightley]], [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], and [[John_Preston_(priest)|John Preston]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} 

In 1621, Hampden was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]], a [[Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs|rotten borough]] in [[Cornwall]]. This is thought to have been through the influence of the local magnate, [[John_Arundell_(born_1576)|John Arundell]]; a good example of the complexity of the period, Arundell opposed [[Ship Money]] in 1636, but held [[Pendennis Castle]] for [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] until 1646.{{sfn|Duffin|Hunneyball|2010}}  
[[File:John Pym.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Pym]]; Hampden joined his attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]] in 1628]]
He financed the cost of restoring Parliamentary representation to [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]] in 1624, a seat he held until 1629. The [[2nd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1626 Parliament]] refused taxes without an agreement to [[Impeachment_in_the_United_Kingdom|impeach]] Charles' favourite, the [[George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], a military commander notorious for inefficiency, combined with extravagance; only his assassination in August 1628 prevented a second attempt.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} 

Rather than comply, Charles dissolved Parliament, and imposed a forced loan; over 70 individuals were jailed for not contributing, including Hampden's cousin, Sir Edmund Hampden.{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} Like many others, Hampden also refused to subscribe; and reducing the income from the loans. Charles was forced to call a [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]] in March 1627, which resulted in \"a preponderance of MPs opposed to the King\", including Selden, Coke, [[John Pym]] and a young [[Oliver Cromwell]].{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} released to attend the [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]], he supported [[John Pym]] and others in the Parliamentary attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} 

In the 17th century, religion and politics were considered interdependent; 'good government' required 'true religion', and alterations in one, implied alterations in the other.{{efn|This view was summarised by Hampden in the debate on the [[Petition of Right]]; \"Here is 1, an innovation of religion suspected; is it not high time to take it to heart and acquaint his Majesty? 2ly, alteration of government; can you forbear when it goes no less than the subversion of the whole state? 3ly, hemmed in with enemies; is it now a time to be silent, and not to show to his Majesty that a man that has so much power uses none of it to help us? If he be no papist, papists are friends and kindred to him.\"{{sfn|Keeler, Janssen Cole|1997|pp=121-122}}}} The two published [[sermons]], supporting the Caroline precepts of the [[divine right of kings]], and [[passive obedience]]; although censured for preaching against the established English constitution, Charles pardoned them, and made Sibthorpe a royal [[chaplain]].{{sfn|Little|2008|p=33}} 

and in 1629, he dissolved Parliament, initiating the period of [[Personal Rule]] that continued until 1640

In April 1640 he was elected MP for [[Buckinghamshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckinghamshire]] in the [[Short Parliament]] and was re-elected MP for Buckinghamshire for the [[Long Parliament]] in November 1640.<ref name=Willis>{{Cite Notitia Parliamentaria|converted=1|part=2|pages=229–239}}</ref> He sat until his death in 1643.

In the early days of his parliamentary career, he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], as in its later days he was content to be overshadowed by [[John Pym]] and to be commanded by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].



===Views on ship money===
Something of Hampden's fame no doubt is owing to the position which he took up as the opponent of [[ship money]].<ref>Gross, David (ed.) ''We Won't Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 9–16</ref> But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others as far as possible from the evil consequences of their actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.

===Committee work===
During these first parliaments Hampden did not, so far as we know, speak in public debate, but he was increasingly employed in [[committee]] work, for which he seems to have had a special aptitude. In 1626 he took an active part in the preparation of the charges against [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. In January 1627 he was bound over to answer at the council board for his refusal to pay the forced loan.  Later in the year he was committed to the gatehouse, and then sent into confinement in [[Hampshire]], from which he was liberated just before the meeting of the third parliament of the reign, in which he once more rendered useful but unobtrusive assistance to his leaders.

When the breach came in 1629 Hampden was found corresponding with the imprisoned Eliot, discussing with him the prospects of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Hampden was one of the persons to whom the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] granted land in [[Connecticut]] in what was then referred to as the [[Saybrook Colony]] and today as [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]]. While some claim there is no foundation but anecdote that Hampden attempted emigration to the colonies with Cromwell, others assert that Cromwell and other future architects of the English Civil War, including Hampden, may have been close to moving to America in the 1630s. The author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] points out that, \"Even in the 1770s, residents of [[Old Saybrook]] still talked about which prominent [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarian]] was to have had which town lot.\"<ref>Alfred A. Young, \"English Plebeian Culture an 18th Century American Radicalism\" in Margret Jacob and James Jacob, eds., \"The Origin of Anglo-American Radicalism\" 9New Jersey, Humanitarian Press International, 19910 Page 195,</ref>

It was not until 1637, however, that his resistance to the payment of ship money gained him wide fame. Seven out of the twelve judges sided against him, but the connection between the rights of property and the parliamentary system became firmly established in the popular mind. The tax had been justified, says Clarendon, who expresses his admiration at Hampden's \"rare temper and modesty\" at this crisis, \"upon such grounds and reasons as every standerby was able to swear was not law\" (''Hist''. i. 150,  vii. 82).

===Short Parliament===
In the Short Parliament that started on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House in the debate on 4 May in its opposition to the grant of twelve subsidies in return for the surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the [[Scotland|Scots]]. During the eventful months which followed, when [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford|Strafford]] was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his [[Bishops' Wars|Scottish war]], rumour has much to tell of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.

===Long Parliament===
In the [[Long Parliament]], though Hampden was by no means a frequent speaker, it is possible to trace his course with sufficient distinctness. His power consisted in his personal influence, and as a debater rather than as an orator.  \"He was not a man of many words,\" says Clarendon, \"and rarely began the discourse or made the first entrance upon any business that was assumed, but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a full debate and observed how the House was likely to be inclined, took up the argument and shortly and clearly and craftily so stated it that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired; and if he found he could not do that, he never was without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future\" (''Hist''. iii. 31). Unwearied in attendance upon committees, he was in all things ready to second Pym, whom he plainly regarded as his leader.

Hampden was one of the eight managers of Strafford's prosecution. Like Pym, he was in favour of the more legal and regular procedure by [[impeachment]] rather than by [[attainder]], which at the later stage was supported by the majority of the Commons; and through his influence a compromise was effected by which, while an attainder was subsequently adopted, Strafford's counsel were heard as in the case of an impeachment, and thus a serious breach between the two Houses, which threatened to cause the breakdown of the whole proceedings, was averted.

===Debate on episcopacy===
[[File:John Hampden Statue.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of John Hampden in Market Square, [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire]]

There was another point on which there was no agreement. A large minority wished to retain [[episcopacy]], and to keep the [[Book of Common Prayer]] unaltered, whilst the majority were at least willing to consider the question of abolishing the one and modifying the other. On this subject the parties which ultimately divided the House and the country itself were fully formed as early as 8 February 1641. It is enough to say that Hampden fully shared in the counsels of the opponents of episcopacy. It is not that he was a theoretical [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], but the [[bishop]]s had been in his days so fully engaged in the imposition of ceremonies regarded by the [[Puritans]] as verging on [[Papacy]] that it was difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate them from the cause in which they were embarked.  Closely connected with Hampden's distrust of the bishops was his distrust of monarchy as it then existed. The dispute about the church therefore soon attained the form of an attack upon [[monarchy]], and, when the majority of the [[House of Lords]] arrayed itself on the side of episcopacy and the Prayer Book, of an attack upon the House of Lords as well.

No serious importance therefore can be attached to the offers of advancement made from time to time to Hampden and his friends. Charles would gladly have given them office if they had been ready to desert their principles. Every day Hampden's conviction grew stronger that Charles would never surrender a position which he had taken up. In August 1641 Hampden was one of the four commissioners who attended Charles in Scotland, and the king's conduct there, connected with such events as the \"Incident\", must have proved to a man far less sagacious than Hampden that the time for compromise had gone by. He was therefore a warm supporter of the [[Grand Remonstrance]], and was marked out as one of the five impeached members, known thenceforth in history as the [[Five Members]] (the others being [[John Pym]], [[Arthur Haselrig]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]] and [[William Strode]]) whose attempted arrest brought at last the opposing parties into open collision. In the angry scene which arose on the proposal to print the Grand Remonstrance, it was Hampden's personal intervention which prevented an actual conflict, and it was after the impeachment had been attempted that Hampden laid down the two conditions under which resistance to the king became the duty of a good subject.  Those conditions were:
*an attack upon religion and
*an attack upon the fundamental laws.

There can be no doubt that Hampden fully believed that both those conditions were fulfilled at the opening of 1642.

==English Civil War==

When the [[English Civil War]] began, Hampden was appointed a member of the [[ Committee of Safety (England) #1642–1644 | Committee of Safety]], levied a [[regiment]] of Buckinghamshire men for the parliamentary cause, and in his capacity of deputy-lieutenant carried out the parliamentary [[Militia Ordinance]] in the county. In the earlier operations of the war he bore himself gallantly and well. He took no actual part in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] (23 October 1642). His troops in the rear,  however, arrested [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]'s charge at [[Kineton]], and he urged Essex to renew the attack here, and also after the disaster at [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]]. In the spring of 1643, Hampden's regiment took part in the [[siege of Reading]], which surrendered on 27 April. Although Essex intended to advance on the King's headquarters at Oxford, he remained at Reading because of widespread sickness in the army, a shortage of cavalry and to await a paymaster with funds to pay his troops. In early June 1643 he moved his army to Thame making his headquarters there on 10 June.

But it is not on his skill as a regimental officer that Hampden's fame rests. In war as in peace his distinction lay in his power of disentangling the essential part from the non-essential. In the previous constitutional struggle he had seen that the one thing necessary was to establish the supremacy of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  In the military struggle which followed he saw, as Cromwell saw afterwards, that the one thing necessary was to beat the enemy.  He protested at once against Essex's hesitations and compromises.  In the formation of the confederacy of the six associated counties, which was to supply a basis for Cromwell's operations, he took an active part.  His influence was felt alike in parliament and in the field but he was not in supreme command, and he had none of that impatience which often leads able men to fail in the execution of orders of which they disapprove.

===Death===
[[File:Hampden's monument, Chalgrove.jpg|thumb|Hampden's Monument, [[Chalgrove]]. A monument to John Hampden, who was mortally wounded 550 yards north of here in 1643 whilst fighting in the English Civil War on [[Battle of Chalgrove Field|Chalgrove Field]]]]

On the night of 17 June 1643, [[Prince Rupert]] sortied on a raid out of Oxford to capture the Parliamentarian army's paymaster, but while that failed, did succeed the next morning in overwhelming two of Essex's small garrison outposts at [[Postcombe]] and [[Chinnor]]. Hampden rode as a volunteer with 1,100 cavalry and dragoons commanded by Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] in pursuit of Rupert, with the intention of delaying him long enough for a larger force from Essex's main army to cut off his retreat. Rupert halted his own cavalry at [[Chalgrove]] to ambush the pursuit and allow 800 less mobile troops to escape via the ford of the [[River Thame]] at [[Chiselhampton]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]], Hampden was mortally wounded (some sources claim in the shoulder by two carbine balls, others by fragments from his own pistol exploding<ref>Britannica 1911 (article \"HAMPDEN, JOHN\") \"two carbine balls\". [http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/hampden.htm John Hampden, c.1595–1643] on the [http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/ British Civil Wars & Commonwealth website] \"possibly from his own pistol exploding\".</ref>) which shattered the bone and forced him to leave the field. He reached Thame, and his headquarters in the house of Ezekiel Browne (which became the Greyhound Inn).<ref name=\"A Short History of Thame School\"/>{{sfn|Nugent-Grenville|1854|p=361}} He survived six days, and died on 24 June.<ref>John Nichols \"The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 181\". p. 512. E. Cave, 1847</ref>

In the 1976 biography of Hampden written by Prof. John Adair,<ref name=\"adair\">Adair, John Eric, A life of John Hampden, the patriot (1594–1643), London: Macdonald and Jane's, 1976</ref> he concludes that it is most likely that Hampden died from an exploding pistol. [[Frederick Lee (priest)|Frederick George Lee]] in his book ''The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford'' (and available to view at the UK's National Archives or in the Royal Collection) lays out a version of this story.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/1070556/the-history-description-and-antiquities-of-the-prebendal-church-of-the-blessed|title=Lee, Frederick George – The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford ... / by Frederick George Lee.|website=www.royalcollection.org.uk}}</ref>

This account of his death was given by Sir Robert Pye his son-in-law...\"That in the action of Chalgrove Field, his pistol burst and shattered his hand in a terrible manner. He, however, rode off and got to his quarters but finding the wound mortal he sent for Sir Robert Pye then a colonel in the Parliamentary army – and who had married his eldest daughter – and told him that he looked on him in some degree accessory to his death as the pistols were present from him. Sir Robert assured him that he bought them in Paris from an eminent maker and proved them himself. It appeared on examining the other pistol that it was loaded to the muzzle with several supernumerary charges, owning to the carelessness of a servant. He was ordered to see that the pistols were loaded every morning which he did but without drawing the former charge.\" An exhumation of Hampden's body in 1828 showed that there was no damage to the shoulder but his 'right hand was shattered by the bursting of his pistol, and death probably ensued from [[tetanus|lockjaw]] arising out of extensive injury to the nervous system'.<ref>Frederick George Lee, The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford. Published 1883</ref>

It is also worth noting the following:
– in the book ''John Hampden'' by [[Frank Hansford-Miller]] published in 1976, it noted that his death was the result 'from the exploding of his own pistol in his own hand.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hansford-Miller |first1=Frank Herbert |title=John Hampden: an illustrated life of John Hampden, 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Shire Publications |isbn=978-0-85263-322-9 |language=en}}</ref> There has also been a scholarly analysis by the archivists at Hampden's school, Thame Grammar, who also conclude that he died accidentally from his own hand.<ref>[http://oldtamensians.info/current-news/page/4/ Old Tamensians]</ref>

Hampden's death so early in the war was a severe blow to the Parliamentarians.  During the preceding winter, Hampden had associated himself with John Pym's \"Middle Group\" in Parliament, which opposed any peace moves to the King except on favorable terms. At the same time he had worked to moderate the militancy of the parliamentary \"War Party\". Although Hampden was privately critical of Essex for not aggressively attacking after avoiding defeat at Edgehill and the standoff at [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], he remained publicly loyal and helped Essex resist the criticisms of the War Party. His death took with it a key link between the factions. Hearing of his death, the Member of Parliament [[Anthony Nicholl]] pronounced: \"Never Kingdom received a greater loss in one subject, never a man a truer and faithful friend.\"<ref>\"Selected Readings in English History\". p. 265. Ginn, 1913</ref>

Hampden is immortalised in St Stephen's Hall in the Palace of Westminster, where he and other notable Parliamentarians look on at visitors to the UK Parliament.<ref name=ssstat>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/architecture/palace-s-interiors/st-stephen-s-hall/|title=St Stephen's Hall|website=UK Parliament}}</ref>  In Britain diverse establishments are named after him, ranging from [[Hampden Park]], the home ground of [[Queen's Park F.C.]] and the [[Scotland national football team]], to an older persons' mental health unit at [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]]. Several schools use his name: a primary school in [[Wendover]] and another in Thame,  a [[grammar school]] in [[High Wycombe]] and a school in [[Hertfordshire]]. There is also a statue of him in [[Aylesbury]] town centre (illustrated above) pointing to his home in Great Hampden. [[Aylesbury Vale District Council]] use an image of the statue as their logo.

Outside of Britain, the towns of [[Hampden, Maryland]]; [[Hamden, Connecticut]]; [[Hampden, Maine]]; [[Hampden, Massachusetts]]; and [[Hampden, Newfoundland and Labrador]]; as well as the county of [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden]], [[Massachusetts]] are named in his honour. [[Hampden–Sydney College]] in [[Virginia]] is also named in honour of John Hampden and of [[Algernon Sydney]], another English patriot; and [[Mount Hampden]] in [[Zimbabwe]].

[[Thomas Gray]]'s poem \"[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]\" refers to the heroism of Hampden in the stanza:
\"Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast / The little tyrant of his fields withstood;/ Some mute inglorious [[John Milton|Milton]] here may rest, /  Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.\"<ref>\"The Works of Thomas Gray, Containing His Poems and Correspondence: With Memoirs of His Life and Writings, Volume 1\". p.120.

As one of the Five Members of the House of Commons, Hampden is commemorated at the [[State Opening of Parliament]] by the British monarch each year: the sovereign sits on the throne in the House of Lords and sends their messenger [[Black Rod]] to summons the Members of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to attend them. At his approach the doors to the Commons Chamber are slammed in his face, symbolising the refusal by the Commons to be entered by force by the monarch or one of the monarch's servants, and also its right to debate without the presence of the Queen's Representative.<ref name=\"State opening\"/> This is done in relation to the events of 1642, when King Charles I stormed into the House of Commons in an unsuccessful attempt to arrest the Five Members.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Black Rod|volume=4}}</ref><ref>John Joseph Bagley, A.

The [[Handley Page Hampden]] bomber was named in honour of John Hampden.

The [[London Underground]] also had an [[London Underground electric locomotives|electric locomotive]] built by [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] named after him. Used on the [[Metropolitan line]], No. 5 lasted along with other locomotives, until 1961. Painted a maroon colour, she is now one of only two of the original twenty locomotives to survive, and is kept on display in the [[London Transport Museum]].

'''Liu Tingting''' ([[Simplified Chinese characters|Chinese]]: 刘婷婷; [[pinyin]]: ''Liú Tíngtíng''; born September 6, 2000, [[Guangdong]]) is a [[China|Chinese]] [[Artistic gymnastics|artistic gymnast]] and the current team captain of the Chinese women's national artistic gymnastics team. She is best known for her innovative, quick connections and high degree of difficulty on balance beam and uneven bars. She is the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2018 World]] and [[2017 Asian Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2017 Asian]] champion on balance beam, and the [[Gymnastics at the 2018 Asian Games – Women's uneven bars|2018 Asian Games]] and [[2019 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2019 Chinese]] champion on the uneven bars. She has also competed in the all-around event for most her senior career. She is the [[2017 Asian Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2017 Asian]] and [[2019 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2019 Chinese]] champion in the all-around.

== Career ==

=== Junior ===
====2013====

Liu debuted at the national level when she competed at the senior-level [[2013 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2013 Chinese National Championships]]. Representing the province of Guangdong, she qualified in fifth place to the all-around final and seventh place to the balance beam final. She was initially the first reverse for the floor exercise final, but ultimately entered the final after Jiang Tong withdrew. In the team final, Liu contributed counting scores on all four events and ultimately won the silver medal. She then placed sixth in the all-around final, where she was the top-scoring junior. She concluded the competition by placing eighth in the balance beam final and fifth in the floor exercise final.

She also competed at the senior-level [[2013 National Games of China|2013 National Games]], a multi-sport event with nearly 10,000 participating athletes, where she placed fourth with her provincial team.

====2014: Junior National Champion====

Liu made her international debut the following year at the [[2014 Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championships|2014 Pacific Rim Championships]] in April, where she won a bronze medal with the team and qualified to all five junior individual finals. She recorded the fifth-highest total score in the junior individual all-around behind [[Bailie Key]], [[Nia Dennis]], and [[Norah Flatley]] of the United States and countrywoman [[Luo Huan]], although after Flatley's exclusion due to the two-per-country rule she placed fourth. She then placed third in the junior uneven bars final behind Luo and Key and seventh in the junior vault, balance beam, and floor exercise finals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2014/04/12/2014-pacific-rim-championships-results/|title=2014 Pacific Rim Championships Results|date=2014-04-12|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> These championships were the first of many events throughout Liu and Luo's careers where they competed together, often placing closely in the all-around and event finals.

Liu then competed at the senior-level [[2014 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2014 Chinese National Championships]] in May. She led her provincial team to the silver medal, once again contributing counting scores on every event. Her vault and uneven bars scores were both top-five among all gymnasts in the team final. She then placed ninth in the individual all-around final, sixth in the uneven bars final, and fifth in the floor exercise final. She won her first individual national medal by placing third in the balance beam final behind [[Shang Chunsong]] and [[Bai Yawen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2014/05/12/2014-chinese-championships-results/|title=2014 Chinese Championships Results|date=2014-05-12|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Liu dominated at her final competition of the year in June, the National Junior Championships. She won the all-around, uneven bars, and floor exercise titles, placed second on vault behind [[Liu Jinru]], and second on balance beam behind Zhang Wenxin.

====2015====

Liu's first major competition of the year was the [[2015 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2015 Chinese National Championships]] at the end of May, marking her third time competing at the senior-level championships. Liu qualified in second place to the all-around final, behind only [[Wang Yan (gymnast)|Wang Yan]], third place to the uneven bars final behind [[Fan Yilin]] and [[Tan Jiaxin]], and fourth place to the floor exercise final. In the team competition, Liu once again led the Guangdong provincial team to the podium, winning a team bronze medal. In the all-around final, a fall on the balance beam caused her to place sixth, although she was still the top-placing junior athlete ahead of [[Luo Huan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2015/06/04/shang-chunsong-finally-gets-national-gold/|title=Shang Chunsong Finally Gets National Gold|date=2015-06-04|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> In event finals, Liu placed eighth on uneven bars and fifth on floor exercise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2015/06/01/2015-chinese-championships-results/|title=2015 Chinese Championships Results|date=2015-06-01|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Liu then competed two weeks later at the national junior championships, entering as the defending champion. She qualified to the all-around final in first place and to all four event finals. She then placed second in the team final with her provincial team, which included for the first time [[Chen Yile]]. In the all-around final, Liu defended her title to win the gold medal, placing three points ahead of runner-up [[Luo Huan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golden-china.tumblr.com/post/122014525064/aa-results-and-videos-2015-chinese-junior-national|title=AA results and videos 2015 Chinese Junior National Championships|website=Golden China|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> In event finals, Liu performed very well. She placed first on balance beam, second on uneven bars behind Luo, third on vault behind [[Liu Jinru]] and [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]], and fourth on floor exercise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golden-china.tumblr.com/post/122105654374/ef-results-and-videos-2015-chinese-junior-national|title=EF results and videos 2015 Chinese Junior National Championships|website=Golden China|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> Interestingly, Liu Tingting, Luo Huan, Chen Yile, Zhang Jin, and Liu Jinru were the five members of the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|world championships team three years later]].

Based on her results at the senior- and junior-level national championships, Liu was selected to compete at the Junior Japan International in September, a major international meet for junior-level competitors. Although she was considered a podium threat for the all-around, mistakes on floor exercise in the all-around final ultimately resulted in a fifth-place finish. She then placed fifth in the uneven bars final, but then concluded her competition by rebounding to win the gold medal on the balance beam, ahead of American junior national champions [[Laurie Hernandez]] and [[Jazmyn Foberg]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2015/09/22/2015-junior-japan-international-results/|title=2015 Junior Japan International Results|date=2015-09-22|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> This marked Liu's first international gold medal.

Liu's final junior competition was the National Youth Games, a quadrennial multi-sport event for Chinese athletes under the age of 21, in October.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaaf.org/news/report/national-games-conclude-with-double-for-dong|title=National Games conclude with double for Dong Yanmei{{!}} News {{!}} iaaf.org|website=www.iaaf.org|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> Although Guangdong did not field a full team, Liu individually won gold medals in the all-around, uneven bars, and balance beam finals. She had the top score on every single event in the all-around final, and the highest difficulty score in both event finals. She also placed third on floor exercise. These results cemented Liu as a contender for the Chinese team in the coming Olympic year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2015/10/28/liu-dominates-chinese-youth-games/|title=Liu Dominates Chinese Youth Games|date=2015-10-28|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

=== Senior ===
====2016: Debut====

After competing at the junior level for three years nationally and two years internationally, Liu made her senior debut at just 15 years of age at the [[2016 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2016 Chinese National Championships]] in May. In the first round, Liu performed very well, qualifying to the all-around final in second place behind reigning national champion [[Shang Chunsong]] and to three event finals: bars in second place, beam in third place, and floor in sixth place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2016/05/16/2016-chinese-championships-results/|title=2016 Chinese Championships Results|last=Says|first=Salon De Massage Lyon|date=2016-05-16|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> In the all-around final, Liu fell on her double-twisting [[Yurchenko (vault)|Yurchenko]] vault and made mistakes on beam, ultimately finishing in third place by more than a point behind Shang and just two tenths behind [[Mao Yi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2016/05/13/shang-defends-national-championship-title/|title=Shang Defends National Championship Title|date=2016-05-14|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> In event finals, Liu won the silver medal on balance beam, once again behind Shang. She finished fifth on uneven bars after a mistake on her pirouette, and fifth on floor exercise with a clean routine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2016/05/15/chinese-nationals-conclude-with-event-finals/|title=Chinese Nationals Conclude with Event Finals|date=2016-05-16|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

The following week, Liu was named to the nominative roster for the 5-member Chinese [[Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Rio de Janeiro Olympic]] women's artistic gymnastics team along with [[2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2015 World Championships]] team members [[Shang Chunsong]], [[Mao Yi]], [[Fan Yilin]], and [[Wang Yan (gymnast)|Wang Yan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2016/05/16/shang-leads-chinas-olympic-nominative-team/|title=Shang Leads China’s Olympic Nominative Team|date=2016-05-16|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> However, on July 18, it was announced that she had suffered a hand injury while training on uneven bars and would be replaced by 19-year-old [[Tan Jiaxin]], a two-time World team silver medalist in [[2014 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2014]] and [[2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2015]]. Liu did not compete for the remainder of the season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.intlgymnast.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4619:tan-jiaxin-to-replace-liu-tingting-in-rio&catid=2:news&Itemid=53|title=Tan Jiaxin to Replace Liu Tingting in Rio|last=Turner|first=Amanda|website=International Gymnast Magazine Online|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

====2017: Asian All-Around Champion====

Liu's delayed senior international debut finally came at the [[2017 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series|2017 Melbourne World Cup]] in February, where she competed alongside Olympian [[Wang Yan (gymnast)|Wang Yan]] and [[Luo Huan]]. Liu qualified first on balance beam, second on floor exercise, and third on uneven bars. She went on to place first on uneven bars ahead of Huan and Rianna Mizzen of Australia, first on balance beam ahead of [[Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Women's balance beam|reigning Olympic Champion]] [[Sanne Wevers]] of the Netherlands and [[Emily Little]], and third on floor exercise behind Australians Little and [[Georgia Godwin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/02/22/2017-melbourne-world-cup-results/|title=2017 Melbourne World Cup Results|date=2017-02-22|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

In March, Liu competed again on the World Cup circuit alongside [[Wang Yan (gymnast)|Wang Yan]] and [[Luo Huan]], this time at the event in [[2017 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series|Doha]]. In qualifications, Liu once again advanced to three event finals by placing second on uneven bars, first on balance beam, and first on floor exercise. In event finals, she fell on uneven bars to place fourth behind Luo, [[Zsófia Kovács (gymnast)|Zsófia Kovács]] of Hungary, and [[Georgia-Rose Brown]] of Australia. She rebounded to win the gold medal on both balance beam, ahead of [[Gymnastics at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Women's balance beam|2004 Olympic Champion]] [[Cătălina Ponor|Catalina Ponor]] and Luo, and floor, ahead of [[Emily Little]] and Croatian [[Ana Đerek]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017-doha-world-cup/|title=2017 Doha World Cup|date=2017-02-25|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

In May, Liu competed the all-around for the first time in over a year at her fifth consecutive [[2017 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|Chinese National Championships]]. She qualified in third place to the all around final, competing a full-twisting Yurchenko vault as opposed to the double-twisting Yurchenko she competed in 2016, and qualified to the floor exercise final in first place. In the team final, Liu's Guangdong provincial team won gold by a large margin ahead of Beijing, marking Liu's first gold medal at the senior national championships. She was one of the favorites to win the all-around title along with top qualifiers [[Luo Huan]] and provincial teammate [[Chen Yile]], but pulled out of the all-around final after a minor injury.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/05/03/chinese-nationals-begin-this-weekend/|title=Chinese Nationals Begin This Weekend|date=2017-05-03|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> She returned for the floor exercise final and won the silver medal behind Olympian [[Shang Chunsong]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/05/06/2017-chinese-championships-results/|title=2017 Chinese Championships Results|date=2017-05-06|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Two weeks later, Liu competed at the [[2017 Asian Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2017 Asian Championships]] in [[Bangkok, Thailand]] as a member of the Chinese team alongside [[Luo Huan]], [[Liu Jinru]], and [[Tan Jiaxin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.agu-gymnastics.com/index.php/component/icagenda/33-7th-senior-art-asian-championships-in-bangkok-tha?Itemid=730|title=7th Senior ART Asian Championships in THA 2017|website=Asian Gymnastics Union|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> They won the team gold medal by nearly ten points ahead of North Korea and nearly 20 points ahead of Japan. In the all-around final, Liu recorded the top score on uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise to win the gold medal over reigning national all-around champion Luo and qualify in first place to those three event finals. This win marked Liu's first senior and first international all-around title. Her score on the balance beam in the all-around of 15.300 was the top international score on the apparatus of the entire 2017 season. In event finals, she placed second on uneven bars behind Luo, first on balance beam ahead of Luo, and fourth on floor exercise in a tie with Luo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/05/19/2017-asian-championships-results/|title=2017 Asian Championships Results|date=2017-05-19|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> These results made Liu, Luo, and [[Kim Su-jong|Kim Su-Jong]] of North Korea the most decorated female athletes of the championships, with four medals each.

In September, Liu was named to the nominative roster for the Chinese team for the [[2017 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2017 World Championships]] to compete the all-around alongside [[Luo Huan]], with specialists [[Wang Yan (gymnast)|Wang Yan]] and [[Fan Yilin]] rounding out the team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/09/04/i-cant-stop-myself-from-crying-chinas-worlds-team-and-retirements/|title=“I Can’t Stop Myself From Crying”: China’s Worlds Team and Retirements|date=2017-09-04|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> Shortly after, Liu competed as a member of the Guangdong provincial team at the [[2017 National Games of China|2017 National Games]]. She upgraded to a double-twisting Yurchenko vault for the first time since the [[2016 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2016 National Championships]] and contributed performances on all four events in the team final to the gold medal. In the all-around final, Liu recorded the top score on beam and won the silver medal behind junior provincial teammate [[Chen Yile]] and ahead of Wang and Luo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/09/08/china-looking-strong-for-worlds-and-beyond/|title=China Looking Strong For Worlds and Beyond|date=2017-09-08|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> In event finals, she placed eighth on bars, fourth on beam behind juniors Li Qi, Chen, and [[Tang Xijing]], and third on floor behind Wang and Chen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/09/01/2017-chinese-national-games-results/|title=2017 Chinese National Games Results|date=2017-09-01|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Although Liu was considered to be a contender for an all-around medal and a frontrunner for the balance beam title at the start of the [[2017 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Canada]], an ankle injury suffered during training limited Liu to just competing on the balance beam in the qualification round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/09/08/china-looking-strong-for-worlds-and-beyond/|title=China Looking Strong For Worlds and Beyond|date=2017-09-08|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golden-china.tumblr.com/post/165969389994/chinas-world-roster-again|title=Golden China|website=Golden China|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> While she qualified into the balance beam final in seventh place, she ultimately placed seventh in the final with a tentative routine due to her injury. While Liu's routine difficulty relied primarily on connecting many skills for bonuses, the injury forced her to pause between many of her skills. As such, her awarded difficulty score (5.5) was a full point less than the score she received when healthy (6.5) at the Asian Championships in May.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/10/25/the-montreal-balance-beam-final/|title=The Montreal Balance Beam Final|date=2017-10-26|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

====2018: World Balance Beam Champion====

Following recovery from her ankle injury, Liu competed in May at the [[2018 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2018 Chinese National Championships]] representing Guangdong province, although she did not compete floor exercise to avoid re-injuring her ankle. In qualification, Liu tied with new senior gymnast and teammate [[Chen Yile]] for fourth place on uneven bars and placed second on balance beam behind Chen to advance to both event finals. In the team finals, Guangdong repeated as champion, with Liu contributing scores on vault, uneven bars (recording the highest score of all competitors in the team final), and balance beam. In event finals, she placed sixth on both uneven bars and balance beam after mistakes in both finals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2018/05/09/2018-chinese-championships-results/|title=2018 Chinese Championships Results|date=2018-05-09|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

In August, Liu was named to the Chinese team for the [[Gymnastics at the 2018 Asian Games|2018 Asian Games]], a quadrennial multi-sport international competition with nearly 12,000 competitors, in [[Jakarta, Indonesia]]. Her teammates included [[Chen Yile]], [[Liu Jinru]], [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]], and Li Qi (who later withdrew and was replaced by reigning national champion [[Luo Huan]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golden-china.tumblr.com/post/176792896919/chinese-wag-asian-games-team|title=Golden China|website=Golden China|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golden-china.tumblr.com/post/177095531419/golden-china-the-rumour-is-li-qi-got-injured-on|title=Golden China|website=Golden China|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> In qualifications, Liu competed only on uneven bars, where she qualified in first place to the event final, and balance beam, where she scored the fourth-best score of all competitors, but did not qualify to the final as her teammates Chen, Zhang, and Luo all placed higher. In [[Gymnastics at the 2018 Asian Games – Women's artistic team|team finals]], Liu competed on vault instead of Chen, uneven bars, and balance beam, once again recording the highest score on uneven bars among all competitors. In the [[Gymnastics at the 2018 Asian Games – Women's uneven bars|event final]], she delivered yet another strong routine to win the Asian Games uneven bars title by nearly half a point ahead of runner-up Luo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2018/08/28/2018-asian-games-results/|title=2018 Asian Games Results|date=2018-08-28|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Following the Asian Games, the entire team including Liu were named to the roster for the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2018 World Championships]] in [[Doha|Doha, Qatar]]. In the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships#Qualification#Women's%20Results|qualification]] round, Liu placed eight on balance beam, second on the Chinese team (behind [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]]) to qualify for the event final after putting her hand down on her front tuck. She also placed ninth on uneven bars, second on the Chinese team (behind [[Luo Huan]]) and was named first alternate for that final. Overall, China qualified in third place to the team final, less than half a point behind Russia in second and more than nine points behind the United States in first place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2018/10/30/u-s-women-poised-for-fourth-straight-worlds-team-gold/|title=U.S. Women Poised for Fourth Straight Worlds Team Gold|date=2018-10-30|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

In the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships#Women's%20Results#Team|team final]], Liu had an error on uneven bars but performed well on the balance beam despite falls from teammates Chen and Zhang, tying with Japanese [[Mai Murakami]] for the third-highest score among all competitors in the team final after American [[Kara Eaker]] and French [[Marine Boyer]]. China won the team bronze medal behind the United States and Russia, earning Liu her first [[World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] medal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2018/11/06/2018-world-championships-results/|title=2018 World Championships Results|date=2018-11-06|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

In the balance beam event final, Liu competed last. The only competitor to have fully hit her routine, [[Ana Padurariu]] of Canada, sat at the top of the leaderboard, followed by [[Simone Biles]] of the United States who had made several smaller errors. Liu performed an exceptional routine featuring strong ring leaps and her signature front handspring-front tuck acrobatic series to take the gold medal in stunning fashion. Among the finalists, Liu earned both the highest difficulty (6.3) and the highest execution (8.233) scores, and she alone was awarded with her entire attempted connection value score.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2018/11/03/2018-world-championships-live-blog-event-finals-day-2/|title=2018 World Championships Live Blog {{!}} Event Finals Day 2|date=2018-11-03|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> Liu became the sixth Chinese woman to win the World balance beam title and the first since [[Sui Lu]] in 2011. She left the World Championships as the third most decorated female gymnast after Biles and [[Morgan Hurd]] of the United States.

==== 2019: National Champion ====

Liu competed at the [[2019 City of Jesolo Trophy]] in April alongside fellow World team member [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]] and first-year seniors [[Qi Qi (gymnast)|Qi Qi]] and [[Tang Xijing]] in [[Jesolo|Jesolo, Italy]]. There she won silver with the Chinese team, silver in the all-around behind [[Sunisa Lee]] of the United States, and gold in the balance beam final ahead of Americans [[Emma Malabuyo]] and Lee. She also placed fourth on the uneven bars behind Lee, Xijing, and [[Elisa Iorio]] of the home team Italy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2019/03/04/2019-city-of-jesolo-trophy-results/|title=2019 City of Jesolo Trophy Results|last=says|first=Nina|date=2019-03-04|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> Liu competed the all-around again after having not performed a floor exercise since the [[2017 National Games of China|2017 National Games]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2019/03/07/the-ten-biggest-jesolo-moments/|title=The Ten Biggest Jesolo Moments|date=2019-03-07|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Liu next competed at her seventh consecutive [[2019 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|Chinese National Championships]] in May, once again representing her provincial team of Guangdong. In the qualification round, Liu individually qualified to the all-around final in first place, the uneven bars final in second place behind two-time world champion [[Fan Yilin]], the balance beam final in third place behind junior [[Ou Yushan]] and [[Luo Huan]], and the floor exercise final tied for second place behind [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]]. In the team final, Liu contributed scores on all four events to lead Guangdong to its third straight team gold medal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2019/05/16/2019-chinese-championships-results/|title=2019 Chinese Championships Results|date=2019-05-16|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

In the all-around final, Liu hit all four of her routines cleanly and won her first senior Chinese national all-around title. Her score from the day of all-around competition was half a point higher than runner-up Luo and nearly a full point above bronze medalist Ou. During the all-around, she delivered the highest score on uneven bars, the third highest score on balance beam behind juniors Ou and [[Guan Chenchen]], and the fifth highest on floor exercise. In the event finals, Liu continued performing very well. She won the Chinese uneven bars title ahead of Cheng Shiyi and [[Ou Yushan]] after a major error from pre-final favorite [[Fan Yilin]], placed fourth on balance beam behind Ou, [[Tang Xijing]], and [[Qi Qi (gymnast)|Qi Qi]], and third on floor exercise behind [[Shang Chunsong]] and Ou.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2019/05/16/2019-chinese-championships-results/|title=2019 Chinese Championships Results|date=2019-05-16|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Liu did not compete again until October, when she was named as the captain of the Chinese team for the [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2019 World Championships]] in [[Stuttgart|Stuttgart, Germany]] alongside [[Chen Yile]], [[Li Shijia]], [[Qi Qi (gymnast)|Qi Qi]], [[Tang Xijing]], and alternate [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sports.xinhuanet.com/c/2019-09/17/c_1125004487.htm|title=体操世锦赛中国队参赛名单揭晓-新华网体育|website=sports.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> This announcement made Liu the only Chinese gymnast to be a member of all three world championships teams during the 2017-2020 quadrennium.

In the [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships#Qualification#Women's results|qualification round]], Liu competed the all-around along with Li and Tang, contributing counting scores on uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise. As a team, China qualified in second place, behind the United States by roughly five points and ahead of third-place Russia by roughly one point. Individually, Liu recorded the sixth-highest all-around score, just ahead of her teammate Li, but qualified into the all-around in fifth place after [[Grace McCallum]]'s exclusion due to the two-per-country limit. Additionally, Liu qualified in sixth place to the uneven bars final (teammate Tang was the first alternate), and in third place to the balance beam final behind [[Simone Biles]] and Li.

In the team final, Liu performed below her usual standards. Competing last on uneven bars, she fell twice during her routine and scored nearly three points lower than her score in qualifications. On balance beam, another fall cost her roughly two points compared to her qualification routine. She rebounded on floor exercise, but her final routine was not enough to prevent China from finishing fourth behind the United States, Russia, and Italy.<ref name=TG100819>{{cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2019/10/08/2019-world-championships-womens-team-final-live-blog/|title=2019 World Championships {{!}} Women’s Team Final Live Blog|date=October 8, 2019|first=Lauren|last=Hopkins|publisher=The Gymternet}}</ref> Liu withdrew from the all-around final and was replaced by Tang, who had been affected by the two-per-country rule.<ref name=OC100919>{{cite web|url=https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/stories/live/detail/artistic-gymnastics-world-championships-2019-live-9-october/|title=Artistic Gymnastics World Championships 2019 {{!}} Day 6 As It Happened|first1=ZK|last1=Goh|first2=Scott|last2=Bregman|publisher=[[Olympic Channel]]|date=October 9, 2019|quote=It appears that China's women's team captain, Liu Tingting, is out of the all-around final tomorrow.

'''Liu Tingting''' ([[Simplified Chinese characters|Chinese]]: 刘婷婷; [[pinyin]]: ''Liú Tíngtíng''; born September 6, 2000, [[Guangdong]]) is a [[China|Chinese]] [[Artistic gymnastics|artistic gymnast]] and the current team captain of the Chinese women's national artistic gymnastics team. She is best known for her innovative, quick connections and high degree of difficulty on balance beam and uneven bars. She is the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2018 World]] and [[2017 Asian Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2017 Asian]] champion on balance beam, and the [[Gymnastics at the 2018 Asian Games – Women's uneven bars|2018 Asian Games]] and [[2019 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2019 Chinese]] champion on the uneven bars. She has also competed in the all-around event for most her senior career. She is the [[2017 Asian Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2017 Asian]] and [[2019 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2019 Chinese]] champion in the all-around.

== Career ==

=== Junior ===
====2013====

Liu debuted at the national level when she competed at the senior-level [[2013 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2013 Chinese National Championships]]. Representing the province of Guangdong, she qualified in fifth place to the all-around final and seventh place to the balance beam final. She was initially the first reverse for the floor exercise final, but ultimately entered the final after Jiang Tong withdrew. In the team final, Liu contributed counting scores on all four events and ultimately won the silver medal. She then placed sixth in the all-around final, where she was the top-scoring junior. She concluded the competition by placing eighth in the balance beam final and fifth in the floor exercise final.

She also competed at the senior-level [[2013 National Games of China|2013 National Games]], a multi-sport event with nearly 10,000 participating athletes, where she placed fourth with her provincial team.

====2014: Junior National Champion====

Liu made her international debut the following year at the [[2014 Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championships|2014 Pacific Rim Championships]] in April, where she won a bronze medal with the team and qualified to all five junior individual finals. She recorded the fifth-highest total score in the junior individual all-around behind [[Bailie Key]], [[Nia Dennis]], and [[Norah Flatley]] of the United States and countrywoman [[Luo Huan]], although after Flatley's exclusion due to the two-per-country rule she placed fourth. She then placed third in the junior uneven bars final behind Luo and Key and seventh in the junior vault, balance beam, and floor exercise finals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2014/04/12/2014-pacific-rim-championships-results/|title=2014 Pacific Rim Championships Results|date=2014-04-12|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> These championships were the first of many events throughout Liu and Luo's careers where they competed together, often placing closely in the all-around and event finals.

Liu then competed at the senior-level [[2014 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2014 Chinese National Championships]] in May. She led her provincial team to the silver medal, once again contributing counting scores on every event. Her vault and uneven bars scores were both top-five among all gymnasts in the team final. She then placed ninth in the individual all-around final, sixth in the uneven bars final, and fifth in the floor exercise final. She won her first individual national medal by placing third in the balance beam final behind [[Shang Chunsong]] and [[Bai Yawen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2014/05/12/2014-chinese-championships-results/|title=2014 Chinese Championships Results|date=2014-05-12|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Liu dominated at her final competition of the year in June, the National Junior Championships. She won the all-around, uneven bars, and floor exercise titles, placed second on vault behind [[Liu Jinru]], and second on balance beam behind Zhang Wenxin.

====2015====

Liu's first major competition of the year was the [[2015 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2015 Chinese National Championships]] at the end of May, marking her third time competing at the senior-level championships. Liu qualified in second place to the all-around final, behind only [[Wang Yan (gymnast)|Wang Yan]], third place to the uneven bars final behind [[Fan Yilin]] and [[Tan Jiaxin]], and fourth place to the floor exercise final. In the team competition, Liu once again led the Guangdong provincial team to the podium, winning a team bronze medal. In the all-around final, a fall on the balance beam caused her to place sixth, although she was still the top-placing junior athlete ahead of [[Luo Huan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2015/06/04/shang-chunsong-finally-gets-national-gold/|title=Shang Chunsong Finally Gets National Gold|date=2015-06-04|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> In event finals, Liu placed eighth on uneven bars and fifth on floor exercise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2015/06/01/2015-chinese-championships-results/|title=2015 Chinese Championships Results|date=2015-06-01|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Liu then competed two weeks later at the national junior championships, entering as the defending champion. She qualified to the all-around final in first place and to all four event finals. She then placed second in the team final with her provincial team, which included [[Chen Yile]]. In the all-around final, Liu defended her title to win the gold medal, placing three points ahead of runner-up [[Luo Huan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golden-china.tumblr.com/post/122014525064/aa-results-and-videos-2015-chinese-junior-national|title=AA results and videos 2015 Chinese Junior National Championships|website=Golden China|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> In event finals, Liu performed very well. She placed first on balance beam, second on uneven bars behind Luo, third on vault behind [[Liu Jinru]] and [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]], and fourth on floor exercise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golden-china.tumblr.com/post/122105654374/ef-results-and-videos-2015-chinese-junior-national|title=EF results and videos 2015 Chinese Junior National Championships|website=Golden China|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> Interestingly, Liu Tingting, Luo Huan, Chen Yile, Zhang Jin, and Liu Jinru were the five members of the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|world championships team three years later]].

Based on her results at the senior- and junior-level national championships, Liu was selected to compete at the Junior Japan International in September, a major international meet for junior-level competitors. Although she was considered a podium threat for the all-around, mistakes on floor exercise in the all-around final ultimately resulted in a fifth-place finish. She then placed fifth in the uneven bars final, but then concluded her competition by rebounding to win the gold medal on the balance beam, ahead of American junior national champions [[Laurie Hernandez]] and [[Jazmyn Foberg]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2015/09/22/2015-junior-japan-international-results/|title=2015 Junior Japan International Results|date=2015-09-22|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> This marked Liu's first international gold medal.

Liu's final junior competition was the National Youth Games, a quadrennial multi-sport event for Chinese athletes under the age of 21, in October.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaaf.org/news/report/national-games-conclude-with-double-for-dong|title=National Games conclude with double for Dong Yanmei{{!}} News {{!}} iaaf.org|website=www.iaaf.org|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> Although Guangdong did not field a full team, Liu individually won gold medals in the all-around, uneven bars, and balance beam finals. She had the top score on every single event in the all-around final, and the highest difficulty score in both event finals. She also placed third on floor exercise. These results cemented Liu as a contender for the Chinese team in the coming Olympic year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2015/10/28/liu-dominates-chinese-youth-games/|title=Liu Dominates Chinese Youth Games|date=2015-10-28|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

=== Senior ===
====2016: Debut====

After competing at the junior level for three years nationally and two years internationally, Liu made her senior debut at just 15 years of age at the [[2016 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2016 Chinese National Championships]] in May. In the first round, Liu performed very well, qualifying to the all-around final in second place behind reigning national champion [[Shang Chunsong]] and to three event finals: bars in second place, beam in third place, and floor in sixth place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2016/05/16/2016-chinese-championships-results/|title=2016 Chinese Championships Results|last=Says|first=Salon De Massage Lyon|date=2016-05-16|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> In the all-around final, Liu fell on her double-twisting [[Yurchenko (vault)|Yurchenko]] vault and made mistakes on beam, ultimately finishing in third place by more than a point behind Shang and just two tenths behind [[Mao Yi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2016/05/13/shang-defends-national-championship-title/|title=Shang Defends National Championship Title|date=2016-05-14|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> In event finals, Liu won the silver medal on balance beam, once again behind Shang. She finished fifth on uneven bars after a mistake on her pirouette, and fifth on floor exercise with a clean routine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2016/05/15/chinese-nationals-conclude-with-event-finals/|title=Chinese Nationals Conclude with Event Finals|date=2016-05-16|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

The following week, Liu was named to the nominative roster for the 5-member Chinese [[Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Rio de Janeiro Olympic]] women's artistic gymnastics team along with [[2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2015 World Championships]] team members [[Shang Chunsong]], [[Mao Yi]], [[Fan Yilin]], and [[Wang Yan (gymnast)|Wang Yan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2016/05/16/shang-leads-chinas-olympic-nominative-team/|title=Shang Leads China’s Olympic Nominative Team|date=2016-05-16|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> However, on July 18, it was announced that she had suffered a hand injury while training on uneven bars and would be replaced by 19-year-old [[Tan Jiaxin]], a two-time World team silver medalist in [[2014 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2014]] and [[2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2015]]. Liu did not compete for the remainder of the season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.intlgymnast.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4619:tan-jiaxin-to-replace-liu-tingting-in-rio&catid=2:news&Itemid=53|title=Tan Jiaxin to Replace Liu Tingting in Rio|last=Turner|first=Amanda|website=International Gymnast Magazine Online|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

====2017: Asian All-Around Champion====

Liu's delayed senior international debut finally came at the [[2017 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series|2017 Melbourne World Cup]] in February, where she competed alongside Olympian [[Wang Yan (gymnast)|Wang Yan]] and [[Luo Huan]]. Liu qualified first on balance beam, second on floor exercise, and third on uneven bars. She went on to place first on uneven bars ahead of Huan and Rianna Mizzen of Australia, first on balance beam ahead of [[Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Women's balance beam|reigning Olympic Champion]] [[Sanne Wevers]] of the Netherlands and [[Emily Little]], and third on floor exercise behind Australians Little and [[Georgia Godwin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/02/22/2017-melbourne-world-cup-results/|title=2017 Melbourne World Cup Results|date=2017-02-22|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

In March, Liu competed again on the World Cup circuit alongside [[Wang Yan (gymnast)|Wang Yan]] and [[Luo Huan]], this time at the event in [[2017 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series|Doha]]. In qualifications, Liu once again advanced to three event finals by placing second on uneven bars, first on balance beam, and first on floor exercise. In event finals, she fell on uneven bars to place fourth behind Luo, [[Zsófia Kovács (gymnast)|Zsófia Kovács]] of Hungary, and [[Georgia-Rose Brown]] of Australia. She rebounded to win the gold medal on both balance beam, ahead of [[Gymnastics at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Women's balance beam|2004 Olympic Champion]] [[Cătălina Ponor|Catalina Ponor]] and Luo, and floor, ahead of [[Emily Little]] and Croatian [[Ana Đerek]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017-doha-world-cup/|title=2017 Doha World Cup|date=2017-02-25|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

In May, Liu competed the all-around for the first time in over a year at her fifth consecutive [[2017 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|Chinese National Championships]]. She qualified in third place to the all around final, competing a full-twisting Yurchenko vault as opposed to the double-twisting Yurchenko she competed in 2016, and qualified to the floor exercise final in first place. In the team final, Liu's Guangdong provincial team won gold by a large margin ahead of Beijing, marking Liu's first gold medal at the senior national championships. She was one of the favorites to win the all-around title along with top qualifiers [[Luo Huan]] and provincial teammate [[Chen Yile]], but pulled out of the all-around final after a minor injury.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/05/03/chinese-nationals-begin-this-weekend/|title=Chinese Nationals Begin This Weekend|date=2017-05-03|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> She returned for the floor exercise final and won the silver medal behind Olympian [[Shang Chunsong]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/05/06/2017-chinese-championships-results/|title=2017 Chinese Championships Results|date=2017-05-06|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Two weeks later, Liu competed at the [[2017 Asian Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2017 Asian Championships]] in [[Bangkok, Thailand]] as a member of the Chinese team alongside [[Luo Huan]], [[Liu Jinru]], and [[Tan Jiaxin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.agu-gymnastics.com/index.php/component/icagenda/33-7th-senior-art-asian-championships-in-bangkok-tha?Itemid=730|title=7th Senior ART Asian Championships in THA 2017|website=Asian Gymnastics Union|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> They won the team gold medal by nearly ten points ahead of North Korea and nearly 20 points ahead of Japan. In the all-around final, Liu recorded the top score on uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise to win the gold medal over reigning national all-around champion Luo and qualify in first place to those three event finals. This win marked Liu's first senior and first international all-around title. Her score on the balance beam in the all-around of 15.300 was the top international score on the apparatus of the entire 2017 season. In event finals, she placed second on uneven bars behind Luo, first on balance beam ahead of Luo, and fourth on floor exercise in a tie with Luo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/05/19/2017-asian-championships-results/|title=2017 Asian Championships Results|date=2017-05-19|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> These results made Liu, Luo, and [[Kim Su-jong|Kim Su-Jong]] of North Korea the most decorated female athletes of the championships, with four medals each.

In September, Liu was named to the nominative roster for the Chinese team for the [[2017 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2017 World Championships]] to compete the all-around alongside [[Luo Huan]], with specialists [[Wang Yan (gymnast)|Wang Yan]] and [[Fan Yilin]] rounding out the team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/09/04/i-cant-stop-myself-from-crying-chinas-worlds-team-and-retirements/|title=“I Can’t Stop Myself From Crying”: China’s Worlds Team and Retirements|date=2017-09-04|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> Shortly after, Liu competed as a member of the Guangdong provincial team at the [[2017 National Games of China|2017 National Games]]. She upgraded to a double-twisting Yurchenko vault for the first time since the [[2016 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2016 National Championships]] and contributed performances on all four events in the team final to the gold medal. In the all-around final, Liu recorded the top score on beam and won the silver medal behind junior provincial teammate [[Chen Yile]] and ahead of Wang and Luo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/09/08/china-looking-strong-for-worlds-and-beyond/|title=China Looking Strong For Worlds and Beyond|date=2017-09-08|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> In event finals, she placed eighth on bars, fourth on beam behind juniors Li Qi, Chen, and [[Tang Xijing]], and third on floor behind Wang and Chen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/09/01/2017-chinese-national-games-results/|title=2017 Chinese National Games Results|date=2017-09-01|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Although Liu was considered to be a contender for an all-around medal and a frontrunner for the balance beam title at the start of the [[2017 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Canada]], an ankle injury suffered during training limited Liu to just competing on the balance beam in the qualification round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/09/08/china-looking-strong-for-worlds-and-beyond/|title=China Looking Strong For Worlds and Beyond|date=2017-09-08|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golden-china.tumblr.com/post/165969389994/chinas-world-roster-again|title=Golden China|website=Golden China|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> While she qualified into the balance beam final in seventh place, she ultimately placed seventh in the final with a tentative routine due to her injury. While Liu's routine difficulty relied primarily on connecting many skills for bonuses, the injury forced her to pause between many of her skills. As such, her awarded difficulty score (5.5) was a full point less than the score she received when healthy (6.5) at the Asian Championships in May.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2017/10/25/the-montreal-balance-beam-final/|title=The Montreal Balance Beam Final|date=2017-10-26|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

====2018: World Balance Beam Champion====

Following recovery from her ankle injury, Liu competed in May at the [[2018 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2018 Chinese National Championships]] representing Guangdong province, although she did not compete floor exercise to avoid re-injuring her ankle. In qualification, Liu tied with new senior gymnast and teammate [[Chen Yile]] for fourth place on uneven bars and placed second on balance beam behind Chen to advance to both event finals. In the team finals, Guangdong repeated as champion, with Liu contributing scores on vault, uneven bars (recording the highest score of all competitors in the team final), and balance beam. In event finals, she placed sixth on both uneven bars and balance beam after mistakes in both finals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2018/05/09/2018-chinese-championships-results/|title=2018 Chinese Championships Results|date=2018-05-09|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

In August, Liu was named to the Chinese team for the [[Gymnastics at the 2018 Asian Games|2018 Asian Games]], a quadrennial multi-sport international competition with nearly 12,000 competitors, in [[Jakarta, Indonesia]]. Her teammates included [[Chen Yile]], [[Liu Jinru]], [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]], and Li Qi (who later withdrew and was replaced by reigning national champion [[Luo Huan]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golden-china.tumblr.com/post/176792896919/chinese-wag-asian-games-team|title=Golden China|website=Golden China|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golden-china.tumblr.com/post/177095531419/golden-china-the-rumour-is-li-qi-got-injured-on|title=Golden China|website=Golden China|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> In qualifications, Liu competed only on uneven bars, where she qualified in first place to the event final, and balance beam, where she scored the fourth-best score of all competitors, but did not qualify to the final as her teammates Chen, Zhang, and Luo all placed higher. In [[Gymnastics at the 2018 Asian Games – Women's artistic team|team finals]], Liu competed on vault instead of Chen, uneven bars, and balance beam, once again recording the highest score on uneven bars among all competitors. In the [[Gymnastics at the 2018 Asian Games – Women's uneven bars|event final]], she delivered yet another strong routine to win the Asian Games uneven bars title by nearly half a point ahead of runner-up Luo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2018/08/28/2018-asian-games-results/|title=2018 Asian Games Results|date=2018-08-28|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Following the Asian Games, the entire team including Liu were named to the roster for the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2018 World Championships]] in [[Doha|Doha, Qatar]]. In the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships#Qualification#Women's%20Results|qualification]] round, Liu placed eight on balance beam, second on the Chinese team (behind [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]]) to qualify for the event final after putting her hand down on her front tuck. She also placed ninth on uneven bars, second on the Chinese team (behind [[Luo Huan]]) and was named first alternate for that final. Overall, China qualified in third place to the team final, less than half a point behind Russia in second and more than nine points behind the United States in first place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2018/10/30/u-s-women-poised-for-fourth-straight-worlds-team-gold/|title=U.S. Women Poised for Fourth Straight Worlds Team Gold|date=2018-10-30|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

In the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships#Women's%20Results#Team|team final]], Liu had an error on uneven bars but performed well on the balance beam despite falls from teammates Chen and Zhang, tying with Japanese [[Mai Murakami]] for the third-highest score among all competitors in the team final after American [[Kara Eaker]] and French [[Marine Boyer]]. China won the team bronze medal behind the United States and Russia, earning Liu her first [[World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] medal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2018/11/06/2018-world-championships-results/|title=2018 World Championships Results|date=2018-11-06|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

In the balance beam event final, Liu competed last. The only competitor to have fully hit her routine, [[Ana Padurariu]] of Canada, sat at the top of the leaderboard, followed by [[Simone Biles]] of the United States who had made several smaller errors. Liu performed an exceptional routine featuring strong ring leaps and her signature front handspring-front tuck acrobatic series to take the gold medal in stunning fashion. Among the finalists, Liu earned both the highest difficulty (6.3) and the highest execution (8.233) scores, and she alone was awarded with her entire attempted connection value score.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2018/11/03/2018-world-championships-live-blog-event-finals-day-2/|title=2018 World Championships Live Blog {{!}} Event Finals Day 2|date=2018-11-03|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> Liu became the sixth Chinese woman to win the World balance beam title and the first since [[Sui Lu]] in 2011. She left the World Championships as the third most decorated female gymnast after Biles and [[Morgan Hurd]] of the United States.

==== 2019: National Champion ====

Liu competed at the [[2019 City of Jesolo Trophy]] in April alongside fellow World team member [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]] and first-year seniors [[Qi Qi (gymnast)|Qi Qi]] and [[Tang Xijing]] in [[Jesolo|Jesolo, Italy]]. There she won silver with the Chinese team, silver in the all-around behind [[Sunisa Lee]] of the United States, and gold in the balance beam final ahead of Americans [[Emma Malabuyo]] and Lee. She also placed fourth on the uneven bars behind Lee, Xijing, and [[Elisa Iorio]] of the home team Italy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2019/03/04/2019-city-of-jesolo-trophy-results/|title=2019 City of Jesolo Trophy Results|last=says|first=Nina|date=2019-03-04|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> Liu competed the all-around again after having not performed a floor exercise since the [[2017 National Games of China|2017 National Games]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2019/03/07/the-ten-biggest-jesolo-moments/|title=The Ten Biggest Jesolo Moments|date=2019-03-07|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Liu next competed at her seventh consecutive [[2019 Chinese Artistic Gymnastics Championships|Chinese National Championships]] in May, once again representing her provincial team of Guangdong. In the qualification round, Liu individually qualified to the all-around final in first place, the uneven bars final in second place behind two-time world champion [[Fan Yilin]], the balance beam final in third place behind junior [[Ou Yushan]] and [[Luo Huan]], and the floor exercise final tied for second place behind [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]]. In the team final, Liu contributed scores on all four events to lead Guangdong to its third straight team gold medal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2019/05/16/2019-chinese-championships-results/|title=2019 Chinese Championships Results|date=2019-05-16|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

In the all-around final, Liu hit all four of her routines cleanly and won her first senior Chinese national all-around title. Her score from the day of all-around competition was half a point higher than runner-up Luo and nearly a full point above bronze medalist Ou. During the all-around, she delivered the highest score on uneven bars, the third highest score on balance beam behind juniors Ou and [[Guan Chenchen]], and the fifth highest on floor exercise. In the event finals, Liu continued performing very well. She won the Chinese uneven bars title ahead of Cheng Shiyi and [[Ou Yushan]] after a major error from pre-final favorite [[Fan Yilin]], placed fourth on balance beam behind Ou, [[Tang Xijing]], and [[Qi Qi (gymnast)|Qi Qi]], and third on floor exercise behind [[Shang Chunsong]] and Ou.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2019/05/16/2019-chinese-championships-results/|title=2019 Chinese Championships Results|date=2019-05-16|website=The Gymternet|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>

Liu did not compete again until October, when she was named as the captain of the Chinese team for the [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2019 World Championships]] in [[Stuttgart|Stuttgart, Germany]] alongside [[Chen Yile]], [[Li Shijia]], [[Qi Qi (gymnast)|Qi Qi]], [[Tang Xijing]], and alternate [[Zhang Jin (gymnast)|Zhang Jin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sports.xinhuanet.com/c/2019-09/17/c_1125004487.htm|title=体操世锦赛中国队参赛名单揭晓-新华网体育|website=sports.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> This announcement made Liu the only Chinese gymnast to be a member of all three world championships teams during the 2017-2020 quadrennium.

In the [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships#Qualification#Women's results|qualification round]], Liu competed the all-around along with Li and Tang, contributing counting scores on uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise. As a team, China qualified in second place, behind the United States by roughly five points and ahead of third-place Russia by roughly one point. Individually, Liu recorded the sixth-highest all-around score, just ahead of her teammate Li, but qualified into the all-around in fifth place after [[Grace McCallum]]'s exclusion due to the two-per-country limit. Additionally, Liu qualified in sixth place to the uneven bars final (teammate Tang was the first alternate), and in third place to the balance beam final behind [[Simone Biles]] and Li.

In the team final, Liu performed below her usual standards. Competing last on uneven bars, she fell twice during her routine and scored nearly three points lower than her score in qualifications. On balance beam, another fall cost her roughly two points compared to her qualification routine. She rebounded on floor exercise, but her final routine was not enough to prevent China from finishing fourth behind the United States, Russia, and Italy.<ref name=TG100819>{{cite web|url=https://thegymter.net/2019/10/08/2019-world-championships-womens-team-final-live-blog/|title=2019 World Championships {{!}} Women’s Team Final Live Blog|date=October 8, 2019|first=Lauren|last=Hopkins|publisher=The Gymternet}}</ref> Liu withdrew from the all-around final and was replaced by Tang, who had been affected by the two-per-country rule.<ref name=OC100919>{{cite web|url=https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/stories/live/detail/artistic-gymnastics-world-championships-2019-live-9-october/|title=Artistic Gymnastics World Championships 2019 {{!}} Day 6 As It Happened|first1=ZK|last1=Goh|first2=Scott|last2=Bregman|publisher=[[Olympic Channel]]|date=October 9, 2019|quote=It appears that China's women's team captain, Liu Tingting, is out of the all-around final tomorrow.

'''Dominic Mckenzie Cummings''' (born 25 November 1971) is a British political strategist who has served as [[10 Downing Street#Prime Minister's Office|Chief Adviser]] to [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Boris Johnson]] since July 2019.

From 2007 to 2014, he was a [[Special adviser (UK)|Special Adviser]] to [[Michael Gove]], including while the latter served as [[Secretary of State for Education]], before he was dismissed by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]]. From 2015 to 2016, Cummings was [[Campaign manager|Director]] of the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign, an organisation opposed to continued British membership of the [[European Union]] that took an active part in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]] campaign for [[Brexit]].

==Early life==
Cummings was born in [[Durham, England|Durham]] on 25 November 1971. His father, Robert, had a varied career, but primarily built oil rigs for [[John Laing Group|Laing]], the construction firm. His mother, Morag, a university graduate, was a teacher and behavioural specialist.<ref name=\"Harry Lambert\">{{cite book |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/09/dominic-cummings-machiavel-downing-street |title=Dominic Cummings: The Machiavel in Downing Street | date=25 September 2019 | accessdate=17 December 2019 | author=[[Harry Lambert]]}}</ref> [[John Laws (judge)|Sir John Grant McKenzie Laws]], a former [[Court of Appeal judge (England and Wales)|Lord Justice of Appeal]], was his uncle.<ref name=\"The New Statesman\">{{cite news |last1=Lambert |first1=Harry |title=Dominic Cummings: The Machiavel in Downing Street |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/09/dominic-cummings-machiavel-downing-street |accessdate=16 December 2019 |work=The New Statesman |date=25 September 2019}}</ref>

On 24 July 2019, Cummings was appointed as a Senior Adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/controversial-ex-vote-leave-chief-dominic-cummings-to-join-boris-johnsons-team-in-number-10-11769523|title=Who is 'career psychopath' Dominic Cummings set to join Johnson's team?|website=Sky News|language=en|access-date=24 July 2019}}</ref>

On his appointment, ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that at a conference in 2017 Cummings had argued that: \"People think, and by the way I think most people are right: 'The Tory party is run by people who basically don't care about people like me{{' \"}}; and that \"Tory MPs largely do not care about these poorer people. They don't care about the NHS.

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported on Cummings's past rivalry with [[Nigel Farage]] from the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum campaign]], and quoted Farage as saying that: \"He has never liked me. He can't stand the [[European Research Group|ERG]]. I can't see him coming to any accommodation with anyone. He has huge personal enmity with the true believers in Brexit\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bennett |first1=Asa |title=Dominic Cummings and Nigel Farage: the Brexit referendum rivalry that continues to rage |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/07/31/dominic-cummings-nigel-farage-brexit-referendum-rivalry-continues/ |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=31 July 2019 | accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref>

Cummings was accused of hypocrisy when, not long after his appointment, it was revealed that a farm that he co-owns had received €250,000 (£235,000) in [[Common Agricultural Policy|EU farming subsidies]]. Cummings had previously described such subsidies as \"absurd\", complaining that some of them were handed out to \"very rich landowners to do stupid things\".<ref>{{Cite web |title= Brexit enforcer Cummings' farm took €235,000 in EU handouts |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/10/dominic-cummings-owns-farm-got-eu-subsidy |website=theguardian.com |date= 10 August 2019 |access-date= 1 August 2019 }}</ref>

In November 2019, a [[whistleblower]] raised questions about Cummings' interactions during his years in Russia; ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported that Whitehall was keeping certain government business from Cummings.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-asks-about-dominic-cummings-years-working-in-russia-vl6d0w62z|title=Labour asks about Dominic Cummings’ years working in Russia|newspaper=The Times|last1=Harper|first1=Tom|last2=Wheeler|first2=Caroline|date=3 November 2019|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>

As per procedure, Cummings temporarily resigned his role when [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament dissolved]] for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], along with most special advisers, but was briefly reinstated to assist the government during the [[2019 England floods|England Floods]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/27/general-election-leaders-try-to-steer-campaign-away-from-race-and-faith-live?page=with:block-5ddee3328f08cd6fe586d097#block-5ddee3328f08cd6fe586d097|title=YouGov poll suggests Tories on course for comfortable general election victory|last=Lyons|first=Kate|work=The Guardian|date=27 November 2019}}</ref>

After the election, in what was described as an \"unusual move\", Cummings called for people interested in working in government to contact him through a private [[Gmail]] address. In a blog post, he said he wanted to recruit data scientists, software developers and economists to help improve the performance of government, making his own role \"within a year largely redundant\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50978329|title=PM's senior aide Dominic Cummings calls for civil service changes|date=3 January 2020|work=BBC News|accessdate=3 January 2020}}</ref> The recruitment drive was reported to have resulted in several appointments on short-term contracts, including [[Alison Wolf, Baroness Wolf of Dulwich|Baroness Wolf of Dulwich]], Professor [[Vernon C.

It is increasingly important that Britain offers an example of civilised, democratic, liberal self-government\"<ref>{{cite news |title=An interview with Dominic Cummings |url=https://www.economist.com/bagehots-notebook/2016/01/21/an-interview-with-dominic-cummings |work=The Economist |date=21 January 2016}}</ref>}}

At an [[Ogilvy (agency)|Ogilvy]] conference in 2017, Cummings stated his belief that the EU, rather than solving issues, was fuelling radicalism and extremism due to a perceived lack of control over issues such as economy and immigration:
{{quote|\"For me ... the worst-case scenario for Europe is a return to 1930s-style protectionism and extremism. And to me the EU project, the Eurozone project, are driving the growth of extremism. The single most important reason, really, for why I wanted to get out of the EU is I think that it will drain the poison of a lot of political debates ... UKIP and Nigel Farage would be finished. Once there’s democratic control of immigration policy, immigration will go back to being a second- or third-order issue.\"<ref name=\"foreign policy\">{{cite news |first=Sahil |last=Handa |title=Can Dominic Cummings Banish Nativist Populism From U.K. Politics? |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/08/10/can-boris-johnsons-brexit-guru-banish-nativist-populism-from-british-politics/ |work=Foreign Policy |date=10 August 2019}}</ref>}}

Cummings has frequently attacked what he sees as a London-centred political system that failed to countenance the United Kingdom’s voting to leave the European Union. In December 2019, following the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|General Election]], which returned an 80-seat Conservative majority, he stated:
{{quote|\"After the shock of the referendum, MPs and journalists should have taken a breath and had a lot of self-reflection [on] why they misunderstood what was going on in the country. Instead a lot of people just doubled down on their own ideas and f***ed it up even more.

He has expressed his dismay that many voters' concerns, particularly in Northern England and the Midlands, have been ignored by both the Conservatives and Labour and 'taken for granted'.<ref name=\"timesdec19\"/> He criticised New Labour's attempt at re-balancing inherent structural deficiencies within the British economy following de-industrialisation with a system of tax credits.<ref name=\"timesdec19\"/>

'''Dominic Mckenzie Cummings''' (born 25 November 1971) is a British political strategist who has served as [[10 Downing Street#Prime Minister's Office|Chief Adviser]] to [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Boris Johnson]] since July 2019.

From 2007 to 2014, he was a [[Special adviser (UK)|Special Adviser]] to [[Michael Gove]], including while the latter served as [[Secretary of State for Education]], before he was dismissed by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]]. From 2015 to 2016, Cummings was [[Campaign manager|Director]] of the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign, an organisation opposed to continued British membership of the [[European Union]] that took an active part in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]] campaign for [[Brexit]].

==Early life==
Cummings was born in [[Durham, England|Durham]] on 25 November 1971. His father, Robert, had a varied career, but primarily built oil rigs for [[John Laing Group|Laing]], the construction firm. His mother, Morag, a university graduate, was a teacher and behavioural specialist.<ref name=\"Harry Lambert\">{{cite book |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/09/dominic-cummings-machiavel-downing-street |title=Dominic Cummings: The Machiavel in Downing Street | date=25 September 2019 | accessdate=17 December 2019 | author=[[Harry Lambert]]}}</ref> [[John Laws (judge)|Sir John Grant McKenzie Laws]], a former [[Court of Appeal judge (England and Wales)|Lord Justice of Appeal]], was his uncle.<ref name=\"The New Statesman\">{{cite news |last1=Lambert |first1=Harry |title=Dominic Cummings: The Machiavel in Downing Street |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/09/dominic-cummings-machiavel-downing-street |accessdate=16 December 2019 |work=The New Statesman |date=25 September 2019}}</ref>

After attending state primary school, he was educated at [[Durham School]] and [[Exeter College, Oxford]], where he studied under [[Norman Stone]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/jul/28/conservatives.politicalnews|title=Another fine mess|last=Hinsliff|first=Gaby|work=The Guardian|date=28 July 2002}}</ref> graduating in 1994 with a First in Ancient and Modern History.<ref name=\"conservativehome.com\"/> One of his professors has described him to the [[New Statesman]] as \"fizzing with ideas, unconvinced by any received set of views about anything\". He was \"something like a [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]]  – someone determined to bring down things that don’t work. A visionary\".<ref name=\"The New Statesman\"/> Also in his youth, he worked at Klute, a nightclub owned by his uncle in Durham.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Saunders |first1=Tom |title=Dominic Cummings: \"I wasn’t a bouncer, I just helped take money\" |url=https://www.palatinate.org.uk/dominic-cummings-i-wasnt-a-bouncer-i-just-helped-take-money/ |accessdate=27 January 2020 |publisher=Palitinate |date=27 July 2019}}</ref>

After university, Cummings moved to [[History of Russia (1991–present)|post-Soviet Russia]] from 1994 to 1997, working on various projects. In one Russian venture, he worked for a group attempting to set up an airline connecting [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] in southern Russia to [[Vienna]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/04/dominic-cummings-brilliant-eccentric-or-evil-genius-brexit-tv-drama-benedict-cumberbatch|title=Dominic Cummings: brilliant eccentric or evil genius?|last=Perraudin|first=Frances|date=4 January 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=3 January 2020|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In March 2019, the [[Commons Select Committee of Privileges]] recommended the House issue an admonishment for [[contempt of Parliament]] after Cummings failed to appear before the [[Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee]] inquiry into claims of false news during the referendum campaign.<ref>{{cite news |last1=BBC News |title=Vote Leave's Dominic Cummings 'in contempt of Parliament' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47712040 |accessdate=27 July 2019 |agency=BBC |date=27 March 2019}}</ref> The resolution admonishing him was passed by resolution of the House of Commons on 2 April 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Privileges – Hansard |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-04-02/debates/B24A6227-E736-4100-8DDF-9CE02A37A533/Privileges?highlight=cummings%20contempt |website=hansard.parliament.uk}}</ref>

In July 2017, the lawyer and political commentator, [[David Allen Green]], asked Cummings via Twitter, \"Is there anything which could now happen (or not happen) which would make you now wish Leave had not won the referendum result?\" Cummings replied, \"Lots! I said before REF was dumb idea, other things shdve been tried 1st.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Freedland |first1=Jonathan |title=Is Brexit an error?

===Senior Adviser to Boris Johnson (2019–present) ===
[[File:Peoples Vote March October 3959 Demonic Cummings sculpture.jpg|thumb|Effigy of Cummings as [[Boris Johnson]]'s puppet-master at the [[People's Vote]] march, in October 2019]]

On 24 July 2019, Cummings was appointed as a Senior Adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/controversial-ex-vote-leave-chief-dominic-cummings-to-join-boris-johnsons-team-in-number-10-11769523|title=Who is 'career psychopath' Dominic Cummings set to join Johnson's team?|website=Sky News|language=en|access-date=24 July 2019}}</ref>

On his appointment, ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that at a conference in 2017 Cummings had argued that: \"People think, and by the way I think most people are right: 'The Tory party is run by people who basically don't care about people like me{{' \"}}; and that \"Tory MPs largely do not care about these poorer people. They don't care about the NHS. And the public has kind of cottoned on to that\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/30/dominic-cummings-tories-do-not-care-about-poor-people-or-the-nhs|title=Dominic Cummings: Tory MPs do not care about poor people or NHS|last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=30 July 2019|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=31 July 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported on Cummings's past rivalry with [[Nigel Farage]] from the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum campaign]], and quoted Farage as saying that: \"He has never liked me. He can't stand the [[European Research Group|ERG]]. I can't see him coming to any accommodation with anyone. He has huge personal enmity with the true believers in Brexit\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bennett |first1=Asa |title=Dominic Cummings and Nigel Farage: the Brexit referendum rivalry that continues to rage |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/07/31/dominic-cummings-nigel-farage-brexit-referendum-rivalry-continues/ |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=31 July 2019 | accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref>

Cummings was accused of hypocrisy when, not long after his appointment, it was revealed that a farm that he co-owns had received €250,000 (£235,000) in [[Common Agricultural Policy|EU farming subsidies]]. Cummings had previously described such subsidies as \"absurd\", complaining that some of them were handed out to \"very rich landowners to do stupid things\".<ref>{{Cite web |title= Brexit enforcer Cummings' farm took €235,000 in EU handouts |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/10/dominic-cummings-owns-farm-got-eu-subsidy |website=theguardian.com |date= 10 August 2019 |access-date= 1 August 2019 }}</ref>

In November 2019, a [[whistleblower]] raised questions about Cummings' interactions during his years in Russia; ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported that Whitehall was keeping certain government business from Cummings.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-asks-about-dominic-cummings-years-working-in-russia-vl6d0w62z|title=Labour asks about Dominic Cummings’ years working in Russia|newspaper=The Times|last1=Harper|first1=Tom|last2=Wheeler|first2=Caroline|date=3 November 2019|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>

As per procedure, Cummings temporarily resigned his role when [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament dissolved]] for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], along with most special advisers, but was briefly reinstated to assist the government during the [[2019 England floods|England Floods]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/27/general-election-leaders-try-to-steer-campaign-away-from-race-and-faith-live?page=with:block-5ddee3328f08cd6fe586d097#block-5ddee3328f08cd6fe586d097|title=YouGov poll suggests Tories on course for comfortable general election victory|last=Lyons|first=Kate|work=The Guardian|date=27 November 2019}}</ref>

According to ''[[Politico]]'', Cummings played a role in the Conservative Party's victory in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]],<ref>{{cite web | last1=Dickson | first1=Annabelle | last2=Casalicchio | first2=Emilio | last3=Blanchard | first3=Jack | last4=Courea | first4=Eleni | title=We’re all living in Dominic Cummings' world now | url=https://www.politico.eu/article/dominic-cummings-uk-electio-2019-strategy-conservative-victory/ | date=13 December 2019 | work=[[Politico]] | accessdate=14 December 2019}}</ref> despite having passed the party's running of the election campaign to [[Isaac Levido]]. After the election, in what was described as an \"unusual move\", Cummings called for people interested in working in government to contact him through a private [[Gmail]] address. In a blog post, he said he wanted to recruit data scientists, software developers and economists to help improve the performance of government, making his own role \"within a year largely redundant\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50978329|title=PM's senior aide Dominic Cummings calls for civil service changes|date=3 January 2020|work=BBC News|accessdate=3 January 2020}}</ref> The recruitment drive was reported to have resulted in several appointments on short-term contracts, including [[Alison Wolf, Baroness Wolf of Dulwich|Baroness Wolf of Dulwich]], Professor [[Vernon C.

===Controversies===
====Civil servant's bullying case====
In 2012, a senior female civil servant received a payout of £25,000 in a bullying case she took against Cummings and a senior member of Michael Gove’s team, when Cummings was a special adviser at the Department for Education.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/15/boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-backlash-sacking-sonia-khan|title=Cummings and Johnson face backlash over sacking of advisers|last=Helm|first=Toby|date=15 February 2020|work=The Guardian|accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>

====Sonia Khan’s dismissal====
On 31 August 2019, ''The Guardian'' reported that Cummings had fired one of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Sajid Javid]]'s aides, Sonia Khan, without Javid's permission and without informing him. Allegedly, \"Having summoned her to No 10 on Thursday evening to question her, Cummings took her two phones, one used for private calls and one for work, and fired her after seeing she had talked to an ex-aide to [[Philip Hammond]] the previous week. Cummings then went outside No 10 and asked an armed officer to enter the building and escort Khan off the premises.\"<ref>{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/31/boris-johnson-must-launch-inquiry-dominic-cummings-reign-of-terror |title=PM 'must launch urgent inquiry into Dominic Cummings’s reign of terror'|first1=Toby |last1=Helm|first2=Mark |last2=Townsend|date=1 September 2019|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> The following month, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that Cummings had \"seized new powers to sack ministers' advisers\", as their new employment contracts stipulated that responsibility for disciplinary matters rested with the Prime Minister's [[Downing Street Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] as well as with their respective ministers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/dominic-cummings-cements-his-power-to-sack-advisers-m6q77gkxd|title=Dominic Cummings cements his power to sack advisers|last=Zeffman|first=Henry|date=18 September 2019|work=The Times|accessdate=18 September 2019}}</ref>

====Coronavirus pandemic====
In March 2020, it was reported in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that during a private engagement the previous month, Cummings had claimed that the government's strategy towards the coronavirus was \"herd immunity, protect the economy and if that means some pensioners die, too bad\". The spokesman for [[10 Downing Street]] decried the article as \"a highly defamatory fabrication\" which \"includes a series of apparent quotes from meetings which are invented\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Walker |first1=Peter |title=No 10 denies claim Dominic Cummings argued to 'let old people die' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/22/no-10-denies-claim-dominic-cummings-argued-to-let-old-people-die |accessdate=22 March 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=22 March 2020}}</ref>  On 30 March, Cummings displayed symptoms of [[COVID-19]] during the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]] and is reported to be self isolating. This was three days after Johnson was tested positive for the virus.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dominic-cummings-coronavirus-test-symptoms-positive-latest-a9433331.html|first=Lizzy|last=Buchan|title=Dominic Cummings self-isolates after he develops coronavirus symptoms|work=The Independent|date=30 March 2020|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>

==Political views==
Cummings has described his political views as \"not Tory (Conservative), libertarian, 'populist' or anything else\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-cummings-insight/an-archetypal-rebel-how-johnsons-chief-adviser-is-driving-brexit-idUKKCN1UY0ML|work=[[Reuters]]|title=An archetypal rebel - how Johnson's chief adviser is driving Brexit|last=Piper|first=Elizabeth|date=8 August 2019|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>

In January 2016, five months prior to the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union referendum]] in the United Kingdom, Cummings said:
{{quote|\"Extremists are on the rise in Europe and are being fuelled unfortunately by the Euro project and by the centralisation of power in Brussels. It is increasingly important that Britain offers an example of civilised, democratic, liberal self-government\"<ref>{{cite news |title=An interview with Dominic Cummings |url=https://www.economist.com/bagehots-notebook/2016/01/21/an-interview-with-dominic-cummings |work=The Economist |date=21 January 2016}}</ref>}}

At an [[Ogilvy (agency)|Ogilvy]] conference in 2017, Cummings stated his belief that the EU, rather than solving issues, was fuelling radicalism and extremism due to a perceived lack of control over issues such as economy and immigration:
{{quote|\"For me ... the worst-case scenario for Europe is a return to 1930s-style protectionism and extremism. And to me the EU project, the Eurozone project, are driving the growth of extremism. The single most important reason, really, for why I wanted to get out of the EU is I think that it will drain the poison of a lot of political debates ... UKIP and Nigel Farage would be finished. Once there’s democratic control of immigration policy, immigration will go back to being a second- or third-order issue.\"<ref name=\"foreign policy\">{{cite news |first=Sahil |last=Handa |title=Can Dominic Cummings Banish Nativist Populism From U.K. Politics? |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/08/10/can-boris-johnsons-brexit-guru-banish-nativist-populism-from-british-politics/ |work=Foreign Policy |date=10 August 2019}}</ref>}}

Cummings has frequently attacked what he sees as a London-centred political system that failed to countenance the United Kingdom’s voting to leave the European Union. In December 2019, following the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|General Election]], which returned an 80-seat Conservative majority, he stated:
{{quote|\"After the shock of the referendum, MPs and journalists should have taken a breath and had a lot of self-reflection [on] why they misunderstood what was going on in the country. Instead a lot of people just doubled down on their own ideas and f***ed it up even more. That’s why something like this happens against expectations.\"<ref name=\"timesdec19\">{{Cite web |last=Wright |first=Oliver |title=Dominic Cummings: Educated Remainer types failed to read mood of the country |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dominic-cummings-educated-remainer-types-failed-to-read-mood-of-the-country-fq0xp5g3k |work=The Times |date=14 December 2019 |accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>}}

He has expressed his dismay that many voters' concerns, particularly in Northern England and the Midlands, have been ignored by both the Conservatives and Labour and 'taken for granted'.<ref name=\"timesdec19\"/> He criticised New Labour's attempt at re-balancing inherent structural deficiencies within the British economy following de-industrialisation with a system of tax credits.<ref name=\"timesdec19\"/>

'''Dominic Mckenzie Cummings''' (born 25 November 1971) is a British political strategist who has served as [[10 Downing Street#Prime Minister's Office|Chief Adviser]] to [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Boris Johnson]] since July 2019.

From 2007 to 2014, he was a [[Special adviser (UK)|Special Adviser]] to [[Michael Gove]], including while the latter served as [[Secretary of State for Education]], before he was dismissed by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]]. From 2015 to 2016, Cummings was [[Campaign manager|Director]] of the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign, an organisation opposed to continued British membership of the [[European Union]] that took an active part in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]] campaign for [[Brexit]].

==Early life==
Cummings was born in [[Durham, England|Durham]] on 25 November 1971. His father, Robert, had a varied career, but primarily built oil rigs for [[John Laing Group|Laing]], the construction firm.

On 24 July 2019, Cummings was appointed as a Senior Adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/controversial-ex-vote-leave-chief-dominic-cummings-to-join-boris-johnsons-team-in-number-10-11769523|title=Who is 'career psychopath' Dominic Cummings set to join Johnson's team?|website=Sky News|language=en|access-date=24 July 2019}}</ref>

On his appointment, ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that at a conference in 2017 Cummings had argued that: \"People think, and by the way I think most people are right: 'The Tory party is run by people who basically don't care about people like me{{' \"}}; and that \"Tory MPs largely do not care about these poorer people. They don't care about the NHS.

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported on Cummings's past rivalry with [[Nigel Farage]] from the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum campaign]], and quoted Farage as saying that: \"He has never liked me. He can't stand the [[European Research Group|ERG]]. I can't see him coming to any accommodation with anyone.

Cummings was accused of hypocrisy when, not long after his appointment, it was revealed that a farm that he co-owns had received €250,000 (£235,000) in [[Common Agricultural Policy|EU farming subsidies]]. Cummings had previously described such subsidies as \"absurd\", complaining that some of them were handed out to \"very rich landowners to do stupid things\".<ref>{{Cite web |title= Brexit enforcer Cummings' farm took €235,000 in EU handouts |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/10/dominic-cummings-owns-farm-got-eu-subsidy |website=theguardian.com |date= 10 August 2019 |access-date= 1 August 2019 }}</ref>

In November 2019, a [[whistleblower]] raised questions about Cummings' interactions during his years in Russia; ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported that Whitehall was keeping certain government business from Cummings.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-asks-about-dominic-cummings-years-working-in-russia-vl6d0w62z|title=Labour asks about Dominic Cummings’ years working in Russia|newspaper=The Times|last1=Harper|first1=Tom|last2=Wheeler|first2=Caroline|date=3 November 2019|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>

As per procedure, Cummings temporarily resigned his role when [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament dissolved]] for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], along with most special advisers, but was briefly reinstated to assist the government during the [[2019 England floods|England Floods]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/27/general-election-leaders-try-to-steer-campaign-away-from-race-and-faith-live?page=with:block-5ddee3328f08cd6fe586d097#block-5ddee3328f08cd6fe586d097|title=YouGov poll suggests Tories on course for comfortable general election victory|last=Lyons|first=Kate|work=The Guardian|date=27 November 2019}}</ref>

After the election, in what was described as an \"unusual move\", Cummings called for people interested in working in government to contact him through a private [[Gmail]] address. In a blog post, he said he wanted to recruit data scientists, software developers and economists to help improve the performance of government, making his own role \"within a year largely redundant\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50978329|title=PM's senior aide Dominic Cummings calls for civil service changes|date=3 January 2020|work=BBC News|accessdate=3 January 2020}}</ref> The recruitment drive was reported to have resulted in several appointments on short-term contracts, including [[Alison Wolf, Baroness Wolf of Dulwich|Baroness Wolf of Dulwich]], Professor [[Vernon C.

====Coronavirus pandemic====
In March 2020, it was reported in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that during a private engagement the previous month, Cummings had claimed that the government's strategy towards the coronavirus was \"herd immunity, protect the economy and if that means some pensioners die, too bad\". The spokesman for [[10 Downing Street]] decried the article as \"a highly defamatory fabrication\" which \"includes a series of apparent quotes from meetings which are invented\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Walker |first1=Peter |title=No 10 denies claim Dominic Cummings argued to 'let old people die' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/22/no-10-denies-claim-dominic-cummings-argued-to-let-old-people-die |accessdate=22 March 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=22 March 2020}}</ref>  On 30 March, Cummings displayed symptoms of [[COVID-19]] during the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]] and is reported to be self isolating.

==Political views==
Cummings has described his political views as \"not Tory (Conservative), libertarian, 'populist' or anything else\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-cummings-insight/an-archetypal-rebel-how-johnsons-chief-adviser-is-driving-brexit-idUKKCN1UY0ML|work=[[Reuters]]|title=An archetypal rebel - how Johnson's chief adviser is driving Brexit|last=Piper|first=Elizabeth|date=8 August 2019|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>

In January 2016, five months prior to the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union referendum]] in the United Kingdom, Cummings said:
{{quote|\"Extremists are on the rise in Europe and are being fuelled unfortunately by the Euro project and by the centralisation of power in Brussels.

At an [[Ogilvy (agency)|Ogilvy]] conference in 2017, Cummings stated his belief that the EU, rather than solving issues, was fuelling radicalism and extremism due to a perceived lack of control over issues such as economy and immigration:

Cummings has frequently attacked what he sees as a London-centred political system that failed to countenance the United Kingdom’s voting to leave the European Union. In December 2019, following the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|General Election]], which returned an 80-seat Conservative majority, he stated:
{{quote|\"After the shock of the referendum, MPs and journalists should have taken a breath and had a lot of self-reflection [on] why they misunderstood what was going on in the country.

'''Dominic Mckenzie Cummings''' (born 25 November 1971) is a British political strategist who has served as [[10 Downing Street#Prime Minister's Office|Chief Adviser]] to [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Boris Johnson]] since July 2019.

From 2007 to 2014, he was a [[Special adviser (UK)|Special Adviser]] to [[Michael Gove]], including while the latter served as [[Secretary of State for Education]], before he was dismissed by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]]. From 2015 to 2016, Cummings was [[Campaign manager|Director]] of the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign, an organisation opposed to continued British membership of the [[European Union]] that took an active part in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]] campaign for [[Brexit]].

==Early life==
Cummings was born in [[Durham, England|Durham]] on 25 November 1971. His father, Robert, had a varied career, but primarily built oil rigs for [[John Laing Group|Laing]], the construction firm. His mother, Morag, a university graduate, was a teacher and behavioural specialist.<ref name=\"Harry Lambert\">{{cite book |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/09/dominic-cummings-machiavel-downing-street |title=Dominic Cummings: The Machiavel in Downing Street | date=25 September 2019 | accessdate=17 December 2019 | author=[[Harry Lambert]]}}</ref> [[John Laws (judge)|Sir John Grant McKenzie Laws]], a former [[Court of Appeal judge (England and Wales)|Lord Justice of Appeal]], was his uncle.<ref name=\"The New Statesman\">{{cite news |last1=Lambert |first1=Harry |title=Dominic Cummings: The Machiavel in Downing Street |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/09/dominic-cummings-machiavel-downing-street |accessdate=16 December 2019 |work=The New Statesman |date=25 September 2019}}</ref>

After attending state primary school, he was educated at [[Durham School]] and [[Exeter College, Oxford]], where he studied under [[Norman Stone]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/jul/28/conservatives.politicalnews|title=Another fine mess|last=Hinsliff|first=Gaby|work=The Guardian|date=28 July 2002}}</ref> graduating in 1994 with a First in Ancient and Modern History.<ref name=\"conservativehome.com\"/> One of his professors has described him as \"fizzing with ideas, unconvinced by any received set of views about anything\". He was \"something like a [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]]  – someone determined to bring down things that don’t work. A visionary\".<ref name=\"The New Statesman\"/> Also in his youth, he worked at Klute, a nightclub owned by his uncle in Durham.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Saunders |first1=Tom |title=Dominic Cummings: \"I wasn’t a bouncer, I just helped take money\" |url=https://www.palatinate.org.uk/dominic-cummings-i-wasnt-a-bouncer-i-just-helped-take-money/ |accessdate=27 January 2020 |publisher=Palitinate |date=27 July 2019}}</ref>

After university, Cummings moved to [[History of Russia (1991–present)|post-Soviet Russia]] from 1994 to 1997, working on various projects. In one Russian venture, he worked for a group attempting to set up an airline connecting [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] in southern Russia to [[Vienna]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/04/dominic-cummings-brilliant-eccentric-or-evil-genius-brexit-tv-drama-benedict-cumberbatch|title=Dominic Cummings: brilliant eccentric or evil genius?|last=Perraudin|first=Frances|date=4 January 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=3 January 2020|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In March 2019, the [[Commons Select Committee of Privileges]] recommended the House issue an admonishment for [[contempt of Parliament]] after Cummings failed to appear before the [[Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee]] inquiry into claims of false news during the referendum campaign.<ref>{{cite news |last1=BBC News |title=Vote Leave's Dominic Cummings 'in contempt of Parliament' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47712040 |accessdate=27 July 2019 |agency=BBC |date=27 March 2019}}</ref> The resolution admonishing him was passed by resolution of the House of Commons on 2 April 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Privileges – Hansard |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-04-02/debates/B24A6227-E736-4100-8DDF-9CE02A37A533/Privileges?highlight=cummings%20contempt |website=hansard.parliament.uk}}</ref>

In July 2017, the lawyer and political commentator, [[David Allen Green]], asked Cummings via Twitter, \"Is there anything which could now happen (or not happen) which would make you now wish Leave had not won the referendum result?\" Cummings replied, \"Lots! I said before REF was dumb idea, other things shdve been tried 1st.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Freedland |first1=Jonathan |title=Is Brexit an error?

===Senior Adviser to Boris Johnson (2019–present) ===
[[File:Peoples Vote March October 3959 Demonic Cummings sculpture.jpg|thumb|Effigy of Cummings as [[Boris Johnson]]'s puppet-master at the [[People's Vote]] march, in October 2019]]

On 24 July 2019, Cummings was appointed as a Senior Adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/controversial-ex-vote-leave-chief-dominic-cummings-to-join-boris-johnsons-team-in-number-10-11769523|title=Who is 'career psychopath' Dominic Cummings set to join Johnson's team?|website=Sky News|language=en|access-date=24 July 2019}}</ref>

On his appointment, ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that at a conference in 2017 Cummings had argued that: \"People think, and by the way I think most people are right: 'The Tory party is run by people who basically don't care about people like me{{' \"}}; and that \"Tory MPs largely do not care about these poorer people. They don't care about the NHS. And the public has kind of cottoned on to that\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/30/dominic-cummings-tories-do-not-care-about-poor-people-or-the-nhs|title=Dominic Cummings: Tory MPs do not care about poor people or NHS|last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=30 July 2019|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=31 July 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported on Cummings's past rivalry with [[Nigel Farage]] from the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum campaign]], and quoted Farage as saying that: \"He has never liked me. He can't stand the [[European Research Group|ERG]]. I can't see him coming to any accommodation with anyone. He has huge personal enmity with the true believers in Brexit\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bennett |first1=Asa |title=Dominic Cummings and Nigel Farage: the Brexit referendum rivalry that continues to rage |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/07/31/dominic-cummings-nigel-farage-brexit-referendum-rivalry-continues/ |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=31 July 2019 | accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref>

Cummings was accused of hypocrisy when, not long after his appointment, it was revealed that a farm that he co-owns had received €250,000 (£235,000) in [[Common Agricultural Policy|EU farming subsidies]]. Cummings had previously described such subsidies as \"absurd\", complaining that some of them were handed out to \"very rich landowners to do stupid things\".<ref>{{Cite web |title= Brexit enforcer Cummings' farm took €235,000 in EU handouts |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/10/dominic-cummings-owns-farm-got-eu-subsidy |website=theguardian.com |date= 10 August 2019 |access-date= 1 August 2019 }}</ref>

In November 2019, a [[whistleblower]] raised questions about Cummings' interactions during his years in Russia; ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported that Whitehall was keeping certain government business from Cummings.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-asks-about-dominic-cummings-years-working-in-russia-vl6d0w62z|title=Labour asks about Dominic Cummings’ years working in Russia|newspaper=The Times|last1=Harper|first1=Tom|last2=Wheeler|first2=Caroline|date=3 November 2019|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>

As per procedure, Cummings temporarily resigned his role when [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament dissolved]] for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], along with most special advisers, but was briefly reinstated to assist the government during the [[2019 England floods|England Floods]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/27/general-election-leaders-try-to-steer-campaign-away-from-race-and-faith-live?page=with:block-5ddee3328f08cd6fe586d097#block-5ddee3328f08cd6fe586d097|title=YouGov poll suggests Tories on course for comfortable general election victory|last=Lyons|first=Kate|work=The Guardian|date=27 November 2019}}</ref>

According to ''[[Politico]]'', Cummings played a role in the Conservative Party's victory in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]],<ref>{{cite web | last1=Dickson | first1=Annabelle | last2=Casalicchio | first2=Emilio | last3=Blanchard | first3=Jack | last4=Courea | first4=Eleni | title=We’re all living in Dominic Cummings' world now | url=https://www.politico.eu/article/dominic-cummings-uk-electio-2019-strategy-conservative-victory/ | date=13 December 2019 | work=[[Politico]] | accessdate=14 December 2019}}</ref> despite having passed the party's running of the election campaign to [[Isaac Levido]]. After the election, in what was described as an \"unusual move\", Cummings called for people interested in working in government to contact him through a private [[Gmail]] address. In a blog post, he said he wanted to recruit data scientists, software developers and economists to help improve the performance of government, making his own role \"within a year largely redundant\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50978329|title=PM's senior aide Dominic Cummings calls for civil service changes|date=3 January 2020|work=BBC News|accessdate=3 January 2020}}</ref> The recruitment drive was reported to have resulted in several appointments on short-term contracts, including [[Alison Wolf, Baroness Wolf of Dulwich|Baroness Wolf of Dulwich]], Professor [[Vernon C.

===Controversies===
====Civil servant's bullying case====
In 2012, a senior female civil servant received a payout of £25,000 in a bullying case she took against Cummings and a senior member of Michael Gove’s team, when Cummings was a special adviser at the Department for Education.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/15/boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-backlash-sacking-sonia-khan|title=Cummings and Johnson face backlash over sacking of advisers|last=Helm|first=Toby|date=15 February 2020|work=The Guardian|accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>

====Sonia Khan’s dismissal====
On 31 August 2019, ''The Guardian'' reported that Cummings had fired one of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Sajid Javid]]'s aides, Sonia Khan, without Javid's permission and without informing him. Allegedly, \"Having summoned her to No 10 on Thursday evening to question her, Cummings took her two phones, one used for private calls and one for work, and fired her after seeing she had talked to an ex-aide to [[Philip Hammond]] the previous week. Cummings then went outside No 10 and asked an armed officer to enter the building and escort Khan off the premises.\"<ref>{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/31/boris-johnson-must-launch-inquiry-dominic-cummings-reign-of-terror |title=PM 'must launch urgent inquiry into Dominic Cummings’s reign of terror'|first1=Toby |last1=Helm|first2=Mark |last2=Townsend|date=1 September 2019|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> The following month, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that Cummings had \"seized new powers to sack ministers' advisers\", as their new employment contracts stipulated that responsibility for disciplinary matters rested with the Prime Minister's [[Downing Street Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] as well as with their respective ministers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/dominic-cummings-cements-his-power-to-sack-advisers-m6q77gkxd|title=Dominic Cummings cements his power to sack advisers|last=Zeffman|first=Henry|date=18 September 2019|work=The Times|accessdate=18 September 2019}}</ref>

====Coronavirus pandemic====
In March 2020, it was reported in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that during a private engagement the previous month, Cummings had claimed that the government's strategy towards the coronavirus was \"herd immunity, protect the economy and if that means some pensioners die, too bad\". The spokesman for [[10 Downing Street]] decried the article as \"a highly defamatory fabrication\" which \"includes a series of apparent quotes from meetings which are invented\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Walker |first1=Peter |title=No 10 denies claim Dominic Cummings argued to 'let old people die' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/22/no-10-denies-claim-dominic-cummings-argued-to-let-old-people-die |accessdate=22 March 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=22 March 2020}}</ref>  On 30 March, Cummings displayed symptoms of [[COVID-19]] during the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]] and is reported to be self isolating. This was three days after Johnson was tested positive for the virus.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dominic-cummings-coronavirus-test-symptoms-positive-latest-a9433331.html|first=Lizzy|last=Buchan|title=Dominic Cummings self-isolates after he develops coronavirus symptoms|work=The Independent|date=30 March 2020|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>

==Political views==
Cummings has described his political views as \"not Tory (Conservative), libertarian, 'populist' or anything else\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-cummings-insight/an-archetypal-rebel-how-johnsons-chief-adviser-is-driving-brexit-idUKKCN1UY0ML|work=[[Reuters]]|title=An archetypal rebel - how Johnson's chief adviser is driving Brexit|last=Piper|first=Elizabeth|date=8 August 2019|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>

In January 2016, five months prior to the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union referendum]] in the United Kingdom, Cummings said:
{{quote|\"Extremists are on the rise in Europe and are being fuelled unfortunately by the Euro project and by the centralisation of power in Brussels. It is increasingly important that Britain offers an example of civilised, democratic, liberal self-government\"<ref>{{cite news |title=An interview with Dominic Cummings |url=https://www.economist.com/bagehots-notebook/2016/01/21/an-interview-with-dominic-cummings |work=The Economist |date=21 January 2016}}</ref>}}

At an [[Ogilvy (agency)|Ogilvy]] conference in 2017, Cummings stated his belief that the EU, rather than solving issues, was fuelling radicalism and extremism due to a perceived lack of control over issues such as economy and immigration:
{{quote|\"For me ... the worst-case scenario for Europe is a return to 1930s-style protectionism and extremism. And to me the EU project, the Eurozone project, are driving the growth of extremism. The single most important reason, really, for why I wanted to get out of the EU is I think that it will drain the poison of a lot of political debates ... UKIP and Nigel Farage would be finished. Once there’s democratic control of immigration policy, immigration will go back to being a second- or third-order issue.\"<ref name=\"foreign policy\">{{cite news |first=Sahil |last=Handa |title=Can Dominic Cummings Banish Nativist Populism From U.K. Politics? |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/08/10/can-boris-johnsons-brexit-guru-banish-nativist-populism-from-british-politics/ |work=Foreign Policy |date=10 August 2019}}</ref>}}

Cummings has frequently attacked what he sees as a London-centred political system that failed to countenance the United Kingdom’s voting to leave the European Union. In December 2019, following the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|General Election]], which returned an 80-seat Conservative majority, he stated:
{{quote|\"After the shock of the referendum, MPs and journalists should have taken a breath and had a lot of self-reflection [on] why they misunderstood what was going on in the country. Instead a lot of people just doubled down on their own ideas and f***ed it up even more. That’s why something like this happens against expectations.\"<ref name=\"timesdec19\">{{Cite web |last=Wright |first=Oliver |title=Dominic Cummings: Educated Remainer types failed to read mood of the country |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dominic-cummings-educated-remainer-types-failed-to-read-mood-of-the-country-fq0xp5g3k |work=The Times |date=14 December 2019 |accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>}}

He has expressed his dismay that many voters' concerns, particularly in Northern England and the Midlands, have been ignored by both the Conservatives and Labour and 'taken for granted'.<ref name=\"timesdec19\"/> He criticised New Labour's attempt at re-balancing inherent structural deficiencies within the British economy following de-industrialisation with a system of tax credits.<ref name=\"timesdec19\"/>

The Nissan Rogue made its debut at the [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]] on January 7, 2007. It replaces the [[Nissan X-Trail]] in [[Canada]] as Nissan's entry-level [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] and the [[body-on-frame]] [[Nissan Xterra]] in [[Mexico]] due to the Smyrna plant freeing capacity for the 2009 [[Suzuki Equator]], but the [[Nissan Xterra|Xterra]] continued on sale in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] through 2015 after being withdrawn from the Mexican market after the 2008 model year.

===Initial release===

===Rogue Select===
The Select was a continuation of the first generation Rogue sold alongside an all-new Rogue that went on sale in 2013 as a 2014 model.  Since the production capacity allowed for the first generation to be built in conjunction with the 2nd generation, it allowed for a lower entry price to Rogue customers as well as fleet sales. It went on sale in January 2014 as a 2014 model year vehicle and was continued through 2015.  Nissan then announced that 2015 would be the final year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/09/28/nissan-to-sell-current-and-future-rogue-models-simultaneously/|title=Nissan's current Rogue renamed Rogue Select, will live alongside next gen|website=autoblog.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907181702/https://www.autoblog.com/2013/09/28/nissan-to-sell-current-and-future-rogue-models-simultaneously/|archivedate=7 September 2017}}</ref> The Rogue Select was not offered in Canada.

The second generation Rogue is a version of Nissan X-Trail and inspired by the Hi-Cross Concept to adapt to the US and Canada markets.<ref>{{cite news|title=All-New Nissan X-Trail SUV is Also the 2014 Rogue for North America|url=http://www.carscoops.com/2013/09/all-new-nissan-x-trail-suv-is-also-2014.html?m=1|accessdate=27 June 2016|publisher=carscoop|date=10 September 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812034320/http://www.carscoops.com/2013/09/all-new-nissan-x-trail-suv-is-also-2014.html?m=1|archivedate=12 August 2016}}</ref> Changes include optional third row 7 passenger seating, standard 4-wheel independent suspension, electric power-assisted steering, 4-wheel disc brakes with an anti-lock braking system. This generation has an interior size similar to Nissan's [[Nissan Murano|Murano]], [[Nissan Altima|Altima]], and [[Nissan Maxima|Maxima]]. For the 2018 model year Nissan decided to drop the third row option in favor of optimizing interior passenger room and cargo utility space.

===Safety===
The Rogue is currently holding the Top Safety Pick For [[IIHS]] Ratings. With the safety features from the first generation, it also includes lane departure warning, frontal collision warning, object detection warning (SL Trim Only), and a 360 degree backup camera.

2014&ndash;Present Model years (Not including Rogue Select)

Small Overlap Front Driver: Good

Small Overlap Front Passenger: Acceptable (2019 and newer)

Moderate Overlap Front Driver: Good

Side Impact: Good

Roof Strength: Good

The Small Overlap Test, introduced in 2012 by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety|IIHS]] simulates a frontal collision on 25% of the driver's side. Since its adoption, the IIHS has noticed several automakers making non-symmetrical modifications to their vehicles, the Rogue being one of them. Another Small Overlap Test was conducted on a number of vehicles including a 2014 Rogue, but was conducted on the passenger side instead. Based on this test, the Rogue would have received a \"Marginal\" rating if the IIHS were to provide ratings for passenger-side protection. The crash test's intrusion was 10 inches further into the vehicle on the passenger's side than on the driver's side and completely tore off the structural door hinge pillar on the passenger side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/vehicles-with-good-driver-side-protection-may-leave-passengers-at-risk|title=Passengers at risk in small overlap crashes|website=www.iihs.org|access-date=2016-09-04|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901003219/http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/vehicles-with-good-driver-side-protection-may-leave-passengers-at-risk|archivedate=2016-09-01}}</ref>

The Rogue was redesigned for the 2014 model year. The redesigned Rogue shares no ratings with the previous design, built since the 2008 model year and given a new name for 2014-15, the Rogue Select. Starting with the 2014 year, the Rogue was awarded Top Safety Pick+ by IIHS ([[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Nissan Rogue|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/nissan/rogue-4-door-suv/2014#jump-to|publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety|accessdate=22 August 2017|date=2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829093731/http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/nissan/rogue-4-door-suv/2014#jump-to|archivedate=29 August 2017}}</ref>

Nissan vehicles built 2014 to 2017 were put under a recall as the occupant classification sensor (OCS) would think that an adult in the passenger seat is a child. They recalled over 6 million vehicles for either reprogramming or replacing.

===2017 model year facelift===
The Rogue was facelifted for the 2017 model year, with restyled headlights and taillights, and [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] [[daytime running lights]] standard on all trim levels. The SL trim will also be available with full LED headlamps with HID as part of the SL Premium Package. The front grill plastics also changed, with the wider V-Motion Grille, that Nissan has throughout its lineup.

===2018 model year update===
Automatic Emergency Braking, Blind Spot Warning and Rear Cross Traffic Alert became standard safety features for MY 2018 both in US and Canadian markets.  [[Lane centering#Nissan ProPILOT|ProPILOT Assist]] is an option on the SL trim.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nissannews.com/en-US/nissan/usa/releases/nissan-propilot-assist-technology-makes-u-s-debut-on-2018-rogue-reduces-the-hassle-of-stop-and-go-highway-driving|title=Nissan ProPILOT Assist technology makes U.S. debut on 2018 Rogue – reduces the hassle of stop-and-go highway driving|work=Nissan Online Newsroom|access-date=2018-03-29|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116135313/http://nissannews.com/en-US/nissan/usa/releases/nissan-propilot-assist-technology-makes-u-s-debut-on-2018-rogue-reduces-the-hassle-of-stop-and-go-highway-driving|archivedate=2018-01-16}}</ref>

===Rogue Hybrid===
A [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] Rogue debuted January 2017, with limited availability for the 2017 model year. The hybrid features regenerative braking, pure drive hybrid emblems, energy monitor, hybrid battery status, under-floor storage area replacing Divide-N-Hide@ Cargo System, a 2.0 Liter 4 cylinder gasoline engine (power: 141&nbsp;hp and torque: 141&nbsp;lb-ft) and Xtronic CVT combined with an electric motor (power: 40&nbsp;hp) and Lithium-Ion battery, for a combined power of 176&nbsp;hp. The Lithium-Ion battery is located below the thick flooring of the under-floor cargo storage area. The Rogue Hybrid is available in two trim levels, SV and SL, but does not offer third-row seating (\"Family Package\") and Divide-N-Hide Cargo System due to the bulk of the [[Lithium-Ion battery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2017-nissan-rogue-rogue-hybrid-official-photos-and-info-anews,|title=2017 Nissan Rogue / Rogue Hybrid Official Photos and Info –Â News – Car and Driver|website=caranddriver.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504231904/https://www.caranddriver.com/news/2017-nissan-rogue-rogue-hybrid-official-photos-and-info-anews,|archivedate=4 May 2018}}</ref>

The Nissan Rogue made its debut at the [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]] on January 7, 2007. It replaces the [[Nissan X-Trail]] in [[Canada]] as Nissan's entry-level [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] and the [[body-on-frame]] [[Nissan Xterra]] in [[Mexico]] due to the Smyrna plant freeing capacity for the 2009 [[Suzuki Equator]], but the [[Nissan Xterra|Xterra]] continued on sale in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] through 2015 after being withdrawn from the Mexican market after the 2008 model year.

===Rogue Select===
The Select was a continuation of the first generation Rogue sold alongside an all-new Rogue that went on sale in 2013 as a 2014 model.  Since the production capacity allowed for the first generation to be built in conjunction with the 2nd generation, it allowed for a lower entry price to Rogue customers as well as fleet sales. It went on sale in January 2014 as a 2014 model year vehicle and was continued through 2015.  Nissan then announced that 2015 would be the final year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/09/28/nissan-to-sell-current-and-future-rogue-models-simultaneously/|title=Nissan's current Rogue renamed Rogue Select, will live alongside next gen|website=autoblog.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907181702/https://www.autoblog.com/2013/09/28/nissan-to-sell-current-and-future-rogue-models-simultaneously/|archivedate=7 September 2017}}</ref> The Rogue Select was not offered in Canada.

The second generation Rogue is a version of Nissan X-Trail and inspired by the Hi-Cross Concept to adapt to the US and Canada markets.<ref>{{cite news|title=All-New Nissan X-Trail SUV is Also the 2014 Rogue for North America|url=http://www.carscoops.com/2013/09/all-new-nissan-x-trail-suv-is-also-2014.html?m=1|accessdate=27 June 2016|publisher=carscoop|date=10 September 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812034320/http://www.carscoops.com/2013/09/all-new-nissan-x-trail-suv-is-also-2014.html?m=1|archivedate=12 August 2016}}</ref> Changes include optional third row 7 passenger seating, standard 4-wheel independent suspension, electric power-assisted steering, 4-wheel disc brakes with an anti-lock braking system. This generation has an interior size similar to Nissan's [[Nissan Murano|Murano]], [[Nissan Altima|Altima]], and [[Nissan Maxima|Maxima]]. For the 2018 model year Nissan decided to drop the third row option in favor of optimizing interior passenger room and cargo utility space.

===Safety===
The Rogue is currently holding the Top Safety Pick For [[IIHS]] Ratings. With the safety features from the first generation, it also includes lane departure warning, frontal collision warning, object detection warning (SL Trim Only), and a 360 degree backup camera.

2014&ndash;Present Model years (Not including Rogue Select)

Small Overlap Front Driver: Good

Small Overlap Front Passenger: Acceptable (2019 and newer)

Moderate Overlap Front Driver: Good

Side Impact: Good

Roof Strength: Good

The Small Overlap Test, introduced in 2012 by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety|IIHS]] simulates a frontal collision on 25% of the driver's side. Since its adoption, the IIHS has noticed several automakers making non-symmetrical modifications to their vehicles, the Rogue being one of them. Another Small Overlap Test was conducted on a number of vehicles including a 2014 Rogue, but was conducted on the passenger side instead. Based on this test, the Rogue would have received a \"Marginal\" rating if the IIHS were to provide ratings for passenger-side protection. The crash test's intrusion was 10 inches further into the vehicle on the passenger's side than on the driver's side and completely tore off the structural door hinge pillar on the passenger side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/vehicles-with-good-driver-side-protection-may-leave-passengers-at-risk|title=Passengers at risk in small overlap crashes|website=www.iihs.org|access-date=2016-09-04|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901003219/http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/vehicles-with-good-driver-side-protection-may-leave-passengers-at-risk|archivedate=2016-09-01}}</ref>

The Rogue was redesigned for the 2014 model year. The redesigned Rogue shares no ratings with the previous design, built since the 2008 model year and given a new name for 2014-15, the Rogue Select. Starting with the 2014 year, the Rogue was awarded Top Safety Pick+ by IIHS ([[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Nissan Rogue|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/nissan/rogue-4-door-suv/2014#jump-to|publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety|accessdate=22 August 2017|date=2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829093731/http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/nissan/rogue-4-door-suv/2014#jump-to|archivedate=29 August 2017}}</ref>

Nissan vehicles built 2014 to 2017 were put under a recall as the occupant classification sensor (OCS) would think that an adult in the passenger seat is a child. They recalled over 6 million vehicles for either reprogramming or replacing.

===2017 model year facelift===
The Rogue was facelifted for the 2017 model year, with restyled headlights and taillights, and [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] [[daytime running lights]] standard on all trim levels. The SL trim will also be available with full LED headlamps with HID as part of the SL Premium Package. The front grill plastics also changed, with the wider V-Motion Grille, that Nissan has throughout its lineup.

===2018 model year update===
Automatic Emergency Braking, Blind Spot Warning and Rear Cross Traffic Alert became standard safety features for MY 2018 both in US and Canadian markets.  [[Lane centering#Nissan ProPILOT|ProPILOT Assist]] is an option on the SL trim.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nissannews.com/en-US/nissan/usa/releases/nissan-propilot-assist-technology-makes-u-s-debut-on-2018-rogue-reduces-the-hassle-of-stop-and-go-highway-driving|title=Nissan ProPILOT Assist technology makes U.S. debut on 2018 Rogue – reduces the hassle of stop-and-go highway driving|work=Nissan Online Newsroom|access-date=2018-03-29|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116135313/http://nissannews.com/en-US/nissan/usa/releases/nissan-propilot-assist-technology-makes-u-s-debut-on-2018-rogue-reduces-the-hassle-of-stop-and-go-highway-driving|archivedate=2018-01-16}}</ref>

===Rogue Hybrid===
A [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] Rogue debuted January 2017, with limited availability for the 2017 model year. The hybrid features regenerative braking, pure drive hybrid emblems, energy monitor, hybrid battery status, under-floor storage area replacing Divide-N-Hide@ Cargo System, a 2.0 Liter 4 cylinder gasoline engine (power: 141&nbsp;hp and torque: 141&nbsp;lb-ft) and Xtronic CVT combined with an electric motor (power: 40&nbsp;hp) and Lithium-Ion battery, for a combined power of 176&nbsp;hp. The Lithium-Ion battery is located below the thick flooring of the under-floor cargo storage area. The Rogue Hybrid is available in two trim levels, SV and SL, but does not offer third-row seating (\"Family Package\") and Divide-N-Hide Cargo System due to the bulk of the [[Lithium-Ion battery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2017-nissan-rogue-rogue-hybrid-official-photos-and-info-anews,|title=2017 Nissan Rogue / Rogue Hybrid Official Photos and Info –Â News – Car and Driver|website=caranddriver.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504231904/https://www.caranddriver.com/news/2017-nissan-rogue-rogue-hybrid-official-photos-and-info-anews,|archivedate=4 May 2018}}</ref>

'''Island Records''' is a British-Jamaican [[record label]] owned by [[Universal Music Group]]. It was founded in 1959 by [[Chris Blackwell]], [[Graeme Goodall]], and [[Leslie Kong]] in [[Jamaica]],<ref name=\"May\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/island-the-record-label-that-changed-the-world-1676691.html|title=Island: The record label that changed the world|last=Perrone|first=Pierre |date=1 May 2009|work=The Independent |location=UK|accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref> and was eventually sold to [[PolyGram]] in 1989. Island and [[A&M Records]], another label recently acquired by PolyGram, were both at the time the largest [[independent record label]]s in history, with Island in particular having exerted a major influence on the progressive music scene in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s.

Island Records operates four international divisions: Island UK, Island US, Island Australia, and Island France (known as Vertigo France until 2014). Current key people include Island US president [[Darcus Beese]], [[OBE]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/island-records-president-darcus-beese-awarded-obe|title=Island Records President Darcus Beese Awarded OBE|last=|first=|website=The Voice|publisher=|date=17 November 2014|access-date=}}</ref> and MD Jon Turner. Partially due to its significant legacy, Island remains one of UMG's pre-eminent record labels.

Artists who have signed to Island Records include [[Ariana Grande]], [[Avicii]], [[Justin Bieber]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], [[Queen_(band)|Queen]], [[Poppy (entertainer)|Poppy,]] [[Cat Stevens]], [[Tove Lo]], [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[The Cranberries]], [[Tracy Bonham]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Bishop Briggs]], [[Hozier (musician)|Hozier]], [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], [[Demi Lovato]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[The Killers]], [[Loser (band)|Loser]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[U2]], [[Mumford & Sons]], [[Iggy Azalea]], [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Ben Howard]], [[James TW]], [[Florence + The Machine]], [[Sigrid (singer)|Sigrid]], [[John Newman (singer)|John Newman]], [[Local H]], [[Catfish and the Bottlemen]], [[Sandy Denny]], [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]], [[Big Shaq]], [[The Weeknd]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[JP Cooper]], [[PJ Harvey]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[John Martyn]], [[Nick Jonas]], [[KSI (entertainer)|KSI]], [[Robyn]], [[Shawn Mendes]], [[Jessie J]], [[scarlxrd]] and [[Laleh_(singer)|Laleh]].<ref name=\"Artists\">{{cite web|title=Artists {{!}} Island Records|url=http://www.islandrecords.co.uk/artists/|website=Island Records|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>

==History==

===Rise of the brand===
Island Records was founded in Jamaica on 4 July 1959 by [[Chris Blackwell]], [[Graeme Goodall]] and [[Leslie Kong]], and partially financed by Stanley Borden from [[RKO]]. Its name was inspired by the [[Harry Belafonte]] song \"[[Island in the Sun (Harry Belafonte song)|Island in the Sun]]\".<ref name=\"Full\">{{cite web|title=Keep on Running: 50 Years of Island Records (full documentary)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzFMa8BLGHk|work=YouTube|publisher=Google|accessdate=8 February 2014|author=reggae page|format=Video upload|date=10 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=Southall>{{cite book | last = Southall |first = Brian | title = The A-Z of Record Labels | publisher = Sanctuary Publishing | location = London | year = 2000 | isbn = 1-86074-281-5}}</ref> Blackwell explained in 2009: \"I loved music so much, I just wanted to get into it, or be as close to it as I could.\"<ref name=\"Full\" />

Tom Hayes, the label's sales manager between 1965 and 1967, referred to the early period of the label in the UK as \"organized chaos\". \"[[My Boy Lollipop]]\", sung by [[Millie Small]], was the label's first success in the UK and led to a world tour that also involved Blackwell. Blackwell explained in a 50-year-anniversary documentary that he was only interested in building long-term careers at that stage in time, rather than short-term projects.<ref name=\"Full\" /> [[Suzette Newman]] has been a close colleague of Chris Blackwell's since working together in the early days of Island Records, and while there she ran the Mango world music label.<ref>Pride, Dominic.

Blackwell relocated to England in May 1962 to garner greater levels of attention after the local Jamaican sound systems proved to be overwhelmingly successful. The vast majority of the artists who had signed to Blackwell's fledgling label while he was in Jamaica agreed to allow the musical entrepreneur to release their music in the UK. While in England, Blackwell travelled throughout the city carrying his stock with him and sold to record stores in the city. He did not provide any copies to radio stations, as they would not play any of the Island music; the music was also not reviewed by the press.<ref name=\"Full\" /> Meanwhile, Goodall left to start the [[Doctor Bird (label)|Doctor Bird]] record label in 1965.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11340584/Graeme-Goodall-obituary.html|title=Graeme Goodall - obituary|date=2015|access-date=2017-12-30|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

Blackwell signed the [[Spencer Davis Group]] to the label (at that time, many Island releases were being distributed by [[Philips Records|Philips]]/[[Fontana Records|Fontana]]). The group became very popular and Island started their own independent series to spotlight UK rock talent. They signed artists such as [[John Martyn]], [[Fairport Convention]], [[Free (band)|Free]], and greatly influenced the growing [[FM radio]] market. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, they were a major label in England with artists including [[Roxy Music]], [[King Crimson]], [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], [[Bob Marley and the Wailers|The Wailers]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[Steve Winwood]] and many others.  (In the US, many of their releases were issued on A&M prior to Island signing up an unsuccessful distribution deal with Capitol. After that failed, Island was largely an independently distributed label in the US.)

For [[Toots and the Maytals]], the group that introduced the term \"[[reggae]]\" in song with their 1968 single \"[[Do the Reggay]]\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/reggae |title=reggae |publisher=Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. |date=2016-11-30}}</ref> Chris Blackwell was the one who decided on the line-up of the group before introducing them to an international audience. Blackwell had signed [[Bob Marley]], and now Toots and the Maytals. In November 2016, Jackie Jackson described the formation of the group in a radio interview for Kool 97 FM Jamaica.<ref name=\":1\">[http://www.kool97fm.com T interview with Jackie Jackson, Paul Douglas, and Radcliffe \"Dougie\" Bryan]. Kool 97 FM.  27 November 2016. Retrieved 27 November 2016.</ref> Accompanied by [[Paul Douglas (musician)|Paul Douglas]] and Radcliffe \"Dougie\" Bryan in studio, Jackson explained:

<blockquote>We're all original members of Toots and the Maytals band. First it was Toots and the Maytals, three guys: [[Toots Hibbert|Toots]], Raleigh, and Jerry. ... And then they were signed to Island Records, Chris Blackwell. And we were their recording band. One day we were summoned to Chris' house. And he says, \"Alright gentleman, I think it's time. This Toots and the Maytals looks like it's going to be a big thing\". By this time he had already signed Bob (Marley). So in his camp, Island Records, there was Toots and the Maytals]/ the late Bob Marley; we were talking about reggae is going international now.  We kept on meeting and he (Blackwell) decided that the backing band that back all of the songs, the recording band, should be the Maytals band.  So everything came under Toots and the Maytals. So we became Maytals also. And then we hit the road in 1975 ... we were the opening act for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Jackson Browne]]. We were the opening act for [[The Who]] for about two weeks.<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>

The first Toots and the Maytals album released and distributed by Chris Blackwell's Island Records was ''[[Funky Kingston]].'' [[Toots and the Maytals|The Maytals]] had recently added a full-time backing band that included drummer [[Paul Douglas (musician)|Paul Douglas]] and bassist Jackie Jackson, and Chris Blackwell joined the group in the studio as a co-producer for the album.<ref>Thompson, Dave.

Retrieved 18 September 2016.</ref>

Despite the initial establishment work that Blackwell completed almost single-handedly, Island struggled as a business in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Bob Marley's 1981 death was detrimental to the company, especially after its having engineered Marley's international breakthrough only a few years earlier, while Irish rock band [[U2]], which had signed to Island in March 1980, was growing in popularity, but had not yet reached the international superstar status that was to come. In 1981, Blackwell also used the label to finance a new film production and distribution company, producing the film ''[[Countryman (film)|Countryman]]''.<ref name=IA>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|page=1|date=September 20, 1985|last=Greenberg|first=James|title=Island And Alive Dissolving Joint Prod'n Venture}}</ref> In 1982, [[Paul Morley]] and producer [[Trevor Horn]] started the [[ZTT]] label under the Island banner and Blackwell was known to approve excessive spending by the label.<ref name=\"May\" /> Morley recalls in a 2009 book about Island Records:

<blockquote>I eventually grew to appreciate how Chris Blackwell, and therefore Island Records, was not about one thing, or one style, or one system, or one way of doing things ... [I began] reflecting how the world functions and reinvents itself precisely because it is a fluid, sometimes dangerous, always exhilarating union of systems and beliefs and the best way of allowing the world to progress is to mix up and place in glorious conflict these various systems and beliefs.<ref name=\"Cool\" /></blockquote>

In 1983, the film production company formed a partnership with [[Shep Gordon]]'s Alive Enterprises to form Island Alive and had success with ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (film)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'', ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'', and ''[[Stop Making Sense]]''.<ref name=IA/> The partnership was dissolved in 1985.<ref name=IA/> In August 1987, the company was not able to pay a US$5 million sum that it owed to U2 in royalties for ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' album, as it had diverted the funds to finance several unsuccessful films. U2 responded by negotiating a deal whereby they invested the unpaid royalties into the company in exchange for a stake in the company that was estimated to be around 10 per cent.<ref>{{Cite book | last = McGee | first = Matt | title = U2:A Diary | publisher = Omnibus Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-84772-108-2}}</ref>

The label's [[4th & Broadway]] division, operating since the mid-1980s, achieved some success marketing alternative [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and dance-pop music with artists such as [[Eric B. & Rakim|Eric B. and Rakim]] and the [[Stereo MCs]]. Mango ([[Chaka Demus & Pliers|Chaka Demus and Pliers]]) was another Island dance-oriented subsidiary, while it was singer [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]] who achieved worldwide success with the rock song \"[[Addicted to Love (song)|Addicted to Love]]\" in 1986. African musicians such as [[King Sunny Adé]] and [[Angélique Kidjo]] were also championed by Blackwell.<ref name=\"May\" />

===PolyGram acquisition===
In July 1989, Blackwell sold Island Records and Island Music to the PolyGram UK Group for [[Pound sterling|£]]180 million ([[United States dollar|US$]]300 million)—he explained in 2009: \"It had gotten too big and too corporate for me and I couldn't really handle it.\"<ref name=\"Cool\">{{cite news|title=A history of cool|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/30/books-music-island-records|accessdate=8 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 May 2009|author=David Sinclair}}</ref> Following the sale, Island was no longer an independent company, but Blackwell was given a position on PolyGram's board and stayed on as CEO of PolyGram's new Island Entertainment division for ten years.<ref name=\"Mike\">{{cite web|title=HOT SEAT: MIKE TAYLOR – ISLAND RECORDS|url=http://www.themusicnetwork.com/hot-seat-mike-taylor-island-records/|work=The Music Network|publisher=The Music Network|accessdate=8 February 2014|first =Lars | last=Brandle|date=8 February 2013}}</ref> PolyGram immediately began reissuing much of the Island back catalogue on compact disc and expanded Island's reach through its global manufacturing and distribution network, but the label was relatively unfocused in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Blackwell eventually ended his association with the company in 1997, as the corporate life hindered the independent ethos of his personal life. \"I never really had a job until I sold Island to PolyGram in 1989. It had gotten too corporate,\" he commented afterwards. After Blackwell left, PolyGram closed Island's film business.<ref>{{Cite web| last1 = Madigan| first1 = Nick| last2 = Madigan| first2 = Nick| title = Polygram shutters Island Pictures| work = Variety| accessdate = 2019-02-09| date = 1997-12-09| url = https://variety.com/1997/film/news/polygram-shutters-island-pictures-111747549/}}</ref> Blackwell left to found the [[Palm Pictures]] company and run a chain of boutique hotels in Miami, US and the Caribbean, including the very exclusive Goldeneye estate, once the Jamaican home of [[James Bond]] creator [[Ian Fleming]].<ref name=\"Full\" /> Then in May 1998, all of PolyGram and its associated labels were purchased by [[Seagram]] which announced its plan to integrate PolyGram with UMG to produce an estimated cost savings, within a couple of years, of between US$275 million and $300 million annually. Seagram further explained that the acquisition would unite a significant international presence with a thriving domestic business, as more than three-quarters of PolyGram's sales were outside the US.<ref>{{cite news|title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; $10.6 Billion Seagram Deal For Polygram|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/22/business/international-business-10.6-billion-seagram-deal-for-polygram.html|accessdate=8 February 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 May 1998|author=Geraldine Fabrikant}}</ref>

===Under Universal Music Group===
In December 1998 and the first three months of 1999, UMG placed three divisions under the management of the Island brand: one in the UK, one in the US, and one in Germany.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In each territory, these companies were merged under umbrella groups:

*In the UK, Island Records Group, now operating under [[Virgin EMI Records]] since 2013.
*In the US, Island, [[Mercury Records|Mercury]], and [[Def Jam]] and 14 other record labels were merged into [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]]; however, within the year, Island/Mercury decided to build upon the success of [[Def Jam Recordings]] and re-incorporated the label as The Island Def Jam Music Group. On April 1, 2014, Universal Music announced the disbandment of IDJMG, one of four operational umbrella groups within Universal Music. Effective as of the same day of the announcement, Island Records and [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] will now operate as autonomous record labels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/record-labels/6039546/how-universal-music-groups-new-top-level-troika-brings-peace |title=How Universal Music Group's New Top-Level Troika Brings Peace (For Now) |publisher=billboard.com |accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref>
*In Germany, Island and Mercury merged to become divisions of the Island Mercury Label group.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

<blockquote>I came to work with them, sort of fully formed—the way that I looked, the way that I sounded: that was already there. And I felt, like, that they just supported where that was going to go.<ref name=\"Full\" /></blockquote>

The label celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009.

===Island 50===
In 2009, Island Records marked the 50th anniversary of its foundation in [[Jamaica]] by Chris Blackwell with a series of live concerts and an exhibition under the Island 50 banner. The events were a celebration of the street-cool, independent outlook and striking visual imagery at the label's creative core. These festivities centred around a week-long run of shows at Shepherd's Bush Empire and [[Bush Hall]] in London. The concerts featured performances tracing the label's history from its reggae and jazz roots to the modern era. Among the artists who appeared were [[Sly & Robbie]], [[Ernest Ranglin]], [[Paul Weller]], The Compass Point All Stars, [[The I Threes]], [[Aswad]], [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts|Kid Creole & the Coconuts]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Tom Tom Club]], [[Toots & The Maytals]], [[The Mighty Diamonds]], Yusuf Islam/ [[Cat Stevens]], [[Bombay Bicycle Club]], [[Baaba Maal]] and [[U2]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/andrew-perry/5393263/Island-Records-50th-anniversary-concert-Grace-Jones-Sly-and-Robbie-and-other-guests-review.html|title=Island Records' 50th anniversary concert: Grace Jones, Sly & Robbie and other guests - review|last=Perry|first=Andrew|date=2009-05-27|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Another Island 50 tribute event was held over four nights at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, with [[Marianne Faithfull]], Grace Jones and Sly & Robbie all appearing, and Chris Blackwell holding a Question & Answer session.

There was also a major exhibition at the [[The Vinyl Factory|Vinyl Factory]] Gallery in Soho, held in an open space beneath the record shop Phonica. The exhibition featured a display of treasured musical artifacts, including the [[Trabant]] car from the sleeve of [[U2]]'s ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', [[Nick Drake]]'s guitar, the dress worn by [[Amy Winehouse]] at the 2008 Grammy Awards, the handwritten lyric sheet for Winehouse's song \"[[Love Is a Losing Game]]\" and Bob Marley's passport application form. The exhibition contained 800 prints showcasing the work for Island of the photographers Adrian Boot, [[Jean-Paul Goude]], [[Anton Corbijn]], [[Gered Mankowitz]], [[Keith Morris (photographer)|Keith Morris]] and Brian Cooke, and the London exhibition also featured live performances at the Vinyl Factory Gallery by [[DJ Shadow]] and [[PJ Harvey]].

===Into Island's sixth decade: 2009–2017===
Following its 50th anniversary in 2009, Island Records entered its sixth decade on a tide of optimism. The years that followed saw fresh success for a number of established acts, including [[PJ Harvey]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Paul Weller]] and [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] and an exciting wave of new signings. In its largest live production since its 2009 anniversary, the label also staged a concert by [[The Weeknd]] and [[Jack Garratt]] on [[Osea Island]], a small island in [[Essex]], as part of a bespoke one-day festival for 400 guests, including label staff, media and 200 fans who obtained tickets via a ballot.

2016 proved a particularly successful year for the label in the UK: over a seven-week period between April and June, four separate Island acts spent at least one week at number one. The albums concerned were [[PJ Harvey]]'s ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]'', [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]]'s ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' (which spent two weeks at number one), [[Ariana Grande]]'s ''[[Dangerous Woman]]'' and [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen's]] ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]''.

====Island's sixth decade: the artists====
[[PJ Harvey]]'s eighth studio album, 2011's ''[[Let England Shake]]'', was one of the key records of Island's sixth decade. Made in a cliff-top church in [[Dorset]], it won the 2011 [[Mercury Music Prize]], making Harvey the only artist to land the prestigious award twice (she had prevailed ten years previously with ''[[Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea]]''). [[Mumford & Sons]], who grew out of a series of jam sessions in London in 2007, signed a licensing deal with Island in 2009. Heralded as standard bearers for a vibrant new wave of folkish, countrified rock, their debut album, ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford & Sons album)|Sigh No More]]'', sold two million, reaching number two in Britain and America. It also won best British album at the [[BRIT Awards]] in February 2011. The follow-up, ''[[Babel (Mumford & Sons album)|Babel]]'', did even better in 2012, becoming the UK's fastest-selling album of that year, going to number one in Britain and the US and winning album of the year at the 2013 [[Grammy Awards]]. Island also secured the signing of [[Florence + The Machine]] after songwriter [[Florence Welch]] dropped out of her local art college in [[Camberwell]], South London. Her 2009 debut album, ''[[Lungs (album)|Lungs]]'', sold four million and spent over 12 months in the UK chart before being crowned British album of the year at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2010. ''Lungs'' was followed by 2011's theatrical ''[[Ceremonials]]'', and 2015's more introspective ''[[How Big How Blue How Beautiful]]''.

[[Keane (band)|Keane]] were another of the big successes of Island's sixth decade. Having topped the charts with their five million-selling debut album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'' in 2004, they went on to secure five consecutive number-one albums in the UK (a feat bettered only by [[The Beatles]]), with subsequent releases ''[[Under the Iron Sea]]'' (2006), ''[[Perfect Symmetry (Keane album)|Perfect Symmetry]]'' (2008), ''[[Night Train (EP)|Night Train]]'' (2010) and ''[[Strangeland (album)|Strangeland]]'' (2012) all topping the charts. [[Paul Weller]]'s relationship with Island dates back to his fourth solo album, 1997's ''[[Heavy Soul (Paul Weller album)|Heavy Soul]]'', and its 2000 follow-up [[Heliocentric (Paul Weller album)|Heliocentric]]. He returned to the label in 2008 and began an outstanding trilogy of releases that contained some of his strongest solo work ''[[22 Dreams]]'' (2008), the [[Mercury Music Prize]]-nominated ''[[Wake Up The Nation]]'' (2010) and ''[[Sonik Kicks]]'' (2012).

North London quartet [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] also released four albums on Island, with each one signalling a change of direction: the indie-rock of 2009's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose (2008-09)|I Had The Blues But I Shook Them Loose]]'' paved the way for 2010's folkier ''[[Flaws (album)|Flaws]]'', the modern rock of 2011's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#A Different Kind of Fix (2011-12)|A Different Kind Of Fix]]'' and the broad-based invention of 2014's ''[[So Long, See You Tomorrow (album)|So Long, See You Tomorrow]]''. Having built a loyal live following, [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen]] signed to Island in 2014. After reaching platinum sales status in the UK with their Top Ten debut album, ''[[The Balcony (album)|The Balcony]]'', the Welsh rock band won the BBC Introducing Award at the first [[BBC Music Awards]] in 2014 and were crowned British Breakthrough Act at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2016 (an award voted for by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] listeners). Their second album, 2016's ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]'', was a UK number one.

Island was also responsible for securing major British breakthroughs for two of the 21st century's biggest international superstars in [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[The Weeknd]]. The success of Toronto hip-hop artist Drake came after the label had worked patiently to build his profile over a number of years, culminating in the success of his fourth album ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' and its attendant singles in 2016. \"[[One Dance]]\", Drake's first number one single in the UK, had 1.95 million sales<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-40-biggest-songs-of-2016__17517/ |title=The Official Top 40 Biggest Songs of 2016 |date=2016-12-30 |publisher=The Official UK Charts Company |accessdate=2017-03-19}}</ref> to become Britain's biggest-selling single of 2016. The single's 15-week run at number one equalled the mark for the second longest in UK chart history. With the Island-signed [[Mike Posner]] having held the number one spot with \"[[I Took a Pill in Ibiza]]\" for four consecutive weeks before being replaced by \"One Dance\", Island held the top spot in the UK singles chart for 19 consecutive weeks between March and August 2016. To crown a record-breaking year, Drake was named the world's best-selling recording artist of 2016 by international music industry organisation [[IFPI]] in February 2017.

Canadian singer and songwriter [[The Weeknd]] also cemented his position as one of the world's leading recording artists, with the 2016 success of his third album ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]''. Its success was the culmination of a strategy that had seen Island build his UK profile over a four-year period that dated from his 2013 studio album ''[[Kiss Land]]''. Island's commitment to further nurturing the careers of global superstars was reiterated in June 2016 with the signing of [[Sean Paul]]. The Jamaican singer, rapper and songwriter released \"[[No Lie (Sean Paul song)|No Lie]]\", his first single for Island, in November 2016.

Signed to Island via a licensing deal with independent label PMR, [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]] were formed by two brothers from [[Reigate]] in [[Surrey]], Guy and Howard Lawrence. The duo discovered the joys of nineties [[House music|house]], [[techno]] and [[two-step garage]] while studying music production at college, and went on to enjoy success with their two Island albums ''[[Settle (album)|Settle]]'' (2013) and ''[[Caracal (album)|Caracal]]'' (2015), making extensive use of an array of guest vocalists including [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], [[Jamie Woon]], [[Eliza Doolittle]], [[Lorde]] and [[Gregory Porter]]. One of the acts who guested on ''Settle'' was [[AlunaGeorge]], a boy-girl duo from London (singer Aluna Francis and musician and producer George Reid), who released their debut album, ''Body Music'', on Island in 2013. Like Disclosure, [[Jessie Ware]] signed to Island through a link with independent label [[PMR Records|PMR]]. A soulful singer-songwriter from Brixton, Ware was nominated for the 2012 [[Mercury Music Prize]] with her smooth debut album, [[Devotion (Jessie Ware album)|Devotion]], and enjoyed further success with 2014's [[Tough Love (Jessie Ware album)|Tough Love]]. Another Island act to enjoy a significant breakthrough was Yorkshire singer [[John Newman (singer)|John Newman]], who topped the UK charts with his first solo single, \"[[Love Me Again (song)|Love Me Again]]\", and his debut album [[Tribute (John Newman album)|Tribute]].

In May 2018, incumbent president [[David Massey (music executive)|David Massey]] left Island to join [[Sony Music Entertainment]]'s relaunch of [[Arista Records]]. [[Darcus Beese]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] took on the role of president upon Massey's departure. To make the transition, Beese relocated from the United Kingdom to Island's offices at [[Universal Music Group]]'s New York City building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universalmusic.com/darcus-beese-named-president-island-records/|title=DARCUS BEESE NAMED PRESIDENT OF ISLAND RECORDS|date=2018-05-24|website=UMG|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>

==Manga Entertainment==
Island World Communications, under the leadership of Blackwell and Andy Frain, created [[Manga Entertainment]] Ltd, the anime and live action Japanese film division of Island in 1991. In that year, Laurence Guinness, the Senior VP at Island World Communications bought the distribution license for ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' from ICA Projects in London,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.5/articles/segall1.5.html|title=Manga Entertainment: Taking Anime To The Next Stage|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref> and the distribution of what was the label's first release is considered a crucial milestone in the establishment of anime in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manga Entertainment's 20th Anniversary Party - Page 1|url=http://www.uk-anime.net/articles/Manga_Entertainment's_20th_Anniversary_Party/1|work=UK Anime Network|publisher=Etharius Ltd|accessdate=8 February 2014|author=Robert Frazer|date=June 2011}}</ref> In 1994, Island sold the distribution licenses for most of Manga's releases to Siren Entertainment, an independent entertainment company in Australia. Those rights were then given to Madman Entertainment in 1999 when Siren became solely an acquisitions company.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Artists and recordings==
The recording roster of Island Records, both past and present, has been and continues to be diverse. The label continues to champion new music, a practice that was highlighted at the Island Records 50th anniversary event, at which new artists provided the entertainment.<ref name=\"Fifty\">{{cite web|title=Island Records' 50th Birthday Party - The Constitution,|url=http://www.dailymusicguide.com/Reviews/island-records-50th-birthday-party-the-constitution-27042009-2305.aspx|work=Daily Music Guide|publisher=Daily Music Guide|accessdate=9 February 2014|author=Laura Bruneau|date=27 April 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221093507/http://www.dailymusicguide.com/Reviews/island-records-50th-birthday-party-the-constitution-27042009-2305.aspx|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

'''Island Records''' is a British-Jamaican [[record label]] owned by [[Universal Music Group]]. It was founded in 1959 by [[Chris Blackwell]], [[Graeme Goodall]], and [[Leslie Kong]] in [[Jamaica]],<ref name=\"May\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/island-the-record-label-that-changed-the-world-1676691.html|title=Island: The record label that changed the world|last=Perrone|first=Pierre |date=1 May 2009|work=The Independent |location=UK|accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref> and was eventually sold to [[PolyGram]] in 1989. Island and [[A&M Records]], another label recently acquired by PolyGram, were both at the time the largest [[independent record label]]s in history, with Island in particular having exerted a major influence on the progressive music scene in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s.

Island Records operates four international divisions: Island UK, Island US, Island Australia, and Island France (known as Vertigo France until 2014). Current key people include Island US president [[Darcus Beese]], [[OBE]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/island-records-president-darcus-beese-awarded-obe|title=Island Records President Darcus Beese Awarded OBE|last=|first=|website=The Voice|publisher=|date=17 November 2014|access-date=}}</ref> and MD Jon Turner. Partially due to its significant legacy, Island remains one of UMG's pre-eminent record labels.

==History==

===Rise of the brand===
Island Records was founded in Jamaica on 4 July 1959 by [[Chris Blackwell]], [[Graeme Goodall]] and [[Leslie Kong]], and partially financed by Stanley Borden from [[RKO]]. Its name was inspired by the [[Harry Belafonte]] song \"[[Island in the Sun (Harry Belafonte song)|Island in the Sun]]\".<ref name=\"Full\">{{cite web|title=Keep on Running: 50 Years of Island Records (full documentary)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzFMa8BLGHk|work=YouTube|publisher=Google|accessdate=8 February 2014|author=reggae page|format=Video upload|date=10 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=Southall>{{cite book | last = Southall |first = Brian | title = The A-Z of Record Labels | publisher = Sanctuary Publishing | location = London | year = 2000 | isbn = 1-86074-281-5}}</ref> Blackwell explained in 2009: \"I loved music so much, I just wanted to get into it, or be as close to it as I could.\"<ref name=\"Full\" />

Tom Hayes, the label's sales manager between 1965 and 1967, referred to the early period of the label in the UK as \"organized chaos\". \"[[My Boy Lollipop]]\", sung by [[Millie Small]], was the label's first success in the UK and led to a world tour that also involved Blackwell. Blackwell explained in a 50-year-anniversary documentary that he was only interested in building long-term careers at that stage in time, rather than short-term projects.<ref name=\"Full\" /> [[Suzette Newman]] has been a close colleague of Chris Blackwell's since working together in the early days of Island Records, and while there she ran the Mango world music label.<ref>Pride, Dominic.

''Billboard magazine''. Published by Nielsen Business Media, Inc. 31 October 1998, p. 8. Retrieved 17 December 2016.</ref> Suzette Newman and Chris Salewicz were the editors for the book ''The Story of Island Records: [[Keep On Running]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Newman, Suzette and Chris Salewicz. |title=The Story of Island Records: Keep on Running |publisher=Universe Publishing |year=2010 |accessdate=2016-12-17 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Story_of_Island_Records.html?id=rBImQwAACAAJ}}</ref>

Blackwell relocated to England in May 1962 to garner greater levels of attention after the local Jamaican sound systems proved to be overwhelmingly successful. The vast majority of the artists who had signed to Blackwell's fledgling label while he was in Jamaica agreed to allow the musical entrepreneur to release their music in the UK. While in England, Blackwell travelled throughout the city carrying his stock with him and sold to record stores in the city. He did not provide any copies to radio stations, as they would not play any of the Island music; the music was also not reviewed by the press.<ref name=\"Full\" /> Meanwhile, Goodall left to start the [[Doctor Bird (label)|Doctor Bird]] record label in 1965.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11340584/Graeme-Goodall-obituary.html|title=Graeme Goodall - obituary|date=2015|access-date=2017-12-30|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

Blackwell signed the [[Spencer Davis Group]] to the label (at that time, many Island releases were being distributed by [[Philips Records|Philips]]/[[Fontana Records|Fontana]]). The group became very popular and Island started their own independent series to spotlight UK rock talent. They signed artists such as [[John Martyn]], [[Fairport Convention]], [[Free (band)|Free]], and greatly influenced the growing [[FM radio]] market. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, they were a major label in England with artists including [[Roxy Music]], [[King Crimson]], [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], [[Bob Marley and the Wailers|The Wailers]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[Steve Winwood]] and many others.  (In the US, many of their releases were issued on A&M prior to Island signing up an unsuccessful distribution deal with Capitol. After that failed, Island was largely an independently distributed label in the US.)

For [[Toots and the Maytals]], the group that introduced the term \"[[reggae]]\" in song with their 1968 single \"[[Do the Reggay]]\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/reggae |title=reggae |publisher=Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. |date=2016-11-30}}</ref> Chris Blackwell was the one who decided on the line-up of the group before introducing them to an international audience. Blackwell had signed [[Bob Marley]], and now Toots and the Maytals. In November 2016, Jackie Jackson described the formation of the group in a radio interview for Kool 97 FM Jamaica.<ref name=\":1\">[http://www.kool97fm.com T interview with Jackie Jackson, Paul Douglas, and Radcliffe \"Dougie\" Bryan]. Kool 97 FM.  27 November 2016. Retrieved 27 November 2016.</ref> Accompanied by [[Paul Douglas (musician)|Paul Douglas]] and Radcliffe \"Dougie\" Bryan in studio, Jackson explained:

<blockquote>We're all original members of Toots and the Maytals band. First it was Toots and the Maytals, three guys: [[Toots Hibbert|Toots]], Raleigh, and Jerry. ... And then they were signed to Island Records, Chris Blackwell. And we were their recording band. One day we were summoned to Chris' house. And he says, \"Alright gentleman, I think it's time. This Toots and the Maytals looks like it's going to be a big thing\". By this time he had already signed Bob (Marley). So in his camp, Island Records, there was Toots and the Maytals]/ the late Bob Marley; we were talking about reggae is going international now.  We kept on meeting and he (Blackwell) decided that the backing band that back all of the songs, the recording band, should be the Maytals band.  So everything came under Toots and the Maytals. So we became Maytals also. And then we hit the road in 1975 ... we were the opening act for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Jackson Browne]]. We were the opening act for [[The Who]] for about two weeks.<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>

The first Toots and the Maytals album released and distributed by Chris Blackwell's Island Records was ''[[Funky Kingston]].'' [[Toots and the Maytals|The Maytals]] had recently added a full-time backing band that included drummer [[Paul Douglas (musician)|Paul Douglas]] and bassist Jackie Jackson, and Chris Blackwell joined the group in the studio as a co-producer for the album.<ref>Thompson, Dave.

Despite the initial establishment work that Blackwell completed almost single-handedly, Island struggled as a business in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Bob Marley's 1981 death was detrimental to the company, especially after its having engineered Marley's international breakthrough only a few years earlier, while Irish rock band [[U2]], which had signed to Island in March 1980, was growing in popularity, but had not yet reached the international superstar status that was to come. In 1981, Blackwell also used the label to finance a new film production and distribution company, producing the film ''[[Countryman (film)|Countryman]]''.<ref name=IA>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|page=1|date=September 20, 1985|last=Greenberg|first=James|title=Island And Alive Dissolving Joint Prod'n Venture}}</ref> In 1982, [[Paul Morley]] and producer [[Trevor Horn]] started the [[ZTT]] label under the Island banner and Blackwell was known to approve excessive spending by the label.<ref name=\"May\" /> Morley recalls in a 2009 book about Island Records:

<blockquote>I eventually grew to appreciate how Chris Blackwell, and therefore Island Records, was not about one thing, or one style, or one system, or one way of doing things ... [I began] reflecting how the world functions and reinvents itself precisely because it is a fluid, sometimes dangerous, always exhilarating union of systems and beliefs and the best way of allowing the world to progress is to mix up and place in glorious conflict these various systems and beliefs.<ref name=\"Cool\" /></blockquote>

In 1983, the film production company formed a partnership with [[Shep Gordon]]'s Alive Enterprises to form Island Alive and had success with ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (film)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'', ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'', and ''[[Stop Making Sense]]''.<ref name=IA/> The partnership was dissolved in 1985.<ref name=IA/> In August 1987, the company was not able to pay a US$5 million sum that it owed to U2 in royalties for ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' album, as it had diverted the funds to finance several unsuccessful films. U2 responded by negotiating a deal whereby they invested the unpaid royalties into the company in exchange for a stake in the company that was estimated to be around 10 per cent.<ref>{{Cite book | last = McGee | first = Matt | title = U2:A Diary | publisher = Omnibus Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-84772-108-2}}</ref>

The label's [[4th & Broadway]] division, operating since the mid-1980s, achieved some success marketing alternative [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and dance-pop music with artists such as [[Eric B. & Rakim|Eric B. and Rakim]] and the [[Stereo MCs]]. Mango ([[Chaka Demus & Pliers|Chaka Demus and Pliers]]) was another Island dance-oriented subsidiary, while it was singer [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]] who achieved worldwide success with the rock song \"[[Addicted to Love (song)|Addicted to Love]]\" in 1986. African musicians such as [[King Sunny Adé]] and [[Angélique Kidjo]] were also championed by Blackwell.<ref name=\"May\" />

===PolyGram acquisition===
In July 1989, Blackwell sold Island Records and Island Music to the PolyGram UK Group for [[Pound sterling|£]]180 million ([[United States dollar|US$]]300 million)—he explained in 2009: \"It had gotten too big and too corporate for me and I couldn't really handle it.\"<ref name=\"Cool\">{{cite news|title=A history of cool|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/30/books-music-island-records|accessdate=8 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 May 2009|author=David Sinclair}}</ref> Following the sale, Island was no longer an independent company, but Blackwell was given a position on PolyGram's board and stayed on as CEO of PolyGram's new Island Entertainment division for ten years.<ref name=\"Mike\">{{cite web|title=HOT SEAT: MIKE TAYLOR – ISLAND RECORDS|url=http://www.themusicnetwork.com/hot-seat-mike-taylor-island-records/|work=The Music Network|publisher=The Music Network|accessdate=8 February 2014|first =Lars | last=Brandle|date=8 February 2013}}</ref> PolyGram immediately began reissuing much of the Island back catalogue on compact disc and expanded Island's reach through its global manufacturing and distribution network, but the label was relatively unfocused in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Blackwell eventually ended his association with the company in 1997, as the corporate life hindered the independent ethos of his personal life. \"I never really had a job until I sold Island to PolyGram in 1989. It had gotten too corporate,\" he commented afterwards. After Blackwell left, PolyGram closed Island's film business.<ref>{{Cite web| last1 = Madigan| first1 = Nick| last2 = Madigan| first2 = Nick| title = Polygram shutters Island Pictures| work = Variety| accessdate = 2019-02-09| date = 1997-12-09| url = https://variety.com/1997/film/news/polygram-shutters-island-pictures-111747549/}}</ref> Blackwell left to found the [[Palm Pictures]] company and run a chain of boutique hotels in Miami, US and the Caribbean, including the very exclusive Goldeneye estate, once the Jamaican home of [[James Bond]] creator [[Ian Fleming]].<ref name=\"Full\" /> Then in May 1998, all of PolyGram and its associated labels were purchased by [[Seagram]] which announced its plan to integrate PolyGram with UMG to produce an estimated cost savings, within a couple of years, of between US$275 million and $300 million annually. Seagram further explained that the acquisition would unite a significant international presence with a thriving domestic business, as more than three-quarters of PolyGram's sales were outside the US.<ref>{{cite news|title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; $10.6 Billion Seagram Deal For Polygram|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/22/business/international-business-10.6-billion-seagram-deal-for-polygram.html|accessdate=8 February 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 May 1998|author=Geraldine Fabrikant}}</ref>

===Under Universal Music Group===
In December 1998 and the first three months of 1999, UMG placed three divisions under the management of the Island brand: one in the UK, one in the US, and one in Germany.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In each territory, these companies were merged under umbrella groups:

*In the UK, Island Records Group, now operating under [[Virgin EMI Records]] since 2013.
*In the US, Island, [[Mercury Records|Mercury]], and [[Def Jam]] and 14 other record labels were merged into [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]]; however, within the year, Island/Mercury decided to build upon the success of [[Def Jam Recordings]] and re-incorporated the label as The Island Def Jam Music Group. On April 1, 2014, Universal Music announced the disbandment of IDJMG, one of four operational umbrella groups within Universal Music. Effective as of the same day of the announcement, Island Records and [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] will now operate as autonomous record labels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/record-labels/6039546/how-universal-music-groups-new-top-level-troika-brings-peace |title=How Universal Music Group's New Top-Level Troika Brings Peace (For Now) |publisher=billboard.com |accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref>
*In Germany, Island and Mercury merged to become divisions of the Island Mercury Label group.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

However, in 2001, UMG was merged with French company [[Vivendi SA|Vivendi S.A.]] to create Vivendi Universal S.A.; but the music company remains under the name Universal Music Group (UMG).<ref name=\"HullHutchison2011\">{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey P.

In the US, Island became a predominantly pop/rock label, as their urban artists were assigned to either Def Jam or Def Soul, a new Island/Def Jam [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] imprint.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Following the takeover of Island by UMG, flagship band U2 were dissatisfied after chief [[Jason Iley]] moved to the Mercury label in the mid-2000s and signed with Mercury for the UK and [[Interscope Records]] for the US.<ref name=\"Jem\">{{cite web|title=U2 Return to 'Spiritual Home' Island Records for Next LP, Expected in April|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/12/u2-new-album-spiritual-home-island-records/|work=Spin|publisher=BUZZMEDIA|accessdate=8 February 2014|first=Jem |last=Aswad|date=30 December 2013}}</ref> However, successful artists such as [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] and [[PJ Harvey]] were impressed by the label and signed on as artists. Tricky explained: \"I knew I could get freedom. I knew I could do what I wanted to do.\",<ref name=\"Full\" /> while Harvey later stated:

<blockquote>I came to work with them, sort of fully formed—the way that I looked, the way that I sounded: that was already there. And I felt, like, that they just supported where that was going to go.<ref name=\"Full\" /></blockquote>

The label celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009.

===Island 50===
In 2009, Island Records marked the 50th anniversary of its foundation in [[Jamaica]] by Chris Blackwell with a series of live concerts and an exhibition under the Island 50 banner. The events were a celebration of the street-cool, independent outlook and striking visual imagery at the label's creative core. These festivities centred around a week-long run of shows at Shepherd's Bush Empire and [[Bush Hall]] in London. The concerts featured performances tracing the label's history from its reggae and jazz roots to the modern era. Among the artists who appeared were [[Sly & Robbie]], [[Ernest Ranglin]], [[Paul Weller]], The Compass Point All Stars, [[The I Threes]], [[Aswad]], [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts|Kid Creole & the Coconuts]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Tom Tom Club]], [[Toots & The Maytals]], [[The Mighty Diamonds]], Yusuf Islam/ [[Cat Stevens]], [[Bombay Bicycle Club]], [[Baaba Maal]] and [[U2]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/andrew-perry/5393263/Island-Records-50th-anniversary-concert-Grace-Jones-Sly-and-Robbie-and-other-guests-review.html|title=Island Records' 50th anniversary concert: Grace Jones, Sly & Robbie and other guests - review|last=Perry|first=Andrew|date=2009-05-27|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Another Island 50 tribute event was held over four nights at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, with [[Marianne Faithfull]], Grace Jones and Sly & Robbie all appearing, and Chris Blackwell holding a Question & Answer session.

There was also a major exhibition at the [[The Vinyl Factory|Vinyl Factory]] Gallery in Soho, held in an open space beneath the record shop Phonica. The exhibition featured a display of treasured musical artifacts, including the [[Trabant]] car from the sleeve of [[U2]]'s ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', [[Nick Drake]]'s guitar, the dress worn by [[Amy Winehouse]] at the 2008 Grammy Awards, the handwritten lyric sheet for Winehouse's song \"[[Love Is a Losing Game]]\" and Bob Marley's passport application form. The exhibition contained 800 prints showcasing the work for Island of the photographers Adrian Boot, [[Jean-Paul Goude]], [[Anton Corbijn]], [[Gered Mankowitz]], [[Keith Morris (photographer)|Keith Morris]] and Brian Cooke, and the London exhibition also featured live performances at the Vinyl Factory Gallery by [[DJ Shadow]] and [[PJ Harvey]].

===Into Island's sixth decade: 2009–2017===
Following its 50th anniversary in 2009, Island Records entered its sixth decade on a tide of optimism. The years that followed saw fresh success for a number of established acts, including [[PJ Harvey]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Paul Weller]] and [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] and an exciting wave of new signings. In its largest live production since its 2009 anniversary, the label also staged a concert by [[The Weeknd]] and [[Jack Garratt]] on [[Osea Island]], a small island in [[Essex]], as part of a bespoke one-day festival for 400 guests, including label staff, media and 200 fans who obtained tickets via a ballot.

2016 proved a particularly successful year for the label in the UK: over a seven-week period between April and June, four separate Island acts spent at least one week at number one. The albums concerned were [[PJ Harvey]]'s ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]'', [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]]'s ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' (which spent two weeks at number one), [[Ariana Grande]]'s ''[[Dangerous Woman]]'' and [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen's]] ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]''.

====Island's sixth decade: the artists====
[[PJ Harvey]]'s eighth studio album, 2011's ''[[Let England Shake]]'', was one of the key records of Island's sixth decade. Made in a cliff-top church in [[Dorset]], it won the 2011 [[Mercury Music Prize]], making Harvey the only artist to land the prestigious award twice (she had prevailed ten years previously with ''[[Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea]]''). [[Mumford & Sons]], who grew out of a series of jam sessions in London in 2007, signed a licensing deal with Island in 2009. Heralded as standard bearers for a vibrant new wave of folkish, countrified rock, their debut album, ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford & Sons album)|Sigh No More]]'', sold two million, reaching number two in Britain and America. It also won best British album at the [[BRIT Awards]] in February 2011. The follow-up, ''[[Babel (Mumford & Sons album)|Babel]]'', did even better in 2012, becoming the UK's fastest-selling album of that year, going to number one in Britain and the US and winning album of the year at the 2013 [[Grammy Awards]]. Island also secured the signing of [[Florence + The Machine]] after songwriter [[Florence Welch]] dropped out of her local art college in [[Camberwell]], South London. Her 2009 debut album, ''[[Lungs (album)|Lungs]]'', sold four million and spent over 12 months in the UK chart before being crowned British album of the year at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2010. ''Lungs'' was followed by 2011's theatrical ''[[Ceremonials]]'', and 2015's more introspective ''[[How Big How Blue How Beautiful]]''.

[[Keane (band)|Keane]] were another of the big successes of Island's sixth decade. Having topped the charts with their five million-selling debut album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'' in 2004, they went on to secure five consecutive number-one albums in the UK (a feat bettered only by [[The Beatles]]), with subsequent releases ''[[Under the Iron Sea]]'' (2006), ''[[Perfect Symmetry (Keane album)|Perfect Symmetry]]'' (2008), ''[[Night Train (EP)|Night Train]]'' (2010) and ''[[Strangeland (album)|Strangeland]]'' (2012) all topping the charts. [[Paul Weller]]'s relationship with Island dates back to his fourth solo album, 1997's ''[[Heavy Soul (Paul Weller album)|Heavy Soul]]'', and its 2000 follow-up [[Heliocentric (Paul Weller album)|Heliocentric]]. He returned to the label in 2008 and began an outstanding trilogy of releases that contained some of his strongest solo work ''[[22 Dreams]]'' (2008), the [[Mercury Music Prize]]-nominated ''[[Wake Up The Nation]]'' (2010) and ''[[Sonik Kicks]]'' (2012).

North London quartet [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] also released four albums on Island, with each one signalling a change of direction: the indie-rock of 2009's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose (2008-09)|I Had The Blues But I Shook Them Loose]]'' paved the way for 2010's folkier ''[[Flaws (album)|Flaws]]'', the modern rock of 2011's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#A Different Kind of Fix (2011-12)|A Different Kind Of Fix]]'' and the broad-based invention of 2014's ''[[So Long, See You Tomorrow (album)|So Long, See You Tomorrow]]''. Having built a loyal live following, [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen]] signed to Island in 2014. After reaching platinum sales status in the UK with their Top Ten debut album, ''[[The Balcony (album)|The Balcony]]'', the Welsh rock band won the BBC Introducing Award at the first [[BBC Music Awards]] in 2014 and were crowned British Breakthrough Act at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2016 (an award voted for by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] listeners). Their second album, 2016's ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]'', was a UK number one.

Island was also responsible for securing major British breakthroughs for two of the 21st century's biggest international superstars in [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[The Weeknd]]. The success of Toronto hip-hop artist Drake came after the label had worked patiently to build his profile over a number of years, culminating in the success of his fourth album ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' and its attendant singles in 2016. \"[[One Dance]]\", Drake's first number one single in the UK, had 1.95 million sales<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-40-biggest-songs-of-2016__17517/ |title=The Official Top 40 Biggest Songs of 2016 |date=2016-12-30 |publisher=The Official UK Charts Company |accessdate=2017-03-19}}</ref> to become Britain's biggest-selling single of 2016. The single's 15-week run at number one equalled the mark for the second longest in UK chart history. With the Island-signed [[Mike Posner]] having held the number one spot with \"[[I Took a Pill in Ibiza]]\" for four consecutive weeks before being replaced by \"One Dance\", Island held the top spot in the UK singles chart for 19 consecutive weeks between March and August 2016. To crown a record-breaking year, Drake was named the world's best-selling recording artist of 2016 by international music industry organisation [[IFPI]] in February 2017.

Canadian singer and songwriter [[The Weeknd]] also cemented his position as one of the world's leading recording artists, with the 2016 success of his third album ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]''. Its success was the culmination of a strategy that had seen Island build his UK profile over a four-year period that dated from his 2013 studio album ''[[Kiss Land]]''. Island's commitment to further nurturing the careers of global superstars was reiterated in June 2016 with the signing of [[Sean Paul]]. The Jamaican singer, rapper and songwriter released \"[[No Lie (Sean Paul song)|No Lie]]\", his first single for Island, in November 2016.

Signed to Island via a licensing deal with independent label PMR, [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]] were formed by two brothers from [[Reigate]] in [[Surrey]], Guy and Howard Lawrence. The duo discovered the joys of nineties [[House music|house]], [[techno]] and [[two-step garage]] while studying music production at college, and went on to enjoy success with their two Island albums ''[[Settle (album)|Settle]]'' (2013) and ''[[Caracal (album)|Caracal]]'' (2015), making extensive use of an array of guest vocalists including [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], [[Jamie Woon]], [[Eliza Doolittle]], [[Lorde]] and [[Gregory Porter]]. One of the acts who guested on ''Settle'' was [[AlunaGeorge]], a boy-girl duo from London (singer Aluna Francis and musician and producer George Reid), who released their debut album, ''Body Music'', on Island in 2013. Like Disclosure, [[Jessie Ware]] signed to Island through a link with independent label [[PMR Records|PMR]]. A soulful singer-songwriter from Brixton, Ware was nominated for the 2012 [[Mercury Music Prize]] with her smooth debut album, [[Devotion (Jessie Ware album)|Devotion]], and enjoyed further success with 2014's [[Tough Love (Jessie Ware album)|Tough Love]]. Another Island act to enjoy a significant breakthrough was Yorkshire singer [[John Newman (singer)|John Newman]], who topped the UK charts with his first solo single, \"[[Love Me Again (song)|Love Me Again]]\", and his debut album [[Tribute (John Newman album)|Tribute]].

In May 2018, incumbent president [[David Massey (music executive)|David Massey]] left Island to join [[Sony Music Entertainment]]'s relaunch of [[Arista Records]]. [[Darcus Beese]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] took on the role of president upon Massey's departure. To make the transition, Beese relocated from the United Kingdom to Island's offices at [[Universal Music Group]]'s New York City building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universalmusic.com/darcus-beese-named-president-island-records/|title=DARCUS BEESE NAMED PRESIDENT OF ISLAND RECORDS|date=2018-05-24|website=UMG|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>

==Manga Entertainment==
Island World Communications, under the leadership of Blackwell and Andy Frain, created [[Manga Entertainment]] Ltd, the anime and live action Japanese film division of Island in 1991. In that year, Laurence Guinness, the Senior VP at Island World Communications bought the distribution license for ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' from ICA Projects in London,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.5/articles/segall1.5.html|title=Manga Entertainment: Taking Anime To The Next Stage|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref> and the distribution of what was the label's first release is considered a crucial milestone in the establishment of anime in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manga Entertainment's 20th Anniversary Party - Page 1|url=http://www.uk-anime.net/articles/Manga_Entertainment's_20th_Anniversary_Party/1|work=UK Anime Network|publisher=Etharius Ltd|accessdate=8 February 2014|author=Robert Frazer|date=June 2011}}</ref> In 1994, Island sold the distribution licenses for most of Manga's releases to Siren Entertainment, an independent entertainment company in Australia. Those rights were then given to Madman Entertainment in 1999 when Siren became solely an acquisitions company.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Artists and recordings==
The recording roster of Island Records, both past and present, has been and continues to be diverse. The label continues to champion new music, a practice that was highlighted at the Island Records 50th anniversary event, at which new artists provided the entertainment.<ref name=\"Fifty\">{{cite web|title=Island Records' 50th Birthday Party - The Constitution,|url=http://www.dailymusicguide.com/Reviews/island-records-50th-birthday-party-the-constitution-27042009-2305.aspx|work=Daily Music Guide|publisher=Daily Music Guide|accessdate=9 February 2014|author=Laura Bruneau|date=27 April 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221093507/http://www.dailymusicguide.com/Reviews/island-records-50th-birthday-party-the-constitution-27042009-2305.aspx|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

'''''Life Is Beautiful''''' ({{lang-it|La vita è bella}}, {{IPA-it|la ˈviːta ˈɛ ˈbɛlla}}) is a 1997 Italian [[comedy-drama]] film directed by and starring [[Roberto Benigni]], who co-wrote the film with [[Vincenzo Cerami]]. Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a [[Italian Jews|Jewish Italian]] bookshop owner, who employs his fertile imagination to shield his son from the horrors of internment in a [[Nazi concentration camp]]. The film was partially inspired by the book ''In the End, I Beat Hitler'' by [[Rubino Romeo Salmonì]] and by Benigni's father, who spent two years in a German labour camp during [[World War II]].

The film grossed over $230 million worldwide, becoming one of the [[List of highest-grossing non-English films|highest-grossing non-English language movies of all time]],<ref>{{cite web

It won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]], nine [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Awards]] (including [[David di Donatello for Best Film|Best Film]]), five [[Nastro d'Argento]] Awards in Italy, two [[European Film Awards]], and three [[71st Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Benigni).

==Plot==
In 1939, in the [[Kingdom of Italy]], Guido Orefice is a young [[History of the Jews in Italy|Jewish]] man who arrives to work in the city (Arezzo, in Tuscany) where his uncle Eliseo operates a restaurant. Guido is comical and sharp, and falls in love with a girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to a rich, but arrogant, man, a local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many \"coincidental\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Finally, Dora sees Guido's affection and promise, and gives in, against her better judgement. He steals her from her engagement party, on a horse, humiliating her fiancé and mother. They are later married and have a son, Giosuè, and run a bookstore.

When [[World War II]] breaks out, Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosuè are seized on Giosuè's birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train and taken to a [[concentration camp]]. After confronting a guard about her husband and son, and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido never see each other during the internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as using the camp's loudspeaker to send messages—symbolic or literal—to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is executed in a [[gas chamber]] shortly after their arrival. Giosuè narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers and were told they were showers.

In the camp, Guido hides their true situation from his son. Guido explains to Giosuè that the camp is a complicated game in which he must perform the tasks Guido gives him. Each of the tasks will earn them points and whoever gets to one thousand points first will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn extra points. Giosuè is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido convinces him each time to continue. At one point Guido takes advantage of the appearance of visiting German officers and their families to show Giosuè that other children are hiding as part of the game, and he also takes advantage of a German nanny thinking Giosuè is one of her charges in order to feed him as Guido serves the German officers. Guido and Giosuè are almost found out to be prisoners by another server until Guido is found teaching all of the German children how to say \"Thank you\" in Italian.

Guido maintains this story right until the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] approach, he tells his son to stay in a box until everybody has left, this being the final task in the competition before the promised tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora, but he is caught by a German soldier. An officer makes the decision to execute Guido, who is led off by the soldier. While he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosuè one last time and winks, still in character and playing the game. Guido is then shot and left for dead in an alleyway. The next morning, Giosuè emerges from the sweat-box, just as a [[United States Army|US Army]] unit led by a [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]] arrives and the camp is liberated. Giosuè is overjoyed about winning the game (unaware that his father is dead), thinking that he won the tank, and an American soldier allows Giosuè to ride on the tank. While travelling to safety, Giosuè soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and reunites with his mother. While the young Giosuè excitedly tells his mother about how he had won a tank, just as his father had promised, the adult Giosuè, in an overheard monologue, reminisces on the sacrifices his father made for him and his story.

The film holds a \"Fresh\" 80% approval rating on review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 87 reviews with an average rating of 7.58/10.

'''''Life Is Beautiful''''' ({{lang-it|La vita è bella}}, {{IPA-it|la ˈviːta ˈɛ ˈbɛlla}}) is a 1997 Italian [[comedy-drama]] film directed by and starring [[Roberto Benigni]], who co-wrote the film with [[Vincenzo Cerami]]. Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a [[Italian Jews|Jewish Italian]] bookshop owner, who employs his fertile imagination to shield his son from the horrors of internment in a [[Nazi concentration camp]]. The film was partially inspired by the book ''In the End, I Beat Hitler'' by [[Rubino Romeo Salmonì]] and by Benigni's father, who spent two years in a German labour camp during [[World War II]].

The film was a critical and financial success. It grossed over $230 million worldwide, becoming one of the [[List of highest-grossing non-English films|highest-grossing non-English language movies of all time]],<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> and received widespread acclaim (despite some criticisms of using the subject matter for comedic purposes). It won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]], nine [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Awards]] (including [[David di Donatello for Best Film|Best Film]]), five [[Nastro d'Argento]] Awards in Italy, two [[European Film Awards]], and three [[71st Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Benigni).

==Plot==
In 1939, in the [[Kingdom of Italy]], Guido Orefice is a young [[History of the Jews in Italy|Jewish]] man who arrives to work in the city (Arezzo, in Tuscany) where his uncle Eliseo operates a restaurant. Guido is comical and sharp, and falls in love with a girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to a rich, but arrogant, man, a local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many \"coincidental\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Finally, Dora sees Guido's affection and promise, and gives in, against her better judgement. He steals her from her engagement party, on a horse, humiliating her fiancé and mother. They are later married and have a son, Giosuè, and run a bookstore.

When [[World War II]] breaks out, Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosuè are seized on Giosuè's birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train and taken to a [[concentration camp]]. After confronting a guard about her husband and son, and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido never see each other during the internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as using the camp's loudspeaker to send messages—symbolic or literal—to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is executed in a [[gas chamber]] shortly after their arrival. Giosuè narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers and were told they were showers.

In the camp, Guido hides their true situation from his son. Guido explains to Giosuè that the camp is a complicated game in which he must perform the tasks Guido gives him. Each of the tasks will earn them points and whoever gets to one thousand points first will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn extra points. Giosuè is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido convinces him each time to continue. At one point Guido takes advantage of the appearance of visiting German officers and their families to show Giosuè that other children are hiding as part of the game, and he also takes advantage of a German nanny thinking Giosuè is one of her charges in order to feed him as Guido serves the German officers. Guido and Giosuè are almost found out to be prisoners by another server until Guido is found teaching all of the German children how to say \"Thank you\" in Italian.

Guido maintains this story right until the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] approach, he tells his son to stay in a box until everybody has left, this being the final task in the competition before the promised tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora, but he is caught by a German soldier. An officer makes the decision to execute Guido, who is led off by the soldier. While he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosuè one last time and winks, still in character and playing the game. Guido is then shot and left for dead in an alleyway. The next morning, Giosuè emerges from the sweat-box, just as a [[United States Army|US Army]] unit led by a [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]] arrives and the camp is liberated. Giosuè is overjoyed about winning the game (unaware that his father is dead), thinking that he won the tank, and an American soldier allows Giosuè to ride on the tank. While travelling to safety, Giosuè soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and reunites with his mother. While the young Giosuè excitedly tells his mother about how he had won a tank, just as his father had promised, the adult Giosuè, in an overheard monologue, reminisces on the sacrifices his father made for him and his story.

Director [[Roberto Benigni]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Vincenzo Cerami]], was inspired by the story of [[Rubino Romeo Salmonì]] and his book ''In the End, I Beat Hitler'', which incorporates elements of irony and [[black comedy]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/8631266/Life-Is-Beautiful-Nazi-death-camp-survivor-dies-aged-91.html |title=Life Is Beautiful Nazi death camp survivor dies aged 91 |last=Squires |first=Nick |date=11 July 2011 |accessdate=11 September 2016 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323074652/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/8631266/Life-Is-Beautiful-Nazi-death-camp-survivor-dies-aged-91.html |archive-date=23 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Salmoni was an Italian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz, survived and was reunited with his parents, but found his brothers were murdered.

===Critical response===
[[File:Roberto Benigni Nicoletta Braschi.jpg|thumb|[[Roberto Benigni]] received positive reviews for his film and performance, which he starred in with his wife [[Nicoletta Braschi]].]] 
The film was praised by the Italian press, with Benigni treated as a \"national hero.\"<ref name=\"Stone\" /> [[Pope John Paul II]], who received a private screening with Benigni, placed it in his top five favourite films.<ref name=\"Stone\" /> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three and a half stars, stating, \"At Cannes, it offended some left-wing critics with its use of humor in connection with the Holocaust. What may be most offensive to both wings is its sidestepping of politics in favor of simple human ingenuity. The film finds the right notes to negotiate its delicate subject matter.\"<ref name=\"Roger Ebert\">{{cite web |url=https://rogerebert.com/reviews/life-is-beautiful-1998 |title=Life Is Beautiful |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=30 October 1998 |accessdate=11 September 2016 |website=Rogerebert.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925213925/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/life-is-beautiful-1998 |archive-date=25 September 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Michael O'Sullivan, writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', called it \"sad, funny and haunting.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/movies/reviews/lifeisbeautifulosullivan.htm |title='Life's' Surprisingly Graceful Turn' |last=O'Sullivan |first=Michael |date=30 October 1998 |accessdate=11 September 2016 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919153705/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/movies/reviews/lifeisbeautifulosullivan.htm |archive-date=19 September 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the film took \"a colossal amount of gall\" but \"because Mr. Benigni can be heart-rending without a trace of the maudlin, it works.\"<ref name=\"Maslin\" /> ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}}s [[Kenneth Turan]] noted the film had \"some furious opposition\" at Cannes, but said \"what is surprising about this unlikely film is that it succeeds as well as it does.

In 2002, [[BBC]] critic Tom Dawson wrote \"the film is presumably intended as a tribute to the powers of imagination, innocence, and love in the most harrowing of circumstances,\" but \"Benigni's sentimental fantasy diminishes the suffering of Holocaust victims.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/06/06/la_vita_e_bella_1997_review.shtml |title=La Vita è Bella (Life is Beautiful) (1998) |last=Dawson |first=Tom |date=6 June 2002 |accessdate=12 September 2016 |work=[[BBC]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726215746/http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/06/06/la_vita_e_bella_1997_review.shtml |archive-date=26 July 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2006, [[Jewish American]] comedic filmmaker [[Mel Brooks]] spoke negatively of the film in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', noting Benigni is a Gentile and had no family die in concentration camps.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/spiegel-interview-with-mel-brooks-with-comedy-we-can-rob-hitler-of-his-posthumous-power-a-406268.html |title=SPIEGEL Interview with Mel Brooks: With Comedy, We Can Rob Hitler of his Posthumous Power |last=Brooks |first=Mel |work=[[Spiegel Online]] |date=16 March 2006 |accessdate=3 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610031938/http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/spiegel-interview-with-mel-brooks-with-comedy-we-can-rob-hitler-of-his-posthumous-power-a-406268.html |archive-date=10 June 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> By contrast, Nobel Laureate [[Imre Kertész]] argues that those who take the film to be a comedy, rather than a tragedy, have missed the point of the film.

'''Glycerol''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|l|ɪ|s|ə|r|ɒ|l}};<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/glycerol|title=glycerol - Definition of glycerol in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}</ref> also called '''glycerine''' or '''glycerin''') is a simple [[polyol]] compound. It is a colorless, odorless, [[viscous]] liquid that is sweet-tasting and non-toxic. The glycerol backbone is found in those [[lipid]]s known as [[glyceride]]s. Due to having antimicrobial and antiviral properties it is widely used in FDA approved wound and burn treatments. It can also be used as an effective marker to measure liver disease. It is also widely used as a sweetener in the food industry and as a [[humectant]] in [[pharmaceutical formulation]]s. Owing to the presence of three [[hydroxyl group]]s, glycerol is [[miscible]] with [[water]] and is [[Hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] in nature.<ref name=\"Ullmann\"/>

==Structure==
Although [[chirality|achiral]], glycerol is [[prochirality|prochiral]] with respect to reactions of one of the two primary alcohols. Thus, in substituted derivatives, the [[Glycerophospholipid#Nomenclature and stereochemistry|stereospecific numbering]] labels the molecule with a \"sn-\" prefix before the stem name of the molecule.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hirschmann|first=H.|date=1960-10-01|title=The Nature of Substrate Asymmetry in Stereoselective Reactions|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=235|issue=10|pages=2762–2767|pmid=13714619}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |date=1967-09-01|title=IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN)|journal=European Journal of Biochemistry|volume=2|issue=2|pages=127–131|doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1967.tb00116.x|pmid=6078528}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid29301208\">{{cite journal | vauthors=Alfieri A, Imperlini E, Nigro E, Vitucci D, Orrù S, Daniele A, Buono P, Mancini A | title=Effects of Plant Oil Interesterified Triacylglycerols on Lipemia and Human Healthy | journal= [[International Journal of Molecular Sciences]] | volume=19 | issue=1 | pages=E104 | year=2017 | doi= 10.3390/ijms19010104 |  pmc =5796054 | pmid = 29301208 }}</ref>

==Production==
Glycerol is generally obtained from plant and animal sources where it occurs in [[triglyceride]]s, [[ester]]s of glycerol with long-chain carboxylic acids. The [[hydrolysis]], [[saponification]], or [[transesterification]] of these triglycerides produces glycerol as well as the fatty acid derivative:
<div style=\"display: flex; max-width: 100%; overflow-x: auto\">

{{Biochem reaction subunit|n=3|compound=soap|image=General sodium carboxylate.svg}}
{{Biochem reaction subunit|compound=glycerol|image=Glycerine Structural Formula V1.svg}}
</div>
[[Triglycerides]] can be [[saponification|saponified]] with [[sodium hydroxide]] to give glycerol and fatty sodium salt or [[soap]].

Typical plant sources include [[soybeans]] or [[Arecaceae|palm]]. Animal-derived [[tallow]] is another source. Approximately 950,000 tons per year are produced in the United States and Europe; 350,000 tons of glycerol were produced per year in the United States alone from 2000 to 2004.<ref>{{cite web |title= A Glycerin Factor |author= Nilles, Dave |url= http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/article.jsp?article_id=377 |publisher= Biodiesel Magazine |year= 2005}}</ref> The [[Directive on the Promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport|EU directive 2003/30/EC]] set a requirement that 5.75% of petroleum fuels are to be replaced with [[biofuel]] sources across all [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] by 2010. It was projected in 2006 that by the year 2020, production would be six times more than demand, creating an excess of glycerol.<ref name=\"Ullmann\">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |last1= Christoph |first1= Ralf |last2= Schmidt |first2= Bernd |last3= Steinberner |first3= Udo |last4= Dilla |first4= Wolfgang |last5= Karinen |first5= Reetta |title= Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year= 2006 |doi= 10.1002/14356007.a12_477.pub2 |chapter= Glycerol |isbn= 3527306730}}</ref>

Glycerol from triglycerides is produced on a large scale, but the crude product is of variable quality, with a low selling price of as low as 2-5 U.S. cents per kilogram in 2011.<ref>Pei San Kong, Mohamed Kheireddine Aroua, Wan Mohd Ashri Wan Daud, \"Conversion of crude and pure glycerol into derivatives: A feasibility evaluation\", Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 2016, Volume 63, pp. 533-555. {{doi|10.1016/j.rser.2016.05.054}}</ref> It can be purified, but the process is expensive. Some glycerol is burned for energy, but its heat value is low.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/articles/8137/clearing-the-way-for-byproduct-quality |work=Biodiesel Magazine |title= Clearing the way for byproduct quality: why quality for glycerin is just as important for biodiesel |author= Sims, Bryan |date= 25 October 2011}}</ref>

Crude glycerol from the [[hydrolysis]] of triglycerides can be purified by treatment with [[activated carbon]] to remove organic impurities, alkali to remove unreacted glycerol esters, and [[ion exchange]] to remove salts. High purity glycerol (> 99.5%) is obtained by multi-step distillation; a [[vacuum chamber]] is necessary due to its high boiling point (290&nbsp;°C).<ref name=Ullmann/>

===Synthetic glycerol===
Although usually not cost-effective, glycerol can be produced by various routes from [[propylene]]. The epichlorohydrin process is the most important: it involves the [[Chlorination reaction|chlorination]] of propylene to give [[allyl chloride]], which is oxidized with [[hypochlorite]] to [[dichlorohydrins]], which reacts with a strong base to give [[epichlorohydrin]]. This epichlorohydrin is then [[hydrolyzed]] to give glycerol. [[Chlorine]]-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from [[acrolein]] and [[propylene oxide]].<ref name=\"Ullmann\"/>
:[[File:Synthetic routes to glycerol.png|600px]]

Because of the large-scale production of [[biodiesel]] from fats, where glycerol is a waste product, the market for glycerol is depressed. Thus, synthetic processes are not [[economical]]. Owing to oversupply, efforts are being made to convert glycerol to synthetic precursors, such as [[acrolein]] and epichlorohydrin.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Glycerol|last= Yu|first= Bin|journal= Synlett|volume= 25|issue= 4|pages= 601–602|doi= 10.1055/s-0033-1340636|year= 2014|doi-access= free}}</ref> (See the [[#Chemical intermediate|Chemical intermediate]] section of this article).

==Applications==

===Food industry===
In food and beverages, glycerol serves as a [[humectant]], [[solvent]], and [[sweetener]], and may help [[Food preservative|preserve foods]]. It is also used as filler in commercially prepared [[low-fat]] foods (e.g., [[cookie]]s), and as a [[thickening agent]] in [[liqueur]]s. Glycerol and water are used to preserve certain types of plant leaves.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://extension.umd.edu//sites/extension.umd.edu/files/_images/programs/hgic/Publications/non_HGIC_FS/FS556.pdf |title= Preserving flowers and leaves |last= Gouin |first= Francis R.|year=1994 |journal=Maryland Cooperative Extension Fact Sheet |volume=556 |pages=1–6|accessdate=20 January 2018}}</ref><!--<ref>{{cite web |title= Preserving flowers and decorative foliages with glycerin and dye |author= Stevens, Alan |url= http://www.ksre.ksu.edu/library/hort2/mf2446.pdf }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>--> As a [[sugar substitute]], it has approximately 27 [[Food energy|kilocalories]] per [[teaspoon]] (sugar has 20) and is 60% as [[Sweetness|sweet]] as [[sucrose]]. It does not feed the [[bacteria]] that form [[dental plaque|plaque]]s and cause [[dental cavities]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} As a [[food additive]], glycerol is labeled as [[E number]] E422. It is added to icing (frosting) to prevent it from setting too hard.

As used in foods, glycerol is categorized by the U.S. [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] as a [[carbohydrate]]. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) carbohydrate designation includes all caloric [[macronutrient]]s excluding protein and fat. Glycerol has a caloric density similar to table sugar, but a lower [[glycemic index]] and different [[metabolic pathway]] within the body, so some dietary advocates{{who|date=September 2014}} accept glycerol as a sweetener compatible with [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s.

It is also recommended as an additive when using polyol sweeteners such as [[erythritol]] and [[xylitol]] which have a cooling effect, due to its heating effect in the mouth, if the cooling effect is not wanted.<ref>{{cite web |title= Functional Food Design Rules |author= Nikolov, Ivan |url= http://www.ivannikolov.com/functional-food-design-rules-part-2/}}</ref>

===Medical, pharmaceutical and personal care applications===
[[File:Glycerin bottle.jpg|thumb|A bottle of glycerin purchased at a pharmacy]]
[[File:Gleitmittel Personal Lubricants.jpg|thumb|Personal lubricants commonly contain glycerol]]
[[File:Dollop of hair gel.jpg|thumb|Glycerol is an ingredient in products such as hair gel]]
[[File:Glycerin suppositories.jpg|thumb|right|Glycerol suppositories used as laxatives]]

Glycerin is mildly antimicrobial and antiviral and is an FDA approved treatment for wounds. The Red Cross reports that an 85% solution of glycerin shows bactericidal and antiviral effects, and wounds treated with glycerin show reduced inflammation after roughly 2 hours. Due to this it is used widely in wound care products, including glycerin based [[Hydrogel dressing|hydrogel]] sheets for burns and other wound care. It is approved for all types of wound care except third degree burns, and is used to package donor skin used in skin grafts. There is no topical treatment approved for third degree burns, and so this limitation is not exclusive to glycerin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stout |first1=Edward I. |last2=McKessor |first2=Angie |title=Glycerin-Based Hydrogel for Infection Control |journal=Advances in Wound Care |date=February 2012 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=48–51 |doi=10.1089/wound.2011.0288 |pmid=24527279 |pmc=3839013 }}</ref>

Glycerol is used in [[medicine|medical]], [[pharmaceutical]] and [[personal care]] preparations, often as a means of improving smoothness, providing [[lubrication]], and as a [[humectant]].

[[Ichthyosis]] and [[xerosis]] have been relieved by the topical use glycerin.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ichthyosis: New Insights for the Healthcare Professional|date=22 July 2013|publisher=[[ScholarlyEditions]]|language=English|isbn=9781481659666|page=22}}</ref><ref name=\"LebwohlHeymann2017\">{{cite book|title=Treatment of Skin Disease E-Book: Comprehensive Therapeutic Strategies|date=19 September 2017|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|language=English|isbn=9780702069130|author=Mark G. Lebwohl, Warren R. Heymann, John Berth-Jones, Ian Coulson}}</ref> It is found in allergen [[immunotherapies]], [[cough syrup]]s, [[elixir]]s and [[expectorant]]s, [[toothpaste]], [[mouthwash]]es, [[skin care]] products, shaving cream, [[hair care]] products, [[soap]]s, and water-based [[personal lubricant]]s. In solid dosage forms like tablets, glycerol is used as a tablet holding agent. For human consumption, glycerol is classified by the U.S. FDA among the [[sugar alcohol]]s as a caloric macronutrient. Glycerol is also used in [[blood banking]] to preserve [[red blood cell]]s prior to freezing.

Glycerol is a component of [[glycerin soap]].<!-- PLEASE DO NOT try to enumerate the ingredients for glycerine soap. There are a million differing recipes, each with its own \"purist\" contingent that swears they are the one true glycerine soapmaker --> [[Essential oil]]s are added for [[fragrance]]. This kind of soap is used by people with sensitive, easily irritated [[skin]] because it prevents skin dryness with its [[moisturizer|moisturizing]] properties. It draws moisture up through skin layers and slows or prevents excessive drying and evaporation.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Taken rectally, glycerol functions as a [[laxative]] by irritating the anal mucosa and inducing a [[Osmotic laxative|hyperosmotic effect]],<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.drugs.com/cdi/glycerin-enema.html |title= Glycerin Enema |publisher= Drugs.com |accessdate=17 November 2012}}</ref> expanding the [[Large intestine|colon]] by drawing water into it to induce [[peristalsis]] resulting in [[Defecation|evacuation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-drug/def/glycerin-enema |title=glycerin enema |work=NCI Drug Dictionary |publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]] |accessdate=2019-05-02 |date=2 February 2011 }}</ref> It may be administered undiluted either as a [[suppository]] or as a small-volume (2–10&nbsp;ml) [[enema]]. Alternatively, it may be administered in a dilute solution, e.g., 5%, as a high volume enema.<ref>{{Citation | author = E. Bertani, A. Chiappa, R. Biffi, P. P. Bianchi, D. Radice, V. Branchi, S.

Taken orally (often mixed with fruit juice to reduce its sweet taste), glycerol can cause a rapid, temporary decrease in the [[Intraocular pressure|internal pressure of the eye]]. This can be useful for the initial emergency treatment of severely elevated eye pressure.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-information/DR601713 |title= Glycerin (Oral Route) |publisher= Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate= 17 November 2012}}</ref>

Glycerol has also been incorporated as a component of [[bio-ink]] formulations in the field of [[3D bioprinting|bioprinting]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Atala|first=Anthony|last2=Yoo|first2=James J.|last3=Carlos Kengla|last4=Ko|first4=In Kap|last5=Lee|first5=Sang Jin|last6=Kang|first6=Hyun-Wook|date=March 2016|title=A 3D bioprinting system to produce human-scale tissue constructs with structural integrity|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=312–319|doi=10.1038/nbt.3413|pmid=26878319|issn=1546-1696}}</ref> The glycerol content acts to add viscosity to the bio-ink without adding large protein, carbohydrate, or glycoprotein molecules.

===Botanical extracts===
When utilized in \"tincture\" method extractions, specifically as a 10% solution, glycerol prevents tannins from precipitating in ethanol extracts of plants ([[tincture]]s). It is also used as an \"alcohol-free\" alternative to ethanol as a solvent in preparing herbal extractions. It is less extractive when utilized in a standard tincture methodology. Alcohol-based tinctures can also have the alcohol removed and replaced with glycerol for its preserving properties. Such products are not \"alcohol-free\" in a scientific sense, as glycerol contains three hydroxyl groups. [[Fluid extract]] manufacturers often extract herbs in hot water before adding glycerol to make [[glycerite]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Long |first1=Walter S. |title=The Composition of Commercial Fruit Extracts |journal=Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science |date=14 January 1916 |volume=28 |pages=157–161 |doi=10.2307/3624347 |jstor=3624347 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.newhope.com/nutritionsciencenews/NSN_backs/Apr_99/backtalk.cfm Does alcohol belong in herbal tinctures?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012040650/http://newhope.com/nutritionsciencenews/NSN_backs/Apr_99/backtalk.cfm |date=12 October 2007 }} newhope.com</ref>

When used as a primary \"true\" alcohol-free botanical extraction solvent in non-tincture based methodologies, glycerol has been shown to possess a high degree of extractive versatility for botanicals including removal of numerous constituents and complex compounds, with an extractive power that can rival that of alcohol and water–alcohol solutions.<ref>https://www.aciscience.org/docs/Glycerine_-_an_overview.pdf{{full citation needed|date=December 2019}}</ref> That glycerol possesses such high extractive power assumes it is utilized with dynamic methodologies as opposed to standard passive \"tincturing\" methodologies that are better suited to alcohol. Glycerol possesses the intrinsic property of not denaturing or rendering a botanical's constituents inert (as alcohols – i.e. ethyl (grain) alcohol, methyl (wood) alcohol, etc., do). Glycerol is a stable preserving agent for botanical extracts that, when utilized in proper concentrations in an extraction solvent base, does not allow inverting or reduction-oxidation of a finished extract's constituents, even over several years.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Both glycerol and ethanol are viable preserving agents. Glycerol is [[bacteriostatic]] in its action, and ethanol is bactericidal in its action.<ref>Lawrie, James W. (1928) ''Glycerol and the glycols – production, properties and analysis''.

===Electronic cigarette liquid===
[[File:E-Cigarette-Electronic Cigarette-E-Cigs-E-Liquid-Vaping-Cloud Chasing (16348040092).jpg|thumb|Glycerin is often used in [[electronic cigarettes]] to create the vapor]]
Glycerin, along with [[propylene glycol]], is a common component of [[construction of electronic cigarettes#E-cigarette liquid|e-liquid]], a solution used with electronic vaporizers ([[electronic cigarettes]]). This glycerol is heated with an [[Atomizer nozzle|atomizer]] (a heating coil often made of [[Kanthal (alloy)|Kanthal]] wire), producing the [[aerosol]] that delivers [[nicotine]] to the user.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Amitava|last2=Klein|first2=Kimberly|title=Antioxidants in Food, Vitamins and Supplements: Prevention and Treatment of Disease|date=2014|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780124059177|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5iiSAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA67&dq=propylene%20glycol%20electronic%20cigarettes&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=16 August 2017|chapter=4.2.5 Are Electronic Cigarettes Safe?}}</ref>

===Antifreeze===
{{Main|Antifreeze}}
Like [[ethylene glycol]] and [[propylene glycol]], glycerol is a non-ionic [[kosmotropic|kosmotrope]] that forms strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules, competing with water-water [[hydrogen bonds]]. This interaction disrupts the formation of ice. The minimum freezing point temperature is about {{convert|−36|F|C}} corresponding to 70% glycerol in water.

Glycerol was historically used as an anti-freeze for automotive applications before being replaced by [[ethylene glycol]], which has a lower freezing point. While the minimum freezing point of a glycerol-water mixture is higher than an ethylene glycol-water mixture, glycerol is not toxic and is being re-examined for use in automotive applications.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Hudgens |first1= R.

In the laboratory, glycerol is a common component of solvents for [[enzyme|enzymatic]] [[reagents]] stored at temperatures below 0&nbsp;°C due to the [[Freezing-point depression|depression of the freezing temperature]]. It is also used as a [[cryoprotectant]] where the glycerol is dissolved in water to reduce damage by ice crystals to laboratory organisms that are stored in frozen solutions, such as [[bacteria]], [[nematode]]s, and mammalian embryos.

===Chemical intermediate===
Glycerol is used to produce [[nitroglycerin]], which is an essential ingredient of various explosives such as [[dynamite]], [[gelignite]], and propellants like [[cordite]]. Reliance on soap-making to supply co-product glycerol made it difficult to increase production to meet wartime demand. Hence, synthetic glycerol processes were national defense priorities in the days leading up to World War II. Nitroglycerin, also known as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is commonly used to relieve ''[[angina pectoris]]'', taken in the form of [[sub-lingual]] tablets, or as an [[aerosol]] spray.

An oxidation of glycerol affords [[mesoxalic acid]].<ref name=\"ciri2\">

</ref>

===Vibration damping===
Glycerol is used as fill for [[pressure gauge]]s to damp vibration. External vibrations, from compressors, engines, pumps, etc., produce [[harmonic oscillation|harmonic]] vibrations within [[Bourdon gauge]]s that can cause the needle to move excessively, giving inaccurate readings. The excessive swinging of the needle can also damage internal gears or other components, causing premature wear. Glycerol, when poured into a gauge to replace the air space, reduces the harmonic vibrations that are transmitted to the needle, increasing the lifetime and reliability of the gauge.<ref>''Pneumatic Systems: Principles and Maintenance'' by S. R. Majumdar -- McGraw-Hill 2006 Page 74</ref>

===Niche uses===

====Film industry====
Glycerol is used by the film industry when filming scenes involving water to stop areas from drying out too quickly.<ref>[http://www.reagent.co.uk/blog/chemicals-in-film-20th-century-fox-orders-products/ Chemicals in Film]. reagent.co.uk</ref>

Glycerine is used—combined with water (around in a 1:99 proportion)—to create a smooth smoky environment. The solution is vaporized and pushed into the room with a ventilator.

====Ultrasonic couplant====
Glycerol can be sometimes used as replacement for [[water]] in [[ultrasonic testing]], as it has favourably higher [[acoustic impedance]] (2.42MRayl vs 1.483MRayl for [[water]]) while being relatively safe, non-toxic, non-corrosive and relatively low cost.<ref>[https://www.nde-ed.org/GeneralResources/MaterialProperties/UT/ut_matlprop_liquids.htm Acoustic Properties for Liquids]. nde-ed.org</ref>

====Bubble Mixture====
Glycerol is added to bubble mixture for blowing [[soap bubbles]]. It creates longer-lasting bubbles by reducing water evaporation.

===Internal combustion fuel===
Glycerol is also used to power diesel generators supplying electricity for the [[FIA]] [[Formula E]] series of electric race cars.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150212152226/http://www.fiaformulae.com/en/news/2014/september/formula-e-uses-pollution-free-glycerine-to-charge-cars.aspx Formula E uses pollution-free glycerine to charge cars]. fiaformulae.com. 13 September 2014</ref>

==Metabolism==
Glycerol is a precursor for synthesis of [[triacylglycerol]]s and of [[phospholipid]]s in the liver and [[adipose tissue]]. When the body uses stored fat as a source of energy, glycerol and [[fatty acid]]s are released into the bloodstream.

Glycerol is mainly metabolized in the liver. Glycerol injections can be used as a simple test for liver damage, as its rate of absorption by the liver is considered an accurate measure of liver health. Glycerol metabolization is reduced in both cirrhosis and fatty liver disease.<ref>Glycerol clearance in alcoholic liver disease. Gut (British Society of Gastroenterology). 1982 Apr; 23(4): 257–264. D G Johnston, K G Alberti, R Wright, P G Blain</ref><ref>Fatty liver disrupts glycerol metabolism in gluconeogenic and lipogenic pathways in humans. September 2018 The Journal of Lipid Research, 59, 1685-1694. Jeffrey D. Browning, Eunsook S. Jin1, Rebecca E. Murphy, and Craig R. Malloy</ref>

Blood Glycerol levels are highly elevated during Diabetes, and is believed to be the cause of reduced fertility in patients who suffer from Diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Blood Glycerol levels in Diabetic patients average three times higher than healthy controls. Direct Glycerol treatment of testes has been found to cause significant long term reduction in sperm count. Further testing on this subject was abandoned due to the unexpected results, as this was not the goal of the experiment.<ref>Molecular Human Reproduction, Volume 23, Issue 11, November 2017, Pages 725–737</ref>

Circulating glycerol does not [[glycate]] proteins as do glucose or fructose, and does not lead to the formation of [[advanced glycation endproduct]]s (AGEs). In some{{which|date=November 2015}} organisms, the glycerol component can enter the glycolysis pathway directly and, thus, provide energy for cellular metabolism (or, potentially, be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis).

Before glycerol can enter the pathway of [[glycolysis]] or [[gluconeogenesis]] (depending on physiological conditions), it must be converted to their intermediate [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]] in the following steps:

'''Glycerol''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|l|ɪ|s|ə|r|ɒ|l}};<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/glycerol|title=glycerol - Definition of glycerol in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}</ref> also called '''glycerine''' or '''glycerin''') is a simple [[polyol]] compound. It is a colorless, odorless, [[viscous]] liquid that is sweet-tasting and non-toxic. The glycerol backbone is found in those [[lipid]]s known as [[glyceride]]s. Due to having antimicrobial and antiviral properties it is widely used in FDA approved wound and burn treatments. It can also be used as an effective marker to measure liver disease. It is also widely used as a sweetener in the food industry and as a [[humectant]] in [[pharmaceutical formulation]]s. Owing to the presence of three [[hydroxyl group]]s, glycerol is [[miscible]] with [[water]] and is [[Hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] in nature.<ref name=\"Ullmann\"/>

==Structure==
Although [[chirality|achiral]], glycerol is [[prochirality|prochiral]] with respect to reactions of one of the two primary alcohols. Thus, in substituted derivatives, the [[Glycerophospholipid#Nomenclature and stereochemistry|stereospecific numbering]] labels the molecule with a \"sn-\" prefix before the stem name of the molecule.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hirschmann|first=H.|date=1960-10-01|title=The Nature of Substrate Asymmetry in Stereoselective Reactions|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=235|issue=10|pages=2762–2767|pmid=13714619}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |date=1967-09-01|title=IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN)|journal=European Journal of Biochemistry|volume=2|issue=2|pages=127–131|doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1967.tb00116.x|pmid=6078528}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid29301208\">{{cite journal | vauthors=Alfieri A, Imperlini E, Nigro E, Vitucci D, Orrù S, Daniele A, Buono P, Mancini A | title=Effects of Plant Oil Interesterified Triacylglycerols on Lipemia and Human Healthy | journal= [[International Journal of Molecular Sciences]] | volume=19 | issue=1 | pages=E104 | year=2017 | doi= 10.3390/ijms19010104 |  pmc =5796054 | pmid = 29301208 }}</ref>

==Production==
Glycerol is generally obtained from plant and animal sources where it occurs in [[triglyceride]]s, [[ester]]s of glycerol with long-chain carboxylic acids. The [[hydrolysis]], [[saponification]], or [[transesterification]] of these triglycerides produces glycerol as well as the fatty acid derivative:

[[Triglycerides]] can be [[saponification|saponified]] with [[sodium hydroxide]] to give glycerol and fatty sodium salt or [[soap]].

Typical plant sources include [[soybeans]] or [[Arecaceae|palm]]. Animal-derived [[tallow]] is another source. Approximately 950,000 tons per year are produced in the United States and Europe; 350,000 tons of glycerol were produced per year in the United States alone from 2000 to 2004.<ref>{{cite web |title= A Glycerin Factor |author= Nilles, Dave |url= http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/article.jsp?article_id=377 |publisher= Biodiesel Magazine |year= 2005}}</ref> The [[Directive on the Promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport|EU directive 2003/30/EC]] set a requirement that 5.75% of petroleum fuels are to be replaced with [[biofuel]] sources across all [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] by 2010. It was projected in 2006 that by the year 2020, production would be six times more than demand, creating an excess of glycerol.<ref name=\"Ullmann\">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |last1= Christoph |first1= Ralf |last2= Schmidt |first2= Bernd |last3= Steinberner |first3= Udo |last4= Dilla |first4= Wolfgang |last5= Karinen |first5= Reetta |title= Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year= 2006 |doi= 10.1002/14356007.a12_477.pub2 |chapter= Glycerol |isbn= 3527306730}}</ref>

Glycerol from triglycerides is produced on a large scale, but the crude product is of variable quality, with a low selling price of as low as 2-5 U.S. cents per kilogram in 2011.<ref>Pei San Kong, Mohamed Kheireddine Aroua, Wan Mohd Ashri Wan Daud, \"Conversion of crude and pure glycerol into derivatives: A feasibility evaluation\", Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 2016, Volume 63, pp. 533-555. {{doi|10.1016/j.rser.2016.05.054}}</ref> It can be purified, but the process is expensive.

Crude glycerol from the [[hydrolysis]] of triglycerides can be purified by treatment with [[activated carbon]] to remove organic impurities, alkali to remove unreacted glycerol esters, and [[ion exchange]] to remove salts. High purity glycerol (> 99.5%) is obtained by multi-step distillation; a [[vacuum chamber]] is necessary due to its high boiling point (290&nbsp;°C).<ref name=Ullmann/>

===Synthetic glycerol===
Although usually not cost-effective, glycerol can be produced by various routes from [[propylene]]. The epichlorohydrin process is the most important: it involves the [[Chlorination reaction|chlorination]] of propylene to give [[allyl chloride]], which is oxidized with [[hypochlorite]] to [[dichlorohydrins]], which reacts with a strong base to give [[epichlorohydrin]]. This epichlorohydrin is then [[hydrolyzed]] to give glycerol. [[Chlorine]]-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from [[acrolein]] and [[propylene oxide]].<ref name=\"Ullmann\"/>
:[[File:Synthetic routes to glycerol.png|600px]]

Because of the large-scale production of [[biodiesel]] from fats, where glycerol is a waste product, the market for glycerol is depressed. Thus, synthetic processes are not [[economical]]. Owing to oversupply, efforts are being made to convert glycerol to synthetic precursors, such as [[acrolein]] and epichlorohydrin.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Glycerol|last= Yu|first= Bin|journal= Synlett|volume= 25|issue= 4|pages= 601–602|doi= 10.1055/s-0033-1340636|year= 2014|doi-access= free}}</ref> (See the [[#Chemical intermediate|Chemical intermediate]] section of this article).

==Applications==

===Food industry===
In food and beverages, glycerol serves as a [[humectant]], [[solvent]], and [[sweetener]], and may help [[Food preservative|preserve foods]]. It is also used as filler in commercially prepared [[low-fat]] foods (e.g., [[cookie]]s), and as a [[thickening agent]] in [[liqueur]]s. Glycerol and water are used to preserve certain types of plant leaves.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://extension.umd.edu//sites/extension.umd.edu/files/_images/programs/hgic/Publications/non_HGIC_FS/FS556.pdf |title= Preserving flowers and leaves |last= Gouin |first= Francis R.|year=1994 |journal=Maryland Cooperative Extension Fact Sheet |volume=556 |pages=1–6|accessdate=20 January 2018}}</ref><!--<ref>{{cite web |title= Preserving flowers and decorative foliages with glycerin and dye |author= Stevens, Alan |url= http://www.ksre.ksu.edu/library/hort2/mf2446.pdf }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>--> As a [[sugar substitute]], it has approximately 27 [[Food energy|kilocalories]] per [[teaspoon]] (sugar has 20) and is 60% as [[Sweetness|sweet]] as [[sucrose]]. It does not feed the [[bacteria]] that form [[dental plaque|plaque]]s and cause [[dental cavities]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} As a [[food additive]], glycerol is labeled as [[E number]] E422. It is added to icing (frosting) to prevent it from setting too hard.

As used in foods, glycerol is categorized by the U.S. [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] as a [[carbohydrate]]. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) carbohydrate designation includes all caloric [[macronutrient]]s excluding protein and fat. Glycerol has a caloric density similar to table sugar, but a lower [[glycemic index]] and different [[metabolic pathway]] within the body, so some dietary advocates{{who|date=September 2014}} accept glycerol as a sweetener compatible with [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s.

It is also recommended as an additive when using polyol sweeteners such as [[erythritol]] and [[xylitol]] which have a cooling effect, due to its heating effect in the mouth, if the cooling effect is not wanted.<ref>{{cite web |title= Functional Food Design Rules |author= Nikolov, Ivan |url= http://www.ivannikolov.com/functional-food-design-rules-part-2/}}</ref>

===Medical, pharmaceutical and personal care applications===
[[File:Glycerin bottle.jpg|thumb|A bottle of glycerin purchased at a pharmacy]]

Glycerin is mildly antimicrobial and antiviral and is an FDA approved treatment for wounds. The Red Cross reports that an 85% solution of glycerin shows bactericidal and antiviral effects, and wounds treated with glycerin show reduced inflammation after roughly 2 hours. Due to this it is used widely in wound care products, including glycerin based [[Hydrogel dressing|hydrogel]] sheets for burns and other wound care. It is approved for all types of wound care except third degree burns, and is used to package donor skin used in skin grafts. There is no topical treatment approved for third degree burns, and so this limitation is not exclusive to glycerin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stout |first1=Edward I. |last2=McKessor |first2=Angie |title=Glycerin-Based Hydrogel for Infection Control |journal=Advances in Wound Care |date=February 2012 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=48–51 |doi=10.1089/wound.2011.0288 |pmid=24527279 |pmc=3839013 }}</ref>

Glycerol is used in [[medicine|medical]], [[pharmaceutical]] and [[personal care]] preparations, often as a means of improving smoothness, providing [[lubrication]], and as a [[humectant]].

[[Ichthyosis]] and [[xerosis]] have been relieved by the topical use glycerin.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ichthyosis: New Insights for the Healthcare Professional|date=22 July 2013|publisher=[[ScholarlyEditions]]|language=English|isbn=9781481659666|page=22}}</ref><ref name=\"LebwohlHeymann2017\">{{cite book|title=Treatment of Skin Disease E-Book: Comprehensive Therapeutic Strategies|date=19 September 2017|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|language=English|isbn=9780702069130|author=Mark G.

In solid dosage forms like tablets, glycerol is used as a tablet holding agent. For human consumption, glycerol is classified by the U.S. FDA among the [[sugar alcohol]]s as a caloric macronutrient. Glycerol is also used in [[blood banking]] to preserve [[red blood cell]]s prior to freezing.

Glycerol is a component of [[glycerin soap]].<!-- PLEASE DO NOT try to enumerate the ingredients for glycerine soap. There are a million differing recipes, each with its own \"purist\" contingent that swears they are the one true glycerine soapmaker --> [[Essential oil]]s are added for [[fragrance]]. This kind of soap is used by people with sensitive, easily irritated [[skin]] because it prevents skin dryness with its [[moisturizer|moisturizing]] properties. It draws moisture up through skin layers and slows or prevents excessive drying and evaporation.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Taken orally (often mixed with fruit juice to reduce its sweet taste), glycerol can cause a rapid, temporary decrease in the [[Intraocular pressure|internal pressure of the eye]]. This can be useful for the initial emergency treatment of severely elevated eye pressure.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-information/DR601713 |title= Glycerin (Oral Route) |publisher= Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate= 17 November 2012}}</ref>

Glycerol has also been incorporated as a component of [[bio-ink]] formulations in the field of [[3D bioprinting|bioprinting]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Atala|first=Anthony|last2=Yoo|first2=James J.|last3=Carlos Kengla|last4=Ko|first4=In Kap|last5=Lee|first5=Sang Jin|last6=Kang|first6=Hyun-Wook|date=March 2016|title=A 3D bioprinting system to produce human-scale tissue constructs with structural integrity|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=312–319|doi=10.1038/nbt.3413|pmid=26878319|issn=1546-1696}}</ref> The glycerol content acts to add viscosity to the bio-ink without adding large protein, carbohydrate, or glycoprotein molecules.

===Botanical extracts===
When utilized in \"tincture\" method extractions, specifically as a 10% solution, glycerol prevents tannins from precipitating in ethanol extracts of plants ([[tincture]]s). It is also used as an \"alcohol-free\" alternative to ethanol as a solvent in preparing herbal extractions. It is less extractive when utilized in a standard tincture methodology. Alcohol-based tinctures can also have the alcohol removed and replaced with glycerol for its preserving properties. Such products are not \"alcohol-free\" in a scientific sense, as glycerol contains three hydroxyl groups. [[Fluid extract]] manufacturers often extract herbs in hot water before adding glycerol to make [[glycerite]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Long |first1=Walter S. |title=The Composition of Commercial Fruit Extracts |journal=Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science |date=14 January 1916 |volume=28 |pages=157–161 |doi=10.2307/3624347 |jstor=3624347 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.newhope.com/nutritionsciencenews/NSN_backs/Apr_99/backtalk.cfm Does alcohol belong in herbal tinctures?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012040650/http://newhope.com/nutritionsciencenews/NSN_backs/Apr_99/backtalk.cfm |date=12 October 2007 }} newhope.com</ref>

When used as a primary \"true\" alcohol-free botanical extraction solvent in non-tincture based methodologies, glycerol has been shown to possess a high degree of extractive versatility for botanicals including removal of numerous constituents and complex compounds, with an extractive power that can rival that of alcohol and water–alcohol solutions.<ref>https://www.aciscience.org/docs/Glycerine_-_an_overview.pdf{{full citation needed|date=December 2019}}</ref> That glycerol possesses such high extractive power assumes it is utilized with dynamic methodologies as opposed to standard passive \"tincturing\" methodologies that are better suited to alcohol. Glycerol possesses the intrinsic property of not denaturing or rendering a botanical's constituents inert (as alcohols – i.e. ethyl (grain) alcohol, methyl (wood) alcohol, etc., do). Glycerol is a stable preserving agent for botanical extracts that, when utilized in proper concentrations in an extraction solvent base, does not allow inverting or reduction-oxidation of a finished extract's constituents, even over several years.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Both glycerol and ethanol are viable preserving agents.

===Antifreeze===
{{Main|Antifreeze}}
Like [[ethylene glycol]] and [[propylene glycol]], glycerol is a non-ionic [[kosmotropic|kosmotrope]] that forms strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules, competing with water-water [[hydrogen bonds]]. This interaction disrupts the formation of ice. The minimum freezing point temperature is about {{convert|−36|F|C}} corresponding to 70% glycerol in water.

Glycerol was historically used as an anti-freeze for automotive applications before being replaced by [[ethylene glycol]], which has a lower freezing point. While the minimum freezing point of a glycerol-water mixture is higher than an ethylene glycol-water mixture, glycerol is not toxic and is being re-examined for use in automotive applications.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Hudgens |first1= R.

In the laboratory, glycerol is a common component of solvents for [[enzyme|enzymatic]] [[reagents]] stored at temperatures below 0&nbsp;°C due to the [[Freezing-point depression|depression of the freezing temperature]]. It is also used as a [[cryoprotectant]] where the glycerol is dissolved in water to reduce damage by ice crystals to laboratory organisms that are stored in frozen solutions, such as [[bacteria]], [[nematode]]s, and mammalian embryos.

===Chemical intermediate===
Glycerol is used to produce [[nitroglycerin]], which is an essential ingredient of various explosives such as [[dynamite]], [[gelignite]], and propellants like [[cordite]]. Reliance on soap-making to supply co-product glycerol made it difficult to increase production to meet wartime demand. Hence, synthetic glycerol processes were national defense priorities in the days leading up to World War II. Nitroglycerin, also known as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is commonly used to relieve ''[[angina pectoris]]'', taken in the form of [[sub-lingual]] tablets, or as an [[aerosol]] spray.

An oxidation of glycerol affords [[mesoxalic acid]].<ref name=\"ciri2\">

</ref>

===Vibration damping===
Glycerol is used as fill for [[pressure gauge]]s to damp vibration. External vibrations, from compressors, engines, pumps, etc., produce [[harmonic oscillation|harmonic]] vibrations within [[Bourdon gauge]]s that can cause the needle to move excessively, giving inaccurate readings. The excessive swinging of the needle can also damage internal gears or other components, causing premature wear. Glycerol, when poured into a gauge to replace the air space, reduces the harmonic vibrations that are transmitted to the needle, increasing the lifetime and reliability of the gauge.<ref>''Pneumatic Systems: Principles and Maintenance'' by S. R. Majumdar -- McGraw-Hill 2006 Page 74</ref>

Glycerol is used by the film industry when filming scenes involving water to stop areas from drying out too quickly.<ref>[http://www.reagent.co.uk/blog/chemicals-in-film-20th-century-fox-orders-products/ Chemicals in Film]. reagent.co.uk</ref>

Glycerine is used—combined with water (around in a 1:99 proportion)—to create a smooth smoky environment. The solution is vaporized and pushed into the room with a ventilator.

====Ultrasonic couplant====
Glycerol can be sometimes used as replacement for [[water]] in [[ultrasonic testing]], as it has favourably higher [[acoustic impedance]] (2.42MRayl vs 1.483MRayl for [[water]]) while being relatively safe, non-toxic, non-corrosive and relatively low cost.<ref>[https://www.nde-ed.org/GeneralResources/MaterialProperties/UT/ut_matlprop_liquids.htm Acoustic Properties for Liquids]. nde-ed.org</ref>

==Metabolism==
Glycerol is a precursor for synthesis of [[triacylglycerol]]s and of [[phospholipid]]s in the liver and [[adipose tissue]]. When the body uses stored fat as a source of energy, glycerol and [[fatty acid]]s are released into the bloodstream.

Glycerol is mainly metabolized in the liver. Glycerol injections can be used as a simple test for liver damage, as its rate of absorption by the liver is considered an accurate measure of liver health. Glycerol metabolization is reduced in both cirrhosis and fatty liver disease.<ref>Glycerol clearance in alcoholic liver disease. Gut (British Society of Gastroenterology). 1982 Apr; 23(4): 257–264.

September 2018 The Journal of Lipid Research, 59, 1685-1694. Jeffrey D. Browning, Eunsook S. Jin1, Rebecca E. Murphy, and Craig R. Malloy</ref>

Blood Glycerol levels are highly elevated during Diabetes, and is believed to be the cause of reduced fertility in patients who suffer from Diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Blood Glycerol levels in Diabetic patients average three times higher than healthy controls. Direct Glycerol treatment of testes has been found to cause significant long term reduction in sperm count. Further testing on this subject was abandoned due to the unexpected results, as this was not the goal of the experiment.<ref>Molecular Human Reproduction, Volume 23, Issue 11, November 2017, Pages 725–737</ref>

Circulating glycerol does not [[glycate]] proteins as do glucose or fructose, and does not lead to the formation of [[advanced glycation endproduct]]s (AGEs). In some{{which|date=November 2015}} organisms, the glycerol component can enter the glycolysis pathway directly and, thus, provide energy for cellular metabolism (or, potentially, be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis).

Before glycerol can enter the pathway of [[glycolysis]] or [[gluconeogenesis]] (depending on physiological conditions), it must be converted to their intermediate [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]] in the following steps:

A series of destructive [[tornado]]es affected the Southeastern United States on [[Easter Sunday]], April 12, 2020, and Monday, April 13. Several were responsible for prompting [[tornado emergency|tornado emergencies]], including the first one to be issued by the National Weather Service in Charleston.

===Notable tornadoes===
Two strong, long-tracked tornadoes occurred over southern Mississippi. The first occurred between Jackson and Hattiesburg, dealing direct blows or close passes to the towns of [[Bassfield, Mississippi|Bassfield]], [[Seminary, Mississippi|Seminary]], [[Soso, Mississippi|Soso]], and [[Heidelberg, Mississippi|Heidelberg]]. A second tornado followed a similar path from north of Bassfield, close to [[Collins, Mississippi|Collins]], and northeast toward [[Enterprise, Clarke County, Mississippi|Enterprise]]. Tornado emergencies were issued for both tornadoes, with some communities encompassed in both, a rare occurrence potentially not seen since 1999. According to radar, debris lofted by the two tornadoes exceeded {{convert|20,000-30,000|ft|km|abbr=on}} high and may have been carried up to {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} downstream into Alabama. At least 11 fatalities were confirmed, and several homes and businesses were reported damaged or completely destroyed.

===Notable tornadoes===
Two strong, long-tracked tornadoes occurred over southern Mississippi. The first occurred between Jackson and Hattiesburg, dealing direct blows or close passes to the towns of [[Bassfield, Mississippi|Bassfield]], [[Seminary, Mississippi|Seminary]], [[Soso, Mississippi|Soso]], and [[Heidelberg, Mississippi|Heidelberg]]. A second tornado followed a similar path from north of Bassfield, close to [[Collins, Mississippi|Collins]], and northeast toward [[Enterprise, Clarke County, Mississippi|Enterprise]]. Tornado emergencies were issued for both tornadoes, with some communities encompassed in both, a rare occurrence potentially not seen since 1999. According to radar, debris lofted by the two tornadoes exceeded {{convert|20,000-30,000|ft|km|abbr=on}} high and may have been carried up to {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} downstream into Alabama. At least 11 fatalities were confirmed, and several homes and businesses were reported damaged or completely destroyed. As the line of storms progressed east, another significant tornado affected [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], prompting yet another tornado emergency.<ref name=\"wapoupdates\">{{cite news|author=Matthew Cappucci|author2=Andrew Freeman|author3=Jason Samenow|title=13 Dead as Tornadoes, Storms Tear Through Southern States|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/04/13/tornado-severe-weather-east-coast/|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=April 13, 2020|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> The tornado killed two people,<ref name=\"tn\" /> including one man who died when a tree fell onto his home; numerous other people were treated for injuries at local hospitals.<ref>{{cite web|title=1 killed, dozens injured, 150 homes & businesses damaged after tornado, powerful storms stuck Chattanooga|url=https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/chattanooga-area-officials-several-people-taken-to-hospital-after-storms-one-missing/51-e60d1877-aeba-4100-8feb-b25b6f3584b8|publisher=WBIR|date=April 13, 2020|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> It has been rated EF3 intensity.<ref name=\"EastChatupdate\"/> A pre-dawn tornado in [[Murray County, Georgia]], killed seven people and inflicted injuries to at least 23 others as it hit a number of mobile homes.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"War zone:\" At least 7 dead in Murray County from Sunday's storms, at least 23 injured|url=https://newschannel9.com/news/local/murray-county-ema-at-least-5-dead-from-sundays-storms-several-injured|publisher=WTVC|date=April 13, 2020|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> A man in [[Cartersville, Georgia]], was also killed when a tree fell through his home.<ref>{{cite web|author=Marc Teichner|author2=Natalie Fultz|author3=Emilie Ikeda|author4=Colin Lawler|title=At least 6 dead, dozens injured after severe storms rip through Georgia overnight|url=https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/at-least-6-dead-dozens-injured-after-severe-storms-rip-through-georgia-overnight|publisher=Fox 5 Atlanta|date=April 13, 2020|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> One tornado in [[Seneca, South Carolina]], killed one person.
