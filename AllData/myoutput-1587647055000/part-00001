It is part of a public, coeducational school (preprimary-12), [[National Experimental High School]] (NEHS). Founded in August 1983, the school was proposed by the founder of the Science Park [[Kwoh-Ting Li]] and administered by Ministry of Education, [[National Science Council]] and administration of the Park. Originally IBSH was formed to attract high-tech talent and technologies to move to Hsinchu Science park, but the Ministry of Education won't allow the creation of a school based solely for oversea workers. Thus, NEHS was created to satisfy the conditions set by the Ministry of Education. IBSH only admits children of employees of private enterprises in the Park, government organizations, [[Industrial Technology Research Institute]], [[National Chiao Tung University]] and [[National Tsing Hua University]].\n\nThe Bilingual Department of NEHS changed its name before the 2008-2009 school year after a visit from the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] in the spring of 2008. In summer 2011, IBSH was granted WASC accreditation. It serves students in the English-speaking community who seek an American college-preparatory education or plan to transfer into the local school system.\n\n==Student body==\nThe Bilingual Department had at least 700 students from Grades 1-12 enrolled for the 2008-2009 school year. Over half of these students were U.S. citizens. Students come from business, professional, government, and diplomatic families. 41% of IBSH parents have a PhD.\n\nEach grade is split up into two classes, A and B, each with its own homeroom teacher. 39 of the 61 certified full-time teachers have master's degrees and two have PhDs. 38 of the teachers are East Asian, 18 are American, and 5 are Canadian. The faculty-to-student ratio is 1:20.\n\n==Academics==\nStudents are put through a challenging curriculum that follows an American high school format, albeit with mandatory Chinese classes. Many go on to attend prestigious institutions such as [[Rice University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Harvard University]], [[Columbia University]], [[Yale University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Duke University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Northwestern University]], and [[University of Chicago]]. Honor courses offered include Math (9-12), English (9-12), World History (10), and many [[Advanced Placement]] courses. AP courses offered at IBSH include Studio Art, Biology, Chemistry, Calculus AB/BC, Chinese Language and Culture, Computer Science, English Literature and Composition, Environmental Science, European History, Micro/Macroeconomics, Physics 1, Physics C, Psychology, Statistics, US History, US Government and Politics, and European History. In May 2008, 195 students took a total of 325 AP tests. 41.5% scored a 5, 18.8% a 4, 16.9% a 3, 8.9% a 2, and 13.8% a 1, with an average score of 3.625.\n\nThe class of 2009 had 51 students. Up to September 2008, these students scored an average of 639V, 699M, and 654W (combined average of 1992) on the [[SAT]], well above the U.S. national average. Six members of the class of 2018 have been named Finalists in the [[National Merit Scholarship Program]].\n\n==Extracurriculars==\nWhile students must keep up with the rigorous course load, there are also many active clubs, such as A Cappella, Student Government (BDSC), Circuit Breaking Crew ([[breakdancing]]), ShutterLensLight (photography), D.Co (Dance Company), Debate, Drama Club, Fellowship, Humane Society, GIN, InterAct, [[Key Club]], Panthers Newspaper Club, CinemaScope (film club), and [[Yearbook]]. Many students are involved with [[Model United Nations]], and the school hosts Taiwan's only THIMUN affiliated conference [[HSINMUN]] <ref>{{cite web |title=HSINMUN XIV |url=https://www.hsinmunibsh.org |website=HSINMUN IBSH |publisher=HSINMUN Secretariat}}</ref>. Students also attend [[TAIMUN]], PASMUN, TASMUN, HIMUN, NEMUN, STMUN, and [[THIMUN-Singapore]] conferences.\n\nThere are athletic teams grades 7-12 students may join. These teams play year-round and hold practices after school. Current teams include Badminton Team, [[Basketball]] team (Boys/Girls), Boys soccer team, , the NEHS [[Cheerleading]] squad (co-ed), and most importantly, the NEHS Baseball Team. These teams have won games and tournaments at the city and county level.\n\nIBSH holds a friendly rivalry with the Junior High and Senior High Departments of NEHS, especially during Field Day, an all-school track and field competition held in early November.\n\nStudents host dances, concerts, and other events such as the back-to-school event (co-hosted by BDSC, InterAct, and Key Club), Beat Concert (co-hosted by InterAct and EDSC), the casual dance (hosted by BDSC), Charity Night (co-hosted by InterAct and Key Club), the semi-formal dance (hosted by BDSC), Prom (hosted by the junior class), TEDxYouth@IBSH, GLO Night: Club Central (hosted by the Global Leadership Organization), and Unplugged (hosted by Key Club).\n\n==See also==\n* [[National Experimental High School]]\n* [[Hsinchu American School]]\n* [[Taipei American School]]\n* [[Dominican International School]]\n* [[Morrison Academy]]\n* [[Kaohsiung American School]]\n* [[American School in Taichung]]\n* [[Pacific American School]]\n* [[Hsinchu Science Park]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ibsh.tw  International Bilingual School At Hsinchu Science Park]\n\n{{coord missing|Taiwan}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:International Bilingual School At Hsinchu Science Park}}\n[[Category:1983 establishments in Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1983]]\n[[Category:Experimental schools]]\n[[Category:High schools in Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Schools in Hsinchu]]\n\n[[ja:\u56fd\u7acb\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u696d\u5712\u533a\u5b9f\u9a13\u9ad8\u7d1a\u4e2d\u5b66]]\n[[zh:\u570b\u7acb\u79d1\u5b78\u5de5\u696d\u5712\u5340\u5be6\u9a57\u9ad8\u7d1a\u4e2d\u5b78]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Original research|date=April 2013}}\n{{More references|date=July 2018}}\n}}\n{{Infobox school\n| name = International Bilingual School at Hsinchu Science Park\n| native_name = \u570b\u7acb\u79d1\u5b78\u5de5\u696d\u5712\u5340\u5be6\u9a57\u9ad8\u7d1a\u4e2d\u5b78\u96d9\u8a9e\u90e8\n| image = \n| motto = \u8aa0\u61c7\u3001\u8e0f\u5be6\u3001\u5275\u65b0\u3001\u8d85\u8d8a\n| motto_translation = Sincere, Steadfast, Innovative, Transcending\n| established = {{Start date and age|1983}}\n| type = [[Nation]]al [[High School]], [[elementary school]]\n| principal = Roger Lee\n| address = No.300, Jie-Shou Road\n| city = [[Hsinchu City]]\n| country = [[Taiwan]]\n| SAT_year = 2018\n| SAT = 1450\n| website = {{URL|www.ibsh.tw}} {{in lang|en}}\n}}\n\nThe '''International Bilingual School at Hsinchu Science Park''' ('''IBSH'''; {{zh|c=\u570b\u7acb\u79d1\u5b78\u5de5\u696d\u5712\u5340\u5be6\u9a57\u9ad8\u7d1a\u4e2d\u5b78\u96d9\u8a9e\u90e8}}), formerly known as '''Bilingual Department of National Experimental High School At Science Based Industrial Park''', is near the [[Hsinchu Science Park]].
