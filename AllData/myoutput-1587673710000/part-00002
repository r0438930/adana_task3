[[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama]] buys [[Uncle Fester|Fester]] time to evacuate Gomez, Morticia, and [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]]. Gomez and Morticia decide to move to [[New Jersey]], a place \"no one would be caught dead in.\" There, Gomez, Morticia, and Thing find their \"perfect\" home in an abandoned asylum on a hill. They meet [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], an escaped mental patient whom they hit when Thing was distracted driving the car, and immediately recruit him as their butler.\n\nThirteen years later, the Addams family continue to live their gloomy lives in isolation from the outside world. Gomez prepares his son [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]] for his upcoming [[Mazurka]], a rite of passage that every Addams family member takes. Morticia struggles to keep their daughter, [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]], from wanting to experience the world outside of the mansion after a balloon and confetti appear on their property, as the fog surrounding it begins to lift.\n\nElsewhere, reality TV host Margaux Needler, who is building a perfect [[planned community]] called \"Assimilation\" so her show will have a successful season finale, discovers the Addams family's household and becomes determined to rid the town of it when the family refuses to change. Wednesday then meets Margaux's neglected daughter Parker and convinces Morticia to let her attend junior high school. Pugsley struggles with the complicated traditions and pressure of his Mazurka, even with the guidance of Gomez and Uncle Fester. Grandmama arrives at the house for the event.\n\nAt school, Wednesday defends Parker and her twin friends Layla and Kayla from the school bully named Bethany and befriends them after she resurrects some [[dissection|dead frogs]] and commands them to attack Bethany. Later on, the two discuss their frustrations and change their dressing habits \u2013 Parker becomes more [[Goth subculture|gothic]] and Wednesday dresses more colorfully \u2013 to the shock of both of their mothers. After an argument with Morticia, Wednesday decides to run away in secret and stay with Parker for a while, which Pugsley inadvertently tells Morticia.\n\nWednesday and Parker discover a secret room under Parker's house revealing that Margaux has planted hidden cameras in every house she designed in town and has been spreading rumors about the Addams family through social media, claiming that they are freaks. Margaux catches the two and locks them in the attic, but Wednesday breaks them out. Margaux rallies an angry mob to attack the mansion just as [[Cousin Itt]] and the entire Addams clan arrive for Pugsley's Mazurka.\n\nDuring the Mazurka, Pugsley fails miserably in front of the whole family, but Gomez reassures him that he is an Addams nonetheless. The mob arrives flinging boulders, severely damaging the mansion and trapping the family inside. Pugsley uses his love of bombs and destruction to defend his family and manages to destroy the mob's [[trebuchet]]. Wednesday and Parker join in and help everyone out of the wreckage safely with help of the living tree Ichabod.\n\nAs Margaux tries to take control once more, her treachery is revealed by Parker. They see that the Addams are not monsters, but a family, and Wednesday states that everyone is weird in their own unique way. Margaux's agent Glenn carries a message from the network stating that her show is now cancelled because Parker was live streaming the whole thing with her phone. As Fester comes up with a compromise to Margaux, Assimilation's civilians realize the error of their ways.\n\nAfter they work together to rebuild the mansion, the Addams family and Assimilation's civilians live in peace. Margaux becomes Fester's business partner selling homes to the other members of the Addams clan. Pugsley completes his Mazurka.\n\n==Cast== \n* [[Oscar Isaac]] as [[Gomez Addams]], Morticia's husband.\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as [[Morticia Addams|Morticia Addams (n\u00e9e Frump)]], Gomez's wife.\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as [[Wednesday Addams]], Gomez and Morticia's daughter.\n* [[Finn Wolfhard]] as [[Pugsley Addams]], Gomez and Morticia's son.\n* [[Nick Kroll]] as [[Uncle Fester]], Gomez's brother.\n* [[Bette Midler]] as [[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama Addams]], Gomez and Fester's mother\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as:\n** [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], the Addams Family's butler.\n** An unnamed [[priest]] that presides over Gomez and Morticia's wedding and is one of their relatives.\n** The spirit that haunts the abandoned asylum that Gomez and Morticia move into.\n** Dr. Flambe, a [[devil]]-like relative of the Addams family whose head can light on fire.\n* [[Snoop Dogg]] as [[Cousin Itt]], Gomez and Fester's hairy cousin.\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Margaux Needler, a sly and greedy reality TV show host and homemaking [[guru]].\n* [[Martin Short]] as Grandpa Frump, Morticia's late father who Morticia contacts through a [[s\u00e9ance]].\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Grandma Frump, Morticia's late mother who Morticia contacts through a s\u00e9ance.\n* [[Tituss Burgess]] as Glenn, Margaux's agent.\n* [[Jenifer Lewis]] as Great Auntie Sloom, Grandmama's sister with a missing left eye and has stilts under her dress.\n* [[Elsie Fisher]] as Parker Needler, Margaux's neglected and rebellious daughter who befriends Wednesday.\n* [[Aimee Garcia]] as Denise, a camera operator who works for Margaux.\n* [[Scott Underwood]] as Mitch, a member of Margaux's film crew.\n* [[Mikey Madison]] as Candi, a [[barista]].\n* Chelsea Frei as Bethany, a girl who picks on Parker.\n* [[Pom Klementieff]] as Layla and Kayla, twin girls who are Parker's friends.\n* [[Deven Green]] as Ms. Gravely, a teacher at Parker's school.\n* [[Maggie Wheeler]] as Trudy Pickering, an inhabitant of Assimilation.\n* [[Harland Williams]] as:\n** Norman Pickering, the husband of Trudy.\n** Ggerri\n\n==Production==\nIn 2010, after [[Illumination (company)|Illumination Entertainment]] acquired the rights to ''The Addams Family'' comics, they began work on the film at [[Universal Pictures]] as a [[stop-motion]] animation directed by [[Tim Burton]] and produced by [[Chris Meledandri]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2010/03/tim-burton-next-3d-animated-film-da-da-da-snap-snap-the-addams-family-28841/|title=Tim Burton's Next 3D Animated Film?

[[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama]] buys [[Uncle Fester|Fester]] time to evacuate Gomez, Morticia, and [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]]. Gomez and Morticia decide to move to [[New Jersey]], a place \"no one would be caught dead in.\" There, Gomez, Morticia, and Thing find their \"perfect\" home in an abandoned asylum on a hill. They meet [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], an escaped mental patient whom they hit when Thing was distracted driving the car, and immediately recruit him as their butler.\n\nThirteen years later, the Addams family continue to live their gloomy lives in isolation from the outside world. Gomez prepares his son [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]] for his upcoming [[Mazurka]], a rite of passage that every Addams family member takes. Morticia struggles to keep their daughter, [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]], from wanting to experience the world outside of the mansion after a balloon and confetti appear on their property, as the fog surrounding it begins to lift.\n\nElsewhere, reality TV host Margaux Needler, who is building a perfect [[planned community]] called \"Assimilation\" so her show will have a successful season finale, discovers the Addams family's household and becomes determined to rid the town of it when the family refuses to change. Wednesday then meets Margaux's neglected daughter Parker and convinces Morticia to let her attend junior high school. Pugsley struggles with the complicated traditions and pressure of his Mazurka, even with the guidance of Gomez and Uncle Fester. Grandmama arrives at the house for the event.\n\nAt school, Wednesday defends Parker and her twin friends Layla and Kayla from the school bully named Bethany and befriends them after she resurrects some [[dissection|dead frogs]] and commands them to attack Bethany. Later on, the two discuss their frustrations and change their dressing habits \u2013 Parker becomes more [[Goth subculture|gothic]] and Wednesday dresses more colorfully \u2013 to the shock of both of their mothers. After an argument with Morticia, Wednesday decides to run away in secret and stay with Parker for a while, which Pugsley inadvertently tells Morticia.\n\nWednesday and Parker discover a secret room under Parker's house revealing that Margaux has planted hidden cameras in every house she designed in town and has been spreading rumors about the Addams family through social media, claiming that they are freaks. Margaux catches the two and locks them in the attic, but Wednesday breaks them out. Margaux rallies an angry mob to attack the mansion just as [[Cousin Itt]] and the entire Addams clan arrive for Pugsley's Mazurka.\n\nDuring the Mazurka, Pugsley fails miserably in front of the whole family, but Gomez reassures him that he is an Addams nonetheless. The mob arrives flinging boulders, severely damaging the mansion and trapping the family inside. Pugsley uses his love of bombs and destruction to defend his family and manages to destroy the mob's [[trebuchet]]. Wednesday and Parker join in and help everyone out of the wreckage safely with help of the living tree Ichabod.\n\nAs Margaux tries to take control once more, her treachery is revealed by Parker. They see that the Addams are not monsters, but a family, and Wednesday states that everyone is weird in their own unique way. Margaux's agent Glenn carries a message from the network stating that her show is now cancelled because Parker was live streaming the whole thing with her phone. As Fester comes up with a compromise to Margaux, Assimilation's civilians realize the error of their ways.\n\nAfter they work together to rebuild the mansion, the Addams family and Assimilation's civilians live in peace. Margaux becomes Fester's business partner selling homes to the other members of the Addams clan. Pugsley completes his Mazurka.\n\n==Cast== \n* [[Oscar Isaac]] as [[Gomez Addams]], Morticia's husband.\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as [[Morticia Addams|Morticia Addams (n\u00e9e Frump)]], Gomez's wife.\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as [[Wednesday Addams]], Gomez and Morticia's daughter.\n* [[Finn Wolfhard]] as [[Pugsley Addams]], Gomez and Morticia's son.\n* [[Nick Kroll]] as [[Uncle Fester]], Gomez's brother.\n* [[Bette Midler]] as [[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama Addams]], Gomez and Fester's mother\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as:\n** [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], the Addams Family's butler.\n** An unnamed [[priest]] that presides over Gomez and Morticia's wedding and is one of their relatives.\n** The spirit that haunts the abandoned asylum that Gomez and Morticia move into.\n** Dr. Flambe, a [[devil]]-like relative of the Addams family whose head can light on fire.\n* [[Snoop Dogg]] as [[Cousin Itt]], Gomez and Fester's hairy cousin.\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Margaux Needler, a sly and greedy reality TV show host and homemaking [[guru]].\n* [[Martin Short]] as Grandpa Frump, Morticia's late father who Morticia contacts through a [[s\u00e9ance]].\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Grandma Frump, Morticia's late mother who Morticia contacts through a s\u00e9ance.\n* [[Tituss Burgess]] as Glenn, Margaux's agent.\n* [[Jenifer Lewis]] as Great Auntie Sloom, Grandmama's sister with a missing left eye and has stilts under her dress.\n* [[Elsie Fisher]] as Parker Needler, Margaux's neglected and rebellious daughter who befriends Wednesday.\n* [[Aimee Garcia]] as Denise, a camera operator who works for Margaux.\n* [[Scott Underwood]] as Mitch, a member of Margaux's film crew.\n* [[Mikey Madison]] as Candi, a [[barista]].\n* Chelsea Frei as Bethany, a girl who picks on Parker.\n* [[Pom Klementieff]] as Layla and Kayla, twin girls who are Parker's friends.\n* [[Deven Green]] as Ms. Gravely, a teacher at Parker's school.\n* [[Maggie Wheeler]] as Trudy Pickering, an inhabitant of Assimilation.\n* [[Harland Williams]] as:\n** Norman Pickering, the husband of Trudy.\n** Ggerri\n\n==Production==\nIn 2010, after [[Illumination (company)|Illumination Entertainment]] acquired the rights to ''The Addams Family'' comics, they began work on the film at [[Universal Pictures]] as a [[stop-motion]] animation directed by [[Tim Burton]] and produced by [[Chris Meledandri]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2010/03/tim-burton-next-3d-animated-film-da-da-da-snap-snap-the-addams-family-28841/|title=Tim Burton's Next 3D Animated Film?
