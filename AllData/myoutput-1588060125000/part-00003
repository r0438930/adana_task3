{{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100|commas=on|CH|PC|FRCP}} (born 2 July 1938) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] politician and [[physician]].\n\nOwen served as British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 1977 to 1979, at the age of 38 the youngest person in over forty years to hold the post. In 1981, Owen was one of the \"[[Gang of Four (SDP)|Gang of Four]]\" who left the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] to found the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP). Owen led the SDP from 1983 to 1987, and the [[Social Democratic Party (UK, 1988)|continuing SDP]] from 1988 to 1990. Appointed as a [[life peer]] in 1992, he sat in the [[House of Lords]] as a [[crossbencher]] until March 2014, and now sits as an \"independent social democrat\".<ref name=\"NSMarch2014\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/03/david-owen-joins-milibands-big-tent-donation-labour-more-%C2%A37500|title=David Owen joins Miliband's big tent with donation to Labour of more than \u00a37,500 |first=George |last=Eaton |work=New Statesman|date=2 March 2014|accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of his career, Owen has held, and resigned from, a number of senior posts. He first quit as Labour's spokesman on defence in 1972 in protest at the Labour leader [[Harold Wilson]]'s attitude to the [[European Community|EEC]]; he left the Labour [[Shadow cabinet]] over the same issue later; and over [[unilateral disarmament]] in November 1980 when [[Michael Foot]] became Labour leader. He resigned from the Labour Party when it rejected [[one member, one vote]] in February 1981 and later as Leader of the Social Democratic Party, which he had helped to found, after the party's rank-and-file membership voted to merge with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].\n\n==Early life==\nOwen was born in 1938 to [[Welsh people|Welsh]] parents in [[Plympton]], near the city of [[Plymouth]], in [[Devon]], England.<ref name = \"Harris1\">{{harvnb|Harris|1988|p=1}}</ref> He also has Swiss and Irish ancestry.<ref name = \"Harris1\"/> After schooling at Mount House School, [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]], and [[Bradfield College]], Berkshire,<ref>{{harvnb|Harris|1988|p=7}}</ref> he was admitted to [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]] in 1956 to study Medicine, and obtained a [[2:2]];  he was made an Honorary Fellow of the college in 1977. He began clinical training at [[St Thomas's Hospital]] in October 1959.\n\nOwen was deeply affected by the [[Suez crisis]] of 1956, when [[Anthony Eden]]'s Conservative government launched a military operation to retrieve the Suez Canal after [[Nasser]]'s decision to nationalise it. At the time, aged 18, he was working on a labouring job before going to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. Owen later told [[Kenneth Harris (journalist)|Kenneth Harris]]:\n\n<blockquote>[T]here was [[Hugh Gaitskell|Gaitskell]]...criticizing Eden, and here were these men working alongside me, who should have been his natural supporters, furious with him. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' backed Gaitskell, but these men were tearing up their ''Daily Mirror''s every day. ... My working mates were solidly in favour of Eden. It was not only that they taught me how people like them think; they also opened my eyes to how I should think myself. From then on I never identified with the liberal \u2013 with a small 'l' \u2013 establishment. Through that experience I became suspicious of a kind of automatic sogginess which you come across in many aspects of British life. ... The rather defeatist, even traitorous attitude reflected in the pre-war Apostles at Cambridge. I suppose it underlay the appeasement years. Its modern equivalent is a resigned attitude to Britain's continuous post-war economic decline.<ref>{{harvnb|Harris|1988|p=17}}</ref><ref>David Marquand, ''The Progressive Dilemma: From Lloyd George to Blair'' (London: Phoenix, 1999), p. 203.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Medicine and politics==\nIn 1960, Owen joined the [[Vauxhall]] branch of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Fabian Society]]. He qualified as a doctor in 1962 and began work at St Thomas's Hospital. In 1964, he contested the [[Torrington (UK Parliament constituency)|Torrington]] seat as the Labour candidate against the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] incumbent, losing in what was a traditional Conservative-[[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Constituency|marginal]]. He was [[neurology]] and psychiatric [[Specialist registrar|registrar]] at St Thomas's Hospital for two years, as assistant to Dr. [[William Sargant]], then Research Fellow on the Medical Unit doing research into Parkinsonian trauma and neuropharmacology.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nAt the next [[1966 United Kingdom general election|general election, in 1966]], Owen returned to his home town and was elected Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for the [[Plymouth Sutton (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Sutton]] [[constituency]]. In the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] Owen became Labour MP for the adjacent [[Plymouth Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Devonport]] constituency, winning it from the Conservative incumbent [[Dame (title)|Dame]] [[Joan Vickers]] by a slim margin (437 votes). He managed to hold on to it in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], again by a narrow margin (1001 votes). From 1981, however, his involvement with the SDP meant he developed a large personal following in the constituency and thereafter he was re-elected as an SDP candidate with safe margins. He remained as MP for Plymouth Devonport until his elevation to a [[peerage]] in 1992.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1970, Owen served as [[Parliamentary Under Secretary of State]] for the [[Royal Navy|Navy]] in [[Harold Wilson]]'s first government. After Labour's defeat in the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]], he became the party's Junior Defence Spokesman until 1972 when he resigned with [[Roy Jenkins]] over Labour's opposition to the European Community. On Labour's return to government in March 1974, he became Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health before being promoted to Minister of State for [[Department of Health (UK)|Health]] in July 1974.\n\n==In Government==\nAs Minister of State for Health he encouraged Britain to become \"self-sufficient\" in blood products such as [[Factor VIII]], a recommendation also promoted by the World Health Organisation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/finalreport/pdf/PEN0131125.PDF |title=Final report|work=Penrose inquiry}}</ref> This was principally due to the risk of Hepatitis infection from high-risk blood donors overseas who were often paid and from \"skid-row\" locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARkDcNL8ozU&t=1388s|title=World In Action - Blood Money Part 2 - December 1975|date=2 January 2013|publisher=CampaignTB|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqt0xXz-saw|title=Lord David Owen - Bad Blood Speech 29/9/16|date=30 September 2016|publisher=Factor8Scandal|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Haemophiliac HIV tragedy \u2032needless\u2032 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1470755.stm |work=BBC News|location=London |date=3 August 2001 |access-date=2020-04-20|quote= ''Lord Owen, Secretary of State for Health in 1975, claimed the Department of Health failed to spend money allocated to stop the import of blood and blood products from abroad.

Five months later, however, the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Anthony Crosland]], died suddenly and Owen was appointed his successor. Aged 38, he became the youngest Foreign Secretary since [[Anthony Eden]] in 1935.\n\nAs Foreign Secretary, Owen was identified with the Anglo-American plan for [[Rhodesia]], which formed the basis for the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], negotiated by his Tory successor, [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]], in December 1979. The Contact Group sponsored [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 435|UN Resolution 435]] in 1978 on which Namibia moved to independence twelve years later. He wrote a book entitled ''Human Rights'' and championed that cause in Africa and in the Soviet Union. He has admitted to at one stage contemplating the assassination of [[Idi Amin]] while Foreign Secretary but settled instead to backing with money for arms purchases to [[Julius Nyerere|President Nyerere]] of [[Tanzania]] in his armed attack on [[Uganda]] which led to the exile of Amin to [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nShortly after Labour's defeat in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 General Election]] and following the [[1979 Labour Party (UK) Shadow Cabinet election|election of a new Shadow Cabinet]] Callaghan moved Owen from the position of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Shadow Foreign Secretary]] to [[Shadow Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change|Shadow Energy Secretary]], a move which was reported as being a demotion.<ref name=\"GH15061979\">{{cite news |last1=Parkhouse |first1=Geoffrey |title=Shore steps up as Owen is demoted |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19790615&printsec=frontpage&hl=en |accessdate=8 January 2019 |work=Glasgow Herald |date=15 June 1979|via=Google News}}</ref>\n\n18 months after Labour lost power, the staunchly left-wing politician [[Michael Foot]] was elected party leader, despite vocal opposition from Labour Party moderates (including Owen), sparking a crisis over the party's future.\n\n==Social Democratic Party and Liberal-SDP Alliance==\n[[File:Dr David Owen, 1981.jpg|thumb|left|Owen speaking in 1981]]\n[[Michael Foot]]'s election as Labour party leader indicated that the party was likely to become more left-wing, and in 1980 committed itself to withdrawing from the EEC without even a referendum (as Labour had carried out in 1975). Labour also endorsed unilateral nuclear disarmament and introduced an electoral college for leadership elections, with 40% of the college going to a block vote of the trade unions.\n\nEarly in 1981, Owen and three other senior moderate Labour politicians \u2013 [[Roy Jenkins]], [[Bill Rodgers (politician)|Bill Rodgers]] and [[Shirley Williams]] \u2013 announced their intention to break away from the Labour Party to form a \"Council for Social Democracy\". The announcement became known as the [[Limehouse Declaration]] and the four as the \"[[Social Democratic Party (UK)#Creation of the SDP|Gang of Four]]\". The council they formed became the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP), with a collective leadership.<ref name=\"ChildsStorry2013\">{{cite book|author1=Peter Childs|author2=Michael Storry|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlsKXeRt0wgC&pg=PA485|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-134-75555-4|page=485|via=Google Books}}</ref> Although Owen was one of the founding members of the party, he was not always enthusiastic about creating a [[schism]] on the [[centre-left]], saying to the ''[[Glasgow Herald]]'' in January 1981 that he felt \"haunted by the possibility that, if the Labour Party splits, the centre left will never again form the Government in Britain\".<ref>{{cite news|title=The Gang of Three hold talks|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CbZAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HqYMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2855%2C2895895|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=Glasgow Herald|date=19 January 1981|page=1|via=Google News}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-eight other Labour MPs and one Conservative MP ([[Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler]]) joined the new party. In late 1981, the SDP formed the [[SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] to strengthen both parties' chances in the UK's \"[[Plurality voting system|first past the post]]\" electoral system. The alliance performed so well that for much of the early part of 1982, it appeared that it would become a centre-left coalition government at the next election. In 1982, uneasy about the Alliance, Owen challenged Jenkins for the leadership of the SDP, but was defeated by 26,256 votes to 20,864. In the following year's [[1983 United Kingdom general election|General Election]], the Alliance gained 25% of the vote, only slightly behind the Labour Party, but because of the [[first-past-the-post voting system]], it won only 23 out of 650 seats. Although elected, Jenkins resigned the SDP leadership and Owen succeeded to it without a contest among the six remaining SDP MPs.\n\nIn 1982, during the [[Falklands War]], Owen spoke at the [[Bilderberg Meeting|Bilderberg Group]] advocating sanctions against Argentina.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4149485,00.html|title=Who pulls the strings?

I'm sure that various foreign ministers went back to their respective countries and told their leaders what David Owen had said. And you know what? Sanctions were imposed\"}}</ref> Ironically, the success of the war ended any hope that SDP might have had of winning the 1983 election. The Tories were proving unpopular largely due to high unemployment and the [[early 1980s recession]], while Labour's [[democratic socialism|democratic-socialist]] policies were driving away moderate voters. However, Britain's success in the conflict saw [[Margaret Thatcher]] and her Tory government surge back to the top of the opinion polls, and her position was strengthened further by the end of the year as the recession ended and more voters had faith in her economic policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1983_over.stm|title=1983: Maggie's Landslide|work=Election Battles 1945\u20131997|publisher=BBC News|year=2001|accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===SDP leadership===\nOwen is widely regarded as having been, at the very least, a competent party leader. He had high popularity ratings throughout his leadership as did the SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance. He succeeded in keeping the party in the public eye and in maintaining its independence from the Liberals for the length of the 1983 Parliament. Moreover, under him, the SDP increased its representation from six to eight seats via the by-election victories of [[Mike Hancock (UK politician)|Mike Hancock]], at [[1984 Portsmouth South by-election|Portsmouth South]] (1984), and [[Rosie Barnes]], at [[1987 Greenwich by-election|Greenwich]] (1987).\n\nHowever, the progress of the SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance as a whole was hampered, with policy splits between the two parties. The first was over the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|miners' strike of 1984\u201385]], with Owen and most of the SDP favouring a fairly tough line but the Liberals preferring compromise and negotiation. More significantly the Alliance had a dispute over the future of Britain's independent nuclear deterrent. Owen and the SDP favoured replacing [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] with [[Trident (missile)|Trident]] as a matter of some importance, whereas most Liberals were either indifferent to the issue or committed disarmers. The SDP favoured a radical [[social market economy]], while the Liberals mostly favoured a more interventionist, [[Corporatism|corporate]] style approach. The cumulative effect of these divisions was to make the Alliance appear less credible as a potential government in the eyes of the electorate.\n\nMoreover, Owen, unlike Jenkins, faced an increasingly moderate Labour Party under [[Neil Kinnock]] and a dynamic Conservative government. The [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] was as disappointing for the Alliance as the 1983 election and it lost one seat. Nevertheless, it won over 23% of the vote \u2013 at that time, the second-largest third-placed vote in British politics since 1929.\n\n=== Full parties' merger ===\nIn 1987 immediately after the election, the Liberal leader [[David Steel]] proposed a full merger of the Liberal and SDP parties and was supported for the SDP by Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams and Bill Rodgers. Owen rejected this notion outright, on the grounds that he and other Social Democrats wished to remain faithful to [[social democracy]] as it was practised within Western Europe, and it was unlikely that any merged party would be able to do this, even if it was under his leadership. Nevertheless, the majority of the SDP membership supported the merger.\n\nThe Liberal Party and SDP merged to form the Social and Liberal Democrats (SLD) in March 1988, renamed the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in October 1989.\n\nAt the request of two of the remaining SDP MPs, [[John Cartwright (UK politician)|John Cartwright]] and [[Rosie Barnes]], Owen continued to lead a much smaller [[Social Democratic Party (UK, 1988)|continuing SDP]], with three MPs in total. The party polled well at its first election, its candidate coming a close second in the 1989 [[1989 Richmond (Yorks) by-election|Richmond by-election]], but thereafter a string of poor and ultimately disastrous by-election results followed, including coming behind the [[Official Monster Raving Loony Party]] in the [[May 1990 Bootle by-election|Bootle by-election]] of May 1990, prompting Owen to wind up the party in 1990. Owen blamed the SDP's demise on the reforms which had been taking place in the Labour Party since Kinnock's election as leader in 1983.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1136223.stm | work=BBC News | title=SDP: Breaking the mould | date=25 January 2001}}</ref>\n\nSome branches, however, continued to function using the [[Social Democratic Party (UK, 1990)|SDP name]]; [[Bridlington]]'s was still extant in 2006.\n\n[[Richard Holme, Baron Holme of Cheltenham|Lord Holme]] later blamed Owen for the Alliance's failure to make a breakthrough at the 1987 general election, believing that a merged party would have performed much better and possibly gained more votes and seats than Labour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epolitix.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/top-ten-lib-dem-breakthrough-moments/ |title=Top Ten: Lib Dem 'breakthrough moments' |publisher=ePolitix.com |date=24 April 2010 |accessdate=19 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512171830/http://www.epolitix.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/top-ten-lib-dem-breakthrough-moments/ |archivedate=12 May 2010  }}</ref>\n\n===Political allegiances as a life peer===\nAfter winding up the re-formed SDP, Owen announced his intention to stand down as an MP at the next General Election. He then served the remainder of his term as an independent MP and after the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 General Election]] was made a [[life peer]], nominated by then Conservative Prime Minister, [[John Major]], with the title \"'''Baron Owen''', of the City of [[Plymouth]]\",<ref>{{London Gazette\n| issue = 52981\n| date = 3 July 1992\n|page=11255\n}}</ref> in [[Letters Patent]] dated 30 June 1992. As a member of the [[House of Lords]], he is called \"Lord Owen\" and he sat as a [[crossbencher]] until 2014 (see below). Owen was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from [[Plymouth University]] in 1992.\n\nDuring the April 1992 election campaign, Owen writing in ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' newspaper advised voters to vote Liberal Democrat where they had a chance of victory and to vote Conservative rather than let Neil Kinnock become Prime Minister. Owen maintained his long-standing position that he would never join the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], although the memoirs of at least three of [[John Major]]'s cabinet ministers refer to Major being quite keen to appoint Owen to his cabinet, but threats of resignation from within the Cabinet prevented him from doing so. When asked in a conversation with [[Woodrow Wyatt]] on 18 December 1988 whether she would have Owen in her government if approached by him, [[Margaret Thatcher]] replied: \"Well, not straight away.

In October 2009 he wrote an article in ''[[The Times]]'' predicting that the Conservatives, then well ahead in the opinion polls, were unlikely to win an outright majority. He helped create the web-based Charter 2010 to explain and promote the potential of a [[hung parliament]]. The website campaign was launched in January 2010 while the Conservatives still appeared on course to win outright. Within weeks the polls changed and the website became a major source of information about hung parliaments. In May 2010 ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' called Owen \"the prophet of the coalition\".\n\nDuring the [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum|2011 Alternative Vote referendum]] he signed a letter in ''[[The Guardian]]'' stating that he opposed AV but would continue to campaign for proportional representation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/mar/11/we-will-campaign-for-pr |title=Letters: We will continue to campaign for PR |work=The Guardian |date=11 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2011, Owen revealed that his \"heart was with Labour\" and that he looked forward to the time when he could vote Labour again. He added that what hampered him in the past was the way the Labour Party elects its leader and it was very necessary for the electoral college arrangement to be reformed and he refused to rule out joining the Labour Party in the future. He vigorously opposed the Health and Social Care Bill in 2011\u201312. In a pamphlet, \"Fatally Flawed\", he demonstrated that far from the internal market, which he had championed in the 1980s, the Bill introduced an external market and he worked closely with the Labour Front Bench in the House of Lords.\n\nIn March 2014, it was revealed that Owen had donated over \u00a37,500 to the Labour Party, following leader [[Ed Miliband]]'s reforms of the party's links with trade unions. No longer eligible to sit as a crossbencher, Owen now sits in the House of Lords as an \"independent social democrat\".<ref name=\"NSMarch2014\" />\n\nIn the June 2017 General Election, Owen continued to support the Labour Party, though he had once been a political opponent of Labour's new leader, [[Jeremy Corbyn]]. He made political donations to the national Labour Party, as well as the Labour candidate in Plymouth Sutton & Devonport, [[Luke Pollard]], who successfully won the seat.<ref>[http://sybriefing.co.uk/2017/05/19/former-sdp-leader-david-owen-backs-corbyns-manifesto-and-donates-to-labour 'Former SDP leader David Owen backs Corbyn's manifesto and donates to Labour'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225203210/http://sybriefing.co.uk/2017/05/19/former-sdp-leader-david-owen-backs-corbyns-manifesto-and-donates-to-labour/ |date=25 December 2017 }} SY Briefing, 19 May 2017</ref>\nCurrently, he is on the advisory board of OMFIF where he is regularly involved in meetings regarding the financial and monetary system.\n\n==Subsequent international role==\nIn August 1992, Owen was British Prime Minister John Major's choice to succeed Lord Carrington as the EU co-chairman of the Conference for the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|Former Yugoslavia]], along with [[Cyrus Vance]], the former US Secretary of State as the UN co-chairman.\n\n''[[Private Eye]]'', the British satirical magazine, playfully alluded towards Owen's legendary tendency towards self-destruction. \"It's a lost cause\", says the bubble emanating from Major's mouth. \"I'm your man\", says the bubble from Owen's mouth. The Labour Shadow Foreign Minister, [[Jack Cunningham]], greeted Major's appointment of Owen in the British House of Commons by saying that the Prime Minister's choice \"was regarded as somewhat eccentric by [MPs] and myself - he [Owen] is known for many qualities, but not as a mediator. Indeed he has Balkanised a few political parties himself.\"<ref>''Unfinest Hour: Britain and the Destruction of Bosnia'' [2001] by [[Brendan Simms]] p137</ref>\n\nOwen became a joint author of the [[Vance\u2013Owen plan|Vance\u2013Owen Peace Plan]] (VOPP), in January 1993, which made an effort to move away from the presumption of ethnic partition.<ref>Balkan Tragedy (1995) Susan L. Woodward p304</ref> According to America's last ambassador to Yugoslavia, the Bosnian Government were ready to accept the VOPP, but unfortunately the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] delayed in its support, thus missing a chance to get it launched.<ref>Origins of the Catastrophe (1999) Warren Zimmermann p222</ref> The VOPP was eventually agreed in Athens in May 1993 under intense pressure by all parties including Bosnian Serb leader [[Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107]] but then rejected later by the Bosnian-Serb Assembly meeting in Pale, after Karad\u017ei\u0107 insisted that the Assembly had the right to ratify the agreement. After Vance's withdrawal, Owen and [[Thorvald Stoltenberg]] brokered the EU Action Plan of December 1993. They both helped the Contact Group of the US/UK/France/Germany and Russia to present its plan in the summer of 1994.\n\nIn early 1994, the [[European Parliament]] voted by 160 votes to 90, with 2 abstentions, for Owen's dismissal, but he was supported by all 15 EU Member State governments. There was a perception in America that Owen was \"not fulfilling his function as an impartial negotiator\".<ref>''Unfinest Hour'', p167</ref> Owen, however, was consistently supported by all 15 EU Member States and the German Presidency in July 1994 urged him to remain as did the French Presidency in January 1995. Owen was made a [[Companion of Honour]] for his services in the former Yugoslavia in 1994.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=53696 |date=11 June 1994 |page=5  |supp=y}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1995, Lord Owen wrote to [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] as [[President of the European Union]] to say that he wished to step down before the end of the French presidency. At the end of May 1995, he was succeeded by the former Swedish Prime Minister [[Carl Bildt]]. \"Had I been younger, I would probably have resigned when the Americans ditched the Vance-Owen Peace Plan\".<ref>''Unfinest Hour'' p 157\u20138</ref>\n\nOwen testified as a witness of the court in the [[trial of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], the former president of [[FR Yugoslavia]].\n\nLord Owen has continued to speak out on issues of international affairs including on nuclear proliferation and constrained intervention. In 2011 he was the first politician to call for a \"no-fly zone\" over Libya. In an editorial on 27 February 2011 the Sunday Times said, \"It was a man who has not been in office for nearly 32 years - Lord Owen, the former foreign secretary - who has been the most eloquent British voice over Libya. His call for a no-fly-zone&nbsp;... struck the right note\".\n\n===Contaminated blood scandal===\nAs former Minister of State for Health, Lord Owen has long been highly critical of previous governments for their role in and handling of the [[Tainted blood scandal (United Kingdom)|tainted blood scandal]].

In February 2010, he wrote a pamphlet for the [[Social Market Foundation]] thinktank entitled \"EU Social Market and Social Policy\". Owen supports the referendum requirements within the [[European Union Act 2011]].\n\nLord Owen continued to argue for engagement, criticising David Cameron's so-called 'veto' in December 2011 and arguing instead for a formal non-eurozone grouping with the right to join or leave the eurozone. In June 2012 Lord Owen published ''Europe Restructured'', outlining a blueprint for restructuring the EU to allow for those countries that wish to be part of a more integrated eurozone to be facilitated while those who may only want to belong to a Single Market community are enabled to do so.

person in over forty years to hold the post. In 1981, Owen was one of the \"[[Gang of Four (SDP)|Gang of Four]]\" who left the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] to found the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP). Owen led the SDP from 1983 to 1987, and the [[Social Democratic Party (UK, 1988)|continuing SDP]] from 1988 to 1990. Appointed as a [[life peer]] in 1992, he sat in the [[House of Lords]] as a [[crossbencher]] until March 2014, and now sits as an \"independent social democrat\".<ref name=\"NSMarch2014\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/03/david-owen-joins-milibands-big-tent-donation-labour-more-%C2%A37500|title=David Owen joins Miliband's big tent with donation to Labour of more than \u00a37,500 |first=George |last=Eaton |work=New Statesman|date=2 March 2014|accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of his career, Owen has held, and resigned from, a number of senior posts. He first quit as Labour's spokesman on defence in 1972 in protest at the Labour leader [[Harold Wilson]]'s attitude to the [[European Community|EEC]]; he left the Labour [[Shadow cabinet]] over the same issue later; and over [[unilateral disarmament]] in November 1980 when [[Michael Foot]] became Labour leader. He resigned from the Labour Party when it rejected [[one member, one vote]] in February 1981 and later as Leader of the Social Democratic Party, which he had helped to found, after the party's rank-and-file membership voted to merge with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].\n\n==Early life==\nOwen was born in 1938 to [[Welsh people|Welsh]] parents in [[Plympton]], near the city of [[Plymouth]], in [[Devon]], England.<ref name = \"Harris1\">{{harvnb|Harris|1988|p=1}}</ref> He also has Swiss and Irish ancestry.<ref name = \"Harris1\"/> After schooling at Mount House School, [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]], and [[Bradfield College]], Berkshire,<ref>{{harvnb|Harris|1988|p=7}}</ref> he was admitted to [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]] in 1956 to study Medicine, and obtained a [[2:2]];  he was made an Honorary Fellow of the college in 1977. He began clinical training at [[St Thomas's Hospital]] in October 1959.\n\nOwen was deeply affected by the [[Suez crisis]] of 1956, when [[Anthony Eden]]'s Conservative government launched a military operation to retrieve the Suez Canal after [[Nasser]]'s decision to nationalise it. At the time, aged 18, he was working on a labouring job before going to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. Owen later told [[Kenneth Harris (journalist)|Kenneth Harris]]:\n\n<blockquote>[T]here was [[Hugh Gaitskell|Gaitskell]]...criticizing Eden, and here were these men working alongside me, who should have been his natural supporters, furious with him. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' backed Gaitskell, but these men were tearing up their ''Daily Mirror''s every day. ... My working mates were solidly in favour of Eden. It was not only that they taught me how people like them think; they also opened my eyes to how I should think myself. From then on I never identified with the liberal \u2013 with a small 'l' \u2013 establishment. Through that experience I became suspicious of a kind of automatic sogginess which you come across in many aspects of British life. ... The rather defeatist, even traitorous attitude reflected in the pre-war Apostles at Cambridge. I suppose it underlay the appeasement years. Its modern equivalent is a resigned attitude to Britain's continuous post-war economic decline.<ref>{{harvnb|Harris|1988|p=17}}</ref><ref>David Marquand, ''The Progressive Dilemma: From Lloyd George to Blair'' (London: Phoenix, 1999), p. 203.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Medicine and politics==\nIn 1960, Owen joined the [[Vauxhall]] branch of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Fabian Society]]. He qualified as a doctor in 1962 and began work at St Thomas's Hospital. In 1964, he contested the [[Torrington (UK Parliament constituency)|Torrington]] seat as the Labour candidate against the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] incumbent, losing in what was a traditional Conservative-[[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Constituency|marginal]]. He was [[neurology]] and psychiatric [[Specialist registrar|registrar]] at St Thomas's Hospital for two years, as assistant to Dr. [[William Sargant]], then Research Fellow on the Medical Unit doing research into Parkinsonian trauma and neuropharmacology.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nAt the next [[1966 United Kingdom general election|general election, in 1966]], Owen returned to his home town and was elected Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for the [[Plymouth Sutton (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Sutton]] [[constituency]]. In the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] Owen became Labour MP for the adjacent [[Plymouth Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Devonport]] constituency, winning it from the Conservative incumbent [[Dame (title)|Dame]] [[Joan Vickers]] by a slim margin (437 votes). He managed to hold on to it in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], again by a narrow margin (1001 votes). From 1981, however, his involvement with the SDP meant he developed a large personal following in the constituency and thereafter he was re-elected as an SDP candidate with safe margins. He remained as MP for Plymouth Devonport until his elevation to a [[peerage]] in 1992.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1970, Owen served as [[Parliamentary Under Secretary of State]] for the [[Royal Navy|Navy]] in [[Harold Wilson]]'s first government. After Labour's defeat in the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]], he became the party's Junior Defence Spokesman until 1972 when he resigned with [[Roy Jenkins]] over Labour's opposition to the European Community. On Labour's return to government in March 1974, he became Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health before being promoted to Minister of State for [[Department of Health (UK)|Health]] in July 1974.\n\n==In Government==\nAs Minister of State for Health he encouraged Britain to become \"self-sufficient\" in blood products such as [[Factor VIII]], a recommendation also promoted by the World Health Organisation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/finalreport/pdf/PEN0131125.PDF |title=Final report|work=Penrose inquiry}}</ref> This was principally due to the risk of Hepatitis infection from high-risk blood donors overseas who were often paid and from \"skid-row\" locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARkDcNL8ozU&t=1388s|title=World In Action - Blood Money Part 2 - December 1975|date=2 January 2013|publisher=CampaignTB|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqt0xXz-saw|title=Lord David Owen - Bad Blood Speech 29/9/16|date=30 September 2016|publisher=Factor8Scandal|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Haemophiliac HIV tragedy \u2032needless\u2032 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1470755.stm |work=BBC News|location=London |date=3 August 2001 |access-date=2020-04-20|quote= ''Lord Owen, Secretary of State for Health in 1975, claimed the Department of Health failed to spend money allocated to stop the import of blood and blood products from abroad.

Five months later, however, the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Anthony Crosland]], died suddenly and Owen was appointed his successor. Aged 38, he became the youngest Foreign Secretary since [[Anthony Eden]] in 1935.\n\nAs Foreign Secretary, Owen was identified with the Anglo-American plan for [[Rhodesia]], which formed the basis for the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], negotiated by his Tory successor, [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]], in December 1979. The Contact Group sponsored [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 435|UN Resolution 435]] in 1978 on which Namibia moved to independence twelve years later. He wrote a book entitled ''Human Rights'' and championed that cause in Africa and in the Soviet Union. He has admitted to at one stage contemplating the assassination of [[Idi Amin]] while Foreign Secretary but settled instead to backing with money for arms purchases to [[Julius Nyerere|President Nyerere]] of [[Tanzania]] in his armed attack on [[Uganda]] which led to the exile of Amin to [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nShortly after Labour's defeat in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 General Election]] and following the [[1979 Labour Party (UK) Shadow Cabinet election|election of a new Shadow Cabinet]] Callaghan moved Owen from the position of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Shadow Foreign Secretary]] to [[Shadow Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change|Shadow Energy Secretary]], a move which was reported as being a demotion.<ref name=\"GH15061979\">{{cite news |last1=Parkhouse |first1=Geoffrey |title=Shore steps up as Owen is demoted |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19790615&printsec=frontpage&hl=en |accessdate=8 January 2019 |work=Glasgow Herald |date=15 June 1979|via=Google News}}</ref>\n\n18 months after Labour lost power, the staunchly left-wing politician [[Michael Foot]] was elected party leader, despite vocal opposition from Labour Party moderates (including Owen), sparking a crisis over the party's future.\n\n==Social Democratic Party and Liberal-SDP Alliance==\n[[File:Dr David Owen, 1981.jpg|thumb|left|Owen speaking in 1981]]\n[[Michael Foot]]'s election as Labour party leader indicated that the party was likely to become more left-wing, and in 1980 committed itself to withdrawing from the EEC without even a referendum (as Labour had carried out in 1975). Labour also endorsed unilateral nuclear disarmament and introduced an electoral college for leadership elections, with 40% of the college going to a block vote of the trade unions.\n\nEarly in 1981, Owen and three other senior moderate Labour politicians \u2013 [[Roy Jenkins]], [[Bill Rodgers (politician)|Bill Rodgers]] and [[Shirley Williams]] \u2013 announced their intention to break away from the Labour Party to form a \"Council for Social Democracy\". The announcement became known as the [[Limehouse Declaration]] and the four as the \"[[Social Democratic Party (UK)#Creation of the SDP|Gang of Four]]\". The council they formed became the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP), with a collective leadership.<ref name=\"ChildsStorry2013\">{{cite book|author1=Peter Childs|author2=Michael Storry|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlsKXeRt0wgC&pg=PA485|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-134-75555-4|page=485|via=Google Books}}</ref> Although Owen was one of the founding members of the party, he was not always enthusiastic about creating a [[schism]] on the [[centre-left]], saying to the ''[[Glasgow Herald]]'' in January 1981 that he felt \"haunted by the possibility that, if the Labour Party splits, the centre left will never again form the Government in Britain\".<ref>{{cite news|title=The Gang of Three hold talks|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CbZAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HqYMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2855%2C2895895|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=Glasgow Herald|date=19 January 1981|page=1|via=Google News}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-eight other Labour MPs and one Conservative MP ([[Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler]]) joined the new party. In late 1981, the SDP formed the [[SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] to strengthen both parties' chances in the UK's \"[[Plurality voting system|first past the post]]\" electoral system. The alliance performed so well that for much of the early part of 1982, it appeared that it would become a centre-left coalition government at the next election. In 1982, uneasy about the Alliance, Owen challenged Jenkins for the leadership of the SDP, but was defeated by 26,256 votes to 20,864. In the following year's [[1983 United Kingdom general election|General Election]], the Alliance gained 25% of the vote, only slightly behind the Labour Party, but because of the [[first-past-the-post voting system]], it won only 23 out of 650 seats. Although elected, Jenkins resigned the SDP leadership and Owen succeeded to it without a contest among the six remaining SDP MPs.\n\nIn 1982, during the [[Falklands War]], Owen spoke at the [[Bilderberg Meeting|Bilderberg Group]] advocating sanctions against Argentina.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4149485,00.html|title=Who pulls the strings?

I'm sure that various foreign ministers went back to their respective countries and told their leaders what David Owen had said. And you know what? Sanctions were imposed\"}}</ref> Ironically, the success of the war ended any hope that SDP might have had of winning the 1983 election. The Tories were proving unpopular largely due to high unemployment and the [[early 1980s recession]], while Labour's [[democratic socialism|democratic-socialist]] policies were driving away moderate voters. However, Britain's success in the conflict saw [[Margaret Thatcher]] and her Tory government surge back to the top of the opinion polls, and her position was strengthened further by the end of the year as the recession ended and more voters had faith in her economic policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1983_over.stm|title=1983: Maggie's Landslide|work=Election Battles 1945\u20131997|publisher=BBC News|year=2001|accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===SDP leadership===\nOwen is widely regarded as having been, at the very least, a competent party leader. He had high popularity ratings throughout his leadership as did the SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance. He succeeded in keeping the party in the public eye and in maintaining its independence from the Liberals for the length of the 1983 Parliament. Moreover, under him, the SDP increased its representation from six to eight seats via the by-election victories of [[Mike Hancock (UK politician)|Mike Hancock]], at [[1984 Portsmouth South by-election|Portsmouth South]] (1984), and [[Rosie Barnes]], at [[1987 Greenwich by-election|Greenwich]] (1987).\n\nHowever, the progress of the SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance as a whole was hampered, with policy splits between the two parties. The first was over the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|miners' strike of 1984\u201385]], with Owen and most of the SDP favouring a fairly tough line but the Liberals preferring compromise and negotiation. More significantly the Alliance had a dispute over the future of Britain's independent nuclear deterrent. Owen and the SDP favoured replacing [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] with [[Trident (missile)|Trident]] as a matter of some importance, whereas most Liberals were either indifferent to the issue or committed disarmers. The SDP favoured a radical [[social market economy]], while the Liberals mostly favoured a more interventionist, [[Corporatism|corporate]] style approach. The cumulative effect of these divisions was to make the Alliance appear less credible as a potential government in the eyes of the electorate.\n\nMoreover, Owen, unlike Jenkins, faced an increasingly moderate Labour Party under [[Neil Kinnock]] and a dynamic Conservative government. The [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] was as disappointing for the Alliance as the 1983 election and it lost one seat. Nevertheless, it won over 23% of the vote \u2013 at that time, the second-largest third-placed vote in British politics since 1929.\n\n=== Full parties' merger ===\nIn 1987 immediately after the election, the Liberal leader [[David Steel]] proposed a full merger of the Liberal and SDP parties and was supported for the SDP by Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams and Bill Rodgers. Owen rejected this notion outright, on the grounds that he and other Social Democrats wished to remain faithful to [[social democracy]] as it was practised within Western Europe, and it was unlikely that any merged party would be able to do this, even if it was under his leadership. Nevertheless, the majority of the SDP membership supported the merger.\n\nThe Liberal Party and SDP merged to form the Social and Liberal Democrats (SLD) in March 1988, renamed the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in October 1989.\n\nAt the request of two of the remaining SDP MPs, [[John Cartwright (UK politician)|John Cartwright]] and [[Rosie Barnes]], Owen continued to lead a much smaller [[Social Democratic Party (UK, 1988)|continuing SDP]], with three MPs in total. The party polled well at its first election, its candidate coming a close second in the 1989 [[1989 Richmond (Yorks) by-election|Richmond by-election]], but thereafter a string of poor and ultimately disastrous by-election results followed, including coming behind the [[Official Monster Raving Loony Party]] in the [[May 1990 Bootle by-election|Bootle by-election]] of May 1990, prompting Owen to wind up the party in 1990. Owen blamed the SDP's demise on the reforms which had been taking place in the Labour Party since Kinnock's election as leader in 1983.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1136223.stm | work=BBC News | title=SDP: Breaking the mould | date=25 January 2001}}</ref>\n\nSome branches, however, continued to function using the [[Social Democratic Party (UK, 1990)|SDP name]]; [[Bridlington]]'s was still extant in 2006.\n\n[[Richard Holme, Baron Holme of Cheltenham|Lord Holme]] later blamed Owen for the Alliance's failure to make a breakthrough at the 1987 general election, believing that a merged party would have performed much better and possibly gained more votes and seats than Labour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epolitix.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/top-ten-lib-dem-breakthrough-moments/ |title=Top Ten: Lib Dem 'breakthrough moments' |publisher=ePolitix.com |date=24 April 2010 |accessdate=19 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512171830/http://www.epolitix.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/top-ten-lib-dem-breakthrough-moments/ |archivedate=12 May 2010  }}</ref>\n\n===Political allegiances as a life peer===\nAfter winding up the re-formed SDP, Owen announced his intention to stand down as an MP at the next General Election. He then served the remainder of his term as an independent MP and after the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 General Election]] was made a [[life peer]], nominated by then Conservative Prime Minister, [[John Major]], with the title \"'''Baron Owen''', of the City of [[Plymouth]]\",<ref>{{London Gazette\n| issue = 52981\n| date = 3 July 1992\n|page=11255\n}}</ref> in [[Letters Patent]] dated 30 June 1992. As a member of the [[House of Lords]], he is called \"Lord Owen\" and he sat as a [[crossbencher]] until 2014 (see below). Owen was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from [[Plymouth University]] in 1992.\n\nDuring the April 1992 election campaign, Owen writing in ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' newspaper advised voters to vote Liberal Democrat where they had a chance of victory and to vote Conservative rather than let Neil Kinnock become Prime Minister. Owen maintained his long-standing position that he would never join the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], although the memoirs of at least three of [[John Major]]'s cabinet ministers refer to Major being quite keen to appoint Owen to his cabinet, but threats of resignation from within the Cabinet prevented him from doing so. When asked in a conversation with [[Woodrow Wyatt]] on 18 December 1988 whether she would have Owen in her government if approached by him, [[Margaret Thatcher]] replied: \"Well, not straight away. I don't think I would do it straight away. He was very good on the [[Northern Ireland]] terrorist business. He's wasting his life now. It's so tragic. He's got real ability and it ought to be used\".<ref>Sarah Curtis (ed.), ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt.

Lord Owen declined mainly because he disagreed with Tony Blair's intention, as Prime Minister, to join the eurozone.<ref>David Owen, Time to Declare: Second Innings (Politico's, 2009)</ref>\n\nIn May 2005, he was approached two days before the General Election by someone very close to [[Tony Blair]] to endorse Labour. He declined, because though he did not want a Conservative government, he wanted the Liberal Democrats to do sufficiently well to ensure a greatly reduced Labour majority.<ref>David Owen ''In Sickness and in Power'' p.305</ref>\n\nIn September 2007, it was widely reported in the British press that Lord Owen had met the new Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] and afterwards had refused to rule out supporting Labour at the next general election.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kite |first=Melissa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1563255/David-Owen-in-talks-with-Gordon-Brown.html |title=David Owen in talks with Gordon Brown |work=The Telegraph |date=16 September 2007 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> It later emerged that he could have been part of the GOAT (Government of all talents) initiative advising on the NHS but Lord Owen declined. In October 2009 he wrote an article in ''[[The Times]]'' predicting that the Conservatives, then well ahead in the opinion polls, were unlikely to win an outright majority. He helped create the web-based Charter 2010 to explain and promote the potential of a [[hung parliament]]. The website campaign was launched in January 2010 while the Conservatives still appeared on course to win outright. Within weeks the polls changed and the website became a major source of information about hung parliaments. In May 2010 ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' called Owen \"the prophet of the coalition\".\n\nDuring the [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum|2011 Alternative Vote referendum]] he signed a letter in ''[[The Guardian]]'' stating that he opposed AV but would continue to campaign for proportional representation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/mar/11/we-will-campaign-for-pr |title=Letters: We will continue to campaign for PR |work=The Guardian |date=11 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2011, Owen revealed that his \"heart was with Labour\" and that he looked forward to the time when he could vote Labour again. He added that what hampered him in the past was the way the Labour Party elects its leader and it was very necessary for the electoral college arrangement to be reformed and he refused to rule out joining the Labour Party in the future. He vigorously opposed the Health and Social Care Bill in 2011\u201312. In a pamphlet, \"Fatally Flawed\", he demonstrated that far from the internal market, which he had championed in the 1980s, the Bill introduced an external market and he worked closely with the Labour Front Bench in the House of Lords.\n\nIn March 2014, it was revealed that Owen had donated over \u00a37,500 to the Labour Party, following leader [[Ed Miliband]]'s reforms of the party's links with trade unions. No longer eligible to sit as a crossbencher, Owen now sits in the House of Lords as an \"independent social democrat\".<ref name=\"NSMarch2014\" />\n\nIn the June 2017 General Election, Owen continued to support the Labour Party, though he had once been a political opponent of Labour's new leader, [[Jeremy Corbyn]]. He made political donations to the national Labour Party, as well as the Labour candidate in Plymouth Sutton & Devonport, [[Luke Pollard]], who successfully won the seat.<ref>[http://sybriefing.co.uk/2017/05/19/former-sdp-leader-david-owen-backs-corbyns-manifesto-and-donates-to-labour 'Former SDP leader David Owen backs Corbyn's manifesto and donates to Labour'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225203210/http://sybriefing.co.uk/2017/05/19/former-sdp-leader-david-owen-backs-corbyns-manifesto-and-donates-to-labour/ |date=25 December 2017 }} SY Briefing, 19 May 2017</ref>\nCurrently, he is on the advisory board of OMFIF where he is regularly involved in meetings regarding the financial and monetary system.\n\n==Subsequent international role==\nIn August 1992, Owen was British Prime Minister John Major's choice to succeed Lord Carrington as the EU co-chairman of the Conference for the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|Former Yugoslavia]], along with [[Cyrus Vance]], the former US Secretary of State as the UN co-chairman.\n\n''[[Private Eye]]'', the British satirical magazine, playfully alluded towards Owen's legendary tendency towards self-destruction. \"It's a lost cause\", says the bubble emanating from Major's mouth. \"I'm your man\", says the bubble from Owen's mouth. The Labour Shadow Foreign Minister, [[Jack Cunningham]], greeted Major's appointment of Owen in the British House of Commons by saying that the Prime Minister's choice \"was regarded as somewhat eccentric by [MPs] and myself - he [Owen] is known for many qualities, but not as a mediator. Indeed he has Balkanised a few political parties himself.\"<ref>''Unfinest Hour: Britain and the Destruction of Bosnia'' [2001] by [[Brendan Simms]] p137</ref>\n\nOwen became a joint author of the [[Vance\u2013Owen plan|Vance\u2013Owen Peace Plan]] (VOPP), in January 1993, which made an effort to move away from the presumption of ethnic partition.<ref>Balkan Tragedy (1995) Susan L. Woodward p304</ref> According to America's last ambassador to Yugoslavia, the Bosnian Government were ready to accept the VOPP, but unfortunately the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] delayed in its support, thus missing a chance to get it launched.<ref>Origins of the Catastrophe (1999) Warren Zimmermann p222</ref> The VOPP was eventually agreed in Athens in May 1993 under intense pressure by all parties including Bosnian Serb leader [[Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107]] but then rejected later by the Bosnian-Serb Assembly meeting in Pale, after Karad\u017ei\u0107 insisted that the Assembly had the right to ratify the agreement. After Vance's withdrawal, Owen and [[Thorvald Stoltenberg]] brokered the EU Action Plan of December 1993. They both helped the Contact Group of the US/UK/France/Germany and Russia to present its plan in the summer of 1994.\n\nIn early 1994, the [[European Parliament]] voted by 160 votes to 90, with 2 abstentions, for Owen's dismissal, but he was supported by all 15 EU Member State governments. There was a perception in America that Owen was \"not fulfilling his function as an impartial negotiator\".<ref>''Unfinest Hour'', p167</ref> Owen, however, was consistently supported by all 15 EU Member States and the German Presidency in July 1994 urged him to remain as did the French Presidency in January 1995. Owen was made a [[Companion of Honour]] for his services in the former Yugoslavia in 1994.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=53696 |date=11 June 1994 |page=5  |supp=y}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1995, Lord Owen wrote to [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] as [[President of the European Union]] to say that he wished to step down before the end of the French presidency. At the end of May 1995, he was succeeded by the former Swedish Prime Minister [[Carl Bildt]]. \"Had I been younger, I would probably have resigned when the Americans ditched the Vance-Owen Peace Plan\".<ref>''Unfinest Hour'' p 157\u20138</ref>\n\nOwen testified as a witness of the court in the [[trial of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], the former president of [[FR Yugoslavia]].\n\nLord Owen has continued to speak out on issues of international affairs including on nuclear proliferation and constrained intervention. In 2011 he was the first politician to call for a \"no-fly zone\" over Libya. In an editorial on 27 February 2011 the Sunday Times said, \"It was a man who has not been in office for nearly 32 years - Lord Owen, the former foreign secretary - who has been the most eloquent British voice over Libya. His call for a no-fly-zone&nbsp;... struck the right note\".\n\n===Contaminated blood scandal===\nAs former Minister of State for Health, Lord Owen has long been highly critical of previous governments for their role in and handling of the [[Tainted blood scandal (United Kingdom)|tainted blood scandal]].

In February 2010, he wrote a pamphlet for the [[Social Market Foundation]] thinktank entitled \"EU Social Market and Social Policy\". Owen supports the referendum requirements within the [[European Union Act 2011]].\n\nLord Owen continued to argue for engagement, criticising David Cameron's so-called 'veto' in December 2011 and arguing instead for a formal non-eurozone grouping with the right to join or leave the eurozone. In June 2012 Lord Owen published ''Europe Restructured'', outlining a blueprint for restructuring the EU to allow for those countries that wish to be part of a more integrated eurozone to be facilitated while those who may only want to belong to a Single Market community are enabled to do so.
