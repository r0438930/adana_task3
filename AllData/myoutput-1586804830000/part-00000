The title is a corruption of \"melodrama\", thought to harken back to the earliest [[minstrel shows]], as a film short based on [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s [[abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' and stars [[Mickey Mouse]] and his friends who stage their own production of the novel.\n\nThe cartoon shows Mickey Mouse and some of the other characters dressed in [[blackface]] with exaggerated, orange lips; bushy, white sidewhiskers made out of cotton; and his usual white gloves.\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn ''Mickey's Mellerdrammer'', Mickey Mouse, [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Goofy]] (known then as [[Dippy Dawg]]) and others present their own low budget light-hearted rendition of the 19th century [[Tom Shows]] for a crowd in a barn converted into a theater for the occasion.\n\n[[Horace Horsecollar]] plays the white slave owner [[Simon Legree]]. Minnie plays the young white girl, Eva. Mickey plays old [[Uncle Tom]] with cotton around his ears and chin, and the young slave girl Topsy. [[Clarabelle Cow]] plays the slave woman Eliza. [[Goofy]] plays the production stage hand.\n\nThe cartoon opens with Mickey and Clarabelle Cow in their dressing rooms applying [[blackface]] makeup for their roles (Mickey originally used a small dynamite to black up his face). The cartoon is much more focused on the Disney characters' efforts to put on the play, than an animated version of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]. The cartoon contains many images of Mickey and the other characters using makeshift props as sight gags.\n\nThe cartoon closes with the characters coming out for a bow, and Horace Horsecollar's character is pelted with rotten tomatoes. When Goofy shows his face from behind the stage, he is hit with a chocolate pie, leaving him in what appears to be [[blackface]], as Goofy laughs making the cartoon to end.\n\nThis short was released in Pathescope [[9.5 mm film|9.5mm]] print in the UK in 1954.\n\n==Ethnic stereotyping==\n\nStereotyped characterizations of black people were then common.
