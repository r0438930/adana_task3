He attended the [[University of Genoa]], where he studied history of art with Eugenio Battisti. In 1963 he worked as assistant editor for Marcatr\u00e8, a Genoa-based magazine about architecture, art, design, music and literature founded by Rodolfo Vitone,<ref>See R. Barilli, ''Rodolfo Vitone. Trent'anni di ricerca e creativit\u00e0,'' DeFerrari, Genoa, 1997 p. 47: \"On his return from Paris, (R. Vitone) founded the contemporary culture magazine 'Marcatr\u00e8' entrusting Mr. Eugenio Battisti with the direction\".</ref> Eugenio Battisti, [[Paolo Portoghesi]], [[Diego Carpitella]], Maurizio Calvesi, [[Umberto Eco]], [[Vittorio Gelmetti]] and [[Edoardo Sanguineti]]. In 1967, his manifesto of Arte Povera, ''Notes for a Guerilla'', was published in [[Flash Art]]. The concept of Arte Povera seemed to be that in Italy art was quite different from [[United States|America]] due to the different circumstances at the time. Italy was going through an [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] period but was not really making the [[pop art]] that coincided with the established economy as opposed to American artists like [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and other pop artists. The Italian artists were going for a [[humanism]] in their art and not for the coolness and calculated machine-made imagery of the pop artists.\n\n\"Arte Povera\" was essentially formed around two nuclei: one in [[Turin]], with artists such as [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]], [[Mario Merz]], [[Marisa Merz]], [[Giuseppe Penone]], [[Giulio Paolini]], Giovanni Anselmo, and Piero Gilardi; and one in [[Rome]], with [[Alighiero Boetti]], [[Jannis Kounellis]] and [[Pino Pascali]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/13/arts/mario-merz-78-an-italian-installation-artist.htm ]{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref> Celant went on to organize Arte Povera exhibitions at Galleria La Bertesca in Genoa (1967), Galleria De' Foscherari in [[Bologna]] (1968), and a three-day performance event called \"Arte Povera & Azioni Povere at Amalfi\" (1968).\n\nIn 1974, Celant edited and curated the [[Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9]] of Italian artist [[Piero Manzoni]]. He curated many exhibitions on Italian art, including \"Identit\u00e9 italienne. L'art en Italie depuis 1959\" (Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, 1981), \"Italian art, 1900-1945\" ([[Palazzo Grassi]], Venice, 1989; with [[Pontus Hult\u00e9n]]), and \"Italian Metamorphosis 1943-1968\" (Guggenheim Museum, New York, 1994). In 1997, he was the director of the [[Venice Biennale]] and in 2004, he curated the exhibition \"Art and Architecture\" in Genoa when the city was nominated as European Capital of Culture. From 1977, he was a contributing editor to ''[[Artforum]]'' and from 1991 he was a contributing editor to ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]''.\n\nIn 1988, Celant was appointed Senior Curator of Contemporary Art at the [[Solomon R.
