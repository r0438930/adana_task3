The [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] has caused a decline in the number and scale of the protests with most protest related activities happening online especially on games like [[Animal Crossing]].<ref name=\"8dRLE\" /><ref name=\"VdfFn\" /> Resulting in sail of Animal Crossing stopping in [[Censorship in China|China]].<ref name=\"WG4Ik\" />\n\n== Events ==\n=== 8 April ===\nProtesters mourned the death of Zhou Zile, who passed away 5 mouths ago. A large number of riot police were on patrol at [[Tseung Kwan O station|Tseung Kwan O Station]] and the parking lot of Shangde Village at 5 pm, and observed and photographed the ground conditions at the upper level of the parking lot. Under the \"Limitation Order\", only a small number of citizens lay flowers outside the Suntech parking lot. Some citizens were dissatisfied and asked to leave by police officers.<ref name=\"s5GV2\" />\n\n=== 9 April ===\nThe [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] ruled that the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong government]]\u2019s use of the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] to formulate the [[Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation]] was constitutional. Part of the government\u2019s appeal was justified, and the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation was effective when protesters assembled illegally or without approval. The two provisions of \"Prohibition of masking during legal processions and meetings\" and \"Police officers have the right to require persons in public places to remove masked items\" remain unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal said that whether it is illegal assembly or unauthorised assembly, it is also necessary to deter people from wearing masked items and impede the proper implementation of the provisions of the [[Public Order Ordinance]]. Under such circumstances, the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation is constitutionally valid. However, it is unconstitutional to use the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation in the procession and assembly of the \"No Objection Notice\" issued by the police.<ref name=\"QO0Nd\" /><ref name=\"p4jsS\" />\n\n=== 15 April ===\nThe [[Tuen Mun]] [[Magistrates' Court (Hong Kong)|Magistrates\u2019 Courts]] sentenced a 21-year-old male barista, who burned and trampled on the flag outside the Tuen Mun Town Hall during a confrontation in Tuen Mun on September 21, 2019, to 240-hour social service order.<ref name=\"PbX7X\" />\n\n=== 18 April ===\n[[Hong Kong Police Force|Hong Kong police]] arrested 15 [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|Democrats]] in the morning of 18 April.

With them taking part in demonstrations last year.<ref name=\"pEeMk\" />\n\nFrom 2 p.m, about 30 protesters went outside the Changsha Bay Police Station to support the arrested politicians. During the protest police officers in the police station spoke to the protesters three times alleging that protesters at the scene were involved in violation of the \"restriction order\" and demanded them to disperse. By 4 pm Fu Zhenzhong, the founder of the Hong Kong Defence Movement, and several pro-police protesters were on the scene against the pro-democracy protesters who where holing a sit-in protest.<ref name=\"adrM2\" />\n\nThe arrests attracted the attention of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British]] and [[Federal government of the United States|American]] governments and several international human rights organisations and the [[News|media]]. A total of 5 organisations including the [[International Bar Association]], the [[Law Society of England and Wales]] and the [[International Commission of Jurists]] issued a statement concerned about the arrest of 15 Democrats and believed that the arrests reflected the continued impact of Hong Kong\u2019s [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and right to protest.<ref name=\"myvXf\" /> Former [[Governor of Hong Kong]] [[Chris Patten]] criticised this as not the rule of law, but the actions of an [[authoritarian government]].<ref name=\"GsfFN\" /> [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Mike Pompeo]] issued a statement condemning the arrest, which is not in accordance with the rule of law mentioned in the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]]. The [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] said on [[Twitter]] that Hong Kong\u2019s democracy and [[human rights]] continue to be violated, urging the White House to implement the [[Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act]]. <ref name=\"u84Gr\" /> On April 23, more than 30 members of the [[European Parliament]] issued two co-signed open letters condemning the political prosecution of Hong Kong democrats by the Hong Kong government.<ref name=\"05WCv\" />\n\nA government spokesman pointed out that the relevant cases have entered the [[judicial process]] and no one should make comments about unfounded speculations.<ref name=\"RBwJ3\" /> A spokesperson form the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region said that he expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to the [[European Parliament]]\u2019s criticism, referring to the open letter as \u201chypocrisy and arrogance on the issue of Hong Kong\".<ref name=\"JdLRQ\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of those arrested\n!Political Party\n!Name\n!Previous / Current Public Office\n|-\n|[[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]]\n|[[Martin Lee]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|Democratic Party\n|[[Albert Ho]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|Democratic Party\n|[[Yeung Sum]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|Democratic Party\n|[[Sin Chung-kai]]\n|Current [[Kwai Tsing District Council]] Chairman\n|-\n|Democratic Party\n|[[Richard Tsoi]]\n|\n|-\n|[[League of Social Democrats]]\n|[[Leung Kwok-hung]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|League of Social Democrats\n|[[Raphael Wong]]\n|\n|-\n|League of Social Democrats\n|[[Avery Ng]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Labour Party]]\n|[[Lee Cheuk-yan]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|Labour Party\n|[[Cyd Ho]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|[[Civic Party]]\n|[[Margaret Ng]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|[[Neighbourhood and Worker's Service Centre]]\n|[[Leung Yiu-chung]]\n|Current legislator\n|-\n|[[Independent politician|Independent]]\n|[[Au Nok-hin]]\n|Former legislator\n|-\n|Independent\n|[[Jimmy Lai]]\n|Founder of [[Next Digital]]\n|-\n|Independent\n|Chen Haohuan\n|\n|}\n\n=== 19 April ===\nThe daughter and friends of an over 50 year old woman with asthma who, since October 2019, has been to the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong conflict|demonstrating at the Chinese University of Hong Kong]] to protect the younger protesters inhaled tear gas and was admitted to hospital due to [[Shortness of breath|dyspnea]] but she eventually died at home on 2 December, 2019 due to dyspnea.

There are police officers stationed at the overpasses at the exits of the mall and at the entrance of the [[Exchange Square (Hong Kong)|Exchange Square]].<ref name=\"ZJBd5\" />\n\n==== Man sentenced to 20 days in prison for humiliating a flag ====\nA young man trampled on the national [[Flag of China|flag of the People\u2019s Republic of China]] in a pro-democracy protest in 2019. After pleading guilty, he was initially sentenced to a 200-hour social service order.

Many protesters chanted slogans and waved flags. The police dispatched a large number of police. Officers and police cars where on patrol. By about 6:40, Eastern Commander Wei Zhida, together with a large number of riot police officers holding shields and [[pepper spray]], entered the mall from different locations to disperse the protesters, accusing them of violating the \"restriction order\". The police asks people in the mall to leave one by one.<ref name=\"57VaF\" /> At about 7 o'clock in the evening, the riot police with anti-riot guns entered the second floor of the mall from the underground. The scene was chaotic. During the period, a police officer pointed at reporter with pepper spray. Police officers later pulled up the cordon and some people were stopped and searched outside the mall. At about 8:00, the mall issued a broadcast indicating that it was about to close.<ref name=\"91Orr\" />\n\nSome protesters stayed on nearby roads. The police used a loudspeaker to read the \"Polymerism Restriction Order\", raised a blue flag warning at Yan Palace Pavilion, and began to disperse the crowed. Police surrounded District Councillor [[Andrew Chiu]] and his assistant. The assistant was violently pushed down to the ground by several riot police officers. Afterwards, he could only blink and became unconscious. Police had allowed first-aiders to enter the scene after a delay of 5 minutes.

They repeatedly chanted the slogan \"[[Glory to Hong Kong]]\". Before the event, at least 14 police cars were parked in the General Post Office, outside the [[Hong Kong station|Hong Kong Station MTR]] and the [[Exchange Square (Hong Kong)|Exchange Square]] bus station, and a large number of uniformed police officers were on patrol at the entrances of the shopping malls. By 6:30, two groups of police officers entered multiple floors of the mall and set up a blockade line in the atrium to drive away the citizens and reporter. The police used a megaphone to say that the restraining order was in effect, and warned the public not to gather in the shopping mall, as many shops closed their doors. Another group of police officers stopped several citizens outside the atrium and shops, and issued fixed penalty notices. Liu Dingcheng, a Hong Kong businessman at the scene, criticised the police for not giving a time limit for the public to leave, nor for warning. He believed that the police officers were unreasonable and would not pay a fine. Some people just after work think that the police abuse the \"restriction order\" to charge the public.<ref name=\"VJ3ss\" />\n\nAt about 7 pm, [[Hui Chi-fung]] ,a member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]], was present and asked police officers not to enter the mall to disturb the public.

The police left the mall at 9 pm and went to the B1 exit of Hong Kong Station to intercept the public. Seven young people who returned to the city from [[Cheung Chau]] said they were intercepted when entering the mall.

Part of the government\u2019s appeal was justified, and the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation was effective when protesters assembled illegally or without approval. The two provisions of \"Prohibition of masking during legal processions and meetings\" and \"Police officers have the right to require persons in public places to remove masked items\" remain unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal said that whether it is illegal assembly or unauthorised assembly, it is also necessary to deter people from wearing masked items and impede the proper implementation of the provisions of the [[Public Order Ordinance]]. Under such circumstances, the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation is constitutionally valid. However, it is unconstitutional to use the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation in the procession and assembly of the \"No Objection Notice\" issued by the police.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.tvb.com/local/5e8f006f34b031e87cdd6f84/\u9ad8\u9662\u88c1\u5b9a\u7981\u8499\u9762\u6cd5\u7121\u9055\u61b2-\u975e\u6cd5\u96c6\u7d50\u6216\u672a\u7d93\u6279\u51c6\u96c6\u7d50\u6642\u6709\u6548|title=\u7121\u7dab\u65b0\u805e - \u6e2f\u6fb3 - \u9ad8\u9662\u88c1\u5b9a\u300a\u7981\u8499\u9762\u6cd5\u300b\u7121\u9055\u61b2 \u975e\u6cd5\u96c6\u7d50\u6216\u672a\u7d93\u6279\u51c6\u96c6\u7d50\u6642\u6709\u6548|last=|date=|website=news.tvb.com|publisher=|language=|format=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200409134722/http://news.tvb.com/local/5e8f006f34b031e87cdd6f84/%25E9%25AB%2598%25E9%2599%25A2%25E8%25A3%2581%25E5%25AE%259A%25E7%25A6%2581%25E8%2592%2599%25E9%259D%25A2%25E6%25B3%2595%25E7%2584%25A1%25E9%2581%2595%25E6%2586%25B2-%25E9%259D%259E%25E6%25B3%2595%25E9%259B%2586%25E7%25B5%2590%25E6%2588%2596%25E6%259C%25AA%25E7%25B6%2593%25E6%2589%25B9%25E5%2587%2586%25E9%259B%2586%25E7%25B5%2590%25E6%2599%2582%25E6%259C%2589%25E6%2595%2588|archive-date=2020-04-09|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voachinese.com/a/hong-kong-mask-ban-legal-when-aimed-at-unauthorised-demonstrations-appeal-court-rule-/5365724.html|title=\u6e2f\u9ad8\u9662\u4e0a\u8bc9\u88c1\u51b3\uff1a\u6e2f\u5e9c\u7d27\u6025\u7acb\u6cd5\u5408\u5baa\uff0c\u5408\u6cd5\u96c6\u4f1a\u7981\u8499\u9762\u6cd5\u8fdd\u5baa|website=\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u97f3|language=zh|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n=== 15 April ===\nThe [[Tuen Mun]] [[Magistrates' Court (Hong Kong)|Magistrates\u2019 Courts]] sentenced a 21-year-old male barista, who burned and trampled on the flag outside the Tuen Mun Town Hall during a confrontation in Tuen Mun on September 21, 2019, to 240-hour social service order.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.mingpao.com/pns/%E6%B8%AF%E8%81%9E/article/20200416/s00002/1586976520249/%E5%92%96%E5%95%A1%E5%B8%AB%E7%87%92%E5%9C%8B%E6%97%97%E5%88%A4%E7%A4%BE%E6%9C%8D%E4%BB%A4|title=\u5496\u5561\u5e2b\u71d2\u570b\u65d7\u5224\u793e\u670d\u4ee4|agency=\u660e\u5831}}</ref>\n\n=== 18 April ===\n[[Hong Kong Police Force|Hong Kong police]] arrested 15 [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|Democrats]] in the morning of 18 April.
