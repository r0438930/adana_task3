It is a form of [[electrophoresis]]; charged analytes are separated based on [[ionic mobility]], a quantity which tells how fast an [[ion]] migrates through an [[electric field]].\n\n==Overview==\nIn conventional ITP separations, a discontinuous buffer system is used. The sample is introduced between a zone of fast leading [[electrolyte]] (LE) and a zone of slow terminating (or: trailing) electrolyte (TE). Usually, the LE and the TE have a common [[counterion]], but the co-ions (having charges with the same sign as the analytes of interest) are different: the LE is defined by co-ions with high [[Electrical mobility|ionic mobility]], while the TE is defined by co-ions with low ionic mobility. The analytes of interest have intermediate ionic mobility. Application of an electric potential results in a low [[Electric field|electrical field]] in the leading electrolyte and a high electrical field in the terminating electrolyte. Analyte ions situated in the TE zone will migrate faster than the surrounding TE co-ions, while analyte ions situated in the LE will migrate slower; the result is that analytes are focused at the LE/TE interface.\n\nITP is a displacement method: focusing ions of a certain kind displace other ions. If present in sufficient amounts, focusing analyte ions can displace all electrolyte co-ions, reaching a plateau [[concentration]]. Multiple analytes with sufficiently different ionic mobilities will form multiple plateau zones. Indeed, plateau mode ITP separations are readily recognized by stairlike profiles, each plateau of the stair representing an electrolyte or analyte zone having (from LE to TE) increasing electric fields and decreasing conductivities. In peak mode ITP, analytes amounts are insufficient to reach plateau concentrations, such analytes will focus in sharp [[normal distribution|Gaussian]]-like peaks. In peak mode ITP, analyte peaks will strongly overlap, unless so-called spacer compounds are added with intermediate ionic mobilities between those of the analytes; such spacer compounds are able to segregate adjacent analyte zones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationaldiagnostics.com/electrophoresis/article/isotachophoresis|title=Isotachophoresis {{!}} National Diagnostics|website=www.nationaldiagnostics.com|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>\n\nA completed ITP separation is characterized by a [[dynamic equilibrium]] in which all coionic zones migrate with equal velocities.

In transient ITP, analytes are first concentrated by ITP, and then can be baseline separated by [[capillary zone electrophoresis|zone electrophoresis]]. Transient ITP is usually accomplished by dissolving the sample in the TE and sandwiching the sample/TE plug between LE zones - or vice versa: a sample/LE plug can also be sandwiched between TE zones. In the first case, analytes are focused at the front TE/LE interface. Meanwhile, the back of the TE plug becomes dissolved in the LE because the faster LE ions overcome the TE ions.
