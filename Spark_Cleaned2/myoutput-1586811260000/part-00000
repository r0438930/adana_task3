Douglas\u2019 father, the [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]], disapproved strongly of the affair, and set out to humiliate Wilde, publicly accusing him of homosexuality. Wilde sued him for criminal [[libel]], but some of his intimate notes were discovered, and he was duly jailed. On his release, Wilde briefly lived with Douglas in Naples, but they were separated by the time Wilde died in 1900.\n\nDouglas married [[Olive Custance]] in 1902, and they produced a son, Raymond. Converting to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1911, he openly repudiated Wilde\u2019s homosexuality, and in a High-Catholic magazine, ''Plain English'', he expressed views that were openly [[anti-Semitic]], though he rejected the policies of [[Nazi Germany]]. He was also jailed for libeling [[Winston Churchill]] over claims of wartime misconduct.\n\nDouglas wrote several books of verse, some of it classified in the homoerotic [[Uranian poetry|Uranian]] genre. The phrase \"The love that dare not speak its name\" came from one of Douglas\u2019 poems, though it is widely misattributed to Wilde.\n\n==Early life and background==\n[[File:JohnSholtoDouglasMarquessofQueensberry.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|The 9th Marquess of Queensberry]]]]\nDouglas was born at Ham Hill House in [[Powick]], [[Worcestershire]], the third son of [[The Most Honourable|The Most Hon.]] [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry]] and his first wife, Sibyl Montgomery.\n\nHe was his mother's favourite child; she called him Bosie (a derivative of \"boysie\", as in boy), a nickname which stuck for the rest of his life.<ref name=odnb>{{cite ODNB|id=32869|title=Douglas, Lord Alfred Bruce (1870\u20131945)}}</ref> His mother successfully sued for divorce in 1887 on the grounds of his father's adultery.<ref>\"The Queensberry Divorce Case\", ''The Times'', 24 January 1887, p. 4</ref> The [[Marquess]] married Ethel Weeden in 1893 but the marriage was annulled the following year.\n\nDouglas was educated at [[Wixenford School]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Rupert|last=Croft-Cooke|title=Bosie: The Story of Lord Alfred Douglas, His Friends and Enemies|publisher=[[Bobbs-Merrill Company]]|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|date=1963|isbn=978-1299419407|page=33}}</ref> [[Winchester College]] (1884\u201388) and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] (1889\u201393), which he left without obtaining a degree.

Their relationship had always been a strained one and, during the Queensberry-Wilde feud, Douglas sided with Wilde, even encouraging Wilde to prosecute the Marquess for libel. In 1893, Douglas had a brief affair with [[George Cecil Ives|George Ives]].\n\nIn 1858 his grandfather, [[Archibald Douglas, 8th Marquess of Queensberry]], died in what was reported as a shooting accident, but was widely believed to have been suicide.<ref>Linda Stratmann, The Marquess of Queensberry: Wilde's Nemesis, Yale University Press 2013 p.25</ref><ref>Neil McKenna, The Secret Life Of Oscar Wilde, Random House 2011 p.427</ref> In 1862, his widowed grandmother, Lady Queensberry, converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and took her children to live in [[Paris]].<ref name=schoolnet>[https://spartacus-educational.com/Fdixie.htm Lady Florence Dixie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320041127/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Fdixie.htm |date=20 March 2008 }} at Spartacus-Educational.com (accessed 26 February 2019)</ref>One of his uncles, Lord James Douglas, was deeply attached to his twin sister \"Florrie\" ([[Lady Florence Douglas]]) and was heartbroken when she married a baronet, [[Dixie baronets|Sir Alexander Beaumont Churchill Dixie]].

Montgomery Hyde, ''The Love That Dared not Speak its Name;'' p.144</ref><ref>Ellmann (1988:98)</ref> In 1894, the [[Robert Smythe Hichens|Robert Hichens]] novel ''[[The Green Carnation]]'' was published. Said to be a ''[[roman \u00e0 clef]]'' based on the relationship of Wilde and Douglas, it was one of the texts used against Wilde during his trials in 1895.\n\nDouglas has been described as spoiled, reckless, insolent and extravagant. He would spend money on men and gambling and expected Wilde to contribute to funding his tastes. They often argued and broke up, but would also always reconcile.\n\nDouglas had praised Wilde's play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' in the Oxford magazine, ''The Spirit Lamp'', of which he was editor (and used as a covert means of gaining acceptance for homosexuality). Wilde had originally written ''Salom\u00e9'' in French, and in 1893 he commissioned Douglas to translate it into English. Douglas's French was very poor and his translation was highly criticised; for example, a passage that runs \"''On ne doit regarder que dans les miroirs''\" (\"One should look only in mirrors\") he rendered  \"One must not look at mirrors\". Douglas was angered at Wilde's criticism, and  claimed that the errors were in fact in Wilde's original play. This led to a hiatus in the relationship and a row between the two men, with angry messages being exchanged and even the involvement of the publisher [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]] and the illustrator [[Aubrey Beardsley]] when they themselves objected to Douglas's work. Beardsley complained to [[Robbie Ross]]: \"For one week the numbers of telegraph and messenger boys who came to the door was simply scandalous\". Wilde redid much of the translation himself, but, in a gesture of reconciliation, suggested that Douglas be dedicated as the translator rather than credited, along with him, on the title-page. Accepting this, Douglas, somewhat vainly, likened a dedication to sharing the title-page as \"the difference between a tribute of admiration from an artist and a receipt from a tradesman\".<ref name=\"Ellmann\" />\n\nIn 1894, Douglas came and visited Oscar Wilde in Worthing, much to the consternation of the latter's wife Constance.<ref>Antony Edmunds, ''Oscar Wilde's Scandalous Summer;'' p.26 [http://www.oscarwilde.org.uk/chapter-1.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181128075207/http://www.oscarwilde.org.uk/chapter-1.html |date=28 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\nOn another occasion, while staying with Wilde in [[Brighton]], Douglas fell ill with influenza and was nursed by Wilde, but failed to return the favour when Wilde himself fell ill in consequence. Instead Douglas moved to the [[Grand Hotel (Brighton)|Grand Hotel]] and, on Wilde's 40th birthday, sent him a letter saying that he had charged him the bill. Douglas also gave his old clothes to male prostitutes, but failed to remove from the pockets incriminating letters exchanged between him and Wilde, which were then used for [[blackmail]].<ref name=\"Ellmann\">''Oscar Wilde'' by Richard Ellman, published in 1987</ref>\n\nAlfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, suspected the liaison to be more than a friendship. He sent his son a letter, attacking him for leaving Oxford without a degree and failing to take up a proper career. He threatened to \"disown [Alfred] and stop all money supplies\". Alfred responded with a telegram stating: \"What a funny little man you are\".\n\nQueensberry's next letter threatened his son with a \"thrashing\" and accused him of being \"crazy\". He also threatened to \"make a public scandal in a way you little dream of\" if he continued his relationship with Wilde.\n\nQueensberry was well known for his temper and threatening to beat people with a horsewhip. Alfred sent his father a postcard stating \"I detest you\" and making it clear that he would take Wilde's side in a fight between him and the Marquess, \"with a loaded revolver\".\n\nIn answer Queensberry wrote to Alfred (whom he addressed as \"You miserable creature\") that he had divorced Alfred's mother in order not to \"run the risk of bringing more creatures into the world like yourself\" and that, when Alfred was a baby, \"I cried over you the bitterest tears a man ever shed, that I had brought such a creature into the world, and unwittingly committed such a crime&nbsp;... You must be demented\".\n\nWhen Douglas's eldest brother [[Francis Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig|Francis Viscount Drumlanrig]] died in a suspicious hunting accident in October 1894, rumours circulated that he had been having a homosexual relationship with the Prime Minister, [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]], and that the cause of death was suicide. The Marquess of Queensberry thus embarked on a campaign to save his other son, and began a public persecution of Wilde. Wilde had been openly flamboyant, and his actions made the public suspicious even before the trial.<ref>Ellmann (1988:101)</ref> He and a minder confronted the playwright in his own home; later, Queensberry planned to throw rotten vegetables at Wilde during the premiere of ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', but, forewarned of this, the playwright was able to deny him access to the theatre.\n\nQueensberry then publicly insulted Wilde by leaving, at the latter's club, a [[visiting card]] on which he had written: \"For Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite {{sic}}\". The wording is in dispute \u2013 the handwriting is unclear \u2013 although Hyde reports it as this. According to [[Merlin Holland]], Wilde's grandson, it is more likely \"Posing somdomite\", while Queensberry himself claimed it to be \"Posing as somdomite\". Holland suggests that this wording (\"posing [as] ...\") would have been easier to defend in court.\n\n==The 1895 trials==\n{{Main|Oscar Wilde#Trials|l1=Oscar Wilde \u2013 Trials}}\nIn response to this card, and with Douglas's avid support, but against the advice of friends such as [[Robbie Ross]], [[Frank Harris]], and [[George Bernard Shaw]], Wilde had Queensberry arrested and charged with criminal [[libel]] in a [[private prosecution]], as [[sodomy]] was then a criminal offence. According to libel laws of the time, since his authorship of the charge of sodomy was not in question, Queensberry could avoid conviction only by demonstrating in court not only that the charge he had made was factually true, but that there was also some public interest in having made the charge publicly. [[Edward Carson]], Queensberry's lawyer, accordingly portrayed Wilde as a vicious older man who habitually preyed upon naive young boys and, with extravagant gifts and promises of a glamorous lifestyle, seduced them into a life of homosexuality. Several highly suggestive erotic letters that Wilde had written to Douglas were introduced into evidence; Wilde claimed they were works of art. Wilde was closely questioned about the homoerotic themes in ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' and in ''The Chameleon'', a single-issue magazine published by Douglas to which Wilde had contributed his 'Phrases and Philosophies for Use of the Young'.\n\n[[File:Somdomite.jpg|thumb|The calling card in question, labelled Exhibit A in the trial (bottom left corner)|left]]Queensberry's attorney announced in court that he had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. Wilde's lawyers advised him that this would make a conviction on the libel charge very unlikely; he then dropped the libel charge, on his lawyers' advice, to avoid further pointless scandal. Without a conviction, the libel law of the time left Wilde liable to pay Queensberry's considerable legal costs, leaving him [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]].\n\nBased on the evidence raised during the case, Wilde was arrested the next day and charged with committing criminal [[sodomy]] and \"[[gross indecency between men|gross indecency]]\", a charge only capable of being committed by two men and which covered sexual acts other than sodomy.\n\nDouglas's September 1892 poem \"[[s:Two Loves (1894 poem)|Two Loves]]\" (published in the Oxford magazine ''The Chameleon'' in December 1894), which was used against Wilde at the latter's trial, ends with the famous line that refers to homosexuality as ''[[the love that dare not speak its name]]'', a quote often falsely attributed to Wilde. Wilde gave an eloquent but counterproductive explanation of the nature of this love on the witness stand. The trial resulted in a [[hung jury]].\n\nIn 1895, when during his trials Wilde was released on bail, Douglas's cousin [[Sholto Johnstone Douglas]] stood [[surety]] for [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]500 of the bail money.<ref>Borland, Maureen, ''Wilde's Devoted Friend: A Life of Robert Ross, 1869\u20131918'' (Lennard Publishing, 1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=j2lnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Sholto+Johnstone+Douglas%22&dq=%22Sholto+Johnstone+Douglas%22&ei=j1R5SfWUMpWyyQS4kNSwBg&pgis=1 p. 206] at books.google.com, accessed 22 January 2009</ref> The prosecutor opted to retry the case. Wilde was convicted on 25 May 1895 and sentenced to two years' [[hard labour]], first at [[HM Prison Pentonville|Pentonville]], then [[HM Prison Wandsworth|Wandsworth]], then famously in [[HM Prison Reading|Reading Gaol]]. Douglas was forced into exile in Europe.\n\nWhile in prison, Wilde wrote Douglas a long and critical letter titled ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]'', describing exactly what he felt about him, which Wilde was not permitted to send, but which may or may not have been sent to Douglas after Wilde's release: it was given to Robbie Ross, with the instructions to make a copy and send the original to Lord Alfred Douglas. Lord Alfred Douglas later said that he received only a letter from Ross with a few choice quotes, and didn't know there was a letter until reference was made to it in a biography of Wilde's on which Ross consulted. Following Wilde's release (on 19 May 1897), the two reunited in August at [[Rouen]], but stayed together only a few months owing to personal differences and the various pressures on them.\n\n==Naples and Paris==\nThe meeting in Rouen was disapproved of by the friends and families of both men. During the later part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together in Naples, but because of financial pressures and for other personal reasons, they separated. Wilde spent the remainder of his life primarily in Paris, and Douglas returned to Britain in late 1898.\n\nThe period when the two men lived in Naples later became controversial. Wilde claimed that Douglas had offered a home, but had no funds or ideas. When Douglas eventually did gain funds from his late father's estate, he refused to grant Wilde a permanent allowance, although he did give him occasional handouts. When Wilde died in 1900, he was still bankrupt. Douglas served as chief mourner, although there reportedly was an altercation at the grave between him and Robbie Ross. This struggle developed into a feud<ref>{{cite book|title=World Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvwIAQAAIAAJ|year=1970|publisher=E. Hulton}}</ref> which foreshadowed the later litigations between the two former lovers of Wilde.\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Lady-alfred-douglas.jpg|thumb|upright|Lady Alfred Douglas]]\nAfter Wilde's death, Douglas established a close friendship with [[Olive Custance]], a [[bisexual]] heiress and poet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Sarah|title='A Girl's Love': Lord Alfred Douglas as Homoerotic Muse in the Poetry of Olive Custance|journal=Women: A Cultural Review|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|location=London, England|date=September 2011|volume=22|issue=2\u20133|pages=220\u2013240|doi=10.1080/09574042.2011.585045|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/22672}}</ref> They married on 4 March 1902.

They separated in 1913, lived together for a time in the 1920s after Custance also converted, and then lived apart after she gave up Catholicism. The health of their only child further strained the marriage, which by the end of the 1920s was all but over, although they never divorced.\n\n==Repudiation of Wilde==\nIn 1911, Douglas embraced Roman Catholicism, as Wilde had done earlier. More than a decade after Wilde's death, with the release of suppressed portions of Wilde's ''De Profundis'' letter in 1912, Douglas turned against his former friend, whose homosexuality he grew to condemn. He was a defence witness in the libel case brought by [[Maud Allan]] against [[Noel Pemberton Billing]] in 1918. Billing had accused Allan, who was performing Wilde's play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'', of being part of a homosexual conspiracy to undermine the war effort.\n\nDouglas also contributed to Billing's journal ''Vigilante'' as part of his campaign against Robbie Ross. He had written a poem referring to [[Margot Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith|Margot Asquith]] \"bound with Lesbian fillets\" while her husband [[H. H. Asquith|Herbert]], the Prime Minister, gave money to Ross.<ref>Philip Hoare. (1999). ''Oscar Wilde\u2019s Last Stand: Decadence, Conspiracy, and the Most Outrageous Trial of the Century''. Arcade Publishing, p.&nbsp;110.</ref> During the trial he described Wilde as \"the greatest force for evil that has appeared in Europe during the last three hundred and fifty years\". Douglas added that he intensely regretted having met Wilde, and having helped him with the translation of ''Salome'', which he described as \"a most pernicious and abominable piece of work\".\n\n==''Plain English''==\n\nIn 1920 Douglas founded a [[Far-right politics|right-wing]], Catholic, and \"deeply anti-Jewish\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Toczek|title=Haters, Baiters and Would-Be Dictators: Anti-Semitism and the UK Far Right|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=2015|isbn=978-1138853485|page=239}}</ref> weekly magazine called ''Plain English'', on which he collaborated with [[Harold Sherwood Spencer]], and to begin with [[Thomas William Hodgson Crosland]]. It regarded itself as the successor to ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]'', to which Douglas had been a contributing editor. ''Plain English'' ran until the end of 1922. Douglas later admitted that its policy was \"strongly anti-Semitic\".<ref>The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas (1929) p. 302</ref><ref>Brown, William Sorley ''The Life and Genius of T.W.H. Crosland'' (1928) p394</ref>\n\nFrom August 1920 (issue No 8) ''Plain English'' began publishing a long running series of articles called \"The Jewish Peril\" by [[Arthur Cherep-Spiridovich|Major-General Count Cherep-Spiridovitch]] the title of which was taken from the fore-title of [[George Shanks]]' version of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. ''Plain English'' advertised (from issue 20) [[The Britons]]' second edition of Shank's version of the ''Protocols''. Douglas challenged the ''Jewish Guardian'', published by the [[League of British Jews]], to take him to court suggesting they would not as they were \"well aware of the absolute truth of the allegations which we have made\".<ref>The \"Jewish Guardian\" Again, ''Plain English'' No 21, 27 November 1920</ref> The magazine suggested in 1921, \"we need a [[Ku Klux Klan]] in this country\",<ref>Lies, ''Plain English'' No 66, 8 October 1921</ref> but a promotion for ''[[Ostara (magazine)|Ostara]]'' magazine was generally not well received by readers.\n\nOther regular targets of the magazine included [[David Lloyd George]], [[Lord Northcliffe|Alfred Viscount Northcliffe]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Frank Harris]], and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]. In December 1920 the magazine was the first to publish the secret constitution of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].\n\nFrom 25 December 1920 it began publishing regularly its most notorious series of articles alleging that a \"powerful individual in the Admiralty\" had alerted the Germans at the [[Battle of Jutland]] that the British had broken their code, and that [[Winston Churchill]] had falsified a report in return for a large sum of money from [[Ernest Cassel]] who thereby profited; in May 1921 Douglas would also insinuate that [[Herbert Kitchener|Herbert Earl Kitchener]] had been murdered by the Jews.<ref>{{cite book|first=Stephen|last=Heathorn|title=Haig and Kitchener in Twentieth-Century Britain: Remembrance, Representation and Appropriation|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=2016|isbn=978-0754669654|pages=68\u201372}}</ref>\n\nDouglas ceased to be editor after issue 67 in 1921 after a row with Spencer.<ref>Toczek, p. 34</ref> He then produced a short lived, almost identical, rival magazine called ''Plain Speech'' in 1921 with [[Herbert Moore Pim]]. Its first issue contained a letter from a correspondent in Germany praising \"[[Adolf Hitler|Herr Hittler]]\" (as spelled in original) and \"[[Nazi Party|The German White Labour Party]]\".\n\nDouglas's view of a Jewish plot was nuanced. In 1920 he would, whilst recognizing \"the Jewish Peril\", noted that \"Christian Charity forbids us to join in wholesale and indiscriminate abuse and vilification of an entire race\".<ref>Christian Charity and the Jews, ''Plain English'' No. 4, 31 July 1920, p. 78</ref> In 1921 he would state it was not acceptable to \"shift responsibility\" onto the Jews.<ref>\"The Jews, 'The Britons' and the ''Morning Post''\", ''Plain Speech'' No. 10, 24 December 1921, p. 149</ref> In his ''Autobiography'' in 1929 he wrote, \"I feel now that it is ridiculous to make accusations against the Jews, attributing them qualities and methods which are really much more typically English than Jewish\", and then indicated the country had only itself to blame if the Jews came in and trampled on it.<ref>''The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas'' (1929) pp. 303\u2013304</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Colin Holmes (historian)|Colin Holmes]] indicated that while \"Douglas had been to the forefront of anti-semitism in the early 1920s, he was quite unable to come to terms with the vicious racist anti-semitism in Germany\" under the Nazis.<ref>Holmes, Colin ''Anti-Semitism in British Society, 1876\u20131939'' Routledge (1979) p. 218</ref> Politically he described himself as \"a strong Conservative of the 'Diehard' variety\".<ref>The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas (1929) p220</ref>\n\n==Libel actions==\nDouglas started his \"litigious and libellous career\" by obtaining an apology and fifty guineas each from the Oxford and Cambridge university magazines ''[[Isis magazine|Isis]]'' and ''Cambridge'' for defamatory references to him in an article on Wilde.<ref>(Murray p&nbsp;152)</ref>\n\nDouglas was either plaintiff or defendant in several trials for civil or [[criminal libel]]. In 1913 he was charged with libelling his father-in-law. Also in 1913 he accused [[Arthur Ransome]] of libelling him in his book ''Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study''. He saw this trial as a weapon against his enemy Ross, not understanding that Ross would not be called to give evidence. The court found in Ransome's favour and Douglas was bankrupted by the failed libel suit.<ref>[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/Edinburgh/issue/12530/page/77 The Edinburgh Gazette Publication date:17 January 1913 Issue: 12530, Page 77]</ref> Ransome did remove the offending passages from the second edition of his book.<ref>Ransome, Arthur, ''Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study'', 2nd edition, Methuen, 1913</ref>\n\nIn the most noted case, brought by the Crown on Winston Churchill's behalf in 1923, Douglas was found guilty of libelling Churchill and was sentenced to six months in prison. Churchill had been accused as cabinet minister, of falsifying an official report on the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916 when, although suffering losses, the Royal Navy drove the German battle fleet off the high seas. Churchill was said to have reported that the British navy had in fact, been defeated; the motive was supposed to be that when this news was flashed, the prices of British securities would tumble on the world's stock exchanges, allowing a group of named Jewish financiers to snap them up cheaply. Churchill's reward was a houseful of furniture, valued at [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]40,000.\n\nThe allegations were made by Douglas in his journal ''Plain English'' and later at a public meeting in London. A false report of a crushing British naval defeat had indeed been planted in the New York press by German interests but by this time (following the failure of his [[Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign|Dardanelles Campaign]]), Churchill was not connected with the Admiralty. As the attorney general asserted in court, on Churchill's behalf, there was \"no plot, no phoney communiqu\u00e9, no stock market raid and no present of fine furniture\".<ref>http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,727630,00.html accessed 10/2/2017</ref><ref>http://www.jta.org/1923/12/13/archive/churchill-wins-libel-suit-against-douglas accessed 10/2/2017</ref>\n\nIn 1924, while in prison, Douglas, in an echo of Wilde's composition of ''De Profundis'' ([[Latin]] for \"From the Depths\") during his incarceration, wrote his last major poetic work, ''In Excelsis'' (In the Highest), which contains 17 [[canto]]s. Since the prison authorities would not allow Douglas to take the manuscript with him when he was released, he had to rewrite the work from memory. Douglas maintained that his health never recovered from his harsh prison ordeal, which included sleeping on a plank bed without a mattress.\n\n==Later life==\nFollowing his incarceration in 1924, Douglas's feelings towards Wilde began to soften. He wrote in ''Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up'' that \"Sometimes a sin is also a crime (for example, a murder or theft), but this is not the case with homosexuality, any more than with adultery\".<ref>(Murray pp 309\u2013310)</ref> Throughout the 1930s and until his death Douglas maintained correspondence with many people, including [[Marie Stopes]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]]. [[Anthony Wynn]] wrote the play ''Bernard and Bosie: A Most Unlikely Friendship'' based on the letters between Shaw and Douglas. One of Douglas's final public appearances was his well-received lecture to the [[Royal Society of Literature]] on 2 September 1943, entitled ''The Principles of Poetry'', which was published in an edition of 1,000 copies. He attacked the poetry of [[T. S. Eliot]] and the talk was praised by [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]] and [[Augustus John]].<ref>(Murray pp 318\u2013319)</ref>\n\nDouglas's only child, Raymond, was diagnosed with [[schizoaffective disorder]] in 1927, at the age of 24 and entered [[St Andrew's Hospital]], a mental institution. He was decertified and discharged after five years but suffered another breakdown and returned to the hospital. In February 1944, when his mother died of a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] at the age of 70, Raymond was able to attend her funeral and in June he was again decertified. His conduct rapidly deteriorated and he returned to St Andrew's in November. He stayed there until his death on 10 October 1964.

Douglas\u2019 father, the [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]], disapproved strongly of the affair, and set out to humiliate Wilde, publicly accusing him of homosexuality. Wilde sued him for criminal [[libel]], but some of his intimate notes were discovered, and he was duly jailed. On his release, Wilde briefly lived with Douglas in Naples, but they were separated by the time Wilde died in 1900.\n\nDouglas married [[Olive Custance]] in 1902, and they produced a son, Raymond. Converting to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1911, he openly repudiated Wilde\u2019s homosexuality, and in a High-Catholic magazine, ''Plain English'', he expressed views that were openly [[anti-Semitic]], though he rejected the policies of [[Nazi Germany]]. He was also jailed for libeling [[Winston Churchill]] over claims of wartime misconduct.\n\nDouglas wrote several books of verse, some of it classified in the homoerotic [[Uranian poetry|Uranian]] genre. The phrase \"The love that dare not speak its name\" came from one of Douglas\u2019 poems, though it is widely misattributed to Wilde.\n\n==Early life and background==\n[[File:JohnSholtoDouglasMarquessofQueensberry.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|The 9th Marquess of Queensberry]]]]\nDouglas was born at Ham Hill House in [[Powick]], [[Worcestershire]], the third son of [[The Most Honourable|The Most Hon.]] [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry]] and his first wife, Sibyl Montgomery.\n\nHe was his mother's favourite child; she called him Bosie (a derivative of \"boysie\", as in boy), a nickname which stuck for the rest of his life.<ref name=odnb>{{cite ODNB|id=32869|title=Douglas, Lord Alfred Bruce (1870\u20131945)}}</ref> His mother successfully sued for divorce in 1887 on the grounds of his father's adultery.<ref>\"The Queensberry Divorce Case\", ''The Times'', 24 January 1887, p. 4</ref> The [[Marquess]] married Ethel Weeden in 1893 but the marriage was annulled the following year.\n\nDouglas was educated at [[Wixenford School]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Rupert|last=Croft-Cooke|title=Bosie: The Story of Lord Alfred Douglas, His Friends and Enemies|publisher=[[Bobbs-Merrill Company]]|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|date=1963|isbn=978-1299419407|page=33}}</ref> [[Winchester College]] (1884\u201388) and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] (1889\u201393), which he left without obtaining a degree.

Their relationship had always been a strained one and, during the Queensberry-Wilde feud, Douglas sided with Wilde, even encouraging Wilde to prosecute the Marquess for libel.

Montgomery Hyde, ''The Love That Dared not Speak its Name;'' p.144</ref><ref>Ellmann (1988:98)</ref> In 1894, the [[Robert Smythe Hichens|Robert Hichens]] novel ''[[The Green Carnation]]'' was published. Said to be a ''[[roman \u00e0 clef]]'' based on the relationship of Wilde and Douglas, it was one of the texts used against Wilde during his trials in 1895.\n\nDouglas has been described as spoiled, reckless, insolent and extravagant. He would spend money on men and gambling and expected Wilde to contribute to funding his tastes. They often argued and broke up, but would also always reconcile.\n\nDouglas had praised Wilde's play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' in the Oxford magazine, ''The Spirit Lamp'', of which he was editor (and used as a covert means of gaining acceptance for homosexuality). Wilde had originally written ''Salom\u00e9'' in French, and in 1893 he commissioned Douglas to translate it into English. Douglas's French was very poor and his translation was highly criticised; for example, a passage that runs \"''On ne doit regarder que dans les miroirs''\" (\"One should look only in mirrors\") he rendered  \"One must not look at mirrors\". Douglas was angered at Wilde's criticism, and  claimed that the errors were in fact in Wilde's original play. This led to a hiatus in the relationship and a row between the two men, with angry messages being exchanged and even the involvement of the publisher [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]] and the illustrator [[Aubrey Beardsley]] when they themselves objected to Douglas's work. Beardsley complained to [[Robbie Ross]]: \"For one week the numbers of telegraph and messenger boys who came to the door was simply scandalous\". Wilde redid much of the translation himself, but, in a gesture of reconciliation, suggested that Douglas be dedicated as the translator rather than credited, along with him, on the title-page. Accepting this, Douglas, somewhat vainly, likened a dedication to sharing the title-page as \"the difference between a tribute of admiration from an artist and a receipt from a tradesman\".<ref name=\"Ellmann\" />\n\nIn 1894, Douglas came and visited Oscar Wilde in Worthing, much to the consternation of the latter's wife Constance.<ref>Antony Edmunds, ''Oscar Wilde's Scandalous Summer;'' p.26 [http://www.oscarwilde.org.uk/chapter-1.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181128075207/http://www.oscarwilde.org.uk/chapter-1.html |date=28 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\nOn another occasion, while staying with Wilde in [[Brighton]], Douglas fell ill with influenza and was nursed by Wilde, but failed to return the favour when Wilde himself fell ill in consequence. Instead Douglas moved to the [[Grand Hotel (Brighton)|Grand Hotel]] and, on Wilde's 40th birthday, sent him a letter saying that he had charged him the bill. Douglas also gave his old clothes to male prostitutes, but failed to remove from the pockets incriminating letters exchanged between him and Wilde, which were then used for [[blackmail]].<ref name=\"Ellmann\">''Oscar Wilde'' by Richard Ellman, published in 1987</ref>\n\nAlfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, suspected the liaison to be more than a friendship. He sent his son a letter, attacking him for leaving Oxford without a degree and failing to take up a proper career. He threatened to \"disown [Alfred] and stop all money supplies\". Alfred responded with a telegram stating: \"What a funny little man you are\".\n\nQueensberry's next letter threatened his son with a \"thrashing\" and accused him of being \"crazy\". He also threatened to \"make a public scandal in a way you little dream of\" if he continued his relationship with Wilde.\n\nQueensberry was well known for his temper and threatening to beat people with a horsewhip. Alfred sent his father a postcard stating \"I detest you\" and making it clear that he would take Wilde's side in a fight between him and the Marquess, \"with a loaded revolver\".\n\nIn answer Queensberry wrote to Alfred (whom he addressed as \"You miserable creature\") that he had divorced Alfred's mother in order not to \"run the risk of bringing more creatures into the world like yourself\" and that, when Alfred was a baby, \"I cried over you the bitterest tears a man ever shed, that I had brought such a creature into the world, and unwittingly committed such a crime&nbsp;... You must be demented\".\n\nWhen Douglas's eldest brother [[Francis Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig|Francis Viscount Drumlanrig]] died in a suspicious hunting accident in October 1894, rumours circulated that he had been having a homosexual relationship with the Prime Minister, [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]], and that the cause of death was suicide. The Marquess of Queensberry thus embarked on a campaign to save his other son, and began a public persecution of Wilde. Wilde had been openly flamboyant, and his actions made the public suspicious even before the trial.<ref>Ellmann (1988:101)</ref> He and a minder confronted the playwright in his own home; later, Queensberry planned to throw rotten vegetables at Wilde during the premiere of ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', but, forewarned of this, the playwright was able to deny him access to the theatre.\n\nQueensberry then publicly insulted Wilde by leaving, at the latter's club, a [[visiting card]] on which he had written: \"For Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite {{sic}}\". The wording is in dispute \u2013 the handwriting is unclear \u2013 although Hyde reports it as this. According to [[Merlin Holland]], Wilde's grandson, it is more likely \"Posing somdomite\", while Queensberry himself claimed it to be \"Posing as somdomite\". Holland suggests that this wording (\"posing [as] ...\") would have been easier to defend in court.\n\n==The 1895 trials==\n{{Main|Oscar Wilde#Trials|l1=Oscar Wilde \u2013 Trials}}\nIn response to this card, and with Douglas's avid support, but against the advice of friends such as [[Robbie Ross]], [[Frank Harris]], and [[George Bernard Shaw]], Wilde had Queensberry arrested and charged with criminal [[libel]] in a [[private prosecution]], as [[sodomy]] was then a criminal offence. According to libel laws of the time, since his authorship of the charge of sodomy was not in question, Queensberry could avoid conviction only by demonstrating in court not only that the charge he had made was factually true, but that there was also some public interest in having made the charge publicly. [[Edward Carson]], Queensberry's lawyer, accordingly portrayed Wilde as a vicious older man who habitually preyed upon naive young boys and, with extravagant gifts and promises of a glamorous lifestyle, seduced them into a life of homosexuality. Several highly suggestive erotic letters that Wilde had written to Douglas were introduced into evidence; Wilde claimed they were works of art. Wilde was closely questioned about the homoerotic themes in ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' and in ''The Chameleon'', a single-issue magazine published by Douglas to which Wilde had contributed his 'Phrases and Philosophies for Use of the Young'.\n\n[[File:Somdomite.jpg|thumb|The calling card in question, labelled Exhibit A in the trial (bottom left corner)|left]]Queensberry's attorney announced in court that he had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. Wilde's lawyers advised him that this would make a conviction on the libel charge very unlikely; he then dropped the libel charge, on his lawyers' advice, to avoid further pointless scandal. Without a conviction, the libel law of the time left Wilde liable to pay Queensberry's considerable legal costs, leaving him [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]].\n\nBased on the evidence raised during the case, Wilde was arrested the next day and charged with committing criminal [[sodomy]] and \"[[gross indecency between men|gross indecency]]\", a charge only capable of being committed by two men and which covered sexual acts other than sodomy.\n\nDouglas's September 1892 poem \"[[s:Two Loves (1894 poem)|Two Loves]]\" (published in the Oxford magazine ''The Chameleon'' in December 1894), which was used against Wilde at the latter's trial, ends with the famous line that refers to homosexuality as ''[[the love that dare not speak its name]]'', a quote often falsely attributed to Wilde. Wilde gave an eloquent but counterproductive explanation of the nature of this love on the witness stand. The trial resulted in a [[hung jury]].\n\nIn 1895, when during his trials Wilde was released on bail, Douglas's cousin [[Sholto Johnstone Douglas]] stood [[surety]] for [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]500 of the bail money.<ref>Borland, Maureen, ''Wilde's Devoted Friend: A Life of Robert Ross, 1869\u20131918'' (Lennard Publishing, 1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=j2lnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Sholto+Johnstone+Douglas%22&dq=%22Sholto+Johnstone+Douglas%22&ei=j1R5SfWUMpWyyQS4kNSwBg&pgis=1 p. 206] at books.google.com, accessed 22 January 2009</ref> The prosecutor opted to retry the case. Wilde was convicted on 25 May 1895 and sentenced to two years' [[hard labour]], first at [[HM Prison Pentonville|Pentonville]], then [[HM Prison Wandsworth|Wandsworth]], then famously in [[HM Prison Reading|Reading Gaol]]. Douglas was forced into exile in Europe.\n\nWhile in prison, Wilde wrote Douglas a long and critical letter titled ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]'', describing exactly what he felt about him, which Wilde was not permitted to send, but which may or may not have been sent to Douglas after Wilde's release: it was given to Robbie Ross, with the instructions to make a copy and send the original to Lord Alfred Douglas. Lord Alfred Douglas later said that he received only a letter from Ross with a few choice quotes, and didn't know there was a letter until reference was made to it in a biography of Wilde's on which Ross consulted. Following Wilde's release (on 19 May 1897), the two reunited in August at [[Rouen]], but stayed together only a few months owing to personal differences and the various pressures on them.\n\n==Naples and Paris==\nThe meeting in Rouen was disapproved of by the friends and families of both men. During the later part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together in Naples, but because of financial pressures and for other personal reasons, they separated. Wilde spent the remainder of his life primarily in Paris, and Douglas returned to Britain in late 1898.\n\nThe period when the two men lived in Naples later became controversial. Wilde claimed that Douglas had offered a home, but had no funds or ideas. When Douglas eventually did gain funds from his late father's estate, he refused to grant Wilde a permanent allowance, although he did give him occasional handouts. When Wilde died in 1900, he was still bankrupt. Douglas served as chief mourner, although there reportedly was an altercation at the grave between him and Robbie Ross. This struggle developed into a feud<ref>{{cite book|title=World Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvwIAQAAIAAJ|year=1970|publisher=E. Hulton}}</ref> which foreshadowed the later litigations between the two former lovers of Wilde.\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Lady-alfred-douglas.jpg|thumb|upright|Lady Alfred Douglas]]\nAfter Wilde's death, Douglas established a close friendship with [[Olive Custance]], a [[bisexual]] heiress and poet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Sarah|title='A Girl's Love': Lord Alfred Douglas as Homoerotic Muse in the Poetry of Olive Custance|journal=Women: A Cultural Review|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|location=London, England|date=September 2011|volume=22|issue=2\u20133|pages=220\u2013240|doi=10.1080/09574042.2011.585045|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/22672}}</ref> They married on 4 March 1902.

They separated in 1913, lived together for a time in the 1920s after Custance also converted, and then lived apart after she gave up Catholicism. The health of their only child further strained the marriage, which by the end of the 1920s was all but over, although they never divorced.\n\n==Repudiation of Wilde==\nIn 1911, Douglas embraced Roman Catholicism, as Wilde had done earlier. More than a decade after Wilde's death, with the release of suppressed portions of Wilde's ''De Profundis'' letter in 1912, Douglas turned against his former friend, whose homosexuality he grew to condemn. He was a defence witness in the libel case brought by [[Maud Allan]] against [[Noel Pemberton Billing]] in 1918. Billing had accused Allan, who was performing Wilde's play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'', of being part of a homosexual conspiracy to undermine the war effort.\n\nDouglas also contributed to Billing's journal ''Vigilante'' as part of his campaign against Robbie Ross. He had written a poem referring to [[Margot Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith|Margot Asquith]] \"bound with Lesbian fillets\" while her husband [[H. H. Asquith|Herbert]], the Prime Minister, gave money to Ross.<ref>Philip Hoare. (1999). ''Oscar Wilde\u2019s Last Stand: Decadence, Conspiracy, and the Most Outrageous Trial of the Century''. Arcade Publishing, p.&nbsp;110.</ref> During the trial he described Wilde as \"the greatest force for evil that has appeared in Europe during the last three hundred and fifty years\". Douglas added that he intensely regretted having met Wilde, and having helped him with the translation of ''Salome'', which he described as \"a most pernicious and abominable piece of work\".\n\n==''Plain English''==\n\nIn 1920 Douglas founded a [[Far-right politics|right-wing]], Catholic, and \"deeply anti-Jewish\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Toczek|title=Haters, Baiters and Would-Be Dictators: Anti-Semitism and the UK Far Right|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=2015|isbn=978-1138853485|page=239}}</ref> weekly magazine called ''Plain English'', on which he collaborated with [[Harold Sherwood Spencer]], and to begin with [[Thomas William Hodgson Crosland]]. It regarded itself as the successor to ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]'', to which Douglas had been a contributing editor. ''Plain English'' ran until the end of 1922. Douglas later admitted that its policy was \"strongly anti-Semitic\".<ref>The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas (1929) p. 302</ref><ref>Brown, William Sorley ''The Life and Genius of T.W.H. Crosland'' (1928) p394</ref>\n\nFrom August 1920 (issue No 8) ''Plain English'' began publishing a long running series of articles called \"The Jewish Peril\" by [[Arthur Cherep-Spiridovich|Major-General Count Cherep-Spiridovitch]] the title of which was taken from the fore-title of [[George Shanks]]' version of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. ''Plain English'' advertised (from issue 20) [[The Britons]]' second edition of Shank's version of the ''Protocols''. Douglas challenged the ''Jewish Guardian'', published by the [[League of British Jews]], to take him to court suggesting they would not as they were \"well aware of the absolute truth of the allegations which we have made\".<ref>The \"Jewish Guardian\" Again, ''Plain English'' No 21, 27 November 1920</ref> The magazine suggested in 1921, \"we need a [[Ku Klux Klan]] in this country\",<ref>Lies, ''Plain English'' No 66, 8 October 1921</ref> but a promotion for ''[[Ostara (magazine)|Ostara]]'' magazine was generally not well received by readers.\n\nOther regular targets of the magazine included [[David Lloyd George]], [[Lord Northcliffe|Alfred Viscount Northcliffe]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Frank Harris]], and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]. In December 1920 the magazine was the first to publish the secret constitution of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].\n\nFrom 25 December 1920 it began publishing regularly its most notorious series of articles alleging that a \"powerful individual in the Admiralty\" had alerted the Germans at the [[Battle of Jutland]] that the British had broken their code, and that [[Winston Churchill]] had falsified a report in return for a large sum of money from [[Ernest Cassel]] who thereby profited; in May 1921 Douglas would also insinuate that [[Herbert Kitchener|Herbert Earl Kitchener]] had been murdered by the Jews.<ref>{{cite book|first=Stephen|last=Heathorn|title=Haig and Kitchener in Twentieth-Century Britain: Remembrance, Representation and Appropriation|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=2016|isbn=978-0754669654|pages=68\u201372}}</ref>\n\nDouglas ceased to be editor after issue 67 in 1921 after a row with Spencer.<ref>Toczek, p. 34</ref> He then produced a short lived, almost identical, rival magazine called ''Plain Speech'' in 1921 with [[Herbert Moore Pim]]. Its first issue contained a letter from a correspondent in Germany praising \"[[Adolf Hitler|Herr Hittler]]\" (as spelled in original) and \"[[Nazi Party|The German White Labour Party]]\".\n\nDouglas's view of a Jewish plot was nuanced. In 1920 he would, whilst recognizing \"the Jewish Peril\", noted that \"Christian Charity forbids us to join in wholesale and indiscriminate abuse and vilification of an entire race\".<ref>Christian Charity and the Jews, ''Plain English'' No. 4, 31 July 1920, p. 78</ref> In 1921 he would state it was not acceptable to \"shift responsibility\" onto the Jews.<ref>\"The Jews, 'The Britons' and the ''Morning Post''\", ''Plain Speech'' No. 10, 24 December 1921, p. 149</ref> In his ''Autobiography'' in 1929 he wrote, \"I feel now that it is ridiculous to make accusations against the Jews, attributing them qualities and methods which are really much more typically English than Jewish\", and then indicated the country had only itself to blame if the Jews came in and trampled on it.<ref>''The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas'' (1929) pp. 303\u2013304</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Colin Holmes (historian)|Colin Holmes]] indicated that while \"Douglas had been to the forefront of anti-semitism in the early 1920s, he was quite unable to come to terms with the vicious racist anti-semitism in Germany\" under the Nazis.<ref>Holmes, Colin ''Anti-Semitism in British Society, 1876\u20131939'' Routledge (1979) p. 218</ref> Politically he described himself as \"a strong Conservative of the 'Diehard' variety\".<ref>The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas (1929) p220</ref>\n\n==Libel actions==\nDouglas started his \"litigious and libellous career\" by obtaining an apology and fifty guineas each from the Oxford and Cambridge university magazines ''[[Isis magazine|Isis]]'' and ''Cambridge'' for defamatory references to him in an article on Wilde.<ref>(Murray p&nbsp;152)</ref>\n\nDouglas was either plaintiff or defendant in several trials for civil or [[criminal libel]]. In 1913 he was charged with libelling his father-in-law. Also in 1913 he accused [[Arthur Ransome]] of libelling him in his book ''Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study''. He saw this trial as a weapon against his enemy Ross, not understanding that Ross would not be called to give evidence. The court found in Ransome's favour and Douglas was bankrupted by the failed libel suit.<ref>[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/Edinburgh/issue/12530/page/77 The Edinburgh Gazette Publication date:17 January 1913 Issue: 12530, Page 77]</ref> Ransome did remove the offending passages from the second edition of his book.<ref>Ransome, Arthur, ''Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study'', 2nd edition, Methuen, 1913</ref>\n\nIn the most noted case, brought by the Crown on Winston Churchill's behalf in 1923, Douglas was found guilty of libelling Churchill and was sentenced to six months in prison. Churchill had been accused as cabinet minister, of falsifying an official report on the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916 when, although suffering losses, the Royal Navy drove the German battle fleet off the high seas. Churchill was said to have reported that the British navy had in fact, been defeated; the motive was supposed to be that when this news was flashed, the prices of British securities would tumble on the world's stock exchanges, allowing a group of named Jewish financiers to snap them up cheaply. Churchill's reward was a houseful of furniture, valued at [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]40,000.\n\nThe allegations were made by Douglas in his journal ''Plain English'' and later at a public meeting in London. A false report of a crushing British naval defeat had indeed been planted in the New York press by German interests but by this time (following the failure of his [[Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign|Dardanelles Campaign]]), Churchill was not connected with the Admiralty. As the attorney general asserted in court, on Churchill's behalf, there was \"no plot, no phoney communiqu\u00e9, no stock market raid and no present of fine furniture\".<ref>http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,727630,00.html accessed 10/2/2017</ref><ref>http://www.jta.org/1923/12/13/archive/churchill-wins-libel-suit-against-douglas accessed 10/2/2017</ref>\n\nIn 1924, while in prison, Douglas, in an echo of Wilde's composition of ''De Profundis'' ([[Latin]] for \"From the Depths\") during his incarceration, wrote his last major poetic work, ''In Excelsis'' (In the Highest), which contains 17 [[canto]]s. Since the prison authorities would not allow Douglas to take the manuscript with him when he was released, he had to rewrite the work from memory. Douglas maintained that his health never recovered from his harsh prison ordeal, which included sleeping on a plank bed without a mattress.\n\n==Later life==\nFollowing his incarceration in 1924, Douglas's feelings towards Wilde began to soften. He wrote in ''Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up'' that \"Sometimes a sin is also a crime (for example, a murder or theft), but this is not the case with homosexuality, any more than with adultery\".<ref>(Murray pp 309\u2013310)</ref> Throughout the 1930s and until his death Douglas maintained correspondence with many people, including [[Marie Stopes]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]]. [[Anthony Wynn]] wrote the play ''Bernard and Bosie: A Most Unlikely Friendship'' based on the letters between Shaw and Douglas. One of Douglas's final public appearances was his well-received lecture to the [[Royal Society of Literature]] on 2 September 1943, entitled ''The Principles of Poetry'', which was published in an edition of 1,000 copies. He attacked the poetry of [[T. S. Eliot]] and the talk was praised by [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]] and [[Augustus John]].<ref>(Murray pp 318\u2013319)</ref>\n\nDouglas's only child, Raymond, was diagnosed with [[schizoaffective disorder]] in 1927, at the age of 24 and entered [[St Andrew's Hospital]], a mental institution. He was decertified and discharged after five years but suffered another breakdown and returned to the hospital. In February 1944, when his mother died of a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] at the age of 70, Raymond was able to attend her funeral and in June he was again decertified. His conduct rapidly deteriorated and he returned to St Andrew's in November. He stayed there until his death on 10 October 1964. He never married.<ref>[http://www.anthonywynn.com/bosietimeline/ \"Timeline to the Life of Lord Alfred 'Bosie' Douglas\" anthonywynn.com] Retrieved 24 August 2011</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Lord Alfred Douglas grave.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Douglas' gravestone|The grave of Alfred Douglas (and mother) at the [[Friary Church of St Francis and St Anthony, Crawley]], Sussex, pictured in 2013]]\nDouglas died of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Lancing, West Sussex|Lancing]], Sussex, on 20 March 1945 at the age of 74.

Wilson in ''The Telegraph'' 26 November 2001]</ref>\n\n==Writings==\nDouglas published several volumes of poetry; two books about his relationship with Wilde, ''Oscar Wilde and Myself'' (1914, largely ghostwritten by [[Thomas William Hodgson Crosland|T. W. H. Crosland]], the assistant editor of ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]'' and later repudiated by Douglas), ''Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up'' (1940) and two memoirs, ''The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas'' (1929) and ''Without Apology'' (1938).\n\nDouglas also was the editor of a literary journal, ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]'', from 1907 to 1910 and during this time he had an affair with artist [[Romaine Brooks]], who was also [[bisexual]] (the main love of her life, [[Natalie Clifford Barney]], also had an affair with Wilde's niece [[Dorothy Wilde|Dorothy]] and even, in 1901, with Douglas's future wife [[Olive Custance]], the year before the couple married).\n\nThere are six biographies of Douglas. The earlier ones by Braybrooke and Freeman were not allowed to quote from Douglas's copyright work and ''De Profundis'' was unpublished. Later biographies were by Rupert Croft-Cooke, [[H. Montgomery Hyde]] (who also wrote about Wilde), [[Douglas Murray (author)|Douglas Murray]] (who describes Braybrooke's biography as \"a rehash and exaggeration of Douglas's book\" [his autobiography]).
