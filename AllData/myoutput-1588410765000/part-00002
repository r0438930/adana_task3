The majority of posts along the LOC were adjacent to the highway, and therefore the recapture of nearly every infiltrated post increased both the territorial gains and the security of the highway. The protection of this route and the recapture of the forward posts were thus ongoing objectives throughout the war.\n\nThe Indian Army's first priority was to recapture peaks that were in the immediate vicinity of NH 1. This resulted in Indian troops first targeting the Tiger Hill and Tololing complex in Dras, which dominated the Srinagar-Leh route.<ref name=frankcass>{{cite book|title=Managing Armed Conflicts in the 21st Century|publisher=Frank Cass Publishers|location=London|isbn=0714681369|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKF05qekf9gC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|editor=Adekeye Adebajo and Chandra Lekha Sriram|pages=192\u2013193|year=2001}}</ref> This was soon followed by the Batalik-Turtok sub-sector which provided access to [[Siachen Glacier]]. Some of the peaks that were of vital strategic importance to the Pakistani defensive troops were Point 4590 and [[Point 5353]].

The [[Battle of Tololing]], amongst other assaults, slowly tilted the combat in India's favour. The Pakistani troops at Tololing were aided by Pakistani fighters from Kashmir. Some of the posts put up a stiff resistance, including Tiger Hill (Point 5140) that fell only later in the war. Indian troops found well-entrenched Pakistani soldiers at Tiger Hill, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. After a final assault on the peak in which ten Pakistani soldiers and five Indian soldiers were killed, Tiger Hill finally fell. A few of the assaults occurred atop hitherto unheard of peaks \u2013 most of them unnamed with only Point numbers to differentiate them \u2013 which witnessed fierce [[hand to hand combat]].\n\nAs the operation was fully underway, about 250 artillery guns were brought in to clear the infiltrators in the posts that were in the [[wikt:line of sight|line-of-sight]]. The [[Bofors]] [[Haubits FH77/A|FH-77B field howitzer]] played a vital role, with Indian gunners making maximum use of the terrain. However, its success was limited elsewhere due to the lack of space and depth to deploy it.\n\nThe [[Indian Air Force]] was tasked to act jointly with [[ground troops]] on 25 May.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The [[code name]] assigned to their role was [[Operation Safed Sagar]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indianairforce.nic.in/content/op-safed-sagar|title=Op Safed Sagar &#124; Indian Air Force &#124; Government of India|website=indianairforce.nic.in}}</ref> It was in this type of terrain that [[Aerial warfare|aerial attacks]] were used, initially with limited effectiveness.

The Indian Army mounted some direct frontal ground assaults which were slow and took a heavy toll given the steep ascent that had to be made on peaks as high as {{convert|18000|ft|order=flip}}. Since any daylight attack would be suicidal, all the advances had to be made under the cover of darkness, escalating the risk of freezing. Accounting for the [[wind chill]] factor, the temperatures were often as low as {{cvt|-15|to|-11|C|}} near the mountain tops. Based on [[military tactics]], much of the costly [[frontal assault]]s by the Indians could have been avoided if the Indian Military had chosen to blockade the supply route of the opposing force, creating a [[siege]]. Such a move would have involved the Indian troops crossing the LOC as well as initiating aerial attacks on Pakistani soil, however, a manoeuvre India was not willing to exercise due to the likely expansion of the [[Theater (warfare)|theatre of war]] and reduced international support for its cause.\n\nTwo months into the conflict, Indian troops had slowly retaken most of the ridges that were encroached upon by the infiltrators;<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"Colonel Ravi Nanda 1999\"/> according to the official count, an estimated 75\u201380% of the intruded area and nearly all the high ground were back under Indian control.<ref name=\"VP Malik\" />\n\n===Withdrawal and final battles===\nFollowing the outbreak of armed fighting, Pakistan sought American help in de-escalating the conflict. [[Bruce Riedel]], who was then an aide to President [[Bill Clinton]], reported that US intelligence had imaged Pakistani movements of nuclear weapons to forward deployments for fear of the Kargil hostilities escalating into a wider conflict. However, President Clinton refused to intervene until Pakistan had removed all forces from the Indian side of the LOC.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1989886.stm |title=Pakistan 'prepared nuclear strike' |publisher=BBC News |date=16 May 2002 |accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref> Following the Washington accord of 4 July 1999, when Sharif agreed to withdraw Pakistani troops, most of the fighting came to a gradual halt, but some Pakistani forces remained in positions on the Indian side of the LOC.

The day has since been marked as ''Kargil Vijay Diwas'' (Kargil Victory Day) in India.

The Indian government ran advertisements in foreign publications including ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' detailing Pakistan's [[State-sponsored terrorism|role in supporting extremists]] in Kashmir in an attempt to garner political support for its position.\n\nAs the war progressed, media coverage of the conflict was more intense in India than in Pakistan.<ref>Rasheeda Bhagat, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1619/16191300.htm \"A different view of Kargil\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202110814/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1619/16191300.htm |date=2 December 2008 }}, Volume 16 \u2013 Issue 19, 11\u201324 Sep 1999 ''[[The Frontline]]''</ref> Many Indian channels showed images from the battle zone in a style reminiscent of [[CNN]]'s coverage of the [[Gulf War]] (one of the shells fired by Pakistan troops even hit a [[Doordarshan]] transmission centre in Kargil; coverage continued, however).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/newsletter/070699/dd070699.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201202918/http://www.indiantelevision.com/newsletter/070699/dd070699.htm|url-status=dead|title=Pak TV ban gets good response|archivedate=1 December 2008}}</ref> Reasons for India's increased coverage included the greater number of privately owned electronic media in India compared to Pakistan and relatively greater [[Media transparency|transparency]] in the [[Mass media in India|Indian media]].

Some analysts believe that Indian media, which was both larger in number and more credible, may have acted as a [[force multiplier]] for the Indian military operation in Kargil and served as a morale booster.<ref name=pib/><ref>Sultan M. Hali, [http://www.defencejournal.com/2000/aug/role-media-war.htm \"The role of media in war\"], ''Defence Journal'', August 2000.</ref> As the fighting intensified, the Pakistani version of events found little backing on the world stage. This helped India gain valuable [[Diplomatic recognition#Other meanings|diplomatic recognition]] for its position.\n\n==WMDs and the nuclear factor==\nSince Pakistan and India each had [[weapons of mass destruction]], many in the international community were concerned that if the Kargil conflict intensified, it could lead to [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Both countries had tested their nuclear capability in 1998 (India conducted its [[Smiling Buddha|first test]] in 1974 while it was Pakistan's first-ever [[Nuclear testing|nuclear test]]). Many [[Pundit (politics)|pundits]] believed the tests to be an indication of the escalating stakes in the scenario in South Asia. When the Kargil conflict started just a year after the nuclear tests, many nations desired to end it before it intensified.\n\nInternational concerns increased when Pakistani [[Foreign Secretary of Pakistan|foreign secretary]] [[Shamshad Ahmad]] made a statement on 31 May warning that an escalation of the limited conflict could lead Pakistan to use \"any weapon\" in its arsenal.<ref>Quoted in News Desk, \"Pakistan May Use Any Weapon\", ''The News'', 31 May 1999.</ref> This was immediately interpreted as a threat of nuclear retaliation by Pakistan in the event of an extended war, and the belief was reinforced when the leader of [[Senate of Pakistan|Pakistan's senate]] noted, \"The purpose\nof developing weapons becomes meaningless if they are not used when they are needed\".<ref>[http://www.nd.edu/~krocinst/ocpapers/op_18_2.pdf Pakistan's Nuclear Weapons Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112015736/http://www.nd.edu/~krocinst/ocpapers/op_18_2.pdf |date=12 November 2008 }}</ref> Many such ambiguous statements from officials of both countries were viewed as warnings of an impending nuclear crisis where the combatants would consider use of their limited nuclear arsenals in \"tactical\" nuclear warfare in the belief that it would not have ended in [[mutual assured destruction]], as could have occurred in a nuclear conflict between the United States and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some experts believe that following nuclear tests in 1998, the Pakistani military was emboldened by its nuclear deterrent to markedly increase coercion against India.<ref>George Perkovich, [http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&id=17967 \"Options Available to the United States to Counter a Nuclear Iran\"], Testimony before the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services]], 1 February 2006.</ref>\n\nThe nature of the India-Pakistan conflict took a more sinister turn when the United States received intelligence that Pakistani nuclear [[warhead]]s were being moved towards the border. Bill Clinton tried to dissuade Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif from nuclear [[brinkmanship]], even threatening Pakistan of dire consequences. According to a [[White House]] official, Sharif seemed to be genuinely surprised by this supposed missile movement and responded that India was probably planning the same. In a May 2000 article, Sanjay Badri-Maharaj claimed that India too had readied at least five nuclear-tipped [[ballistic missile]]s, but could not back up this claim with any official proof.<ref>''India had deployed [[Agni missile system|Agni]] during Kargil'', Article from \"Indian Express\" 19 June 2000</ref>\n\nSensing a deteriorating military scenario, diplomatic isolation, and the risks of a larger conventional and nuclear war, Sharif ordered the Pakistani army to vacate the Kargil heights. He later claimed in his official biography that General Pervez Musharraf had moved nuclear warheads without informing him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/daily/july-2006/6/index16.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223045736/http://www.nation.com.pk/daily/july-2006/6/index16.php|archivedate=23 December 2007|title=Musharraf moved nuclear weapons in Kargil war|work=The Nation|accessdate=27 May 2009}}</ref> Recently however, Pervez Musharraf revealed in his memoirs that Pakistan's nuclear delivery system was not operational during the Kargil war;<ref name=\"Memoirs\" /> something that would have put Pakistan under serious disadvantage if the conflict went nuclear.\n\nThe threat of [[Weapons of mass destruction|WMD]] included [[chemical weapon|chemical]] and even [[biological weapon]]s. Pakistan accused India of using chemical weapons and [[Incendiary device|incendiary weapons]] such as [[napalm]] against the Kashmiri fighters. India, on the other hand, showcased a cache of [[gas mask]]s as proof that Pakistan may have been prepared to use non-conventional weapons. US official and the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]] determined that Pakistani allegations of India using banned chemicals in its bombs were unfounded.<ref>[http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/India/Chemical/2324_2698.html \"NTI: Country Overview\"], [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080820033051/http://nti.org/e_research/profiles/India/Chemical/2324_2698.html Archive] on the [[Wayback Machine]])</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===India===\n\nFrom the end of the war until February 2000, the [[Bombay Stock Exchange|Indian stock market]] rose by more than 30%. The next [[Union budget of India|Indian national budget]] included major increases in military spending.\n\nThere was a surge in patriotism, with many celebrities expressing their support for the Kargil cause.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/0410/india.kargil.html|title=The Spoils of War|date=10 April 2000|work=TIME.com}}</ref> Indians were angered by media reports of the death of pilot [[Ajay Ahuja]], especially after Indian authorities reported that Ahuja had been murdered and his body [[Mutilation|mutilated]] by Pakistani troops.

One month after conclusion of the Kargil War, the [[Atlantique Incident]], in which a [[Pakistan Navy]] plane was shot down by India, briefly reignited fears of a conflict between the two countries.\n\nAfter the war, the Indian government severed ties with Pakistan and increased defence preparedness.

Terms like Kargil \"conflict\", Kargil \"incident\" or the official military assault, \"[[Operation Vijay (1999)|Operation Vijay]]\", were thus preferred. After the end of the war however, the Indian Government increasingly called it the \"Kargil War\", even though there had been no official declaration of war. Other less popularly used names included \"Third Kashmir War\" and Pakistan's codename given to the infiltration: \"Operation Badr\".\n{{refend}}\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521767217&ss=fro Asymmetric Warfare in South Asia: The Cause and Consequences of the 1999 Limited War in Kargil] the CCC Kargil Project.\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/kargil-99.htm Kargil Conflict] (GlobalSecurity.org)\n* [https://www.rand.org/publications/MR/MR1450/ Limited Conflict Under the Nuclear Umbrella] ([[RAND Corporation]])\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090327120658/http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/kargil/war_in_kargil.pdf War in Kargil] (Center for Contemporary Conflict) (PDF)\n* [http://www.jammu-kashmir.com/archives/archives1999/99august05.html Essay on the outcomes of the Kargil War]\n* {{Cite book | author=Stephen P.

The majority of posts along the LOC were adjacent to the highway, and therefore the recapture of nearly every infiltrated post increased both the territorial gains and the security of the highway. The protection of this route and the recapture of the forward posts were thus ongoing objectives throughout the war.\n\nThe Indian Army's first priority was to recapture peaks that were in the immediate vicinity of NH 1.

The [[Battle of Tololing]], amongst other assaults, slowly tilted the combat in India's favour. The Pakistani troops at Tololing were aided by Pakistani fighters from Kashmir. Some of the posts put up a stiff resistance, including Tiger Hill (Point 5140) that fell only later in the war. Indian troops found well-entrenched Pakistani soldiers at Tiger Hill, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. After a final assault on the peak in which ten Pakistani soldiers and five Indian soldiers were killed, Tiger Hill finally fell. A few of the assaults occurred atop hitherto unheard of peaks \u2013 most of them unnamed with only Point numbers to differentiate them \u2013 which witnessed fierce [[hand to hand combat]].\n\nAs the operation was fully underway, about 250 artillery guns were brought in to clear the infiltrators in the posts that were in the [[wikt:line of sight|line-of-sight]]. The [[Bofors]] [[Haubits FH77/A|FH-77B field howitzer]] played a vital role, with Indian gunners making maximum use of the terrain.

The Indian Army mounted some direct frontal ground assaults which were slow and took a heavy toll given the steep ascent that had to be made on peaks as high as {{convert|18000|ft|order=flip}}. Since any daylight attack would be suicidal, all the advances had to be made under the cover of darkness, escalating the risk of freezing. Accounting for the [[wind chill]] factor, the temperatures were often as low as {{cvt|-15|to|-11|C|}} near the mountain tops. Based on [[military tactics]], much of the costly [[frontal assault]]s by the Indians could have been avoided if the Indian Military had chosen to blockade the supply route of the opposing force, creating a [[siege]]. Such a move would have involved the Indian troops crossing the LOC as well as initiating aerial attacks on Pakistani soil, however, a manoeuvre India was not willing to exercise due to the likely expansion of the [[Theater (warfare)|theatre of war]] and reduced international support for its cause.\n\nTwo months into the conflict, Indian troops had slowly retaken most of the ridges that were encroached upon by the infiltrators;<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"Colonel Ravi Nanda 1999\"/> according to the official count, an estimated 75\u201380% of the intruded area and nearly all the high ground were back under Indian control.<ref name=\"VP Malik\" />\n\n===Withdrawal and final battles===\nFollowing the outbreak of armed fighting, Pakistan sought American help in de-escalating the conflict.

Some analysts believe that Indian media, which was both larger in number and more credible, may have acted as a [[force multiplier]] for the Indian military operation in Kargil and served as a morale booster.<ref name=pib/><ref>Sultan M. Hali, [http://www.defencejournal.com/2000/aug/role-media-war.htm \"The role of media in war\"], ''Defence Journal'', August 2000.</ref> As the fighting intensified, the Pakistani version of events found little backing on the world stage. This helped India gain valuable [[Diplomatic recognition#Other meanings|diplomatic recognition]] for its position.\n\n==WMDs and the nuclear factor==\nSince Pakistan and India each had [[weapons of mass destruction]], many in the international community were concerned that if the Kargil conflict intensified, it could lead to [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Both countries had tested their nuclear capability in 1998 (India conducted its [[Smiling Buddha|first test]] in 1974 while it was Pakistan's first-ever [[Nuclear testing|nuclear test]]). Many [[Pundit (politics)|pundits]] believed the tests to be an indication of the escalating stakes in the scenario in South Asia. When the Kargil conflict started just a year after the nuclear tests, many nations desired to end it before it intensified.\n\nInternational concerns increased when Pakistani [[Foreign Secretary of Pakistan|foreign secretary]] [[Shamshad Ahmad]] made a statement on 31 May warning that an escalation of the limited conflict could lead Pakistan to use \"any weapon\" in its arsenal.<ref>Quoted in News Desk, \"Pakistan May Use Any Weapon\", ''The News'', 31 May 1999.</ref> This was immediately interpreted as a threat of nuclear retaliation by Pakistan in the event of an extended war, and the belief was reinforced when the leader of [[Senate of Pakistan|Pakistan's senate]] noted, \"The purpose\nof developing weapons becomes meaningless if they are not used when they are needed\".<ref>[http://www.nd.edu/~krocinst/ocpapers/op_18_2.pdf Pakistan's Nuclear Weapons Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112015736/http://www.nd.edu/~krocinst/ocpapers/op_18_2.pdf |date=12 November 2008 }}</ref> Many such ambiguous statements from officials of both countries were viewed as warnings of an impending nuclear crisis where the combatants would consider use of their limited nuclear arsenals in \"tactical\" nuclear warfare in the belief that it would not have ended in [[mutual assured destruction]], as could have occurred in a nuclear conflict between the United States and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some experts believe that following nuclear tests in 1998, the Pakistani military was emboldened by its nuclear deterrent to markedly increase coercion against India.<ref>George Perkovich, [http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&id=17967 \"Options Available to the United States to Counter a Nuclear Iran\"], Testimony before the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services]], 1 February 2006.</ref>\n\nThe nature of the India-Pakistan conflict took a more sinister turn when the United States received intelligence that Pakistani nuclear [[warhead]]s were being moved towards the border. Bill Clinton tried to dissuade Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif from nuclear [[brinkmanship]], even threatening Pakistan of dire consequences. According to a [[White House]] official, Sharif seemed to be genuinely surprised by this supposed missile movement and responded that India was probably planning the same. In a May 2000 article, Sanjay Badri-Maharaj claimed that India too had readied at least five nuclear-tipped [[ballistic missile]]s, but could not back up this claim with any official proof.<ref>''India had deployed [[Agni missile system|Agni]] during Kargil'', Article from \"Indian Express\" 19 June 2000</ref>\n\nSensing a deteriorating military scenario, diplomatic isolation, and the risks of a larger conventional and nuclear war, Sharif ordered the Pakistani army to vacate the Kargil heights. He later claimed in his official biography that General Pervez Musharraf had moved nuclear warheads without informing him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/daily/july-2006/6/index16.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223045736/http://www.nation.com.pk/daily/july-2006/6/index16.php|archivedate=23 December 2007|title=Musharraf moved nuclear weapons in Kargil war|work=The Nation|accessdate=27 May 2009}}</ref> Recently however, Pervez Musharraf revealed in his memoirs that Pakistan's nuclear delivery system was not operational during the Kargil war;<ref name=\"Memoirs\" /> something that would have put Pakistan under serious disadvantage if the conflict went nuclear.\n\nThe threat of [[Weapons of mass destruction|WMD]] included [[chemical weapon|chemical]] and even [[biological weapon]]s. Pakistan accused India of using chemical weapons and [[Incendiary device|incendiary weapons]] such as [[napalm]] against the Kashmiri fighters. India, on the other hand, showcased a cache of [[gas mask]]s as proof that Pakistan may have been prepared to use non-conventional weapons.
