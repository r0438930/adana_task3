Curry was critical of \"groupthink\", and was engaging actively with the climate change denial community,{{Failed verification|date=April 2020}} because she believes that some of them brought up valid points, and that lumping the good with the bad could lead to missed opportunities to improve the science. \n\nCurry is critical of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), a United Nations\u2013sponsored body who reports the consensus on climate science. She does not have confidence in their process, and has stated: \"So it's not so much as finding things that were wrong, but rather ignorance that was unrecognized and confidence that was overstated\".<ref name=\"Lemonick\"/>\n\nCurry also asserts that scientists have not adequately dealt with the uncertainty in their calculations. She argues that: \"There's a whole host of unknown unknowns that we don't even know how to quantify but that should be factored into our confidence level\". The IPCC estimates are uncertain by a few percent, and the consensus of climate scientists other than Curry who have discussed the matter is that this is not enough to significantly impact the projections.\n<ref name=\"Lemonick\"/>\n\nCurry retired in 2017 from her tenured position as a professor at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology at age 63, because of what she calls \"the poisonous nature of the scientific discussion around human-caused global warming\". [[Michael E. Mann|Michael Mann]] said climate science would be stronger without her because of her \"confusionism and denialism\". In an interview with [[Environment & Energy Publishing|eenews.net]] at the time of her retirement she argued for more focus on reducing climate change vulnerabilities.<ref name=\"Waldman\">{{Cite web|last=Waldman|first=Scott|date=4 January 2017|title= Judith Curry retires, citing 'craziness' of climate science |url=https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060047798|publisher=Environment & Energy Publishing, LLC |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2014 and February 2019, Curry testified before at least six Republican-led House committees, expressing the idea that the dangers of global warming are overstated and difficult to predict. These testimonies include statements criticizing President Obama's climate plan, the UN climate action plan, and other policy proposals aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In her testimony before the Natural Resources Committee on February 6, 2019, Curry stated that, \"Man-made climate change is not an existential threat in the 21st century....

Though these arguments place her outside the academic consensus, Curry said that her findings were compatible with those presented by the [[International Panel on Climate Change]].

Curry was critical of \"groupthink\", and was engaging actively with the climate change denial community,{{Failed verification|date=April 2020}} because she believes that some of them brought up valid points, and that lumping the good with the bad could lead to missed opportunities to improve the science. \n\nCurry is critical of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), a United Nations\u2013sponsored body who reports the consensus on climate science. She does not have confidence in their process, and has stated: \"So it's not so much as finding things that were wrong, but rather ignorance that was unrecognized and confidence that was overstated\".<ref name=\"Lemonick\"/>\n\nCurry also asserts that scientists have not adequately dealt with the uncertainty in their calculations. She argues that: \"There's a whole host of unknown unknowns that we don't even know how to quantify but that should be factored into our confidence level\". The IPCC estimates are uncertain by a few percent, and the consensus of climate scientists other than Curry who have discussed the matter is that this is not enough to significantly impact the projections.\n<ref name=\"Lemonick\"/>\n\nCurry retired in 2017 from her tenured position as a professor at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology at age 63, because of what she calls \"the poisonous nature of the scientific discussion around human-caused global warming\". [[Michael E. Mann|Michael Mann]] said climate science would be stronger without her because of her \"confusionism and denialism\". In an interview with [[Environment & Energy Publishing|eenews.net]] at the time of her retirement she argued for more focus on reducing climate change vulnerabilities.<ref name=\"Waldman\">{{Cite web|last=Waldman|first=Scott|date=4 January 2017|title= Judith Curry retires, citing 'craziness' of climate science |url=https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060047798|publisher=Environment & Energy Publishing, LLC |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2014 and February 2019, Curry testified before at least six Republican-led House committees, expressing the idea that the dangers of global warming are overstated and difficult to predict. These testimonies include statements criticizing President Obama's climate plan, the UN climate action plan, and other policy proposals aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In her testimony before the Natural Resources Committee on February 6, 2019, Curry stated that, \"Man-made climate change is not an existential threat in the 21st century....

Though these arguments place her outside the academic consensus, Curry said that her findings were compatible with those presented by the [[International Panel on Climate Change]]. An [[Associated Press]] article suggested that Curry's arguments could dampen moves by cities and municipalities to start lawsuits against oil-and-gas companies seeking recompense for anticipated future damage due to sea level rise.<ref name=sealevel>{{cite web |last1=Richardson |first1=Valerie |title=Judith Curry sea-level study disputes climate-disaster predictions |url=https://apnews.com/8ea04da69167f2e69d7821c752a9b7e2 |website=AP NEWS |accessdate=23 January 2020 |date=27 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nSome political figures have used Curry's statements and writings in their arguments.
