After the first flowering, it divides to form a much-branched crown with tufts of leaves at the tips of the branches. Each branch may fork after producing a flowering stem. The pale to dark grey bark is corky, persistent and fissured, and feels spongy to the touch.<ref name=\"PCN\"/><ref name=\"STP\"/><ref name=\"FNZ\"/><ref name=\"SAL\"/>\n\nThe long narrow leaves are sword-shaped, erect, dark to light green, {{convert|40|to|100|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|to|7|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=2}} wide at the base, with numerous parallel veins.<ref name=\"PCN\"/><ref name=\"FNZ\"/> The leaves grow in crowded clusters at the ends of the branches, and may droop slightly at the tips and bend down from the bases when old. They are thick and have an indistinct [[Leaf|midrib]]. The fine nerves are more or less equal and parallel. The upper and lower leaf surfaces are similar.<ref name=\"SAL\"/>\n\nIn spring and early summer, sweetly perfumed flowers are produced in large, dense [[panicle]]s (flower spikes) {{convert|60|to|100|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, bearing well-spaced to somewhat crowded, almost [[sessility (botany)|sessile]] to sessile flowers and axes. The flowers are crowded along the ultimate branches of the panicles. The [[bract]]s which protect the developing flowers often have a distinct pink tinge before the flowers open. In south [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] and [[North Otago]] the bracts are green.<ref name=\"PCN\"/><ref name=\"FNZ\"/><ref name=\"S76\"/>\n\nThe individual flowers are {{convert|5|to|6|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} in diameter, the [[tepal]]s are free almost to the base, and reflexed.

Each inflorescence bears 5,000 to 10,000 sweetly perfumed flowers and may produce up to 40,000 seeds.]]\n\nNew Zealand's native ''Cordyline'' species are relics of an influx of tropical plants that arrived from the north 15 million years ago in the warm [[Miocene]] era.<ref name=\"S41\"/> Because it has evolved in response to the local climate, geology and other factors, ''C.&nbsp;australis'' varies in appearance from place to place. This variation can alter the overall appearance of the tree, canopy shape and branch size, the relative shape and size of the leaves, and their colour and stiffness. There may also be invisible adaptations for resistance to disease or insect attack.<ref name=\"S68\"/> Some of these regional provenances are different enough to have been named by North Island M\u0101ori: T\u012bt\u012b in the north, t\u012b manu in the central uplands, tarariki in the east and wharanui in the west.<ref name=\"S71\"/>\nIn [[Northland Region|Northland]], ''C.&nbsp;australis'' shows a great deal of genetic diversity\u2014suggesting it is where old genetic lines have endured.<ref name=\"S58\"/> Some trees in the far north have floppy, narrow leaves, which botanist Philip Simpson attributes to hybridisation with ''[[Cordyline pumilio|C.&nbsp;pumilio]]'', the dwarf cabbage tree.<ref name=\"S69\"/> In eastern Northland, ''C.&nbsp;australis'' generally has narrow, straight dark green leaves, but some trees have much broader leaves than normal and may have hybridised with the Three Kings cabbage tree, ''C.&nbsp;obtecta'', which grows at [[North Cape, New Zealand|North Cape]] and on nearby islands. These ''obtecta''-like characteristics appear in populations of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' along parts of the eastern coastline from the [[Karikari Peninsula]] to the [[Coromandel Peninsula]]. In western Northland and [[Auckland Region|Auckland]], a form often called t\u012bt\u012b grows. When young, t\u012bt\u012b are generally very spindly, and are common in young [[Agathis australis|kauri]] forests.<ref name=\"S70-71\"/> When growing in the open, t\u012bt\u012b can become massive trees with numerous, long thin branches and relatively short, broad leaves.<ref name=\"S70\"/>\n\nIn the central Volcanic Plateau, cabbage trees are tall, with stout, relatively unbranched stems and large stiff straight leaves. Fine specimens are found along the upper [[Whanganui River]]. On old trees, the leaves tend to be relatively broad. The leaves radiate strongly, suggesting that t\u012b manu is adapted to the cold winters of the upland central plateau. It may have originated in the open country created by [[lava]], [[volcanic ash]], and [[pumice]]. Trees of the t\u012b manu type are also found in northern [[Taranaki]], the [[King Country]] and the [[Bay of Plenty]] lowlands.<ref name=\"S70-71\"/>\n\nTarariki are found in the east of the North Island from [[East Cape]] to the [[Wairarapa]]. M\u0101ori valued the narrow spiky leaves as a source of particularly tough, durable fibre. Tarariki's strong leaf fibres may be an adaptation to the region's hot, dry summers. In parts of the Wairarapa, the trees are particularly spiky, with stiff leaves and partially rolled leaf-blades. The trees near East Cape, by contrast, have leaves that hang laxly on the tree. In [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]], some trees have greener, broader leaves, and this may be because of wharanui characteristics brought in across the main divide through the [[Manawatu Gorge]].<ref name=\"S69, 71\"/>\n\nWharanui grow to the west of the North Island's main divide. They have long, broad flaccid leaves, which may be an adaptation to persistent westerly winds. The wharanui type occurs in [[Wellington]], [[Horowhenua]] and [[Whanganui]], and extends with some modifications to the southern [[Taranaki]] coast.<ref name=\"S69, 71\"/> In Taranaki, cabbage trees generally have a compact canopy with broad straight leaves.<ref name=\"S72\"/> In the South Island, wharanui is the most common form, but it is variable. The typical form grows, with little variation, from [[Cape Campbell]] to the northern [[Catlins]], and from the eastern coast to the foothills of the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]]. In [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]]'s [[Wairau Valley]], cabbage trees tend to retain their old, dead leaves, lending them an untidy appearance. The climate there is an extreme one, with hot, dry summers and cold winters.<ref name=\"S70\"/>\n\nIn north-west [[Tasman Region|Nelson]], there are three [[ecotype]]s defined by soil and exposure. Trees growing on limestone bluffs have stiff, blue-green leaves. On the river flats, the trees are tall with narrow, lax, dark green leaves, and an uneven canopy. They resemble the cabbage trees of the North Island's East Cape. Along the coast to the far west, the trees are robust with broad, bluish leaves. The latter two forms extend down the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]], with the lax-leaved forms growing in moist, fertile, sheltered river valleys while the bluish-leaved forms prefer rocky slopes exposed to the full force of the salt-laden coastal winds.<ref name=\"S70-71\"/>\n\n[[File:Futuro house Warrington.JPG|thumb|right|Cabbage trees surround a [[Futuro]] house in [[Warrington, New Zealand|Warrington]], Otago]] In [[Otago]], cabbage trees gradually become less common towards the south until they come to an end in the northern Catlins.<ref name=\"S66\"/> They reappear on the south coast at [[Waikawa, Southland]], but they are not the wharanui type. Rather they are vigorous trees with broad, green leaves and broad canopies. They extend along the coast towards [[Fiordland]], and inland to the margins of some of the [[glacier]]-fed lakes. Very vigorous when they are young, these trees seem well adapted to the very cold winters of the south.<ref name=\"S71\"/>\n\nA study of seedlings grown from seed collected in 28 areas showed a north-south change in leaf shape and dimensions. Seedling leaves get longer and narrower southwards. Seedlings often have leaves with red-brown pigmentation which disappears in older plants, and this coloration becomes increasingly common towards the south. The changes in shape\u2014leaves getting narrower and more robust from north to south and from lowland to [[montane]]\u2014suggest adaptations to colder weather.<ref name=\"S73\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy and names==\n[[Image:Cabbage-tree-inflorescence-branching-order.png|thumb|alt=Diagram showing a large branch, numbered 1, with a secondary branch numbered 2, which in turn produces tertiary branches numbered 3 smaller sub-branches numbered 4, one of which in turn produces a side branch numbered 5.

The common name ''cabbage tree'' is attributed by some sources to early settlers having used the young leaves as a substitute for cabbage.<ref name=\"P\"/> However the name probably predates the settlement of New Zealand \u2014 Georg Forster, writing in his ''Voyage round the World'' of 1777 about the events of Friday, April 23, 1773, refers on page 114 to the discovery of a related species in [[Fiordland]] as \"not the true cabbage palm\" and says \"the central shoot, when quite tender, tastes something like an almond's kernel, with a little of the flavour of cabbage.\"<ref name=\"F\"/> Forster may have been referring to the [[cabbage palmetto]] (''Sabal palmetto'') of Florida, which resembles the Cordyline somewhat, and was named for the cabbage-like appearance of its terminal bud.\n\n''Cordyline australis'' is the tallest of New Zealand's five native ''Cordyline'' species. Of these, the commonest are ''[[Cordyline banksii|C.&nbsp;banksii]]'', which has a slender, sweeping trunk, and ''[[Cordyline indivisa|C.&nbsp;indivisa]]'', a handsome plant with a trunk up to {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=off}} tall bearing a massive head of broad leaves up to {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long.<ref name=\"P\"/> In the far north of New Zealand, ''C.&nbsp;australis'' can be distinguished by its larger heavily branched tree form, narrower leaves and smaller seeds from ''[[Cordyline obtecta|C.&nbsp;obtecta]]'', the Three Kings cabbage tree,<ref name=\"S77\"/> its closest relative.<ref name=\"S95\"/> ''C.&nbsp;australis'' is rather variable, and forms from the northern offshore islands may be hybrids with ''C.&nbsp;obtecta''.<ref name=\"PCN\"/> Hybrids with ''[[Cordyline pumilio|C.&nbsp;pumilio]]'' and ''C.&nbsp;banksii'' also occur often where the plants are in close vicinity, because they flower at about the same time and share the [[chromosome number]] 2n=38, with ''C.&nbsp;australis''.<ref name=\"S77\"/>\n\nThe tree was well known to [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] before its scientific discovery. The generic [[M\u0101ori language]] term for plants in the genus ''Cordyline'' is ''t\u012b'', and names recorded as specific to ''C.&nbsp;australis'' include ''t\u012b k\u014duka'', ''t\u012b k\u0101uka'', ''t\u012b r\u0101kau'', ''t\u012b awe'', ''t\u012b pua'', and ''t\u012b whanake''.<ref name=\"FNZ\"/><ref name=\"WIL\"/><ref name=\"B\"/> Each tribe had names for the tree depending on its local uses and characteristics. Simpson reports that the names highlight the characteristics of the tree that were important to M\u0101ori.<ref name=\"S143\"/> These include what the plant looked like\u2014whether it was a large tree (''t\u012b r\u0101kau'', ''t\u012b pua''), the whiteness of its flowers (''t\u012b puatea''), whether its leaves were broad (''t\u012b wharanui''), twisted along the edges (''t\u012b tahanui''), or spiky (''t\u012b tarariki''). Other names refer to its uses\u2014whether its fruit attracted birds (''t\u012b manu''), or the leaves were particularly suitable for making ropes (''t\u012b whanake'') and nets (''t\u012b kupenga''). The most widely used name, ''t\u012b k\u014duka'', refers to the use of the leaf hearts as food.<ref name=\"S143-145\"/>\n\n==Ecology==\n[[Image:Redcrown in Cabbage Tree.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A parakeet eating small white flowers|A k\u0101k\u0101riki|A k\u0101k\u0101riki|A [[k\u0101k\u0101riki]] feeding on flowers of ''Cordyline australis'' on [[Tiritiri Matangi Island]]. The parakeets are often seen foraging in cabbage trees on the island]]\n\n===Habitat===\nA quote from Philip Simpson sums up the wide range of habitats the cabbage tree occupied in early New Zealand, and how much its abundance and distinctive form shaped the impression travellers received of the country:\n<blockquote>\"In primeval New Zealand cabbage trees occupied a range of habitats, anywhere open, moist, fertile and warm enough for them to establish and mature: with forest; around the rocky coast; in lowland swamps, around the lakes and along the lower rivers; and perched on isolated rocks. Approaching the land from the sea would have reminded a Polynesian traveller of home, and for a European traveller, conjured up images of the tropical Pacific\".<ref name=\"S57\"/></blockquote>\n\n''Cordyline australis'' occurs from North Cape to the very south of the South Island, where it becomes less and less common,<ref name=\"S67\"/> until it reaches its southernmost natural limits at Sandy Point (46\u00b0 30' S), west of [[Invercargill]] near [[Oreti Beach]]. It is absent from much of Fiordland, probably because there is no suitable habitat, and is unknown on the subantarctic islands to the south of New Zealand, probably because it is too cold. It occurs on some offshore islands\u2014[[Poor Knights Islands|Poor Knights]], Stewart and the Chathams\u2014but was probably introduced by M\u0101ori. In the Stewart Island region, it is rare,<ref name=\"DCF\"/> growing only on certain islands, headlands and former settlement sites where it may have been introduced by [[Sooty shearwater|muttonbird]] collectors,<ref name=\"S67, 142\"/> while on the Chatham Islands it is also largely \"a notable absentee\".<ref name=\"DAW\"/>\n\nGenerally a lowland species, it grows from sea level to about {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=off}}, reaching its upper limits on the volcanoes of the central North Island, where eruptions have created open spaces for it to exploit, and in the foothills of the Southern Alps in the South Island, where deforestation may have played a part in giving it room to grow. In the central North Island, it has evolved a much sturdier form (with the [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] name ''t\u012b manu'', meaning \"with branches bearing broad, straight upright leaves\").<ref name=\"S52-53\"/> This form resembles that found in the far south of the South Island, suggesting that they are both adapted to cold conditions.<ref name=\"S67\"/>\n\n''Cordyline australis'' is a light-demanding pioneer species, and seedlings die when overtopped by other trees. To grow well, young plants require open space so they are not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides unless there is a seepage area. The fertility of the soil is another factor\u2014settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why ''C.&nbsp;australis'' is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.<ref name=\"S53-54\"/>\n\nEarly European explorers of New Zealand described \"jungles of cabbage trees\" along the banks of streams and rivers, in huge swamps and lowland valleys. Few examples of this former abundance survive today\u2014such areas were the first to be cleared by farmers looking for flat land and fertile soil.<ref name=\"S54-55\"/> In modern New Zealand, cabbage trees usually grow as isolated individuals rather than as parts of a healthy ecosystem.<ref name=\"S68\"/>\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Kereru (New Zealand Wood Pigeon).jpg|thumb|alt=A New Zealand pigeon stands on the fruiting spike of a cabbage tree|A [[New Zealand pigeon]] feeds on the small white fruit of a cabbage tree, [[Dunedin]], August 2009. Native pigeons were once the major dispersers of the tree's seeds, which they eat in autumn and winter. Note also the notches cut out of the leaves by larvae of ''[[Epiphryne verriculata]]'', the cabbage tree moth]]\nThe cabbage tree's year begins in autumn among the tight spike of unopened leaves projecting from the centre of each tuft of leaves. Some of the growing tips have changed from making leaves to producing [[inflorescence]]s for the coming spring, and around these, two or three buds begin to produce leaves. The inflorescence and the leaf buds pass the winter protected by the enveloping spike of unopened leaves.<ref name=\"S89\"/> Months later in spring or early summer, it bears its flowers on the outside of the tree, exposed to insects and birds.<ref name=\"S108\"/> \n\nFlowering takes place over a period of four to six weeks, giving maximum exposure to pollinating insects.<ref name=\"S109\"/> The flowers produce a sweet perfume which attracts large numbers of insects. The nectar produced by the flowers contains aromatic compounds, mainly [[ester]]s and [[terpene]]s, which are particularly attractive to moths. Bees use the nectar to produce a light honey to feed their young and increase the size of the hive in the early summer.<ref name=\"S110\"/> It takes about two months for the fruit to ripen, and by the end of summer a cabbage tree can have thousands of small fruits available for birds to eat and disperse. The strong framework of the inflorescence can easily bear the weight of heavy birds like the New Zealand pigeon, which was formerly the major disperser of the seeds. \n\nEach fruit contains three to six shiny, black seeds which are coated in a charcoal-like substance called [[phytomelan]]. The latter may serve to protect the seeds from the digestive process in the gut of a bird. The seeds are also rich in [[linoleic acid]] as a food source for the developing embryo plant, a compound which is also important in the egg-laying cycle of birds.<ref name=\"S112\"/> Because it takes about two years for a particular stem to produce an inflorescence, cabbage trees tend to flower heavily in alternative years, with a bumper flowering every three to five years.<ref name=\"S111\"/> Each inflorescence bears 5,000 to 10,000 flowers, so a large inflorescence may carry about 40,000 seeds, or one million seeds for the whole tree in a good flowering year\u2014hundreds of millions for a healthy grove of trees.<ref name=\"S108, 112\"/>\n\n===Response to fire===\n''Cordyline australis'' is one of the few New Zealand forest trees that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the protected rhizomes under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a fertile soil around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers to make the most of the light and space opened up by the flames.<ref name=\"S67\"/>\n\nOlder trees sometimes grow [[epicormic shoot]]s directly from their trunks after storm or fire damage. Aerial rhizomes can also be produced from the trunk if it sustains damage or has become hollow, and grow down into the soil to regenerate the plant. Such regeneration can lead to trees of great age with multiple trunks.<ref name=\"S98-100\"/>\n\n===Biodiversity===\n[[Image:Cabbagetreebark2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Close-up of a tree trunk covered with rough bark |The corky, fissured bark of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' feels spongy to the touch]]\nMany plants and animals are associated with ''C.&nbsp;australis'' in healthy ecosystems. The most common [[epiphyte]]s are ferns, astelias and orchids. Old trees often carry large clumps of the climbing fern ''[[Asplenium]]'', and in moist places, filmy ferns and kidney ferns cling to the branches. ''[[Astelia]]'' species and ''[[Collospermum hastatum|Collospermum]]'' often establish in the main fork of the tree, and one tree can host several species of native orchid. Other common epiphytes include ''[[Griselinia lucida]]'', as well as a range of mosses, liverworts, lichens and fungi. Two fungus species which infect living tissue\u2014''[[Phanaerochaeta cordylines]]'' and ''[[Sphaeropsis cordylines]]''\u2014occur almost exclusively on ''C.&nbsp;australis''.<ref name=\"S80-82\"/>\n\nAnimals and birds associated with ''C.&nbsp;australis'' include lizards which forage among the flowers, including the [[gold-striped gecko]] which is well camouflaged for life among the leaves of the tree.<ref name=\"S82-83\"/> [[New Zealand bellbird]]s like to nest under the dead leaves or among the flower stalks, and [[paradise shelduck]]s commonly build their nests in the base of an old cabbage tree standing in the middle of a field. [[Red-crowned parakeet]]s are often seen foraging in cabbage trees.<ref name=\"CAT\"/> In South Canterbury, [[New Zealand long-tailed bat|long-tailed bat]]s shelter during the day in the hollow branches, which would once have provided nesting holes for many birds.<ref name=\"S82-83\"/>\n\nThe berries of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' are enjoyed by bellbirds, [[Tui (bird)|tui]] and [[New Zealand pigeon|pigeon]]s.<ref name=\"M\"/> M\u0101ori sometimes planted groves of cabbage trees ({{lang|mi|p\u0101 t\u012b}}) to attract pigeons which could be snared when they came to eat the berries.<ref name=\"S150\"/> Reminiscing in 1903 about life in New Zealand sixty or more years earlier, George Clarke describes how such a [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] grove of cabbage trees would attract huge numbers of pigeons: \"About four miles from our house, there was a great preserve of wood pigeons, that was made as tapu as the native chiefs could devise. At a certain season, the pigeons came in vast flocks to feed on the white berries of the Ti tree (brac\u0153na) [sic] and got so heavy with fat that they could hardly fly from one tree to another. No gun was allowed in the place. The Maoris, with a long slender rod and a slip noose at the end, squatted under the leaves and noiselessly slipped the noose over the necks of the stupid pigeons as they were feeding.\"<ref name=\"CLK\"/> As the native birds have vanished from much of New Zealand with the clearing of forests, it is now flocks of [[European starling|starling]]s which descend upon the fruit.<ref name=\"S82-83\"/>\n\nThe nectar of the flowers is sought after by insects, bellbirds, tui, and [[stitchbird]]s. The leaves and the rough bark provide excellent homes for insects such as caterpillars and moths, small beetles, fly larvae, [[weta]], snails and slugs. Many of these are then eaten by birds such as [[saddleback (bird)|saddleback]]s and [[North Island robin|robin]]s. The rough bark also provides opportunities for epiphytes to cling and grow, and lizards hide amongst the dead leaves, coming out to drink the nectar and to eat the insects.<ref name=\"STP\"/><ref name=\"SAL\"/> Good flowering seasons occur every few years only. While it is said that they foretell dry summers, it has been observed that they tend to follow dry seasons.<ref name=\"P\"/>\n\nInsects, including beetles, moths, wasps and flies, use the bark, leaves and flowers of the tree in various ways. Some feed or hide camouflaged in the skirt of dead leaves, a favourite dry place for weta to hide in winter. Many of the insect companions of the tree have followed it into the domesticated surroundings of parks and home gardens.<ref name=\"S83-84\"/> If the leaves are left to decay, the soil underneath cabbage trees becomes a black humus that supports a rich array of amphipods, earthworms and millipedes.<ref name=\"S86\"/>\n\nThere are nine species of insect only found on ''C.&nbsp;australis'', of which the best known is ''[[Epiphryne verriculata]]'', the cabbage tree moth, which is perfectly adapted to hide on a dead leaf. Its caterpillars eat large holes and wedges in the leaves. The moth lays its eggs at the base of the central spike of unopened leaves. The caterpillars eat holes in the surface of the leaves and leave characteristic notches in the leaf margins. They can infest young trees but seldom damage older trees, which lack the skirt of dead leaves where the parent moths like to hide.<ref name=\"S84\"/>\n\n==Threats, pests and diseases==\n\n===Sudden decline===\n[[File:Sudden Decline.jpg|thumb|alt=Dead tree standing in a rural field|Sudden Decline has decimated populations of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' in some parts of New Zealand]]\nCases of sick and dying trees of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' were first reported in the northern part of the North Island in 1987. The syndrome, eventually called Sudden Decline, soon reached epidemic proportions in Northland and Auckland. Affected trees usually suffer total defoliation within 2 to 12 months. The foliage turns yellow, and the oldest leaves wither and fall off. Growth of leaves ceases, and eventually all the leaves fall, leaving dead branches, often with the dried-out flowering panicles still attached. At the same time, the bark on the trunk becomes loose and detaches easily. The greatest number of dead trees (18 to 26 percent) was recorded around Auckland.<ref name=\"RG\"/>\n\nFor some years, the cause of the disease was unknown, and hypotheses included tree ageing, fungi, viruses, and environmental factors such as an increase in ultra-violet light.<ref name=\"DCF\"/> Another hypothesis was that a genetic problem may have been induced in Northland and Auckland by the thousands of cabbage trees brought into the area from elsewhere and planted in gardens and parks.<ref name=\"S68\"/> The [[Department of Survey and Land Information|Lands and Survey Department]] had a native plant nursery at [[Taupo]] in the central North Island, which was used to grow plants for use in parks, reserves and carparks. In many Northland parks, cabbage trees from the central North Island were growing and flowering within metres of natural forms. Any offspring produced might have been poorly adapted to local conditions.<ref name=\"S69\"/> After nearly five years of work, scientists found the cause was a bacterium ''[[Phytoplasma|Phytoplasma australiense]]'', which may be spread from tree to tree by a tiny sap-sucking insect, the introduced [[Scolypopa australis|passion vine hopper]].\n\nPopulations of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' were decimated in some parts of New Zealand because of Sudden Decline. In some areas, particularly in the north, no big trees are left. Although Sudden Decline often affects cabbage trees in farmland and open areas, trees in natural forest patches continue to do well. Trees in the southern North Island and northern South Island are generally unaffected with few dead branches and no symptoms of Sudden Decline. By 2010, there was evidence to suggest the severity of the disease was lessening.<ref name=\"PCN\"/><ref name=\"DCF\"/><ref name=\"RG\"/>\n\n===Rural decline===\nThe plight of ''Cordyline australis'' in the Sudden Decline epidemic drew attention to another widespread threat to the tree in rural areas throughout New Zealand.<ref name=\"S10\"/> Rural Decline was the name proposed by botanists to refer to a decline in health of older trees in pasture and grazed shrubland, leading over many years to the loss of upper branches and eventual death.\n\nOften farmers would leave a solitary cabbage tree\u2014or even groves of trees\u2014standing after the swamps were drained. Most of these trees will slowly die out because livestock eat the seedlings and damage the trunks and roots of adult trees.<ref name=\"PCN\"/><ref name=\"S80-86\"/> When a cabbage tree is the only shade in a field, stock will shelter underneath it, damaging the bark by rubbing against it, and compacting the soil around the tree. Cows, sheep, goats, and deer eat the nutritious tissue under the bark of cabbage trees.<ref name=\"S87, 267\"/> Once the trunk has been damaged by animals, it seldom heals and the wounds get bigger over time. Eventually the tissue in the centre of the stem rots away and a cavity forms along its entire length. The trunk becomes misshapen or completely ring-barked for a metre above the ground. Often the growth layer dies and the injuries may lead to bacterial or fungal infections that spread into the branches until the canopy too begins to die.<ref name=\"S267\"/> Other factors thought to contribute to Rural Decline include wood-rotting fungi like ''Phanerochaete cordylines'', micro-organisms which cause [[Detritivore|saprobic decay]] and leaf-feeding caterpillars.<ref name=\"BEE65\"/>\n\nOther mammals can be destructive. [[Common brushtail possum (New Zealand)|Possums]] tend not to eat the leaves of the tree, but are very fond of eating the sugar-rich flowering stalks as they emerge. They also like using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more destructive, especially during periods of drought, when they have been seen to eat through the base until a tree falls, and then eating the fallen tree completely. Horses can also fell a tree by eating through the trunk.<ref name=\"S87, 267\"/>\n\n==M\u0101ori cultural uses==\n[[Image:SwingAngas1847.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Early 19th century coloured drawing showing Maori children swinging from long ropes coming from the top of a high pole while a group of adults watches them|Morere swings provided a source of amusement for M\u0101ori children. The ropes had to be strong, so they were often made from leaves or fibre of ''C.&nbsp;australis'', which were much tougher than the fibres of New Zealand flax]]\nIn traditional times, M\u0101ori had a rich knowledge of the cabbage tree, including spiritual, ecological and many practical aspects of its use. While much of that specialised knowledge was lost after the European settlement of New Zealand, the use of the tree as food and medicine has persisted, and the use of its fibres for weaving is becoming more common.<ref name=\"S143\"/>\n\n===Food===\nThe stems and fleshy rhizomes of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' are high in natural sugars and were steam-cooked in [[earth oven]]s (''umu t\u012b'', a large type of ''[[h\u0101ngi]]'') to produce ''k\u0101uru'', a carbohydrate-rich food used to sweeten other foods. The growing tips or leaf hearts were stripped of leaves and eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable, when they were called ''k\u014duka''\u2014the origin of the M\u0101ori name of the tree.<ref name=\"STP\"/><ref name=\"O\"/> The southern limit of [[Sweet potato|kumara]] (sweet potato) cultivation was at [[Banks Peninsula]] at 43\u00b0S, and south of there a culture developed around ''C.&nbsp;australis''. Natural and planted groves of the cabbage tree were harvested.<ref name=\"S66\"/>\n\nLarge parties trimmed the cut stems, and left them to dry for days or weeks.<ref name=\"O\"/><ref name=\"H\"/> As well as stems, the rhizomes\u2014extensions of the trunk below the surface of the ground shaped like enormous carrots\u2014were also dug up to be cooked. In the early 1840s, Edward Shortland said M\u0101ori preferred rhizomes from trees growing in deep rich soil. They dug them in spring or early summer just before the flowering of the plant, when they were at their sweetest.<ref name=\"P\"/> November was the favourite month for preparing k\u0101uru in the South Island.<ref name=\"C174-175\"/>\n\nAfter drying, the harvested stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 hours or more in the umu t\u012b pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate [[fructan]] in the stems to very sweet [[fructose]]. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then flattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. K\u0101uru could be stored dry until the time came to add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. K\u0101uru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to smell and taste like [[molasses]].<ref name=\"P\"/><ref name=\"O\"/><ref name=\"H\"/><ref name=\"SCH12\"/>\n\nEvidence of large cooking pits (umu t\u012b) can still be found in the hills of [[Canterbury, New Zealand|South Canterbury]] and [[North Otago]], where large groves of cabbage trees still stand.<ref name=\"S66\"/> Europeans used the plant to make alcohol, and the often fearsome brews were relished by whalers and sealers.<ref name=\"SCH12\"/>\n\nThe k\u014data, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as medicine. When cooked, it was called the k\u014duka.<ref name=\"S146, 150\"/> If the spike of unopened leaves and a few outer leaves is gripped firmly at the base and bent, it will snap off. The leaves can be removed, and what remains is like a small artichoke heart that can be steamed, roasted or boiled to make k\u014duka, a bitter vegetable available at any time of the year. K\u014duka is delicious as a relish with fatty foods like eel, [[Sooty shearwater|muttonbirds]], or pigeons, or in modern times, pork, mutton and beef. Different trees were selected for their degree of bitterness, which should be strong for medicinal use, but less so when used as a vegetable.<ref name=\"S150\"/>\n\n===Fibre===\nA tough fibre was extracted from the leaves of ''C.&nbsp;australis'', and was valued for its strength and durability especially in seawater. The leaves were\nused for making anchor ropes and fishing lines, cooking mats, baskets, sandals and leggings for protection when travelling in the South Island high country, home of the prickly speargrasses (''[[Aciphylla]]'') and t\u016bmatakuru or matagouri (''[[Discaria toumatou]]'').<ref name=\"SCH11\"/> Morere swings provided a source of amusement for M\u0101ori children. The ropes had to be strong, so they were often made from the leaves or fibre of ''C.&nbsp;australis'', which were much tougher than the fibres of [[Phormium tenax|New Zealand flax]].<ref name=\"S160\"/> The leaves were also used for rain capes, although the mountain cabbage tree ''C.&nbsp;indivisa'', was preferred.<ref name=\"SCH11\"/> The fibre made from cabbage tree leaves is stronger than that made from [[Phormium tenax|New Zealand flax]].<ref name=\"STP\"/><ref name=\"O\"/>\n\n===Medicine===\nThe M\u0101ori used various parts of ''Cordyline australis'' to treat injuries and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste.<ref name=\"STP\"/> The k\u014data, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser.<ref name=\"S150\"/> Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion of the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains.<ref name=\"MUP\"/> The seeds of ''Cordyline australis'' are high in [[linoleic acid]], one of the essential fatty acids.<ref name=\"MUP\"/>\n\n==Cultivation today==\n[[Image:Palms in Alderney.JPG|thumb|alt=A grove of trees with lots of long strap-like leaves, through which the sea and a boat can be seen|''C.&nbsp;australis'' is widely cultivated outside New Zealand. Here it grows on [[Alderney]], one of the [[Channel Islands]]]]\n''Cordyline australis'' is one of the most widely cultivated New Zealand native trees. In Northwest Europe and other cool [[Oceanic climate|oceanic climates]], it is very popular as an ornamental tree because it looks like a palm tree.<ref name=\"S70-74\"/> Hardy forms from the coldest areas of the southern or inland South Island tolerate Northern Hemisphere conditions best, while North Island forms are much more tender.<ref name=\"HBS\"/> It is easily grown from fresh seed \u2014 seedlings often spontaneously appear in gardens from bird-dispersed seed \u2014 and can be grown very easily from shoot, stem and even trunk cuttings. It does well in pots and tubs.<ref name=\"PCN\"/><ref name=\"P\"/>\n\nIt grows well as far north as the western coast of Scotland, including the village of [[Plockton]].<ref name=\"G\"/> It is more common in Southern England and in Ireland where it is grown all over the island. Although not a palm, it is locally named Cornish palm, Manx palm or Torbay palm. The last name is due to its extensive use in Torbay, it being the official symbol of that area, used in tourist posters promoting South Devon as the English Riviera. It also grows in Spain, Italy and Japan.<ref name=\"G\"/> Even though its natural distribution ranges from 34\u00b0 S to 46\u00b0S, and despite its ultimately tropical origins, it also grows at about five degrees from the Arctic Circle in Masfjorden, Norway, latitude 61\u00baN, in a microclimate protected from arctic winds and moderated by the Gulf Stream.<ref name=\"GFC\"/>\n\n===Cultivars===\n[[Image:Cordyline australis 'Red Star' 01.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A potted plant with lots of red strap-like leaves growing in a pebble-covered garden bed|The cultivar ''Cordyline'' 'Red Star' has dark reddish bronze leaves]]\nIn the North Island,<ref name=\"W\"/> M\u0101ori cultivated selected forms of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' for food.<ref name=\"S145\"/> One of these, called t\u012b para or t\u012b t\u0101whiti, was grown because it suckers readily and forms multiple fleshy rhizomes. A dwarf non-flowering selection of ''C.&nbsp;australis'', it has a rubbery, pulpy stem, and thick green leaves. Although it was recorded by the early naturalists, botanists only rediscovered it in the 1990s, being grown by gardeners as the cultivar ''Cordyline'' 'Thomas Kirk'.<ref name=\"S145\"/> Recent and unpublished DNA work suggests it derives from ''C.&nbsp;australis'' of the central North Island.<ref name=\"SCH12-13\"/>\n\n''Cordyline'' 'Ti Tawhiti' was \"the subject of an intense discussion amongst the leading botanists of New Zealand at a meeting of the Royal Society ... in Wellington 100 years ago. It was saved from extinction because its dwarf form found favour with gardeners and it came to be known as Cordyline 'Kirkii' recording the interest Thomas Kirk had in the plant. Its origin as a Maori selection was forgotten until rediscovered in 1991. The name 'Tawhiti' is equivalent to 'Hawaiki' and indicates the traditional belief that the plant was introduced to [[Aotearoa]] by the ancestral canoes of Maori. However, it is more probable that the name arose from it being moved around its native land as a domesticated plant.\"<ref name=\"H\"/>\n\nNumerous [[cultivars]] of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' are sold within New Zealand and around the world.<ref name=\"PCN\"/><ref name=\"P\"/> Like other ''Cordyline'' species, ''C.&nbsp;australis'' can produce [[mutation|sports]] which have very attractive colouration, including pink stripes and leaves in various shades of green, yellow or red. An early cultivar was published in France and England in 1870: ''Cordyline australis'' 'Lentiginosa' was described as having tinted leaves with brownish red spots. Other early cultivars included 'Veitchii' (1871) with crimson midribs, 'Atrosanguinea' (1882) with bronze leaves infused with red, 'Atropurpurea' (1886) and 'Purpurea' (1890) with purple leaves, and a range of variegated forms: 'Doucetiana' (1878), 'Argento-striata' (1888) and 'Dalleriana' (1890). In New Zealand and overseas, hybrids with other ''Cordyline'' species feature prominently in the range of cultivars available. [[New Plymouth]] plant breeders Duncan and Davies included hybrids of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' and ''C.&nbsp;banksii'' in their 1925 catalogue, and have produced many new cultivars since. In New Zealand, some of the coloured forms and hybrids seem to be more susceptible to attacks from the cabbage tree moth.<ref name=\"G\"/><ref name=\"S250-251\"/>\n\nImmature forms have become a popular annual house or ornamental plant under the name 'Spikes', or ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'' 'Spikes'. \n<ref name=fg>[http://www.finegardening.com/plantguide/cordyline-australis-purple-tower-giant-dracaena.aspx Fine Gardening: Cordyline australis 'Purple Tower' (Giant dracaena, New Zealand cabbage palm)]</ref> To add to the confusion, these may be misidentified as ''[[Cordyline indivisa]]'' ([[Synonym (taxonomy)|syn.]] ''Dracaena indivisa'').<ref>[http://www.denverplants.com/annual/html/drace_ind.htm Denver Plants: Dracaena indivisa]</ref>\n\n''C. australis'' is hardy to [[Hardiness zone|USDA zones]] 8\u201311.<ref>Dave's Garden - Cabbage Palm, Cabbage Tree, Ti Kouka, Torbay Palm, Dracaena Spike Cordyline australis, http://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/2237/</ref>\n\nIn cultivation in the United Kingdom, ''C. australis''<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Cordyline australis''url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=527}}</ref> and its cultivars 'Sundance',<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Cordyline australis'' 'Sundance'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=2517|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref> 'Torbay Dazzler',<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Cordyline australis'' 'Torbay Dazzler'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=2518|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref> and 'Torbay Red'<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Cordyline australis'' ''|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=4558|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref> have all gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]] (confirmed 2017).<ref>{{cite web  | url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/pdfs/agm-lists/agm-ornamentals.pdf | title = AGM Plants - Ornamental | date = July 2017 | page = 22 | publisher = Royal Horticultural Society | accessdate = 24 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Barry L.

Its fruit is a favourite food source for the [[New Zealand pigeon]] and other native birds. It is common over a wide latitudinal range from the far north of the [[North Island]] at 34\u00b0 25\u2032S to the south of the [[South Island]] at 46\u00b0 30\u2032S.

After the first flowering, it divides to form a much-branched crown with tufts of leaves at the tips of the branches. Each branch may fork after producing a flowering stem. The pale to dark grey bark is corky, persistent and fissured, and feels spongy to the touch.<ref name=\"PCN\"/><ref name=\"STP\"/><ref name=\"FNZ\"/><ref name=\"SAL\"/>\n\nThe long narrow leaves are sword-shaped, erect, dark to light green, {{convert|40|to|100|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|to|7|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=2}} wide at the base, with numerous parallel veins.<ref name=\"PCN\"/><ref name=\"FNZ\"/> The leaves grow in crowded clusters at the ends of the branches, and may droop slightly at the tips and bend down from the bases when old. They are thick and have an indistinct [[Leaf|midrib]]. The fine nerves are more or less equal and parallel. The upper and lower leaf surfaces are similar.<ref name=\"SAL\"/>\n\nIn spring and early summer, sweetly perfumed flowers are produced in large, dense [[panicle]]s (flower spikes) {{convert|60|to|100|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, bearing well-spaced to somewhat crowded, almost [[sessility (botany)|sessile]] to sessile flowers and axes. The flowers are crowded along the ultimate branches of the panicles. The [[bract]]s which protect the developing flowers often have a distinct pink tinge before the flowers open. In south [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] and [[North Otago]] the bracts are green.<ref name=\"PCN\"/><ref name=\"FNZ\"/><ref name=\"S76\"/>\n\nThe individual flowers are {{convert|5|to|6|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} in diameter, the [[tepal]]s are free almost to the base, and reflexed. The [[stamen]]s are about the same length as the tepals.

They serve to anchor the plant and to store [[fructose]] in the form of [[fructan]]. When young, the rhizomes are mostly fleshy and are made up of thin-walled storage cells. They grow from a layer called the secondary thickening [[meristem]].<ref name=\"S98\"/>\n\n===Regional diversity===\n[[Image:Cabbage Tree Flowers.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Large branched flower spikes coming out of the top of a tree.

Each inflorescence bears 5,000 to 10,000 sweetly perfumed flowers and may produce up to 40,000 seeds.]]\n\nNew Zealand's native ''Cordyline'' species are relics of an influx of tropical plants that arrived from the north 15 million years ago in the warm [[Miocene]] era.<ref name=\"S41\"/> Because it has evolved in response to the local climate, geology and other factors, ''C.&nbsp;australis'' varies in appearance from place to place. This variation can alter the overall appearance of the tree, canopy shape and branch size, the relative shape and size of the leaves, and their colour and stiffness. There may also be invisible adaptations for resistance to disease or insect attack.<ref name=\"S68\"/> Some of these regional provenances are different enough to have been named by North Island M\u0101ori: T\u012bt\u012b in the north, t\u012b manu in the central uplands, tarariki in the east and wharanui in the west.<ref name=\"S71\"/>\nIn [[Northland Region|Northland]], ''C.&nbsp;australis'' shows a great deal of genetic diversity\u2014suggesting it is where old genetic lines have endured.<ref name=\"S58\"/> Some trees in the far north have floppy, narrow leaves, which botanist Philip Simpson attributes to hybridisation with ''[[Cordyline pumilio|C.&nbsp;pumilio]]'', the dwarf cabbage tree.<ref name=\"S69\"/> In eastern Northland, ''C.&nbsp;australis'' generally has narrow, straight dark green leaves, but some trees have much broader leaves than normal and may have hybridised with the Three Kings cabbage tree, ''C.&nbsp;obtecta'', which grows at [[North Cape, New Zealand|North Cape]] and on nearby islands. These ''obtecta''-like characteristics appear in populations of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' along parts of the eastern coastline from the [[Karikari Peninsula]] to the [[Coromandel Peninsula]]. In western Northland and [[Auckland Region|Auckland]], a form often called t\u012bt\u012b grows. When young, t\u012bt\u012b are generally very spindly, and are common in young [[Agathis australis|kauri]] forests.<ref name=\"S70-71\"/> When growing in the open, t\u012bt\u012b can become massive trees with numerous, long thin branches and relatively short, broad leaves.<ref name=\"S70\"/>\n\nIn the central Volcanic Plateau, cabbage trees are tall, with stout, relatively unbranched stems and large stiff straight leaves. Fine specimens are found along the upper [[Whanganui River]]. On old trees, the leaves tend to be relatively broad. The leaves radiate strongly, suggesting that t\u012b manu is adapted to the cold winters of the upland central plateau. It may have originated in the open country created by [[lava]], [[volcanic ash]], and [[pumice]]. Trees of the t\u012b manu type are also found in northern [[Taranaki]], the [[King Country]] and the [[Bay of Plenty]] lowlands.<ref name=\"S70-71\"/>\n\nTarariki are found in the east of the North Island from [[East Cape]] to the [[Wairarapa]]. M\u0101ori valued the narrow spiky leaves as a source of particularly tough, durable fibre. Tarariki's strong leaf fibres may be an adaptation to the region's hot, dry summers. In parts of the Wairarapa, the trees are particularly spiky, with stiff leaves and partially rolled leaf-blades. The trees near East Cape, by contrast, have leaves that hang laxly on the tree. In [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]], some trees have greener, broader leaves, and this may be because of wharanui characteristics brought in across the main divide through the [[Manawatu Gorge]].<ref name=\"S69, 71\"/>\n\nWharanui grow to the west of the North Island's main divide. They have long, broad flaccid leaves, which may be an adaptation to persistent westerly winds. The wharanui type occurs in [[Wellington]], [[Horowhenua]] and [[Whanganui]], and extends with some modifications to the southern [[Taranaki]] coast.<ref name=\"S69, 71\"/> In Taranaki, cabbage trees generally have a compact canopy with broad straight leaves.<ref name=\"S72\"/> In the South Island, wharanui is the most common form, but it is variable. The typical form grows, with little variation, from [[Cape Campbell]] to the northern [[Catlins]], and from the eastern coast to the foothills of the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]]. In [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]]'s [[Wairau Valley]], cabbage trees tend to retain their old, dead leaves, lending them an untidy appearance. The climate there is an extreme one, with hot, dry summers and cold winters.<ref name=\"S70\"/>\n\nIn north-west [[Tasman Region|Nelson]], there are three [[ecotype]]s defined by soil and exposure. Trees growing on limestone bluffs have stiff, blue-green leaves. On the river flats, the trees are tall with narrow, lax, dark green leaves, and an uneven canopy. They resemble the cabbage trees of the North Island's East Cape. Along the coast to the far west, the trees are robust with broad, bluish leaves. The latter two forms extend down the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]], with the lax-leaved forms growing in moist, fertile, sheltered river valleys while the bluish-leaved forms prefer rocky slopes exposed to the full force of the salt-laden coastal winds.<ref name=\"S70-71\"/>\n\n[[File:Futuro house Warrington.JPG|thumb|right|Cabbage trees surround a [[Futuro]] house in [[Warrington, New Zealand|Warrington]], Otago]] In [[Otago]], cabbage trees gradually become less common towards the south until they come to an end in the northern Catlins.<ref name=\"S66\"/> They reappear on the south coast at [[Waikawa, Southland]], but they are not the wharanui type. Rather they are vigorous trees with broad, green leaves and broad canopies. They extend along the coast towards [[Fiordland]], and inland to the margins of some of the [[glacier]]-fed lakes. Very vigorous when they are young, these trees seem well adapted to the very cold winters of the south.<ref name=\"S71\"/>\n\nA study of seedlings grown from seed collected in 28 areas showed a north-south change in leaf shape and dimensions. Seedling leaves get longer and narrower southwards. Seedlings often have leaves with red-brown pigmentation which disappears in older plants, and this coloration becomes increasingly common towards the south. The changes in shape\u2014leaves getting narrower and more robust from north to south and from lowland to [[montane]]\u2014suggest adaptations to colder weather.<ref name=\"S73\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy and names==\n[[Image:Cabbage-tree-inflorescence-branching-order.png|thumb|alt=Diagram showing a large branch, numbered 1, with a secondary branch numbered 2, which in turn produces tertiary branches numbered 3 smaller sub-branches numbered 4, one of which in turn produces a side branch numbered 5. Flowers appear at the ends of branches numbered 3, 4, and 5| The inflorescence of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' usually has four levels of branching: 1: the main stem; 2: the side branches (10 to 50); 3: flower-bearing branches (100 to 500); 4: the single flowers themselves (thousands); 5: sometimes the largest side branches have a fifth level of branching]]\n\n''Cordyline australis'' was collected in 1769 by [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] and [[Daniel Solander|Dr Daniel Solander]], naturalists on the ''[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' during Lieutenant [[James Cook]]'s [[First voyage of James Cook|first voyage]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]].<ref name=\"MNZ\"/> The type locality is [[Queen Charlotte Sound (New Zealand)|Queen Charlotte Sound]].<ref name=\"FNZ\"/> It was named ''Dracaena australis'' by [[Georg Forster]] who published it as entry 151 in his ''Florulae Insularum Australium Prodromus'' of 1786.<ref name=\"IPN\"/> It is sometimes still sold as a ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'', particularly for the house plant market in Northern Hemisphere countries.\n\nThe genus name ''Cordyline'' derives from an [[Ancient Greek]] word for a club (''kordyle''), a reference to the enlarged underground stems or [[rhizome]]s,<ref name=\"ANB\"/> while the species name ''australis'' is [[Latin]] for \"southern\". The common name ''cabbage tree'' is attributed by some sources to early settlers having used the young leaves as a substitute for cabbage.<ref name=\"P\"/> However the name probably predates the settlement of New Zealand \u2014 Georg Forster, writing in his ''Voyage round the World'' of 1777 about the events of Friday, April 23, 1773, refers on page 114 to the discovery of a related species in [[Fiordland]] as \"not the true cabbage palm\" and says \"the central shoot, when quite tender, tastes something like an almond's kernel, with a little of the flavour of cabbage.\"<ref name=\"F\"/> Forster may have been referring to the [[cabbage palmetto]] (''Sabal palmetto'') of Florida, which resembles the Cordyline somewhat, and was named for the cabbage-like appearance of its terminal bud.\n\n''Cordyline australis'' is the tallest of New Zealand's five native ''Cordyline'' species. Of these, the commonest are ''[[Cordyline banksii|C.&nbsp;banksii]]'', which has a slender, sweeping trunk, and ''[[Cordyline indivisa|C.&nbsp;indivisa]]'', a handsome plant with a trunk up to {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=off}} tall bearing a massive head of broad leaves up to {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long.<ref name=\"P\"/> In the far north of New Zealand, ''C.&nbsp;australis'' can be distinguished by its larger heavily branched tree form, narrower leaves and smaller seeds from ''[[Cordyline obtecta|C.&nbsp;obtecta]]'', the Three Kings cabbage tree,<ref name=\"S77\"/> its closest relative.<ref name=\"S95\"/> ''C.&nbsp;australis'' is rather variable, and forms from the northern offshore islands may be hybrids with ''C.&nbsp;obtecta''.<ref name=\"PCN\"/> Hybrids with ''[[Cordyline pumilio|C.&nbsp;pumilio]]'' and ''C.&nbsp;banksii'' also occur often where the plants are in close vicinity, because they flower at about the same time and share the [[chromosome number]] 2n=38, with ''C.&nbsp;australis''.<ref name=\"S77\"/>\n\nThe tree was well known to [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] before its scientific discovery. The generic [[M\u0101ori language]] term for plants in the genus ''Cordyline'' is ''t\u012b'', and names recorded as specific to ''C.&nbsp;australis'' include ''t\u012b k\u014duka'', ''t\u012b k\u0101uka'', ''t\u012b r\u0101kau'', ''t\u012b awe'', ''t\u012b pua'', and ''t\u012b whanake''.<ref name=\"FNZ\"/><ref name=\"WIL\"/><ref name=\"B\"/> Each tribe had names for the tree depending on its local uses and characteristics. Simpson reports that the names highlight the characteristics of the tree that were important to M\u0101ori.<ref name=\"S143\"/> These include what the plant looked like\u2014whether it was a large tree (''t\u012b r\u0101kau'', ''t\u012b pua''), the whiteness of its flowers (''t\u012b puatea''), whether its leaves were broad (''t\u012b wharanui''), twisted along the edges (''t\u012b tahanui''), or spiky (''t\u012b tarariki''). Other names refer to its uses\u2014whether its fruit attracted birds (''t\u012b manu''), or the leaves were particularly suitable for making ropes (''t\u012b whanake'') and nets (''t\u012b kupenga''). The most widely used name, ''t\u012b k\u014duka'', refers to the use of the leaf hearts as food.<ref name=\"S143-145\"/>\n\n==Ecology==\n[[Image:Redcrown in Cabbage Tree.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A parakeet eating small white flowers|A k\u0101k\u0101riki|A k\u0101k\u0101riki|A [[k\u0101k\u0101riki]] feeding on flowers of ''Cordyline australis'' on [[Tiritiri Matangi Island]]. The parakeets are often seen foraging in cabbage trees on the island]]\n\n===Habitat===\nA quote from Philip Simpson sums up the wide range of habitats the cabbage tree occupied in early New Zealand, and how much its abundance and distinctive form shaped the impression travellers received of the country:\n<blockquote>\"In primeval New Zealand cabbage trees occupied a range of habitats, anywhere open, moist, fertile and warm enough for them to establish and mature: with forest; around the rocky coast; in lowland swamps, around the lakes and along the lower rivers; and perched on isolated rocks. Approaching the land from the sea would have reminded a Polynesian traveller of home, and for a European traveller, conjured up images of the tropical Pacific\".<ref name=\"S57\"/></blockquote>\n\n''Cordyline australis'' occurs from North Cape to the very south of the South Island, where it becomes less and less common,<ref name=\"S67\"/> until it reaches its southernmost natural limits at Sandy Point (46\u00b0 30' S), west of [[Invercargill]] near [[Oreti Beach]]. It is absent from much of Fiordland, probably because there is no suitable habitat, and is unknown on the subantarctic islands to the south of New Zealand, probably because it is too cold. It occurs on some offshore islands\u2014[[Poor Knights Islands|Poor Knights]], Stewart and the Chathams\u2014but was probably introduced by M\u0101ori. In the Stewart Island region, it is rare,<ref name=\"DCF\"/> growing only on certain islands, headlands and former settlement sites where it may have been introduced by [[Sooty shearwater|muttonbird]] collectors,<ref name=\"S67, 142\"/> while on the Chatham Islands it is also largely \"a notable absentee\".<ref name=\"DAW\"/>\n\nGenerally a lowland species, it grows from sea level to about {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=off}}, reaching its upper limits on the volcanoes of the central North Island, where eruptions have created open spaces for it to exploit, and in the foothills of the Southern Alps in the South Island, where deforestation may have played a part in giving it room to grow. In the central North Island, it has evolved a much sturdier form (with the [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] name ''t\u012b manu'', meaning \"with branches bearing broad, straight upright leaves\").<ref name=\"S52-53\"/> This form resembles that found in the far south of the South Island, suggesting that they are both adapted to cold conditions.<ref name=\"S67\"/>\n\n''Cordyline australis'' is a light-demanding pioneer species, and seedlings die when overtopped by other trees. To grow well, young plants require open space so they are not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides unless there is a seepage area. The fertility of the soil is another factor\u2014settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why ''C.&nbsp;australis'' is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.<ref name=\"S53-54\"/>\n\nEarly European explorers of New Zealand described \"jungles of cabbage trees\" along the banks of streams and rivers, in huge swamps and lowland valleys. Few examples of this former abundance survive today\u2014such areas were the first to be cleared by farmers looking for flat land and fertile soil.<ref name=\"S54-55\"/> In modern New Zealand, cabbage trees usually grow as isolated individuals rather than as parts of a healthy ecosystem.<ref name=\"S68\"/>\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Kereru (New Zealand Wood Pigeon).jpg|thumb|alt=A New Zealand pigeon stands on the fruiting spike of a cabbage tree|A [[New Zealand pigeon]] feeds on the small white fruit of a cabbage tree, [[Dunedin]], August 2009. Native pigeons were once the major dispersers of the tree's seeds, which they eat in autumn and winter. Note also the notches cut out of the leaves by larvae of ''[[Epiphryne verriculata]]'', the cabbage tree moth]]\nThe cabbage tree's year begins in autumn among the tight spike of unopened leaves projecting from the centre of each tuft of leaves. Some of the growing tips have changed from making leaves to producing [[inflorescence]]s for the coming spring, and around these, two or three buds begin to produce leaves. The inflorescence and the leaf buds pass the winter protected by the enveloping spike of unopened leaves.<ref name=\"S89\"/> Months later in spring or early summer, it bears its flowers on the outside of the tree, exposed to insects and birds.<ref name=\"S108\"/> \n\nFlowering takes place over a period of four to six weeks, giving maximum exposure to pollinating insects.<ref name=\"S109\"/> The flowers produce a sweet perfume which attracts large numbers of insects. The nectar produced by the flowers contains aromatic compounds, mainly [[ester]]s and [[terpene]]s, which are particularly attractive to moths. Bees use the nectar to produce a light honey to feed their young and increase the size of the hive in the early summer.<ref name=\"S110\"/> It takes about two months for the fruit to ripen, and by the end of summer a cabbage tree can have thousands of small fruits available for birds to eat and disperse. The strong framework of the inflorescence can easily bear the weight of heavy birds like the New Zealand pigeon, which was formerly the major disperser of the seeds. \n\nEach fruit contains three to six shiny, black seeds which are coated in a charcoal-like substance called [[phytomelan]]. The latter may serve to protect the seeds from the digestive process in the gut of a bird. The seeds are also rich in [[linoleic acid]] as a food source for the developing embryo plant, a compound which is also important in the egg-laying cycle of birds.<ref name=\"S112\"/> Because it takes about two years for a particular stem to produce an inflorescence, cabbage trees tend to flower heavily in alternative years, with a bumper flowering every three to five years.<ref name=\"S111\"/> Each inflorescence bears 5,000 to 10,000 flowers, so a large inflorescence may carry about 40,000 seeds, or one million seeds for the whole tree in a good flowering year\u2014hundreds of millions for a healthy grove of trees.<ref name=\"S108, 112\"/>\n\n===Response to fire===\n''Cordyline australis'' is one of the few New Zealand forest trees that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the protected rhizomes under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a fertile soil around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers to make the most of the light and space opened up by the flames.<ref name=\"S67\"/>\n\nOlder trees sometimes grow [[epicormic shoot]]s directly from their trunks after storm or fire damage. Aerial rhizomes can also be produced from the trunk if it sustains damage or has become hollow, and grow down into the soil to regenerate the plant. Such regeneration can lead to trees of great age with multiple trunks.<ref name=\"S98-100\"/>\n\n===Biodiversity===\n[[Image:Cabbagetreebark2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Close-up of a tree trunk covered with rough bark |The corky, fissured bark of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' feels spongy to the touch]]\nMany plants and animals are associated with ''C.&nbsp;australis'' in healthy ecosystems. The most common [[epiphyte]]s are ferns, astelias and orchids. Old trees often carry large clumps of the climbing fern ''[[Asplenium]]'', and in moist places, filmy ferns and kidney ferns cling to the branches. ''[[Astelia]]'' species and ''[[Collospermum hastatum|Collospermum]]'' often establish in the main fork of the tree, and one tree can host several species of native orchid. Other common epiphytes include ''[[Griselinia lucida]]'', as well as a range of mosses, liverworts, lichens and fungi. Two fungus species which infect living tissue\u2014''[[Phanaerochaeta cordylines]]'' and ''[[Sphaeropsis cordylines]]''\u2014occur almost exclusively on ''C.&nbsp;australis''.<ref name=\"S80-82\"/>\n\nAnimals and birds associated with ''C.&nbsp;australis'' include lizards which forage among the flowers, including the [[gold-striped gecko]] which is well camouflaged for life among the leaves of the tree.<ref name=\"S82-83\"/> [[New Zealand bellbird]]s like to nest under the dead leaves or among the flower stalks, and [[paradise shelduck]]s commonly build their nests in the base of an old cabbage tree standing in the middle of a field. [[Red-crowned parakeet]]s are often seen foraging in cabbage trees.<ref name=\"CAT\"/> In South Canterbury, [[New Zealand long-tailed bat|long-tailed bat]]s shelter during the day in the hollow branches, which would once have provided nesting holes for many birds.<ref name=\"S82-83\"/>\n\nThe berries of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' are enjoyed by bellbirds, [[Tui (bird)|tui]] and [[New Zealand pigeon|pigeon]]s.<ref name=\"M\"/> M\u0101ori sometimes planted groves of cabbage trees ({{lang|mi|p\u0101 t\u012b}}) to attract pigeons which could be snared when they came to eat the berries.<ref name=\"S150\"/> Reminiscing in 1903 about life in New Zealand sixty or more years earlier, George Clarke describes how such a [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] grove of cabbage trees would attract huge numbers of pigeons: \"About four miles from our house, there was a great preserve of wood pigeons, that was made as tapu as the native chiefs could devise. At a certain season, the pigeons came in vast flocks to feed on the white berries of the Ti tree (brac\u0153na) [sic] and got so heavy with fat that they could hardly fly from one tree to another. No gun was allowed in the place. The Maoris, with a long slender rod and a slip noose at the end, squatted under the leaves and noiselessly slipped the noose over the necks of the stupid pigeons as they were feeding.\"<ref name=\"CLK\"/> As the native birds have vanished from much of New Zealand with the clearing of forests, it is now flocks of [[European starling|starling]]s which descend upon the fruit.<ref name=\"S82-83\"/>\n\nThe nectar of the flowers is sought after by insects, bellbirds, tui, and [[stitchbird]]s. The leaves and the rough bark provide excellent homes for insects such as caterpillars and moths, small beetles, fly larvae, [[weta]], snails and slugs. Many of these are then eaten by birds such as [[saddleback (bird)|saddleback]]s and [[North Island robin|robin]]s. The rough bark also provides opportunities for epiphytes to cling and grow, and lizards hide amongst the dead leaves, coming out to drink the nectar and to eat the insects.<ref name=\"STP\"/><ref name=\"SAL\"/> Good flowering seasons occur every few years only. While it is said that they foretell dry summers, it has been observed that they tend to follow dry seasons.<ref name=\"P\"/>\n\nInsects, including beetles, moths, wasps and flies, use the bark, leaves and flowers of the tree in various ways. Some feed or hide camouflaged in the skirt of dead leaves, a favourite dry place for weta to hide in winter. Many of the insect companions of the tree have followed it into the domesticated surroundings of parks and home gardens.<ref name=\"S83-84\"/> If the leaves are left to decay, the soil underneath cabbage trees becomes a black humus that supports a rich array of amphipods, earthworms and millipedes.<ref name=\"S86\"/>\n\nThere are nine species of insect only found on ''C.&nbsp;australis'', of which the best known is ''[[Epiphryne verriculata]]'', the cabbage tree moth, which is perfectly adapted to hide on a dead leaf. Its caterpillars eat large holes and wedges in the leaves. The moth lays its eggs at the base of the central spike of unopened leaves. The caterpillars eat holes in the surface of the leaves and leave characteristic notches in the leaf margins. They can infest young trees but seldom damage older trees, which lack the skirt of dead leaves where the parent moths like to hide.<ref name=\"S84\"/>\n\n==Threats, pests and diseases==\n\n===Sudden decline===\n[[File:Sudden Decline.jpg|thumb|alt=Dead tree standing in a rural field|Sudden Decline has decimated populations of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' in some parts of New Zealand]]\nCases of sick and dying trees of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' were first reported in the northern part of the North Island in 1987. The syndrome, eventually called Sudden Decline, soon reached epidemic proportions in Northland and Auckland. Affected trees usually suffer total defoliation within 2 to 12 months. The foliage turns yellow, and the oldest leaves wither and fall off. Growth of leaves ceases, and eventually all the leaves fall, leaving dead branches, often with the dried-out flowering panicles still attached. At the same time, the bark on the trunk becomes loose and detaches easily. The greatest number of dead trees (18 to 26 percent) was recorded around Auckland.<ref name=\"RG\"/>\n\nFor some years, the cause of the disease was unknown, and hypotheses included tree ageing, fungi, viruses, and environmental factors such as an increase in ultra-violet light.<ref name=\"DCF\"/> Another hypothesis was that a genetic problem may have been induced in Northland and Auckland by the thousands of cabbage trees brought into the area from elsewhere and planted in gardens and parks.<ref name=\"S68\"/> The [[Department of Survey and Land Information|Lands and Survey Department]] had a native plant nursery at [[Taupo]] in the central North Island, which was used to grow plants for use in parks, reserves and carparks. In many Northland parks, cabbage trees from the central North Island were growing and flowering within metres of natural forms. Any offspring produced might have been poorly adapted to local conditions.<ref name=\"S69\"/> After nearly five years of work, scientists found the cause was a bacterium ''[[Phytoplasma|Phytoplasma australiense]]'', which may be spread from tree to tree by a tiny sap-sucking insect, the introduced [[Scolypopa australis|passion vine hopper]].\n\nPopulations of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' were decimated in some parts of New Zealand because of Sudden Decline. In some areas, particularly in the north, no big trees are left. Although Sudden Decline often affects cabbage trees in farmland and open areas, trees in natural forest patches continue to do well. Trees in the southern North Island and northern South Island are generally unaffected with few dead branches and no symptoms of Sudden Decline. By 2010, there was evidence to suggest the severity of the disease was lessening.<ref name=\"PCN\"/><ref name=\"DCF\"/><ref name=\"RG\"/>\n\n===Rural decline===\nThe plight of ''Cordyline australis'' in the Sudden Decline epidemic drew attention to another widespread threat to the tree in rural areas throughout New Zealand.<ref name=\"S10\"/> Rural Decline was the name proposed by botanists to refer to a decline in health of older trees in pasture and grazed shrubland, leading over many years to the loss of upper branches and eventual death.\n\nOften farmers would leave a solitary cabbage tree\u2014or even groves of trees\u2014standing after the swamps were drained. Most of these trees will slowly die out because livestock eat the seedlings and damage the trunks and roots of adult trees.<ref name=\"PCN\"/><ref name=\"S80-86\"/> When a cabbage tree is the only shade in a field, stock will shelter underneath it, damaging the bark by rubbing against it, and compacting the soil around the tree. Cows, sheep, goats, and deer eat the nutritious tissue under the bark of cabbage trees.<ref name=\"S87, 267\"/> Once the trunk has been damaged by animals, it seldom heals and the wounds get bigger over time. Eventually the tissue in the centre of the stem rots away and a cavity forms along its entire length. The trunk becomes misshapen or completely ring-barked for a metre above the ground. Often the growth layer dies and the injuries may lead to bacterial or fungal infections that spread into the branches until the canopy too begins to die.<ref name=\"S267\"/> Other factors thought to contribute to Rural Decline include wood-rotting fungi like ''Phanerochaete cordylines'', micro-organisms which cause [[Detritivore|saprobic decay]] and leaf-feeding caterpillars.<ref name=\"BEE65\"/>\n\nOther mammals can be destructive. [[Common brushtail possum (New Zealand)|Possums]] tend not to eat the leaves of the tree, but are very fond of eating the sugar-rich flowering stalks as they emerge. They also like using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more destructive, especially during periods of drought, when they have been seen to eat through the base until a tree falls, and then eating the fallen tree completely. Horses can also fell a tree by eating through the trunk.<ref name=\"S87, 267\"/>\n\n==M\u0101ori cultural uses==\n[[Image:SwingAngas1847.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Early 19th century coloured drawing showing Maori children swinging from long ropes coming from the top of a high pole while a group of adults watches them|Morere swings provided a source of amusement for M\u0101ori children. The ropes had to be strong, so they were often made from leaves or fibre of ''C.&nbsp;australis'', which were much tougher than the fibres of New Zealand flax]]\nIn traditional times, M\u0101ori had a rich knowledge of the cabbage tree, including spiritual, ecological and many practical aspects of its use. While much of that specialised knowledge was lost after the European settlement of New Zealand, the use of the tree as food and medicine has persisted, and the use of its fibres for weaving is becoming more common.<ref name=\"S143\"/>\n\n===Food===\nThe stems and fleshy rhizomes of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' are high in natural sugars and were steam-cooked in [[earth oven]]s (''umu t\u012b'', a large type of ''[[h\u0101ngi]]'') to produce ''k\u0101uru'', a carbohydrate-rich food used to sweeten other foods. The growing tips or leaf hearts were stripped of leaves and eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable, when they were called ''k\u014duka''\u2014the origin of the M\u0101ori name of the tree.<ref name=\"STP\"/><ref name=\"O\"/> The southern limit of [[Sweet potato|kumara]] (sweet potato) cultivation was at [[Banks Peninsula]] at 43\u00b0S, and south of there a culture developed around ''C.&nbsp;australis''. Natural and planted groves of the cabbage tree were harvested.<ref name=\"S66\"/>\n\nLarge parties trimmed the cut stems, and left them to dry for days or weeks.<ref name=\"O\"/><ref name=\"H\"/> As well as stems, the rhizomes\u2014extensions of the trunk below the surface of the ground shaped like enormous carrots\u2014were also dug up to be cooked. In the early 1840s, Edward Shortland said M\u0101ori preferred rhizomes from trees growing in deep rich soil. They dug them in spring or early summer just before the flowering of the plant, when they were at their sweetest.<ref name=\"P\"/> November was the favourite month for preparing k\u0101uru in the South Island.<ref name=\"C174-175\"/>\n\nAfter drying, the harvested stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 hours or more in the umu t\u012b pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate [[fructan]] in the stems to very sweet [[fructose]]. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then flattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. K\u0101uru could be stored dry until the time came to add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. K\u0101uru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to smell and taste like [[molasses]].<ref name=\"P\"/><ref name=\"O\"/><ref name=\"H\"/><ref name=\"SCH12\"/>\n\nEvidence of large cooking pits (umu t\u012b) can still be found in the hills of [[Canterbury, New Zealand|South Canterbury]] and [[North Otago]], where large groves of cabbage trees still stand.<ref name=\"S66\"/> Europeans used the plant to make alcohol, and the often fearsome brews were relished by whalers and sealers.<ref name=\"SCH12\"/>\n\nThe k\u014data, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as medicine. When cooked, it was called the k\u014duka.<ref name=\"S146, 150\"/> If the spike of unopened leaves and a few outer leaves is gripped firmly at the base and bent, it will snap off. The leaves can be removed, and what remains is like a small artichoke heart that can be steamed, roasted or boiled to make k\u014duka, a bitter vegetable available at any time of the year. K\u014duka is delicious as a relish with fatty foods like eel, [[Sooty shearwater|muttonbirds]], or pigeons, or in modern times, pork, mutton and beef. Different trees were selected for their degree of bitterness, which should be strong for medicinal use, but less so when used as a vegetable.<ref name=\"S150\"/>\n\n===Fibre===\nA tough fibre was extracted from the leaves of ''C.&nbsp;australis'', and was valued for its strength and durability especially in seawater. The leaves were\nused for making anchor ropes and fishing lines, cooking mats, baskets, sandals and leggings for protection when travelling in the South Island high country, home of the prickly speargrasses (''[[Aciphylla]]'') and t\u016bmatakuru or matagouri (''[[Discaria toumatou]]'').<ref name=\"SCH11\"/> Morere swings provided a source of amusement for M\u0101ori children. The ropes had to be strong, so they were often made from the leaves or fibre of ''C.&nbsp;australis'', which were much tougher than the fibres of [[Phormium tenax|New Zealand flax]].<ref name=\"S160\"/> The leaves were also used for rain capes, although the mountain cabbage tree ''C.&nbsp;indivisa'', was preferred.<ref name=\"SCH11\"/> The fibre made from cabbage tree leaves is stronger than that made from [[Phormium tenax|New Zealand flax]].<ref name=\"STP\"/><ref name=\"O\"/>\n\n===Medicine===\nThe M\u0101ori used various parts of ''Cordyline australis'' to treat injuries and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste.<ref name=\"STP\"/> The k\u014data, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser.<ref name=\"S150\"/> Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion of the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains.<ref name=\"MUP\"/> The seeds of ''Cordyline australis'' are high in [[linoleic acid]], one of the essential fatty acids.<ref name=\"MUP\"/>\n\n==Cultivation today==\n[[Image:Palms in Alderney.JPG|thumb|alt=A grove of trees with lots of long strap-like leaves, through which the sea and a boat can be seen|''C.&nbsp;australis'' is widely cultivated outside New Zealand.

In Northwest Europe and other cool [[Oceanic climate|oceanic climates]], it is very popular as an ornamental tree because it looks like a palm tree.<ref name=\"S70-74\"/> Hardy forms from the coldest areas of the southern or inland South Island tolerate Northern Hemisphere conditions best, while North Island forms are much more tender.<ref name=\"HBS\"/> It is easily grown from fresh seed \u2014 seedlings often spontaneously appear in gardens from bird-dispersed seed \u2014 and can be grown very easily from shoot, stem and even trunk cuttings.

Although not a palm, it is locally named Cornish palm, Manx palm or Torbay palm. The last name is due to its extensive use in Torbay, it being the official symbol of that area, used in tourist posters promoting South Devon as the English Riviera. It also grows in Spain, Italy and Japan.<ref name=\"G\"/> Even though its natural distribution ranges from 34\u00b0 S to 46\u00b0S, and despite its ultimately tropical origins, it also grows at about five degrees from the Arctic Circle in Masfjorden, Norway, latitude 61\u00baN, in a microclimate protected from arctic winds and moderated by the Gulf Stream.<ref name=\"GFC\"/>\n\n===Cultivars===\n[[Image:Cordyline australis 'Red Star' 01.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A potted plant with lots of red strap-like leaves growing in a pebble-covered garden bed|The cultivar ''Cordyline'' 'Red Star' has dark reddish bronze leaves]]\nIn the North Island,<ref name=\"W\"/> M\u0101ori cultivated selected forms of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' for food.<ref name=\"S145\"/> One of these, called t\u012b para or t\u012b t\u0101whiti, was grown because it suckers readily and forms multiple fleshy rhizomes. A dwarf non-flowering selection of ''C.&nbsp;australis'', it has a rubbery, pulpy stem, and thick green leaves. Although it was recorded by the early naturalists, botanists only rediscovered it in the 1990s, being grown by gardeners as the cultivar ''Cordyline'' 'Thomas Kirk'.<ref name=\"S145\"/> Recent and unpublished DNA work suggests it derives from ''C.&nbsp;australis'' of the central North Island.<ref name=\"SCH12-13\"/>\n\n''Cordyline'' 'Ti Tawhiti' was \"the subject of an intense discussion amongst the leading botanists of New Zealand at a meeting of the Royal Society ... in Wellington 100 years ago. It was saved from extinction because its dwarf form found favour with gardeners and it came to be known as Cordyline 'Kirkii' recording the interest Thomas Kirk had in the plant. Its origin as a Maori selection was forgotten until rediscovered in 1991. The name 'Tawhiti' is equivalent to 'Hawaiki' and indicates the traditional belief that the plant was introduced to [[Aotearoa]] by the ancestral canoes of Maori. However, it is more probable that the name arose from it being moved around its native land as a domesticated plant.\"<ref name=\"H\"/>\n\nNumerous [[cultivars]] of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' are sold within New Zealand and around the world.<ref name=\"PCN\"/><ref name=\"P\"/> Like other ''Cordyline'' species, ''C.&nbsp;australis'' can produce [[mutation|sports]] which have very attractive colouration, including pink stripes and leaves in various shades of green, yellow or red. An early cultivar was published in France and England in 1870: ''Cordyline australis'' 'Lentiginosa' was described as having tinted leaves with brownish red spots. Other early cultivars included 'Veitchii' (1871) with crimson midribs, 'Atrosanguinea' (1882) with bronze leaves infused with red, 'Atropurpurea' (1886) and 'Purpurea' (1890) with purple leaves, and a range of variegated forms: 'Doucetiana' (1878), 'Argento-striata' (1888) and 'Dalleriana' (1890). In New Zealand and overseas, hybrids with other ''Cordyline'' species feature prominently in the range of cultivars available. [[New Plymouth]] plant breeders Duncan and Davies included hybrids of ''C.&nbsp;australis'' and ''C.&nbsp;banksii'' in their 1925 catalogue, and have produced many new cultivars since. In New Zealand, some of the coloured forms and hybrids seem to be more susceptible to attacks from the cabbage tree moth.<ref name=\"G\"/><ref name=\"S250-251\"/>\n\nImmature forms have become a popular annual house or ornamental plant under the name 'Spikes', or ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'' 'Spikes'. \n<ref name=fg>[http://www.finegardening.com/plantguide/cordyline-australis-purple-tower-giant-dracaena.aspx Fine Gardening: Cordyline australis 'Purple Tower' (Giant dracaena, New Zealand cabbage palm)]</ref> To add to the confusion, these may be misidentified as ''[[Cordyline indivisa]]'' ([[Synonym (taxonomy)|syn.]] ''Dracaena indivisa'').<ref>[http://www.denverplants.com/annual/html/drace_ind.htm Denver Plants: Dracaena indivisa]</ref>\n\n''C. australis'' is hardy to [[Hardiness zone|USDA zones]] 8\u201311.<ref>Dave's Garden - Cabbage Palm, Cabbage Tree, Ti Kouka, Torbay Palm, Dracaena Spike Cordyline australis, http://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/2237/</ref>\n\nIn cultivation in the United Kingdom, ''C. australis''<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Cordyline australis''url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=527}}</ref> and its cultivars 'Sundance',<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Cordyline australis'' 'Sundance'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=2517|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref> 'Torbay Dazzler',<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Cordyline australis'' 'Torbay Dazzler'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=2518|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref> and 'Torbay Red'<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Cordyline australis'' ''|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=4558|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref> have all gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]] (confirmed 2017).<ref>{{cite web  | url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/pdfs/agm-lists/agm-ornamentals.pdf | title = AGM Plants - Ornamental | date = July 2017 | page = 22 | publisher = Royal Horticultural Society | accessdate = 24 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Barry L.
