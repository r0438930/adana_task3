In the late 1990s, one out of every 58 people in the state was a pilot, with six airplanes for every ten pilots.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=Kevin W. |title=The Alaska Capstone Programme: Increasing Safety Through Technology |journal= FAA Aviation News: A DOT/FAA Flight Standards Safety |volume=41 |issue=7 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5yuAex76hlsC&pg=PP37 |year=November-December 2002 |pages=31-32}}</ref> With a very limited highway and railroad infrastructure, aviation emerged as the essential \u2013 and in most locations the only \u2013 transportation system. However, the vital infrastructure supporting aviation fell short of the standards commonly expected or encountered elsewhere in the US.\n\nThe [[Climate of Alaska|harsh environment of Alaska]] contributed to averages of one [[Aviation accidents and incidents|aircraft accident]] every other day, and one accident-related fatality every nine days. More than one-third of the annual [[List of accidents and incidents involving airliners in the United States|air commuter accidents in the US]] occurred in Alaska, and more than ten percent of the professional pilots working there would not survive a thirty-year career.\n\n==History==\n\n===Flight 2000 proposal and program development===\nIn early 1997, the US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) began developing a proposal entitled \"Flight 2000\". This proposal envisioned rapid deployment and field demonstration of advanced [[avionics]] capabilities leading toward implementation of [[Free flight (air traffic control)|free flight]]. The proposal was not well received by all segments of the aviation industry, and the industry's [[Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics|RTCA]] (Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics) Select Committee on Free Flight endorsed a revised approach that included most Flight 2000 program activities. The revised approach was documented in the \"Joint Government/Industry Roadmap for Free Flight Operational Enhancements\".\n\nWithin the Alaskan Region, Flight 2000 served as the \"capstone\" for many additional initiatives, providing a common umbrella for planning, coordination, focus, and direction with regard to development of the future [[National Airspace System]] (NAS). A few additional \"technology-driven\" initiatives supportive of Flight 2000 are recommended in a March 1995 [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) Alaska Safety Study, inextricably linked to the earlier proposal. As an example, the additional aviation weather observing systems the NTSB called for in Alaska relies on the Flight 2000 Flight Information System element to provide the information developed via data link to the pilot.\n\nA key objective of Flight 2000 had been to accelerate implementation and use of modern technology; however, uncertainties surrounding that program actually slowed the transition. Several Alaskan avionics installers reported customers seeking to acquire GPS equipment defer investing as they waited for Flight 2000.\n\n===Program implementation===\nWithin Alaska, Capstone linked several initiatives to coordinate between the FAA, community, and industry. Capstone outlined the process and scope for upgrading the operating infrastructure with [[airport]]s, weather products, communications, and GPS-driven systems.\n\nA major objective was to improve safety in Alaska while offering efficiencies to operators. Many accidents could be eliminated through improved situational awareness for both pilots and [[Air traffic controller|controllers]]. For this reason, the Alaskan Region supported efforts to enhance the NAS and become a test bed for new technology. A study of 112 air-carrier accidents during a three-year period in Alaska indicated a likely 38% safety improvement from modern technology.\n\nThe Free Flight Operational Enhancements Program (FFOEP) identified nine enhancements. Although field deployment of these enhancements was not scheduled to begin in Alaska until {{abbr|FY|fiscal year}}&nbsp;2000, a limited early deployment was within reach and highly desirable. It was thought that early deployment would have a positive effect on safety, create an infrastructure to permit initial procedures development, familiarize [[Aircrew|flight crews]], controllers, and avionics installers with modern equipment and concepts, and address [[Pilot certification in the United States|certification]] issues and procedures prior to the actual start of the FFOEP evaluation. Early deployment would also serve to validate the overall concept identified in the joint Government/Industry Roadmap.\n\nDuring FY&nbsp;1999, the Alaskan Region's \"Capstone\" Program tied together three of the nine principal elements identified in the \"Joint Government/Industry Roadmap for Free Flight Operational Enhancements\" with two safety initiatives from the March 1995 NTSB Alaska Safety Study. Operational enhancements included in Project Capstone are:\n* flight information system for special use airspace, weather, [[windshear]], [[NOTAM]]s (Notices to Airmen), and [[pilot report]]s\n* cost-effective [[controlled flight into terrain]] (CFIT) avoidance through graphical position display\n* enhanced \"see and avoid\" [[visual flight rules]] (VFR)\nThe concept of conducting a real-world demonstration of these and other capabilities in Alaska was originally proposed for inclusion in the FAA's Flight 2000 Program.\n\nThe Alaskan Region identified the following FFOEP elements and related NTSB safety improvements for limited deployment in FY&nbsp;1999:\n* The Alaskan Region's Capstone Program brought together several initiatives, some ongoing, some proposed, in order to make the flying community safer and more efficient while validating the deployment and operation of technology in the [[Bethel Airport|Bethel hub]] and surrounding area. It supports planning efforts of the FFOEP developed by the RTCA Select Committee by providing a cost-effective and efficient method to demonstrate the program'\u0092s implementation processes.\n* A Capstone Field Office was established in [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], reporting to the Alaskan Regional Administrator to plan, coordinate and implement the project. Infrastructure and interim procedures and certification processes would be developed in conjunction with the respective Alaskan Region Divisions responsible for them. Equipage of evaluation aircraft would be voluntary with the Capstone program absorbing the cost of equipping and certifying. Capstone built an infrastructure consistent with the FFOEP, thereby enabling further procedure development and evaluation leading toward overall modernization.\n\nThe Capstone program consisted of two phases in different geographical areas of Alaska. Phase&nbsp;I, which was conceived in 1998 and implemented in 1999, was centered in the [[Yukon\u2013Kuskokwim Delta|Yukon\u2013Kuskokwim (Y\u2013K) Delta]] area of southwestern Alaska. Phase&nbsp;II, which began in 2001, encompassed Southeast Alaska. Phase&nbsp;III would be implemented statewide using the technologies developed and proven in Phase&nbsp;I&nbsp;and&nbsp;II.\n\n====Phase I====\nThe Y\u2013K Delta area of southwestern Alaska, the focal point for Capstone's Phase&nbsp;I activities, typified most of the state in terms of transportation infrastructure. No roads connected the more than fifty villages in the {{convert|100,000|sqmi}} area, and even within the villages there were few roads. The community of [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]], the aviation hub and largest settlement in the area, had only {{convert|15|mi}} of mostly unpaved roads.\n\nUnder Phase&nbsp;I, a fleet of small commercial aircraft evaluated safety benefits of technologies during day-to-day operations in Alaska. The aircraft were fitted with [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR) capable GPS receivers, a [[Automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast#Universal access transceiver|universal access transceiver]] (UAT) data-link system that enabled [[automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast]] (ADS\u2013B), and [[flight information service]] (FIS) including real-time weather, and a multifunction display (MFD) depicting terrain, other ADS\u2013B aircraft, weather graphics and text data. The bundle of avionics were installed on 200 aircraft used for commuting, chartering, and mail flights in southwest Alaska. The avionics improved the pilot's situational awareness with the primary goal of preventing controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) and mid-air accidents.\n\nThe lack of a usable IFR infrastructure and [[radar]] coverage combined with the harsh weather conditions caused Alaska to have a high rate of CFIT accidents. Pilots, departing for VFR-only destinations with the intention of maintaining visual separation with terrain or water, continued flying toward their destination after encountering marginal weather conditions which would normally involve instrument flight operations. The terrain-awareness function of the Capstone avionics provided ground-proximity functionality. The terrain function showed terrain via an intuitive high-resolution color display using black, green, yellow and red to indicate the proximity of terrain to the aircraft. The avionics continuously monitored the aircraft's altitude, GPS-derived position, ground speed, route of flight, and compared this data to a built-in [[database]] of terrain elevation. The display automatically provided a terrain advisory to the pilot if the aircraft was within two minutes of a close encounter with the ground.\n\nSecond to CFIT accidents was mid-air collisions. Capstone sought to address this by using ADS\u2013B technology to reduce airborne collisions. ADS\u2013B-equipped aircraft continuously broadcast their position whether they are flying or [[taxiing]] on the airport surface. Displayed on the multifunction display, ADS\u2013B gave pilots a clear view of the other ADS\u2013B traffic around them. When the Capstone aircraft were flown to a radar service area, such as exists in Anchorage, a capability called [[Traffic information service - broadcast|Traffic Information Service \u2013 Broadcast]] (TIS\u2013B) depicted non-ADS\u2013B aircraft on the MFD as well.\n\nA network of data-link ground-stations has been installed at eleven existing FAA and joint-use military facilities in the Phase&nbsp;I region, and connected via existing communications systems to the [[Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center]]. The existing Micro Enroute Automated Radar Tracking System (Micro-EARTS) had been programmed to depict ADS\u2013B targets on the air traffic controller displays fused with radar targets. ADS\u2013B aircraft position reports were also made available to airport traffic controllers in Bethel and to the commercial-aircraft operators via the Internet for flight-monitoring purposes.\n\nAs part of the initial Capstone initiative, the FAA purchased, installed, and maintained the avionics for the 5-year evaluation period. In return, participants assisted the program by providing evaluation data so that safety and operational benefits could be identified and documented. Ownership of the avionics transferred to the participating operators in December 2004. The initial evaluation concentrated on an affordable means to reduce CFIT and provide the pilot with an enhanced means to see nearby traffic and receive current weather in the cockpit.\n\nThe Capstone program provided training for pilots, operators, safety inspectors, air traffic control specialists, and technicians to ensure that the greatest benefits resulting from evaluation activities were realized.\nTo support this technology, 19 GPS stand-alone non-precision instrument approach procedures were prepared and published for runways of ten remote village airports within the Phase&nbsp;I evaluation area. Also, an [[Automated airport weather station#Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS)|automated weather observation system]] (AWOS) was installed at these airports to enable air-carrier use of the new non-precision GPS instrument approach procedures.\n\nThe natural boundaries of the Y\u2013K Delta confined the operation of most of the participating aircraft to the area, with Bethel as the operating hub, and also limits the radar coverage below 6,000 feet (from sea level). Capstone provided an IFR infrastructure for Bethel and nine additional airports in the Y\u2013K Delta, and made radar-like ADS\u2013B coverage possible throughout the area. To enable [[air traffic service]]s (ATS) to use ADS\u2013B in the Bethel non-radar environment, Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center's equipment was modified to display ADS\u2013B data together with available radar on the air traffic controller display.\n\nTo document the results, Capstone enlisted the help of the [[University of Alaska at Anchorage]] (UAA) and the [[MITRE Corporation]]. The university documented a baseline of current operations and tracked, evaluated and documented the improvements as they occurred. UAA also provided crew training on the Capstone avionics equipment. The initial results showed a 40 percent reduction in accidents had resulted from the Capstone Program.\n\n====Phase II====\n{{Update|section|date=August 2016}}\nUnder Phase&nbsp;II, the Capstone Program concentrated efforts in the terrain-constrained area of Southeast Alaska. Again, in partnership with the aviation industry, Capstone worked to improve safety and access to that area using lessons learned from the Phase&nbsp;I program in the Y\u2013K Delta, as well as incorporating other technologies to further improve surveillance and navigation capability. Phase&nbsp;II also included a demonstration of technology aimed at reducing the potential for [[runway incursion]] accidents. In addition to the CFIT and mid-air concerns one of the critical elements needed in Southeast Alaska was a usable IFR infrastructure.\n\nSoutheast Alaska is a very rugged environment of mountains and ocean. Forested islands create the state's famous [[Inside Passage]]. In many areas the ocean comes directly up to the base of tall, majestic mountains capped by [[glacier]]s and [[ice field]]s. Although access to most settlements in the Southeast is available by boat, the lengthy travel time makes it impractical for everyday and emergency use. A less-than-two-hour journey from [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] by air requires sixteen hours by boat, and a voyage on the ferry from [[Bellingham, Washington]] to Juneau, Alaska takes over 50 hours.\n\nOver 45 communities are scattered throughout Southeast Alaska on islands and the mainland. Juneau, the capital, is the largest. Only three of the cities, [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]] and [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]], are reachable by road via the [[Alaska Highway|Alaska\u2013Canadian Highway]]. Even these, because of the lengthy drive, depend on aviation for most of their transportation needs.\n\nFlying in this area was very different due to the constraints of the terrain. The [[Minimum en route altitude|Minimum En Route Altitude]] (MEA) of the airways were typically above the altitudes that the general aviation fleet of aircraft could safely fly without encountering icing conditions, even in the summer.\n\nLegacy en route navigation aids required land-based sites where power was available and maintenance crews had access. This land-based system resulted in a traditional IFR route structure that was not optimized for the terrain or typical small aircraft users in Southeast Alaska. The technology that changed this and put the routes and approaches where they were needed, at low altitudes over the [[fjord]]s, was the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS).\n\nBasic GPS service failed to meet the accuracy, availability, and integrity (the ability of a system to provide timely warnings to users or to shut itself down when it should not be used for navigation) requirements critical to safety of flight. The bottom line for assessing a navigation system is its \"availability\". A system that fails to meet prescribed standards for accuracy, integrity, or other specifications is not truly available for use, although even the raw GPS signal in Alaska was better than the FAA's legacy systems. The traditional [[VOR/DME|VHF omnidirectional range]] (VOR) and [[Radio direction finder#Automatic direction finder (ADF)|automatic direction finder]] (ADF) ground-based en-route system has an availability rate of 98.5%. The GPS signal had an availability of about 99.9% and was available over a much wider area.\n\nBeing able to receive the WAAS signal improves basic GPS accuracy to approximately 7 metres (23&nbsp;ft) vertically and horizontally, improves system availability through the use of GEOs{{expand acronym|date=March 2017}} carrying navigation payloads, and provides important integrity information about the entire GPS constellation.\n\nWAAS provides the safety-critical navigation system that will allow the Capstone program to design airways and approaches where they can be best-used by the aviation industry in Southeast Alaska. Capstone utilized WAAS receivers in all participating aircraft. The WAAS signal was the basis for new IFR routes and procedures that were designed to serve low-flying aircraft throughout Southeast Alaska. The first air-carrier validation flights by Harris Air, located at [[Sitka, Alaska]], took place in March 2005 and resulted in FAA approval.\n\nWAAS delivered the safety assurances essential for building a new U.S. navigation and air traffic management system based on more cost-effective satellite technology. The WAAS signal, which has been available for several years for non-critical use has an availability rate of 99.999%.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nCapstone worked with the WAAS program office to help provide the WAAS signal to the Phase&nbsp;II Capstone equipment. Certification and initial installations of Capstone Phase&nbsp;II WAAS avionics took place in 2002.\n\nIntroduction of WAAS-based navigation and [[surveillance]] capabilities also required new regulatory provisions. On March 13, 2003, Special Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 97 was approved by FAA authorizing en-route IFR navigation in Alaska based solely on satellite technology without reference to ground radio-navigation stations.\n\nNew WAAS routes were also designed and charted to serve the entire state of Alaska. Conflict within the Air Traffic Organization resulted in the WAAS routes being NOTAMed out of service and later removed from public charting.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===End===\nIn 2006, the FAA integrated the Alaskan Capstone project into the national Automatic Dependent Surveillance \u2013 Broadcast (ADS\u2013B) program.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fact Sheet - Alaskan Capstone Program National Surveillance and Broadcast Services Office |work=FAA Program |url=http://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=7957 |date=December 22, 2006 |accessdate=December 5, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208195932/http://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=7957 |archivedate=December 8, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1999 establishments in Alaska]]\n[[Category:2006 disestablishments in the United States]]\n[[Category:Aviation in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Aviation safety]]\n[[Category:Federal Aviation Administration]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=December 2014}}\nThe '''Capstone Program''' was a [[United States]] government-funded [[aviation safety]] program for the state of [[Alaska]], primarily focusing on rural areas of the state.

A less-than-two-hour journey from [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] by air requires sixteen hours by boat, and a voyage on the ferry from [[Bellingham, Washington]] to Juneau, Alaska takes over 50 hours.\n\nOver 45 communities are scattered throughout Southeast Alaska on islands and the mainland. Juneau, the capital, is the largest. Only three of the cities, [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]] and [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]], are reachable by road via the [[Alaska Highway|Alaska\u2013Canadian Highway]]. Even these, because of the lengthy drive, depend on aviation for most of their transportation needs.\n\nFlying in this area was very different due to the constraints of the terrain. The [[Minimum en route altitude|Minimum En Route Altitude]] (MEA) of the airways were typically above the altitudes that the general aviation fleet of aircraft could safely fly without encountering icing conditions, even in the summer.\n\nLegacy en route navigation aids required land-based sites where power was available and maintenance crews had access. This land-based system resulted in a traditional IFR route structure that was not optimized for the terrain or typical small aircraft users in Southeast Alaska. The technology that changed this and put the routes and approaches where they were needed, at low altitudes over the [[fjord]]s, was the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS).\n\nBasic GPS service failed to meet the accuracy, availability, and integrity (the ability of a system to provide timely warnings to users or to shut itself down when it should not be used for navigation) requirements critical to safety of flight. The bottom line for assessing a navigation system is its \"availability\". A system that fails to meet prescribed standards for accuracy, integrity, or other specifications is not truly available for use, although even the raw GPS signal in Alaska was better than the FAA's legacy systems. The traditional [[VOR/DME|VHF omnidirectional range]] (VOR) and [[Radio direction finder#Automatic direction finder (ADF)|automatic direction finder]] (ADF) ground-based en-route system has an availability rate of 98.5%. The GPS signal had an availability of about 99.9% and was available over a much wider area.\n\nBeing able to receive the WAAS signal improves basic GPS accuracy to approximately 7 metres (23&nbsp;ft) vertically and horizontally, improves system availability through the use of GEOs{{expand acronym|date=March 2017}} carrying navigation payloads, and provides important integrity information about the entire GPS constellation.\n\nWAAS provides the safety-critical navigation system that will allow the Capstone program to design airways and approaches where they can be best-used by the aviation industry in Southeast Alaska. Capstone utilized WAAS receivers in all participating aircraft. The WAAS signal was the basis for new IFR routes and procedures that were designed to serve low-flying aircraft throughout Southeast Alaska. The first air-carrier validation flights by Harris Air, located at [[Sitka, Alaska]], took place in March 2005 and resulted in FAA approval.\n\nWAAS delivered the safety assurances essential for building a new U.S. navigation and air traffic management system based on more cost-effective satellite technology. The WAAS signal, which has been available for several years for non-critical use has an availability rate of 99.999%.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nCapstone worked with the WAAS program office to help provide the WAAS signal to the Phase&nbsp;II Capstone equipment. Certification and initial installations of Capstone Phase&nbsp;II WAAS avionics took place in 2002.\n\nIntroduction of WAAS-based navigation and [[surveillance]] capabilities also required new regulatory provisions. On March 13, 2003, Special Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 97 was approved by FAA authorizing en-route IFR navigation in Alaska based solely on satellite technology without reference to ground radio-navigation stations.\n\nNew WAAS routes were also designed and charted to serve the entire state of Alaska. Conflict within the Air Traffic Organization resulted in the WAAS routes being NOTAMed out of service and later removed from public charting.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===End===\nIn 2006, the FAA integrated the Alaskan Capstone project into the national Automatic Dependent Surveillance \u2013 Broadcast (ADS\u2013B) program.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fact Sheet - Alaskan Capstone Program National Surveillance and Broadcast Services Office |work=FAA Program |url=http://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=7957 |date=December 22, 2006 |accessdate=December 5, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208195932/http://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=7957 |archivedate=December 8, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1999 establishments in Alaska]]\n[[Category:2006 disestablishments in the United States]]\n[[Category:Aviation in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Aviation safety]]\n[[Category:Federal Aviation Administration]]\n", "name_user": "Martinevans123", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePhase I:converts", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capstone_Program"}
