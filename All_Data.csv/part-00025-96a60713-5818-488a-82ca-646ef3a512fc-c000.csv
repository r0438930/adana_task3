'''Prostitution in Singapore''' in itself is not illegal, but various prostitution-related activities are criminalized. This includes public solicitation, living on the earnings of a prostitute and maintaining a brothel. In practice, police unofficially tolerate and monitor a limited number of brothels. Prostitutes in such establishments are required to undergo periodic health checks and must carry a health card.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eap/119056.htm|title=2008 Human Rights Report: Singapore|publisher=U.S. Department of State|date=25 February 2009|accessdate=25 February 2016}}</ref>

==History==
The rapid economic development of Singapore in the late nineteenth century combined with the city's gender imbalance (the male population greatly outnumbered the female){{sfn|Warren|1993|page=34}} resulted in prostitution becoming a flourishing business and brothels a boom industry.{{sfn|Warren|1993|page=32}} The prostitutes were primarily Chinese and Japanese, imported as [[karayuki-san]].{{sfn|Warren|1993|page=34}} It is estimated that 80% of the women and girls coming from China to Singapore in the late 1870s were sold into prostitution.<ref name=Abshire>{{cite book|title=The History of Singapore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AHF59oExO80C|first=Jean|last=Abshire|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2011|series=The Greenwood Histories of the Modern Nations|isbn=9780313377433|page=70}}</ref> The development of the Japanese enclave in Singapore at [[Middle Road, Singapore#Karayuki-san|Middle Road, Singapore]] was connected to the establishment of brothels east of the [[Singapore River]], namely along Hylam, Malabar, Malay and Bugis Streets during the late 1890s.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Biblioasia|volume=2|issue=2|date=July 2006|last=Lai|first=Chee Kien|title=Multi-ethnic Enclaves around Middle Road: An Examination of Early Urban Settlement in Singapore|issn=0219-8126|pages=8–9}}</ref> By 1905 there were at least 109 Japanese brothels in Singapore.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ah Ku and Karayuki-san: Prostitution in Singapore, 1870-1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eo_Hav3qHYEC|first=James Francis|last=Warren|publisher=NUS Press|year=2003|isbn= 9789971692674|page=61}}</ref>

Prostitution was seen by the colonial authorities as a necessary evil{{sfn|Warren|1993|page=34}} but a number of steps were taken to place restrictions on prostitution in the city. The registration of prostitutes and brothels was made compulsory in an attempt to prevent [[forced prostitution]], and an Office to Protect Virtue was set up to help anyone unwillingly involved in prostitution.<ref name=Abshire/> Shortly after the outbreak of [[World War I]] the colonial authorities banned prostitution by white women, and as a result the white brothels in Singapore (over twenty in 1914) had all closed by 1916.<ref name=H&S/>

A 1916 report described the misery and indecency of the prostitutes working in the [[red-light district]]s around Malay Street and Smith Street, and pressure was placed on the [[Colonial Office]] in Britain to further restrict licensed prostitution. [[Arthur Young (colonial administrator)|Sir Arthur Young]], governor-general of the [[Straits Settlements]], considered prostitution indispensable for the colony's economy and labour supply<ref name=H&S>{{cite book|title=Japan and Singapore in the World Economy: Japan's Economic Advance into Singapore 1870-1965|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gaSWBQAAQBAJ|first1=Hitoshi|last1=Hirakawa|first2=Hiroshi|last2=Shimizu|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=9781134651733|series=Routledge Studies in the Modern History of Asia}}</ref> but the sale of women and girls into prostitution was banned in 1917.<ref name=Abshire/> Influential figures in the city's Japanese community who were concerned about dignity and morality put pressure on the Japanese Consulate to end Japanese prostitution. In 1920 the Consulate ordered the banishment of all Japanese prostitutes from Singapore, though some of the women remained as unlicensed prostitutes.<ref name=H&S/> The importation of women and girls for prostitution was banned in 1927 and brothels were banned in 1930, though prostitution remained legal.<ref name=Abshire/>

During the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]] (1942–45), brothels were set up for the use of Japanese servicemen. There were about twenty such brothels in the city, typically housed in deserted Chinese mansions.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Comfort Women: Japan's Brutal Regime of Enforced Prostitution in the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87bpAgAAQBAJ|first=George|last=Hicks|publisher=W.

In the 1950s [[striptease]] acts took place at the city's [[getai]] shows, performed by specialist travelling dance troupes. The shows developed a sleazy image, partly as a result of stories about performers working as prostitutes. During this decade the city's police organised operations to reduce prostitution and Chief Minister [[Lim Yew Hock]] sought out suggestions as to how prostitution could be limited. Women's rights activist [[Shirin Fozdar]] described Singapore as \"one big brothel\"<ref>{{cite thesis|title=The 1950s Striptease Debates in Singapore: Getai and the Politics of Culture|url=https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/bitstream/10635/49345/1/HoHL%20MA%20thesis.pdf|author=Ho Hui Lin|publisher=National University of Singapore|year=2013–14}}</ref> and the city was a regional centre for prostitution. The [[People's Action Party]] under the leadership by [[Lee Kuan Yew]] initially banned prostitution when they came to power in the late 1950s, switching to a strategy of containment in the mid 1960s.<ref name=Ling-Jomo>{{cite book|title=Labour Market Segmentation in Malaysian Services|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LR8uCAAAQBAJ|first1=Khong How|last1=Ling|first2=K.S.|last2=Jomo|publisher=NUS Press|year=2009|isbn=9789971694876|series=Book collections on Project MUSE|page=35}}</ref>

From the 1950s to the early 1980s [[Bugis Street]] was famous for its nightly adult-themed shows performed by transvestites and groups of prostitutes would also openly solicit there.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Original Bugis Street|url=http://www.ghettosingapore.com/the-original-bugis-street/|author=Johnny Chen|date=26 June 2014|website=Ghetto Singapore}}</ref> Neighbouring Johore Road was also part of the red-light district in the 1960s and the 1970s, with transgender prostitutes soliciting for business in the [[shophouse]]s and alleys. Suppression of prostitution in the area began in the 1970s, and the trade was dispersed to the surrounding areas such as [[Jalan Besar]]. The old Bugis Street was demolished in the mid-1980s and Johore Road disappeared in the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why do Desker Road & Rowell Road have brothels with transgender prostitutes?|url=https://mothership.sg/2017/12/desker-rowell-road-prostitutes-singapore/|work=Mothership|location=Singapore|author=Belmont Lay|date=14 December 2017}}</ref>

==Prostitution and Law Enforcement in Practice==

Prostitution occupies an ambivalent position in Singaporean society. Major constraints control its practice despite it being legal.<ref name=Ling-Jomo/> Police unofficially tolerate and monitor a limited number of brothels, where the prostitutes are regularly screened for health check-ups; however prostitution outside these brothels also exists such as via social escort agencies that usually adopt an internet website or [[Facebook]] presence. Prostitution outside the informally designated red-light areas operates via three main channels: internet advertising, street solicitation, and [[karaoke box]] and [[massage parlor]] work. The internet-advertised sex workers are based in anonymous hotels, and the profile of each sex worker is available from the internet advertisement. Interested [[Client (prostitution)|clients]] contact the sex worker's agent through [[SMS]], who arranges the timing and gives the hotel address to the client. Sex workers operating via such illegal pimps come primarily from [[Thailand]], [[China]] and [[Philippines]] to Singapore for a short tourist visit, and therefore are not screened for health check-ups. There are also local Singaporean masseurs, therapists, [[call girl]]s or social escorts in the industry working as sex workers on the pretext of being students at a local educational institution such as a [[Institute of technology|polytechnic]], models, working office professionals or ex-[[air stewardess]]es. Some of these say that they are certified therapists. Apart from the usual bilingual [[Chinese Singaporeans|Singaporean Chinese]] that speak [[English language|English]] as well as a mother tongue such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], other ethnic races on the island such as [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indian people|Indian]] women also work as social escorts often using an [[English name]], alongside Eurasians and Russians. Vietnamese prostitutes in Singapore charge high prices for their services.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=9 August 2014 |title=More bang for your buck: How new technology is shaking up the oldest business |url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21611074-how-new-technology-shaking-up-oldest-business-more-bang-your-buck |newspaper=The Economist |location= |access-date= }}</ref>

There are grey areas such as social escorts which do not infringe on the women's charter in Singapore's law.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Apart from these regulated brothels, commercial sex workers can be found in many \"massage\" or \"spa\" establishments. Some [[Massage parlor|massage parlours]], including ''[[tui na]]'' outlets, employ women from mainland China and offer massages as a pretext for 'special' sexual services.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Koh|first1=Hui Theng|title=He wanted massage, but was offered 'special'|url=http://news.asiaone.com/print/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20120416-340126.html|accessdate=24 February 2016|publisher=The New Paper|date=18 Apr 2012}}</ref> These activities are illegal, and the operators of such massage establishments risk jail if exposed by anti-vice [[police raid]]s. Yet, virtually everyone who visits these establishments in particular is fully aware of the sexual services provided within, and are there precisely because of it. The main [[red-light district]] in Singapore is located in [[Geylang]]. [[Orchard Towers]], nicknamed the \"Four Floors of Whores\", is a shopping centre frequented by prostitutes. Some bars in [[Duxton Hill]] also offer sexual services, the most controversial ones being located at Adelphi basement which also houses a handful of law firms in the same building<ref>{{cite web|title=ENGELIN TEH PRACTICE LLC|url=http://www.etplaw.com|accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Contact Us|url=https://www.genesislawcorp.com/|website=Genesis Law Corporation|publisher=Genesis Law Corporation|accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref> as well as within walking distance from the [[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Ministry of Law]] in Singapore.

===Vice busting===
As the year 2015 came to an end, there had been an increase of around 40% of commercial crimes including prostitution or sex-related scams involving the [[internet]]; the public has been advised by the [[National Crime Prevention Council (Singapore)]] to be wary of controversial practices such as sugar mommies,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cheong|first1=Danson|title=Online \"sugar mummy\" scams on the rise: police|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/online-sugar-mummy-scams-on-the-rise-police|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=23 Feb 2016}}</ref> credit-for-sex or internet love scams.<ref>{{cite web|title=Don't be a victim Know the scams|url=http://scamalert.sg/|website=Scam Alert Singapore|publisher=National Crime Prevention Council|accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref> With sensual massage palours and other sex-related vice activities also appearing in suburban heartlands such as [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]], [[Sembawang]], [[Sengkang]], [[Jurong West]], [[Yishun]], [[Chinatown]] and [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=Foo|first1=Jie Ying|title=One-woman anti-vice squad|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/one-woman-anti-vice-squad?page=0%2C1|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=7 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Cheong|first1=Danson|title=34 women, 2 men arrested in 2-day anti-vice sweep|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/34-women-2-men-arrested-2-day-anti-vice-sweep|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=10 July 2015}}</ref> the [[Government of Singapore]] is looking at various options of regulating and punishing violations such as cases of unlicensed prostitutions or operators of brothels.

In 2016, examples of sentencing include Chew Tiong Wei who was jailed 85 months and fined S$130,000 for running an online vice ring<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hussain|first1=Amir|title=Online vice ring pimp who received nearly $2.6m in revenue over 5 years jailed|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/online-vice-ring-pimp-who-received-nearly-26million-in-revenue-over-5-years|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=11 Feb 2016}}</ref> and evading S$26,964.65 in income tax.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hussain|first1=Amir|title=Online pimp jailed and fined for evading more than $26,000 in income tax|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/online-pimp-jailed-and-fined-for-evading-more-than-26000-in-income-tax|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=12 Feb 2016}}</ref>

There are also reported cases of nightly vice activities involving transvestite prostitutes soliciting at a car park in the old [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]] Town Garden which is adjacent to the [[Johor-Singapore Causeway]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cheong|first1=Danson|title=MP pledges to clean up sleazy Woodlands park|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/mp-pledges-clean-sleazy-woodlands-park|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=11 October 2015}}</ref> These are possibly Malaysian transvestites working full-time jobs in Singapore, moonlighting to save money for sex-change operations.<ref>{{cite news|title='Sisters' peddle sex in cars at park|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sisters-peddle-sex-in-cars-at-park|accessdate=24 February 2016|publisher=Straits Times|date=11 Oct 2015}}</ref> Member of Parliament [[Halimah Yacob]] announced in 2016 a series of changes involving [[National Parks Board]] to clean up the sleaze in the area that involves upgrading the pre-existing park and malls there.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cheong|first1=Danson|title=MP pledges to clean up sleazy Woodlands park|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mp-pledges-to-clean-up-sleazy-woodlands-park|website=The Straits Times|accessdate=31 March 2018|language=en|date=11 October 2015}}</ref>

There are also rare cases of policemen impersonation on the pretext of robbing sex workers. These are offences punishable by the law in Singapore, as in the case of Teo Zhi Jie, Melvin Tan Shen Kang, Andrew Tan Zhi Wei and Lee Qing Yew. Teo Zhi Jie has since been sentenced to two years and seven months in jail and 12 strokes of the cane.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chong|first1=Elena|title=Man robbed, tied up 2 Chinese masseuses|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/asia/man-robbed-tied-2-chinese-masseuses|date=24 February 2016|work=Asia One}}</ref>

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Sex trafficking in Singapore}}
Singapore is a destination country for women and girls from other Asian countries subjected to [[sex trafficking]] and a source country for Singaporean women and children subjected to sex trafficking, mainly from perpetrators based outside of Singapore. Some of the 965,000 foreign work permit holders that comprise more than one-quarter of Singapore's total labor force are vulnerable to trafficking; most victims migrate willingly. Foreign women sometimes arrive in Singapore with the intention of engaging in prostitution, but under the threat of serious harm or other forms of coercion, they become victims of sex trafficking.<ref name=\"state18\">{{cite web |title=Singapore 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282743.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730234804/https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282743.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 July 2018 |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=30 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>

==History==
The rapid economic development of Singapore in the late nineteenth century combined with the city's gender imbalance (the male population greatly outnumbered the female){{sfn|Warren|1993|page=34}} resulted in prostitution becoming a flourishing business and brothels a boom industry.{{sfn|Warren|1993|page=32}} The prostitutes were primarily Chinese and Japanese, imported as [[karayuki-san]].{{sfn|Warren|1993|page=34}} It is estimated that 80% of the women and girls coming from China to Singapore in the late 1870s were sold into prostitution.<ref name=Abshire>{{cite book|title=The History of Singapore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AHF59oExO80C|first=Jean|last=Abshire|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2011|series=The Greenwood Histories of the Modern Nations|isbn=9780313377433|page=70}}</ref> The development of the Japanese enclave in Singapore at [[Middle Road, Singapore#Karayuki-san|Middle Road, Singapore]] was connected to the establishment of brothels east of the [[Singapore River]], namely along Hylam, Malabar, Malay and Bugis Streets during the late 1890s.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Biblioasia|volume=2|issue=2|date=July 2006|last=Lai|first=Chee Kien|title=Multi-ethnic Enclaves around Middle Road: An Examination of Early Urban Settlement in Singapore|issn=0219-8126|pages=8–9}}</ref> By 1905 there were at least 109 Japanese brothels in Singapore.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ah Ku and Karayuki-san: Prostitution in Singapore, 1870-1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eo_Hav3qHYEC|first=James Francis|last=Warren|publisher=NUS Press|year=2003|isbn= 9789971692674|page=61}}</ref>

Prostitution was seen by the colonial authorities as a necessary evil{{sfn|Warren|1993|page=34}} but a number of steps were taken to place restrictions on prostitution in the city. The registration of prostitutes and brothels was made compulsory in an attempt to prevent [[forced prostitution]], and an Office to Protect Virtue was set up to help anyone unwillingly involved in prostitution.<ref name=Abshire/> Shortly after the outbreak of [[World War I]] the colonial authorities banned prostitution by white women, and as a result the white brothels in Singapore (over twenty in 1914) had all closed by 1916.<ref name=H&S/>

A 1916 report described the misery and indecency of the prostitutes working in the [[red-light district]]s around Malay Street and Smith Street, and pressure was placed on the [[Colonial Office]] in Britain to further restrict licensed prostitution. [[Arthur Young (colonial administrator)|Sir Arthur Young]], governor-general of the [[Straits Settlements]], considered prostitution indispensable for the colony's economy and labour supply<ref name=H&S>{{cite book|title=Japan and Singapore in the World Economy: Japan's Economic Advance into Singapore 1870-1965|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gaSWBQAAQBAJ|first1=Hitoshi|last1=Hirakawa|first2=Hiroshi|last2=Shimizu|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=9781134651733|series=Routledge Studies in the Modern History of Asia}}</ref> but the sale of women and girls into prostitution was banned in 1917.<ref name=Abshire/> Influential figures in the city's Japanese community who were concerned about dignity and morality put pressure on the Japanese Consulate to end Japanese prostitution. In 1920 the Consulate ordered the banishment of all Japanese prostitutes from Singapore, though some of the women remained as unlicensed prostitutes.<ref name=H&S/> The importation of women and girls for prostitution was banned in 1927 and brothels were banned in 1930, though prostitution remained legal.<ref name=Abshire/>

During the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]] (1942–45), brothels were set up for the use of Japanese servicemen. There were about twenty such brothels in the city, typically housed in deserted Chinese mansions.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Comfort Women: Japan's Brutal Regime of Enforced Prostitution in the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87bpAgAAQBAJ|first=George|last=Hicks|publisher=W.

In the 1950s [[striptease]] acts took place at the city's [[getai]] shows, performed by specialist travelling dance troupes. The shows developed a sleazy image, partly as a result of stories about performers working as prostitutes. During this decade the city's police organised operations to reduce prostitution and Chief Minister [[Lim Yew Hock]] sought out suggestions as to how prostitution could be limited. Women's rights activist [[Shirin Fozdar]] described Singapore as \"one big brothel\"<ref>{{cite thesis|title=The 1950s Striptease Debates in Singapore: Getai and the Politics of Culture|url=https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/bitstream/10635/49345/1/HoHL%20MA%20thesis.pdf|author=Ho Hui Lin|publisher=National University of Singapore|year=2013–14}}</ref> and the city was a regional centre for prostitution. The [[People's Action Party]] under the leadership by [[Lee Kuan Yew]] initially banned prostitution when they came to power in the late 1950s, switching to a strategy of containment in the mid 1960s.<ref name=Ling-Jomo>{{cite book|title=Labour Market Segmentation in Malaysian Services|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LR8uCAAAQBAJ|first1=Khong How|last1=Ling|first2=K.S.|last2=Jomo|publisher=NUS Press|year=2009|isbn=9789971694876|series=Book collections on Project MUSE|page=35}}</ref>

From the 1950s to the early 1980s [[Bugis Street]] was famous for its nightly adult-themed shows performed by transvestites and groups of prostitutes would also openly solicit there.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Original Bugis Street|url=http://www.ghettosingapore.com/the-original-bugis-street/|author=Johnny Chen|date=26 June 2014|website=Ghetto Singapore}}</ref> Neighbouring Johore Road was also part of the red-light district in the 1960s and the 1970s, with transgender prostitutes soliciting for business in the [[shophouse]]s and alleys. Suppression of prostitution in the area began in the 1970s, and the trade was dispersed to the surrounding areas such as [[Jalan Besar]]. The old Bugis Street was demolished in the mid-1980s and Johore Road disappeared in the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why do Desker Road & Rowell Road have brothels with transgender prostitutes?|url=https://mothership.sg/2017/12/desker-rowell-road-prostitutes-singapore/|work=Mothership|location=Singapore|author=Belmont Lay|date=14 December 2017}}</ref>

==Prostitution and Law Enforcement in Practice==

Prostitution occupies an ambivalent position in Singaporean society. Major constraints control its practice despite it being legal.<ref name=Ling-Jomo/> Police unofficially tolerate and monitor a limited number of brothels, where the prostitutes are regularly screened for health check-ups; however prostitution outside these brothels also exists such as via social escort agencies that usually adopt an internet website or [[Facebook]] presence. Prostitution outside the informally designated red-light areas operates via three main channels: internet advertising, street solicitation, and [[karaoke box]] and [[massage parlor]] work. The internet-advertised sex workers are based in anonymous hotels, and the profile of each sex worker is available from the internet advertisement. Interested [[Client (prostitution)|clients]] contact the sex worker's agent through [[SMS]], who arranges the timing and gives the hotel address to the client. Sex workers operating via such illegal pimps come primarily from [[Thailand]], [[China]] and [[Philippines]] to Singapore for a short tourist visit, and therefore are not screened for health check-ups. There are also local Singaporean masseurs, therapists, [[call girl]]s or social escorts in the industry working as sex workers on the pretext of being students at a local educational institution such as a [[Institute of technology|polytechnic]], models, working office professionals or ex-[[air stewardess]]es. Some of these say that they are certified therapists. Apart from the usual bilingual [[Chinese Singaporeans|Singaporean Chinese]] that speak [[English language|English]] as well as a mother tongue such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], other ethnic races on the island such as [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indian people|Indian]] women also work as social escorts often using an [[English name]], alongside Eurasians and Russians. Vietnamese prostitutes in Singapore charge high prices for their services.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=9 August 2014 |title=More bang for your buck: How new technology is shaking up the oldest business |url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21611074-how-new-technology-shaking-up-oldest-business-more-bang-your-buck |newspaper=The Economist |location= |access-date= }}</ref>

There are grey areas such as social escorts which do not infringe on the women's charter in Singapore's law.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Apart from these regulated brothels, commercial sex workers can be found in many \"massage\" or \"spa\" establishments. Some [[Massage parlor|massage parlours]], including ''[[tui na]]'' outlets, employ women from mainland China and offer massages as a pretext for 'special' sexual services.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Koh|first1=Hui Theng|title=He wanted massage, but was offered 'special'|url=http://news.asiaone.com/print/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20120416-340126.html|accessdate=24 February 2016|publisher=The New Paper|date=18 Apr 2012}}</ref> These activities are illegal, and the operators of such massage establishments risk jail if exposed by anti-vice [[police raid]]s. Yet, virtually everyone who visits these establishments in particular is fully aware of the sexual services provided within, and are there precisely because of it. The main [[red-light district]] in Singapore is located in [[Geylang]]. [[Orchard Towers]], nicknamed the \"Four Floors of Whores\", is a shopping centre frequented by prostitutes. Some bars in [[Duxton Hill]] also offer sexual services, the most controversial ones being located at Adelphi basement which also houses a handful of law firms in the same building<ref>{{cite web|title=ENGELIN TEH PRACTICE LLC|url=http://www.etplaw.com|accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Contact Us|url=https://www.genesislawcorp.com/|website=Genesis Law Corporation|publisher=Genesis Law Corporation|accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref> as well as within walking distance from the [[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Ministry of Law]] in Singapore.

===Vice busting===
As the year 2015 came to an end, there had been an increase of around 40% of commercial crimes including prostitution or sex-related scams involving the [[internet]]; the public has been advised by the [[National Crime Prevention Council (Singapore)]] to be wary of controversial practices such as sugar mommies,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cheong|first1=Danson|title=Online \"sugar mummy\" scams on the rise: police|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/online-sugar-mummy-scams-on-the-rise-police|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=23 Feb 2016}}</ref> credit-for-sex or internet love scams.<ref>{{cite web|title=Don't be a victim Know the scams|url=http://scamalert.sg/|website=Scam Alert Singapore|publisher=National Crime Prevention Council|accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref> With sensual massage palours and other sex-related vice activities also appearing in suburban heartlands such as [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]], [[Sembawang]], [[Sengkang]], [[Jurong West]], [[Yishun]], [[Chinatown]] and [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=Foo|first1=Jie Ying|title=One-woman anti-vice squad|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/one-woman-anti-vice-squad?page=0%2C1|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=7 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Cheong|first1=Danson|title=34 women, 2 men arrested in 2-day anti-vice sweep|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/34-women-2-men-arrested-2-day-anti-vice-sweep|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=10 July 2015}}</ref> the [[Government of Singapore]] is looking at various options of regulating and punishing violations such as cases of unlicensed prostitutions or operators of brothels.

In 2016, examples of sentencing include Chew Tiong Wei who was jailed 85 months and fined S$130,000 for running an online vice ring<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hussain|first1=Amir|title=Online vice ring pimp who received nearly $2.6m in revenue over 5 years jailed|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/online-vice-ring-pimp-who-received-nearly-26million-in-revenue-over-5-years|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=11 Feb 2016}}</ref> and evading S$26,964.65 in income tax.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hussain|first1=Amir|title=Online pimp jailed and fined for evading more than $26,000 in income tax|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/online-pimp-jailed-and-fined-for-evading-more-than-26000-in-income-tax|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=12 Feb 2016}}</ref>

There are also reported cases of nightly vice activities involving transvestite prostitutes soliciting at a car park in the old [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]] Town Garden which is adjacent to the [[Johor-Singapore Causeway]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cheong|first1=Danson|title=MP pledges to clean up sleazy Woodlands park|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/mp-pledges-clean-sleazy-woodlands-park|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=11 October 2015}}</ref> These are possibly Malaysian transvestites working full-time jobs in Singapore, moonlighting to save money for sex-change operations.<ref>{{cite news|title='Sisters' peddle sex in cars at park|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sisters-peddle-sex-in-cars-at-park|accessdate=24 February 2016|publisher=Straits Times|date=11 Oct 2015}}</ref> Member of Parliament [[Halimah Yacob]] announced in 2016 a series of changes involving [[National Parks Board]] to clean up the sleaze in the area that involves upgrading the pre-existing park and malls there.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cheong|first1=Danson|title=MP pledges to clean up sleazy Woodlands park|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mp-pledges-to-clean-up-sleazy-woodlands-park|website=The Straits Times|accessdate=31 March 2018|language=en|date=11 October 2015}}</ref>

There are also rare cases of policemen impersonation on the pretext of robbing sex workers. These are offences punishable by the law in Singapore, as in the case of Teo Zhi Jie, Melvin Tan Shen Kang, Andrew Tan Zhi Wei and Lee Qing Yew. Teo Zhi Jie has since been sentenced to two years and seven months in jail and 12 strokes of the cane.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chong|first1=Elena|title=Man robbed, tied up 2 Chinese masseuses|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/asia/man-robbed-tied-2-chinese-masseuses|date=24 February 2016|work=Asia One}}</ref>

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Sex trafficking in Singapore}}
Singapore is a destination country for women and girls from other Asian countries subjected to [[sex trafficking]] and a source country for Singaporean women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Some of the 965,000 foreign work permit holders that comprise more than one-quarter of Singapore's total labor force are vulnerable to trafficking; most victims migrate willingly. Traffickers compel victims into sex exploitation through illegal withholding of their pay, threats of forced repatriation without pay, restrictions on movement, and physical and sexual abuse. Foreign women sometimes arrive in Singapore with the intention of engaging in prostitution, but under the threat of serious harm or other forms of coercion, they become victims of sex trafficking.<ref name=\"state18\">{{cite web |title=Singapore 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282743.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730234804/https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282743.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 July 2018 |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=30 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>

In July 2018, the office of the Los Angeles District Attorney announced that Westwick would not be prosecuted regarding the claims of rape and sexual assault. Prosecutors said witnesses identified by the first two alleged victims were \"not able to provide information that would enable the prosecution to prove either incident beyond a reasonable doubt\", with prosecutors unable to contact the third claimant. Prosecutors also noted additional claims made by other individuals would not be looked into due to being outside the statute of limitations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44985583|title=Ed Westwick will not be prosecuted in US|date=27 July 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News}}</ref>

The allegations resulted in the re-shooting of scenes involving Westwick in the BBC adaptation of the [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[Ordeal by Innocence (miniseries)|Ordeal By Innocence]]'' with [[Christian Cooke]], and series two of ''[[White Gold (TV series)|White Gold]]'' being \"paused\".

In July 2018, the office of the Los Angeles District Attorney announced that Westwick would not be prosecuted regarding the claims of rape and sexual assault. Prosecutors said witnesses identified by the first two alleged victims were \"not able to provide information that would enable the prosecution to prove either incident beyond a reasonable doubt\", with prosecutors unable to contact the third claimant. Prosecutors also noted additional claims made by other individuals would not be looked into due to being outside the statute of limitations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44985583|title=Ed Westwick will not be prosecuted in US|date=27 July 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News}}</ref>

The allegations resulted in the re-shooting of scenes involving Westwick in the BBC adaptation of the [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[Ordeal by Innocence (miniseries)|Ordeal By Innocence]]'' with [[Christian Cooke]], and series two of ''[[White Gold (TV series)|White Gold]]'' being \"paused\".

A '''church building''' or '''church house''', often simply called a '''church''', is a building used for [[Christianity|Christian]] religious activities, particularly for [[Christian worship]] services. The term is often used by [[Christians]] to refer to the physical buildings where they worship, but it is sometimes used as an analogy to refer to buildings of other [[religion]]s.<ref>Use of the term [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/362167/Manichaeism \"The Manichaean Church\"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''</ref> In traditional [[Christian architecture]], a church interior is often structured in the shape of a [[Christian cross]]. When viewed from [[plan view]] the vertical beam of the cross is represented by the center [[aisle]] and seating while the horizontal beam and junction of the cross is formed by the [[Church_architecture#Characteristics_of_the_early_Christian_church_building|bema]] and [[altar]].

Towers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the [[heaven]]s and inspiring a range of thoughts and emotions in visitors and worshippers. Modern church buildings have a variety of [[architectural style]]s and layouts; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use, and, conversely, many original church buildings have been put to other uses.

The earliest identified Christian church building was a [[house church]] founded between 233 and 256. From the 11th through the 14th centuries, a wave of building of [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|cathedrals]] and smaller [[parish church]]es were erected across [[Western Europe]]. A [[cathedral]] is a church building, usually [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Protestant]] (including [[Anglican]]), [[Eastern Orthodox]], or [[Oriental Orthodox]], housing a [[cathedra]], the formal name for the [[episcopal see|seat]] or [[throne]] of a presiding [[bishop]].

==Etymology==
In [[Greek language|Greek]], the adjective ''kyriak-ós/-ē/-ón'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:κυριακόν|κυριακόν]]}}) means \"belonging, or pertaining, to a ''[[Kyrios]]''\" (\"Lord\"), and the usage was adopted by [[early Christians]] of the Eastern Mediterranean with regard to anything pertaining to the Lord [[Jesus Christ]]: hence \"''Kyriakós oíkos''\" ({{lang|grc|Kυριακός οίκος}}) (\"house of the Lord\", church), \"''Kyriakē''\" ({{lang|grc|Κυριακή}}) (\"[the day] of the Lord\", i.e. [[Sunday]]), or \"''Kyriakē proseukhē''\" ({{lang-el|Κυριακή προσευχή}}) (the \"[[Lord's Prayer]]\").<ref name=\"OEtymDChurch\">{{Cite web |title=Church |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=church |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=8 August 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - cyrican.jpg|thumb|''Cyrican'' is an Old English word for churches and church property]]
In standard Greek usage, the older word \"ecclesia\" ({{lang-el|ἐκκλησία}}, ''ekklesía'', literally \"assembly\", \"congregation\", or the place where such a gathering occurs) was retained to signify both a specific edifice of Christian worship (a \"[[wikt:church|'''c'''hurch\"]]), and the overall community of the faithful ([[wikt:Church|the \"'''C'''hurch\"]]). This usage was also retained in [[Latin]] and the languages derived from Latin (e.g. French ''église'', Italian ''chiesa'', Spanish ''iglesia'', Portuguese ''igreja'', etc.), as well as in the [[Celtic languages]] (Welsh ''eglwys'', Irish ''eaglais'', Breton ''iliz'', etc.) and in Turkish (''kilise'').<ref name=\"OEtymDChurch\" />

In the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and some [[Slavic languages]], the word ''kyriak-ós/-ē/-ón'' was adopted instead and derivatives formed thereof. In [[Old English]] the sequence of derivation started as \"cirice\", then [[Middle English]] \"churche\", and eventually \"church\" in its current pronunciation. German ''Kirche'', Scots ''kirk'', Russian {{lang|ru|церковь}} (''tserkov''), etc., are all similarly derived.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aggressivechristianity.net/articles/ecclesia.htm|title=THE CORRECT MEANING OF \"CHURCH\" AND \"ECCLESIA\"|website=www.aggressivechristianity.net|access-date=2016-06-22}}</ref>

==History==
ISLAM IS A FAKE RELIGION
===Antiquity===
According to the [[New Testament]], the earliest Christians did not build church buildings. Instead, they gathered in homes ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017:5 Acts 17:5], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+20%3A20&version=NIV 20:20], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+16%3A19&version=NIV 1 Corinthians 16:19]) or in Jewish worship places like the [[Second Temple]] or [[synagogue]]s ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+2%3A46&version=NIV Acts 2:46], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+19%3A8&version=NIV 19:8]). The earliest archeologically identified Christian church is a [[house church]] (''domus ecclesiae''), the [[Dura-Europos church]], founded between 233 and 256.<ref>{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=Graydon F. |title=Ante Pacem: Archaeological Evidence of Church Life Before Constantine |publisher=Mercer University Press |year=2003 |pp=128}}</ref> In the second half of the 3rd century AD, the first purpose-built halls for Christian worshipISLAM IS A FAKE RELIGION (''aula ecclesiae'') began to be constructed. Although many of these were destroyed early in the next century duringISLAM IS A FAKE RELIGION the [[Diocletianic Persecution]], even larger and more elaborate church buildings began to appear during the reign of the Emperor [[Constantine the Great]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hartog |editor1-first=Paul |date= |title=The Contemporary Church and the Early Church: Case Studies in Ressourcement |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hlqUCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT70&dq=early+church+buildings&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwipkrWVip3VAhUMD8AKHdfuD5AQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&q=early%20church%20buildings&f=false |location= |publisher=Pickwick Publications |page= |isbn= 978-1606088999 }} (Chapter 3)</ref>

===Medieval times===
[[File:Frauenkirche München abends.jpg|thumb|The [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] in [[Munich]] is a largely [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], medieval church.]]
From the 11th through the 14th centuries, a wave of [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|cathedral-building]] and construction of smaller parish churches occurred across [[Western Europe]]. Besides serving as a place of worship, the cathedral or parish church was frequently employed as a general gathering-place by the communities in which they were located, hosting such events as [[guild]] meetings,ISLAM IS A FAKE RELIGION [[banquet]]s, [[mystery plays]], and [[fair]]s. Church grounds and buildings were also used for the threshing and storage of grain.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levy |title=Cathedrals and the Church |page=12}}</ref>

==== Romanesque architecture ====
Between 1000 and 1200 the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] style became popular across [[Europe]]. While the term ''\"Romanesque\"'' refers to the tradition of [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman architecture]], the trend in fact appeared throughout Western and Central Europe. The romanesque style is defined by large and bulky edifices that are typically made up of simple, compact, sparsely decorated geometric structures. Frequent features of the Romanesque church include [[Arch|circular arches]], round or [[octagon]]al towers and [[Capital (architecture)|cushion capitals]] on pillars. In the early romanesque era, [[coffer]]ing on the ceiling was fashionable, while later in the same era, [[Groin vault|groined vault]] gained popularity. Interiors widened and the motifs of [[sculpture]]s took on more epic traits and themes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=g3HgsgEACAAJ&dq=romanesque+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjN5bDd2-PVAhVIrRQKHfNkBHUQ6AEIPjAD|title=Romanesque: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting|last=Toman|first=Rolf|date=2015-04-30|publisher=h.f.ullmann|isbn=9783848008407|language=en}}</ref>

==== Gothic architecture ====
[[File:Santuario de Las Lajas, Ipiales, Colombia, 2015-07-21, DD 21-23 HDR.jpg|thumb|[[Las Lajas Sanctuary]] in southern Colombia.]]
ISLAM IS A FAKE RELIGION
The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style emerged around 1140 in [[Île-de-France]] and subsequently spread throughout Europe. Gothic churches lost the compact qualities of the romanesque era and decorations often contained [[symbol]]ic and [[Allegory|allegorical]] features. The first [[pointed arch]]es, [[rib vault]]s and [[buttress]]es began to appear, all possessing geometric properties that reduced the need for large, rigid walls to ensure structural stability. This also permitted the size of windows to increase, producing brighter and lighter interiors. [[Nave]] ceilings became higher and pillars and steeples grew taller. Many architects used these developments to push the limits of structural possibility, an inclination which resulted in the collapse of several towers possessing designs that had unwittingly exceeded the boundaries of soundness. In [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Spain]], it became popular to build [[hall church]]es, a style in which every [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] would be built to the same height.

Gothic cathedrals were lavishly designed, as in the romanesque era, and many share romanesque traits. However, several also exhibit unprecedented degrees of detail and complexity in decoration. The [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and [[Reims Cathedral|Notre-Dame de Reims]] in France, as well as the [[San Francesco d'Assisi, Palermo|San Francesco d’Assisi]] in [[Palermo]], and the [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[Wool church|Wool Church]] in [[England]] demonstrate the elaborate stylings characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.

Some of the most well-known gothic churches remained unfinished for centuries, after the gothic style fell out of popularity. The construction of the  [[Cologne Cathedral]], which was begun in 1248, halted in 1473, and not resumed until 1842 is one such example.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=LBZ6781vvOwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=gothic+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiskNCu2-PVAhWF6RQKHXAFA_EQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Gothic Architecture|last=Frankl|first=Paul|last2=Crossley|first2=Paul|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300087993|language=en}}</ref>
ISLAM IS A FAKE RELIGION
=== Renaissance ===
In the 15th and 16th century, the change in ethics and society due to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Reformation]] also influenced the building of churches. The common style was much like the gothic style, but in a simplified way. The [[basilica]] was not the most popular type of church anymore, but instead [[hall church]]es were built. Typical features are columns and classical [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=70m1KbuD5YoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=renaissance+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWwu-Bo-TVAhUDORQKHfd9B3YQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=renaissance%20architecture&f=false|title=Renaissance Architecture|last=Anderson|first=Christy|date=2013-02-28|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780192842275|language=en}}</ref>

In [[Protestantism|Protestant churches]], where the proclamation of God's Word is of special importance, the visitor's line of view is directed towards the [[pulpit]].

=== Baroque architecture ===
The [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] style was first used in [[Italy]] around 1575. From there it spread to the rest of Europe and to the European colonies. During the baroque era, the building industry increased heavily. Buildings, even churches, were used as indicators for wealth, authority and influence. The use of forms known from the [[renaissance]] were extremely exaggerated. [[Dome]]s and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] were decorated with moulding and the former [[Stucco|stucco-sculptures]] ISLAM IS A FAKE RELIGIONwere replaced by [[fresco]] paintings on the ceilings. For the first time, churches were seen as one connected work of art and consistent artistic concepts were developed. Instead of long buildings, more central-plan buildings were created. The sprawling decoration with floral ornamentation and mythological motives raised until about 1720 to the [[Rococo|rococo era]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=eaC7yKbxj8UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=baroque+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi14YH0rOTVAhXQERQKHZaZDEoQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=baroque%20architecture&f=false|title=Pietro Da Cortona and Roman Baroque Architecture|last=Merz|first=Jörg Martin|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300111231|language=en}}</ref>

The [[Protestantism|Protestant parishes]] preferred lateral churches, in which all the visitors could be as close as possible to the [[pulpit]] and the [[altar]].

[[File:Norwich Cathedral from Cloisters, Norfolk, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Norwich Cathedral]] in England is an example of a Cathedral complex built during the [[Middle Ages]].]]
A common architecture for churches is the shape of a [[Christian cross|cross]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=dqIZAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=Remarks on Church Architecture ...|last=Petit|first=John Louis|date=1841|publisher=J. Burns|language=en}}</ref> (a long central rectangle, with side rectangles, and a rectangle in front for the [[altar]] space or sanctuary). These churches also often have a [[dome]] or other large [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] space in the interior to represent or draw attention to the heavens. Other common shapes for churches include a circle, to represent eternity, or an [[octagon]] or similar star shape, to represent the church's bringing light to the world. Another common feature is the [[spire]], a tall tower on the \"west\" end of the church or over the [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]].

Another common feature of many Christian churches is the [[Orientation of churches|eastwards orientation]] of the front [[altar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacredarchitecture.org/articles/sacred_places_the_significance_of_the_church_building/|title=The Institute for Sacred Architecture {{!}} Articles {{!}} Sacred Places: The Significance of the Church Building|website=www.sacredarchitecture.org|access-date=2017-08-16}}</ref> 
Often, the altar will not be oriented due east, but in the direction of sunrise. This tradition originated in Byzantium in the 4th century, and becomes prevalent in the West in the 8th to 9th century. 
The old Roman custom of having the altar at the west end and the entrance at the east was sometimes followed as late as the 11th century even in areas of northern Europe under Frankish rule, as seen in [[Petershausen (Constance)]], [[Bamberg Cathedral]], [[Augsburg Cathedral]], [[Regensburg Cathedral]], and [[Hildesheim Cathedral]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=sX8w667tblMC&pg=PA12&dq=%22XI+Jahrh+fortgedauert%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwir9NbtjObLAhWHDg8KHUFVA8kQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22XI%20Jahrh%20fortgedauert%22&f=false Heinrich Otte, ''Handbuch der kirchlichen Kunst-Archäologie des deutschen Mittelalters'' (Leipzig 1868), p. 12]</ref>

===Basilica===
{{main article|Basilica}}
The [[Latin]] word basilica (derived from [[Greek language|Greek]], ''[[Stoa Basileios|Basiliké Stoà]]'', Royal ''[[Stoa]]'') was originally used to describe a [[ancient Rome|Roman]] public building (as in [[Greece]], mainly a [[tribunal]]), usually located in the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] of a Roman town.<ref name=\"OXFORD1\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=Te2dAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA117 ''The Oxford Dictionary of Christian Art and Architecture''] (2013 {{ISBN|978-0-19968027-6}}), p. 117</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacredarchitecture.org/articles/the_eschatological_dimension_of_church_architecture|title=The Institute for Sacred Architecture - Articles- The Eschatological Dimension of Church Architecture|publisher=}}</ref>

After the [[Roman Empire]] became [[Edict of Thessalonica|officially Christian]], the term came by extension to refer to a large and important church that has been given special ceremonial rights by the [[Pope]]. Thus the word retains two senses today, one architectural and the other ecclesiastical.[[File:St. Peter and St. Paul's Church 1, Vilnius, Lithuania - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|Central [[nave]] of [[St. Peter and St. Paul's Church, Vilnius]], Lithuania looking north-east towards the altar.

A [[cathedral]] is a church, usually [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Anglican]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] or [[Eastern Orthodox]], housing the seat of a bishop. The word cathedral takes its name from ''[[cathedra]]'', or Bishop's Throne (In {{lang-la|ecclesia cathedralis}}). The term is sometimes (improperly) used to refer to any church of great size.

A church that has the function of cathedral is not necessarily a large building. It might be as small as [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford|Christ Church Cathedral]] in [[Oxford]], England, [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh, United States]], or [[Chur]] Cathedral in [[Switzerland]]. However, frequently, the cathedral along with some of the abbey churches, was the [[List of largest buildings in the world|largest building]] in any region.

===Pilgrimage church===
{{main|Pilgrimage church}}
A pilgrimage church is a church to which [[pilgrimage]]s are regularly made, or a church along a pilgrimage route, often located at the tomb of a [[saint]]s, or holding icons or [[relic]]s to which miraculous properties are ascribed, the site of [[Marian apparition]]s, etc.

===Conventual church===
{{see|Priory|Katholikon}}
A conventual church (or monastery church, [[Minster (church)|minster]], ''[[katholikon]]'') is the main church building in a Christian [[monastery]] or [[abbey]].

===Collegiate church===
{{main|Collegiate church}}
A collegiate church is a church where the [[daily office]] of worship is maintained by a [[college (canon law)|college]] of [[canon (priest)|canons]], which may be presided over by a [[Dean (religion)|dean]] or [[Provost (religion)|provost]].
Collegiate churches were often supported by extensive lands held by the church, or by [[tithe]] income from [[impropriation|appropriated]] [[benefices]]. They commonly provide distinct spaces for congregational worship and for the choir offices of their clerical community.

A '''church building''' or '''church house''', often simply called a '''church''', is a building used for [[Christianity|Christian]] religious activities, particularly for [[Christian worship]] services. The term is often used by [[Christians]] to refer to the physical buildings where they worship, but it is sometimes used as an analogy to refer to buildings of other [[religion]]s.<ref>Use of the term [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/362167/Manichaeism \"The Manichaean Church\"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''</ref> In traditional [[Christian architecture]], a church interior is often structured in the shape of a [[Christian cross]]. When viewed from [[plan view]] the vertical beam of the cross is represented by the center [[aisle]] and seating while the horizontal beam and junction of the cross is formed by the [[Church_architecture#Characteristics_of_the_early_Christian_church_building|bema]] and [[altar]].

Towers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the [[heaven]]s and inspiring a range of thoughts and emotions in visitors and worshippers. Modern church buildings have a variety of [[architectural style]]s and layouts; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use, and, conversely, many original church buildings have been put to other uses.

The earliest identified Christian church building was a [[house church]] founded between 233 and 256. From the 11th through the 14th centuries, a wave of building of [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|cathedrals]] and smaller [[parish church]]es were erected across [[Western Europe]]. A [[cathedral]] is a church building, usually [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Protestant]] (including [[Anglican]]), [[Eastern Orthodox]], or [[Oriental Orthodox]], housing a [[cathedra]], the formal name for the [[episcopal see|seat]] or [[throne]] of a presiding [[bishop]].

==Etymology==
In [[Greek language|Greek]], the adjective ''kyriak-ós/-ē/-ón'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:κυριακόν|κυριακόν]]}}) means \"belonging, or pertaining, to a ''[[Kyrios]]''\" (\"Lord\"), and the usage was adopted by [[early Christians]] of the Eastern Mediterranean with regard to anything pertaining to the Lord [[Jesus Christ]]: hence \"''Kyriakós oíkos''\" ({{lang|grc|Kυριακός οίκος}}) (\"house of the Lord\", church), \"''Kyriakē''\" ({{lang|grc|Κυριακή}}) (\"[the day] of the Lord\", i.e. [[Sunday]]), or \"''Kyriakē proseukhē''\" ({{lang-el|Κυριακή προσευχή}}) (the \"[[Lord's Prayer]]\").<ref name=\"OEtymDChurch\">{{Cite web |title=Church |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=church |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=8 August 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - cyrican.jpg|thumb|''Cyrican'' is an Old English word for churches and church property]]
In standard Greek usage, the older word \"ecclesia\" ({{lang-el|ἐκκλησία}}, ''ekklesía'', literally \"assembly\", \"congregation\", or the place where such a gathering occurs) was retained to signify both a specific edifice of Christian worship (a \"[[wikt:church|'''c'''hurch\"]]), and the overall community of the faithful ([[wikt:Church|the \"'''C'''hurch\"]]). This usage was also retained in [[Latin]] and the languages derived from Latin (e.g. French ''église'', Italian ''chiesa'', Spanish ''iglesia'', Portuguese ''igreja'', etc.), as well as in the [[Celtic languages]] (Welsh ''eglwys'', Irish ''eaglais'', Breton ''iliz'', etc.) and in Turkish (''kilise'').<ref name=\"OEtymDChurch\" />

In the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and some [[Slavic languages]], the word ''kyriak-ós/-ē/-ón'' was adopted instead and derivatives formed thereof. In [[Old English]] the sequence of derivation started as \"cirice\", then [[Middle English]] \"churche\", and eventually \"church\" in its current pronunciation. German ''Kirche'', Scots ''kirk'', Russian {{lang|ru|церковь}} (''tserkov''), etc., are all similarly derived.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aggressivechristianity.net/articles/ecclesia.htm|title=THE CORRECT MEANING OF \"CHURCH\" AND \"ECCLESIA\"|website=www.aggressivechristianity.net|access-date=2016-06-22}}</ref>

==History==

===Antiquity===
According to the [[New Testament]], the earliest Christians did not build church buildings. Instead, they gathered in homes ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017:5 Acts 17:5], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+20%3A20&version=NIV 20:20], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+16%3A19&version=NIV 1 Corinthians 16:19]) or in Jewish worship places like the [[Second Temple]] or [[synagogue]]s ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+2%3A46&version=NIV Acts 2:46], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+19%3A8&version=NIV 19:8]). The earliest archeologically identified Christian church is a [[house church]] (''domus ecclesiae''), the [[Dura-Europos church]], founded between 233 and 256.<ref>{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=Graydon F. |title=Ante Pacem: Archaeological Evidence of Church Life Before Constantine |publisher=Mercer University Press |year=2003 |pp=128}}</ref> In the second half of the 3rd century AD, the first purpose-built halls for Christian worship (''aula ecclesiae'') began to be constructed. Although many of these were destroyed early in the next century during the [[Diocletianic Persecution]], even larger and more elaborate church buildings began to appear during the reign of the Emperor [[Constantine the Great]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hartog |editor1-first=Paul |date= |title=The Contemporary Church and the Early Church: Case Studies in Ressourcement |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hlqUCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT70&dq=early+church+buildings&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwipkrWVip3VAhUMD8AKHdfuD5AQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&q=early%20church%20buildings&f=false |location= |publisher=Pickwick Publications |page= |isbn= 978-1606088999 }} (Chapter 3)</ref>

===Medieval times===
[[File:Frauenkirche München abends.jpg|thumb|The [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] in [[Munich]] is a largely [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], medieval church.]]
From the 11th through the 14th centuries, a wave of [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|cathedral-building]] and construction of smaller parish churches occurred across [[Western Europe]]. Besides serving as a place of worship, the cathedral or parish church was frequently employed as a general gathering-place by the communities in which they were located, hosting such events as [[guild]] meetings, [[banquet]]s, [[mystery plays]], and [[fair]]s. Church grounds and buildings were also used for the threshing and storage of grain.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levy |title=Cathedrals and the Church |page=12}}</ref>

==== Romanesque architecture ====
Between 1000 and 1200 the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] style became popular across [[Europe]]. While the term ''\"Romanesque\"'' refers to the tradition of [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman architecture]], the trend in fact appeared throughout Western and Central Europe. The romanesque style is defined by large and bulky edifices that are typically made up of simple, compact, sparsely decorated geometric structures. Frequent features of the Romanesque church include [[Arch|circular arches]], round or [[octagon]]al towers and [[Capital (architecture)|cushion capitals]] on pillars. In the early romanesque era, [[coffer]]ing on the ceiling was fashionable, while later in the same era, [[Groin vault|groined vault]] gained popularity. Interiors widened and the motifs of [[sculpture]]s took on more epic traits and themes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=g3HgsgEACAAJ&dq=romanesque+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjN5bDd2-PVAhVIrRQKHfNkBHUQ6AEIPjAD|title=Romanesque: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting|last=Toman|first=Rolf|date=2015-04-30|publisher=h.f.ullmann|isbn=9783848008407|language=en}}</ref>

==== Gothic architecture ====
[[File:Santuario de Las Lajas, Ipiales, Colombia, 2015-07-21, DD 21-23 HDR.jpg|thumb|[[Las Lajas Sanctuary]] in southern Colombia.]]

The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style emerged around 1140 in [[Île-de-France]] and subsequently spread throughout Europe. Gothic churches lost the compact qualities of the romanesque era and decorations often contained [[symbol]]ic and [[Allegory|allegorical]] features. The first [[pointed arch]]es, [[rib vault]]s and [[buttress]]es began to appear, all possessing geometric properties that reduced the need for large, rigid walls to ensure structural stability. This also permitted the size of windows to increase, producing brighter and lighter interiors. [[Nave]] ceilings became higher and pillars and steeples grew taller. Many architects used these developments to push the limits of structural possibility, an inclination which resulted in the collapse of several towers possessing designs that had unwittingly exceeded the boundaries of soundness. In [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Spain]], it became popular to build [[hall church]]es, a style in which every [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] would be built to the same height.

Gothic cathedrals were lavishly designed, as in the romanesque era, and many share romanesque traits. However, several also exhibit unprecedented degrees of detail and complexity in decoration. The [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and [[Reims Cathedral|Notre-Dame de Reims]] in France, as well as the [[San Francesco d'Assisi, Palermo|San Francesco d’Assisi]] in [[Palermo]], and the [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[Wool church|Wool Church]] in [[England]] demonstrate the elaborate stylings characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.

Some of the most well-known gothic churches remained unfinished for centuries, after the gothic style fell out of popularity. The construction of the  [[Cologne Cathedral]], which was begun in 1248, halted in 1473, and not resumed until 1842 is one such example.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=LBZ6781vvOwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=gothic+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiskNCu2-PVAhWF6RQKHXAFA_EQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Gothic Architecture|last=Frankl|first=Paul|last2=Crossley|first2=Paul|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300087993|language=en}}</ref>

=== Renaissance ===
In the 15th and 16th century, the change in ethics and society due to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Reformation]] also influenced the building of churches. The common style was much like the gothic style, but in a simplified way. The [[basilica]] was not the most popular type of church anymore, but instead [[hall church]]es were built. Typical features are columns and classical [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=70m1KbuD5YoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=renaissance+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWwu-Bo-TVAhUDORQKHfd9B3YQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=renaissance%20architecture&f=false|title=Renaissance Architecture|last=Anderson|first=Christy|date=2013-02-28|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780192842275|language=en}}</ref>

In [[Protestantism|Protestant churches]], where the proclamation of God's Word is of special importance, the visitor's line of view is directed towards the [[pulpit]].

=== Baroque architecture ===
The [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] style was first used in [[Italy]] around 1575. From there it spread to the rest of Europe and to the European colonies. During the baroque era, the building industry increased heavily. Buildings, even churches, were used as indicators for wealth, authority and influence. The use of forms known from the [[renaissance]] were extremely exaggerated. [[Dome]]s and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] were decorated with moulding and the former [[Stucco|stucco-sculptures]] were replaced by [[fresco]] paintings on the ceilings. For the first time, churches were seen as one connected work of art and consistent artistic concepts were developed. Instead of long buildings, more central-plan buildings were created. The sprawling decoration with floral ornamentation and mythological motives raised until about 1720 to the [[Rococo|rococo era]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=eaC7yKbxj8UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=baroque+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi14YH0rOTVAhXQERQKHZaZDEoQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=baroque%20architecture&f=false|title=Pietro Da Cortona and Roman Baroque Architecture|last=Merz|first=Jörg Martin|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300111231|language=en}}</ref>

The [[Protestantism|Protestant parishes]] preferred lateral churches, in which all the visitors could be as close as possible to the [[pulpit]] and the [[altar]].

==Architecture==
{{main article|Church architecture}}
[[File:Norwich Cathedral from Cloisters, Norfolk, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Norwich Cathedral]] in England is an example of a Cathedral complex built during the [[Middle Ages]].]]
A common architecture for churches is the shape of a [[Christian cross|cross]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=dqIZAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=Remarks on Church Architecture ...|last=Petit|first=John Louis|date=1841|publisher=J. Burns|language=en}}</ref> (a long central rectangle, with side rectangles, and a rectangle in front for the [[altar]] space or sanctuary). These churches also often have a [[dome]] or other large [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] space in the interior to represent or draw attention to the heavens. Other common shapes for churches include a circle, to represent eternity, or an [[octagon]] or similar star shape, to represent the church's bringing light to the world. Another common feature is the [[spire]], a tall tower on the \"west\" end of the church or over the [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]].

Another common feature of many Christian churches is the [[Orientation of churches|eastwards orientation]] of the front [[altar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacredarchitecture.org/articles/sacred_places_the_significance_of_the_church_building/|title=The Institute for Sacred Architecture {{!}} Articles {{!}} Sacred Places: The Significance of the Church Building|website=www.sacredarchitecture.org|access-date=2017-08-16}}</ref> 
Often, the altar will not be oriented due east, but in the direction of sunrise. This tradition originated in Byzantium in the 4th century, and becomes prevalent in the West in the 8th to 9th century. 
The old Roman custom of having the altar at the west end and the entrance at the east was sometimes followed as late as the 11th century even in areas of northern Europe under Frankish rule, as seen in [[Petershausen (Constance)]], [[Bamberg Cathedral]], [[Augsburg Cathedral]], [[Regensburg Cathedral]], and [[Hildesheim Cathedral]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=sX8w667tblMC&pg=PA12&dq=%22XI+Jahrh+fortgedauert%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwir9NbtjObLAhWHDg8KHUFVA8kQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22XI%20Jahrh%20fortgedauert%22&f=false Heinrich Otte, ''Handbuch der kirchlichen Kunst-Archäologie des deutschen Mittelalters'' (Leipzig 1868), p. 12]</ref>

==Types==
===Basilica===
{{main article|Basilica}}
The [[Latin]] word basilica (derived from [[Greek language|Greek]], ''[[Stoa Basileios|Basiliké Stoà]]'', Royal ''[[Stoa]]'') was originally used to describe a [[ancient Rome|Roman]] public building (as in [[Greece]], mainly a [[tribunal]]), usually located in the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] of a Roman town.<ref name=\"OXFORD1\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=Te2dAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA117 ''The Oxford Dictionary of Christian Art and Architecture''] (2013 {{ISBN|978-0-19968027-6}}), p. 117</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacredarchitecture.org/articles/the_eschatological_dimension_of_church_architecture|title=The Institute for Sacred Architecture - Articles- The Eschatological Dimension of Church Architecture|publisher=}}</ref>

After the [[Roman Empire]] became [[Edict of Thessalonica|officially Christian]], the term came by extension to refer to a large and important church that has been given special ceremonial rights by the [[Pope]]. Thus the word retains two senses today, one architectural and the other ecclesiastical.[[File:St. Peter and St. Paul's Church 1, Vilnius, Lithuania - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|Central [[nave]] of [[St. Peter and St. Paul's Church, Vilnius]], Lithuania looking north-east towards the altar. An example of a [[Baroque]] church interior.]]

===Cathedral===

[[File:Sant Vasily cathedral in Moscow.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in [[Moscow]], Russia (today a museum) is a famous and characteristic example of a [[Russian Orthodox Church]] building.]]
A [[cathedral]] is a church, usually [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Anglican]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] or [[Eastern Orthodox]], housing the seat of a bishop. The word cathedral takes its name from ''[[cathedra]]'', or Bishop's Throne (In {{lang-la|ecclesia cathedralis}}). The term is sometimes (improperly) used to refer to any church of great size.

A church that has the function of cathedral is not necessarily a large building. It might be as small as [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford|Christ Church Cathedral]] in [[Oxford]], England, [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh, United States]], or [[Chur]] Cathedral in [[Switzerland]]. However, frequently, the cathedral along with some of the abbey churches, was the [[List of largest buildings in the world|largest building]] in any region.
[[File:Utrecht Domkerk 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht|St. Martin's Cathedral]], [[Utrecht]], Netherlands]]

===Pilgrimage church===
{{main|Pilgrimage church}}
A pilgrimage church is a church to which [[pilgrimage]]s are regularly made, or a church along a pilgrimage route, often located at the tomb of a [[saint]]s, or holding icons or [[relic]]s to which miraculous properties are ascribed, the site of [[Marian apparition]]s, etc.

===Conventual church===
{{see|Priory|Katholikon}}
A conventual church (or monastery church, [[Minster (church)|minster]], ''[[katholikon]]'') is the main church building in a Christian [[monastery]] or [[abbey]].

===Collegiate church===
{{main|Collegiate church}}
A collegiate church is a church where the [[daily office]] of worship is maintained by a [[college (canon law)|college]] of [[canon (priest)|canons]], which may be presided over by a [[Dean (religion)|dean]] or [[Provost (religion)|provost]].
Collegiate churches were often supported by extensive lands held by the church, or by [[tithe]] income from [[impropriation|appropriated]] [[benefices]]. They commonly provide distinct spaces for congregational worship and for the choir offices of their clerical community.

There has been an increase in partnerships between church management and private real estate companies to redevelop church properties into mixed uses. While it has garnered criticism from some, the partnership offers congregations the opportunity to increase revenue while preserving the property.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Churches Redeveloping Properties to Give Them New Life|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/churches-redeveloping-properties-to-give-them-new-life-1443519001|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-10-23|issn = 0099-9660|first = Robyn A.|last = Friedman}}</ref>

{{nihongo foot|'''''Tiger-Heli'''''|タイガー・ヘリ|''Taigā-Heri''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1985 [[shoot'em up|vertical-scrolling shooter]] [[arcade game]] developed by [[Toaplan]]. It was published in Japan by [[Taito]] and in North America by [[Romstar]]. Controlling the titular attack helicopter, the player must fight endless waves of military vehicles while avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles. The Tiger-Heli has a powerful bomb at its disposal that can clear the screen of enemies when fired. It was the first shoot 'em up game from Toaplan, and their third video game overall.

''Tiger-Heli'' was the creation of video game composers Masahiro Yuge and [[Tatsuya Uemura]], who had previously worked on several titles for Japanese companies Orca and Crux before both of them declared bankruptcy in 1984. The development team drew inspiration from the arcade game ''[[Gyrodine]]''. The team wanted to create a scrolling shooter that balanced between being entertaining and fun, and to have players keep wanting to play it after dying. The staff chose a helicopter as the player's craft as they felt it would work for a game that had the screen continuously scrolling. The soundtrack, composed by Uemura, was made to convey a sense of bravery, which was hampered by technical limitations.

''Tiger-Heli'' was well-received by critics for its gameplay, graphics and weapons, and helped establish Toaplan as a leading producer of shooting games throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] by [[Micronics]], a conversion that was commended for its accurate portrayal of the arcade original. The NES version sold over one million copies. A [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was released in 1996 by [[Banpresto]] as part of the compilation ''Toaplan Shooting Battle 1''. It was followed by two sequels: ''[[Twin Cobra]]'' in 1987, and ''[[Twin Cobra II]]'' in 1995. The rights to ''Tiger-Heli'' are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese developer formed by Yuge and other former Toaplan employees.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:ARC Tiger-Heli.png|thumb|right|Arcade version screenshot.]]
''Tiger-Heli'' is a military-themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game, in which players take control of the titular attack helicopter through four increasingly difficult levels in order to defeat an assortment of military enemy forces like [[tank]]s, [[battleship]]s, and [[artillery]] as the main objective.<ref name=\"T-HACmanual\">''Tiger-Heli'' instruction manual (Arcade, US)</ref><ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\">''Tiger-Heli'' Game Pak Instructions (Nintendo Entertainment System, US)</ref><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\">{{cite web|last=Zverloff|first=Nick|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tiger-heli/|title=Tiger-Heli|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=3 July 2011|access-date=2019-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402223234/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tiger-heli/|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Besides some [[airplane]]s taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a [[helipad]] is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of half the screen's height and two [[bomb]]s.

A unique gameplay feature is the bomb mechanic; unlike other games in the genre released at the time, the bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its [[blast radius]].<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/> The bombs also act as a shield against incoming enemy fire, however, as they can be triggered after taking enemy hits as well. There are also three types of [[Item (gaming)|item]]s scattered through every stage in total that appear as destructible flashing [[cross]]es: extra bomb stocks and two variations of helicopter \"options\" that attack at the player's will against incoming enemies, while is also possible to mix and match the two helicopter option types, totaling no more than two.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> These items can be picked up by shooting their respective cross color but grabbing any item when not necessary yields a 3000 point bonus.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/>

The player are given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 20000 points and every 80000 points thereafter, in addition of collecting ten [[gold]] [[diamond]]s in a row by shooting them.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/> Firing on determined locations is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives, as certain [[setpiece]]s in some stages hosts a bonus secret within their scenery.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> There are also hidden bonus secrets to be found as well. The game employs a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying.<ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as the helicopter options and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]] unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. After completing the last stage, the game begins again with the second loop increasing in difficulty and enemies fire denser [[bullet]] patterns.<ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/>

== Development ==
''Tiger-Heli'' was created under the working title ''Cobra'' by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Orca and Crux before both companies declared bankruptcy in 1984, after which a group of employees from the two gaming divisions would go on to form Toaplan and among them were [[Video game composer|composer]]s Masahiro Yuge and Tatsuya Uemura, both of which recounted the project's development process and history between [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] and [[2012 in video gaming|2012]] through Japanese publications such as ''Shooting Gameside''.<ref name=\"PSGv10\">{{cite magazine|last=Abeto|first=Kobatsu|title=東亜プランインタビュー|magazine=PSG|volume=10|publisher=FSG|date=September 1989|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531193430/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/|date=2017-05-31}}).</ref><ref name=\"G49\">{{cite magazine|author=|title=東亜プラン|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=49|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=September 1990|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107033548/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/|date=2019-11-07}}).</ref><ref name=\"THf25v9a\">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=東亜プラン FOREVER (1/5)|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|publisher=|date=June 2009|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219234827/http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation|date=2011-02-19}}).</ref><ref name=\"THf25v9b\">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=東亜プラン FOREVER (2/5)|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|publisher=|date=June 2009|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation&p=2 Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224034931/http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation&p=2|date=2013-02-24}}).</ref><ref name=\"THf25v9c\">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=東亜プラン FOREVER (3/5)|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|publisher=|date=June 2009|page=|lang=ja}} ([https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332&p=3 Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191122014305/https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332&p=3|date=2019-11-22}}).</ref><ref name=\"TSCa\">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|title=東亜プラン シューティングクロニクル|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=14 November 2011|access-date=2020-02-15|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021030143/https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|archive-date=2019-10-21|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711134859/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/|date=2018-07-11}}).</ref><ref name=\"TSCb\">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|title=東亜プラン シューティングクロニクル 特設ページ|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=27 October 2011|access-date=2020-02-15|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215231114/https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|archive-date=2020-02-15|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002072400/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/|date=2019-10-02}}).</ref><ref name=\"STGv4a\">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Yūsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=東亜プラン特集  - 元・東亜プラン　開発者インタビュー: 上村建也|magazine=Shooting Gameside|volume=4|publisher=Micro Magazine|date=3 February 2012|pages=33-40|lang=ja|ISBN=978-4896373844}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-uemura1/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906023755/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-uemura1/|date=2019-09-06}}).</ref> The team wanted to create a game that balanced frustrating and entertaining sections, as well as inciting audiences to keep playing after losing a live and progress further, though the idea of playing as a helicopter was influenced by ''Gyrodine'' because the team felt it could work as a shoot 'em up title where the screen kept scrolling.<ref name=\"TSCb\"/><ref name=\"STGv4a\"/>

When creating the artwork for ''Tiger-Heli'', which has been described as \"[[polygonal]]\" in recent interviews, Toaplan was realizing research for a possible [[flight simulator]] they could develop themselves and one of the project's [[Video game designer|designer]]s implemented a sample image from the simulator into the game.<ref name=\"TSCb\"/> The concept of using a bomb in a shoot 'em up game came up during development, where the team questioned how to make the title more engaging for players but it was never intended for defensive purposes according to them, as the mechanic was instead implemented to provide a aggressive feeling against enemies during difficult situations in the title.<ref name=\"TSCb\"/><ref name=\"STGv4a\"/> Several other features were integrated into the project as a way to keep audiences playing such as the continuous stage scrolling during the high score screen, which was akin to a [[drama]].<ref name=\"TSCb\"/> According to Uemura, development was financed with the team's own funds, as Taito solely focused on distribution and Toaplan's name could not be displayed in the game due to contractual arrangements.<ref name=\"TSCa\"/><ref name=\"STGv4a\"/> 

The [[Soundtrack#Video game soundtracks|soundtrack]] was composed by Uemura, who also created the [[sound effects]].<ref name=\"VGMDB\">{{cite web|url=https://vgmdb.net/album/1245|title=D28B-0008 &#124; KYUKYOKU TIGER -G.S.M.TAITO 2-|work=vgmdb.net|publisher=VGMdb|access-date=2020-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803090922/http://vgmdb.net/album/1245|archive-date=2017-08-03|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplanmusic/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022183049/http://shmuplations.com/toaplanmusic/|date=2019-10-22}}).</ref> When writing the music during development, Uemura intended the songs to convey a sense of bravery but he was limited due to technical and memory restrictions at the time of release.<ref name=\"VGMDB\"/>

== Release ==
''Tiger-Heli'' was released in arcades across Japan and North America on October 1985 by Taito and Romstar.<ref name=\"MBASICM112\"/> On 21 November 1988, an album containing music from the title and its sequel was co-published exclusively in Japan by [[Scitron]] and Pony Canyon.<ref name=\"VGMDB\"/>

On 5 December 1986, a Nintendo Entertainment System port of ''Tiger-Heli'' developed by Micronics was first released in Japan by [[Pony Canyon]]. It was then released in North America by [[Acclaim Entertainment]], who also distributed the title across Europe on January 1990.<ref name=\"T-Htuhovg\">{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Steven L.|authorlink=Steven L.

On 30 August 1996, Banpresto released a compilation for the PlayStation exclusively in Japan titled ''Toaplan Shooting Battle 1'', which included both arcade versions of ''Tiger-Heli'' and its sequel, an arranged soundtrack by Uemura and other additions.<ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/><ref name=\"STGv4a\"/>

{{nihongo foot|'''''Tiger-Heli'''''|タイガー・ヘリ|''Taigā-Heri''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1985 [[shoot'em up|vertical-scrolling shooter]] [[arcade game]] developed by [[Toaplan]]. It was published in Japan by [[Taito]] and in North America by [[Romstar]]. Controlling the titular attack helicopter, the player must fight endless waves of military vehicles while avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles. The Tiger-Heli has a powerful bomb at its disposal that can clear the screen of enemies when fired. It was the first shoot 'em up game from Toaplan, and their third video game overall.

''Tiger-Heli'' was the creation of video game composers Masahiro Yuge and [[Tatsuya Uemura]], who had previously worked on several titles for Japanese companies Orca and Crux before both of them declared bankruptcy in 1984. The development team drew inspiration from the arcade game ''[[Gyrodine]]''. The team wanted to create a scrolling shooter that balanced between being entertaining and fun, and to have players keep wanting to play it after dying. The staff chose a helicopter as the player's craft as they felt it would work for a game that had the screen continuously scrolling. The soundtrack, composed by Uemura, was made to convey a sense of bravery, which was hampered by technical limitations.

''Tiger-Heli'' was well-received by critics for its gameplay, graphics and weapons, and helped establish Toaplan as a leading producer of shooting games throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It was ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] by [[Micronics]], a conversion that was commended for its accurate portrayal of the arcade original. The NES version sold over one million copies. A [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was released in 1996 by [[Banpresto]] as part of the compilation ''Toaplan Shooting Battle 1''. It was followed by two sequels: ''[[Twin Cobra]]'' in 1987, and ''[[Twin Cobra II]]'' in 1995. The rights to ''Tiger-Heli'' are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese developer formed by Yuge and other former Toaplan employees.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:ARC Tiger-Heli.png|thumb|right|Arcade version screenshot.]]
''Tiger-Heli'' is a military-themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game, in which players take control of the titular attack helicopter through four increasingly difficult levels in order to defeat an assortment of military enemy forces like [[tank]]s, [[battleship]]s, and [[artillery]] as the main objective.<ref name=\"T-HACmanual\">''Tiger-Heli'' instruction manual (Arcade, US)</ref><ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\">''Tiger-Heli'' Game Pak Instructions (Nintendo Entertainment System, US)</ref><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\">{{cite web|last=Zverloff|first=Nick|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tiger-heli/|title=Tiger-Heli|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=3 July 2011|access-date=2019-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402223234/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tiger-heli/|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Besides some [[airplane]]s taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a [[helipad]] is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of half the screen's height and two [[bomb]]s.

A unique gameplay feature is the bomb mechanic; unlike other games in the genre released at the time, the bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its [[blast radius]].<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/> The bombs also act as a shield against incoming enemy fire, however, as they can be triggered after taking enemy hits as well. There are also three types of [[Item (gaming)|item]]s scattered through every stage in total that appear as destructible flashing [[cross]]es: extra bomb stocks and two variations of helicopter \"options\" that attack at the player's will against incoming enemies, while is also possible to mix and match the two helicopter option types, totaling no more than two.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> These items can be picked up by shooting their respective cross color but grabbing any item when not necessary yields a 3000 point bonus.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/>

The player are given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 20000 points and every 80000 points thereafter, in addition of collecting ten [[gold]] [[diamond]]s in a row by shooting them.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/> Firing on determined locations is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives, as certain [[setpiece]]s in some stages hosts a bonus secret within their scenery.<ref name=\"T-HNESmanual\"/><ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> There are also hidden bonus secrets to be found as well. The game employs a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying.<ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/> Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as the helicopter options and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]] unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. After completing the last stage, the game begins again with the second loop increasing in difficulty and enemies fire denser [[bullet]] patterns.<ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/>

== Development ==
''Tiger-Heli'' was created under the working title ''Cobra'' by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Orca and Crux before both companies declared bankruptcy in 1984, after which a group of employees from the two gaming divisions would go on to form Toaplan and among them were [[Video game composer|composer]]s Masahiro Yuge and Tatsuya Uemura, both of which recounted the project's development process and history between [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] and [[2012 in video gaming|2012]] through Japanese publications such as ''Shooting Gameside''.<ref name=\"PSGv10\">{{cite magazine|last=Abeto|first=Kobatsu|title=東亜プランインタビュー|magazine=PSG|volume=10|publisher=FSG|date=September 1989|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531193430/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/|date=2017-05-31}}).</ref><ref name=\"G49\">{{cite magazine|author=|title=東亜プラン|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=49|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=September 1990|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107033548/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/|date=2019-11-07}}).</ref><ref name=\"THf25v9a\">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=東亜プラン FOREVER (1/5)|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|publisher=|date=June 2009|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219234827/http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation|date=2011-02-19}}).</ref><ref name=\"THf25v9b\">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=東亜プラン FOREVER (2/5)|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|publisher=|date=June 2009|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation&p=2 Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224034931/http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2332&type=translation&p=2|date=2013-02-24}}).</ref><ref name=\"THf25v9c\">{{cite magazine|author1=Iona|author2=VHS|author3=K-HEX|title=東亜プラン FOREVER (3/5)|magazine=Floor 25|volume=9|publisher=|date=June 2009|page=|lang=ja}} ([https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332&p=3 Translation] by Gamengai. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191122014305/https://www.gamengai.com/#/cmnt-info?id=2332&p=3|date=2019-11-22}}).</ref><ref name=\"TSCa\">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|title=東亜プラン シューティングクロニクル|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=14 November 2011|access-date=2020-02-15|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021030143/https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|archive-date=2019-10-21|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711134859/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/|date=2018-07-11}}).</ref><ref name=\"TSCb\">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|title=東亜プラン シューティングクロニクル 特設ページ|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=27 October 2011|access-date=2020-02-15|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215231114/https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|archive-date=2020-02-15|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002072400/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/|date=2019-10-02}}).</ref><ref name=\"STGv4a\">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Yūsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=東亜プラン特集  - 元・東亜プラン　開発者インタビュー: 上村建也|magazine=Shooting Gameside|volume=4|publisher=Micro Magazine|date=3 February 2012|pages=33-40|lang=ja|ISBN=978-4896373844}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-uemura1/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906023755/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-uemura1/|date=2019-09-06}}).</ref> The team wanted to create a game that balanced frustrating and entertaining sections, as well as inciting audiences to keep playing after losing a live and progress further, though the idea of playing as a helicopter was influenced by ''Gyrodine'' because the team felt it could work as a shoot 'em up title where the screen kept scrolling.<ref name=\"TSCb\"/><ref name=\"STGv4a\"/>

When creating the artwork for ''Tiger-Heli'', which has been described as \"[[polygonal]]\" in recent interviews, Toaplan was realizing research for a possible [[flight simulator]] they could develop themselves and one of the project's [[Video game designer|designer]]s implemented a sample image from the simulator into the game.<ref name=\"TSCb\"/> The concept of using a bomb in a shoot 'em up game came up during development, where the team questioned how to make the title more engaging for players but it was never intended for defensive purposes according to them, as the mechanic was instead implemented to provide a aggressive feeling against enemies during difficult situations in the title.<ref name=\"TSCb\"/><ref name=\"STGv4a\"/> Several other features were integrated into the project as a way to keep audiences playing such as the continuous stage scrolling during the high score screen, which was akin to a [[drama]].<ref name=\"TSCb\"/> According to Uemura, development was financed with the team's own funds, as Taito solely focused on distribution and Toaplan's name could not be displayed in the game due to contractual arrangements.<ref name=\"TSCa\"/><ref name=\"STGv4a\"/> 

The [[Soundtrack#Video game soundtracks|soundtrack]] was composed by Uemura, who also created the [[sound effects]].<ref name=\"VGMDB\">{{cite web|url=https://vgmdb.net/album/1245|title=D28B-0008 &#124; KYUKYOKU TIGER -G.S.M.TAITO 2-|work=vgmdb.net|publisher=VGMdb|access-date=2020-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803090922/http://vgmdb.net/album/1245|archive-date=2017-08-03|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplanmusic/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022183049/http://shmuplations.com/toaplanmusic/|date=2019-10-22}}).</ref> When writing the music during development, Uemura intended the songs to convey a sense of bravery but he was limited due to technical and memory restrictions at the time of release.<ref name=\"VGMDB\"/>

== Release ==
''Tiger-Heli'' was released in arcades across Japan and North America on October 1985 by Taito and Romstar.<ref name=\"MBASICM112\"/> On 21 November 1988, an album containing music from the title and its sequel was co-published exclusively in Japan by [[Scitron]] and Pony Canyon.<ref name=\"VGMDB\"/>

On 5 December 1986, a Nintendo Entertainment System port of ''Tiger-Heli'' developed by Micronics was first released in Japan by [[Pony Canyon]]. It was then released in North America by [[Acclaim Entertainment]], who also distributed the title across Europe on January 1990.<ref name=\"T-Htuhovg\">{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Steven L.|authorlink=Steven L.

On 30 August 1996, Banpresto released a compilation for the PlayStation exclusively in Japan titled ''Toaplan Shooting Battle 1'', which included both arcade versions of ''Tiger-Heli'' and its sequel, an arranged soundtrack by Uemura and other additions.<ref name=\"T-Hhg101\"/><ref name=\"STGv4a\"/>

Updated one link,safe,Newtack101,"A '''political family''' (also referred to as '''political dynasty''') is a [[family]] in which several members are involved in [[politics]] and [[businesses]], particularly [[Election|electoral politics]]. Members may be related by blood or marriage; often several [[generation]]s or multiple [[sibling]]s may be involved.

A [[royal family]] or [[dynasty]] in a [[monarchy]] is generally considered to not be a \"political family,\" although the later descendants of a royal family have played political roles in a [[republic]] (such as the [[Arslan family]] of [[Lebanon]] would be). A [[family dictatorship]] is a form of [[dictatorship]] that operates much like an [[absolute monarchy]], yet occurs in a nominally republican state.

==United States==
{{Main article|List of United States political families}}
In the United States, many political dynasties (having at least two generations serving in political office) have arisen since the country's founding:

===Presidential===
[[file:Seal of the President of the United States.svg|right|185px|thumb|Four noted U.S. political families — Adams, Harrison, Roosevelt, Bush — have had two members that served as President of the United States]]
Four noted U.S. political families — Adams, Harrison, Roosevelt, Bush — have had two members that served as President of the United States.
*The first dynasty with presidential connections was the Adams family. [[John Adams]] served as the second President (after serving as the first vice president), and his son [[John Quincy Adams]] served as the sixth president. John Quincy's son [[Charles Francis Adams Sr.|Charles]] served as U.S. ambassador (then called minister) to the United Kingdom and as a U.S. congressman. A fourth-generation member of the family ([[John Quincy Adams II]]) served as a state representative in Massachusetts, and his son [[Charles Francis Adams III|Charles]] was mayor of [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] and secretary of the Navy in the Hoover administration.
*Another early political dynasty was the Harrison family, of which six generations served in public office from the late 18th through mid 20th centuries. [[Benjamin Harrison V]] was one of the early governors of Virginia and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. His son [[William Henry Harrison]] was the ninth U.S. President. William's son [[John Scott Harrison]] served in the U.S. House of Representatives, while his son [[Benjamin Harrison]] became the 23rd President (marking the first and only grandfather and grandson to serve as president). Benjamin's son [[Russell Benjamin Harrison]] served as a state representative and state senator from Indiana in the 1920s, and Russell's son [[William H. Harrison (Wyoming politician)|William]] served in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1950s and '60s.
[[file:Theodore Roosevelt and family, 1903.jpg|right|thumb|185px|[[Theodore Roosevelt]] and family]]
[[file:Kennedy family on jpk birthday sept 1963.jpg|right|thumb|185px|The [[Kennedy Family|Kennedys]]]]
*The [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]-based [[Taft family]] has had a legacy of public service ranging from the late 19th through early 21st century. [[Alphonso Taft]] served in President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s cabinet. Two of his sons followed him into public service: [[Charles Phelps Taft]] served as a U.S. congressman, and [[William Howard Taft]] was the 27th President and later [[U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice]] (the only one to hold both offices). William Howard's sons: [[Robert A. Taft]] was a long-serving U.S. senator (and for a time Senate Majority Leader), and [[Charles Phelps Taft II]] served as mayor of the family's hometown of Cincinnati. The fourth generation of Tafts includes [[Robert Taft Jr.]], who served as a U.S. congressman and senator, and [[Seth Taft]], who was commissioner of [[Cuyahoga County]] (Cleveland area). [[Bob Taft|Robert III (better known as Bob)]] served as governor of Ohio at the turn of the 21st century.
*The New York-based [[Roosevelt family]] produced two presidents. [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore]] (#26), and [[Franklin Roosevelt|Franklin]] (aka FDR, the 32nd president and the only one to serve more than two terms), were fifth cousins by blood but uncle and nephew by marriage: FDR was married to Theodore's niece [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], daughter of Theodore's younger brother Elliott. Eleanor served as an informal adviser to her husband during his presidency, served as U.S. representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights during the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, and chaired the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women during the Kennedy administration. [[Theodore Roosevelt Jr.]] served as governor of [[Puerto Rico]] and [[The Philippines]] and as a New York state assemblyman. [[Theodore Roosevelt III|Theodore III]] served as Pennsylvania's secretary of Commerce. FDR and Eleanor's sons, [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr.]] and [[James Roosevelt]] served in the U.S. House of Representatives; and Elliott Roosevelt served as mayor of Miami Beach, Florida.
*In the early to mid 20th century, the Massachusetts-based [[Kennedy family]] became one of the most prominent political dynasties in American history. Patriarch [[P. J. Kennedy|Patrick Joseph Kennedy]] served as a Massachusetts state representative and state senator. His son [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] served as U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom. The children of Joseph P. Kennedy include [[John F. Kennedy]] (aka JFK, 35th President of the United States), [[Robert F. Kennedy]] (aka RFK, U.S. Senator and Attorney General), [[Ted Kennedy]] (U.S. Senator), and Jean Kennedy Smith, U.S. ambassador to Ireland. The next generation includes former U.S. congressmen [[Joseph Patrick Kennedy II]] and [[Patrick Joseph Kennedy II]], former U.S. Ambassador to Japan [[Caroline Kennedy]], former Maryland Lt. Governor [[Kathleen Kennedy Townsend]], former Maryland House of Delegates member Mark Shriver, Connecticut state Sen. [[Edward Kennedy Jr.]], and former Santa Monica, California mayor Bobby Shriver. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who at the time was married to [[Maria Shriver]] (niece of JFK, RFK, and Ted), served as governor of California (Maria Shriver served as First Lady and founded the California Museum) throughout most of the 2000s. The fifth generation includes U.S. Rep. [[Joseph Kennedy III]]<ref>KQED, General Article: The Kennedys in Politics, <http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/kennedys-politics/></ref>
[[file:George W. Bush and family.jpg|right|thumb|185px|The [[Bush Family]]]]
*[[Peter Schweizer]] describes the [[Bush family]] as \"the most successful political dynasty in American history.\"<ref>Joseph Curl (January 20, 2005). \"Rise of 'dynasty' quick, far-reaching\". ''The Washington Times''. Archived from the original on 2006-03-19.</ref> Four generations have served in elective office: [[Prescott Bush]] served in the U.S. Senate. His son [[George H.W.

Another of George H.W.'s sons, [[Jeb Bush]], served as governor of Florida, and Jeb's son [[George P. Bush]] serves as [[Texas Land Commissioner]].
[[file:Trump Family Hand Up.jpg|right|thumb|185px|The [[Trump family|Trumps]]]]
*[[Bill Clinton]] served as the 42nd U.S. president, after having served as attorney general and governor of Arkansas. His uncle, Roy Clinton, served in the Arkansas state legislature in the 1950s. President Clinton's wife, [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], served as U.S. senator from New York from 2001-09 and U.S. Secretary of State in the Obama administration, and was the 2016 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee for [[President of the United States]].<ref>Feldmann, Linda.

Why Political Dynasties Might Make Sense. (+video).\"] ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' 23 July 2014</ref>
*[[family of Donald Trump|The current U.S. First Family, the Trumps]], initially gained fame as a [[Trump Organization|New York City-based business dynasty]], then as [[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|reality TV stars]], but can be considered a political dynasty as well.

[[Category:Political families| ]]
[[Category:Oligarchy]]","A '''political family''' (also referred to as '''political dynasty''') is a [[family]] in which several members are involved in [[politics]] and [[businesses]], particularly [[Election|electoral politics]]. Members may be related by blood or marriage; often several [[generation]]s or multiple [[sibling]]s may be involved.

A [[royal family]] or [[dynasty]] in a [[monarchy]] is generally considered to not be a \"political family,\" although the later descendants of a royal family have played political roles in a [[republic]] (such as the [[Arslan family]] of [[Lebanon]] would be). A [[family dictatorship]] is a form of [[dictatorship]] that operates much like an [[absolute monarchy]], yet occurs in a nominally republican state.

==United States==
{{Main article|List of United States political families}}
In the United States, many political dynasties (having at least two generations serving in political office) have arisen since the country's founding:

===Presidential===

'''James Michael Calvert''' (6 March 1913 – 26 November 1998) was a British soldier involved in [[special operations]] in [[Burma]] during the [[Second World War]]. He participated in both [[Chindit]] operations and was instrumental in popularizing the unorthodox ideas of [[Orde Wingate|General Orde Wingate]]. He frequently led attacks from the front, a practice that earned him the nickname amongst the men under his command of \"Mad Mike.\"

==Early life==
Calvert was born at [[Rohtak]] in [[British India|India]], son of a member of the [[Indian Civil Service]]. He was educated at [[Bradfield College]] and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], from which was commissioned as a [[subaltern]] into the British Army's [[Royal Engineers]] as a professional soldier.<ref>Obituary for Calvert. 'The Independent', 2 December 1998.</ref>

==Military career==
Calvert was commissioned into the [[Royal Engineers]] in 1933, and for a time was the Army's [[middleweight]] boxing champion. He spent a year reading for the Mechanical Engineering [[Tripos]] at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St. John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].<ref>Obituary for Calvert, 'The Independent', 2 December 1998. https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-brigadier-michael-calvert-1188603.html</ref> In 1934 he returned to active service and was posted to the [[Hong Kong]] Royal Engineers, where he learned to speak [[Cantonese]]. He also witnessed the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese Army's]] attack on [[Shanghai]] and the [[Rape of Nanking]], which made him one of the few officers in the British Army pre-World War 2 who fully appreciated the nature of the threat posed by Japanese imperialism.

When the [[Second World War]] broke out in 1939 Calvert briefly commanded a detachment of Royal Engineers in the [[Norwegian Campaign]], then trained [[commando]] detachments in [[demolition]] techniques in Hong Kong and Australia. In Australia, along with [[F. Spencer Chapman]], he assisted with training Australian commandos who formed the first [[Australian Army Independent Companies]] at [[Wilsons Promontory]], Victoria in 1941. He was then appointed to command the '''Bush Warfare School''' in [[Burma]], training officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s to lead guerilla bands in China for operations against the Japanese.

The Japanese invaded Burma in early 1942. Calvert and others from the school raided [[Henzada]] by riverboat after the fall of [[Rangoon]] as a deception operation to convince the Japanese that Australian reinforcements had reached Burma. Calvert then spent a period of time touring Burma with [[Orde Wingate]]. After the Bush Warfare School closed, Calvert was sent with 22 men from the school and a few hundred men separated from their units to guard the Gokteik Viaduct thirty miles east of [[Maymyo]]. (The Allied Commander in Chief, General [[Archibald Wavell]] apparently hoped that Calvert would use his initiative and demolish it, in spite of orders from the civil government to keep it intact. For once, Calvert obeyed orders.)<ref>Allen (1984), p.136</ref>

After retreating from the viaduct, Calvert participated in a deception operation involving the loss of a set of false papers to the Japanese. Calvert's unit finally retreated to India at the very rear of the army, often behind the Japanese lines.

===Operation Longcloth===
In India, he reunited with the equally unorthodox Wingate, and the two became firm friends. Calvert led one of the company-sized columns in [[Operation Longcloth]], Wingate's first [[Chindit]] operation in 1943. This was a long-range penetration operation behind enemy lines, which put great demands on the endurance of all who took part. Calvert was awarded the DSO for his achievements on the operation. His column achieved the greatest amount of demolition of the Japanese lines of communication, and reached India intact with the fewest casualties of those in the force.<ref>Allen (1984), pp.128-143</ref>

===Operation Thursday===
====The Fly-In====
Calvert commanded the [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade]] in [[Operation Thursday]], the much larger second Chindit operation. His brigade spearheaded the airborne landings deep in the Japanese rear. The operation was staged from Lalaghat, with D-Day fixed for 5 March. That morning, one of General [[Philip Cochran]]'s [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchells]] flew over and photographed the landing zones. Wingate had ordered that no aircraft should fly over the landing zones, lest the operation be betrayed, but Cochran was not directly under Wingate's command and felt that launching the operation without accurate intelligence was a dangerous gamble.<ref>Bidwell, 1979: 104–5</ref> The photographs clearly showed that one of landing sites selected, codenamed Piccadilly, was unusable.

<blockquote>It was at this dramatic moment, with everyone keyed up and ready to go, that the aerial photographs arrived. They showed that primary landing site Broadway was clear, but Piccadilly had been blocked by tree trunks; no gliders would land there that night. The general opinion was that the Japs had realized the possibilities of Piccadilly as a landing area and had deliberately blocked it, though some time later we discovered that the explanation was much simpler: Burmese woodmen had laid out their trees to dry in the clearing.<ref>Calvert, 1964: 140</ref></blockquote>

Wingate was enraged by Cochran's actions but admitted that the danger was real. He and Calvert weighed the options. The danger of executing a potentially compromised operation were substantial, but any delay threatened to push back the window of opportunity by at least a month. Of the three planned sites only two were available; Calvert suggested the plan be further altered and the entire brigade flown into Broadway. He said, \"I am prepared to take the whole of my brigade into Broadway and do without [second landing site] Piccadilly.\"<ref>Bidwell, 1979: 106</ref> Calvert later wrote, \"We had taken into account that [third landing site] Chowringhee was to the east of the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]] while Broadway was west of the river. I told Wingate, 'I don't want to split my brigade either side of the Irrawaddy. I am prepared to take all the brigade into Broadway alone and take the consequence of a slower build-up.'\"<ref>Calvert, 1964: 141</ref> Lieutenant General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]] \"asked Calvert…and found him strongly against [using] Chowringhee.\"<ref>Slim, 1957: 259</ref> Further discussion with Slim and Wingate clinched the matter: \"it was to be Broadway alone. I was nervous as bales, I imagine we all were, but we all knew we had to go…In any case Broadway was clear and I could really see no reason why we should not go in there just because Piccadilly was blocked.\"<ref>Calvert, 1964: 141</ref>

Each American [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] towed two heavily laden [[Waco CG-4]] gliders. Although a double tow posed no problems for a competent pilot in good weather, many of the pilots were inexperienced and the route across the mountain ranges bordering the [[Chindwin river]] guaranteed a turbulent, unsettled flight. The first gliders were scheduled to arrive at Broadway by 9:30pm, but by 2:00am Wingate and the others waiting at Lalaghat had not yet heard from Calvert. Poor reconnaissance, not enemy resistance, caused the delay, as aerial reconnaissance had failed to show a number of ditches scarring the field at Broadway. Calvert wrote:

<blockquote>All six of the advance party gliders had landed and the plan had been that we would wheel them off to make way for the next batch, which would in turn be wheeled away and so on. But we had reckoned without the ditches. Three of the six gliders were so badly wrecked that the small force at present on the ground could not shift them. We worked at them furiously but suddenly I heard a shout and looked up. In the bright light of the moon I saw to my horror that the first two of the next batch had cast off [their tows] and were winging their silent way down.<ref>Calvert, 1964: 143</ref></blockquote>

Calvert transmitted the prearranged signal \"Soya Link\", the most despised of ration items, to stop all flying, but at 6:30am on 6 March he radioed the code words \"Pork Sausage\" to resume flights into Broadway. A strip for C-47s was in place that evening, and supplies came rushing in. Calvert lost no time in organizing reconnaissance missions and fortifying Broadway. By 13 March the build-up was complete. In seven nights about 9,000 men, 1,350 animals, 250 tons of supplies and weapons had landed behind enemy lines in Burma.<ref>Calvert, 1964: 148</ref>

====Broadway====
On 17 March he led a [[bayonet]] charge against Japanese positions shielded by a sunken road and a steep hill crowned with a pagoda. Calvert noticed that friendly forces nearby were drawing heavier fire. In fact, elements of the South Staffordshire Regiment had dug in adjacent to a Japanese unit. Neither force was aware of the other.<ref>Bidwell, 1979: 199</ref> Deciding that something had to be done, he elected to make a frontal assault:

<blockquote>I saw something had to be done pretty quickly, so I shouted to Freddie that we were going to charge. I then told everyone that we were going to charge the Pagoda Hill. There were reinforcements on our left flank who would charge as well. So, standing up, I shouted out 'Charge' in the approved Victorian manner, and ran down the hill…Half of the [[South Staffordshire Regiment|South Staffords]] joined in. Then looking back I found a lot had not. So I told them to bloody well 'Charge, what the hell do you think you're doing.' So they charged. Machine-gunners, mortar teams, all officers – everybody who was on that hill<ref>Calvert, 1952:50</ref></blockquote>

The fighting quickly degenerated into a free-for-all. Calvert characterized the action as an \"extraordinary mêlée…everyone shooting, bayoneting, kicking at everyone else, rather like an officers' guest night.\"<ref>Calvert, 1952: 50</ref> [[George Albert Cairns|Lieutenant George Cairns]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for killing several Japanese after one severed his left arm with a sword. A pause in the fighting turned into a stalemate, complete with shouting – according to Calvert \"[t]he Japs were yelling at us in English, 'You dirty hairy bastards,' etc.; only a final charge made by Calvert and some [[Gurkha]]s dislodged the Japanese. Many of these were shot as they retreated.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 51</ref> Afterward, \"the hill was a horrid sight, littered with Jap dead, and already the ones who had been killed there earlier in the day were black with flies. Stretcher-bearers were removing our wounded and our mercifully very few dead.\"<ref>Norman Durant quoted in Bidwell, 1979: 122</ref>

Shortly after this action a lieutenant in the South Staffordshire Regiment, Norman Durant, wrote a compelling description of Calvert in a letter to his parents:

<blockquote>His hair flops over his forehead, and he has a disconcerting habit of staring at you when you speak to him and yet not appearing to hear a word. His lectures were always painfully slow and hesitant and during training he gave the impression of taking a long time to make up his mind; in action things were very different. He knows all the officers in the brigade and many of the senior NCOs, and his manner and attitude are always the same if he is talking to a CO, a subaltern or a private…<ref>Norman Durant quoted in Bidwell, 1979: 118–19</ref></blockquote>

Calvert's dedication to the troops under his command was one of his most visible attributes. According to David Rooney he was \"one of the most successful of the Chindit leaders [and] showed his greatness as a commander by reminding his men that, however bad things were for them, things were probably much worse for the enemy.\"<ref>Rooney, 1995: 98</ref>

====White City====
The brigade then captured and held a position near Mawlu. Calvert \"saw that Mawlu [the location of the block] was the crucial point for road and rail traffic and determined to build up a defensive box there.\"<ref>Rooney, 1995: 126</ref> Because of the supply drop parachutes adorning the surrounding jungle, it became known as the White City. This fortified position blocked Japanese road and rail communications to their northern front for over two months. A large rectangle, 1,000 by 800 yards, White City was quickly identified by the Japanese as a threat. Probing attacks on 18, 19, and 20 March inflicted a handful of casualties, but were beaten back without significant loss. The Japanese mounted a serious attack on the night of 21 March that resulted in \"[v]ery confused close-quarter fighting\" that lasted all night. Two Japanese light machine guns were established in the block; a dawn attack led by flamethrower-equipped infantry displaced the Japanese, driving them outside the perimeter. Calvert was instrumental in orchestrating the counterattacks and was frequently under fire.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 52–57</ref>

After repulsing numerous nighttime attacks, Calvert had two relatively quiet weeks to fortify White City. Under his direction a thick hedge of barbed wire was put in place and surrounded with mines and booby traps. Firing positions were dug in and camouflaged; reinforced with logs and earth, these positions were invisible and all-but impenetrable. Calvert also established a defensive fire plan to coordinate machine gun and mortar fire. Some [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder|2-pounder anti-tank guns]] arrived on 29 March and were quickly put in place. These were followed by engineers who built a landing strip capable of handling [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] cargo aircraft, which delivered more artillery. White City was eventually defended by four anti-tank guns, six [[Bofors 40 mm]] [[autocannon]]s and four [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25-pounders]].<ref>Bidwell, 1979: 125</ref> Calvert had a not insubstantial arsenal at his disposal.

On 6 April the White City again came under attack. The Japanese shelled and bombed the block throughout the afternoon. Calvert recalled that the terrain combined with meticulous attention to detail in constructing the positions provided shelter, and that casualties were low.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 109–10</ref> The only effective weapon the Japanese possessed was a 6-inch [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], an old coastal defence piece they had laboriously dragged through the jungle to bombard the block. The mortar fired a bomb four and a half feet long that was in flight for more than 30 seconds.<ref>Allen, 1998: 353</ref> Calvert described the mortar as \"the bane of our existence.\"<ref>Calvert, 1952: 109</ref> Calvert spent the attack in a dugout, coordinating his troops' response via telephone. He reported that stiff resistance led by his friend Ian MacPherson prevented the Japanese from breaching the block.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 110–11</ref>

From 6 April through 11 April, Calvert wrote, \"[t]he sequence of attack was the same practically every night and only varied in intensity.\" Japanese infantry attacked after dark, invariably running into stiff resistance from emplaced machine guns, mines, barbed wire, booby traps, artillery, and sustained rifle fire.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 112</ref> The Japanese brought forward two light tanks; these were quickly destroyed with 2-pounder anti-tank guns. Confident in the block's ability to withstand any attack, Calvert's only concern was his rapidly dwindling supply of ammunition. Machine gun ammunition was being used at a frantic pace. In all, some 700,000 rounds of [[Vickers machine gun]] ammunition were dropped into White City. Calvert requested that supply drops contain less food and more ammunition.<ref>Allen, 1998: 353</ref>

Calvert led several counter-attacks against encircling Japanese forces in person. On 13 April he commanded a much larger attack involving most of the brigade. Despite the intervention of American [[P-51 Mustang]]s, the attack was a failure; Calvert was forced to order a retreat. He learned that Major Ian MacPherson, commander of the headquarters company of the 77th Brigade had been killed, his body left in the Japanese positions. Calvert said he \"could not leave anyone like that without knowing for certain\" before starting back to look for MacPherson.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 133</ref> Only when the brigade major \"heaved out his revolver, stuck it in my stomach and said, 'I'll shoot you if you don't go back. I was with him when he was killed'\" did Calvert resume the retreat.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 134</ref>

====Mogaung====
{{Further|Battle of Mogaung}}
[[File:The Chindits MH7287.jpg|thumb|right|Calvert (left) giving orders during the capture of Mogaung in June 1944.]]
In May, the Chindit brigades moved north. The [[monsoon]] had broken and floods impeded the Chindits' operations. On 27 May, Major General [[Walter Lentaigne]] (who had taken command of the Chindits after Wingate was killed in an air crash in late March) ordered Calvert's brigade to capture the town of [[Mogaung]].<ref>Allen, p.369</ref> Calvert at first promised to capture Mogaung by 5 June. However, the Japanese reinforced the defenders of the town until it was held by a force of four battalions from the 53rd Division.<ref>Allen (1984), p.371</ref> As Calvert's brigade tried to advance over flooded flat ground, they suffered severely from shortage of rations, exhaustion and disease. Finally, Calvert was reinforced by a Chinese battalion and put in an all-out assault on 24 June which captured almost all of the town.<ref>Allen, p.373-374</ref> The last resistance was cleared by 27 June. Calvert's brigade had suffered 800 battle casualties in the siege, half of its strength. Of the remainder, only 300 men were left fit to fight.

The American General [[Joseph Stilwell]], who had overall command of the Chindits, announced via the [[BBC]] that the Chinese troops of his [[Northern Combat Area Command]] had captured Mogaung. Calvert signalled to Stilwell's headquarters \"Chinese reported taking Mogaung. My Brigade now taking umbrage.\"<ref>Allen, p.374</ref>

When he received orders to move to [[Myitkyina]], where another Japanese garrison was holding out, Calvert closed down his brigade's radio sets and marched to Stilwell's headquarters in [[Kamaing]] instead. A court martial was threatened, but after he and Stilwell finally met in person and Stilwell appreciated for the first time the conditions under which the Chindits had operated, the 77th Brigade was evacuated to India to recover. Calvert was awarded a bar to the DSO for the second Chindit expedition. In the field Calvert was \"clearly the most successful and aggressive Chindit commander,\" and a font of \"positive leadership\" throughout the campaign.<ref>Rooney (1995), p.127</ref>

===SAS Operations===
[[File:3rd 4th sas tarbes 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Calvert at the ceremony marking the passing of 3 and 4 SAS to France in October 1945.]]
Calvert was evacuated to Britain on medical grounds (ironically following an accidental injury) in September 1944. In March 1945 he was appointed to command the [[Special Air Service]] Brigade organising [[Operation Amherst]]. He held this appointment until the brigade disbanded in October 1945.

After the war, he attended the Army's [[Staff College]]. After passing the course, he was appointed to a staff post as lieutenant colonel in the Allied Military Government in [[Trieste]]. He was then selected in 1950 to command the [[Malayan Scouts]] engaged in operations against Communist insurgents in the [[Malayan Emergency]]. Although he held the local rank of [[brigadier]], he nevertheless led several patrols and operations in person. However, the Malayan Scouts were not subject to proper selection procedures and never lost an early reputation for poor discipline. Calvert's exertions meant that he was invalided home in 1951.

===Dismissal from the Army===
On his return to the UK, Calvert reverted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1951 he was assigned to a minor administrative staff post with the [[British Army of the Rhine]]. While there in 1952 he was accused of an act of sexual indecency with German civilian youths, [[court-martial]]led, found guilty and dismissed from the British Army.<ref>'The Shaming of a Hero', 'The Independent', 4 May 1999. https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-shaming-of-a-hero-1091460.html</ref>

==Later life==
After the military Calvert tried several times tried to build a career as an engineer, including a spell making a new start in Australia, but his life in this period was plagued by [[alcoholism]], and he resorted to hand-to-mouth manual itinerant work, and for a while he was a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] there. He later returned to England.<ref>'The Shaming of a Hero', 'The Independent', 4 May 1999</ref>

He wrote three books about his time in Burma with Wingate and the Chindits: ''Prisoners of Hope'', ''Fighting Mad: One Man's Guerrilla War'', and ''Chindits: Long Range Penetration''. He also contributed to the acclaimed British documentary television series, ''[[The World at War (TV series)|The World at War]].'' He is interviewed in the fourteenth episode, \"It's a Lovely Day Tomorrow – Burma (1942–1944)\". He also appeared on film in the 2001 documentary series ''Gladiators of World War II'' episode 11, entitled \"The Chindits\".  Subsequently, he was appointed research fellow at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] in 1971 to write \"The Pattern of Guerrilla Warfare\", which was never finished.

With little money in his final years, he was compelled to sell his military medals and decorations in 1997.<ref>'The Shaming of a Hero', 'The Independent', 4 May 1999.</ref>

==Death==
Calvert died in his 86th year on 26 November 1998 in [[Richmond-upon-Thames]]. Up until his death he was a supporter of The Chindits Old Comrades Association and other charities for the support of ex-servicemen. His body was cremated at the Chilterns Crematorium in [[Amersham]], in the county of [[Buckinghamshire]].<ref>Entry for Calvert in 'Findagrave'. http://www.findagrave.com/memorial/57324141</ref>

'''James Michael Calvert''' (6 March 1913 – 26 November 1998) was a British soldier involved in [[special operations]] in [[Burma]] during the [[Second World War]]. He participated in both [[Chindit]] operations and was instrumental in popularizing the unorthodox ideas of [[Orde Wingate|General Orde Wingate]]. He frequently led attacks from the front, a practice that earned him the nickname amongst the men under his command of \"Mad Mike.\"

==Early life==
Calvert was born at [[Rohtak]] in [[British India|India]], son of a member of the [[Indian Civil Service]]. He was educated at [[Bradfield College]] and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], from which was commissioned as a [[subaltern]] into the British Army's [[Royal Engineers]] as a professional soldier.<ref>Obituary for Calvert. 'The Independent', 2 December 1998.</ref>

==Military career==
Calvert was commissioned into the [[Royal Engineers]] in 1933, and for a time was the Army's [[middleweight]] boxing champion. He spent a year reading for the Mechanical Engineering [[Tripos]] at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St. John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].<ref>Obituary for Calvert, 'The Independent', 2 December 1998. https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-brigadier-michael-calvert-1188603.html</ref> In 1934 he returned to active service and was posted to the [[Hong Kong]] Royal Engineers, where he learned to speak [[Cantonese]]. He also witnessed the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese Army's]] attack on [[Shanghai]] and the [[Rape of Nanking]], which made him one of the few officers in the British Army pre-World War 2 who fully appreciated the nature of the threat posed by Japanese imperialism.

When the [[Second World War]] broke out in 1939 Calvert briefly commanded a detachment of Royal Engineers in the [[Norwegian Campaign]], then trained [[commando]] detachments in [[demolition]] techniques in Hong Kong and Australia. In Australia, along with [[F. Spencer Chapman]], he assisted with training Australian commandos who formed the first [[Australian Army Independent Companies]] at [[Wilsons Promontory]], Victoria in 1941. He was then appointed to command the '''Bush Warfare School''' in [[Burma]], training officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s to lead guerilla bands in China for operations against the Japanese.

The Japanese invaded Burma in early 1942. Calvert and others from the school raided [[Henzada]] by riverboat after the fall of [[Rangoon]] as a deception operation to convince the Japanese that Australian reinforcements had reached Burma. Calvert then spent a period of time touring Burma with [[Orde Wingate]]. After the Bush Warfare School closed, Calvert was sent with 22 men from the school and a few hundred men separated from their units to guard the Gokteik Viaduct thirty miles east of [[Maymyo]]. (The Allied Commander in Chief, General [[Archibald Wavell]] apparently hoped that Calvert would use his initiative and demolish it, in spite of orders from the civil government to keep it intact. For once, Calvert obeyed orders.)<ref>Allen (1984), p.136</ref>

After retreating from the viaduct, Calvert participated in a deception operation involving the loss of a set of false papers to the Japanese. Calvert's unit finally retreated to India at the very rear of the army, often behind the Japanese lines.

===Operation Longcloth===
In India, he reunited with the equally unorthodox Wingate, and the two became firm friends. Calvert led one of the company-sized columns in [[Operation Longcloth]], Wingate's first [[Chindit]] operation in 1943. This was a long-range penetration operation behind enemy lines, which put great demands on the endurance of all who took part. Calvert was awarded the DSO for his achievements on the operation. His column achieved the greatest amount of demolition of the Japanese lines of communication, and reached India intact with the fewest casualties of those in the force.<ref>Allen (1984), pp.128-143</ref>

===Operation Thursday===
====The Fly-In====
Calvert commanded the [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade]] in [[Operation Thursday]], the much larger second Chindit operation. His brigade spearheaded the airborne landings deep in the Japanese rear. The operation was staged from Lalaghat, with D-Day fixed for 5 March. That morning, one of General [[Philip Cochran]]'s [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchells]] flew over and photographed the landing zones. Wingate had ordered that no aircraft should fly over the landing zones, lest the operation be betrayed, but Cochran was not directly under Wingate's command and felt that launching the operation without accurate intelligence was a dangerous gamble.<ref>Bidwell, 1979: 104–5</ref> The photographs clearly showed that one of landing sites selected, codenamed Piccadilly, was unusable.

<blockquote>It was at this dramatic moment, with everyone keyed up and ready to go, that the aerial photographs arrived. They showed that primary landing site Broadway was clear, but Piccadilly had been blocked by tree trunks; no gliders would land there that night. The general opinion was that the Japs had realized the possibilities of Piccadilly as a landing area and had deliberately blocked it, though some time later we discovered that the explanation was much simpler: Burmese woodmen had laid out their trees to dry in the clearing.<ref>Calvert, 1964: 140</ref></blockquote>

Wingate was enraged by Cochran's actions but admitted that the danger was real. He and Calvert weighed the options. The danger of executing a potentially compromised operation were substantial, but any delay threatened to push back the window of opportunity by at least a month. Of the three planned sites only two were available; Calvert suggested the plan be further altered and the entire brigade flown into Broadway. He said, \"I am prepared to take the whole of my brigade into Broadway and do without [second landing site] Piccadilly.\"<ref>Bidwell, 1979: 106</ref> Calvert later wrote, \"We had taken into account that [third landing site] Chowringhee was to the east of the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]] while Broadway was west of the river. I told Wingate, 'I don't want to split my brigade either side of the Irrawaddy. I am prepared to take all the brigade into Broadway alone and take the consequence of a slower build-up.'\"<ref>Calvert, 1964: 141</ref> Lieutenant General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]] \"asked Calvert…and found him strongly against [using] Chowringhee.\"<ref>Slim, 1957: 259</ref> Further discussion with Slim and Wingate clinched the matter: \"it was to be Broadway alone. I was nervous as bales, I imagine we all were, but we all knew we had to go…In any case Broadway was clear and I could really see no reason why we should not go in there just because Piccadilly was blocked.\"<ref>Calvert, 1964: 141</ref>

Each American [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] towed two heavily laden [[Waco CG-4]] gliders. Although a double tow posed no problems for a competent pilot in good weather, many of the pilots were inexperienced and the route across the mountain ranges bordering the [[Chindwin river]] guaranteed a turbulent, unsettled flight. The first gliders were scheduled to arrive at Broadway by 9:30pm, but by 2:00am Wingate and the others waiting at Lalaghat had not yet heard from Calvert. Poor reconnaissance, not enemy resistance, caused the delay, as aerial reconnaissance had failed to show a number of ditches scarring the field at Broadway. Calvert wrote:

<blockquote>All six of the advance party gliders had landed and the plan had been that we would wheel them off to make way for the next batch, which would in turn be wheeled away and so on. But we had reckoned without the ditches. Three of the six gliders were so badly wrecked that the small force at present on the ground could not shift them. We worked at them furiously but suddenly I heard a shout and looked up. In the bright light of the moon I saw to my horror that the first two of the next batch had cast off [their tows] and were winging their silent way down.<ref>Calvert, 1964: 143</ref></blockquote>

Calvert transmitted the prearranged signal \"Soya Link\", the most despised of ration items, to stop all flying, but at 6:30am on 6 March he radioed the code words \"Pork Sausage\" to resume flights into Broadway. A strip for C-47s was in place that evening, and supplies came rushing in. Calvert lost no time in organizing reconnaissance missions and fortifying Broadway. By 13 March the build-up was complete. In seven nights about 9,000 men, 1,350 animals, 250 tons of supplies and weapons had landed behind enemy lines in Burma.<ref>Calvert, 1964: 148</ref>

====Broadway====
On 17 March he led a [[bayonet]] charge against Japanese positions shielded by a sunken road and a steep hill crowned with a pagoda. Calvert noticed that friendly forces nearby were drawing heavier fire. In fact, elements of the South Staffordshire Regiment had dug in adjacent to a Japanese unit. Neither force was aware of the other.<ref>Bidwell, 1979: 199</ref> Deciding that something had to be done, he elected to make a frontal assault:

<blockquote>I saw something had to be done pretty quickly, so I shouted to Freddie that we were going to charge. I then told everyone that we were going to charge the Pagoda Hill. There were reinforcements on our left flank who would charge as well. So, standing up, I shouted out 'Charge' in the approved Victorian manner, and ran down the hill…Half of the [[South Staffordshire Regiment|South Staffords]] joined in. Then looking back I found a lot had not. So I told them to bloody well 'Charge, what the hell do you think you're doing.' So they charged. Machine-gunners, mortar teams, all officers – everybody who was on that hill<ref>Calvert, 1952:50</ref></blockquote>

The fighting quickly degenerated into a free-for-all. Calvert characterized the action as an \"extraordinary mêlée…everyone shooting, bayoneting, kicking at everyone else, rather like an officers' guest night.\"<ref>Calvert, 1952: 50</ref> [[George Albert Cairns|Lieutenant George Cairns]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for killing several Japanese after one severed his left arm with a sword. A pause in the fighting turned into a stalemate, complete with shouting – according to Calvert \"[t]he Japs were yelling at us in English, 'You dirty hairy bastards,' etc.; only a final charge made by Calvert and some [[Gurkha]]s dislodged the Japanese. Many of these were shot as they retreated.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 51</ref> Afterward, \"the hill was a horrid sight, littered with Jap dead, and already the ones who had been killed there earlier in the day were black with flies. Stretcher-bearers were removing our wounded and our mercifully very few dead.\"<ref>Norman Durant quoted in Bidwell, 1979: 122</ref>

Shortly after this action a lieutenant in the South Staffordshire Regiment, Norman Durant, wrote a compelling description of Calvert in a letter to his parents:

<blockquote>His hair flops over his forehead, and he has a disconcerting habit of staring at you when you speak to him and yet not appearing to hear a word. His lectures were always painfully slow and hesitant and during training he gave the impression of taking a long time to make up his mind; in action things were very different. He knows all the officers in the brigade and many of the senior NCOs, and his manner and attitude are always the same if he is talking to a CO, a subaltern or a private…<ref>Norman Durant quoted in Bidwell, 1979: 118–19</ref></blockquote>

Calvert's dedication to the troops under his command was one of his most visible attributes. According to David Rooney he was \"one of the most successful of the Chindit leaders [and] showed his greatness as a commander by reminding his men that, however bad things were for them, things were probably much worse for the enemy.\"<ref>Rooney, 1995: 98</ref>

====White City====
The brigade then captured and held a position near Mawlu. Calvert \"saw that Mawlu [the location of the block] was the crucial point for road and rail traffic and determined to build up a defensive box there.\"<ref>Rooney, 1995: 126</ref> Because of the supply drop parachutes adorning the surrounding jungle, it became known as the White City. This fortified position blocked Japanese road and rail communications to their northern front for over two months. A large rectangle, 1,000 by 800 yards, White City was quickly identified by the Japanese as a threat. Probing attacks on 18, 19, and 20 March inflicted a handful of casualties, but were beaten back without significant loss. The Japanese mounted a serious attack on the night of 21 March that resulted in \"[v]ery confused close-quarter fighting\" that lasted all night. Two Japanese light machine guns were established in the block; a dawn attack led by flamethrower-equipped infantry displaced the Japanese, driving them outside the perimeter. Calvert was instrumental in orchestrating the counterattacks and was frequently under fire.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 52–57</ref>

After repulsing numerous nighttime attacks, Calvert had two relatively quiet weeks to fortify White City. Under his direction a thick hedge of barbed wire was put in place and surrounded with mines and booby traps. Firing positions were dug in and camouflaged; reinforced with logs and earth, these positions were invisible and all-but impenetrable. Calvert also established a defensive fire plan to coordinate machine gun and mortar fire. Some [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder|2-pounder anti-tank guns]] arrived on 29 March and were quickly put in place. These were followed by engineers who built a landing strip capable of handling [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] cargo aircraft, which delivered more artillery. White City was eventually defended by four anti-tank guns, six [[Bofors 40 mm]] [[autocannon]]s and four [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25-pounders]].<ref>Bidwell, 1979: 125</ref> Calvert had a not insubstantial arsenal at his disposal.

On 6 April the White City again came under attack. The Japanese shelled and bombed the block throughout the afternoon. Calvert recalled that the terrain combined with meticulous attention to detail in constructing the positions provided shelter, and that casualties were low.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 109–10</ref> The only effective weapon the Japanese possessed was a 6-inch [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], an old coastal defence piece they had laboriously dragged through the jungle to bombard the block. The mortar fired a bomb four and a half feet long that was in flight for more than 30 seconds.<ref>Allen, 1998: 353</ref> Calvert described the mortar as \"the bane of our existence.\"<ref>Calvert, 1952: 109</ref> Calvert spent the attack in a dugout, coordinating his troops' response via telephone. He reported that stiff resistance led by his friend Ian MacPherson prevented the Japanese from breaching the block.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 110–11</ref>

From 6 April through 11 April, Calvert wrote, \"[t]he sequence of attack was the same practically every night and only varied in intensity.\" Japanese infantry attacked after dark, invariably running into stiff resistance from emplaced machine guns, mines, barbed wire, booby traps, artillery, and sustained rifle fire.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 112</ref> The Japanese brought forward two light tanks; these were quickly destroyed with 2-pounder anti-tank guns. Confident in the block's ability to withstand any attack, Calvert's only concern was his rapidly dwindling supply of ammunition. Machine gun ammunition was being used at a frantic pace. In all, some 700,000 rounds of [[Vickers machine gun]] ammunition were dropped into White City. Calvert requested that supply drops contain less food and more ammunition.<ref>Allen, 1998: 353</ref>

Calvert led several counter-attacks against encircling Japanese forces in person. On 13 April he commanded a much larger attack involving most of the brigade. Despite the intervention of American [[P-51 Mustang]]s, the attack was a failure; Calvert was forced to order a retreat. He learned that Major Ian MacPherson, commander of the headquarters company of the 77th Brigade had been killed, his body left in the Japanese positions. Calvert said he \"could not leave anyone like that without knowing for certain\" before starting back to look for MacPherson.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 133</ref> Only when the brigade major \"heaved out his revolver, stuck it in my stomach and said, 'I'll shoot you if you don't go back. I was with him when he was killed'\" did Calvert resume the retreat.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 134</ref>

====Mogaung====
[[File:The Chindits MH7287.jpg|thumb|right|Calvert (left) giving orders during the capture of Mogaung in June 1944.]]
In May, the Chindit brigades moved north. The [[monsoon]] had broken and floods impeded the Chindits' operations. On 27 May, Major General [[Walter Lentaigne]] (who had taken command of the Chindits after Wingate was killed in an air crash in late March) ordered Calvert's brigade to capture the town of [[Mogaung]].<ref>Allen, p.369</ref> Calvert at first promised to capture Mogaung by 5 June. However, the Japanese reinforced the defenders of the town until it was held by a force of four battalions from the 53rd Division.<ref>Allen (1984), p.371</ref> As Calvert's brigade tried to advance over flooded flat ground, they suffered severely from shortage of rations, exhaustion and disease. Finally, Calvert was reinforced by a Chinese battalion and put in an all-out assault on 24 June which captured almost all of the town.<ref>Allen, p.373-374</ref> The last resistance was cleared by 27 June. Calvert's brigade had suffered 800 battle casualties in the siege, half of its strength. Of the remainder, only 300 men were left fit to fight.

The American General [[Joseph Stilwell]], who had overall command of the Chindits, announced via the [[BBC]] that the Chinese troops of his [[Northern Combat Area Command]] had captured Mogaung. Calvert signalled to Stilwell's headquarters \"Chinese reported taking Mogaung. My Brigade now taking umbrage.\"<ref>Allen, p.374</ref>

When he received orders to move to [[Myitkyina]], where another Japanese garrison was holding out, Calvert closed down his brigade's radio sets and marched to Stilwell's headquarters in [[Kamaing]] instead. A court martial was threatened, but after he and Stilwell finally met in person and Stilwell appreciated for the first time the conditions under which the Chindits had operated, the 77th Brigade was evacuated to India to recover. Calvert was awarded a bar to the DSO for the second Chindit expedition. In the field Calvert was \"clearly the most successful and aggressive Chindit commander,\" and a font of \"positive leadership\" throughout the campaign.<ref>Rooney (1995), p.127</ref>

===SAS Operations===
[[File:3rd 4th sas tarbes 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Calvert at the ceremony marking the passing of 3 and 4 SAS to France in October 1945.]]
Calvert was evacuated to Britain on medical grounds (ironically following an accidental injury) in September 1944. In March 1945 he was appointed to command the [[Special Air Service]] Brigade organising [[Operation Amherst]]. He held this appointment until the brigade disbanded in October 1945.

After the war, he attended the Army's [[Staff College]]. After passing the course, he was appointed to a staff post as lieutenant colonel in the Allied Military Government in [[Trieste]]. He was then selected in 1950 to command the [[Malayan Scouts]] engaged in operations against Communist insurgents in the [[Malayan Emergency]]. Although he held the local rank of [[brigadier]], he nevertheless led several patrols and operations in person. However, the Malayan Scouts were not subject to proper selection procedures and never lost an early reputation for poor discipline. Calvert's exertions meant that he was invalided home in 1951.

===Dismissal from the Army===
On his return to the UK, Calvert reverted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1951 he was assigned to a minor administrative staff post with the [[British Army of the Rhine]]. While there in 1952 he was accused of an act of sexual indecency with German civilian youths, [[court-martial]]led, found guilty and dismissed from the British Army.<ref>'The Shaming of a Hero', 'The Independent', 4 May 1999. https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-shaming-of-a-hero-1091460.html</ref>

==Later life==
After the military Calvert tried several times tried to build a career as an engineer, including a spell making a new start in Australia, but his life in this period was plagued by [[alcoholism]], and he resorted to hand-to-mouth manual itinerant work, and for a while he was a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] there. He later returned to England.<ref>'The Shaming of a Hero', 'The Independent', 4 May 1999</ref>

He wrote three books about his time in Burma with Wingate and the Chindits: ''Prisoners of Hope'', ''Fighting Mad: One Man's Guerrilla War'', and ''Chindits: Long Range Penetration''. He also contributed to the acclaimed British documentary television series, ''[[The World at War (TV series)|The World at War]].'' He is interviewed in the fourteenth episode, \"It's a Lovely Day Tomorrow – Burma (1942–1944)\". He also appeared on film in the 2001 documentary series ''Gladiators of World War II'' episode 11, entitled \"The Chindits\".  Subsequently, he was appointed research fellow at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] in 1971 to write \"The Pattern of Guerrilla Warfare\", which was never finished.

With little money in his final years, he was compelled to sell his military medals and decorations in 1997.<ref>'The Shaming of a Hero', 'The Independent', 4 May 1999.</ref>

==Death==
Calvert died in his 86th year on 26 November 1998 in [[Richmond-upon-Thames]]. Up until his death he was a supporter of The Chindits Old Comrades Association and other charities for the support of ex-servicemen. His body was cremated at the Chilterns Crematorium in [[Amersham]], in the county of [[Buckinghamshire]].<ref>Entry for Calvert in 'Findagrave'. http://www.findagrave.com/memorial/57324141</ref>

This page documents notable [[tornado]]es and [[tornado outbreak]]s worldwide in '''2020'''. Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the [[United States]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[East India|Eastern India]], but can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern [[Canada]] during the [[Northern Hemisphere]]'s summer and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Argentina]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Tornadic events are often accompanied by other forms of [[severe weather]], including strong [[thunderstorm]]s, strong [[winds]], and [[hail]].

There have been 245 preliminary filtered reports of tornadoes in the United States in 2020,<ref>{{cite web |title=Annual Severe Weather Report Summary 2020 |url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/monthly/2020_annual_summary.html |publisher=Storm Prediction Center |accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref> of which 209 have been confirmed.

'''Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt''' (Sallie M. Bryan; August 11, 1836 – December 22, 1919) was an American poet.  Her publishing career began in the mid-1850s and lasted into the twentieth century.  She published hundreds of poems in widely-circulating newspapers, magazines, and anthologies as well as in eighteen volumes of poems, two of which she co-authored with her husband, the poet John James Piatt (also known as “J.J.”).<ref>Paula Bernat Bennett, ed., ''Palace-Burner: The Selected Poetry of Sarah Piatt'' (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2001), xvii-xviii; xxiv-xxv; “Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt (1836-1919),” Faith Barrett and Christanne Miller, eds., ''“Words for the Hour”: A New Anthology of American Civil War Poetry'' (Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 2005), 331; Karen L.

==Early years and education==
Sarah Morgan Bryan was born near [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], [[Kentucky]], August 11, 1836.{{sfn|Stevenson|1922|p=3893}}<ref>Michaels 1999, p. 9.</ref> Her parents, Talbot Nelson Bryan and Mary Spiers Bryan, both descended from slaveholding families. Her mother was related to the Stocktons, Simpsons and other early Kentucky settlers.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=840}}{{sfn|Lauter|Alberti|Yarborough|2009|p=741}} Her paternal grandfather, Morgan Bryan, was one of the pioneer settlers of that state, a proprietor of \"Bryan's Station,\" and a brother-in-law of [[Daniel Boone]], whom the Bryans accompanied from [[North Carolina]] into Kentucky.{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=183}}{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=840}}

When she was three, the family{{sfn|Haralson|2014|p=328}} moved near [[Versailles, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Townsend|Townsend|1913|p=303}}<ref>Michaels 1999, p. 9-10.</ref> Her mother died a few years later, when Piatt was eight years old. The loss had a profound impact on her life and outlook, as evident in her poetry.{{sfn|Radcliffe College|1971|p=63}}{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}} She then lived on various Kentucky plantations with relatives, accompanied by her mother's nurse, an African American slave.{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} For a time, she lived with her grandmother, and then later went to live with her father at the home of his new wife.{{sfn|Haralson|2014|p=328}} Eventually, Piatt's father placed her and a younger sister in the care of their aunt, Mrs. Annie Boone, who lived in [[New Castle, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}

In New Castle, Piatt attended Henry Female College, graduating in 1854.<ref>Bennett, Introduction, 2001, p. xxiii</ref>{{sfn|Ridpath|1906|p=289}} She became an avid reader, and was especially fond of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], and [[Lord Byron]], [[Thomas Moore]], [[Walter Scott]], [[Felicia Hemans]], and [[Robert Browning]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}{{sfn|Renker|2016|p=236}} While a student, Piatt began publishing her poetry in the local newspaper.{{sfn|Larson|2011|p=189}}

==Career==
When [[George D. Prentice]], writer, poet, and editor of the ''[[Louisville Journal]],'' encountered Piatt's poetry, he immediately recognized her talent and skill. In 1855 he wrote to her: \"I now say emphatically to you again . . . that, if you are entirely true to yourself, and if your life be spared, you will, in the maturity of your powers, be the first poet of your sex in the United States. I say this not as what I think, but what I know.\"{{sfn|The Magazine of Poetry and Literary Review, Volume 3|1891|p=401}} Prentice became Piatt's mentor and advocate, publishing many of her poems in his newspaper.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}} She also began sending her work to <i>The [[New York Ledger]]</i>, a popular and important periodical with a national circulation.<ref>''The Early Poems of Sarah Morgan Bryan (Piatt) in the New York Ledger, 1857-1860'' Professor Elizabeth Renker, The Ohio State University Knowledge Bank, https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/87056, accessed 27 March 2020''</ref>

On June 18, 1861, she married aspiring poet John James Piatt (also known as \"J.J.\"), whom she had met through Prentice.{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} The couple relocated to [[Washington, D.C.]] where J.J. had accepted a clerk position in the U.S. Treasury.{{sfn|Lauter|Alberti|Yarborough|2009|p=741}} During this period they published a collection featuring both of their poetry, <i>The Nests at Washington</i> (1864). This was J.J.'s second book (following the 1861 <i>Poems by Two Friends</i> with William Dean Howells) and Sarah's first.{{sfn|Ridpath|Ridpath Library of Universal Literature, Volume 18|1899|p=n.p.}}

In July 1867, they moved to [[Ohio]], where J.J. worked for [[Cincinnati]] newspapers. They made their home on a part of the old estate of [[William Henry Harrison]] in [[North Bend, Ohio]], a few miles south of [[Cincinnati]], on the [[Ohio River]]. The family shuttled back and forth to Washington D.C. on a few occasions,{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} such as when J.J. worked for the postal service. From 1870-1876, Piatt and the children joined J.J. in Washington D.C. in the winters where he was serving as librarian of the [[United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|James|James|Boyer|1971|p=64}} During this time, Sarah's poems also appeared in the Washington, D.C. weekly newspaper <i>The Capital</i>, founded by Donn Piatt, her cousin by marriage.<ref>''The Capital, 1871-1880 (Sarah Piatt Recovery Project), The Ohio State University Knowledge Bank, https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/90925, accessed 27 March 2020''</ref>

Her first independent collection of poetry, ''A Woman's Poems'', appeared anonymously in 1871. This came to be her best known work, made famous by Bayard Taylor's book, ''The Echo Club''.{{sfn|Townsend|Townsend|1913|p=303}} The volume was followed several more, including ''A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles'' (1874); ''That New World'' (1876); ''Poems in Company with Children'' (1877); and ''Dramatic Persons and Moods'' (1878). During this period, Piatt also contributed to many prominent American magazines, such as ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'', ''[[The Century Magazine]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', and ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]].''{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}

In 1882, the Piatts moved to Queenstown (now [[Cobh]]) Ireland, as J.J. had accepted the position of [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] of the U.S. to [[Cork (city)|Cork]], a job he held for eleven years.{{sfn|Lauter|Alberti|Yarborough|2009|p=741}} While abroad, Sarah wrote many poems inspired by her time in Ireland. She continued publishing poetry collections, including ''An Irish Garland'' ([[Edinburgh]], 1884), a volume of her ''Selected Poems'' ([[London]], 1885), ''In Primrose Time: a New Irish Garland'' (London, 1886), ''The Witch in the Glass, and Other Poems'' (London, 1889), and ''An Irish Wild-Flower'' (London, 1891), all of which were issued simultaneously in the U.S.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=570}} Sarah and J.J. also published another volume featuring both of their work, ''The Children Out-of-Doors: a Book of Verses'' (Edinburgh, 1884).

==Personal life==

Piatt was the mother of Marian (b 1862); Victor (1864); Donn (1867); Fred (1869); Guy (1871); Louis (1875); and Cecil (1878) as well as at least one infant child and possibly others in infancy or through miscarriage. Victor died in a tragic fireworks accident in 1874, and Louis drowned in a boating accident in 1884 while the Piatts were living in Ireland.{{sfn|Michaels|1999|p=11-12}}

After J.J.'s death in 1917, Piatt removed to her son Cecil's home in [[Caldwell, New Jersey|Caldwell]], [[New Jersey]], where she died of [[pneumonia]] on December 22, 1919.{{sfn|Stevenson|1922|p=3893}}{{sfn|McHenry|1980|p=327}} She and J.J. are buried at Spring Grove Cemetery, [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].{{sfn|James|James|Boyer|1971|p=64}}

==Themes and reception==
Children were a common theme in Piatt's poems.{{sfn|Frank|2007|p=134}}

Her biographer, in [[Richard Henry Stoddard]]'s ''Poets' Homes'', stated:—{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=183}} {{quote|text=\"It is since her marriage, in June, 1861,\" says Mrs.  \"that her more individual characteristics of style have manifested themselves, especially the dramatic element, so delicate, subtle and strong, which asserts her intellectual kinship with Mrs. Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\"}}

Writes [[William Dean Howells]]:—{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}} {{quote|text=\"In the rush of these hopeless tears, this heart-broken scorn of comfort, this unreconcilable patience of grief, is the drama of the race's affliction; in the utter desolation of one woman's sorrow, the universal anguish of mortality is expressed. It is not pessimism; it does not assume to be any sort of philosophy or system; it is simply the bitter truth, to a phrase, of human experience through which all men must pass, and the reader need not be told that such poems were lived before they were written.\"}}

Another admirer of Piatt's verse, in a critical survey of the literature of Ohio, (1903) said of the author and her work:—{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}}{{quote|text=\"Mrs. Piatt is a woman of original and exceptional genius — a poet whose name shines in American literature, 'Like some great jewel full of fire.' She is unrivaled, in her province of song, by any living writer of her sex, whether native to this country or of foreign birth. . . . She is inimitable in her own vivid, bold, and suggestive invention and manner. Whatever she writes has meaning — and the significance is often deep — sometimes strange and elusive — never commonplace. . . . Mrs. Piatt's rare artistic skill has been admired by many who appreciate the technical difficulties of the poetic craft.\"}}

Equally emphatic is the praise accorded by a contemporary English critic, who, in an article contributed to the ''[[Saturday Review (London newspaper)|London Saturday Review]]'', commenting on the volume of select verse entitled ''A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles, and Other Poems,'' said:—{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}}  {{quote|text=\"Of all the concourse of women singers Mrs. Piatt is the most racy and, in a word, the most American. . . . The new selections of her poems should be most welcome to all who seek in American poetry something more than a pale reflex of the British commodity. . . . Her poems, with all their whim and inconstancy of mood, are charmingly sincere, artless, piquant, and full of quaint surprise.\"}}

In like commendatory strain, another English critic, reviewing the same book in the ''Pictorial World'' (London), pronounced her verse, \"not easy to equal, much less to surpass, on either side of the Atlantic,\" and characterized her poetical achievement in the following words:—{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=185}} {{quote|text=\"Mrs. Piatt studies no model, and takes no pattern for her work; she simply expresses herself; hence her verse is just the transparent mantle of her individuality. The natural refinement, the ready sympathy, the tender sentiment, the quiet grace of a thoroughly womanly woman reveal themselves quite unconsciously in every poem; and the musical quality of the verse increases the impression that the reader is listening to the heartutterances of one of the Imogens or Mirandas to be met with now seldom outside the radiant land where Shakespeare's imagination reigns supreme. . . . Mrs. Piatt will, we doubt not, as her poems become known to English readers, become popular, or, we should rather say, dear to a wide circle mainly composed of members of her own sex, for she supplies the adequate expression for women whose hearts are tender and true like her own.\"}}

'''Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt''' (Sallie M. Bryan; August 11, 1836 – December 22, 1919) was an American poet.  Her publishing career began in the mid-1850s and lasted into the twentieth century.  She published hundreds of poems in widely-circulating newspapers, magazines, and anthologies as well as in eighteen volumes of poems, two of which she co-authored with her husband, the poet John James Piatt (also known as “J.J.”).<ref>Paula Bernat Bennett, ed., ''Palace-Burner: The Selected Poetry of Sarah Piatt'' (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2001), xvii-xviii; xxiv-xxv; “Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt (1836-1919),” Faith Barrett and Christanne Miller, eds., ''“Words for the Hour”: A New Anthology of American Civil War Poetry'' (Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 2005), 331; Karen L.

==Early years and education==
Sarah Morgan Bryan was born near [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], [[Kentucky]], August 11, 1836.{{sfn|Stevenson|1922|p=3893}}<ref>Michaels 1999, p. 9.</ref> Her parents, Talbot Nelson Bryan and Mary Spiers Bryan, both descended from slaveholding families. Her mother was related to the Stocktons, Simpsons and other early Kentucky settlers.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=840}}{{sfn|Lauter|Alberti|Yarborough|2009|p=741}} Her paternal grandfather, Morgan Bryan, was one of the pioneer settlers of that state, a proprietor of \"Bryan's Station,\" and a brother-in-law of [[Daniel Boone]], whom the Bryans accompanied from [[North Carolina]] into Kentucky.{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=183}}{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=840}}

When she was three, the family{{sfn|Haralson|2014|p=328}} moved near [[Versailles, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Townsend|Townsend|1913|p=303}}<ref>Michaels 1999, p. 9-10.</ref> Her mother died a few years later, when Piatt was eight years old. The loss had a profound impact on her life and outlook, as evident in her poetry. {{sfn|Radcliffe College|1971|p=63}}{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}
She then lived on various Kentucky plantations with relatives, accompanied by her mother's nurse, an African American slave.{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} For a time, she lived with her grandmother, and then later went to live with her father at the home of his new wife.{{sfn|Haralson|2014|p=328}} Eventually, Piatt's father placed her and a younger sister in the care of their aunt, Mrs. Annie Boone, who lived in [[New Castle, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}

In New Castle, Piatt attended Henry Female College, graduating in 1854.<ref>Bennett, Introduction, 2001, p. xxiii</ref>{{sfn|Ridpath|1906|p=289}} She became an avid reader, and was especially fond of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], and [[Lord Byron]], [[Thomas Moore]], [[Walter Scott]], [[Felicia Hemans]], and [[Robert Browning]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}{{sfn|Renker|2016|p=236}} While a student, Piatt began publishing her poetry in the local newspaper.{{sfn|Larson|2011|p=189}}

==Career==
When [[George D. Prentice]], writer, poet, and editor of the ''[[Louisville Journal]],'' encountered Piatt's poetry, he immediately recognized her talent and skill. In 1855 he wrote to her: \"I now say emphatically to you again . . . that, if you are entirely true to yourself, and if your life be spared, you will, in the maturity of your powers, be the first poet of your sex in the United States. I say this not as what I think, but what I know.\"{{sfn|The Magazine of Poetry and Literary Review, Volume 3|1891|p=401}} Prentice became Piatt's mentor and advocate, publishing many of her poems in his newspaper.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}} She also began sending her work to <i>The [[New York Ledger]]</i>, a popular and important periodical with a national circulation.<ref>''The Early Poems of Sarah Morgan Bryan (Piatt) in the New York Ledger, 1857-1860'' Professor Elizabeth Renker, The Ohio State University Knowledge Bank, https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/87056, accessed 27 March 2020''</ref>

On June 18, 1861, she married aspiring poet John James Piatt (also known as \"J.J.\"), whom she had met through Prentice.{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} The couple relocated to [[Washington, D.C.]] where J.J. had accepted a clerk position in the U.S. Treasury.{{sfn|Lauter|Alberti|Yarborough|2009|p=741}} During this period they published a collection featuring both of their poetry, <i>The Nests at Washington</i> (1864). This was J.J.'s second book (following the 1861 <i>Poems by Two Friends</i> with William Dean Howells) and Sarah's first.{{sfn|Ridpath|Ridpath Library of Universal Literature, Volume 18|1899|p=n.p.}}

In July 1867, they moved to [[Ohio]], where J.J. worked for [[Cincinnati]] newspapers. They made their home on a part of the old estate of [[William Henry Harrison]] in [[North Bend, Ohio]], a few miles south of [[Cincinnati]], on the [[Ohio River]]. The family shuttled back and forth to Washington D.C. on a few occasions,{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} such as when J.J. worked for the postal service. From 1870-1876, Piatt and the children joined J.J. in Washington D.C. in the winters where he was serving as librarian of the [[United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|James|James|Boyer|1971|p=64}} During this time, Sarah's poems also appeared in the Washington, D.C. weekly newspaper <i>The Capital</i>, founded by Donn Piatt, her cousin by marriage.<ref>''The Capital, 1871-1880 (Sarah Piatt Recovery Project), The Ohio State University Knowledge Bank, https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/90925, accessed 27 March 2020''</ref>

Her first independent collection of poetry, ''A Woman's Poems'', appeared anonymously in 1871. This came to be her best known work, made famous by Bayard Taylor's book, ''The Echo Club''.{{sfn|Townsend|Townsend|1913|p=303}} The volume was followed several more, including ''A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles'' (1874); ''That New World'' (1876); ''Poems in Company with Children'' (1877); and ''Dramatic Persons and Moods'' (1878). During this period, Piatt also contributed to many prominent American magazines, such as ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'', ''[[The Century Magazine]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', and ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]].''{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}

In 1882, the Piatts moved to Queenstown (now [[Cobh]]) Ireland, as J.J. had accepted the position of [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] of the U.S. to [[Cork (city)|Cork]], a job he held for eleven years.{{sfn|Lauter|Alberti|Yarborough|2009|p=741}} While abroad, Sarah wrote many poems inspired by her time in Ireland. She continued publishing poetry collections, including ''An Irish Garland'' ([[Edinburgh]], 1884), a volume of her ''Selected Poems'' ([[London]], 1885), ''In Primrose Time: a New Irish Garland'' (London, 1886), ''The Witch in the Glass, and Other Poems'' (London, 1889), and ''An Irish Wild-Flower'' (London, 1891), all of which were issued simultaneously in the U.S. {{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=570}} Sarah and J.J. also published another volume featuring both of their work, ''The Children Out-of-Doors: a Book of Verses'' (Edinburgh, 1884).

==Personal life==

Piatt was the mother of Marian (b 1862); Victor (1864); Donn (1867); Fred (1869); Guy (1871); Louis (1875); and Cecil (1878) as well as at least one infant child and possibly others in infancy or through miscarriage. Victor died in a tragic fireworks accident in 1874, and Louis drowned in a boating accident in 1884 while the Piatts were living in Ireland.  {{sfn|Michaels|1999|p=11-12}}

After J.J.'s death in 1917, Piatt removed to her son Cecil's home in [[Caldwell, New Jersey|Caldwell]], [[New Jersey]], where she died of [[pneumonia]] on December 22, 1919.{{sfn|Stevenson|1922|p=3893}}{{sfn|McHenry|1980|p=327}} She and J.J. are buried at Spring Grove Cemetery, [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].{{sfn|James|James|Boyer|1971|p=64}}

==Themes and reception==
Children were a common theme in Piatt's poems.{{sfn|Frank|2007|p=134}}

Her biographer, in [[Richard Henry Stoddard]]'s ''Poets' Homes'', stated:—{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=183}} {{quote|text=\"It is since her marriage, in June, 1861,\" says Mrs.  \"that her more individual characteristics of style have manifested themselves, especially the dramatic element, so delicate, subtle and strong, which asserts her intellectual kinship with Mrs. Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\"}}

Writes [[William Dean Howells]]:—{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}} {{quote|text=\"In the rush of these hopeless tears, this heart-broken scorn of comfort, this unreconcilable patience of grief, is the drama of the race's affliction; in the utter desolation of one woman's sorrow, the universal anguish of mortality is expressed. It is not pessimism; it does not assume to be any sort of philosophy or system; it is simply the bitter truth, to a phrase, of human experience through which all men must pass, and the reader need not be told that such poems were lived before they were written.\"}}

Another admirer of Piatt's verse, in a critical survey of the literature of Ohio, (1903) said of the author and her work:—{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}}{{quote|text=\"Mrs. Piatt is a woman of original and exceptional genius — a poet whose name shines in American literature, 'Like some great jewel full of fire.' She is unrivaled, in her province of song, by any living writer of her sex, whether native to this country or of foreign birth. . . . She is inimitable in her own vivid, bold, and suggestive invention and manner. Whatever she writes has meaning — and the significance is often deep — sometimes strange and elusive — never commonplace. . . . Mrs. Piatt's rare artistic skill has been admired by many who appreciate the technical difficulties of the poetic craft.\"}}

Equally emphatic is the praise accorded by a contemporary English critic, who, in an article contributed to the ''[[Saturday Review (London newspaper)|London Saturday Review]]'', commenting on the volume of select verse entitled ''A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles, and Other Poems,'' said:—{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}}  {{quote|text=\"Of all the concourse of women singers Mrs. Piatt is the most racy and, in a word, the most American. . . . The new selections of her poems should be most welcome to all who seek in American poetry something more than a pale reflex of the British commodity. . . . Her poems, with all their whim and inconstancy of mood, are charmingly sincere, artless, piquant, and full of quaint surprise.\"}}

In like commendatory strain, another English critic, reviewing the same book in the ''Pictorial World'' (London), pronounced her verse, \"not easy to equal, much less to surpass, on either side of the Atlantic,\" and characterized her poetical achievement in the following words:—{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=185}} {{quote|text=\"Mrs. Piatt studies no model, and takes no pattern for her work; she simply expresses herself; hence her verse is just the transparent mantle of her individuality. The natural refinement, the ready sympathy, the tender sentiment, the quiet grace of a thoroughly womanly woman reveal themselves quite unconsciously in every poem; and the musical quality of the verse increases the impression that the reader is listening to the heartutterances of one of the Imogens or Mirandas to be met with now seldom outside the radiant land where Shakespeare's imagination reigns supreme. . . . Mrs. Piatt will, we doubt not, as her poems become known to English readers, become popular, or, we should rather say, dear to a wide circle mainly composed of members of her own sex, for she supplies the adequate expression for women whose hearts are tender and true like her own.\"}}

'''Keith Ervid Helander''' was a New Zealand [[rugby league]] player. He played one test for the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|Kiwis]] in 1919 against Australia, becoming the 135th player for the national side, in addition to one game for Auckland. In late 1921 he switched codes to Rugby Union and represented Auckland. Helander fought for New Zealand in World War 1.

==Early life==

The [[Auckland Rugby League]] arranged for a match to be played between Returned Soldiers and the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] representative team at the [[Auckland Domain]]. The match was part of the Peace Day celebrations for July 20 which also featured athletics and matches in rugby, rugby league, football, and hockey. Coincidentally the Returned Soldiers won both the rugby union and rugby league matches by the identical score of 26–24. Helander played alongside the likes of [[Craddock Dufty]], and against [[Frank Delgrosso]], [[George Iles]], and [[Sam Lowrie]].<ref>{{cite news

Helander was then selected to play for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] representative team for a match at [[Eden Park]] against the [[Hawke's Bay rugby league team]]. Auckland won the match by 38 points to 13 in front of 9,000 spectators.

Helander then made the New Zealand team for his one and only appearance in the Kiwi jersey. He was selected for the second test in the four-match series with [[Australian national rugby league team|Australia]]. Australia had won the first test comprehensively 44–21 at the [[Basin Reserve]]. The second test was played at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Helander played at lock, wearing the 13 jersey, replacing his [[North Shore Albions]] teammate [[Stan Walters (rugby league)|Stan Walters]] who had moved into the front row. New Zealand won 26 to 10. He was named in the reserves for the third test at the Auckland Domain but did not play.<ref>{{cite news

===Switch to Rugby Union===
In 1921 Helander continued to play for [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]], however on 23 June at a Management Committee meeting of the New Zealand Rugby Union he sought reinstatement into that code.<ref>{{cite news

The reinstatement was granted and he trned out for the [[Grammar TEC RC|Grafton]] club almost immediately in the [[Auckland Rugby Union]] club competition.

The [[Auckland Rugby League]] arranged for a match to be played between Returned Soldiers and the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] representative team at the [[Auckland Domain]]. The match was part of the Peace Day celebrations for July 20 which also featured athletics and matches in rugby, rugby league, football, and hockey. Coincidentally the Returned Soldiers won both the rugby union and rugby league matches by the identical score of 26-24. Helander played alongside the likes of [[Craddock Dufty]], and against [[Frank Delgrosso]], [[George Iles]], and [[Sam Lowrie]].<ref>{{cite news

Helander was then selected to play for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] representative team for a match at [[Eden Park]] against the [[Hawke's Bay rugby league team]]. Auckland won the match by 38 points to 13 in front of 9,000 spectators.

The second test was played at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Helander played at lock, wearing the 13 jersey, replacing his [[North Shore Albions]] team mate [[Stan Walters (rugby league)|Stan Walters]] who had moved into the front row.

The '''Geography of Pakistan''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|جغرافیۂ پاکِستان}}}}) is a profound blend of landscapes varying from plains to deserts, forests,  and plateaus ranging from the coastal areas of the [[Arabian Sea]] in the south to the mountains of the [[Karakoram]], [[Hindukush]], [[Himalayas]] ranges in the north. [[Pakistan]] geologically overlaps both with the [[Indian Plate|Indian]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] where its [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] provinces lie on the north-western corner of the Indian plate while [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and most of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] lie within the Eurasian plate which mainly comprises the [[Iranian Plateau]]. [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] and [[Azad Kashmir]] lie along the edge of the Indian plate and hence are prone to violent [[earthquake]]s where the two tectonic plates collide.

Pakistan is bordered by [[India]] to the east, [[Afghanistan]] to the northwest and [[Iran]] to the west while [[China]] borders the country in the northeast. The nation is geopolitically placed within some of the most controversial regional boundaries which share disputes and have many-a-times escalated military tensions between the nations, e.g., that of [[Kashmir]] with India and the [[Durand Line]] with Afghanistan. Its western borders include the [[Khyber Pass]] and [[Bolan Pass]] that have served as traditional migration routes between Central [[Eurasia]] and [[South Asia]].

At {{convert|881,913|km2}}, Pakistan is the 33rd largest country by area, little more than twice the size of the US state of [[California]], and slightly larger than the Canadian province of [[Alberta]]. {{cn|date=November 2019}}

==International boundaries==
[[Image:Pakistan 2002 CIA map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|International and provincial boundaries of Pakistan]]
[[Image:Pakistan relief location map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|International boundaries of Pakistani terrain]]
Pakistan shares its borders with four neighboring countries – [[People's Republic of China]], [[Afghanistan]], [[India]], and [[Iran]] while [[Tajikistan]] is separated by thin [[Wakhan Corridor]]– adding up to about {{convert|6975|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} in length (excluding the coastal areas).

Pakistan borders Afghanistan at the [[Durand Line]], {{convert|2430|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, which runs from the [[Hindu Kush]] and the [[Pamir Mountains]]. A narrow strip of Afghanistan territory called the [[Wakhan Corridor]] extends between Pakistan and [[Tajikistan]]. From the eastern tip of the Wakhan Corridor starts the Sino-Pak border between the [[People's Republic of China]] and Pakistan spanning about {{convert|510|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. It carries on south-eastward and ends near the [[Karakoram Pass]]. This line was determined from 1961 to 1965 in a series of agreements between China and Pakistan and finally on 03-03-1963 both the governments, of [[Islamabad]] and [[Beijing]], formally agreed. It is understood that if the dispute over Kashmir is resolved, the border would need to be discussed again.<ref name=\"CITEREFPakistanGeography\">{{cite web

The boundary with [[Iran]], {{convert|909|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, was first delimited by a British commission in the same year as the Durand Line was demarcated, separating Iran from what was then British India's [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]] province.<ref name=\"CITEREFPakistanGeography\"/> Modern Iran has a province named [[Sistan va Baluchistan]] that borders Pakistan and has [[Baloch people|Baluchis]] in an ethnic majority. In 1957 Pakistan signed a frontier agreement with Iran in [[Rawalpindi]] according to which the border was officially declared and the two countries haven't had this border as a subject of serious dispute at all.
<!--[[Image:Earthquake Information for Pakistan.gif|thumb|Map depicting tectonic plates shows Indian and Eurasian tectonic plate divide throughout Pakistan and Kashmir where earthquake activity is common.]]-->
The [[Northern Areas]] has five of the world's seventeen highest [[mountain|peaks]] along with highest range of mountains the [[Karakoram]] and [[Himalayas]]. It also has such extensive [[glacier]]s that it has sometimes been called the \"[[Siachen Glacier|Third Pole]]\". The international border-line has been a matter of pivotal dispute between Pakistan and India ever since 1947, and the [[Siachen Glacier]] in northern Kashmir has been an important arena for fighting between the two sides since 1984, although far more soldiers have died of exposure to the cold than from any skirmishes in the conflict between their National Armies facing each other.

The Pakistan-India [[ceasefire]] [[border|line]] runs from the Karakoram Pass west-southwest to a point about 130 kilometers northwest of Lahore. This line, about 770 kilometers long, was arranged with [[United Nations]] (UNO) assistance at the end of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–48. The ceasefire line came into effect on January 1, 1949, after eighteen months of fighting between Indian forces and Pakistani forces and was last adjusted and agreed upon by the two countries according to the [[Shimla Agreement]] of July 2, 1972 between [[Indira Gandhi]] and [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. Since then, it has been generally known as the Line of Control or the (LoC).

The [[India–Pakistan border]] continues irregularly southward for about 1,280 kilometers, following the [[Radcliffe line]], named for Sir [[Cyril Radcliffe, 1st Viscount Radcliffe|Cyril Radcliffe]], the head of the British Boundary Commission on the division of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] provinces of [[British India]] on 13 August 1947.

The southern borders are far less contentious than those in northern Pakistan (Kashmir). The Thar Desert in the province of [[Sindh]] is separated in the south from the salt flats of the Rann of Kachchh (Kutch) by a boundary that was first delineated in 1923–24. After independence and dissolution of Empire, Independent and free Pakistan contested the southern boundary of Sindh, and a succession of border incidents resulted. They were less dangerous and less widespread, however, than the conflict that erupted in Kashmir in the Indo-Pakistani War of August 1965 started with this decisive core of issues. These southern hostilities were ended by British mediation during Harold Wilson's era, and both sides accepted the award of the Indo-Pakistan Western Boundary Case Tribunal designated by the UN secretary general himself. The tribunal made its award on February 19, 1968; delimiting a line of 403 kilometers that was later demarcated by joint survey teams, Of its original claim of some 9,100 square kilometers, Pakistan was awarded only about 780 square kilometers. Beyond the western terminus of the tribunal's award, the final stretch of Pakistan's border with India is about 80 kilometers long, running east and southeast of Sindh to an inlet of the [[Arabian Sea]].

{{Borders of Pakistan}}

==Geographical regions==
[[Image:Pakistan Topography.png|thumb|Topography of Pakistan]]
Pakistan is divided into three major geographic areas: the northern highlands; the [[Indus River]] plain, with two major subdivisions corresponding roughly to the provinces of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]]; and the Balochistan [[Plateau]]. Some geographers designate additional major regions. For example, the mountain ranges along the western border with [[Afghanistan]] are sometimes described separately from the Balochistan Plateau, and on the eastern border with India, south of the [[Sutlej River]], the [[Thar Desert]] may be considered separately from the Indus Plain. Nevertheless, the country may conveniently be visualized in general terms as divided in three by an imaginary line drawn eastward from the [[Khyber Pass]] and another drawn southwest from [[Islamabad]] down the middle of the country. Roughly, then, the northern highlands are north of the imaginary east-west line; the Balochistan Plateau is to the west of the imaginary southwest line; and the Indus Plain lies to the east of that line.

===The northern highlands===
The northern highlands include parts of the Hindu Kush, the [[Karakoram]] Range, and the [[Himalayas]]. This area includes such famous peaks as [[K2]]<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic-art/312055/69374/K2-in-the-Karakoram-Range-northern-Baltistan-Northern-Areas-Pak K2] – Britannica.com</ref> (Mount Godwin Austen, at 8,611 meters the second highest peak in the world). More than one-half of the summits are over 4,500 meters, and more than fifty peaks reach above 6,500 meters. Travel through the area is difficult and dangerous, although the government is attempting to develop certain areas into tourist and trekking sites. Because of their rugged topography and the rigors of the climate, the northern highlands and the [[Himalayas]] to the east have been formidable barriers to movement into Pakistan throughout history.
[[Image:K2 8611.jpg|thumb|[[K2]], at 8,619 metres (28,251 ft), is the world's second highest peak]]

South of the northern highlands and west of the [[Indus River]] plain are the Safed Koh Range along the Afghanistan border and the Sulaiman Range and Kirthar Range, which define the western extent of the province of Sindh and reach almost to the southern coast. The lower reaches are far more arid than those in the north, and they branch into ranges that run generally to the southwest across the province Balochistan. North-south valleys in Balochistan and Sindh have restricted the migration of peoples along the Makran Coast on the Arabian Sea east toward the plains.

Several large passes cut the ranges along the border with [[Afghanistan]]. Among them are the [[Khojak Pass]], about eighty kilometres northwest of Quetta in Balochistan; the Khyber Pass, forty kilometres west of [[Peshawar]] and leading to [[Kabul]]; and the [[Broghol]] Pass in the far north, providing access to the [[Wakhan Corridor]].

Less than one-fifth of Pakistan's land area has the potential for intensive [[agriculture|agricultural]] use. Nearly all of the arable land is actively cultivated, but outputs are low by world standards. Cultivation is sparse in the northern mountains, the southern deserts, and the western [[plateau]]s, but the [[Indus River]] basin in Punjab and northern Sindh has [[fertility|fertile]] soil that enables Pakistan to feed its population under usual climatic conditions.

===The Indus plain===
{{Main|Indo-Gangetic plain}}
The name Indus comes from the Sanskrit word hindu, meaning ocean, from which also come the words Sindh, Hindu, and India. The Indus, one of the great rivers of the world, rises in southwestern [[Tibet]] only about 160 kilometres west of the source of the [[Sutlej River]], which first flows through [[Punjab, India]] and joins the [[Indus]] in [[Pakistani Punjab]], and the [[Brahmaputra]], which runs eastward before turning southwest and flowing through [[India]] and, [[Bangladesh]]. The catchment area of the Indus is estimated at almost 1 million square kilometres, and all of Pakistan's major rivers—the Kabul, Jhelum, and Chenab—flow into it. The Indus River basin is a large, fertile alluvial plain formed by silt from the Indus. This area has been inhabited by agricultural civilizations for at least 5,000 years.

===Baluchistan===
[[Image:NEO sulaiman big.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the Sulaiman Range]]
{{Main|Balochistan, Pakistan}}
Balochistan is located at the eastern edge of the Iranian plateau and in the border region between Southwest, Central, and South Asia. It is geographically the largest of the four provinces at 347,190&nbsp;km² or (134,051 square miles) of Pakistani territory; and composes 48% of the total land area of Pakistan. The population density is very low due to the mountainous terrain and scarcity of water. The southern region is known as [[Makran]]. The central region is known as [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]].

The [[Sulaiman Mountains]] dominate the northeast corner and the Bolan Pass is a natural route into Afghanistan towards Kandahar. Much of the province south of the [[Quetta]] region is sparse desert terrain with pockets of inhabitable towns mostly near rivers and streams. The largest desert is the [[Kharan Desert]] which occupies the most of [[Kharan District]].

This area is subject to frequent [[seismology|seismic]] disturbances because the [[plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] under the Indian plate hits the plate under Eurasia as it continues to move northward and to push the Himalayas ever higher. The region surrounding Quetta is highly prone to [[earthquake]]s. A severe quake in 1931 was followed by one of more destructive force in 1935. The small city of [[Quetta]] was almost completely destroyed, and the adjacent military cantonment was heavily damaged. At least 20,000 people were killed. Tremors continue in the vicinity of [[Quetta]]; the most recent major [[october 2005 kashmir earthquake|earthquake]] in which nearly 10,0000 people died and [[2008 Balochistan earthquake|earthquake]]<ref>Center for the Observation and Modeling of Earthquakes and Tectonics (COMET), 2005. Locating the Kashmir Fault, http://comet.nerc.ac. uk/news_kashmir.html</ref> occurred in October 2008 in which 30,000 people were killed. In January 1991 a severe earthquake destroyed entire villages in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]], but far fewer people were killed in the quake than died in 1935. A major earthquake centred in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's Kohistan District in 1965 also caused heavy damage.

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of Pakistan}}
[[File:Pakistan map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Pakistan map of Köppen climate classification zones]]
[[Image:Pakistan.A2005097.0615.1km.jpg|thumb|Dust storm over Pakistan and surrounding countries, April 7, 2005]]
Pakistan lies in the [[temperate]] zone, immediately above the [[tropic of cancer]]. The climate varies from [[tropical]] to temperate. [[Arid]] conditions exist in the coastal south, characterized by a [[monsoon]] season with adequate rainfall and a dry season with lesser rainfall, while abundant rainfall is experienced by the province of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], and wide variations between extremes of temperature at given locations. Rainfall varies from as little as less than 10&nbsp;inches a year to over 150&nbsp;inches a year, in various parts of the nation. These generalizations should not, however, obscure the distinct differences existing among particular locations. For example, the coastal area along the Arabian Sea is usually warm, whereas the frozen snow-covered ridges of the [[Karakoram]] Range and of other mountains of the far north are so cold year round that they are only accessible by world-class climbers for a few weeks in May and June of each year.

Pakistan has four seasons: a cool, dry winter marked by mild temperatures from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November. The onset and duration of these seasons vary somewhat according to location.

The climate in the capital city of [[Islamabad]] varies from an average daily low of {{convert|5|°C|1}} in January to an average daily high of {{convert|40|°C}} in June. Half of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August, averaging about {{convert|300|mm|in|2}} in each of those two months. The remainder of the year has significantly less rain, amounting to about {{convert|100|mm|in|2}} per month. [[Hail]]storms are common in early spring.

Pakistan's largest city, [[Karachi]], which is also the country's [[Industry|industrial]] center, is more humid than Islamabad but gets significantly lesser rainfall. Only July and August average more than {{convert|50|mm|in|2}} of rainfall in the Karachi area; the remaining months are exceedingly dry with little rainfall. The temperature is also more uniform in Karachi than in Islamabad, ranging from an average daily low of {{convert|13|°C|1}} during winter evenings to an average daily high of {{convert|34|°C|1}} on summer days. Although the summer temperatures do not get as high as those in Punjab, the high humidity causes the residents a great deal of discomfort.

===Water resources===
{{Main|Water resources management in Pakistan}}
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Pakistan}}
Hydrological power is a renewable resource which benefits Pakistan a lot. After the Indus Water Treaty on 1960 World Bank decided that River Sutlej, Ravi and Beas water will be used by India and River Indus, Jhelum and Chenab water will be used by Pakistan. Pakistan was told to build two dams, one tarbela and second Mangla, five barrages, eight link canals, and one gated siphon. For this, India was told to participate 60%, whereas Pakistan, 40%. Pakistan is considering to develop wind turbines to fulfill the demand for electricity. Solar power is now slowly flourishing but it is still installed on a small scale.
 
Pakistan largest river is known as the Indus River which flows from Tibet/China and enters Pakistan through Gilgit Baltistan. The Indus River system is divided into two plains. The Upper Indus Plain starts from northern Pakistan and ends up at Mithankot. The Indus has tributaries on both western and eastern side. The Indus' eastern tributaries are the Jhelum, Chenab, Sutlej, Ravi and Beas. These four rivers flow in Punjab and meet at Panjnad where they are known as Panjnad river. The Indus' western tributaries are the Swat, Kabul, Kurrram, Tochi, Gomal, Zhob rivers. These rivers join the Indus at KPK. At Mithankot these rivers finally meet with the River Indus. After this the Indus flows alone through the Lower Indus Plain. Lower Indus Plain starts from Mithankot up to Thatta where the Indus meets with the Arabian Sea. This place is also known as Indus Delta.

===Fuel resources===
{{Main|Fuel extraction in Pakistan}}
Pakistan has extensive energy resources, including fairly sizable [[natural gas]] reserves, [[petroleum]] oil reserves, [[coal]] fields and large [[hydropower]] potential.

===Agriculture===
{{Main|Agriculture in Pakistan}}
About 26% of Pakistan's total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. The most important crops are [[tobacco]], [[cotton]], [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugarcane]], [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[millets]], [[pulse]]s, [[vegetable oil|oil seeds]], [[barley]], [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s, which together account for more than 75% of the value of total crop output.<ref>Environment of Pakistan pg213.\"Major crop output\" line 13</ref>

===Fishery===
{{Main|Fishing in Pakistan}}
[[Fishery]] and [[fishing industry]] plays an important role in the national economy of [[Pakistan]]. With a coastline of about 1046&nbsp;km, Pakistan has enough fishery resources that remain to be fully developed. It is also a major source of export earning.

===Forestry===
{{Main|Forestry in Pakistan}}
About only 4.1% of land in Pakistan is covered with forests. The forests of Pakistan are a main source of food, [[lumber]], [[paper]], [[fuel wood]], [[latex]], [[medicinal plant|medicine]] as well as used for purposes of [[wildlife]] conservation and [[Eco tourism]].

===Mining===
{{Main|Mining in Pakistan}}
The Salt Range in the [[Potwar Plateau]] has large deposits of [[rock salt]]. Pakistan has extensive mineral resources, including fairly sizable reserves of [[gypsum]], [[limestone]], [[chromite]]s, [[iron ore]], [[halite|rock salt]], [[silver]], [[gold]], precious stones, [[gemstone|gem]]s, [[marble]]s, [[tile]]s, [[copper]], [[sulfur]], [[fire clay]] and silica sand.

==Environment and conservation==
{{Main|Environmental issues in Pakistan}}
The environmental issues is a great problem for the nature and nation of Pakistan and has been disturbing the balance between economic development and environmental protection. As Pakistan is a large importer of both exhaustible and renewable natural resources and a large consumer of [[fossil fuel]]s, the Ministry of Environment of [[Government of Pakistan]] takes responsibility to conserve and [[Environmentalism|protect the environment]].

'''Current issues''': water pollution from raw sewage, industrial wastes, and agricultural runoff; limited natural fresh water resources; a majority of the population does not have access to potable water; [[deforestation]]; [[soil erosion]]; [[desertification]].

===Natural disasters===
{{Main|List of natural disasters in Pakistan}}
Pakistan is subject to frequent [[earthquake]]s which are often severe (especially in north and west) and severe [[flood]]ing along the Indus after heavy rains (July and August). [[Landslide]]s are common in the northern mountains.

===Protected areas===
{{Main|Protected areas of Pakistan}}
There are 15 [[National Parks|national parks]], 72 [[Wildlife Sanctuary|wildlife sanctuaries]], 66 [[game reserve]]s, 9 marine and littoral protected areas, 19 protected [[Ramsar convention|wetlands]] and a number of other protected [[grassland]]s, [[shrubland]]s, [[woodland]]s and [[natural monument]]s.

===International agreements===
Pakistan is a party to several international agreements related to environment and climate, the most prominent among them are:

The '''Geography of Pakistan''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|جغرافیۂ پاکِستان}}}}) is a profound blend of landscapes varying from plains to deserts, forests,  and plateaus ranging from the coastal areas of the [[Arabian Sea]] in the south to the mountains of the [[Karakoram]], [[Hindukush]], [[Himalayas]] ranges in the north. [[Pakistan]] geologically overlaps both with the [[Indian Plate|Indian]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] where its [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] provinces lie on the north-western corner of the Indian plate while [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and most of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] lie within the Eurasian plate which mainly comprises the [[Iranian Plateau]]. [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] and [[Azad Kashmir]] lie along the edge of the Indian plate and hence are prone to violent [[earthquake]]s where the two tectonic plates collide.

Pakistan is bordered by [[India]] to the east, [[Afghanistan]] to the northwest and [[Iran]] to the west while [[China]] borders the country in the northeast. The nation is geopolitically placed within some of the most controversial regional boundaries which share disputes and have many-a-times escalated military tensions between the nations, e.g., that of [[Kashmir]] with India and the [[Durand Line]] with Afghanistan. Its western borders include the [[Khyber Pass]] and [[Bolan Pass]] that have served as traditional migration routes between Central [[Eurasia]] and [[South Asia]].

At {{convert|881,913|km2}}, Pakistan is the 33rd largest country by area, little more than twice the size of the US state of [[California]], and slightly larger than the Canadian province of [[Alberta]]. {{cn|date=November 2019}}

==International boundaries==
[[Image:Pakistan 2002 CIA map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|International and provincial boundaries of Pakistan]]
[[Image:Pakistan relief location map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|International boundaries of Pakistani terrain]]
Pakistan shares its borders with four neighboring countries – [[People's Republic of China]], [[Afghanistan]], [[India]], and [[Iran]] while [[Tajikistan]] is separated by thin [[Wakhan Corridor]]– adding up to about {{convert|6975|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} in length (excluding the coastal areas).

Pakistan borders Afghanistan at the [[Durand Line]], {{convert|2430|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, which runs from the [[Hindu Kush]] and the [[Pamir Mountains]]. A narrow strip of Afghanistan territory called the [[Wakhan Corridor]] extends between Pakistan and [[Tajikistan]]. From the eastern tip of the Wakhan Corridor starts the Sino-Pak border between the [[People's Republic of China]] and Pakistan spanning about {{convert|510|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. It carries on south-eastward and ends near the [[Karakoram Pass]]. This line was determined from 1961 to 1965 in a series of agreements between China and Pakistan and finally on 03-03-1963 both the governments, of [[Islamabad]] and [[Beijing]], formally agreed. It is understood that if the dispute over Kashmir is resolved, the border would need to be discussed again.<ref name=\"CITEREFPakistanGeography\">{{cite web
|url=http://countrystudies.us/pakistan/23.htm

The boundary with [[Iran]], {{convert|909|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, was first delimited by a British commission in the same year as the Durand Line was demarcated, separating Iran from what was then British India's [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]] province.<ref name=\"CITEREFPakistanGeography\"/> Modern Iran has a province named [[Sistan va Baluchistan]] that borders Pakistan and has [[Baloch people|Baluchis]] in an ethnic majority. In 1957 Pakistan signed a frontier agreement with Iran in [[Rawalpindi]] according to which the border was officially declared and the two countries haven't had this border as a subject of serious dispute at all.
<!--[[Image:Earthquake Information for Pakistan.gif|thumb|Map depicting tectonic plates shows Indian and Eurasian tectonic plate divide throughout Pakistan and Kashmir where earthquake activity is common.]]-->
The [[Northern Areas]] has five of the world's seventeen highest [[mountain|peaks]] along with highest range of mountains the [[Karakoram]] and [[Himalayas]]. It also has such extensive [[glacier]]s that it has sometimes been called the \"[[Siachen Glacier|Third Pole]]\". The international border-line has been a matter of pivotal dispute between Pakistan and India ever since 1947, and the [[Siachen Glacier]] in northern Kashmir has been an important arena for fighting between the two sides since 1984, although far more soldiers have died of exposure to the cold than from any skirmishes in the conflict between their National Armies facing each other.

The Pakistan-India [[ceasefire]] [[border|line]] runs from the Karakoram Pass west-southwest to a point about 130 kilometers northwest of Lahore. This line, about 770 kilometers long, was arranged with [[United Nations]] (UNO) assistance at the end of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–48. The ceasefire line came into effect on January 1, 1949, after eighteen months of fighting between Indian forces and Pakistani forces and was last adjusted and agreed upon by the two countries according to the [[Shimla Agreement]] of July 2, 1972 between [[Indira Gandhi]] and [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. Since then, it has been generally known as the Line of Control or the (LoC).

The [[India–Pakistan border]] continues irregularly southward for about 1,280 kilometers, following the [[Radcliffe line]], named for Sir [[Cyril Radcliffe, 1st Viscount Radcliffe|Cyril Radcliffe]], the head of the British Boundary Commission on the division of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] provinces of [[British India]] on 13 August 1947.

The southern borders are far less contentious than those in northern Pakistan (Kashmir). The Thar Desert in the province of [[Sindh]] is separated in the south from the salt flats of the Rann of Kachchh (Kutch) by a boundary that was first delineated in 1923–24. After independence and dissolution of Empire, Independent and free Pakistan contested the southern boundary of Sindh, and a succession of border incidents resulted. They were less dangerous and less widespread, however, than the conflict that erupted in Kashmir in the Indo-Pakistani War of August 1965 started with this decisive core of issues. These southern hostilities were ended by British mediation during Harold Wilson's era, and both sides accepted the award of the Indo-Pakistan Western Boundary Case Tribunal designated by the UN secretary general himself. The tribunal made its award on February 19, 1968; delimiting a line of 403 kilometers that was later demarcated by joint survey teams, Of its original claim of some 9,100 square kilometers, Pakistan was awarded only about 780 square kilometers. Beyond the western terminus of the tribunal's award, the final stretch of Pakistan's border with India is about 80 kilometers long, running east and southeast of Sindh to an inlet of the [[Arabian Sea]].

{{Borders of Pakistan}}

==Geographical regions==
[[Image:Pakistan Topography.png|thumb|Topography of Pakistan]]
Pakistan is divided into three major geographic areas: the northern highlands; the [[Indus River]] plain, with two major subdivisions corresponding roughly to the provinces of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]]; and the Balochistan [[Plateau]]. Some geographers designate additional major regions. For example, the mountain ranges along the western border with [[Afghanistan]] are sometimes described separately from the Balochistan Plateau, and on the eastern border with India, south of the [[Sutlej River]], the [[Thar Desert]] may be considered separately from the Indus Plain. Nevertheless, the country may conveniently be visualized in general terms as divided in three by an imaginary line drawn eastward from the [[Khyber Pass]] and another drawn southwest from [[Islamabad]] down the middle of the country. Roughly, then, the northern highlands are north of the imaginary east-west line; the Balochistan Plateau is to the west of the imaginary southwest line; and the Indus Plain lies to the east of that line.

===The northern highlands===
The northern highlands include parts of the Hindu Kush, the [[Karakoram]] Range, and the [[Himalayas]]. This area includes such famous peaks as [[K2]]<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic-art/312055/69374/K2-in-the-Karakoram-Range-northern-Baltistan-Northern-Areas-Pak K2] – Britannica.com</ref> (Mount Godwin Austen, at 8,611 meters the second highest peak in the world). More than one-half of the summits are over 4,500 meters, and more than fifty peaks reach above 6,500 meters. Travel through the area is difficult and dangerous, although the government is attempting to develop certain areas into tourist and trekking sites. Because of their rugged topography and the rigors of the climate, the northern highlands and the [[Himalayas]] to the east have been formidable barriers to movement into Pakistan throughout history.
[[Image:K2 8611.jpg|thumb|[[K2]], at 8,619 metres (28,251 ft), is the world's second highest peak]]

South of the northern highlands and west of the [[Indus River]] plain are the Safed Koh Range along the Afghanistan border and the Sulaiman Range and Kirthar Range, which define the western extent of the province of Sindh and reach almost to the southern coast. The lower reaches are far more arid than those in the north, and they branch into ranges that run generally to the southwest across the province Balochistan. North-south valleys in Balochistan and Sindh have restricted the migration of peoples along the Makran Coast on the Arabian Sea east toward the plains.

Several large passes cut the ranges along the border with [[Afghanistan]]. Among them are the [[Khojak Pass]], about eighty kilometres northwest of Quetta in Balochistan; the Khyber Pass, forty kilometres west of [[Peshawar]] and leading to [[Kabul]]; and the [[Broghol]] Pass in the far north, providing access to the [[Wakhan Corridor]].

Less than one-fifth of Pakistan's land area has the potential for intensive [[agriculture|agricultural]] use. Nearly all of the arable land is actively cultivated, but outputs are low by world standards. Cultivation is sparse in the northern mountains, the southern deserts, and the western [[plateau]]s, but the [[Indus River]] basin in Punjab and northern Sindh has [[fertility|fertile]] soil that enables Pakistan to feed its population under usual climatic conditions.

===The Indus plain===
{{Main|Indo-Gangetic plain}}
The name Indus comes from the Sanskrit word hindu, meaning ocean, from which also come the words Sindh, Hindu, and India. The Indus, one of the great rivers of the world, rises in southwestern [[Tibet]] only about 160 kilometres west of the source of the [[Sutlej River]], which first flows through [[Punjab, India]] and joins the [[Indus]] in [[Pakistani Punjab]], and the [[Brahmaputra]], which runs eastward before turning southwest and flowing through [[India]] and, [[Bangladesh]]. The catchment area of the Indus is estimated at almost 1 million square kilometres, and all of Pakistan's major rivers—the Kabul, Jhelum and, Chenab—flow into it. The Indus River basin is a large, fertile alluvial plain formed by silt from the Indus. This area has been inhabited by agricultural civilizations for at least 5,000 years.

===Baluchistan===
[[Image:NEO sulaiman big.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the Sulaiman Range]]
{{Main|Balochistan, Pakistan}}
Balochistan is located at the eastern edge of the Iranian plateau and in the border region between Southwest, Central, and South Asia. It is geographically the largest of the four provinces at 347,190&nbsp;km² or (134,051 square miles) of Pakistani territory; and composes 48% of the total land area of Pakistan. The population density is very low due to the mountainous terrain and scarcity of water. The southern region is known as [[Makran]]. The central region is known as [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]].

The [[Sulaiman Mountains]] dominate the northeast corner and the Bolan Pass is a natural route into Afghanistan towards Kandahar. Much of the province south of the [[Quetta]] region is sparse desert terrain with pockets of inhabitable towns mostly near rivers and streams. The largest desert is the [[Kharan Desert]] which occupies the most of [[Kharan District]].

This area is subject to frequent [[seismology|seismic]] disturbances because the [[plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] under the Indian plate hits the plate under Eurasia as it continues to move northward and to push the Himalayas ever higher. The region surrounding Quetta is highly prone to [[earthquake]]s. A severe quake in 1931 was followed by one of more destructive force in 1935. The small city of [[Quetta]] was almost completely destroyed, and the adjacent military cantonment was heavily damaged. At least 20,000 people were killed. Tremors continue in the vicinity of [[Quetta]]; the most recent major [[october 2005 kashmir earthquake|earthquake]] in which nearly 10,0000 people died and [[2008 Balochistan earthquake|earthquake]]<ref>Center for the Observation and Modeling of Earthquakes and Tectonics (COMET), 2005. Locating the Kashmir Fault, http://comet.nerc.ac. uk/news_kashmir.html</ref> occurred in October 2008 in which 30,000 people were killed. In January 1991 a severe earthquake destroyed entire villages in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]], but far fewer people were killed in the quake than died in 1935. A major earthquake centred in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's Kohistan District in 1965 also caused heavy damage.

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of Pakistan}}
[[File:Pakistan map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Pakistan map of Köppen climate classification zones]]
[[Image:Pakistan.A2005097.0615.1km.jpg|thumb|Dust storm over Pakistan and surrounding countries, April 7, 2005]]
Pakistan lies in the [[temperate]] zone, immediately above the [[tropic of cancer]]. The climate varies from [[tropical]] to temperate. [[Arid]] conditions exist in the coastal south, characterized by a [[monsoon]] season with adequate rainfall and a dry season with lesser rainfall, while abundant rainfall is experienced by the province of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], and wide variations between extremes of temperature at given locations. Rainfall varies from as little as less than 10&nbsp;inches a year to over 150&nbsp;inches a year, in various parts of the nation. These generalizations should not, however, obscure the distinct differences existing among particular locations. For example, the coastal area along the Arabian Sea is usually warm, whereas the frozen snow-covered ridges of the [[Karakoram]] Range and of other mountains of the far north are so cold year round that they are only accessible by world-class climbers for a few weeks in May and June of each year.

Pakistan has four seasons: a cool, dry winter marked by mild temperatures from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November. The onset and duration of these seasons vary somewhat according to location.

The climate in the capital city of [[Islamabad]] varies from an average daily low of {{convert|5|°C|1}} in January to an average daily high of {{convert|40|°C}} in June. Half of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August, averaging about {{convert|300|mm|in|2}} in each of those two months. The remainder of the year has significantly less rain, amounting to about {{convert|100|mm|in|2}} per month. [[Hail]]storms are common in early spring.

Pakistan's largest city, [[Karachi]], which is also the country's [[Industry|industrial]] center, is more humid than Islamabad but gets significantly lesser rainfall. Only July and August average more than {{convert|50|mm|in|2}} of rainfall in the Karachi area; the remaining months are exceedingly dry with little rainfall. The temperature is also more uniform in Karachi than in Islamabad, ranging from an average daily low of {{convert|13|°C|1}} during winter evenings to an average daily high of {{convert|34|°C|1}} on summer days. Although the summer temperatures do not get as high as those in Punjab, the high humidity causes the residents a great deal of discomfort.

===Water resources===
{{Main|Water resources management in Pakistan}}
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Pakistan}}
Hydrological power is a renewable resource which benefits Pakistan a lot. After the Indus Water Treaty on 1960 World Bank decided that River Sutlej, Ravi and Beas water will be used by India and River Indus, Jhelum and Chenab water will be used by Pakistan. Pakistan was told to build two dams, one tarbela and second Mangla, five barrages, eight link canals, and one gated siphon. For this, India was told to participate 60%, whereas Pakistan, 40%. Pakistan is considering to develop wind turbines to fulfill the demand for electricity. Solar power is now slowly flourishing but it is still installed on a small scale.
 
Pakistan largest river is known as the Indus River which flows from Tibet/China and enters Pakistan through Gilgit Baltistan. The Indus River system is divided into two plains. The Upper Indus Plain starts from northern Pakistan and ends up at Mithankot. The Indus has tributaries on both western and eastern side. The Indus' eastern tributaries are the Jhelum, Chenab, Sutlej, Ravi and Beas. These four rivers flow in Punjab and meet at Panjnad where they are known as Panjnad river. The Indus' western tributaries are the Swat, Kabul, Kurrram, Tochi, Gomal, Zhob rivers. These rivers join the Indus at KPK. At Mithankot these rivers finally meet with the River Indus. After this the Indus flows alone through the Lower Indus Plain. Lower Indus Plain starts from Mithankot up to Thatta where the Indus meets with the Arabian Sea. This place is also known as Indus Delta.

===Fuel resources===
{{Main|Fuel extraction in Pakistan}}
Pakistan has extensive energy resources, including fairly sizable [[natural gas]] reserves, [[petroleum]] oil reserves, [[coal]] fields and large [[hydropower]] potential.

===Agriculture===
{{Main|Agriculture in Pakistan}}
About 26% of Pakistan's total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. The most important crops are [[tobacco]], [[cotton]], [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugarcane]], [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[millets]], [[pulse]]s, [[vegetable oil|oil seeds]], [[barley]], [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s, which together account for more than 75% of the value of total crop output.<ref>Environment of Pakistan pg213.\"Major crop output\" line 13</ref>

===Fishery===
{{Main|Fishing in Pakistan}}
[[Fishery]] and [[fishing industry]] plays an important role in the national economy of [[Pakistan]]. With a coastline of about 1046&nbsp;km, Pakistan has enough fishery resources that remain to be fully developed. It is also a major source of export earning.

===Forestry===
{{Main|Forestry in Pakistan}}
About only 4.1% of land in Pakistan is covered with forests. The forests of Pakistan are a main source of food, [[lumber]], [[paper]], [[fuel wood]], [[latex]], [[medicinal plant|medicine]] as well as used for purposes of [[wildlife]] conservation and [[Eco tourism]].

===Mining===
{{Main|Mining in Pakistan}}
The Salt Range in the [[Potwar Plateau]] has large deposits of [[rock salt]]. Pakistan has extensive mineral resources, including fairly sizable reserves of [[gypsum]], [[limestone]], [[chromite]]s, [[iron ore]], [[halite|rock salt]], [[silver]], [[gold]], precious stones, [[gemstone|gem]]s, [[marble]]s, [[tile]]s, [[copper]], [[sulfur]], [[fire clay]] and silica sand.

==Environment and conservation==
{{Main|Environmental issues in Pakistan}}
The environmental issues is a great problem for the nature and nation of Pakistan and has been disturbing the balance between economic development and environmental protection. As Pakistan is a large importer of both exhaustible and renewable natural resources and a large consumer of [[fossil fuel]]s, the Ministry of Environment of [[Government of Pakistan]] takes responsibility to conserve and [[Environmentalism|protect the environment]].

'''Current issues''': water pollution from raw sewage, industrial wastes, and agricultural runoff; limited natural fresh water resources; a majority of the population does not have access to potable water; [[deforestation]]; [[soil erosion]]; [[desertification]].

===Natural disasters===
{{Main|List of natural disasters in Pakistan}}
Pakistan is subject to frequent [[earthquake]]s which are often severe (especially in north and west) and severe [[flood]]ing along the Indus after heavy rains (July and August). [[Landslide]]s are common in the northern mountains.

===Protected areas===
{{Main|Protected areas of Pakistan}}
There are 15 [[National Parks|national parks]], 72 [[Wildlife Sanctuary|wildlife sanctuaries]], 66 [[game reserve]]s, 9 marine and littoral protected areas, 19 protected [[Ramsar convention|wetlands]] and a number of other protected [[grassland]]s, [[shrubland]]s, [[woodland]]s and [[natural monument]]s.

===International agreements===
Pakistan is a party to several international agreements related to environment and climate, the most prominent among them are:

[[File:Emperor Akbar.png|alt=|thumb|Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] first introduced the Bengali New Year and [[official]] Bengali [[calendar]] to ease the [[tax]] collection process.]]

==Origins==
During the Mughal rule, land taxes were collected from Bengali people according to the Islamic Hijri calendar. This calendar was a lunar calendar, and its new year did not coincide with the solar agricultural cycles. According to some sources, the festival was a tradition introduced in Bengal during the rule of Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] to time the tax year to the harvest, and the Bangla year was therewith called ''Bangabda''. Akbar asked the royal astronomer [[Fathullah Shirazi]] to create a new calendar by combining the lunar [[Islamic Calendar|Islamic calendar]] and solar [[Hindu calendar]] already in use, and this was known as ''Fawsholi shawn'' (harvest calendar). According to some historians, this started the [[Bengali calendar]].<ref name= Chakrabarti114>{{cite book|author1=Kunal Chakrabarti|author2=Shubhra Chakrabarti|title=Historical Dictionary of the Bengalis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVOFAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA114 |year= 2013|publisher =Scarecrow|isbn= 978-0-8108-8024-5|pages=114–115}}</ref><ref name=banglapedia>{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2015 |title=Pahela Baishakh |encyclopedia=Banglapedia |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |location=Dhaka, Bangladesh |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Pahela_Baishakh}}</ref> According to the Bangladeshi academic and foklorist [[Shamsuzzaman Khan]], it could be Nawab [[Murshid Quli Khan]], a Mughal governor, who first used the tradition of ''Punyaho'' as \"a day for ceremonial land tax collection\", and used Akbar's fiscal policy to start the Bangla calendar.<ref name=meghna>{{Cite book |title=The Bangladesh Reader: History, Culture, Politics |last=Guhathakurta |first=Meghna  |last2=Schendel |first2=Willem van  |publisher=Duke University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780822353188 |pages=17–18}}</ref>

According to Shamsuzzaman Khan,<ref name=meghna/> and Nitish Sengupta, the origin of the Bengali calendar is unclear.<ref name=\"Sengupta2011\">{{cite book|author=Nitish K. Sengupta|title=Land of Two Rivers: A History of Bengal from the Mahabharata to Mujib|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-341678-4|pages=96–98}}</ref> According to Shamsuzzaman, \"it is called Bangla shawn or shaal, which are Arabic and Parsian words respectively, suggests that it was introduced by a Muslim king or sultan.\"<ref name=meghna/> In contrast, according to Sengupta, its traditional name is ''Bangabda''.<ref name=\"Sengupta2011\"/><ref>Syed Ashraf Ali, [http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangabda Bangabda], National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh</ref>

Some historians attribute the Bengali calendar to the 7th century king [[Shashanka]].<ref name=meghna/><ref name=\"Sengupta2011\"/> The term ''Bangabda'' (Bangla year) is found too in two Shiva temples many centuries older than Akbar era, suggesting that Bengali calendar existed before Akbar's time.<ref name=\"Sengupta2011\"/> It is also unclear, whether it was adopted by Hussain Shah or Akbar. The tradition to use the Bengali calendar may have been started by Hussain Shah before Akbar.<ref name=\"Sengupta2011\"/> Regardless of who adopted the Bengali calendar and the new year, states Sengupta, it helped collect land taxes after the spring harvest based on traditional Bengali calendar, because the Islamic Hijri calendar created administrative difficulties in setting the collection date.<ref name=\"Sengupta2011\"/>

In rural Bengali communities of India, the Bengali calendar is credited to \"Bikromaditto\", like many other parts of India and [[Nepal]]. However, unlike these regions where it starts in 57 BCE, the Bengali calendar starts from 593 CE suggesting that the starting reference year was adjusted at some point.<ref name=\"Klass1978p166\">{{cite book|author=Morton Klass|title=From Field to Factory: Community Structure and Industrialization in West Bengal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAZ2JBQ2vwsC&pg=PA166|year=1978|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-0420-8|pages=166–167}}</ref><ref name=\"Nicholas2003p13\">{{cite book|author=Ralph W.

It retains the historic Sanskrit names of the months, with the first month as Boishakh.<ref name= Chakrabarti114/> Their calendar remains tied to the Hindu calendar system and is used to set the various Bengali Hindu festivals. For Bengalis of West Bengal and other Indian states, the festival falls either on 14 or 15 April every year.<ref name= Chakrabarti114/>

In Bangladesh however, the old Bengali calendar was modified in 1966 by a committee headed by [[Muhammad Shahidullah]], making the first five months 31 days long, rest 30 days each, with the month of Falgun adjusted to 31 days in every leap year.<ref name= Chakrabarti114/> This was officially adopted by Bangladesh in 1987.

[[File:Colors of Celebration!-4.JPG|thumb|left|240px|Colorful celebration of Pohela Boishakh in Dhaka]]
The celebrations start in Dhaka at dawn with a rendition of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s song \"Esho he Boishakh\" by [[Chhayanaut]] under the banyan tree at Ramna (the Ramna Batamul). An integral part of the festivities is the [[Mangal Shobhajatra]], a traditional colourful procession organised by the students of the [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]] (Charukala).

[[File:Emperor Akbar.png|alt=|thumb|Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] first introduced the Bengali New Year and [[official]] Bengali [[calendar]] to ease the [[tax]] collection process.]]

==Origins==
During the Mughal rule, land taxes were collected from Bengali people according to the Islamic Hijri calendar. This calendar was a lunar calendar, and its new year did not coincide with the solar agricultural cycles. According to some sources, the festival was a tradition introduced in Bengal during the rule of Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] to time the tax year to the harvest, and the Bangla year was therewith called ''Bangabda''. Akbar asked the royal astronomer [[Fathullah Shirazi]] to create a new calendar by combining the lunar [[Islamic Calendar|Islamic calendar]] and solar [[Hindu calendar]] already in use, and this was known as ''Fawsholi shawn'' (harvest calendar). According to some historians, this started the [[Bengali calendar]].<ref name= Chakrabarti114>{{cite book|author1=Kunal Chakrabarti|author2=Shubhra Chakrabarti|title=Historical Dictionary of the Bengalis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVOFAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA114 |year= 2013|publisher =Scarecrow|isbn= 978-0-8108-8024-5|pages=114–115}}</ref><ref name=banglapedia>{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2015 |title=Pahela Baishakh |encyclopedia=Banglapedia |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |location=Dhaka, Bangladesh |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Pahela_Baishakh}}</ref> According to the Bangladeshi academic and foklorist [[Shamsuzzaman Khan]], it could be Nawab [[Murshid Quli Khan]], a Mughal governor, who first used the tradition of ''Punyaho'' as \"a day for ceremonial land tax collection\", and used Akbar's fiscal policy to start the Bangla calendar.<ref name=meghna>{{Cite book |title=The Bangladesh Reader: History, Culture, Politics |last=Guhathakurta |first=Meghna  |last2=Schendel |first2=Willem van  |publisher=Duke University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780822353188 |pages=17–18}}</ref>

According to Shamsuzzaman Khan,<ref name=meghna/> and Nitish Sengupta, the origin of the Bengali calendar is unclear.<ref name=\"Sengupta2011\">{{cite book|author=Nitish K. Sengupta|title=Land of Two Rivers: A History of Bengal from the Mahabharata to Mujib|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-341678-4|pages=96–98}}</ref> According to Shamsuzzaman, \"it is called Bangla shawn or shaal, which are Arabic and Parsian words respectively, suggests that it was introduced by a Muslim king or sultan.\"<ref name=meghna/> In contrast, according to Sengupta, its traditional name is ''Bangabda''.<ref name=\"Sengupta2011\"/><ref>Syed Ashraf Ali, [http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangabda Bangabda], National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh</ref>

Some historians attribute the Bengali calendar to the 7th century king [[Shashanka]].<ref name=meghna/><ref name=\"Sengupta2011\"/> The term ''Bangabda'' (Bangla year) is found too in two Shiva temples many centuries older than Akbar era, suggesting that Bengali calendar existed before Akbar's time.<ref name=\"Sengupta2011\"/> It is also unclear, whether it was adopted by Hussain Shah or Akbar. The tradition to use the Bengali calendar may have been started by Hussain Shah before Akbar.<ref name=\"Sengupta2011\"/> Regardless of who adopted the Bengali calendar and the new year, states Sengupta, it helped collect land taxes after the spring harvest based on traditional Bengali calendar, because the Islamic Hijri calendar created administrative difficulties in setting the collection date.<ref name=\"Sengupta2011\"/>

In rural Bengali communities of India, the Bengali calendar is credited to \"Bikromaditto\", like many other parts of India and [[Nepal]]. However, unlike these regions where it starts in 57 BCE, the Bengali calendar starts from 593 CE suggesting that the starting reference year was adjusted at some point.<ref name=\"Klass1978p166\">{{cite book|author=Morton Klass|title=From Field to Factory: Community Structure and Industrialization in West Bengal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAZ2JBQ2vwsC&pg=PA166|year=1978|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-0420-8|pages=166–167}}</ref><ref name=\"Nicholas2003p13\">{{cite book|author=Ralph W.

The '''Fire HD''', also known as '''Kindle Fire HD''', is a member of the [[Amazon Fire]] family of [[tablet computer]]s.  The eight generation family consists of: 7\" (2012 model), 8.9\" (2012 model), 7\" (2013 model), 6\" & 7\" (2014 models), 8\" & 10.1\" (2015 models), 8\" (2016 model), 8\" & 10.1\" (2017 models), 8\" (2018 model) and 10.1\" (2019 model). These devices run the [[Fire OS]] operating system.

==History==
The first model was announced on September 6, 2012 and was available in two versions, 7\" and 8.9\".  The 7\" model was released in United States on September 14, then France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom on October 25 and in Japan on December 18. The 8.9\" model was released on November 20 in United States, in Japan on March 12, 2013 in Germany on March 13, and in India on June 27.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/geekmom/2012/09/kobo-new-ereaders/|title=Kobo Announces Their New E-Readers|first=|last=Jules|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"amazones\">[https://www.amazon.es/s/?__mk_es_ES=%C5M%C5Z%D5%D1&url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD Amazon.es: Kindle Fire HD]</ref><ref name=\"amazonit\">[https://www.amazon.it/s/?__mk_it_IT=%C5M%C5Z%D5%D1&url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD&x=0&y=0 Amazon.it: Kindle Fire HD]</ref><ref name=\"amazonfr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.fr/s/?__mk_fr_FR%253D%25C5M%25C5Z%25D5%25D1%2526url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD|title=Amazon.fr : Kindle Fire HD|website=www.amazon.fr}}</ref><ref name=\"amazonde\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/s/?__mk_de_DE%253D%25C5M%25C5Z%25D5%25D1%2526url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD|title=Suchergebnis auf Amazon.de für: Kindle Fire HD|website=www.amazon.de}}</ref><ref name=\"amazonuk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD&x=0&y=0|title=Amazon.co.uk: Kindle Fire HD|website=www.amazon.co.uk}}</ref>

On September 25, 2013, the Fire HD second generation was released. The price of the Fire HD 7\" was reduced to $139, the processor speed was upgraded to 1.5&nbsp;GHz, upgraded from \"Android based\" OS to a compatible [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of Android named [[Fire OS]] 3, removed the front camera, used a new form factor and decreased the available storage options. In addition, the Fire HD's successor the [[Kindle Fire HDX]] was introduced.

On October 2, 2014, the Fire HD third generation was released, which is part of the Fire Tablet's fourth generation, with 6-inch and 7-inch [[touchscreen]] sizes. In addition, the Fire HD Kids Edition was released, which is the same device as the Fire HD 6 except it comes with a case and one-year subscription to Kindle Freetime apps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-kindle-fire-tablets/|title=Amazon Kindle Cheat Sheet|work=CNET|accessdate=2014-09-19}}</ref> In addition, the name \"Kindle\" was officially removed from the tablets' name.

In September 2015, Amazon released a new range of Fire tablets with 7, 8, and 10.1 inch sizes. The 7 inch was simply called the [[kindle fire|Fire 7]], while the 8\" and 10.1\" were called Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10 respectively. The Fire 7 is unique as it is, thus far, the lowest priced Fire tablet at $50.  In September 2016, Amazon announced the new Fire HD 8 with Alexa<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon's new Fire HD 8 is its first tablet with Alexa|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/08/amazon-fire-hd-8-tablet-with-alexa/|website=engadget.com|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref> starting at $90.

In 2017, the seventh Generation Fire 7 Fire HD 8 were released. Some differences between the 6th and 7th Generation HD 8 models were the price, the gyroscope removal, the increase of maximum SD card expansion, and the better graphics chip.

In September 2018, Amazon refreshed their Fire tablet line with the release of eighth Generation Fire HD 8/Kids Edition and HD 10. The price remained the same as last year's model with minor upgrade on the hardware where the external storage is expandable to 400GB. On the software side, the 2018 model is preinstalled with Fire OS 6 that allows hands-free Alexa control.

On October 7, 2019 Amazon announced an update to the Fire HD 10 which will be released on October 30, 2019. The major hardware differences compared to the previous version were replacement of microUSB with USB-C, a faster processor (upgraded from Quad-Core up to 1.8 GHz to Octa-core 2.0 GHz, which Amazon claims is 30% faster than the previous one) and battery life that is 2 hours longer than the previous generation. The screen size and price remained unchanged. A new color option, white, has also been added.

== Design ==

=== Hardware ===
The Fire tablets feature multi-touch [[touchscreen]] [[LCD]] screens. The first generation 7\" model contains a [[Texas Instruments]] [[OMAP]] 4460 processor, while the 8.9\" model uses an OMAP 4470 processor.<ref name=\"launch2012\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYi1jZXz9Kg|title=Amazon Kindle Press Conference — September 6, 2012 |work=YouTube}}</ref> All three models feature [[Dolby Digital Plus|Dolby audio]] and stereo speakers. The 7\" model's speakers are dual-driver, while the 8.9\" model's are single-driver.<ref name=\"launch2012\" /> The device has two Wi-Fi antennas on the [[ISM band|2.4&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz bands]] which utilize [[MIMO]] to improve reception.<ref name=\"launch2012\" /> The Fire HD also added [[Bluetooth]] connectivity allowing users to connect an array of wireless accessories including keyboards.<ref name=\"launch2012\" /> The first generation models have an HDMI port, but this is missing from future generations.

In June 2016, Amazon released a version of the Fire HD 10 that has an aluminum exterior instead of plastic like the other Fire tablets, and is available at the same price as the plastic version.<ref>[https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/2/11838204/amazon-adds-metal-fire-10-64gb Amazon now sells a metal version of its Fire 10 tablet] The Verge Retrieved 2 June 2016.</ref>

=== Software ===
The 2012 models use software that introduced user profiles for sharing among family members and the ability to place absolute limits on total usage or usage of individual features, called FreeTime, and tracks the user's reading speed to predict when the user will finish a chapter or book. The OS is based on a version of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Android Ice Cream Sandwich|4.0.3 \"Ice Cream Sandwich\"]]. This does not allow use of [[Google Play]], limiting the number of apps accessible for the Fire HD. Fire HD software updates can be received [[Over-the-air programming|OTA]] or from the support websites.<ref name=\"kf-specsheet\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201016350|title=Amazon.com Help: Kindle Fire HD 7\" (2nd Generation) Software Updates|website=www.amazon.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201075600|title=Amazon.com Help: Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" (2nd Generation) Software Updates|website=www.amazon.com}}</ref>

The Fire HD 7\" second generation used [[Fire OS]] 3. Note that although this version is called the Fire HD 7\", it is not the successor to the original Fire HD. This model is the successor to the Fire second generation. The Fire HD models second generation were updated to FireOS 4.1.1, based on Android 4.4.4, in Q3 2014.

The Fire HD 6\" and 7\" third generation uses Fire OS 4 \"Sangria\", which features profiles so each user on the tablet can have their own settings and apps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.androidguys.com/2014/09/17/whats-new-amazons-fire-os-4-0-sangria/|title=What's new with Amazon's Fire OS 4.0 \"Sangria\"?|work=AndroidGuys}}</ref>

The Fire HD 8 and 10 fifth generation uses Fire OS 5 \"Bellini\" and was released in late 2015.  In September 2016, Amazon released virtual assistant Alexa for the sixth generation Fire tablets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/08/amazon-fire-alexa/|title=Amazon Debuts Its First Fire Tablet With Virtual Assistant Alexa|website=fortune.com|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>

The 2018 model of the Fire HD 8 has Fire OS 6 preinstalled, which is based on [[Android Nougat|Android 7.1 \"Nougat\"]]. It also includes Alexa Hands-Free and the new \"Show Mode\", in which the tablet acts like an [[Amazon Echo Show]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.xda-developers.com/amazon-fire-hd-8-android-nougat/|title=Amazon's new Fire HD 8 tablets with Fire OS 6 (Android Nougat)|date=2018-09-06|work=xda-developers|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}</ref>

In addition, the Fire HD Kids Edition was released, which is the same device as the Fire HD 6 except it comes with a case and one-year subscription to Kindle Freetime apps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-kindle-fire-tablets/|title=Amazon Kindle Cheat Sheet|work=CNET|accessdate=2014-09-19}}</ref> In addition, the name \"Kindle\" was officially removed from the tablets' name.

In September 2015, Amazon released a new range of Fire tablets with 7, 8, and 10.1 inch sizes. The 7 inch was simply called the [[kindle fire|Fire 7]], while the 8\" and 10.1\" were called Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10 respectively. The Fire 7 is unique as it is, thus far, the lowest priced Fire tablet at $50.  In September 2016, Amazon announced the new Fire HD 8 with Alexa<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon's new Fire HD 8 is its first tablet with Alexa|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/08/amazon-fire-hd-8-tablet-with-alexa/|website=engadget.com|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref> starting at $90.

In 2017, the seventh Generation Fire 7 Fire HD 8 were released. Some differences between the 6th and 7th Generation HD 8 models were the price, the gyroscope removal, the increase of maximum SD card expansion, and the better graphics chip.

In September 2018, Amazon refreshed their Fire tablet line with the release of eighth Generation Fire HD 8/Kids Edition and HD 10. The price remained the same as last year's model with minor upgrade on the hardware where the external storage is expandable to 400GB. On the software side, the 2018 model is preinstalled with Fire OS 6 that allows hands-free Alexa control.

On October 7, 2019 Amazon announced an update to the Fire HD 10 which will be released on October 30, 2019. The major hardware differences compared to the previous version were replacement of microUSB with USB-C, a faster processor (upgraded from Quad-Core up to 1.8 GHz to Octa-core 2.0 GHz, which Amazon claims is 30% faster than the previous one) and battery life that is 2 hours longer than the previous generation. The screen size and price remained unchanged. A new color option, white, has also been added.

== Design ==

=== Hardware ===
The Fire tablets feature multi-touch [[touchscreen]] [[LCD]] screens. The first generation 7\" model contains a [[Texas Instruments]] [[OMAP]] 4460 processor, while the 8.9\" model uses an OMAP 4470 processor.<ref name=\"launch2012\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYi1jZXz9Kg|title=Amazon Kindle Press Conference — September 6, 2012 |work=YouTube}}</ref> All three models feature [[Dolby Digital Plus|Dolby audio]] and stereo speakers. The 7\" model's speakers are dual-driver, while the 8.9\" model's are single-driver.<ref name=\"launch2012\" /> The device has two Wi-Fi antennas on the [[ISM band|2.4&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz bands]] which utilize [[MIMO]] to improve reception.<ref name=\"launch2012\" /> The Fire HD also added [[Bluetooth]] connectivity allowing users to connect an array of wireless accessories including keyboards.<ref name=\"launch2012\" /> The first generation models have an HDMI port, but this is missing from future generations.

In June 2016, Amazon released a version of the Fire HD 10 that has an aluminum exterior instead of plastic like the other Fire tablets, and is available at the same price as the plastic version.<ref>[https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/2/11838204/amazon-adds-metal-fire-10-64gb Amazon now sells a metal version of its Fire 10 tablet] The Verge Retrieved 2 June 2016.</ref>

=== Software ===
The 2012 models use software that introduced user profiles for sharing among family members and the ability to place absolute limits on total usage or usage of individual features, called FreeTime, and tracks the user's reading speed to predict when the user will finish a chapter or book. The OS is based on a version of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Android Ice Cream Sandwich|4.0.3 \"Ice Cream Sandwich\"]]. This does not allow use of [[Google Play]], limiting the number of apps accessible for the Fire HD. Fire HD software updates can be received [[Over-the-air programming|OTA]] or from the support websites.<ref name=\"kf-specsheet\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201016350|title=Amazon.com Help: Kindle Fire HD 7\" (2nd Generation) Software Updates|website=www.amazon.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201075600|title=Amazon.com Help: Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" (2nd Generation) Software Updates|website=www.amazon.com}}</ref>

The Fire HD 7\" second generation used [[Fire OS]] 3. Note that although this version is called the Fire HD 7\", it is not the successor to the original Fire HD. This model is the successor to the Fire second generation. The Fire HD models second generation were updated to FireOS 4.1.1, based on Android 4.4.4, in Q3 2014.

The Fire HD 6\" and 7\" third generation uses Fire OS 4 \"Sangria\", which features profiles so each user on the tablet can have their own settings and apps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.androidguys.com/2014/09/17/whats-new-amazons-fire-os-4-0-sangria/|title=What's new with Amazon's Fire OS 4.0 \"Sangria\"?|work=AndroidGuys}}</ref>

The Fire HD 8 and 10 fifth generation uses Fire OS 5 \"Bellini\" and was released in late 2015.  In September 2016, Amazon released virtual assistant Alexa for the sixth generation Fire tablets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/08/amazon-fire-alexa/|title=Amazon Debuts Its First Fire Tablet With Virtual Assistant Alexa|website=fortune.com|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>

The 2018 model of the Fire HD 8 has Fire OS 6 preinstalled, which is based on [[Android Nougat|Android 7.1 \"Nougat\"]]. It also includes Alexa Hands-Free and the new \"Show Mode\", in which the tablet acts like an [[Amazon Echo Show]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.xda-developers.com/amazon-fire-hd-8-android-nougat/|title=Amazon's new Fire HD 8 tablets with Fire OS 6 (Android Nougat)|date=2018-09-06|work=xda-developers|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}</ref>

The 2019 model of the Fire HD 10 has Fire OS 7 preinstalled, which is based on [[Android Nougat|Android 9 \"Pie\"]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xda-developers.com/new-amazon-fire-hd-10-usb-c/|title=Amazon's new Fire HD 10 tablet has USB-C charging and costs $149|date=2019-10-07|website=xda-developers|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref>

== History ==

=== 2014–2016: Pre-debut ===
On April 11, 2014, [[Hiroyuki Igarashi|Exile Hiro]] announced on the TV show ''Sukkiri!!'' a new group being formed for Exile Tribe.

On September 12, 2014, the final sixteen members of The Rampage were recruited from participants of \"''Exile Performer Battle Audition''\", a competition to be part of EXILE, \"''Vocal Battle Audition 4''\", a competition for young people who dream of being vocalists, and \"''Global Japan Challenge''\", a program for young people who dream of performing internationally and form a dance and vocal group. The name of the group, \"The Rampage (run about wildly)\" shows that the group would always dance wildly and passionately on stage. Before debuting, they went on their [[Musha shugyō|Musha Shugyo]], touring the country for 2 years as part of their training. They performed for free in various places in Japan. Through these performances, they bonded as a group, improved as performers and gained fans. As part of their Musha Shugyo, the group also participated in Exile Tribe's ''\"Exile Tribe Perfect Year Live Tour Tower of Wish 2014 ~The Revolution~''\" dome tours. In their final year of Musha Shugyo, the group split up into 3 separate teams to promote and improve themselves more individually.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ldh.co.jp/eng/management/the_rampage/|title=THE RAMPAGE from EXILE TRIBE {{!}} MANAGEMENT {{!}} LDH|website=www.ldh.co.jp|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>

Prior to their debut, the members of the group (specifically the performers) also participated in tours from other [[LDH (company)|LDH]] artists as support members, such as [[Exile The Second]]'s tour ''Exile the Second Live Tour 2016–2017 \"Wild Wild Warriors\".''

On September 27, 2016, it was revealed the group would make their major debut with their first single in early 2017.

=== 2017: Debut with \"Lightning\" and first tour ===
The Rampage debuted in January 25, 2017, with their first single \"Lightning\" peaking at #2 on the [[Oricon|Oricon Weekly Charts]] and being certified 'Gold' by the [[RIAJ]] for selling 100,000 physical copies. The group received their first major award in the [[MTV Video Music Awards Japan]] for their \"Lightning\" music video.

In the following months of April and July The Rampage released their second and third single \"Frontiers\" and 'Dirty Disco' which peaked at #3 and #5 respectively.

In early November, The Rampage released their fourth single '100degrees'. The single reached #6 in the Oricon Weekly Charts and earned the group the 'New Wave Artist Award' at the [[Asia Artist Awards]] where they performed for the first time overseas. Later on December The Rampage embarked on their first tour ever ''The Rampage Live Tour 2017-2018'' \"''Go on the Rampage''\" starting in December and ending in March 2018.

== History ==

=== 2014–2016: Pre-debut ===
On April 11, 2014, [[Hiroyuki Igarashi|Exile Hiro]] announced on the TV show ''Sukkiri!!'' a new group being formed for Exile Tribe.

On September 12, 2014, the final sixteen members of The Rampage were recruited from participants of \"''Exile Performer Battle Audition''\", a competition to be part of EXILE, \"''Vocal Battle Audition 4''\", a competition for young people who dream of being vocalists, and \"''Global Japan Challenge''\", a program for young people who dream of performing internationally and form a dance and vocal group. The name of the group, \"The Rampage (run about wildly)\" shows that the group would always dance wildly and passionately on stage. Before debuting, they went on their [[Musha shugyō|Musha Shugyo]], touring the country for 2 years as part of their training. They performed for free in various places in Japan. Through these performances, they bonded as a group, improved as performers and gained fans. As part of their Musha Shugyo, the group also participated in Exile Tribe's ''\"Exile Tribe Perfect Year Live Tour Tower of Wish 2014 ~The Revolution~''\" dome tours. In their final year of Musha Shugyo, the group split up into 3 separate teams to promote and improve themselves more individually.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ldh.co.jp/eng/management/the_rampage/|title=THE RAMPAGE from EXILE TRIBE {{!}} MANAGEMENT {{!}} LDH|website=www.ldh.co.jp|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>

Prior to their debut, the members of the group (specifically the performers) also participated in tours from other [[LDH (company)|LDH]] artists as support members, such as [[Exile The Second]]'s tour ''Exile the Second Live Tour 2016–2017 \"Wild Wild Warriors\".''

On September 27, 2016, it was revealed the group would make their major debut with their first single in early 2017.

The Rampage debuted in January 25, 2017, with their first single \"Lightning\" peaking at #2 on the [[Oricon|Oricon Weekly Charts]] and being certified 'Gold' by the [[RIAJ]] for selling 100,000 physical copies. The group received their first major award in the [[MTV Video Music Awards Japan]] for their \"Lightning\" music video.

In the following months of April and July The Rampage released their second and third single \"Frontiers\" and 'Dirty Disco' which peaked at #3 and #5 respectively.

In early November, The Rampage released their fourth single '100degrees'. The single reached #6 in the Oricon Weekly Charts and earned the group the 'New Wave Artist Award' at the [[Asia Artist Awards]] where they performed for the first time overseas. Later on December The Rampage embarked on their first tour ever ''The Rampage Live Tour 2017-2018'' \"''Go on the Rampage''\" starting in December and ending in March 2018.

Born in [[Gig Harbor, Washington]], Johnson was raised in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]]. He graduated from [[New Mexico State University]] in 1981 before embarking on a career in software development. Johnson first worked at a systems engineer at [[IBM]] during the late-1980s, before moving to [[Microsoft]] in 1992 to working in global technical support. After one of his earliest clients, Starbucks, needed [[Wireless|wireless internet]] in their stores, Johnson first met Schultz. Working closely with Microsoft CEO [[Steve Ballmer|Steve Balmer]] and founder [[Bill Gates]], Johnson oversaw strategy for Microsoft and the firm's online search and advertising strategy. Johnson left Microsoft during the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2007-08 financial crisis]] to serve as chief executive of [[Juniper Networks]] from September 2008 to January 2014.

Johnson first joined Starbucks in September 2009 as a board member after which Schultz asked him to take a greater role at the firm. He was subsequently appointed chief operating officer for two years before becoming chief executive. Under his tenure, Starbucks has streamlined its core business, managed corporate programs to address [[Racism in the United States|racial inequality in the U.S.]], and revamped its product suite [[Horizontal integration|horizontally]], particularly in espresso machine manufacturing and technological innovation. <!--Leave space for {{TOC}}.-->

Beginning during the [[Chinese economic reform|late 1990s economic boom]], an influx of thousands of African traders and business people, predominantly from [[West Africa]], arrived in Guangzhou and created an African community in the middle of the southern Chinese metropolis.<ref name=\"star\">{{cite news|last=Schiller|first=Bill|title=Big trouble in China's Chocolate City|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/article/674969|newspaper=Toronto Star|accessdate=2010-05-15|date=2009-08-01}}</ref> At 2012, there was an estimation of more than 100,000 Africans living in Guangzhou.<ref>[https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/26/asia/africans-leaving-guangzhou-china/ The African migrants giving up on the Chinese dream], CNN, 2016-06-26</ref> Since 2014, the city's African population has significantly declined due to strict immigration enforcement by Chinese authorities and economic pressures in home countries including depreciation of the [[Nigerian naira]] and [[Angolan kwanza]].<ref name=\"tia\">{{cite news|title=Going east: African migrants head for China|url=http://www.thisisafricaonline.com/News/Going-east-African-migrants-head-for-China|newspaper=This is Africa|date=February 2014|access-date=2014-02-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222154143/http://www.thisisafricaonline.com/News/Going-east-African-migrants-head-for-China|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"cnn\">{{cite news|title=The African migrants giving up on the Chinese dream|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/26/asia/africans-leaving-guangzhou-china/|agency=CNN|date=September 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"cna\">{{cite news|title=African migrants leaving Guangzhou's Little Africa|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/african-migrants-leaving-guangzhou-s-little-africa/3376408.html|agency=Channel NewsAsia|date=December 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"depreciation\">{{cite news |title=Guangzhou to Nigera - Forex Issues |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRzY-MQMdR4 |work=NTAnews24 |date=September 4, 2016}}</ref>

==Neighborhoods==
There are two main areas where Africans live and do business in Guangzhou: Xiaobei and Guangyuanxi, both areas in the centrally located [[Yuexiu District]].<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/>

The area of Xiaobei is near [[Xiaobei station]] and home to several streets catering to African and Middle Eastern residents. Since the area was home to an existing Muslim population from [[Ningxia]] and [[Xinjiang]], many African immigrants, around half of whom are Muslims, congregated around one area of town primarily because of the convenience in finding [[halal food]].<ref name=net2>{{cite news|title=非洲黑人在广州 Black People in Guangzhou|author=Zhen Jinghui|url=http://www.nfcmag.com/articles/1648/page/1|accessdate=2011-09-06|newspaper=Nanfengchuang|date=2009-09-11}}</ref> Owing to the neighborhood's history there are slightly more Muslim Africans than Christian Africans in Xiaobei.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/> The nerve center of the area is Baohan Straight Street where there are African orientated shops and restaurants.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/> The street was repaved in 2015 and many of the hawkers have departed or set up shops.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/>

About 2 miles from Xiaobei and north of the [[Guangzhou railway station]] is Guangyuanxi, a more business orientated area with a major presence of Nigerian [[Igbo people]].<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/> The area is filled with large trademarts selling shoes, clothing, and other goods.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/> The trademarts are housed in large buildings called Tong Tong Trade Mart, Tian'en Clothing Market, Tangqi Building, Canaan Market, and Ying Fu Building. Since stricter immigration enforcement in the summer of 2013, this area has become much more dormant than before.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/>

==History==
===1990s and 2000s===
Since China's economic boom in the 1990s, thousands of Africans migrated to China; most of these migrants were from West Africa.<ref name=\"star\"/> In Guangzhou, Africans are generally engaged in commerce, visiting or residing in the city because of its wholesale trading markets supplied by nearby factories.<ref name=officials/> During the 2000s, the city's African population rapidly increased with a 2008 news report stating the number of African residents had increased by 30% to 40% annually.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pan|first=Xiaobo|title=Chocolate City - Africans searching for the Chinese Dream|url=http://www.infzm.com/content/6446/0|newspaper=Southern Weekend|date=2008-01-23}}</ref>

===Riots in 2009 and 2012===
Conflict between the African community and police in Guangzhou resulted in riots in 2009 and 2012. In July 2009, two Nigerian men jumped several floors from a building in an attempt to flee Chinese immigration authorities.<ref name=\"death\">{{cite news|title=Africans protest in Guangzhou after passport checks|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-07/16/content_8435559.htm|newspaper=China Daily|date=July 16, 2009}}</ref> Both men were hurt from the fall.<ref name=\"riots\">{{cite news|title=Strike Hard Against Immigration: China's New Exit-Entry Law|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/52973f244.html|work=China Brief|date=November 22, 2013}}</ref> But on hearing rumors of their deaths, hundreds of Africans, mostly Nigerian, surrounded a local police station.<ref name=\"riots\"/> The demonstration escalated into a riot that shut down eight lanes of traffic on a major thoroughfare for several hours.<ref name=\"death\" /><ref name=\"star2\">{{cite news|title=Africans Protest in Guangzhou (Video)|url=https://www.thestar.com/videozone/674349--africans-protest-in-guangzhou|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2009-07-30}}</ref>

In June 2012, an African held in police custody after a taxi fare dispute died after according to police \"suddenly losing consciousness\".<ref name=\"protest\">{{cite news|title=Protest in China over Guangzhou death in custody|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-18516876|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 June 2012}}</ref> Over a hundred Africans gathered at the police station in question demanding the know the cause of death. Guangzhou police responded with a statement that they would \"investigate and settle this case strictly by law\" and also that \"All should abide by the law of China, no one should harm public interests or damage public order.\"<ref name=\"protest\" />

===Stricter immigration enforcement===
A large scale immigration enforcement sweep was conducted by local police in July–August 2013.<ref name=\"mathews\">{{cite book|last1=Mathews|first1=Gordon|last2=Lin|first2=Linessa Dan|last3=Yang|first3=Yang|title=The World in Guangzhou|date=2017|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=118}}</ref> Media reports have reported a decline in the local African population since 2014 with stricter immigration cited as one of the reasons.<ref name=\"tia\"/><ref name=cnn/>

The system of immigration that had been in place since 2013 in Yuexiu District appeared to undergo change in summer 2018 with media reports that several low cost hotels and apartments in the area had prohibited African guests or singled out passport holders from [[Uganda]] and [[Nigeria]], and shops and restaurants catering to Africans had been closed.<ref name=\"supchina\">{{cite news |title='Not Allowed To Receive African Guests': Discrimination At Guangzhou Hotels |url=https://supchina.com/2018/08/08/not-allowed-to-receive-african-guests-discrimination-at-guangzhou-hotels/ |work=supchina |date=August 8, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dailymonitor\">{{cite news |title=China cracks down on Ugandans, Nigerians |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/China-cracks-down--Ugandans--Nigerians/688334-4686402-9ma6epz/index.html |work=Daily Monitor |date=July 29, 2018}}</ref> The Uganda daily ''[[Daily Monitor]]'' spoke to Ugandans in Guangzhou who reported being advised to stay in more costly 4 or 5 star hotels, and other sources for the newspaper claimed the crackdown targeting Ugandans had followed an increasing number of criminal suspects in China charged with drug trafficking holding Ugandan passports, with the suspects allegedly being Nigerian citizens that obtained Ugandan passports through bribing \"rogue\" Ugandan immigration officials.<ref name=\"dailymonitor\"/> A newspaper source described as a \"senior government official\" in Uganda blamed the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Uganda)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] for illegally selling Ugandan passports.<ref name=\"dailymonitor\"/> A spokesperson for the Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control, under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, responded that the Uganda passports were stolen or sold by Ugandan individuals.<ref name=\"dailymonitor\"/>

===Covid-19 epidemic===
On 4 April 2020, it was reported that a Nigerian patient in Guangzhou, who was diagnosed  with [[Covid-19]], did not cooperate with the treatment and injured a nurse in the hospital.<ref name=\"injury\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gd.gov.cn/gdywdt/zwzt/fkyq/gdzxd/content/post_2963657.html|title=一外籍确诊患者在医院打伤护士被立刑事案件|last=|first=|date=2 April 2020|website=gd.gov.cn|publisher=People's Government of Guangdong Province|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> 

On 7 April, Guangzhou government notified five Nigerians who had a positive result on the coronavirus test.

He also claimed in the regular press conference on 13 April that China will attach the \"African friends’ concerns\" by adopting a series of measures to avoid racist and discrimination problems, and condemned \"the US had better focus on domestic efforts to contain the spread of the virus.

==Immigration issues==
Some Africans have applied for permanent residency or work permits, but they are the minority. Many are traders on [[tourist visa]]s engaged in import-export between China and Africa.<ref name=star/>

Many Africans in Guangzhou have overstayed their visas or are using false [[passport]]s{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}, causing local police to conduct frequent visa inspections. Some Africans say that overstaying in China is inevitable because it is impossible to finish off the business they had come for within a 30-day time frame and they cannot afford a plane ticket home.<ref name=star/> Sociologists Gordon Mathews, Linessa Dan Lin, Yang Yang in a study of the local African community note that Nigerians, particularly [[Igbos]], are much more likely than other African groups to stay illegally due to \"masculine pride\".<ref name=\"mathews\"/> Based on field interviews, Igbos report being under greater pressure from family and peers to become a success to justify a trip to China.<ref name=\"mathews\"/>

==Foreign exchange difficulties==
In addition to immigration enforcement, another difficulty to navigate for African traders has been the depreciation of several African currencies after the [[2010s oil glut|fall]] in oil prices since 2014.<ref name=\"ft\">{{cite news |title=Commodity dip hits China's little Africa |url=https://www.ft.com/content/74a878fc-3b68-11e6-93e1-426e2e7bb8ad |work=Financial Times |date=July 4, 2016}}</ref> Nigerian traders who are a large part of the African contingent reported being stymied by the difficulty of obtaining foreign currency in Nigeria needed to purchase goods.<ref name=\"depreciation\"/> The Nigerian government had initially reacted to the sharp depreciation in the [[Nigerian naira]] by limiting access to foreign exchange and refusing to devalue the official [[exchange rate]].<ref name=\"ft\"/> In order to obtain naira, Nigerian traders had to resort to the black market to buy dollars at a 75% premium, making it difficult to turn a profit.<ref name=\"depreciation\"/><ref name=\"ft\"/> The foreign exchange problem proved so discouraging that one long time Nigerian clothing trader in Guangzhou interviewed by the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported being unable to fill a single container so far into the year in the middle of 2016.<ref name=\"ft\"/> Difficulties were reported by traders with foreign exchange in other African countries including Angola, another top oil producer.<ref name=\"depreciation\"/>

The Guangzhou Public Security Bureau carried out a major drug bust with 1,300 police officers raiding the Lihua Hotel (Dragon Hotel) in the city's [[Yuexiu District]]. The August 2013 raid coincided with an immigration enforcement crackdown in the summer 2013 and led to the arrest of 168 suspects, most of whom were described by police as citizens of Nigeria and Mali.<ref>{{cite news|title=Guangzhou police smash West African-led drugs ring|url=http://www.dongguantoday.com/news/guangdong/201308/t20130815_2526371.shtml|newspaper=Dongguan Today|date=2013-08-15}}</ref> The then Nigerian Ambassador in Beijing, Sola Onadipe, stated that more than 50 of the suspects arrested were holders of Nigerian passports.

Beginning during the [[Chinese economic reform|late 1990s economic boom]], an influx of thousands of African traders and business people, predominantly from [[West Africa]], arrived in Guangzhou and created an African community in the middle of the southern Chinese metropolis.<ref name=\"star\">{{cite news|last=Schiller|first=Bill|title=Big trouble in China's Chocolate City|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/article/674969|newspaper=Toronto Star|accessdate=2010-05-15|date=2009-08-01}}</ref> At 2012, there was an estimation of more than 100,000 Africans living in Guangzhou.<ref>[https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/26/asia/africans-leaving-guangzhou-china/ The African migrants giving up on the Chinese dream], CNN, 2016-06-26</ref> Since 2014, the city's African population has significantly declined due to strict immigration enforcement by Chinese authorities and economic pressures in home countries including depreciation of the [[Nigerian naira]] and [[Angolan kwanza]].<ref name=\"tia\">{{cite news|title=Going east: African migrants head for China|url=http://www.thisisafricaonline.com/News/Going-east-African-migrants-head-for-China|newspaper=This is Africa|date=February 2014|access-date=2014-02-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222154143/http://www.thisisafricaonline.com/News/Going-east-African-migrants-head-for-China|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"cnn\">{{cite news|title=The African migrants giving up on the Chinese dream|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/26/asia/africans-leaving-guangzhou-china/|agency=CNN|date=September 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"cna\">{{cite news|title=African migrants leaving Guangzhou's Little Africa|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/african-migrants-leaving-guangzhou-s-little-africa/3376408.html|agency=Channel NewsAsia|date=December 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"depreciation\">{{cite news |title=Guangzhou to Nigera - Forex Issues |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRzY-MQMdR4 |work=NTAnews24 |date=September 4, 2016}}</ref>

==Neighborhoods==
There are two main areas where Africans live and do business in Guangzhou: Xiaobei and Guangyuanxi, both areas in the centrally located [[Yuexiu District]].<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/>

The area of Xiaobei is near [[Xiaobei station]] and home to several streets catering to African and Middle Eastern residents. Since the area was home to an existing Muslim population from [[Ningxia]] and [[Xinjiang]], many African immigrants, around half of whom are Muslims, congregated around one area of town primarily because of the convenience in finding [[halal food]].<ref name=net2>{{cite news|title=非洲黑人在广州 Black People in Guangzhou|author=Zhen Jinghui|url=http://www.nfcmag.com/articles/1648/page/1|accessdate=2011-09-06|newspaper=Nanfengchuang|date=2009-09-11}}</ref> Owing to the neighborhood's history there are slightly more Muslim Africans than Christian Africans in Xiaobei.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/> The nerve center of the area is Baohan Straight Street where there are African orientated shops and restaurants.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/> The street was repaved in 2015 and many of the hawkers have departed or set up shops.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/>

About 2 miles from Xiaobei and north of the [[Guangzhou railway station]] is Guangyuanxi, a more business orientated area with a major presence of Nigerian [[Igbo people]].<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/> The area is filled with large trademarts selling shoes, clothing, and other goods.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/> The trademarts are housed in large buildings called Tong Tong Trade Mart, Tian'en Clothing Market, Tangqi Building, Canaan Market, and Ying Fu Building. Since stricter immigration enforcement in the summer of 2013, this area has become much more dormant than before.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/>

==History==
===1990s and 2000s===
Since China's economic boom in the 1990s, thousands of Africans migrated to China; most of these migrants were from West Africa.<ref name=\"star\"/> In Guangzhou, Africans are generally engaged in commerce, visiting or residing in the city because of its wholesale trading markets supplied by nearby factories.<ref name=officials/> During the 2000s, the city's African population rapidly increased with a 2008 news report stating the number of African residents had increased by 30% to 40% annually.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pan|first=Xiaobo|title=Chocolate City - Africans searching for the Chinese Dream|url=http://www.infzm.com/content/6446/0|newspaper=Southern Weekend|date=2008-01-23}}</ref>

===Riots in 2009 and 2012===
Conflict between the African community and police in Guangzhou resulted in riots in 2009 and 2012. In July 2009, two Nigerian men jumped several floors from a building in an attempt to flee Chinese immigration authorities.<ref name=\"death\">{{cite news|title=Africans protest in Guangzhou after passport checks|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-07/16/content_8435559.htm|newspaper=China Daily|date=July 16, 2009}}</ref> Both men were hurt from the fall.<ref name=\"riots\">{{cite news|title=Strike Hard Against Immigration: China's New Exit-Entry Law|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/52973f244.html|work=China Brief|date=November 22, 2013}}</ref> But on hearing rumors of their deaths, hundreds of Africans, mostly Nigerian, surrounded a local police station.<ref name=\"riots\"/> The demonstration escalated into a riot that shut down eight lanes of traffic on a major thoroughfare for several hours.<ref name=\"death\" /><ref name=\"star2\">{{cite news|title=Africans Protest in Guangzhou (Video)|url=https://www.thestar.com/videozone/674349--africans-protest-in-guangzhou|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2009-07-30}}</ref>

In June 2012, an African held in police custody after a taxi fare dispute died after according to police \"suddenly losing consciousness\".<ref name=\"protest\">{{cite news|title=Protest in China over Guangzhou death in custody|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-18516876|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 June 2012}}</ref> Over a hundred Africans gathered at the police station in question demanding the know the cause of death. Guangzhou police responded with a statement that they would \"investigate and settle this case strictly by law\" and also that \"All should abide by the law of China, no one should harm public interests or damage public order.\"<ref name=\"protest\" />

===Stricter immigration enforcement===
A large scale immigration enforcement sweep was conducted by local police in July–August 2013.<ref name=\"mathews\">{{cite book|last1=Mathews|first1=Gordon|last2=Lin|first2=Linessa Dan|last3=Yang|first3=Yang|title=The World in Guangzhou|date=2017|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=118}}</ref> Media reports have reported a decline in the local African population since 2014 with stricter immigration cited as one of the reasons.<ref name=\"tia\"/><ref name=cnn/>

The system of immigration that had been in place since 2013 in Yuexiu District appeared to undergo change in summer 2018 with media reports that several low cost hotels and apartments in the area had prohibited African guests or singled out passport holders from [[Uganda]] and [[Nigeria]], and shops and restaurants catering to Africans had been closed.<ref name=\"supchina\">{{cite news |title='Not Allowed To Receive African Guests': Discrimination At Guangzhou Hotels |url=https://supchina.com/2018/08/08/not-allowed-to-receive-african-guests-discrimination-at-guangzhou-hotels/ |work=supchina |date=August 8, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dailymonitor\">{{cite news |title=China cracks down on Ugandans, Nigerians |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/China-cracks-down--Ugandans--Nigerians/688334-4686402-9ma6epz/index.html |work=Daily Monitor |date=July 29, 2018}}</ref> The Uganda daily ''[[Daily Monitor]]'' spoke to Ugandans in Guangzhou who reported being advised to stay in more costly 4 or 5 star hotels, and other sources for the newspaper claimed the crackdown targeting Ugandans had followed an increasing number of criminal suspects in China charged with drug trafficking holding Ugandan passports, with the suspects allegedly being Nigerian citizens that obtained Ugandan passports through bribing \"rogue\" Ugandan immigration officials.<ref name=\"dailymonitor\"/> A newspaper source described as a \"senior government official\" in Uganda blamed the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Uganda)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] for illegally selling Ugandan passports.<ref name=\"dailymonitor\"/> A spokesperson for the Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control, under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, responded that the Uganda passports were stolen or sold by Ugandan individuals.<ref name=\"dailymonitor\"/>

===Covid-19 epidemic===
On 4 April 2020, it was reported that a Nigerian patient in Guangzhou, who diagnosed [[Covid-19]], did not cooperate with the treatment, and injured a nurse in the hospital.<ref name=\"injury\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gd.gov.cn/gdywdt/zwzt/fkyq/gdzxd/content/post_2963657.html|title=一外籍确诊患者在医院打伤护士被立刑事案件|last=|first=|date=2 April 2020|website=gd.gov.cn|publisher=People's Government of Guangdong Province|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> 

On 7 April, Guangzhou government notified 5 Nigerians who had a positive result on the coronavirus test. The government also claimed that, because of the risk of cluster infections of the African communities, Guangdong Province has raised the risk of outbreaks into an intermediate level of [[Yuexiu District]] and [[Baiyun District, Guangzhou|Baiyun District]] in Guangzhou City, where the Africans usually inhabit. <ref name=\"storm\">{{Cite news|last=蔡|first=娪嫣|url=https://www.storm.mg/article/2510017|title=疫情讓中國人更歧視黑人？廣州大量非裔人士流落街頭　遭房東趕出家門、找旅館投宿也碰壁|date=12 April 2020|work=The Storm Media|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> A large number of Africans had been evicted from flats and hotels by landlords, and they also had difficulty on finding food and shelter.

He also claimed in the regular press conference on 13 April that China will attach the \"African friends’ concerns\" by adopting a series of measures to avoid racist and discrimination problems, and condemned \"the US had better focus on domestic efforts to contain the spread of the virus.

==Immigration issues==
Some Africans have applied for permanent residency or work permits, but they are the minority. Many are traders on [[tourist visa]]s engaged in import-export between China and Africa.<ref name=star/>

Many Africans in Guangzhou have overstayed their visas or are using false [[passport]]s{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}, causing local police to conduct frequent visa inspections. Some Africans say that overstaying in China is inevitable because it is impossible to finish off the business they had come for within a 30-day time frame and they cannot afford a plane ticket home.<ref name=star/> Sociologists Gordon Mathews, Linessa Dan Lin, Yang Yang in a study of the local African community note that Nigerians, particularly [[Igbos]], are much more likely than other African groups to stay illegally due to \"masculine pride\".<ref name=\"mathews\"/> Based on field interviews, Igbos report being under greater pressure from family and peers to become a success to justify a trip to China.<ref name=\"mathews\"/>

==Foreign exchange difficulties==
In addition to immigration enforcement, another difficulty to navigate for African traders has been the depreciation of several African currencies after the [[2010s oil glut|fall]] in oil prices since 2014.<ref name=\"ft\">{{cite news |title=Commodity dip hits China's little Africa |url=https://www.ft.com/content/74a878fc-3b68-11e6-93e1-426e2e7bb8ad |work=Financial Times |date=July 4, 2016}}</ref> Nigerian traders who are a large part of the African contingent reported being stymied by the difficulty of obtaining foreign currency in Nigeria needed to purchase goods.<ref name=\"depreciation\"/> The Nigerian government had initially reacted to the sharp depreciation in the [[Nigerian naira]] by limiting access to foreign exchange and refusing to devalue the official [[exchange rate]].<ref name=\"ft\"/> In order to obtain naira, Nigerian traders had to resort to the black market to buy dollars at a 75% premium, making it difficult to turn a profit.<ref name=\"depreciation\"/><ref name=\"ft\"/> The foreign exchange problem proved so discouraging that one long time Nigerian clothing trader in Guangzhou interviewed by the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported being unable to fill a single container so far into the year in the middle of 2016.<ref name=\"ft\"/> Difficulties were reported by traders with foreign exchange in other African countries including Angola, another top oil producer.<ref name=\"depreciation\"/>

The Guangzhou Public Security Bureau carried out a major drug bust with 1,300 police officers raiding the Lihua Hotel (Dragon Hotel) in the city's [[Yuexiu District]]. The August 2013 raid coincided with an immigration enforcement crackdown in the summer 2013 and led to the arrest of 168 suspects, most of whom were described by police as citizens of Nigeria and Mali.<ref>{{cite news|title=Guangzhou police smash West African-led drugs ring|url=http://www.dongguantoday.com/news/guangdong/201308/t20130815_2526371.shtml|newspaper=Dongguan Today|date=2013-08-15}}</ref> The then Nigerian Ambassador in Beijing, Sola Onadipe, stated that more than 50 of the suspects arrested were holders of Nigerian passports.

'''Africans in Guangzhou''' ({{zh|s=广州非裔|t=廣州非裔}}, more commonly {{zh|s=广州黑人|t=廣州黑人|l=Black people in Guangzhou|labels=no}}) are [[Emigration from Africa|Africans]] who travel to or reside in [[Guangzhou]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] for short and long term periods.

Beginning during the [[Chinese economic reform|late 1990s economic boom]], an influx of thousands of African traders and business people, predominantly from [[West Africa]], arrived in Guangzhou and created an African community in the middle of the southern Chinese metropolis.<ref name=\"star\">{{cite news|last=Schiller|first=Bill|title=Big trouble in China's Chocolate City|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/article/674969|newspaper=Toronto Star|accessdate=2010-05-15|date=2009-08-01}}</ref> At 2012, there was an estimation of more than 100,000 Africans living in Guangzhou.<ref>[https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/26/asia/africans-leaving-guangzhou-china/ The African migrants giving up on the Chinese dream], CNN, 2016-06-26</ref> Since 2014, the city's African population has significantly declined due to strict immigration enforcement by Chinese authorities and economic pressures in home countries including depreciation of the [[Nigerian naira]] and [[Angolan kwanza]].<ref name=\"tia\">{{cite news|title=Going east: African migrants head for China|url=http://www.thisisafricaonline.com/News/Going-east-African-migrants-head-for-China|newspaper=This is Africa|date=February 2014|access-date=2014-02-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222154143/http://www.thisisafricaonline.com/News/Going-east-African-migrants-head-for-China|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"cnn\">{{cite news|title=The African migrants giving up on the Chinese dream|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/26/asia/africans-leaving-guangzhou-china/|agency=CNN|date=September 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"cna\">{{cite news|title=African migrants leaving Guangzhou's Little Africa|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/african-migrants-leaving-guangzhou-s-little-africa/3376408.html|agency=Channel NewsAsia|date=December 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"depreciation\">{{cite news |title=Guangzhou to Nigera - Forex Issues |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRzY-MQMdR4 |work=NTAnews24 |date=September 4, 2016}}</ref>

==Neighborhoods==
There are two main areas where Africans live and do business in Guangzhou: Xiaobei and Guangyuanxi, both areas in the centrally located [[Yuexiu District]].<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/>

The area of Xiaobei is near [[Xiaobei station]] and home to several streets catering to African and Middle Eastern residents. Since the area was home to an existing Muslim population from [[Ningxia]] and [[Xinjiang]], many African immigrants, around half of whom are Muslims, congregated around one area of town primarily because of the convenience in finding [[halal food]].<ref name=net2>{{cite news|title=非洲黑人在广州 Black People in Guangzhou|author=Zhen Jinghui|url=http://www.nfcmag.com/articles/1648/page/1|accessdate=2011-09-06|newspaper=Nanfengchuang|date=2009-09-11}}</ref> Owing to the neighborhood's history there are slightly more Muslim Africans than Christian Africans in Xiaobei.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/> The nerve center of the area is Baohan Straight Street where there are African orientated shops and restaurants.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/> The street was repaved in 2015 and many of the hawkers have departed or set up shops.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/>

About 2 miles from Xiaobei and north of the [[Guangzhou railway station]] is Guangyuanxi, a more business orientated area with a major presence of Nigerian [[Igbo people]].<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/> The area is filled with large trademarts selling shoes, clothing, and other goods.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/> The trademarts are housed in large buildings called Tong Tong Trade Mart, Tian'en Clothing Market, Tangqi Building, Canaan Market, and Ying Fu Building. Since stricter immigration enforcement in the summer of 2013, this area has become much more dormant than before.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/>

==History==
===1990s and 2000s===
Since China's economic boom in the 1990s, thousands of Africans migrated to China; most of these migrants were from West Africa.<ref name=\"star\"/> In Guangzhou, Africans are generally engaged in commerce, visiting or residing in the city because of its wholesale trading markets supplied by nearby factories.<ref name=officials/> During the 2000s, the city's African population rapidly increased with a 2008 news report stating the number of African residents had increased by 30% to 40% annually.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pan|first=Xiaobo|title=Chocolate City - Africans searching for the Chinese Dream|url=http://www.infzm.com/content/6446/0|newspaper=Southern Weekend|date=2008-01-23}}</ref>

===Riots in 2009 and 2012===
Conflict between the African community and police in Guangzhou resulted in riots in 2009 and 2012. In July 2009, two Nigerian men jumped several floors from a building in an attempt to flee Chinese immigration authorities.<ref name=\"death\">{{cite news|title=Africans protest in Guangzhou after passport checks|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-07/16/content_8435559.htm|newspaper=China Daily|date=July 16, 2009}}</ref> Both men were hurt from the fall.<ref name=\"riots\">{{cite news|title=Strike Hard Against Immigration: China's New Exit-Entry Law|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/52973f244.html|work=China Brief|date=November 22, 2013}}</ref> But on hearing rumors of their deaths, hundreds of Africans, mostly Nigerian, surrounded a local police station.<ref name=\"riots\"/> The demonstration escalated into a riot that shut down eight lanes of traffic on a major thoroughfare for several hours.<ref name=\"death\" /><ref name=\"star2\">{{cite news|title=Africans Protest in Guangzhou (Video)|url=https://www.thestar.com/videozone/674349--africans-protest-in-guangzhou|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2009-07-30}}</ref>

In June 2012, an African held in police custody after a taxi fare dispute died after according to police \"suddenly losing consciousness\".<ref name=\"protest\">{{cite news|title=Protest in China over Guangzhou death in custody|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-18516876|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 June 2012}}</ref> Over a hundred Africans gathered at the police station in question demanding the know the cause of death. Guangzhou police responded with a statement that they would \"investigate and settle this case strictly by law\" and also that \"All should abide by the law of China, no one should harm public interests or damage public order.\"<ref name=\"protest\" />

===Stricter immigration enforcement===
A large scale immigration enforcement sweep was conducted by local police in July–August 2013.<ref name=\"mathews\">{{cite book|last1=Mathews|first1=Gordon|last2=Lin|first2=Linessa Dan|last3=Yang|first3=Yang|title=The World in Guangzhou|date=2017|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=118}}</ref> Media reports have reported a decline in the local African population since 2014 with stricter immigration cited as one of the reasons.<ref name=\"tia\"/><ref name=cnn/>

The system of immigration that had been in place since 2013 in Yuexiu District appeared to undergo change in summer 2018 with media reports that several low cost hotels and apartments in the area had prohibited African guests or singled out passport holders from [[Uganda]] and [[Nigeria]], and shops and restaurants catering to Africans had been closed.<ref name=\"supchina\">{{cite news |title='Not Allowed To Receive African Guests': Discrimination At Guangzhou Hotels |url=https://supchina.com/2018/08/08/not-allowed-to-receive-african-guests-discrimination-at-guangzhou-hotels/ |work=supchina |date=August 8, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dailymonitor\">{{cite news |title=China cracks down on Ugandans, Nigerians |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/China-cracks-down--Ugandans--Nigerians/688334-4686402-9ma6epz/index.html |work=Daily Monitor |date=July 29, 2018}}</ref> The Uganda daily ''[[Daily Monitor]]'' spoke to Ugandans in Guangzhou who reported being advised to stay in more costly 4 or 5 star hotels, and other sources for the newspaper claimed the crackdown targeting Ugandans had followed an increasing number of criminal suspects in China charged with drug trafficking holding Ugandan passports, with the suspects allegedly being Nigerian citizens that obtained Ugandan passports through bribing \"rogue\" Ugandan immigration officials.<ref name=\"dailymonitor\"/> A newspaper source described as a \"senior government official\" in Uganda blamed the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Uganda)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] for illegally selling Ugandan passports.<ref name=\"dailymonitor\"/> A spokesperson for the Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control, under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, responded that the Uganda passports were stolen or sold by Ugandan individuals.<ref name=\"dailymonitor\"/>

===Covid-19 epidemic===
On 4 April 2020, it was reported that a Nigerian patient in Guangzhou, who diagnosed [[Covid-19]], did not cooperate with the treatment, and injured a nurse in the hospital.<ref name=\"injury\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gd.gov.cn/gdywdt/zwzt/fkyq/gdzxd/content/post_2963657.html|title=一外籍确诊患者在医院打伤护士被立刑事案件|last=|first=|date=2 April 2020|website=gd.gov.cn|publisher=People's Government of Guangdong Province|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> 

On 7 April, Guangzhou government notified 5 Nigerians who had a positive result on the coronavirus test. The government also claimed that, because of the risk of cluster infections of the African communities, Guangdong Province has raised the risk of outbreaks into an intermediate level of [[Yuexiu District]] and [[Baiyun District, Guangzhou|Baiyun District]] in Guangzhou City, where the Africans usually inhabit. <ref name=\"storm\">{{Cite news|last=蔡|first=娪嫣|url=https://www.storm.mg/article/2510017|title=疫情讓中國人更歧視黑人？廣州大量非裔人士流落街頭　遭房東趕出家門、找旅館投宿也碰壁|date=12 April 2020|work=The Storm Media|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> A large number of Africans had been evicted from flats and hotels by landlords, and they also had difficulty on finding food and shelter.

On 11 April, the [[Consulate General of the United States, Guangzhou|US Consulate General Guangzhou]] warned the African-Americans to avoid travel to the Guangzhou city, with a report by some African-Americans that \"some businesses and hotels refuse to do business with them\".<ref name=\"cnn2\"/> The Consulate further raised a travelling warning to announce the discrimination condition against African-Americans in Guangzhou on 13 April. In that warning, it said that Chinese officials might require Africans to participate in the Covid-19 test and undergo a 14-day supervised quarantine at their own expense.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://china.usembassy-china.org.cn/health-alert-u-s-consulate-general-guangzhou-peoples-republic-of-china/|title=Health Alert: U.S. Consulate General Guangzhou, People’s Republic of China|date=2020-04-13|website=U.S. Embassy & Consulates in China|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

He also claimed in the regular press conference on 13 April that China will attach the \"African friends’ concerns\" by adopting a series of measures to avoid racist and discrimination problems, and condemned \"the US had better focus on domestic efforts to contain the spread of the virus.

==Immigration issues==
Some Africans have applied for permanent residency or work permits, but they are the minority. Many are traders on [[tourist visa]]s engaged in import-export between China and Africa.<ref name=star/>

Many Africans in Guangzhou have overstayed their visas or are using false [[passport]]s{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}, causing local police to conduct frequent visa inspections. Some Africans say that overstaying in China is inevitable because it is impossible to finish off the business they had come for within a 30-day time frame and they cannot afford a plane ticket home.<ref name=star/> Sociologists Gordon Mathews, Linessa Dan Lin, Yang Yang in a study of the local African community note that Nigerians, particularly [[Igbos]], are much more likely than other African groups to stay illegally due to \"masculine pride\".<ref name=\"mathews\"/> Based on field interviews, Igbos report being under greater pressure from family and peers to become a success to justify a trip to China.<ref name=\"mathews\"/>

==Foreign exchange difficulties==
In addition to immigration enforcement, another difficulty to navigate for African traders has been the depreciation of several African currencies after the [[2010s oil glut|fall]] in oil prices since 2014.<ref name=\"ft\">{{cite news |title=Commodity dip hits China's little Africa |url=https://www.ft.com/content/74a878fc-3b68-11e6-93e1-426e2e7bb8ad |work=Financial Times |date=July 4, 2016}}</ref> Nigerian traders who are a large part of the African contingent reported being stymied by the difficulty of obtaining foreign currency in Nigeria needed to purchase goods.<ref name=\"depreciation\"/> The Nigerian government had initially reacted to the sharp depreciation in the [[Nigerian naira]] by limiting access to foreign exchange and refusing to devalue the official [[exchange rate]].<ref name=\"ft\"/> In order to obtain naira, Nigerian traders had to resort to the black market to buy dollars at a 75% premium, making it difficult to turn a profit.<ref name=\"depreciation\"/><ref name=\"ft\"/> The foreign exchange problem proved so discouraging that one long time Nigerian clothing trader in Guangzhou interviewed by the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported being unable to fill a single container so far into the year in the middle of 2016.<ref name=\"ft\"/> Difficulties were reported by traders with foreign exchange in other African countries including Angola, another top oil producer.<ref name=\"depreciation\"/>

The Guangzhou Public Security Bureau carried out a major drug bust with 1,300 police officers raiding the Lihua Hotel (Dragon Hotel) in the city's [[Yuexiu District]]. The August 2013 raid coincided with an immigration enforcement crackdown in the summer 2013 and led to the arrest of 168 suspects, most of whom were described by police as citizens of Nigeria and Mali.<ref>{{cite news|title=Guangzhou police smash West African-led drugs ring|url=http://www.dongguantoday.com/news/guangdong/201308/t20130815_2526371.shtml|newspaper=Dongguan Today|date=2013-08-15}}</ref> The then Nigerian Ambassador in Beijing, Sola Onadipe, stated that more than 50 of the suspects arrested were holders of Nigerian passports.

Beginning during the [[Chinese economic reform|late 1990s economic boom]], an influx of thousands of African traders and business people, predominantly from [[West Africa]], arrived in Guangzhou and created an African community in the middle of the southern Chinese metropolis.<ref name=\"star\">{{cite news|last=Schiller|first=Bill|title=Big trouble in China's Chocolate City|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/article/674969|newspaper=Toronto Star|accessdate=2010-05-15|date=2009-08-01}}</ref> At 2012, there was an estimation of more than 100,000 Africans living in Guangzhou.<ref>[https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/26/asia/africans-leaving-guangzhou-china/ The African migrants giving up on the Chinese dream], CNN, 2016-06-26</ref> Since 2014, the city's African population has significantly declined due to strict immigration enforcement by Chinese authorities and economic pressures in home countries including depreciation of the [[Nigerian naira]] and [[Angolan kwanza]].<ref name=\"tia\">{{cite news|title=Going east: African migrants head for China|url=http://www.thisisafricaonline.com/News/Going-east-African-migrants-head-for-China|newspaper=This is Africa|date=February 2014|access-date=2014-02-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222154143/http://www.thisisafricaonline.com/News/Going-east-African-migrants-head-for-China|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"cnn\">{{cite news|title=The African migrants giving up on the Chinese dream|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/26/asia/africans-leaving-guangzhou-china/|agency=CNN|date=September 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"cna\">{{cite news|title=African migrants leaving Guangzhou's Little Africa|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/african-migrants-leaving-guangzhou-s-little-africa/3376408.html|agency=Channel NewsAsia|date=December 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"depreciation\">{{cite news |title=Guangzhou to Nigera - Forex Issues |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRzY-MQMdR4 |work=NTAnews24 |date=September 4, 2016}}</ref>

According to the city, there were 16,000 Africans including North Africans residing in Guangzhou.<ref name=officials>{{cite news|last1=Zhuang|first1=Pinghui|title=Guangzhou clarifies size of African community amid fears over Ebola virus|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1629415/guangzhou-clarifies-size-african-community-amid-fears-over-ebola-virus|date=November 1, 2014}}</ref> Of these residents, 4,000 were long term residents, which is defined by city officials as living for longer than 6 months in the city.<ref name=yen>{{cite news|title=在广州居住外国人达11.8万 日本人最多韩国居次|url=http://www.ycwb.com/ePaper/xkb/html/2014-12/01/content_592212.htm|newspaper=Yangcheng Evening News|access-date=2015-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203093224/http://www.ycwb.com/ePaper/xkb/html/2014-12/01/content_592212.htm|archive-date=2015-02-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Neighborhoods==
There are two main areas where Africans live and do business in Guangzhou: Xiaobei and Guangyuanxi, both areas in the centrally located [[Yuexiu District]].<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/>

The area of Xiaobei is near [[Xiaobei station]] and home to several streets catering to African and Middle Eastern residents. Since the area was home to an existing Muslim population from [[Ningxia]] and [[Xinjiang]], many African immigrants, around half of whom are Muslims, congregated around one area of town primarily because of the convenience in finding [[halal food]].<ref name=net2>{{cite news|title=非洲黑人在广州 Black People in Guangzhou|author=Zhen Jinghui|url=http://www.nfcmag.com/articles/1648/page/1|accessdate=2011-09-06|newspaper=Nanfengchuang|date=2009-09-11}}</ref> Owing to the neighborhood's history there are slightly more Muslim Africans than Christian Africans in Xiaobei.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/> The nerve center of the area is Baohan Straight Street where there are African orientated shops and restaurants.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/> The street was repaved in 2015 and many of the hawkers have departed or set up shops.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/>

About 2 miles from Xiaobei and north of the [[Guangzhou railway station]] is Guangyuanxi, a more business orientated area with a major presence of Nigerian [[Igbo people]].<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/> The area is filled with large trademarts selling shoes, clothing, and other goods.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/> The trademarts are housed in large buildings called Tong Tong Trade Mart, Tian'en Clothing Market, Tangqi Building, Canaan Market, and Ying Fu Building. Since stricter immigration enforcement in the summer of 2013, this area has become much more dormant than before.<ref name=\"neighborhoods\"/>

==History==
===1990s and 2000s===
Since China's economic boom in the 1990s, thousands of Africans migrated to China; most of these migrants were from West Africa.<ref name=\"star\"/> In Guangzhou, Africans are generally engaged in commerce, visiting or residing in the city because of its wholesale trading markets supplied by nearby factories.<ref name=officials/> During the 2000s, the city's African population rapidly increased with a 2008 news report stating the number of African residents had increased by 30% to 40% annually.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pan|first=Xiaobo|title=Chocolate City - Africans searching for the Chinese Dream|url=http://www.infzm.com/content/6446/0|newspaper=Southern Weekend|date=2008-01-23}}</ref>

===Riots in 2009 and 2012===
Conflict between the African community and police in Guangzhou resulted in riots in 2009 and 2012. In July 2009, two Nigerian men jumped several floors from a building in an attempt to flee Chinese immigration authorities.<ref name=\"death\">{{cite news|title=Africans protest in Guangzhou after passport checks|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-07/16/content_8435559.htm|newspaper=China Daily|date=July 16, 2009}}</ref> Both men were hurt from the fall.<ref name=\"riots\">{{cite news|title=Strike Hard Against Immigration: China's New Exit-Entry Law|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/52973f244.html|work=China Brief|date=November 22, 2013}}</ref> But on hearing rumors of their deaths, hundreds of Africans, mostly Nigerian, surrounded a local police station.<ref name=\"riots\"/> The demonstration escalated into a riot that shut down eight lanes of traffic on a major thoroughfare for several hours.<ref name=\"death\" /><ref name=\"star2\">{{cite news|title=Africans Protest in Guangzhou (Video)|url=https://www.thestar.com/videozone/674349--africans-protest-in-guangzhou|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2009-07-30}}</ref>

In June 2012, an African held in police custody after a taxi fare dispute died after according to police \"suddenly losing consciousness\".<ref name=\"protest\">{{cite news|title=Protest in China over Guangzhou death in custody|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-18516876|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 June 2012}}</ref> Over a hundred Africans gathered at the police station in question demanding the know the cause of death. Guangzhou police responded with a statement that they would \"investigate and settle this case strictly by law\" and also that \"All should abide by the law of China, no one should harm public interests or damage public order.\"<ref name=\"protest\" />

===Stricter immigration enforcement===
A large scale immigration enforcement sweep was conducted by local police in July–August 2013.<ref name=\"mathews\">{{cite book|last1=Mathews|first1=Gordon|last2=Lin|first2=Linessa Dan|last3=Yang|first3=Yang|title=The World in Guangzhou|date=2017|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=118}}</ref> Media reports have reported a decline in the local African population since 2014 with stricter immigration cited as one of the reasons.<ref name=\"tia\"/><ref name=cnn/>

The system of immigration that had been in place since 2013 in Yuexiu District appeared to undergo change in summer 2018 with media reports that several low cost hotels and apartments in the area had prohibited African guests or singled out passport holders from [[Uganda]] and [[Nigeria]], and shops and restaurants catering to Africans had been closed.<ref name=\"supchina\">{{cite news |title='Not Allowed To Receive African Guests': Discrimination At Guangzhou Hotels |url=https://supchina.com/2018/08/08/not-allowed-to-receive-african-guests-discrimination-at-guangzhou-hotels/ |work=supchina |date=August 8, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dailymonitor\">{{cite news |title=China cracks down on Ugandans, Nigerians |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/China-cracks-down--Ugandans--Nigerians/688334-4686402-9ma6epz/index.html |work=Daily Monitor |date=July 29, 2018}}</ref> The Uganda daily ''[[Daily Monitor]]'' spoke to Ugandans in Guangzhou who reported being advised to stay in more costly 4 or 5 star hotels, and other sources for the newspaper claimed the crackdown targeting Ugandans had followed an increasing number of criminal suspects in China charged with drug trafficking holding Ugandan passports, with the suspects allegedly being Nigerian citizens that obtained Ugandan passports through bribing \"rogue\" Ugandan immigration officials.<ref name=\"dailymonitor\"/> A newspaper source described as a \"senior government official\" in Uganda blamed the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Uganda)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] for illegally selling Ugandan passports.<ref name=\"dailymonitor\"/> A spokesperson for the Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control, under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, responded that the Uganda passports were stolen or sold by Ugandan individuals.<ref name=\"dailymonitor\"/>

===Covid-19 epidemic===
On 4 April 2020, it was reported that a Nigerian patient in Guangzhou, who diagnosed [[Covid-19]], did not cooperate with the treatment, and injured a nurse in the hospital.<ref name=\"injury\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gd.gov.cn/gdywdt/zwzt/fkyq/gdzxd/content/post_2963657.html|title=一外籍确诊患者在医院打伤护士被立刑事案件|last=|first=|date=2 April 2020|website=gd.gov.cn|publisher=People's Government of Guangdong Province|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> 

On 7 April, Guangzhou government notified 5 Nigerians who had a positive result on the coronavirus test. The government also claimed that, because of the risk of cluster infections of the African communities, Guangdong Province has raised the risk of outbreaks into an intermediate level of [[Yuexiu District]] and [[Baiyun District, Guangzhou|Baiyun District]] in Guangzhou City, where the Africans usually inhabit. <ref name=\"storm\">{{Cite news|last=蔡|first=娪嫣|url=https://www.storm.mg/article/2510017|title=疫情讓中國人更歧視黑人？廣州大量非裔人士流落街頭　遭房東趕出家門、找旅館投宿也碰壁|date=12 April 2020|work=The Storm Media|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> A large number of Africans had been evicted from flats and hotels by landlords, and they also had difficulty on finding food and shelter.

On 11 April, the [[Consulate General of the United States, Guangzhou|US Consulate General Guangzhou]] warned the African-Americans to avoid travel to the Guangzhou city, with a report by some African-Americans that \"some businesses and hotels refuse to do business with them\".<ref name=\"cnn2\"/> The Consulate further raised a travelling warning to announce the discrimination condition against African-Americans in Guangzhou on 13 April. In that warning, it said that Chinese officials might require Africans to participate in the Covid-19 test and undergo a 14-day supervised quarantine at their own expense.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://china.usembassy-china.org.cn/health-alert-u-s-consulate-general-guangzhou-peoples-republic-of-china/|title=Health Alert: U.S. Consulate General Guangzhou, People’s Republic of China|date=2020-04-13|website=U.S. Embassy & Consulates in China|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

On 12 April, [[Zhao Lijian]], the spokesperson of [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China]], claimed that:
{{Cquote|During our fight against the coronavirus, the Chinese government has been attaching great importance to the life and health of foreign nationals in China. All foreigners are treated equally.

He also claimed in the regular press conference on 13 April that China will attach the \"African friends’ concerns\" by adopting a series of measures to avoid racist and discrimination problems, and condemned \"the US had better focus on domestic efforts to contain the spread of the virus. Attempts to use the pandemic to drive a wedge between China and Africa are bound to fail\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1769241.shtml|title=Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian's Regular Press Conference on April 13, 2020|last=|first=|date=13 April 2020|website=|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the People's Republic of China|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

==Immigration issues==
Some Africans have applied for permanent residency or work permits, but they are the minority. Many are traders on [[tourist visa]]s engaged in import-export between China and Africa.<ref name=star/>

Many Africans in Guangzhou have overstayed their visas or are using false [[passport]]s{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}, causing local police to conduct frequent visa inspections. Some Africans say that overstaying in China is inevitable because it is impossible to finish off the business they had come for within a 30-day time frame and they cannot afford a plane ticket home.<ref name=star/> Sociologists Gordon Mathews, Linessa Dan Lin, Yang Yang in a study of the local African community note that Nigerians, particularly [[Igbos]], are much more likely than other African groups to stay illegally due to \"masculine pride\".<ref name=\"mathews\"/> Based on field interviews, Igbos report being under greater pressure from family and peers to become a success to justify a trip to China.<ref name=\"mathews\"/>

==Foreign exchange difficulties==
In addition to immigration enforcement, another difficulty to navigate for African traders has been the depreciation of several African currencies after the [[2010s oil glut|fall]] in oil prices since 2014.<ref name=\"ft\">{{cite news |title=Commodity dip hits China's little Africa |url=https://www.ft.com/content/74a878fc-3b68-11e6-93e1-426e2e7bb8ad |work=Financial Times |date=July 4, 2016}}</ref> Nigerian traders who are a large part of the African contingent reported being stymied by the difficulty of obtaining foreign currency in Nigeria needed to purchase goods.<ref name=\"depreciation\"/> The Nigerian government had initially reacted to the sharp depreciation in the [[Nigerian naira]] by limiting access to foreign exchange and refusing to devalue the official [[exchange rate]].<ref name=\"ft\"/> In order to obtain naira, Nigerian traders had to resort to the black market to buy dollars at a 75% premium, making it difficult to turn a profit.<ref name=\"depreciation\"/><ref name=\"ft\"/> The foreign exchange problem proved so discouraging that one long time Nigerian clothing trader in Guangzhou interviewed by the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported being unable to fill a single container so far into the year in the middle of 2016.<ref name=\"ft\"/> Difficulties were reported by traders with foreign exchange in other African countries including Angola, another top oil producer.<ref name=\"depreciation\"/>

==Crime==
Data from Guangdong anti-drug officials indicate that most drug dealers in the province are from Africa or the Middle East.<ref name=07guangzhou946>{{cite journal|title=07GUANGZHOU946_a|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07GUANGZHOU946_a.html|publisher=Wikileaks}}</ref><ref name=drugs>{{cite news|last=Wang|first=Huazhong|title=More foreigners involved in drug trafficking cases|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/photo/2010-06/26/content_10023151.htm|newspaper=China Daily|date=2010-06-26}}</ref> Anti-drug officials quoted by US diplomats in a 2007 diplomatic cable described linguistic difficulties faced by the police in countering African drug dealers, noting some dealers used languages like [[Igbo language|Igbo]], a Nigerian language that police had no capability for understanding.<ref name=07guangzhou946/> A Nigerian consulate official in Guangzhou estimated in 2017 that on average 1% of Nigerians arriving in Guangzhou would be arrested for a drug-related offense.<ref name=\"consulate\">{{cite news |title=535 Nigerians languish in Chinese prisons for drug trafficking |url=https://www.thepointng.com/535-nigerians-languish-in-chinese-prisons-for-drug-trafficking/ |work=The Point |date=May 1, 2017}}</ref>

The Guangzhou Public Security Bureau carried out a major drug bust with 1,300 police officers raiding the Lihua Hotel (Dragon Hotel) in the city's [[Yuexiu District]]. The August 2013 raid coincided with an immigration enforcement crackdown in the summer 2013 and led to the arrest of 168 suspects, most of whom were described by police as citizens of Nigeria and Mali.<ref>{{cite news|title=Guangzhou police smash West African-led drugs ring|url=http://www.dongguantoday.com/news/guangdong/201308/t20130815_2526371.shtml|newspaper=Dongguan Today|date=2013-08-15}}</ref> The then Nigerian Ambassador in Beijing, Sola Onadipe, stated that more than 50 of the suspects arrested were holders of Nigerian passports.

The '''Wow! signal''' was a strong [[narrowband]] [[radio signal]] received on August 15, 1977 by [[Ohio State University]]'s [[Big Ear]] radio telescope in the United States, then used to support the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]]. The signal appeared to come from the direction of the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] and bore the expected hallmarks of [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|extraterrestrial]] origin.

Astronomer Jerry R. Ehman discovered the anomaly a few days later while reviewing the recorded data. He was so impressed by the result that he circled the reading on the computer printout, \"6EQUJ5\", and wrote the comment ''\"Wow!\"'' on its side, leading to the event's widely used name.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126510251|title=Aliens Found In Ohio? The 'Wow!' Signal|last=Krulwich|first=Robert|publisher=[[NPR|National Public Radio]]|date=May 29, 2010|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>

The entire signal sequence lasted for the full 72-second window during which Big Ear was able to observe it, but has not been detected since, despite several subsequent attempts by Ehman and others. Many hypotheses have been advanced on the origin of the emission, including natural and human-made sources, but none of them adequately explain the signal.<ref name=Skeptoid/>

Although the Wow! signal had no detectable [[modulation]]—a technique used to transmit information over radio waves—it remains the strongest candidate for an alien radio transmission ever detected.<ref name=Skeptoid/>

== Background ==
In a 1959 paper, [[Cornell University]] physicists [[Philip Morrison]] and [[Giuseppe Cocconi]] had speculated that any [[extraterrestrial civilization]] attempting to communicate via radio signals might do so using a frequency of {{val|1420}} [[megahertz]] ({{val|21}} [[centimeters]]), which is [[Hydrogen line|naturally emitted by hydrogen]], the most common element in the universe and therefore likely familiar to all technologically advanced civilizations.<ref name=\"Nat Geo\">{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/chasing-ufos/articles/what-is-the-wow-signal/|title=What is the Wow! signal?|last=Kiger|first=Patrick J.|date=2012-06-21|website=National Geographic Channel|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>

In 1973, after completing an extensive [[Ohio Sky Survey|survey of extragalactic radio sources]], Ohio State University assigned the now-defunct [[Ohio State University Radio Observatory]] (nicknamed \"Big Ear\") to the scientific [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI), in the longest-running program of its kind in history. The radio telescope was located near the [[Perkins Observatory]] on the campus of [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in [[Delaware, Ohio]].

By 1977, Ehman was working at the SETI project as a volunteer; his job involved analyzing by hand large amounts of data processed by an [[IBM 1130]] computer and recorded on [[line printer]] paper. While perusing data collected on August 15 at 22:16&nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (02:16&nbsp;[[UTC]]), he spotted a series of values of signal intensity and frequency that left him and his colleagues astonished.<ref name=\"Nat Geo\" />
The event was later documented in technical detail by the observatory's director.<ref name=Kraus>John Kraus, Director, Ohio State Radio Observatory 31, January 1994, [http://jump2.nrao.edu/dbtw-wpd/textbase/Documents/kraus-wow-unpublished-30jan1994.pdf \"The Tantalizing WOW! Signal\"],  Copy of letter to Carl Sagan containing an unpublished paper describing the event.</ref>

== Signal measurement ==
[[File:Wow signal profile.svg|thumb|Plot of signal intensity versus time fitted with a [[Gaussian function]].]]
The string 6EQUJ5, commonly misinterpreted as a message encoded in the radio signal, represents in fact the signal's [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] variation over time, expressed in the particular measuring system adopted for the experiment. The signal itself appeared to be an unmodulated [[continuous wave]], although any [[modulation]] with a period of less than 10 seconds or longer than 72 seconds would not have been detectable.<ref name=\"Calib Wow\">{{cite web| last=Shuch| first=H. Paul |title=SETI Sensitivity: Calibrating on a Wow! Signal| url=http://www.setileague.org/articles/calibwow.htm |website=SETI League |accessdate=2016-06-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor-last1=Shuch |editor-first1=H. Paul |author-last1=Ehman |author-first1=Jerry R. |title=Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence: SETI Past, Present, and Future |date=2011 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=9783642131967 |page=59 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAk9bTm3Sj4C |language=en}}</ref>

=== Intensity ===
The signal intensity was measured as [[signal-to-noise ratio]], with the noise (or baseline) averaged over the previous few minutes. The signal was [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] for 10 seconds and then processed by the computer, which took 2 seconds. Therefore, every 12 seconds the result for each frequency channel was outputted on the printout as a single character, representing the 10-second average intensity, minus the baseline, expressed as a [[dimensionless]] multiple of the signal's [[standard deviation]].<ref name=\"code\">{{cite web | first = Jerry | last = Ehman | title = Explanation of the Code \"6EQUJ5\" On the Wow! Computer Printout | url = http://www.bigear.org/6equj5.htm | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>

In the chosen [[alphanumeric]] measuring system, a [[Space (punctuation)|space character]] denotes an intensity between 0 and 1, that is between baseline and one standard deviation above it. The numbers 1 to 9 denote the correspondingly numbered intensities (from 1 to 9); intensities of 10 and above are indicated by a letter: \"A\" corresponds to intensities between 10 and 11, \"B\" to 11 to 12, and so on. The Wow! signal's highest measured value was \"U\" (an intensity between 30 and 31), that is thirty standard deviations above background noise.<ref name=\"npr\" /><ref name=\"code\" />

=== Frequency ===
John Kraus, the director of the observatory, gave a value of {{val|1420.3556|ul=MHz}} in a 1994 summary written for [[Carl Sagan]].<ref name=Kraus/> But Ehman in 1998 gives a value of {{val|1420.4556|.005|u=MHz}}, with detailed explanation.<ref name=\"Big Ear 97\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bigear.org/wow20th.htm|first=Jerry R.|last=Ehman|title=The Big Ear Wow! Signal. What We Know and Don't Know About It After 20 Years|date=February 3, 1998|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref> This is ({{val|50|5|u=kHz}}) above the [[hydrogen line]] value (with no [[Redshift|red-]] or blue-shift) of {{val|1420.4056|u=MHz}}. If due to blue-shift, it would correspond to the source moving about {{cvt|10|km/s}} towards us.

[[File:Wow signal spectrogram.svg|thumb|A [[heat map]] of the computer printout, giving a [[spectrogram]] of the beam; the Wow! signal appears as a bright spot in the lower left.]]
An explanation of the difference between Ehman's value and Kraus's can be found in Ehman's paper. An [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]], which became the first [[local oscillator]], was ordered for the frequency of {{val|1450.4056|u=MHz}}. However, the university's purchasing department made a [[typographical error]] in the order and wrote {{val|1450.5056|u=MHz}} (i.e., {{val|0.1|u=MHz}} higher than desired). The software used in the experiment was then written to adjust for this error. When Ehman computed the frequency of the Wow! signal, he took this error into account.

=== Bandwidth ===
The Wow! signal was a [[narrowband]] emission: its [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] was less than {{val|10|u=kHz}}. The Big Ear telescope was equipped with a receiver capable of measuring fifty {{val|10|u=kHz}}-wide channels. The output from each channel was represented in the computer printout as a column of alphanumeric intensity values. The Wow! signal is essentially confined to one column.<ref name=\"Big Ear 97\"/>

=== Time variation ===
At the time of the observation, the Big Ear radio telescope was only adjustable for [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] (or height above the horizon), and relied instead on the [[rotation of the Earth]] to scan across the sky. Given the speed of Earth's rotation and the spatial width of the telescope's observation window, the Big Ear could observe any given point for just 72 seconds.<ref name=Skeptoid>{{Skeptoid|id=4342|number=342|title=Was the Wow! Signal Alien?|accessdate=2016-10-08}}</ref> A continuous extraterrestrial signal, therefore, would be expected to register for exactly 72 seconds, and the recorded intensity of such signal would display a gradual increase for the first 36 seconds—peaking at the center of the observation window—and then a gradual decrease as the telescope moved away from it. All these characteristics are present in the Wow! signal.<ref name=\"edn\">{{cite web | url=http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4394137/Big-Ear-receives--Wow--Signal--August-15--1977 | title=EDN Moments | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref><ref name=\"space_com\">{{cite news | url = http://www.bigear.org/shostak_wow_20021205.htm | first = Seth | last = Shostak | title = Interstellar Signal From the 70s Continues to Puzzle Researchers | publisher = Space.com | date = 2002-12-05 | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>

== Celestial location ==
[[File:Wow! signal source.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The two regions of space in the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] from where the Wow! signal may have originated. The ambiguity is due to how the experiment was designed. For clarity, the widths (right ascension) of the red bands have been exaggerated.]]
The precise location in the sky where the signal apparently originated is uncertain due to the design of the [[Big Ear]] telescope, which featured two [[feed horn]]s, each receiving a beam from slightly different directions, while following Earth's rotation. The Wow! signal was detected in one beam but not in the other, and the data was processed in such a way that it is impossible to determine which of the two horns received the signal.<ref name=\"feedhorns\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bigear.org/hshorns.htm | title=Big Ear's Twin Feed Horns | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref> There are, therefore, two possible [[right ascension]] (RA) values for the location of the signal (expressed below in terms of the two main [[Equatorial coordinate system|reference systems]]):<ref name=\"gray_2001\">{{cite journal | url = http://www.bigear.org/Gray-Marvel.pdf | first = Robert | last = Gray | first2 = Kevin | last2 = Marvel | title = A VLA Search for the Ohio State 'Wow' | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | issue=2 | volume = 546 | pages = 1171–77 | date = 2001 | doi = 10.1086/318272 | bibcode=2001ApJ...546.1171G}}</ref>

In contrast, the [[declination]] was unambiguously determined to be as follows:

The region of the sky in question lies northwest of the [[Messier 55|globular cluster M55]], in the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], roughly 2.5&nbsp;degrees south of the [[Magnitude (astronomy)|fifth-magnitude]] star group [[Chi Sagittarii]], and about 3.5&nbsp;degrees south of the plane of the [[ecliptic]]. The closest easily visible star is [[Tau Sagittarii]].<ref name=\"30thwow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bigear.org/Wow30th/wow30th.htm|last=Ehman|first=Jerry R.|title=The Big Ear Wow!

No nearby sun-like stars were within the antenna coordinates, although in any direction the antenna pattern would encompass about 6 distant stars.<ref name=\"Calib Wow\"/>

== Hypotheses on the signal's origin ==
A number of hypotheses have been advanced as to the source and nature of the Wow! signal. None of them have achieved widespread acceptance. [[Interstellar space|Interstellar]] [[Twinkling|scintillation]] of a weaker [[continuous signal]]—similar in effect to atmospheric twinkling—could be an explanation, but that would not exclude the possibility of the signal being artificial in origin. The significantly more sensitive [[Very Large Array]] did not detect the signal, and the [[probability]] that a signal below the detection threshold of the Very Large Array could be detected by the Big Ear due to interstellar scintillation is low.<ref name=\"discovery\" /> Other hypotheses include a rotating lighthouse-like source, a signal sweeping in frequency, or a one-time burst.<ref name=\"gray_2001\" />

Ehman has said: \"We should have seen it again when we looked for it 50 times. Something suggests it was an Earth-sourced signal that simply got reflected off a piece of [[space debris]].\"<ref name=\"cleveland_plain_dealer\">{{cite news | url = http://www.bigear.org/wow.htm | first = Barry | last = Kawa | newspaper = Cleveland Plain Dealer | date = 1994-09-18 | title = The Wow! signal | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref> He later recanted his skepticism somewhat, after further research showed an Earth-borne signal to be very unlikely, given the requirements of a space-borne reflector being bound to certain unrealistic requirements to sufficiently explain the signal.<ref name=\"Big Ear 97\"/> Also, it is problematic to propose that the 1420&nbsp;MHz signal originated from Earth since this is within a [[L band#Astronomy|protected spectrum]]: a bandwidth reserved for astronomical purposes in which terrestrial transmitters are forbidden to transmit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Significant Radio Astronomy Frequencies|url=http://www.setileague.org/articles/protectd.htm|website=SETI League|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref><ref name=\"CRAF\">{{cite book|url=http://www.astrosmo.unam.mx/~luisfr/CRAFHandbook3.pdf |title=Committee on Radio Astronomy Frequencies Handbook for Radio Astronomy |publisher=European Science Foundation |edition=3rd |date=2005 |page=101}}</ref> In a 1997 paper, Ehman resists \"drawing vast conclusions from half-vast data\"—acknowledging the possibility that the source may have been military or otherwise a product of Earth-bound humans.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Frank|first1=Adam|title=Talking To Aliens From Outer Space|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2012/07/10/156540615/talking-to-aliens-from-outer-space|accessdate=2016-07-02|work=NPR|date=July 10, 2012}}</ref>

[[Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence|METI]] president [[Douglas Vakoch]] told ''[[Die Welt]]'' that any putative SETI signal detections must be replicated for confirmation, and the lack of such replication for the Wow! signal means it has little credibility.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/article1439767/Welche-Sprache-sprechen-Ausserirdische.html|title=Welche Sprache sprechen Außerirdische?|last=Marsiske|first=Hans-Arthur|date=2007-09-12|website=Die Welt|access-date=}}</ref>

In a 2012 podcast, [[Skeptical movement|scientific skeptic]] author [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]] concluded that a radio transmission from deep space in the direction of Sagittarius, as opposed to a near-Earth origin, remains the best technical explanation for the emission, although there is no evidence to conclude that an alien intelligence was the source.<ref name=Skeptoid/>

In 2017, Antonio Paris, a teacher from Florida, proposed that the hydrogen cloud surrounding two [[comet]]s, [[266P/Christensen]] and [[335P/Gibbs]], now known to have been in the same region of the sky, could have been the source of the Wow! signal.<ref name=\"Paris-1\">{{cite journal|last1=Paris|first1=Antonio|title=Hydrogen Clouds from Comets 266/P Christensen and P/2008 Y2 (Gibbs) are Candidates for the Source of the 1977 \"WOW\" Signal|journal=Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences|date=1 January 2016|url=http://planetary-science.org/hydrogen-clouds-from-comets-266p-christensen-and-p2008-y2-gibbs-are-candidates-for-the-source-of-the-1977-wow-signal/|accessdate=13 June 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615182709/http://planetary-science.org/hydrogen-clouds-from-comets-266p-christensen-and-p2008-y2-gibbs-are-candidates-for-the-source-of-the-1977-wow-signal/|archivedate=15 June 2017|bibcode=2017arXiv170604642P|arxiv=1706.04642}}</ref><ref name=\"Paris-2\">{{cite journal|last1=Paris|first1=Antonio|title=Hydrogen Line Observations of Cometary Spectra at 1420 MHZ|journal=Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences|date=1 April 2017|volume=103|issue=2|url=http://planetary-science.org/research/the-wow-signal/|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite arXiv |eprint = 1706.04642|last1 = Paris|first1 = Antonio|title = Hydrogen Clouds from Comets 266P Christensen and P2008 Y2 (Gibbs) are Candidates for the Source of the 1977 WOW!Signal|last2 = Davies|first2 = Evan|class = astro-ph.EP|year = 2017}}</ref> This hypothesis was dismissed by astronomers, including members of the original Big Ear research team, as the cited comets were not in the beam at the correct time.

== Searches for recurrence of the signal ==
Several attempts were made by Ehman and other astronomers to recover and identify the signal. The signal was expected to occur three minutes apart in each of the telescope's feed horns, but that did not happen.<ref name=\"space_com\" /> Ehman unsuccessfully searched for recurrences using Big Ear in the months after the detection.<ref name=\"discovery\">{{cite news | url=http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/the-wow-signal-130524.htm | title=The 'Wow!' Signal| publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>

In 1987 and 1989, [[Robert H. Gray]] searched for the event using the META array at [[Oak Ridge Observatory]], but did not detect it.<ref name=\"discovery\" /><ref name=\"gray_2012\">{{cite book|title=The Elusive WOW: Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence|last=Gray|first=Robert H|date=2012|publisher=Palmer Square Press|location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-9839584-4-4}}</ref> In a July 1995 test of signal detection software to be used in its upcoming [[Project Argus (SETI)|Project Argus]], SETI League executive director [[H. Paul Shuch]] made several drift-scan observations of the Wow! signal's coordinates with a 12-meter radio telescope at the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] in [[Green Bank, West Virginia]], also achieving a [[null result]].

In 1995 and 1996, Gray again searched for the signal using the [[Very Large Array]], which is significantly more sensitive than Big Ear.<ref name=\"discovery\" /><ref name=\"gray_2012\" /> Gray and Simon Ellingsen later searched for recurrences of the event in 1999 using the 26-meter radio telescope at the [[University of Tasmania]]'s [[Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory]].<ref name=\"gray_2002\">{{cite journal | first = Robert | last = Gray | first2 = S. | last2 = Ellingsen | title = A Search for Periodic Emissions at the Wow Locale | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 578 | issue=2 | pages = 967–71 | date = 2002 | doi = 10.1086/342646 | bibcode=2002ApJ...578..967G}}</ref> Six 14-hour observations were made at positions in the vicinity, but nothing like the Wow! signal was detected.<ref name=\"space_com\" /><ref name=\"gray_2012\" />

== Response ==
In 2012, on the 35th anniversary of the Wow! signal, [[Arecibo Observatory]] beamed a digital stream toward the area of the signal's origin. The transmission consisted of approximately 10,000 [[Twitter]] messages solicited for the purpose by the [[National Geographic Channel]], bearing the [[hashtag]] \"#ChasingUFOs\" (a promotion for one of the channel's TV series).<ref name=\"wolchover\"/> The sponsor also included a series of video vignettes featuring verbal messages from various celebrities.<ref name=\"spacedotcom\">{{cite news | url = http://www.space.com/17151-alien-wow-signal-response.html | title = Humanity Responds to 'Alien' Wow Signal, 35 Years Later | publisher = Space.com | date = 2012-08-12}}</ref>

To increase the probability that any extraterrestrial recipients would recognize the signal as an intentional communication from another intelligent life form, Arecibo scientists attached a repeating-sequence [[Header (computing)|header]] to each individual message, and beamed the transmission at roughly 20 times the wattage of the most powerful commercial radio transmitter.<ref name=\"wolchover\">{{cite news | url = https://www.livescience.com/21171-wow-signal-alien-message-reply.html | title = Possible Alien Message to Get Reply from Humanity | first = Natalie | last = Wolchover | publisher = Discovery News | date = 2012-06-27}}</ref>

The '''Wow! signal''' was a strong [[narrowband]] [[radio signal]] received on August 15, 1977 by [[Ohio State University]]'s [[Big Ear]] radio telescope in the United States, then used to support the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]]. The signal appeared to come from the direction of the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] and bore the expected hallmarks of [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|extraterrestrial]] origin.

Astronomer Jerry R. Ehman discovered the anomaly a few days later while reviewing the recorded data. He was so impressed by the result that he circled the reading on the computer printout, \"6EQUJ5\", and wrote the comment ''\"Wow!\"'' on its side, leading to the event's widely used name.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126510251|title=Aliens Found In Ohio? The 'Wow!' Signal|last=Krulwich|first=Robert|publisher=[[NPR|National Public Radio]]|date=May 29, 2010|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>

The entire signal sequence lasted for the full 72-second window during which Big Ear was able to observe it, but has not been detected since, despite several subsequent attempts by Ehman and others. Many hypotheses have been advanced on the origin of the emission, including natural and human-made sources, but none of them adequately explain the signal.<ref name=Skeptoid/>

Although the Wow! signal had no detectable [[modulation]]—a technique used to transmit information over radio waves—it remains the strongest candidate for an alien radio transmission ever detected.<ref name=Skeptoid/>

== Background ==
In a 1959 paper, [[Cornell University]] physicists [[Philip Morrison]] and [[Giuseppe Cocconi]] had speculated that any [[extraterrestrial civilization]] attempting to communicate via radio signals might do so using a frequency of {{val|1420}} [[megahertz]] ({{val|21}} [[centimeters]]), which is [[Hydrogen line|naturally emitted by hydrogen]], the most common element in the universe and therefore likely familiar to all technologically advanced civilizations.<ref name=\"Nat Geo\">{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/chasing-ufos/articles/what-is-the-wow-signal/|title=What is the Wow! signal?|last=Kiger|first=Patrick J.|date=2012-06-21|website=National Geographic Channel|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>

In 1973, after completing an extensive [[Ohio Sky Survey|survey of extragalactic radio sources]], Ohio State University assigned the now-defunct [[Ohio State University Radio Observatory]] (nicknamed \"Big Ear\") to the scientific [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI), in the longest-running program of its kind in history. The radio telescope was located near the [[Perkins Observatory]] on the campus of [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in [[Delaware, Ohio]].

By 1977, Ehman was working at the SETI project as a volunteer; his job involved analyzing by hand large amounts of data processed by an [[IBM 1130]] computer and recorded on [[line printer]] paper. While perusing data collected on August 15 at 22:16&nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (02:16&nbsp;[[UTC]]), he spotted a series of values of signal intensity and frequency that left him and his colleagues astonished.<ref name=\"Nat Geo\" />
The event was later documented in technical detail by the observatory's director.<ref name=Kraus>John Kraus, Director, Ohio State Radio Observatory 31, January 1994, [http://jump2.nrao.edu/dbtw-wpd/textbase/Documents/kraus-wow-unpublished-30jan1994.pdf \"The Tantalizing WOW! Signal\"],  Copy of letter to Carl Sagan containing an unpublished paper describing the event.</ref>

== Signal measurement ==
[[File:Wow signal profile.svg|thumb|Plot of signal intensity versus time fitted with a [[Gaussian function]].]]
The string 6EQUJ5, commonly misinterpreted as a message encoded in the radio signal, represents in fact the signal's [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] variation over time, expressed in the particular measuring system adopted for the experiment. The signal itself appeared to be an unmodulated [[continuous wave]], although any [[modulation]] with a period of less than 10 seconds or longer than 72 seconds would not have been detectable.<ref name=\"Calib Wow\">{{cite web| last=Shuch| first=H. Paul |title=SETI Sensitivity: Calibrating on a Wow! Signal| url=http://www.setileague.org/articles/calibwow.htm |website=SETI League |accessdate=2016-06-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor-last1=Shuch |editor-first1=H. Paul |author-last1=Ehman |author-first1=Jerry R. |title=Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence: SETI Past, Present, and Future |date=2011 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=9783642131967 |page=59 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAk9bTm3Sj4C |language=en}}</ref>

=== Intensity ===
The signal intensity was measured as [[signal-to-noise ratio]], with the noise (or baseline) averaged over the previous few minutes. The signal was [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] for 10 seconds and then processed by the computer, which took 2 seconds. Therefore, every 12 seconds the result for each frequency channel was outputted on the printout as a single character, representing the 10-second average intensity, minus the baseline, expressed as a [[dimensionless]] multiple of the signal's [[standard deviation]].<ref name=\"code\">{{cite web | first = Jerry | last = Ehman | title = Explanation of the Code \"6EQUJ5\" On the Wow! Computer Printout | url = http://www.bigear.org/6equj5.htm | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>

In the chosen [[alphanumeric]] measuring system, a [[Space (punctuation)|space character]] denotes an intensity between 0 and 1, that is between baseline and one standard deviation above it. The numbers 1 to 9 denote the correspondingly numbered intensities (from 1 to 9); intensities of 10 and above are indicated by a letter: \"A\" corresponds to intensities between 10 and 11, \"B\" to 11 to 12, and so on. The Wow! signal's highest measured value was \"U\" (an intensity between 30 and 31), that is thirty standard deviations above background noise.<ref name=\"npr\" /><ref name=\"code\" />

=== Frequency ===
John Kraus, the director of the observatory, gave a value of {{val|1420.3556|ul=MHz}} in a 1994 summary written for [[Carl Sagan]].<ref name=Kraus/> But Ehman in 1998 gives a value of {{val|1420.4556|.005|u=MHz}}, with detailed explanation.<ref name=\"Big Ear 97\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bigear.org/wow20th.htm|first=Jerry R.|last=Ehman|title=The Big Ear Wow! Signal. What We Know and Don't Know About It After 20 Years|date=February 3, 1998|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref> This is ({{val|50|5|u=kHz}}) above the [[hydrogen line]] value (with no [[Redshift|red-]] or blue-shift) of {{val|1420.4056|u=MHz}}. If due to blue-shift, it would correspond to the source moving about {{cvt|10|km/s}} towards us.

[[File:Wow signal spectrogram.svg|thumb|A [[heat map]] of the computer printout, giving a [[spectrogram]] of the beam; the Wow! signal appears as a bright spot in the lower left.]]
An explanation of the difference between Ehman's value and Kraus's can be found in Ehman's paper. An [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]], which became the first [[local oscillator]], was ordered for the frequency of {{val|1450.4056|u=MHz}}. However, the university's purchasing department made a [[typographical error]] in the order and wrote {{val|1450.5056|u=MHz}} (i.e., {{val|0.1|u=MHz}} higher than desired). The software used in the experiment was then written to adjust for this error. When Ehman computed the frequency of the Wow! signal, he took this error into account.

=== Bandwidth ===
The Wow! signal was a [[narrowband]] emission: its [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] was less than {{val|10|u=kHz}}. The Big Ear telescope was equipped with a receiver capable of measuring fifty {{val|10|u=kHz}}-wide channels. The output from each channel was represented in the computer printout as a column of alphanumeric intensity values. The Wow! signal is essentially confined to one column.<ref name=\"Big Ear 97\"/>

=== Time variation ===
At the time of the observation, the Big Ear radio telescope was only adjustable for [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] (or height above the horizon), and relied instead on the [[rotation of the Earth]] to scan across the sky. Given the speed of Earth's rotation and the spatial width of the telescope's observation window, the Big Ear could observe any given point for just 72 seconds.<ref name=Skeptoid>{{Skeptoid|id=4342|number=342|title=Was the Wow! Signal Alien?|accessdate=2016-10-08}}</ref> A continuous extraterrestrial signal, therefore, would be expected to register for exactly 72 seconds, and the recorded intensity of such signal would display a gradual increase for the first 36 seconds—peaking at the center of the observation window—and then a gradual decrease as the telescope moved away from it. All these characteristics are present in the Wow! signal.<ref name=\"edn\">{{cite web | url=http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4394137/Big-Ear-receives--Wow--Signal--August-15--1977 | title=EDN Moments | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref><ref name=\"space_com\">{{cite news | url = http://www.bigear.org/shostak_wow_20021205.htm | first = Seth | last = Shostak | title = Interstellar Signal From the 70s Continues to Puzzle Researchers | publisher = Space.com | date = 2002-12-05 | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>

== Celestial location ==
[[File:Wow! signal source.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The two regions of space in the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] from where the Wow! signal may have originated. The ambiguity is due to how the experiment was designed. For clarity, the widths (right ascension) of the red bands have been exaggerated.]]
The precise location in the sky where the signal apparently originated is uncertain due to the design of the [[Big Ear]] telescope, which featured two [[feed horn]]s, each receiving a beam from slightly different directions, while following Earth's rotation. The Wow! signal was detected in one beam but not in the other, and the data was processed in such a way that it is impossible to determine which of the two horns received the signal.<ref name=\"feedhorns\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bigear.org/hshorns.htm | title=Big Ear's Twin Feed Horns | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref> There are, therefore, two possible [[right ascension]] (RA) values for the location of the signal (expressed below in terms of the two main [[Equatorial coordinate system|reference systems]]):<ref name=\"gray_2001\">{{cite journal | url = http://www.bigear.org/Gray-Marvel.pdf | first = Robert | last = Gray | first2 = Kevin | last2 = Marvel | title = A VLA Search for the Ohio State 'Wow' | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | issue=2 | volume = 546 | pages = 1171–77 | date = 2001 | doi = 10.1086/318272 | bibcode=2001ApJ...546.1171G}}</ref>

In contrast, the [[declination]] was unambiguously determined to be as follows:

The [[galactic coordinates]] for the positive horn are {{math|''l''}}=11.7°, {{math|''b''}}=−18.9°, and for the negative horn {{math|''l''}}=11.9°, {{math|''b''}}=−19.5°, both being therefore about 19° toward the southeast of the galactic plane, and about 24° or 25° east of the [[galactic centre]]. The region of the sky in question lies northwest of the [[Messier 55|globular cluster M55]], in the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], roughly 2.5&nbsp;degrees south of the [[Magnitude (astronomy)|fifth-magnitude]] star group [[Chi Sagittarii]], and about 3.5&nbsp;degrees south of the plane of the [[ecliptic]]. The closest easily visible star is [[Tau Sagittarii]].<ref name=\"30thwow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bigear.org/Wow30th/wow30th.htm|last=Ehman|first=Jerry R.|title=The Big Ear Wow!

No nearby sun-like stars were within the antenna coordinates, although in any direction the antenna pattern would encompass about 6 distant stars.<ref name=\"Calib Wow\"/>

== Hypotheses on the signal's origin ==
A number of hypotheses have been advanced as to the source and nature of the Wow! signal. None of them have achieved widespread acceptance. [[Interstellar space|Interstellar]] [[Twinkling|scintillation]] of a weaker [[continuous signal]]—similar in effect to atmospheric twinkling—could be an explanation, but that would not exclude the possibility of the signal being artificial in origin. The significantly more sensitive [[Very Large Array]] did not detect the signal, and the [[probability]] that a signal below the detection threshold of the Very Large Array could be detected by the Big Ear due to interstellar scintillation is low.<ref name=\"discovery\" /> Other hypotheses include a rotating lighthouse-like source, a signal sweeping in frequency, or a one-time burst.<ref name=\"gray_2001\" />

Ehman has said: \"We should have seen it again when we looked for it 50 times. Something suggests it was an Earth-sourced signal that simply got reflected off a piece of [[space debris]].\"<ref name=\"cleveland_plain_dealer\">{{cite news | url = http://www.bigear.org/wow.htm | first = Barry | last = Kawa | newspaper = Cleveland Plain Dealer | date = 1994-09-18 | title = The Wow! signal | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref> He later recanted his skepticism somewhat, after further research showed an Earth-borne signal to be very unlikely, given the requirements of a space-borne reflector being bound to certain unrealistic requirements to sufficiently explain the signal.<ref name=\"Big Ear 97\"/> Also, it is problematic to propose that the 1420&nbsp;MHz signal originated from Earth since this is within a [[L band#Astronomy|protected spectrum]]: a bandwidth reserved for astronomical purposes in which terrestrial transmitters are forbidden to transmit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Significant Radio Astronomy Frequencies|url=http://www.setileague.org/articles/protectd.htm|website=SETI League|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref><ref name=\"CRAF\">{{cite book|url=http://www.astrosmo.unam.mx/~luisfr/CRAFHandbook3.pdf |title=Committee on Radio Astronomy Frequencies Handbook for Radio Astronomy |publisher=European Science Foundation |edition=3rd |date=2005 |page=101}}</ref> In a 1997 paper, Ehman resists \"drawing vast conclusions from half-vast data\"—acknowledging the possibility that the source may have been military or otherwise a product of Earth-bound humans.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Frank|first1=Adam|title=Talking To Aliens From Outer Space|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2012/07/10/156540615/talking-to-aliens-from-outer-space|accessdate=2016-07-02|work=NPR|date=July 10, 2012}}</ref>

[[Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence|METI]] president [[Douglas Vakoch]] told ''[[Die Welt]]'' that any putative SETI signal detections must be replicated for confirmation, and the lack of such replication for the Wow! signal means it has little credibility.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/article1439767/Welche-Sprache-sprechen-Ausserirdische.html|title=Welche Sprache sprechen Außerirdische?|last=Marsiske|first=Hans-Arthur|date=2007-09-12|website=Die Welt|access-date=}}</ref>

In a 2012 podcast, [[Skeptical movement|scientific skeptic]] author [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]] concluded that a radio transmission from deep space in the direction of Sagittarius, as opposed to a near-Earth origin, remains the best technical explanation for the emission, although there is no evidence to conclude that an alien intelligence was the source.<ref name=Skeptoid/>

In 2017, Antonio Paris, a teacher from Florida, proposed that the hydrogen cloud surrounding two [[comet]]s, [[266P/Christensen]] and [[335P/Gibbs]], now known to have been in the same region of the sky, could have been the source of the Wow! signal.<ref name=\"Paris-1\">{{cite journal|last1=Paris|first1=Antonio|title=Hydrogen Clouds from Comets 266/P Christensen and P/2008 Y2 (Gibbs) are Candidates for the Source of the 1977 \"WOW\" Signal|journal=Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences|date=1 January 2016|url=http://planetary-science.org/hydrogen-clouds-from-comets-266p-christensen-and-p2008-y2-gibbs-are-candidates-for-the-source-of-the-1977-wow-signal/|accessdate=13 June 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615182709/http://planetary-science.org/hydrogen-clouds-from-comets-266p-christensen-and-p2008-y2-gibbs-are-candidates-for-the-source-of-the-1977-wow-signal/|archivedate=15 June 2017|bibcode=2017arXiv170604642P|arxiv=1706.04642}}</ref><ref name=\"Paris-2\">{{cite journal|last1=Paris|first1=Antonio|title=Hydrogen Line Observations of Cometary Spectra at 1420 MHZ|journal=Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences|date=1 April 2017|volume=103|issue=2|url=http://planetary-science.org/research/the-wow-signal/|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite arXiv |eprint = 1706.04642|last1 = Paris|first1 = Antonio|title = Hydrogen Clouds from Comets 266P Christensen and P2008 Y2 (Gibbs) are Candidates for the Source of the 1977 WOW!Signal|last2 = Davies|first2 = Evan|class = astro-ph.EP|year = 2017}}</ref> This hypothesis was dismissed by astronomers, including members of the original Big Ear research team, as the cited comets were not in the beam at the correct time.

== Searches for recurrence of the signal ==
Several attempts were made by Ehman and other astronomers to recover and identify the signal. The signal was expected to occur three minutes apart in each of the telescope's feed horns, but that did not happen.<ref name=\"space_com\" /> Ehman unsuccessfully searched for recurrences using Big Ear in the months after the detection.<ref name=\"discovery\">{{cite news | url=http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/the-wow-signal-130524.htm | title=The 'Wow!' Signal| publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>

In 1987 and 1989, [[Robert H. Gray]] searched for the event using the META array at [[Oak Ridge Observatory]], but did not detect it.<ref name=\"discovery\" /><ref name=\"gray_2012\">{{cite book|title=The Elusive WOW: Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence|last=Gray|first=Robert H|date=2012|publisher=Palmer Square Press|location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-9839584-4-4}}</ref> In a July 1995 test of signal detection software to be used in its upcoming [[Project Argus (SETI)|Project Argus]], SETI League executive director [[H. Paul Shuch]] made several drift-scan observations of the Wow! signal's coordinates with a 12-meter radio telescope at the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] in [[Green Bank, West Virginia]], also achieving a [[null result]].

In 1995 and 1996, Gray again searched for the signal using the [[Very Large Array]], which is significantly more sensitive than Big Ear.<ref name=\"discovery\" /><ref name=\"gray_2012\" /> Gray and Simon Ellingsen later searched for recurrences of the event in 1999 using the 26-meter radio telescope at the [[University of Tasmania]]'s [[Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory]].<ref name=\"gray_2002\">{{cite journal | first = Robert | last = Gray | first2 = S. | last2 = Ellingsen | title = A Search for Periodic Emissions at the Wow Locale | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 578 | issue=2 | pages = 967–71 | date = 2002 | doi = 10.1086/342646 | bibcode=2002ApJ...578..967G}}</ref> Six 14-hour observations were made at positions in the vicinity, but nothing like the Wow! signal was detected.<ref name=\"space_com\" /><ref name=\"gray_2012\" />

== Response ==
In 2012, on the 35th anniversary of the Wow! signal, [[Arecibo Observatory]] beamed a digital stream toward the area of the signal's origin. The transmission consisted of approximately 10,000 [[Twitter]] messages solicited for the purpose by the [[National Geographic Channel]], bearing the [[hashtag]] \"#ChasingUFOs\" (a promotion for one of the channel's TV series).<ref name=\"wolchover\"/> The sponsor also included a series of video vignettes featuring verbal messages from various celebrities.<ref name=\"spacedotcom\">{{cite news | url = http://www.space.com/17151-alien-wow-signal-response.html | title = Humanity Responds to 'Alien' Wow Signal, 35 Years Later | publisher = Space.com | date = 2012-08-12}}</ref>

To increase the probability that any extraterrestrial recipients would recognize the signal as an intentional communication from another intelligent life form, Arecibo scientists attached a repeating-sequence [[Header (computing)|header]] to each individual message, and beamed the transmission at roughly 20 times the wattage of the most powerful commercial radio transmitter.<ref name=\"wolchover\">{{cite news | url = https://www.livescience.com/21171-wow-signal-alien-message-reply.html | title = Possible Alien Message to Get Reply from Humanity | first = Natalie | last = Wolchover | publisher = Discovery News | date = 2012-06-27}}</ref>

'''Michael Norman Manley''' [[Order of the Nation|ON]] [[Order of the Caribbean Community|OCC]] (10 December 1924 – 6 March 1997) was a [[Jamaica]]n politician who served as the fourth [[Prime Minister of Jamaica]] from 1972 to 1980 and from 1989 to 1992. Manley championed a [[democratic socialist]] program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20090308/focus/focus4.html |title=Michael Manley: nation-builder |author=Robert Buddan |publisher=[[Jamaica Gleaner]] |date=8 March 2009 |access-date=11 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061311/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20090308/focus/focus4.html |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> According to opinion polls, he remains one of Jamaica's most popular prime ministers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120812/focus/focus6.html |title=Where Would Jamaica Be Without Michael Manley? |work=Jamaica Gleaner|date=12 August 2012| access-date=11 March 2013}}</ref>

==Pre-political career==
Manley, who is the second son of  politician [[Norman Washington Manley]] and  [[Edna Manley]], attended [[Jamaica College]] and then served in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] during [[World War II]]. In 1945, he enrolled at the [[London School of Economics]]. He graduated in 1949, and returned to Jamaica to serve as an editor and columnist for the newspaper ''Public Opinion''. At about the same time, he became involved in the [[trade union]] movement, becoming a [[negotiation|negotiator]] for the [[National Workers Union (Jamaica)|National Workers Union]]. In August 1953, he became a full-time official of that union.<ref name=\"Lentz\">{{cite book|last=Lentz|first=Harris M., III|title=''Heads of States and Governments''|year=1994|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|location=[[Jefferson, NC]]|isbn=0-89950-926-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/headsofstatesgov00lent/page/451 451]–452|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/headsofstatesgov00lent}}</ref>

==Entry into politics==
When his father was elected premier of Jamaica in 1955, Manley resisted entering politics, not wanting to be seen as capitalizing on his family name. However, in 1962, he accepted an appointment to the Senate of the [[Parliament of Jamaica]]. He won election to the Jamaican House of Representatives for the Central Kingston constituency in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Manley|title=Michael Manley - prime minister of Jamaica|author=|date=|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/political-career/|title=Political Leader|first=Peter Scott Chrysalis|last=Communications|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>

After his father's retirement in 1969, Manley was elected leader of the [[People's National Party]], defeating [[Vivian Blake (politician)|Vivian Blake]].<ref name=\"Waters\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3tmxS6La_EC&pg=PA98|first=Anita M.|last=Waters|title=Race, Class, and Political Symbols: Rastafari and Reggae in Jamaican Politics|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1985|page=98|access-date=8 July 2012}}</ref> He then served as [[Leader of the Opposition (Jamaica)|leader of the Opposition]], until his party won in the general elections of 1972.<ref name=\"Lentz\"/>

==Domestic reforms==
In the election of 1972, Manley defeated the unpopular incumbent Prime Minister, [[Hugh Shearer]], as his People's National Party swept to a landslide victory with 37 of 53 seats.<ref name=\"auto\"/>

He instituted a series of socio-economic reforms that produced mixed results. Although he was a Jamaican from an elite family, Manley's successful [[trade union]] background helped him to maintain a close relationship with the country's poor majority, and he was a dynamic, popular leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/trade-unionist/|title=Trade Unionist|first=Peter Scott Chrysalis|last=Communications|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> Unlike his father, who had a reputation for being formal and businesslike, the younger Manley moved easily among people of all strata and made Parliament accessible to the people by abolishing the requirement for men to wear [[jacket]]s and [[Necktie|ties]] to its sittings. In this regard he started a fashion revolution, often preferring the [[Kariba suit]], a type of formal bush jacket suit with trousers and worn without a shirt and tie.<ref name=\"auto\"/>

Under Manley, Jamaica established a minimum wage for all workers, including domestic workers.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Michael-Manley---the-visionary-who-will-never-be|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|author=|date=|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> In 1974, Manley proposed free education from primary school to university. The introduction of universally free secondary education was a major step in removing the institutional barriers to private sector and preferred government jobs that required secondary diplomas.<ref>Ewart Walters, ''We Come From Jamaica''  (Ottawa: Boyd McRubie, 2014), p. 198</ref> The PNP government in 1974 also formed the Jamaica Movement for the Advancement of Literacy (JAMAL), which administered adult education programs with the goal of involving 100,000 adults a year.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/>

Land reform expanded under his administration. Historically, land tenure in Jamaica has been rather inequitable. Project Land Lease (introduced in 1973), attempted an integrated rural development approach, providing tens of thousands of small farmers with land, technical advice, inputs such as fertilizers, and access to credit.<ref>Walters, p. 198</ref> An estimated 14 percent of idle land was redistributed through this program, much of which had been abandoned during the post-war urban migration or purchased by large [[bauxite]] companies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The minimum voting age was lowered to 18 years, while equal pay for women was introduced.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Insight Guide: Jamaica'', Insight Guides, APA Publications, 2009.</ref> Maternity leave was also introduced, while the government outlawed the stigma of illegitimacy. The [[Masters and Servants Act]] was abolished, and a Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Act provided workers and their trade unions with enhanced rights. The National Housing Trust was established, providing \"the means for most employed people to own their own homes,\" and greatly stimulated housing construction, with more than 40,000 houses built between 1974 and 1980.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>

Subsidised meals, transportation and uniforms for schoolchildren from disadvantaged backgrounds were introduced,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> together with free education at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Chuck Stewart, ''The Greenwood Encyclopaedia of LGBT Issues Worldwide'', Volume 1.</ref> Special employment programmes were also launched,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Kari Levitt, ''Reclaiming Development: independent thought and Caribbean community''.</ref> together with programmes designed to combat illiteracy.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Increases in pensions and poor relief were carried out,<ref name=Kaufman>Michael Kaufman, ''Jamaica under Manley: dilemmas of socialism and democracy''.</ref> along with a reform of local government taxation, an increase in youth training,<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> an expansion of day care centres.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> and an upgrading of hospitals.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\">Euclid A. Rose, ''Dependency and Socialism in the Modern Caribbean: Superpower Intervention in Guyana, Jamaica and Grenada, 1970-1985''.</ref>

A worker's participation programme was introduced,<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">David Panton, ''Jamaica’s Michael Manley: The Great Transformation (1972-92)''.</ref> together with a new mental health law<ref name=\"ReferenceE\">Darrell E. Levi, ''Michael Manley: the making of a leader''.</ref> and the family court.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> Free health care for all Jamaicans was introduced, while health clinics and a paramedical system in rural areas were established. Various clinics were also set up to facilitate access to medical drugs. Spending on education was significantly increased, while the number of doctors and dentists in the country rose.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> Project Lend Lease, an agricultural programme designed to provide rural labourers and smallholders with more land through tenancy, was introduced, together with a National Youth Service Programme for high school graduates to teach in schools, vocational training, and the literacy programme, comprehensive rent and price controls, protection for workers against unfair dismissal, subsidies (in 1973) on basic food items,<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> and the automatic recognition of unions in the workplace.<ref name=Kaufman />

Manley was the first Jamaican prime minister to support [[Jamaican republicanism]] (the replacement of the [[Monarchy of Jamaica|constitutional monarchy]] with a republic). In 1975, his government established a commission into constitutional reform, which recommended that Jamaica become a republic. In July 1977, after a march to commemorate the [[Morant Bay Rebellion]], Manley announced that Jamaica would become a republic by 1981. This did not occur, however.<ref name=\"burke\">Michael Burke, [http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Queen--emperor-and-republican-status_58297 \"Queen, emperor and republican status\"], ''[[The Jamaica Observer]]'', 21 April 2016.

==Diplomacy==
[[File:Mrs. Michael Manley, Prime Minister Michael Manley and Jimmy Carter during an Oval Office meeting 1977.png|thumb|Manley (age 52) and his fourth wife Beverly with US president [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1977]]

Manley developed close friendships with several foreign leaders, foremost of whom were [[Julius Nyerere]] of Tanzania, [[Olof Palme]] of Sweden, [[Pierre Trudeau]] of Canada and [[Fidel Castro]] of Cuba.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/world-statesman/|title=World Statesman|first=Peter Scott Chrysalis|last=Communications|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> With Cuba just {{convert|145|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Jamaica, he strengthened diplomatic relations between the two [[island]] nations, much to the dismay of [[United States]] policymakers.

In a speech given at the 1979 meeting of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], Manley strongly pressed for the development of what was called a natural alliance between the Non-Aligned movement and the Soviet Union to battle imperialism: <blockquote>\"All anti-imperialists know that the balance of forces in the world shifted irrevocably in 1917 when there was a movement and a man in the October Revolution, and Lenin was the man.\"<ref>Anthony Livingston Hall, ''The Ipinions Journals, Commentaries on Current Events,'' Vol. II (Lincoln, 2007), p. 240</ref></blockquote> Despite some international opposition, Manley deepened and strengthened Jamaica's ties with Cuba.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/>

In diplomatic affairs, Manley believed in respecting the different systems of government of other countries and not interfering in their internal affairs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Violence==
Manley was Prime Minister when Jamaica experienced a significant escalation of its political culture of violence. Supporters of his opponent [[Edward Seaga]] and the [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP) and Manley's [[People's National Party]] (PNP) engaged in a bloody struggle which began before the 1976 election and ended when Seaga was installed as Prime Minister in 1980. While the violent political culture was not invented by Seaga or Manley, and had its roots in conflicts between the parties from as early as the beginning of the [[two-party system]] in the 1940s, political violence reached unprecedented levels in the 1970s. Indeed, the two elections accompanied by the greatest violence were those (1976 and 1980) in which Seaga was trying to unseat Manley.<ref>Walters, pp. 200-5.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10173302|title=Jamaica violence 'linked to US drug market'|first=Jon|last=Silverman|date=27 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

In response to a wave of killings in 1974, Manley oversaw the passage of the [[Gun Court]] Act and the Suppression of Crime Act, giving the police and the army new powers to seal off and disarm high-violence neighborhoods. The Gun Court imposed a mandatory sentence of indefinite imprisonment with hard labour for all firearms offences, and ordinarily tried cases ''[[in camera]]'', without a jury.  Manley declared that \"There is no place in this society for the gun, now or ever.\"<ref name=\"time\">{{cite news|title=Stalag in Kingston|work=[[Time Magazine]]|date=23 September 1974|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908746,00.html|access-date=14 January 2009}}</ref>

Violence flared in January 1976 in anticipation of elections. A [[state of emergency]] was declared by Manley's party the PNP in June and 500 people, including some prominent members of the JLP, were accused of trying to overthrow the government and were detained, without charges, in the [[South Camp Adult Correctional Centre|South Camp Prison]] at the [[Up-Park Camp]] military headquarters.<ref name=\"jg\">''The Daily Gleaner'', Monday, 6 July 1986, p. 14.</ref> Elections were held on 15 December that year, while the state of emergency was still in effect. The PNP was returned to office. The state of emergency continued into the next year. Extraordinary powers granted the police by the Suppression of Crime Act of 1974 continued to the end of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Can-we-really-entrust-the-JCF-with-the-anti-gang-legislation-_16149216|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|author=|date=|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>

Violence continued to blight political life in the 1970s. Gangs armed by both parties fought for control of urban constituencies. In the election year of 1980 over 800 Jamaicans were killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/The-bloody-general-election-that-changed-Jamaica|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|author=|date=|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> Jamaicans were particularly shocked by the violence at that time.

In the 1980 elections, Seaga's JLP won and he became Prime Minister.

==Opposition==
As [[Official opposition|Leader of the Opposition]] Manley became an outspoken critic of the new conservative administration. He strongly opposed intervention in Grenada after Prime Minister [[Maurice Bishop]] was overthrown and executed. Immediately after committing Jamaican troops to [[Invasion of Grenada|Grenada]] in 1983, Seaga called a snap election – two years early – on the pretext that Dr Paul Robertson, General Secretary of the PNP, had called for his resignation. Manley, who may have been taken by surprise by the maneuver, led his party in a boycott of the elections, and so the Jamaica Labour Party won all seats in parliament against only marginal opposition in six of the sixty electoral constituencies.<ref name=\"auto\"/>

Manley was largely opposed by the United States government for conducting close relations with Fidel Castro and Cuba during the Cold War. Manley allowed Cuban technicians to work on Jamaican soil for projects. In 1977, Manley visited President Jimmy Carter at the White House to remedy the situation. Details of the meeting, however, were never disclosed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

During his period of opposition in the 1980s, Manley, a compelling speaker,{{Opinion|date=February 2019}} travelled extensively, speaking to audiences around the world. He taught a graduate seminar and gave a series of public lectures at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 1986, Manley travelled to Britain and visited [[Birmingham]]. He attended a number of venues including the Afro Caribbean Resource Centre in [[Winson Green]] and [[Digbeth Civic Hall]]. The mainly black audiences turned out ''en masse'' to hear Manley speak.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Meanwhile, Seaga's failure to deliver on his promises to the US and foreign investors, as well as complaints of governmental incompetence in the wake [[Hurricane Gilbert]]'s devastation in 1988, also contributed to his defeat by the popular Manley in the [[1989 Jamaican general election|1989 elections]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Re-election==
By 1989, some right-wing critics had begun to assert that Manley had softened his [[socialist]] rhetoric, explicitly advocating a role for [[private enterprise]].<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/> After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he also supposedly ceased his support for a variety of international causes. In the election of that year he campaigned on what appeared to be a more moderate platform.{{Opinion|date=February 2019}} Seaga's administration had fallen out of favour – both with the electorate and the US – and the PNP was elected. He was sworn in as a Member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] in 1989.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Manley's second term focused on liberalizing Jamaica's economy, with the pursuit of a neoliberal programme that stood in marked contrast to the more social democratic economic policies pursued by Manley's first government. Various measures were, however, undertaken to cushion the negative effects of austerity and structural adjustment. A Social Support Programme was introduced to provide welfare assistance for poor Jamaicans. In addition, the programme focused on creating direct employment, training, and credit for much of the population.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>

The government also announced a 50% increase in the amount of nutritional assistance for the most vulnerable groups (including pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children). A small number of community councils were also created. In addition, a limited land reform programme was carried out that leased and sold land to small farmers, and land plots were granted to hundreds of farmers. The government had an admirable record in housing provision, while measures were also taken to protect consumers from illegal and unfair business practices.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>

In 1992, citing health reasons, Manley stepped down as Prime Minister and PNP leader.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/><ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/political-career/|title=Political Leader|first=Peter Scott|last=Chrysalis|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> His former Deputy Prime Minister, [[Percival Patterson]], assumed both offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/|title=The Rt. Hon. Percival James Patterson (1935 - ) - The National Library of Jamaica|author=|date=|website=nlj.gov.jm|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>

==Family==
Michael Manley was married five times. In 1946, he married Jacqueline Kamellard, but the marriage was dissolved in 1951. In 1955 he married Thelma Verity the adopted daughter of Sir Philip Sherlock OM and his wife Grace Verity ; in 1960, this marriage was also dissolved. In 1966, Manley married Barbara Lewars (died in 1968); in 1972, he married Beverley Anderson, but the marriage was dissolved in 1990. Beverly wrote ''The Manley Memoirs'' in June 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2008/08/05/personal_politics_the_manley_memoirs/|title=Personal Politics: 'The Manley Memoirs'|website=Washington Post}}</ref> Michael Manley's final marriage was to Glynne Ewart in 1992.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-michael-manley-1271652.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Obituary: Michael Manley | first=Anthony | last=Payne | date=8 March 1997 | access-date=12 May 2010}}</ref>

Manley had five children from his five marriages: [[Rachel Manley]]; Joseph Manley; Sarah Manley; Natasha Manley; and David Manley.<ref name=\"auto\"/>

==Retirement and death==
Manley wrote seven books, including the award-winning ''A History of West Indies Cricket'', in which he discussed the links between cricket and West Indian [[nationalism]].<ref>Michael Manley, ''A History of West Indies Cricket'' (London: Andre Deutsch, 1998).</ref> The other books he wrote include ''The Politics of Change'' (1974), ''A Voice in the Workplace'' (1975), ''The Search for Solutions, The Poverty of Nations, Up the Down Escalator, and Jamaica: Struggle in the Periphery''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/writer/|title=Writer|first=Peter Scott Chrysalis|last=Communications|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>

On 6 March 1997, Michael Manley died of prostate cancer, the same day as another [[Caribbean]] politician, [[Cheddi Jagan]] of Guyana.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cheddi-Jagan|title=Cheddi Jagan - premier, Guyana|author=|date=|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> He is interred at the [[National Heroes Park]], where his father Norman Manley is also interred.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historygreatest.com/national-heroes-park|title=National Heroes Park|date=26 October 2014}}</ref>

'''Michael Norman Manley''' [[Order of the Nation|ON]] [[Order of the Caribbean Community|OCC]] (10 December 1924 – 6 March 1997) was a [[Jamaica]]n politician who served as the fourth [[Prime Minister of Jamaica]] from 1972 to 1980 and from 1989 to 1992. Manley championed a [[democratic socialist]] program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20090308/focus/focus4.html |title=Michael Manley: nation-builder |author=Robert Buddan |publisher=[[Jamaica Gleaner]] |date=8 March 2009 |access-date=11 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061311/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20090308/focus/focus4.html |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> According to opinion polls, he remains one of Jamaica's most popular prime ministers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120812/focus/focus6.html |title=Where Would Jamaica Be Without Michael Manley? |work=Jamaica Gleaner|date=12 August 2012| access-date=11 March 2013}}</ref>

==Pre-political career==
Manley, who is the second son of  politician [[Norman Washington Manley]] and  [[Edna Manley]], attended [[Jamaica College]] and then served in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] during [[World War II]]. In 1945, he enrolled at the [[London School of Economics]]. He graduated in 1949, and returned to Jamaica to serve as an editor and columnist for the newspaper ''Public Opinion''. At about the same time, he became involved in the [[trade union]] movement, becoming a [[negotiation|negotiator]] for the [[National Workers Union (Jamaica)|National Workers Union]]. In August 1953, he became a full-time official of that union.<ref name=\"Lentz\">{{cite book|last=Lentz|first=Harris M., III|title=''Heads of States and Governments''|year=1994|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|location=[[Jefferson, NC]]|isbn=0-89950-926-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/headsofstatesgov00lent/page/451 451]–452|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/headsofstatesgov00lent}}</ref>

==Entry into politics==
When his father was elected premier of Jamaica in 1955, Manley resisted entering politics, not wanting to be seen as capitalizing on his family name. However, in 1962, he accepted an appointment to the Senate of the [[Parliament of Jamaica]]. He won election to the Jamaican House of Representatives for the Central Kingston constituency in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Manley|title=Michael Manley - prime minister of Jamaica|author=|date=|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/political-career/|title=Political Leader|first=Peter Scott Chrysalis|last=Communications|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>

After his father's retirement in 1969, Manley was elected leader of the [[People's National Party]], defeating [[Vivian Blake (politician)|Vivian Blake]].<ref name=\"Waters\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3tmxS6La_EC&pg=PA98|first=Anita M.|last=Waters|title=Race, Class, and Political Symbols: Rastafari and Reggae in Jamaican Politics|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1985|page=98|access-date=8 July 2012}}</ref> He then served as [[Leader of the Opposition (Jamaica)|leader of the Opposition]], until his party won in the general elections of 1972.<ref name=\"Lentz\"/>

==Domestic reforms==
In the election of 1972, Manley defeated the unpopular incumbent Prime Minister, [[Hugh Shearer]], as his People's National Party swept to a landslide victory with 37 of 53 seats.<ref name=\"auto\"/>

He instituted a series of socio-economic reforms that produced mixed results. Although he was a Jamaican from an elite family, Manley's successful [[trade union]] background helped him to maintain a close relationship with the country's poor majority, and he was a dynamic, popular leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/trade-unionist/|title=Trade Unionist|first=Peter Scott Chrysalis|last=Communications|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> Unlike his father, who had a reputation for being formal and businesslike, the younger Manley moved easily among people of all strata and made Parliament accessible to the people by abolishing the requirement for men to wear [[jacket]]s and [[Necktie|ties]] to its sittings. In this regard he started a fashion revolution, often preferring the [[Kariba suit]], a type of formal bush jacket suit with trousers and worn without a shirt and tie.<ref name=\"auto\"/>

Under Manley, Jamaica established a minimum wage for all workers, including domestic workers.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Michael-Manley---the-visionary-who-will-never-be|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|author=|date=|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> In 1974, Manley proposed free education from primary school to university. The introduction of universally free secondary education was a major step in removing the institutional barriers to private sector and preferred government jobs that required secondary diplomas.<ref>Ewart Walters, ''We Come From Jamaica''  (Ottawa: Boyd McRubie, 2014), p. 198</ref> The PNP government in 1974 also formed the Jamaica Movement for the Advancement of Literacy (JAMAL), which administered adult education programs with the goal of involving 100,000 adults a year.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/>

Land reform expanded under his administration. Historically, land tenure in Jamaica has been rather inequitable. Project Land Lease (introduced in 1973), attempted an integrated rural development approach, providing tens of thousands of small farmers with land, technical advice, inputs such as fertilizers, and access to credit.<ref>Walters, p. 198</ref> An estimated 14 percent of idle land was redistributed through this program, much of which had been abandoned during the post-war urban migration or purchased by large [[bauxite]] companies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The minimum voting age was lowered to 18 years, while equal pay for women was introduced.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Insight Guide: Jamaica'', Insight Guides, APA Publications, 2009.</ref> Maternity leave was also introduced, while the government outlawed the stigma of illegitimacy. The [[Masters and Servants Act]] was abolished, and a Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Act provided workers and their trade unions with enhanced rights. The National Housing Trust was established, providing \"the means for most employed people to own their own homes,\" and greatly stimulated housing construction, with more than 40,000 houses built between 1974 and 1980.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>

Subsidised meals, transportation and uniforms for schoolchildren from disadvantaged backgrounds were introduced,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> together with free education at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Chuck Stewart, ''The Greenwood Encyclopaedia of LGBT Issues Worldwide'', Volume 1.</ref> Special employment programmes were also launched,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Kari Levitt, ''Reclaiming Development: independent thought and Caribbean community''.</ref> together with programmes designed to combat illiteracy.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Increases in pensions and poor relief were carried out,<ref name=Kaufman>Michael Kaufman, ''Jamaica under Manley: dilemmas of socialism and democracy''.</ref> along with a reform of local government taxation, an increase in youth training,<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> an expansion of day care centres.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> and an upgrading of hospitals.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\">Euclid A. Rose, ''Dependency and Socialism in the Modern Caribbean: Superpower Intervention in Guyana, Jamaica and Grenada, 1970-1985''.</ref>

A worker's participation programme was introduced,<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">David Panton, ''Jamaica’s Michael Manley: The Great Transformation (1972-92)''.</ref> together with a new mental health law<ref name=\"ReferenceE\">Darrell E. Levi, ''Michael Manley: the making of a leader''.</ref> and the family court.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> Free health care for all Jamaicans was introduced, while health clinics and a paramedical system in rural areas were established. Various clinics were also set up to facilitate access to medical drugs. Spending on education was significantly increased, while the number of doctors and dentists in the country rose.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> Project Lend Lease, an agricultural programme designed to provide rural labourers and smallholders with more land through tenancy, was introduced, together with a National Youth Service Programme for high school graduates to teach in schools, vocational training, and the literacy programme, comprehensive rent and price controls, protection for workers against unfair dismissal, subsidies (in 1973) on basic food items,<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> and the automatic recognition of unions in the workplace.<ref name=Kaufman />

Manley was the first Jamaican prime minister to support [[Jamaican republicanism]] (the replacement of the [[Monarchy of Jamaica|constitutional monarchy]] with a republic). In 1975, his government established a commission into constitutional reform, which recommended that Jamaica become a republic. In July 1977, after a march to commemorate the [[Morant Bay Rebellion]], Manley announced that Jamaica would become a republic by 1981. This did not occur, however.<ref name=\"burke\">Michael Burke, [http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Queen--emperor-and-republican-status_58297 \"Queen, emperor and republican status\"], ''[[The Jamaica Observer]]'', 21 April 2016.

==Diplomacy==
[[File:Mrs. Michael Manley, Prime Minister Michael Manley and Jimmy Carter during an Oval Office meeting 1977.png|thumb|Manley (age 52) and his fourth wife Beverly with US president [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1977]]

Manley developed close friendships with several foreign leaders, foremost of whom were [[Julius Nyerere]] of Tanzania, [[Olof Palme]] of Sweden, [[Pierre Trudeau]] of Canada and [[Fidel Castro]] of Cuba.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/world-statesman/|title=World Statesman|first=Peter Scott Chrysalis|last=Communications|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> With Cuba just {{convert|145|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Jamaica, he strengthened diplomatic relations between the two [[island]] nations, much to the dismay of [[United States]] policymakers.

In a speech given at the 1979 meeting of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], Manley strongly pressed for the development of what was called a natural alliance between the Non-Aligned movement and the Soviet Union to battle imperialism: <blockquote>\"All anti-imperialists know that the balance of forces in the world shifted irrevocably in 1917 when there was a movement and a man in the October Revolution, and Lenin was the man.\"<ref>Anthony Livingston Hall, ''The Ipinions Journals, Commentaries on Current Events,'' Vol. II (Lincoln, 2007), p. 240</ref></blockquote> Despite some international opposition, Manley deepened and strengthened Jamaica's ties with Cuba.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/>

In diplomatic affairs, Manley believed in respecting the different systems of government of other countries and not interfering in their internal affairs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Violence==
Manley was Prime Minister when Jamaica experienced a significant escalation of its political culture of violence. Supporters of his opponent [[Edward Seaga]] and the [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP) and Manley's [[People's National Party]] (PNP) engaged in a bloody struggle which began before the 1976 election and ended when Seaga was installed as Prime Minister in 1980. While the violent political culture was not invented by Seaga or Manley, and had its roots in conflicts between the parties from as early as the beginning of the [[two-party system]] in the 1940s, political violence reached unprecedented levels in the 1970s. Indeed, the two elections accompanied by the greatest violence were those (1976 and 1980) in which Seaga was trying to unseat Manley.<ref>Walters, pp. 200-5.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10173302|title=Jamaica violence 'linked to US drug market'|first=Jon|last=Silverman|date=27 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

In response to a wave of killings in 1974, Manley oversaw the passage of the [[Gun Court]] Act and the Suppression of Crime Act, giving the police and the army new powers to seal off and disarm high-violence neighborhoods. The Gun Court imposed a mandatory sentence of indefinite imprisonment with hard labour for all firearms offences, and ordinarily tried cases ''[[in camera]]'', without a jury.  Manley declared that \"There is no place in this society for the gun, now or ever.\"<ref name=\"time\">{{cite news|title=Stalag in Kingston|work=[[Time Magazine]]|date=23 September 1974|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908746,00.html|access-date=14 January 2009}}</ref>

Violence flared in January 1976 in anticipation of elections. A [[state of emergency]] was declared by Manley's party the PNP in June and 500 people, including some prominent members of the JLP, were accused of trying to overthrow the government and were detained, without charges, in the [[South Camp Adult Correctional Centre|South Camp Prison]] at the [[Up-Park Camp]] military headquarters.<ref name=\"jg\">''The Daily Gleaner'', Monday, 6 July 1986, p. 14.</ref> Elections were held on 15 December that year, while the state of emergency was still in effect. The PNP was returned to office. The state of emergency continued into the next year. Extraordinary powers granted the police by the Suppression of Crime Act of 1974 continued to the end of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Can-we-really-entrust-the-JCF-with-the-anti-gang-legislation-_16149216|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|author=|date=|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>

Violence continued to blight political life in the 1970s. Gangs armed by both parties fought for control of urban constituencies. In the election year of 1980 over 800 Jamaicans were killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/The-bloody-general-election-that-changed-Jamaica|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|author=|date=|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> Jamaicans were particularly shocked by the violence at that time.

In the 1980 elections, Seaga's JLP won and he became Prime Minister.

==Opposition==
As [[Official opposition|Leader of the Opposition]] Manley became an outspoken critic of the new conservative administration. He strongly opposed intervention in Grenada after Prime Minister [[Maurice Bishop]] was overthrown and executed. Immediately after committing Jamaican troops to [[Invasion of Grenada|Grenada]] in 1983, Seaga called a snap election – two years early – on the pretext that Dr Paul Robertson, General Secretary of the PNP, had called for his resignation. Manley, who may have been taken by surprise by the maneuver, led his party in a boycott of the elections, and so the Jamaica Labour Party won all seats in parliament against only marginal opposition in six of the sixty electoral constituencies.<ref name=\"auto\"/>

Manley was largely opposed by the United States government for conducting close relations with Fidel Castro and Cuba during the Cold War. Manley allowed Cuban technicians to work on Jamaican soil for projects. In 1977, Manley visited President Jimmy Carter at the White House to remedy the situation. Details of the meeting, however, were never disclosed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

During his period of opposition in the 1980s, Manley, a compelling speaker,{{Opinion|date=February 2019}} travelled extensively, speaking to audiences around the world. He taught a graduate seminar and gave a series of public lectures at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 1986, Manley travelled to Britain and visited [[Birmingham]]. He attended a number of venues including the Afro Caribbean Resource Centre in [[Winson Green]] and [[Digbeth Civic Hall]]. The mainly black audiences turned out ''en masse'' to hear Manley speak.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Meanwhile, Seaga's failure to deliver on his promises to the US and foreign investors, as well as complaints of governmental incompetence in the wake [[Hurricane Gilbert]]'s devastation in 1988, also contributed to his defeat by the popular Manley in the [[1989 Jamaican general election|1989 elections]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Re-election==
By 1989, some right-wing critics had begun to assert that Manley had softened his [[socialist]] rhetoric, explicitly advocating a role for [[private enterprise]].<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/> After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he also supposedly ceased his support for a variety of international causes. In the election of that year he campaigned on what appeared to be a more moderate platform.{{Opinion|date=February 2019}} Seaga's administration had fallen out of favour – both with the electorate and the US – and the PNP was elected. He was sworn in as a Member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] in 1989.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Manley's second term focused on liberalizing Jamaica's economy, with the pursuit of a neoliberal programme that stood in marked contrast to the more social democratic economic policies pursued by Manley's first government. Various measures were, however, undertaken to cushion the negative effects of austerity and structural adjustment. A Social Support Programme was introduced to provide welfare assistance for poor Jamaicans. In addition, the programme focused on creating direct employment, training, and credit for much of the population.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>

The government also announced a 50% increase in the amount of nutritional assistance for the most vulnerable groups (including pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children). A small number of community councils were also created. In addition, a limited land reform programme was carried out that leased and sold land to small farmers, and land plots were granted to hundreds of farmers. The government had an admirable record in housing provision, while measures were also taken to protect consumers from illegal and unfair business practices.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>

In 1992, citing health reasons, Manley stepped down as Prime Minister and PNP leader.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/><ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/political-career/|title=Political Leader|first=Peter Scott|last=Chrysalis|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> His former Deputy Prime Minister, [[Percival Patterson]], assumed both offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/|title=The Rt. Hon. Percival James Patterson (1935 - ) - The National Library of Jamaica|author=|date=|website=nlj.gov.jm|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>

==Family==
Michael Manley was married five times. In 1946, he married Jacqueline Kamellard, but the marriage was dissolved in 1951. In 1955 he married Thelma Verity the adopted daughter of Sir Philip Sherlock OM and his wife Grace Verity ; in 1960, this marriage was also dissolved. In 1966, Manley married Barbara Lewars (died in 1968); in 1972, he married Beverley Anderson, but the marriage was dissolved in 1990. Beverly wrote ''The Manley Memoirs'' in June 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2008/08/05/personal_politics_the_manley_memoirs/|title=Personal Politics: 'The Manley Memoirs'|website=Washington Post}}</ref> Michael Manley's final marriage was to Glynne Ewart in 1992.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-michael-manley-1271652.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Obituary: Michael Manley | first=Anthony | last=Payne | date=8 March 1997 | access-date=12 May 2010}}</ref>

Manley had five children from his five marriages: [[Rachel Manley]]; Joseph Manley; Sarah Manley; Natasha Manley; and David Manley.<ref name=\"auto\"/>

==Retirement and death==
Manley wrote seven books, including the award-winning ''A History of West Indies Cricket'', in which he discussed the links between cricket and West Indian [[nationalism]].<ref>Michael Manley, ''A History of West Indies Cricket'' (London: Andre Deutsch, 1998).</ref> The other books he wrote include ''The Politics of Change'' (1974), ''A Voice in the Workplace'' (1975), ''The Search for Solutions, The Poverty of Nations, Up the Down Escalator, and Jamaica: Struggle in the Periphery''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/writer/|title=Writer|first=Peter Scott Chrysalis|last=Communications|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>

Indian elephants have smaller ears, but relatively broader [[skull]]s and larger trunks than African elephants. Toes are large and broad. Unlike their African cousins, their [[abdomen]] is proportionate with their body weight but the African elephant has a large abdomen as compared to the skulls.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== Ecology and behaviour ==
[[File:Wild Elephant by N A Nazeer.jpg|thumb|Wild Indian Elephants]]
Elephants are classified as [[megaherbivore]]s and consume up to {{convert|150|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of plant matter per day.<ref>Samansiri, K. A. P., Weerakoon, D. K. (2007). [http://www.asesg.org/PDFfiles/Gajah/27-27-Samansiri.pdf ''Feeding Behaviour of Asian Elephants in the Northwestern Region of Sri Lanka'']. Gajah: Journal of the IUCN/SSC Asian Elephant Specialist Group. Number 2: 27–34</ref> They are generalist feeders, and both [[Grazing|grazers]] and [[Browsing (predation)|browsers]]. In a study area of {{convert|1130|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in southern India, elephants were recorded to feed on 112 different plant species, most commonly of the order [[Malvales]], and the [[Leguminosae|legume]], [[Palmae|palm]], [[Cyperaceae|sedge]] and [[Graminae|true grass]] families. They graze on the [[Themeda|tall grasses]], but the portion consumed varies with season. When the new flush appears in April, they remove the tender blades in small clumps. Later, when grasses are higher than {{convert|0.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, they uproot entire clumps, dust them skilfully and consume the fresh leave tops, but discard the roots. When grasses are mature in autumn, they clean and consume the succulent basal portions with the roots, and discard the fibrous blades. From the [[bamboo]]s, they eat seedlings, culms and lateral shoots. During the dry season from January to April, they mainly browse on both leaves and twigs preferring the fresh foliage, and consume thorn bearing shoots of [[acacia]] species without any obvious discomfort. They feed on the bark of [[Acacia suma|white thorn]] and other flowering plants, and consume the fruits of [[Limonia (plant)|wood apple]], [[tamarind]], [[Careya arborea|kumbhi]] and [[Phoenix (plant)|date palm]].<ref>Sukumar, R. (1990). [http://www.asiannature.org/pdf_resources/JournalofTropicalEcologyB1989.pdf ''Ecology of the Asian Elephant in southern India. II.

Journal of Tropical Ecology (1990) 6: 33–53.</ref>

In Nepal's [[Bardia National Park]], elephants consume large amounts of the [[Saccharum spontaneum|floodplain grass]], particularly during the [[monsoon]] season. They browse more in the dry season with bark constituting a major part of their diet in the cool part of that season.<ref>Pradhan, N.M.B., Wegge, P., Moe, S.R., Shrestha, A.K. (2008). [http://www.wildlifebiology.com/Downloads/Article/711/En/pradhan%20et%20al.pdf ''Feeding ecology of two endangered sympatric megaherbivores: Asian elephant Elephas maximus and greater one-horned rhinoceros Rhinoceros unicornis in lowland Nepal'']. Wildlife Biology 14: 147–154.</ref> During a study in a tropical moist mixed deciduous forested area of {{convert|160|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in [[Assam]], elephants were observed to feed on about 20 species of grasses, plants and trees. Grasses such as ''[[Imperata cylindrica]]'' and ''[[Leersia]] hexandra'' constituted by far the most predominant component of their diet.<ref>Borah, J., Deka, K. (2008).

The movement and habitat utilisation patterns of an elephant population were studied in southern India during 1981–83 within a {{convert|1130|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} study area. The vegetation types of this area encompasses dry [[thorn forest]] at {{convert|250|to|400|m|ft|abbr=on}}, [[deciduous forest]] at {{convert|400|to|1400|m|ft|abbr=on}}, stunted [[evergreen forest]] and grassland at {{convert|1400|to|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Five different elephant clans, each consisting of between 50 and 200 individuals had home ranges of between {{convert|105|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|320|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, which overlapped. They preferred habitat where water was available and food plants were palatable. During the dry months of January to April, they congregated at high densities of up to five individuals per km<sup>2</sup> in river valleys where [[browse]] plants had a much higher [[protein]] content than the coarse tall grasses on hill slopes. With the onset of rains in May, they dispersed over a wider area at lower densities, largely into the tall grass forests, to feed on the fresh grasses, which then had a high protein value. During the second wet season from September to December, when the tall grasses became fibrous, they moved into lower elevation short grass open forests. The normal movement pattern could be upset during years of adverse environmental conditions. However, the movement pattern of elephants in this region has not basically changed for over a century, as inferred from descriptions recorded during the 19th century.<ref>Sukumar, R. (1989). [http://www.asiannature.org/pdf_resources/JournalofTropicalEcologyA1989.pdf ''Ecology of the Asian elephant in southern India. l.

In the [[Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve]] three elephant clans had overall home ranges of {{convert|562|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, {{convert|670|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|799|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in the beginning of the 1990s. During three years of survey, their annual home ranges overlapped to a large extent with only minor shifts in the home ranges between years.<ref>Baskaran, N., Desai, A. A. (1996).

The pre-eminent threats to Asian elephants today are habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, which are driven by an expanding human population, and lead in turn to increasing conflicts between humans and elephants when elephants eat or trample crops.<ref name=iucn/> Loss of significant extents of elephant range and suitable habitat continues; their free movement is impeded by reservoirs, [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] projects and associated canals, irrigation dams, numerous pockets of cultivation and plantations, highways, railway lines, mining and [[industrial development]].<ref name=\"sukumar93\" />

[[Poaching]] of elephants for [[ivory]] is a serious threat in some parts of Asia. Poaching of tuskers impacts on sex ratios that become highly female biased; [[genetic variation]] is reduced, and [[fecundity]] and recruitment may decline.<ref name=\"sukumar93\" /> Poaching has dramatically skewed adult sex ratios in the [[Periyar Tiger Reserve]], where between 1969 and 1989 the adult male:female sex ratio changed from 1:6 to 1:122.<ref>Chandran, P. M. (1990). ''Population dynamics of elephants in Periyar Tiger Reserve''. Pages 51–56 in: C. K. Karunakaran (ed.) ''Proceedings of the Symposium on Ecology, Behaviour and Management of Elephants in Kerala''. Kerala Forest Department, Trivandrum, India.</ref>

Elephant conservation in northern [[West Bengal]] has been set back due to high-levels of human–elephant conflict and elephant mortality owing to railway accidents. The railway track between [[Siliguri]] and [[Alipurduar]] passes through {{convert|74|km|mi|abbr=on}} of various forest divisions. Every day, 20 trains run on this track at high speeds. Elephants that pass through from one forest patch to another dash against the trains and die. A total of 39 dead elephants were reported during the period of 1958 to 2008, of which ten were reported killed between 2004 and 2008.<ref>Roy, M. Baskaran, N., Sukumar, R. (2009).

In Bangladesh, forested areas that served as prime elephant habitat have undergone drastic reduction, which had a severe impact on the wild elephant population. Habitat loss and fragmentation is attributed to the increasing human population and its need for fuel wood and timber. [[Illegal logging|Illegal timber extraction]] plays a significant role in deforestation and habitat degradation. As a result of the shrinking habitat, elephants have become more and more prone to coming into direct conflict with humans.<ref name=\"Islam06\">Islam, M.&ndash;A. (2006).

In Myanmar, demand for elephant ivory for making tourist items is higher than ever before. The military government shows little interest in reducing the [[ivory trade]], while the elephants in the country have become the silent victims. After the worldwide ivory ban, prices of raw ivory in the country skyrocketed from $76 a kilo for large tusks in 1989/90 to over $200 a kilo by the mid-1990s. Foreign tourists are responsible for the massive rise in price of ivory tusks which fuels the [[Poaching|illegal killing]] of elephants. There is also a sizeable trade in ivory chopsticks and carvings, [[Wildlife trade#Illegal wildlife trade|smuggled]] by traders from Myanmar into China.<ref>Vigne, L., Martin, E. (2002).

Indian elephants have smaller ears, but relatively broader [[skull]]s and larger trunks than African elephants. Toes are large and broad. Unlike their African cousins, their [[abdomen]] is proportionate with their body weight but the African elephant has a large abdomen as compared to the skulls.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== Ecology and behaviour ==
[[File:Wild Elephant by N A Nazeer.jpg|thumb|Wild Indian Elephants]]
Elephants are classified as [[megaherbivore]]s and consume up to {{convert|150|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of plant matter per day.<ref>Samansiri, K. A. P., Weerakoon, D. K. (2007). [http://www.asesg.org/PDFfiles/Gajah/27-27-Samansiri.pdf ''Feeding Behaviour of Asian Elephants in the Northwestern Region of Sri Lanka'']. Gajah: Journal of the IUCN/SSC Asian Elephant Specialist Group. Number 2: 27–34</ref> They are generalist feeders, and both [[Grazing|grazers]] and [[Browsing (predation)|browsers]]. In a study area of {{convert|1130|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in southern India, elephants were recorded to feed on 112 different plant species, most commonly of the order [[Malvales]], and the [[Leguminosae|legume]], [[Palmae|palm]], [[Cyperaceae|sedge]] and [[Graminae|true grass]] families. They graze on the [[Themeda|tall grasses]], but the portion consumed varies with season. When the new flush appears in April, they remove the tender blades in small clumps. Later, when grasses are higher than {{convert|0.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, they uproot entire clumps, dust them skilfully and consume the fresh leave tops, but discard the roots. When grasses are mature in autumn, they clean and consume the succulent basal portions with the roots, and discard the fibrous blades. From the [[bamboo]]s, they eat seedlings, culms and lateral shoots. During the dry season from January to April, they mainly browse on both leaves and twigs preferring the fresh foliage, and consume thorn bearing shoots of [[acacia]] species without any obvious discomfort. They feed on the bark of [[Acacia suma|white thorn]] and other flowering plants, and consume the fruits of [[Limonia (plant)|wood apple]], [[tamarind]], [[Careya arborea|kumbhi]] and [[Phoenix (plant)|date palm]].<ref>Sukumar, R. (1990). [http://www.asiannature.org/pdf_resources/JournalofTropicalEcologyB1989.pdf ''Ecology of the Asian Elephant in southern India. II. Feeding habits and crop raiding patterns''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012123045/http://www.asiannature.org/pdf_resources/JournalofTropicalEcologyB1989.pdf |date=12 October 2007 }}. Journal of Tropical Ecology (1990) 6: 33–53.</ref>

In Nepal's [[Bardia National Park]], elephants consume large amounts of the [[Saccharum spontaneum|floodplain grass]], particularly during the [[monsoon]] season. They browse more in the dry season with bark constituting a major part of their diet in the cool part of that season.<ref>Pradhan, N.M.B., Wegge, P., Moe, S.R., Shrestha, A.K. (2008). [http://www.wildlifebiology.com/Downloads/Article/711/En/pradhan%20et%20al.pdf ''Feeding ecology of two endangered sympatric megaherbivores: Asian elephant Elephas maximus and greater one-horned rhinoceros Rhinoceros unicornis in lowland Nepal'']. Wildlife Biology 14: 147–154.</ref> During a study in a tropical moist mixed deciduous forested area of {{convert|160|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in [[Assam]], elephants were observed to feed on about 20 species of grasses, plants and trees. Grasses such as ''[[Imperata cylindrica]]'' and ''[[Leersia]] hexandra'' constituted by far the most predominant component of their diet.<ref>Borah, J., Deka, K. (2008).

The movement and habitat utilisation patterns of an elephant population were studied in southern India during 1981–83 within a {{convert|1130|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} study area. The vegetation types of this area encompasses dry [[thorn forest]] at {{convert|250|to|400|m|ft|abbr=on}}, [[deciduous forest]] at {{convert|400|to|1400|m|ft|abbr=on}}, stunted [[evergreen forest]] and grassland at {{convert|1400|to|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Five different elephant clans, each consisting of between 50 and 200 individuals had home ranges of between {{convert|105|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|320|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, which overlapped. They preferred habitat where water was available and food plants were palatable. During the dry months of January to April, they congregated at high densities of up to five individuals per km<sup>2</sup> in river valleys where [[browse]] plants had a much higher [[protein]] content than the coarse tall grasses on hill slopes. With the onset of rains in May, they dispersed over a wider area at lower densities, largely into the tall grass forests, to feed on the fresh grasses, which then had a high protein value. During the second wet season from September to December, when the tall grasses became fibrous, they moved into lower elevation short grass open forests. The normal movement pattern could be upset during years of adverse environmental conditions. However, the movement pattern of elephants in this region has not basically changed for over a century, as inferred from descriptions recorded during the 19th century.<ref>Sukumar, R. (1989). [http://www.asiannature.org/pdf_resources/JournalofTropicalEcologyA1989.pdf ''Ecology of the Asian elephant in southern India. l. Movement and habitat utilization patterns''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720175715/http://www.asiannature.org/pdf_resources/JournalofTropicalEcologyA1989.pdf |date=20 July 2011 }}. Journal of Tropical Ecology 5: 1–18.</ref>

In the [[Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve]] three elephant clans had overall home ranges of {{convert|562|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, {{convert|670|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|799|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in the beginning of the 1990s. During three years of survey, their annual home ranges overlapped to a large extent with only minor shifts in the home ranges between years.<ref>Baskaran, N., Desai, A. A. (1996).

== Threats ==

[[File:Chopsticks.jpg|thumb|Ivory chopsticks]]
The pre-eminent threats to Asian elephants today are habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, which are driven by an expanding human population, and lead in turn to increasing conflicts between humans and elephants when elephants eat or trample crops.<ref name=iucn/> Loss of significant extents of elephant range and suitable habitat continues; their free movement is impeded by reservoirs, [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] projects and associated canals, irrigation dams, numerous pockets of cultivation and plantations, highways, railway lines, mining and [[industrial development]].<ref name=\"sukumar93\" />

[[Poaching]] of elephants for [[ivory]] is a serious threat in some parts of Asia. Poaching of tuskers impacts on sex ratios that become highly female biased; [[genetic variation]] is reduced, and [[fecundity]] and recruitment may decline.<ref name=\"sukumar93\" /> Poaching has dramatically skewed adult sex ratios in the [[Periyar Tiger Reserve]], where between 1969 and 1989 the adult male:female sex ratio changed from 1:6 to 1:122.<ref>Chandran, P. M. (1990). ''Population dynamics of elephants in Periyar Tiger Reserve''. Pages 51–56 in: C. K. Karunakaran (ed.) ''Proceedings of the Symposium on Ecology, Behaviour and Management of Elephants in Kerala''. Kerala Forest Department, Trivandrum, India.</ref>

Elephant conservation in northern [[West Bengal]] has been set back due to high-levels of human–elephant conflict and elephant mortality owing to railway accidents. The railway track between [[Siliguri]] and [[Alipurduar]] passes through {{convert|74|km|mi|abbr=on}} of various forest divisions. Every day, 20 trains run on this track at high speeds. Elephants that pass through from one forest patch to another dash against the trains and die. A total of 39 dead elephants were reported during the period of 1958 to 2008, of which ten were reported killed between 2004 and 2008.<ref>Roy, M. Baskaran, N., Sukumar, R. (2009).

Gajah: Journal of the IUCN/SSC Asian Elephant Specialist Group 31: 36–39.</ref>

In Bangladesh, forested areas that served as prime elephant habitat have undergone drastic reduction, which had a severe impact on the wild elephant population. Habitat loss and fragmentation is attributed to the increasing human population and its need for fuel wood and timber. [[Illegal logging|Illegal timber extraction]] plays a significant role in deforestation and habitat degradation. As a result of the shrinking habitat, elephants have become more and more prone to coming into direct conflict with humans.<ref name=\"Islam06\">Islam, M.&ndash;A. (2006). [http://www.asesg.org/PDFfiles/Gajah/25-21-Islam.pdf ''Conservation of the Asian elephant in Bangladesh'']. Gajah: Journal of the IUCN/SSC Asian Elephant Specialist Group 25: 21–26.</ref>

In Myanmar, demand for elephant ivory for making tourist items is higher than ever before. The military government shows little interest in reducing the [[ivory trade]], while the elephants in the country have become the silent victims. After the worldwide ivory ban, prices of raw ivory in the country skyrocketed from $76 a kilo for large tusks in 1989/90 to over $200 a kilo by the mid-1990s. Foreign tourists are responsible for the massive rise in price of ivory tusks which fuels the [[Poaching|illegal killing]] of elephants. There is also a sizeable trade in ivory chopsticks and carvings, [[Wildlife trade#Illegal wildlife trade|smuggled]] by traders from Myanmar into China.<ref>Vigne, L., Martin, E. (2002). [http://www.asesg.org/PDFfiles/Gajah/21-85-Vigne.pdf ''Myanmar’s ivory trade threatens wild elephants'']. Gajah: Journal of the IUCN/SSC Asian Elephant Specialist Group 21: 85–86.</ref>

Young wild-born elephants are removed from their mothers in Myanmar for use in Thailand's tourism industry. Mothers are often killed in the process, and calves are placed alongside unrelated cows to suggest they are with their mothers.<ref name=dm120721>{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2176957/The-agonising-blows-expose-evil-secrets-Thailands-elephant-tourism-The-Duchess-Cornwalls-brother-tells-baby-elephants-brutally-starved-tortured.html | title = The agonising blows that expose the evil secrets of Thailand's elephant tourism con: The Duchess of Cornwall's brother tells how baby elephants are brutally starved and tortured | first = M. | last = Shand | work = Daily Mail | accessdate = 22 July 2012 | location=London | date=21 July 2012}}</ref> The calves are often subjected to a 'breaking in' process, which may involve being tied up, confined, starved, beaten and tortured, as a result of which two-thirds may perish.<ref name=guard120724>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/24/tourism-elephant-trade-burma-thailand | title = Tourism driving illegal elephant trade in Burma and Thailand – video | work = guardian.co.uk | date = 24 July 2012 | location=London}}</ref>

The '''Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party''' ('''MFDP'''), also referred to as the '''Freedom Democratic Party''', was an American [[political party]] created in 1964 as a branch of the [[populist]] Freedom Democratic organization in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Mississippi]] during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. It was organized by [[African American]]s and [[whites]] from [[Mississippi]] to challenge the established power of the [[Mississippi Democratic Party]], which at the time allowed participation only by whites, when African-Americans made up 40% of the state population.

==Origins==

==Building the party==
With partial participation in the regular Mississippi Democratic Party blocked by segregationists, the [[Council of Federated Organizations]] (COFO) built on the success of the Freedom Ballot by formally establishing the MFDP in April 1964 as a non-discriminatory, non-exclusionary rival to the regular party organization. The MFDP hoped to replace the regulars as the officially recognized Democratic Party organization in Mississippi by winning the Mississippi seats at the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]] for a slate of delegates elected by some black and white Mississippians and white sympathizers.

By the end of August 1964 the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party had gained so much attention nationally that its delegates had 80,000 members belonging to their racially integrated party.

In time some activists from the Northeast, including some of the [[Freedom Riders]], would come to dominate the administration of the new party. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

== State Convention in Jackson, Mississippi==
On August 4, before the state convention, the bodies of [[James Earl Chaney]], [[Michael Schwerner]] and [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]] were discovered buried in an earthen dam. They had been workers with [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]], registering people to vote for the MFDP, and had been murdered for their activism. Missing for weeks since disappearing after investigating a church burning in June 1964, they were subjects of a massive manhunt that involved the FBI and United States sailors from a nearby base. The [[murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner]] drew national attention and generated outrage, emboldening the MFDP to be the party to represent the state of Mississippi.<ref>{{cite book

On August 6, 1964, the MFDP held a statewide convention before attending the DNC; 2,500 people showed up at the [[Masonic Temple]]. They decided to take the party to the national credentials committee and attempt to be seated as the delegation from Mississippi.  [[Joseph Rauh]], the MFDP legal counsel and a foremost civil liberties attorney, spoke at the convention. He said that the MFDP was the only party in the state loyal to the national Democratic Party and that its chances of success were excellent.

Ella Baker was the keynote speaker at the state convention. She did not deliver the kind of address that the people were expecting on voting and rights but made a statement about society:

<blockquote>I'm not trying to make you feel good. We have to know what we are dealing with and we can't deal with things just because we feel we ought to have our rights. We have to deal with them on the basis of knowledge that we gain ... through sending our children through certain kinds of courses, through sitting down and reading at night instead of spending our time at the television and radio just listening to what's on. But we must spend our time reading some of things that help us to understand this South we live in.<ref>{{cite book

The state convention gave the MFDP confidence in their ability to effect change on the national level. They elected Fannie Lou Hamer, E.W. Steptoe, Winson Hudson, Hazel Palmer, [[Victoria Gray Adams|Victoria Gray]], [[Ed King (activist)|Rev. Ed King]], [[Aaron Henry]] and [[Annie Devine]] as <!-- what? -->electors from the state to the national convention. The day after the state convention, [[James Chaney]] was buried in his hometown of [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. [[Dave Dennis (civil rights activist)|Dave Dennis]] gave an impassioned speech about the loss of this young man.

<blockquote>Those are the people who don't care. ... That includes the President on down to the governor of the state of Mississippi ... I blame the people in Washington D.C., and on down in the state of Mississippi for what happened just as much as I blame those who pulled the trigger.&nbsp;...

In the face of unrelenting violence and economic retaliation by the [[White Citizens Council]], the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]], and other opponents, the MFDP held local caucuses, county assemblies, and a statewide convention (as prescribed by Democratic Party rules) to elect 68 delegates (including four whites) to the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]] scheduled for [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] in August.

==1964 Democratic National Convention==
[[File:Aaron Henry 1964.jpg|450px|thumb|right|Aaron Henry reading from a document while seated before the credentials committee]]
The MFDP sent its elected delegates by bus to the convention. They challenged the right of the Mississippi Democratic Party's delegation to participate in the convention, claiming that the regulars had been illegally elected in a completely segregated process that violated both party regulations and federal law, and that the regulars had no intention of supporting [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the party's presidential candidate, in the November election. They asked that the MFDP delegates be seated rather than the segregationist regulars.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/disc/mfdp.htm The Mississippi Movement & the MFDP] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>

Some of the original members of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegation in 1964 were [[Lawrence Guyot]], Peggy J. Conner, [[Victoria Gray Adams|Victoria Gray]], [[Ed King (activist)|Edwin King]], [[Aaron Henry]], Fannie Lou Hamer, [[Annie Devine]], and [[Bob Moses (activist)|Bob Moses]].<ref>{{cite book

[[Dr. Martin Luther King]] told President Johnson that he would \"do everything in my power to urge (The MFDP) being seated as the only democratically constituted delegation from Mississippi.\" King also voiced his support to Congress, \"I pledge myself and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to the fullest support of the challenges of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic party and call upon all Americans to join with me in this commitment.\"<ref name=king/>

The Democratic Party referred the challenge to the convention credentials committee. The MFDP delegates lobbied and argued their case, and large groups of supporters and volunteers established an around-the-clock picket line on the boardwalk just outside the convention. The MFDP prepared a legal brief detailing the reasons why the \"regular\" Mississippi delegation did not adequately represent their state's residents, including the tactics employed to exclude participation by Black citizens. [[Jack Minnis]] wrote, \"MFDP, with the help of SNCC, produced brochures, mimeographed biographies of the MFDP delegates, histories of the MFDP, legal arguments, historical arguments, moral arguments\" that were distributed to all of the Convention's delegates.<ref>Carmichael, Stokely, and Charles V.  Hamilton. ''Black Power: The Politics of Liberation,'' (New York: Random House, 1967), p. 90.</ref> Their actions attracted considerable publicity.

The credentials committee televised its proceedings, which allowed the nation to see and hear the testimony of the MFDP delegates, particularly the testimony of [[Fannie Lou Hamer]]. She gave a moving and evocative portrayal of her hard brutalized life as a [[sharecropper]] on a cotton [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] in the Mississippi Delta and the retaliation inflicted on her for trying to register to vote.<ref>{{cite book

After that, most knowledgeable observers{{who|date=September 2015}} thought the majority of the delegates were ready to unseat the regulars and seat the MFDP delegates in their place. But some{{which|date=September 2015}} of the all-white{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} delegations from other southern states threatened to leave the convention and bolt the party (as they had done in previous years){{when|date=September 2015}} if the regular Mississippi delegation was unseated. President Johnson had wanted a convention stressing unity and feared losing Southern support in the coming campaign against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate [[Barry Goldwater]]. To ensure his victory in November, Johnson maneuvered to prevent the MFDP from replacing the regulars. After a frantic scramble, he ordered the chairman of the credentials committee to avoid deciding the matter or sending the issue to the convention.

With the help of Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] (a potential candidate for [[vice president of the United States|vice president]]) and Party leader [[Walter Mondale]], Johnson engineered a \"compromise\" in which the national Democratic Party offered the MFDP two at-large seats, rather than replacing the regular Democratic delegates from their state. This allowed them to watch the floor proceedings but not take part. The MFDP refused this \"compromise,\" which permitted the white-only regulars, who had not been democratically elected, to keep their seats and denied votes to the MFDP.

MFDP leader and Mississippi NAACP President [[Aaron Henry]] stated:

<blockquote>Now, Lyndon made the typical white man's mistake: Not only did he say, 'You've got two votes,' which was too little, but he told us to whom the two votes would go. He'd give me one and [[Ed King (activist)|Ed King]] one; that would satisfy. But, you see, he didn't realize that sixty-four of us came up from Mississippi on a Greyhound bus, eating cheese and crackers and bologna all the way there; we didn't have no money. Suffering the same way. We got to [[Atlantic City]]; we put up in a little hotel, three or four of us in a bed, four or five of us on the floor. You know, we suffered a common kind of experience, the whole thing. But now, what kind of fool am I, or what kind of fool would Ed have been, to accept gratuities for ourselves? You say, Ed and Aaron can get in but the other sixty-two can't. This is typical white man picking black folks' leaders, and that day is just gone.</blockquote>

The MFDP was willing to accept a compromise proposed by Oregon Congresswoman [[Edith Green]], that \"loyal\" Democrats of both delegations be seated. This compromise was not accepted by the national party, which instead selected the \"regular\" party to represent the state of Mississippi, those whom, on July 28, 1964, had passed the following resolution:<ref>Carmichael and Hamilton p.92.</ref>

<blockquote>We opposed, condemn and deplore the Civil Rights Act of 1964&nbsp;... We believe in separation of the races in all phases of our society. It is our belief that the separation of the races is necessary for the peace and tranquility of all the people of Mississippi and the continuing good relationship which has existed over the years ...<ref>Carmichael and Hamilton p.93.</ref></blockquote>

The MFDP left the Convention rather than be compromised by accepting the two seats. President Johnson had tried to prevent Fannie Lou Hamer from making her speech. After the United States heard her speech, different parts of the population were outraged and began calling into the White House seeking justice for African Americans in the South. The next year President Johnson persuaded Congress to pass the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which authorized the federal government to oversee elections at the state and local level, and enforce practices that would support legitimate voter registration and voting in areas with an historic under-representation of certain parts of the population.<ref>{{cite news

Fannie Lou Hamer said, \"We didn't come all this way for no two seats, 'cause all of us is tired.\"<ref>Mills, Kay, ''This Little Light of Mine: The Life of Fannie Lou Hamer,'' (New York: Plume, 1994), p. 5.</ref>
Although denied official recognition, the MFDP kept up their agitation within the Convention. When all but three of the regular Mississippi delegates left because they refused to support Johnson against Goldwater, the Republican Party candidate, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic northern delegates and took the vacated seats. The national Party would not allow them to stay. The next day the MFDP delegates returned to discover that convention organizers had removed the empty seats; they stayed to sing freedom songs.

Johnson lost [[Mississippi]] in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]], as whites had still suppressed the black vote. White Democrats were becoming more conservative and voted for Goldwater. With the exception of the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 presidential election]], when favorite son [[Jimmy Carter]] of Georgia was the Democratic candidate, Mississippi has never voted for the Democratic presidential candidate since.

==Aftermath==

The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP. For a while, it became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited [[Malcolm X]] to speak and opposed the war in Vietnam.

For the better part of a year after hosting the statewide mock election in November 1964, most of the organization's efforts went into challenging the seating of the elected congresspersons of Mississippi to the U.S. House of Representatives. They argued to Congress that, because of the state's disfranchisement, half of the electorate was prevented from participating in the election of those representatives. The FDP had 149 votes in Congress supporting its position; however, the House leadership (dominated by senior Southern Democrats) and Johnson's White House were appalled at this idea and rejected overturning the Democratic representatives from Mississippi.<ref>{{cite book

Many Civil Rights Movement activists felt betrayed by Johnson, Humphrey, and the liberal establishment. The movement had been promised that if it concentrated on voter registration rather than protests, it would be supported by the federal government and the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. Instead, at the decisive moment, they believed that black civil rights and justice had been sacrificed for the political interests of white politicians. As SNCC Chairman [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] later wrote:

<blockquote>As far as I'm concerned, this was the turning point of the civil rights movement. I'm absolutely convinced of that. Until then, despite every setback and disappointment and obstacle we had faced over the years, the belief still prevailed that the system would work, the system would listen, the system would respond. Now, for the first time, we had made our way to the very center of the system. We had played by the rules, done everything we were supposed to do, had played the game exactly as required, had arrived at the doorstep and found the door slammed in our face.<ref>{{cite book

Though the MFDP failed to unseat the regulars at the convention, they did succeed in publicizing the violence and injustice by which the white power structure governed Mississippi and disenfranchised black citizens. The dramatic elements of the MFDP and its convention challenge eventually helped gain congressional passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

The MFDP actions resulted in the national party adopting a new policy: its credentials committee banned seating delegations that had been chosen through racial discrimination.<ref>{{cite book
  |last=Payne
  |first=Charles
  |title=I've Got the Light of Freedom: The organizing Tradition and the Mississippi Freedom Struggle
  |publisher=University of California
  |year=2007}}</ref> The MFDP continued as an alternate for several years as African Americans began to register and vote in the regular political system. Many of the people associated with it continued to press to implement civil rights in Mississippi. After passage of the Voting Rights Act, the number of registered black voters in Mississippi grew dramatically. The regular party stopped discriminating against blacks and agreed to conform to the Democratic Party rules guaranteeing fair participation. Eventually, the MFDP merged into the regular party and many MFDP activists became party leaders. The FDP has only one active chapter, in Holmes County.

After the MFDP was disbanded, many formed a new party, the Loyal Democrats of Mississippi. In 1968, they were successful at the DNC in being seated as the only delegation from Mississippi. Several of these delegates were members of the MFDP.<ref name=king>[https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/mississippi-freedom-democratic-party-mfdp Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party] ~ The Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education institute</ref>

Militants, including John Buffington ([[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|S. N. C. C.

Shields ([[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|S. N. C. C.

On 24 January 1970, the office of the Clay County Community Development Organization was [[firebombing|fire-bombed]]. The next day, [[dynamite]] exploded the Clay County Courthouse. Despite a finding of not guilty, John Thomas, Jr. was assassinated, several months later, in broad daylight.

==Building the party==
With partial participation in the regular Mississippi Democratic Party blocked by segregationists, the [[Council of Federated Organizations]] (COFO) built on the success of the Freedom Ballot by formally establishing the MFDP in April 1964 as a non-discriminatory, non-exclusionary rival to the regular party organization. The MFDP hoped to replace the regulars as the officially recognized Democratic Party organization in Mississippi by winning the Mississippi seats at the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]] for a slate of delegates elected by some black and white Mississippians and white sympathizers.

By thethe end of August 1964 the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party had gained so much attention nationally that its delegates had 80,000 members belonging to their racially integrated party.

In time some activists from the Northeast, including some of the [[Freedom Riders]], would come to dominate the administration of the new party. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

== State Convention in Jackson, Mississippi==
On August 4, before the state convention, the bodies of [[James Earl Chaney]], [[Michael Schwerner]] and [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]] were discovered buried in an earthen dam. They had been workers with [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]], registering people to vote for the MFDP, and had been murdered for their activism. Missing for weeks since disappearing after investigating a church burning in June 1964, they were subjects of a massive manhunt that involved the FBI and United States sailors from a nearby base. The [[murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner]] drew national attention and generated outrage, emboldening the MFDP to be the party to represent the state of Mississippi.<ref>{{cite book

On August 6, 1964, the MFDP held a statewide convention before attending the DNC; 2,500 people showed up at the [[Masonic Temple]]. They decided to take the party to the national credentials committee and attempt to be seated as the delegation from Mississippi.  [[Joseph Rauh]], the MFDP legal counsel and a foremost civil liberties attorney, spoke at the convention. He said that the MFDP was the only party in the state loyal to the national Democratic Party and that its chances of success were excellent.

Ella Baker was the keynote speaker at the state convention. She did not deliver the kind of address that the people were expecting on voting and rights but made a statement about society:

<blockquote>I'm not trying to make you feel good. We have to know what we are dealing with and we can't deal with things just because we feel we ought to have our rights. We have to deal with them on the basis of knowledge that we gain ... through sending our children through certain kinds of courses, through sitting down and reading at night instead of spending our time at the television and radio just listening to what's on. But we must spend our time reading some of things that help us to understand this South we live in.<ref>{{cite book

The state convention gave the MFDP confidence in their ability to effect change on the national level. They elected Fannie Lou Hamer, E.W. Steptoe, Winson Hudson, Hazel Palmer, [[Victoria Gray Adams|Victoria Gray]], [[Ed King (activist)|Rev. Ed King]], [[Aaron Henry]] and [[Annie Devine]] as <!-- what? -->electors from the state to the national convention. The day after the state convention, [[James Chaney]] was buried in his hometown of [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. [[Dave Dennis (civil rights activist)|Dave Dennis]] gave an impassioned speech about the loss of this young man.

<blockquote>Those are the people who don't care. ... That includes the President on down to the governor of the state of Mississippi ... I blame the people in Washington D.C., and on down in the state of Mississippi for what happened just as much as I blame those who pulled the trigger.&nbsp;...

In the face of unrelenting violence and economic retaliation by the [[White Citizens Council]], the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]], and other opponents, the MFDP held local caucuses, county assemblies, and a statewide convention (as prescribed by Democratic Party rules) to elect 68 delegates (including four whites) to the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]] scheduled for [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] in August.

==1964 Democratic National Convention==
[[File:Aaron Henry 1964.jpg|450px|thumb|right|Aaron Henry reading from a document while seated before the credentials committee]]
The MFDP sent its elected delegates by bus to the convention. They challenged the right of the Mississippi Democratic Party's delegation to participate in the convention, claiming that the regulars had been illegally elected in a completely segregated process that violated both party regulations and federal law, and that the regulars had no intention of supporting [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the party's presidential candidate, in the November election. They asked that the MFDP delegates be seated rather than the segregationist regulars.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/disc/mfdp.htm The Mississippi Movement & the MFDP] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>

Some of the original members of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegation in 1964 were [[Lawrence Guyot]], Peggy J. Conner, [[Victoria Gray Adams|Victoria Gray]], [[Ed King (activist)|Edwin King]], [[Aaron Henry]], Fannie Lou Hamer, [[Annie Devine]], and [[Bob Moses (activist)|Bob Moses]].<ref>{{cite book

[[Dr. Martin Luther King]] told President Johnson that he would \"do everything in my power to urge (The MFDP) being seated as the only democratically constituted delegation from Mississippi.\" King also voiced his support to Congress, \"I pledge myself and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to the fullest support of the challenges of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic party and call upon all Americans to join with me in this commitment.\"<ref name=king/>

The Democratic Party referred the challenge to the convention credentials committee. The MFDP delegates lobbied and argued their case, and large groups of supporters and volunteers established an around-the-clock picket line on the boardwalk just outside the convention. The MFDP prepared a legal brief detailing the reasons why the \"regular\" Mississippi delegation did not adequately represent their state's residents, including the tactics employed to exclude participation by Black citizens. [[Jack Minnis]] wrote, \"MFDP, with the help of SNCC, produced brochures, mimeographed biographies of the MFDP delegates, histories of the MFDP, legal arguments, historical arguments, moral arguments\" that were distributed to all of the Convention's delegates.<ref>Carmichael, Stokely, and Charles V.  Hamilton. ''Black Power: The Politics of Liberation,'' (New York: Random House, 1967), p. 90.</ref> Their actions attracted considerable publicity.

The credentials committee televised its proceedings, which allowed the nation to see and hear the testimony of the MFDP delegates, particularly the testimony of [[Fannie Lou Hamer]]. She gave a moving and evocative portrayal of her hard brutalized life as a [[sharecropper]] on a cotton [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] in the Mississippi Delta and the retaliation inflicted on her for trying to register to vote.<ref>{{cite book

After that, most knowledgeable observers{{who|date=September 2015}} thought the majority of the delegates were ready to unseat the regulars and seat the MFDP delegates in their place. But some{{which|date=September 2015}} of the all-white{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} delegations from other southern states threatened to leave the convention and bolt the party (as they had done in previous years){{when|date=September 2015}} if the regular Mississippi delegation was unseated. President Johnson had wanted a convention stressing unity and feared losing Southern support in the coming campaign against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate [[Barry Goldwater]]. To ensure his victory in November, Johnson maneuvered to prevent the MFDP from replacing the regulars. After a frantic scramble, he ordered the chairman of the credentials committee to avoid deciding the matter or sending the issue to the convention.

With the help of Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] (a potential candidate for [[vice president of the United States|vice president]]) and Party leader [[Walter Mondale]], Johnson engineered a \"compromise\" in which the national Democratic Party offered the MFDP two at-large seats, rather than replacing the regular Democratic delegates from their state. This allowed them to watch the floor proceedings but not take part. The MFDP refused this \"compromise,\" which permitted the white-only regulars, who had not been democratically elected, to keep their seats and denied votes to the MFDP.

MFDP leader and Mississippi NAACP President [[Aaron Henry]] stated:

<blockquote>Now, Lyndon made the typical white man's mistake: Not only did he say, 'You've got two votes,' which was too little, but he told us to whom the two votes would go. He'd give me one and [[Ed King (activist)|Ed King]] one; that would satisfy. But, you see, he didn't realize that sixty-four of us came up from Mississippi on a Greyhound bus, eating cheese and crackers and bologna all the way there; we didn't have no money. Suffering the same way. We got to [[Atlantic City]]; we put up in a little hotel, three or four of us in a bed, four or five of us on the floor. You know, we suffered a common kind of experience, the whole thing. But now, what kind of fool am I, or what kind of fool would Ed have been, to accept gratuities for ourselves? You say, Ed and Aaron can get in but the other sixty-two can't. This is typical white man picking black folks' leaders, and that day is just gone.</blockquote>

The MFDP was willing to accept a compromise proposed by Oregon Congresswoman [[Edith Green]], that \"loyal\" Democrats of both delegations be seated. This compromise was not accepted by the national party, which instead selected the \"regular\" party to represent the state of Mississippi, those whom, on July 28, 1964, had passed the following resolution:<ref>Carmichael and Hamilton p.92.</ref>

<blockquote>We opposed, condemn and deplore the Civil Rights Act of 1964&nbsp;... We believe in separation of the races in all phases of our society. It is our belief that the separation of the races is necessary for the peace and tranquility of all the people of Mississippi and the continuing good relationship which has existed over the years ...<ref>Carmichael and Hamilton p.93.</ref></blockquote>

The MFDP left the Convention rather than be compromised by accepting the two seats. President Johnson had tried to prevent Fannie Lou Hamer from making her speech. After the United States heard her speech, different parts of the population were outraged and began calling into the White House seeking justice for African Americans in the South. The next year President Johnson persuaded Congress to pass the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which authorized the federal government to oversee elections at the state and local level, and enforce practices that would support legitimate voter registration and voting in areas with an historic under-representation of certain parts of the population.<ref>{{cite news

Fannie Lou Hamer said, \"We didn't come all this way for no two seats, 'cause all of us is tired.\"<ref>Mills, Kay, ''This Little Light of Mine: The Life of Fannie Lou Hamer,'' (New York: Plume, 1994), p. 5.</ref>
Although denied official recognition, the MFDP kept up their agitation within the Convention. When all but three of the regular Mississippi delegates left because they refused to support Johnson against Goldwater, the Republican Party candidate, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic northern delegates and took the vacated seats. The national Party would not allow them to stay. The next day the MFDP delegates returned to discover that convention organizers had removed the empty seats; they stayed to sing freedom songs.

Johnson lost [[Mississippi]] in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]], as whites had still suppressed the black vote. White Democrats were becoming more conservative and voted for Goldwater. With the exception of the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 presidential election]], when favorite son [[Jimmy Carter]] of Georgia was the Democratic candidate, Mississippi has never voted for the Democratic presidential candidate since.

==Aftermath==

The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP. For a while, it became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited [[Malcolm X]] to speak and opposed the war in Vietnam.

For the better part of a year after hosting the statewide mock election in November 1964, most of the organization's efforts went into challenging the seating of the elected congresspersons of Mississippi to the U.S. House of Representatives. They argued to Congress that, because of the state's disfranchisement, half of the electorate was prevented from participating in the election of those representatives. The FDP had 149 votes in Congress supporting its position; however, the House leadership (dominated by senior Southern Democrats) and Johnson's White House were appalled at this idea and rejected overturning the Democratic representatives from Mississippi.<ref>{{cite book

Many Civil Rights Movement activists felt betrayed by Johnson, Humphrey, and the liberal establishment. The movement had been promised that if it concentrated on voter registration rather than protests, it would be supported by the federal government and the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. Instead, at the decisive moment, they believed that black civil rights and justice had been sacrificed for the political interests of white politicians. As SNCC Chairman [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] later wrote:

<blockquote>As far as I'm concerned, this was the turning point of the civil rights movement. I'm absolutely convinced of that. Until then, despite every setback and disappointment and obstacle we had faced over the years, the belief still prevailed that the system would work, the system would listen, the system would respond. Now, for the first time, we had made our way to the very center of the system. We had played by the rules, done everything we were supposed to do, had played the game exactly as required, had arrived at the doorstep and found the door slammed in our face.<ref>{{cite book

Though the MFDP failed to unseat the regulars at the convention, they did succeed in publicizing the violence and injustice by which the white power structure governed Mississippi and disenfranchised black citizens. The dramatic elements of the MFDP and its convention challenge eventually helped gain congressional passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

The MFDP actions resulted in the national party adopting a new policy: its credentials committee banned seating delegations that had been chosen through racial discrimination.<ref>{{cite book
  |last=Payne
  |first=Charles
  |title=I've Got the Light of Freedom: The organizing Tradition and the Mississippi Freedom Struggle
  |publisher=University of California
  |year=2007}}</ref> The MFDP continued as an alternate for several years as African Americans began to register and vote in the regular political system. Many of the people associated with it continued to press to implement civil rights in Mississippi. After passage of the Voting Rights Act, the number of registered black voters in Mississippi grew dramatically. The regular party stopped discriminating against blacks and agreed to conform to the Democratic Party rules guaranteeing fair participation. Eventually, the MFDP merged into the regular party and many MFDP activists became party leaders. The FDP has only one active chapter, in Holmes County.

After the MFDP was disbanded, many formed a new party, the Loyal Democrats of Mississippi. In 1968, they were successful at the DNC in being seated as the only delegation from Mississippi. Several of these delegates were members of the MFDP.<ref name=king>[https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/mississippi-freedom-democratic-party-mfdp Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party] ~ The Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education institute</ref>

On 24 January 1970, the office of the Clay County Community Development Organization was [[firebombing|fire-bombed]]. The next day, [[dynamite]] exploded the Clay County Courthouse. Despite a finding of not guilty, John Thomas, Jr. was assassinated, several months later, in broad daylight.

=== 2017–2019: ''Broken Machine'' and ''What Did You Think When You Made Me This Way?'' ===
A small tour of UK clubs took place in late May 2017, to support \"Amsterdam,\" the first single from their second album ''[[Broken Machine (album)|Broken Machine]]'', released on 8 September 2017. On 5 August 2017 they played to a crowd of over 500,000 people at [[Woodstock Festival (Poland)|Woodstock Festival Poland]]. On 23 August 2017 they supported Muse and [[Biffy Clyro]] at [[Belfast Vital|Vital Festival]] in [[Belfast]]. Their UK 2017 tour was completely sold out. The band has also managed to sell out two consecutive nights at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] in London. Sarah Taylor said on Varsity \"In general, this album pushes more boundaries than the last one. The band carved a name for themselves with their debut, but here it feels like they’re trying to define themselves to a further extent; there’s more variety in the music and lyricism, and more politics, too. Joe Langridge-Brown, guitarist and lyricist alongside Mason, said that “all the songs on the album are things that we’ve gone through or spoken about: Trump, religion, bigotry...” and ‘Live Like Animals’ is an anthem for the disillusioned youth. It features lyrics such as “We put our lives all up for sale / We get our truth in the daily mail” and “We’re gonna make ’em build a wall / We’re gonna live like animals”. Other tracks, such as ‘Broken Machine’ itself, and the deluxe version’s ‘Number 13’ are more experimental rhythmically: they’re the type of songs you have to listen to a few times before you decide whether you like them or not. I did, and I do.\"
<ref>https://www.varsity.co.uk/music/13464</ref>.

In June 2016 they announced further tour dates in November and December 2016 in Birmingham, Manchester and London climaxing at the 5,000 capacity Brixton Academy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.livenation.co.uk/artist/nothing-but-thieves-tickets|title=Nothing But Thieves|website=Live Nation UK|access-date=13 June 2016}}</ref>.As of May 4, 2017, the album has sold over 250,000 copies, and accumulated 174 million track streams.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/nothing-thieves-new-single-amsterdam-tour-plans-matt-bellamys-advice-2066041#PFEO8gpa0zubmlMD.99|title=Nothing But Thieves on new single 'Amsterdam', tour plans and taking advice from Muse's Matt Bellamy – NME|date=2017-05-04|work=NME|access-date=2017-05-24}}</ref>

=== 2017–2019: ''Broken Machine'' and ''What Did You Think When You Made Me This Way?'' ===
A small tour of UK clubs took place in late May 2017, to support \"Amsterdam,\" the first single from their second album ''[[Broken Machine (album)|Broken Machine]]'', released on 8 September 2017. On 5 August 2017 they played to a crowd of over 500,000 people at [[Woodstock Festival (Poland)|Woodstock Festival Poland]]. On 23 August 2017 they supported Muse and [[Biffy Clyro]] at [[Belfast Vital|Vital Festival]] in [[Belfast]]. Their UK 2017 tour was completely sold out. The band has also managed to sell out two consecutive nights at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] in London. Sarah Taylor said on Varsity \"In general, this album pushes more boundaries than the last one. The band carved a name for themselves with their debut, but here it feels like they’re trying to define themselves to a further extent; there’s more variety in the music and lyricism, and more politics, too. Joe Langridge-Brown, guitarist and lyricist alongside Mason, said that “all the songs on the album are things that we’ve gone through or spoken about: Trump, religion, bigotry...” and ‘Live Like Animals’ is an anthem for the disillusioned youth. It features lyrics such as “We put our lives all up for sale / We get our truth in the daily mail” and “We’re gonna make ’em build a wall / We’re gonna live like animals”. Other tracks, such as ‘Broken Machine’ itself, and the deluxe version’s ‘Number 13’ are more experimental rhythmically: they’re the type of songs you have to listen to a few times before you decide whether you like them or not. I did, and I do.\"

On 24 August 2018, the band debuted a new song live entitled \"Forever and Ever More\" at Reading Festival, which was released as the lead off single from their new EP, \"[[What Did You Think When You Made Me This Way?]]\" a few days later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/nothing-but-thieves/2018/little-johns-farm-reading-england-2be8c43e.html|title=Nothing But Thieves Reading 2018 Setlist|work=Setlist|accessdate=23 October 2018}}</ref> The EP was released on 19 October 2018 alongside the second single from, \"Take This Lonely Heart\", on the same day.

=== 2020: Upcoming third studio album ===
On 18 March 2020, the first single of an upcoming third studio album was released, named \"Is Everybody Going Crazy?\".

On 11 April 2020, the band denied accusations of sexual assault against numerous members. The band had also been previously accused of sexual assault in 2017.<ref>https://www.nme.com/news/music/nothing-but-thieves-re-address-accusations-of-sexual-assault-2644956</ref>

The [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic]] spread to a number of military ships, with the nature of such ships, including working with others in small enclosed areas and the lack of private quarters for the vast majority of crew, contributing to the rapid spread of the disease, even more so than on [[2020 coronavirus pandemic on cruise ships|cruise ships]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/after-discovering-a-sailor-with-coronavirus-the-us-navy-crowded-dozens-into-one-room |title=After Discovering a Sailor With Coronavirus, the U.S. Navy Crowded Dozens into One Room |work=Propublica.org |last=Faturechi |first=Robert |last2=Rose |first2=Megan |last3=Miller |first3=T.

Note that, due to the nature of [[operations security]], national militaries may have policies in place that prevent or restrict reporting of such cases, so although the cases listed below may have been widely reported in reliable sources, they may not be, and perhaps never will be, confirmed by official spokespeople of the respective militaries.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=8 April 2020|title=Pentagon orders installations to stop reporting coronavirus cases as military-linked infections eclipse 1,000|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/us/pentagon-orders-installations-to-stop-reporting-coronavirus-cases-as-military-linked-infections-eclipse-1-000-1.624244|website=Stars and Stripes |last=Dickstein |first=Corey}}</ref>

The [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic]] spread to a number of military ships, with the nature of such ships, including working with others in small enclosed areas and the lack of private quarters for the vast majority of crew, contributing to the rapid spread of the disease, even more so than on [[2020 coronavirus pandemic on cruise ships|cruise ships]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/after-discovering-a-sailor-with-coronavirus-the-us-navy-crowded-dozens-into-one-room |title=After Discovering a Sailor With Coronavirus, the U.S. Navy Crowded Dozens into One Room |work=Propublica.org |last=Faturechi |first=Robert |last2=Rose |first2=Megan |last3=Miller |first3=T.

Change in the field of [[Human sexual behavior|sexuality]] reveals not only a change of sexual attitudes and behaviors but also a series of related social changes via the process of [[social transformation]]. From the [[sociological]] perspective, there have been several main factors that have created the current turning point in the contemporary Chinese social context.

==Contemporary history==
Since the early 1980s sex and sexuality have become prominent themes of public debate in China, after three decades during which discourses on sexuality were subject to stringent ideological controls.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elaine|last2=Yu|first2=Haiqing|title=Sex in China|date=2015|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=978-0-7456-5613-7|edition=1|url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745656137}}</ref>

===Market reform and opening-up policy===
The denial of the ideals of the [[Cultural Revolution]], during which sex was used as a political tool to control people, is an influential factor in making changes in Chinese society.<ref name=\"A people's sexual revolution in China\"/> During the Cultural Revolution, individual sexual preferences were supposed to give way to lofty revolutionary ideals. Extramarital affairs were portrayed as a degenerate lifestyle, and consensual pre-marital sex was immoral. [[Homosexuality]] was illegal and would be punished under the statutes for [[hooliganism]]. A person had to be sexually well-behaved in order to get a promotion or advance in his or her [[career]].<ref name=\"IESC Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#6 Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref>

Reforms in the area of sexuality show a lessening amount of government control over individuals' private life. Many sex-related issues and personal lifestyles are no longer relegated to the field of [[politics]] and thus exempt from severe legal punishment or moral condemnation. Sex has been returned to the personal sphere under the domain of self-management. These changes can be seen in the weakened interference and control of the government in sex-related areas, strengthened sexual resources in the open market, a diversity of sexual lifestyles, and a strong appeal for sexual rights as human rights.

For instance, the government's control of personal lives has gradually retreated since the passing of the new marriage registration principles in October 2003, which again simplified the processes of [[marriage]] and [[divorce]]. The committed parties no longer need certification or confirmation from their place of work or the local Resident Committee to get married or divorced. The pre-marital physical, which among other things once contained an indication of the woman's [[virginity]], is no longer obligatory. The new principles reflect a greater respect for human rights, a protection of marital freedom, and a change in the governmental function with regards to sexual issues.

At the same time, some major social policies have also played an important part. For example, the side effect of the family planning policy is to promote a separation of sexual behavior from [[reproduction|reproductive]] purposes. If a couple can give birth to one child only, sexual behavior is no longer solely practiced to produce babies but also for pleasure. Changes in the legal code have reflected this while also publicly acknowledging sex as a pursuit of happiness.

===Stable economic development and consumerism===
{{More citations needed|date=May 2009}}

Under recent policies, the social economy has seen stable and sustainable growth, especially in big cities. Material wealth and an increase in [[quality of life]] have brought [[optimism]] and [[consumerism]] which continually send messages to the individual that it is acceptable to seek sexual happiness.<ref name=\"A people's sexual revolution in China\"/>

Various [[sex products]] are now openly sold in the market. Sexual information is spreading directly or indirectly through such public media as street-side [[advertising]]. Fewer people turn away when they see intimate behavior between lovers in public. [[Condom]] [[vending machines]] are seen on [[campuses]]. Products for [[safe sex]] are available in [[convenience stores]] around city. Even major [[radio]] and [[television]] stations have started picking up on sex-related topics. Educational programs on sex have become popular. [[Video shop]]s, big or small, sell sexually oriented films produced either by domestic or foreign directors. More sexual information can also be quickly and easily found on the [[Internet]]. Intermingled information, good or bad, has pushed aside many of the traditional [[sexual taboo]]s and thus shaken the norm of sexual practice.

The pursuit of [[profit (economics)|profit]] may well push sexual minorities such as [[gay]]s and [[lesbians]] to appeal for their rights not just for legal reasons but also to tap into their particular market niches.<ref name=\"IESC Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors\"/> In a stable, developing economy and consumer culture, an emphasis on individual enjoyment and a respect for differentiation and diversity are now well established and perhaps even flourishing in an atmosphere of confidence and optimism.

===Growth of the middle class===
One very important factor driving the social change in contemporary China is the great changes in and reorganization of social stratification. One of the most important features is [[white collar workers]] — the rise of the new [[middle class]] in China. The new middle class tends to stress their personal happiness and pay more attention to their own quality of life.

Based on observations, all the visible changes in sexual discourse — including those in [[gay culture]] — can be considered a part of middle class culture. Most of the related website owners and participants belong to the white collar workers group. The new lifestyle in sexuality fields such as the [[DINKY|DINK]] — \"double income, no kids\"—family, single groups, and cohabitating couples who violate the traditional sex norms are led by middle-class people. They are also the target groups for most gay bars, dating parties, so-called \"dating on Saturday\" programs, and sports groups, among others, in [[Chinese cities]].

The rise and growth of this middle class has the potential to produce various sexual [[emancipation]] discourses, including homosexuality, to break the silence in Chinese society.

===Globalization===
Since China adopted the policies of opening up and market reform, globalization has meant that there have been many people traveling across countries and from one region to another in China. It means information sharing, product sharing, capital flow, and value sharing, which increasingly includes some basic understanding of sexual rights, [[gender equality]], and [[human rights]]. The country's various projects on sexuality, [[reproductive health]], and [[AIDS prevention]] each have raised people's awareness of sexuality. Some non-profit international or national organizations are also working in China, while at the same time the international academic community, together with Chinese scholars, is sponsoring workshops and conferences for research on sexuality.<ref>Elain Jeffreys (1997) ''Sex and Sexuality in China''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-40143-7}}</ref>

==Popularization of higher education==
{{See also|National College Entrance Examination}}

Popularization of [[higher education]] has become one of the major changes in [[Education in China|Chinese education]].<ref name=\"IESC Research and Advanced Education\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#13 Research and Advanced Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref> According to recent statistics publicized by the [[Shanghai]] Education Commission, the gross entrance rate into higher education in Shanghai is 55 percent, ranking first in the country. [[Beijing]] comes a close second, at 53 percent. In the same year, the nation's gross entrance rate into higher education has not yet reached 19 percent. More than half of the population aged 18 to 22 in Shanghai and Beijing can get access to some form of higher education.

The impact of higher education has been significant. The younger generation may adopt a different sexual ideology from the older generation because they have more opportunities to get exposure to humanities and [[social sciences]].<ref name=\"IESC Research and Advanced Education\"/> They are more geared toward the pursuit of equality, freedom, and self-realization. At the same time, society pays more and more attention to elite [[intellectuals]] such as professors, researchers, lawyers, and policy-making consultants. Their opinions and ideas are expressed to the public in media reports and at conferences. The spreading of knowledge has been the most influential way to eliminate sex discrimination and sex inequality.<ref name=\"IESC Research and Advanced Education\"/>

==Feminist discourse in China==
[[Gender equality]] has been one of China's national policies. The [[Cultural Revolution]] slogan \"Women can hold up half the sky\" is well known. Many organizations and centers for gender were established after the Fourth UN Conference on Women was held in Beijing in 1995.<ref>[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/index.html Fourth World Conference on Women], Beijing, China - September 1995, Action for Equality, Development and Peace.</ref> The government sponsored the conference and then signed the UN documents pledging gender equality, and official women's organizations and feminist activists and scholars have been fighting against gender discrimination and working on achieving gender equality. Their struggle has permeated many aspects of the people's social lives.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#1 Basic Sexological Premises] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref>

Mainstream [[feminist]] discourse in China tends to ignore sexuality issues, considering those topics either unimportant or as stirring up unnecessary trouble. Nevertheless, the critical thinking of feminist discourse has challenged stereotyped gender roles, including sexuality roles. The latter especially has influenced many young people.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\"/>

The role of feminist discourse in the field of sexuality has been to redefine a woman's sex role. It criticized the double standards of sex between women and men, which included traditionally held norms such as that men should be aggressive and active, women passive and inactive; that men should have stronger sexual desires and women weaker; that men should be sexually experienced before marriage but women retain their virginity; that women should not ask too much for sex and should consider men's satisfaction as their own. The critical feminist discourse is also rewriting the gender views in Chinese society. Some feminist scholars have started to emphasize women's sexual rights and the diversity of sexuality among Chinese women. Thus China's sexual revolution is also women's sexual revolution, as evidenced by these trends.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\"/>

While women in previous generations were expected to marry in their twenties, many highly educated women are deciding to hold off on marriage into their 30s or longer. Their increased economic power has given them autonomy so they don't need to rely on a spouse. But the Chinese media has still given them a derogatory name, ''shengnu'' (剩女) or \"leftover women\".<ref>{{cite web|title=China's Successful Ladies See Shrinking Pool of Mr. Right|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/china-women-marriage-education-employment|publisher=Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting|accessdate=28 December 2017}}</ref>

In 2005, China added new provisions to the ''Law on Women's Right Protection'' to include sexual harassment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4625913.stm |title=China to outlaw sexual harassment |publisher=BBC News |date=27 June 2005 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref>  In 2006 \"The Shanghai Supplement\" was drafted to help further define sexual harassment in China.<ref>{{cite news|last=Li |first=Cao |last2=South |first2=Mark |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-10/27/content_718147.htm |title=Draft bill details sexual harassment |publisher=China Daily |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref>

==Role of the media and the Internet==
The [[Media of China|media]] is the catalytic agent of sexual revolution in China. The [[Internet in China|Internet]], too, is one of the most prominent agents wielding important influence among the Chinese people through promoting alliances, sharing knowledge, and providing a platform where various voices can be heard. There are numerous individuals who come to accept their sexual identity mainly because of the Internet. The Internet is a powerful channel for people to find sexual partners, to organize off-line activities, or just simply to have access to sexual knowledge and sex-related information.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elaine|last2=Yu|first2=Haiqing|title=Sex in China|date=2015|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=9780745656137|pages=69–95|url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745656137}}</ref>

The Internet has also been a great proponent of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) identity in China. Since the late 1990s, members of the LGBT community have used the Internet to access and share information, form relationships, and cultivate queer identities and communities. However, despite the seemingly unconstrained development of the LGBT community in the global cyberspace, there are constraints. Some constraints are informed by socio-economic factors. There are some gay, lesbian and queer people who cannot afford a computer and access to the Internet at home and therefore are obliged to use Internet cafes, where they may be compelled to avoid certain websites for fear of being monitored by other people. Some constraints are politically informed. Gay and lesbian-oriented websites tend to be short-lived due to Internet regulations and controls of the government. Furthermore, despite an online proliferation of the LGBT identity, the community remains subordinate to China's hegemonic discourse on sexuality. Rarely do traditional Chinese media outlets recognise LGBT identity, let alone embrace and validate the community.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elaine|last2=Yu|first2=Haiqing|title=Sex in China|date=2015|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=9780745656137|pages=69–95|edition=1st|url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745656137}}</ref>

==Sexual revolution==
In [[Putonghua|Chinese language]], ''xingkaifang'' ({{linktext|性|开|放}}) is the phrase to describe the sexual opening-up,<ref name=\"James Farrer\">James Farrer (2002) ''Opening Up: Youth sex culture and market reform in Shanghai'' page 24. {{ISBN|0-226-23871-7}}</ref> \"a [[globalization|globalizing]] sexual culture prevailing China.\"<ref name=\"James Farrer\" />
[[Urbanization]] in China has been accelerating the sexual revolution by providing people with more private space and freedom to enjoy sex, as compared with what was afforded by the traditional countryside way of life. The [[Internet]] provides even more powerful support and makes it possible for many people to remain [[Anonymity|anonymous]], to surf the Internet from one website to another, to write their own [[blogs]], and to express what they want in an environment where there is much less prying by co-workers, neighbors, or other peer groups and less judgments put upon their behavior.
However, [[Internet censorship in China]] does remain an issue. Chinese government has successfully blocked activists from participating political discourse on the internet.<ref>MacKinnon Rebecca. \"Flatter world and thicker walls? Blogs, censorship and civic discourse in China\". University of Hong Kong, 2007, p.1.</ref>

==Government interventions==
===The \"Group Licentiousness\" law===
The [[PRC Government]] still regulates sexuality to a greater degree than the governments of [[Western countries]]. Recently, [[Ma Xiaohai]], a 53-year-old [[computer science]] professor,<ref name=\"Jailed professor\">{{cite news

===Against the Love Land theme park in Chongqing===
The proposed [[Love Land (China)|Love Land]] sex theme park in [[Chongqing]], southwest [[China]], was never opened due to government pressure. The [[PRC Government]] suspended its construction in May 2009 and ordered it demolished for being vulgar and explicit.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.chinahush.com/2009/05/17/chongqing-sex-park-love-land-dismantled-for-being-vulgar-and-explicit/ | title=Chongqing \"Sex Park\" (Love Land) Dismantled for being Vulgar and Explicit |website=Chinahush.com | date=17 May 2009 | accessdate=22 September 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/18/china-love-land-sex-theme_n_204586.html | title=China Love Land: Sex Theme Park Demolished Before Debut | newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=18 June 2009 }}</ref> The park was to include displays of giant [[genitalia]] and naked bodies, and host an exhibition on the [[history of human sexuality]] along with sex technique workshops.<ref name=\"BBC09\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8053596.stm|title=China builds first sex theme park|date=May 16, 2009|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-05-17}}</ref> The closure is a reflection of the conservatism with regard to sex in China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/china-and-its-neighbors/090519/china-sex-park-long-way-disneyworld |first=Kathleen E. |last=McLaughlin |title=China sex park: \"Love Land\" is no Disneyland |publisher=[[GlobalPost]] |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=22 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211043601/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/china-and-its-neighbors/090519/china-sex-park-long-way-disneyworld |archivedate=11 December 2015 }}</ref> The theme park was originally due to be opened in October 2009, but was demolished earlier that year, since it was deemed to be a negative influence on [[Chinese society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/lifestylenews/view/430040/1/.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119111650/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/lifestylenews/view/430040/1/.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 19, 2013|title=China builds first sex theme park|date=May 18, 2009|publisher=[[ChannelNewsAsia]]|accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,520501,00.html | work=[[Fox News]] | title=Chinese Sex Theme Park Knocked Down After Photos Released | date=2009-05-18}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/world/asia/19china.html?_r=1&ref=global-home|title=Chinese City Is Chilly to a Sex Theme Park |last=Wong|first=Edward|date=2009-05-18|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref>

==AIDS and sexuality==
The importance of [[AIDS prevention in China]] has been stressed by both the global society and the Chinese government.<ref name=\"IESC HIV/AIDS\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#11 HIV/AIDS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref> Such an increase in concern can be a double-edged sword for the sexual revolution in China. It provides both opportunities and risks. Sexuality has to be openly discussed because of AIDS concerns. For example, in the summer of 2005, [[China Central Television]] discussed the topic of AIDS under the title \"Homosexuality: Confronting is Better than Evading.\" Scholars and activists have gained the legitimacy to talk publicly about the so-called \"high risk\" groups such as gay men and sex workers and have been developing strategies to work together with the government, replacing strategies of attacking the \"evil\" with models for caring for those at risk.<ref name=\"IESC HIV/AIDS\"/>

Sexuality, including homosexuality, has started to enter the public forum. The whole process is still ongoing, but it is breaking the silence on sexuality taboos. AIDS concerns also bring funding, and many organizations are working to fight the illness. The related knowledge and information on sexuality is spreading continuously among Chinese people, and it also strongly helps people to overcome the [[stereotypes]], [[bias]] and [[ignorance]] regarding AIDS and sexual health issues.<ref name=\"IESC HIV/AIDS\"/>

At the same time, some major social policies have also played an important part. For example, the side effect of the family planning policy is to promote a separation of sexual behavior from [[reproduction|reproductive]] purposes. If a couple can give birth to one child only, sexual behavior is no longer solely practiced to produce babies but also for pleasure. Changes in the legal code have reflected this while also publicly acknowledging sex as a pursuit of happiness.

===Stable economic development and consumerism===
{{More citations needed|date=May 2009}}

Under recent policies, the social economy has seen stable and sustainable growth, especially in big cities. Material wealth and an increase in [[quality of life]] have brought [[optimism]] and [[consumerism]] which continually send messages to the individual that it is acceptable to seek sexual happiness.<ref name=\"A people's sexual revolution in China\"/>

Various [[sex products]] are now openly sold in the market. Sexual information is spreading directly or indirectly through such public media as street-side [[advertising]]. Fewer people turn away when they see intimate behavior between lovers in public. [[Condom]] [[vending machines]] are seen on [[campuses]]. Products for [[safe sex]] are available in [[convenience stores]] around city. Even major [[radio]] and [[television]] stations have started picking up on sex-related topics. Educational programs on sex have become popular. [[Video shop]]s, big or small, sell sexually oriented films produced either by domestic or foreign directors. More sexual information can also be quickly and easily found on the [[Internet]]. Intermingled information, good or bad, has pushed aside many of the traditional [[sexual taboo]]s and thus shaken the norm of sexual practice.

The pursuit of [[profit (economics)|profit]] may well push sexual minorities such as [[gay]]s and [[lesbians]] to appeal for their rights not just for legal reasons but also to tap into their particular market niches.<ref name=\"IESC Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors\"/> In a stable, developing economy and consumer culture, an emphasis on individual enjoyment and a respect for differentiation and diversity are now well established and perhaps even flourishing in an atmosphere of confidence and optimism.

===Growth of the middle class===
One very important factor driving the social change in contemporary China is the great changes in and reorganization of social stratification. One of the most important features is [[white collar workers]] — the rise of the new [[middle class]] in China. The new middle class tends to stress their personal happiness and pay more attention to their own quality of life.

Based on observations, all the visible changes in sexual discourse — including those in [[gay culture]] — can be considered a part of middle class culture. Most of the related website owners and participants belong to the white collar workers group. The new lifestyle in sexuality fields such as the [[DINKY|DINK]] — \"double income, no kids\"—family, single groups, and cohabitating couples who violate the traditional sex norms are led by middle-class people. They are also the target groups for most gay bars, dating parties, so-called \"dating on Saturday\" programs, and sports groups, among others, in [[Chinese cities]].

The rise and growth of this middle class has the potential to produce various sexual [[emancipation]] discourses, including homosexuality, to break the silence in Chinese society.

===Globalization===
Since China adopted the policies of opening up and market reform, globalization has meant that there have been many people traveling across countries and from one region to another in China. It means information sharing, product sharing, capital flow, and value sharing, which increasingly includes some basic understanding of sexual rights, [[gender equality]], and [[human rights]]. The country's various projects on sexuality, [[reproductive health]], and [[AIDS prevention]] each have raised people's awareness of sexuality. Some non-profit international or national organizations are also working in China, while at the same time the international academic community, together with Chinese scholars, is sponsoring workshops and conferences for research on sexuality.<ref>Elain Jeffreys (1997) ''Sex and Sexuality in China''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-40143-7}}</ref>

==Popularization of higher education==
{{See also|National College Entrance Examination}}

Popularization of [[higher education]] has become one of the major changes in [[Education in China|Chinese education]].<ref name=\"IESC Research and Advanced Education\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#13 Research and Advanced Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref> According to recent statistics publicized by the [[Shanghai]] Education Commission, the gross entrance rate into higher education in Shanghai is 55 percent, ranking first in the country. [[Beijing]] comes a close second, at 53 percent. In the same year, the nation's gross entrance rate into higher education has not yet reached 19 percent. More than half of the population aged 18 to 22 in Shanghai and Beijing can get access to some form of higher education.

The impact of higher education has been significant. The younger generation may adopt a different sexual ideology from the older generation because they have more opportunities to get exposure to humanities and [[social sciences]].<ref name=\"IESC Research and Advanced Education\"/> They are more geared toward the pursuit of equality, freedom, and self-realization. At the same time, society pays more and more attention to elite [[intellectuals]] such as professors, researchers, lawyers, and policy-making consultants. Their opinions and ideas are expressed to the public in media reports and at conferences. The spreading of knowledge has been the most influential way to eliminate sex discrimination and sex inequality.<ref name=\"IESC Research and Advanced Education\"/>

==Feminist discourse in China==
[[Gender equality]] has been one of China's national policies. The [[Cultural Revolution]] slogan \"Women can hold up half the sky\" is well known. Many organizations and centers for gender were established after the Fourth UN Conference on Women was held in Beijing in 1995.<ref>[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/index.html Fourth World Conference on Women], Beijing, China - September 1995, Action for Equality, Development and Peace.</ref> The government sponsored the conference and then signed the UN documents pledging gender equality, and official women's organizations and feminist activists and scholars have been fighting against gender discrimination and working on achieving gender equality. Their struggle has permeated many aspects of the people's social lives.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#1 Basic Sexological Premises] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref>

Mainstream [[feminist]] discourse in China tends to ignore sexuality issues, considering those topics either unimportant or as stirring up unnecessary trouble. Nevertheless, the critical thinking of feminist discourse has challenged stereotyped gender roles, including sexuality roles. The latter especially has influenced many young people.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\"/>

The role of feminist discourse in the field of sexuality has been to redefine a woman's sex role. It criticized the double standards of sex between women and men, which included traditionally held norms such as that men should be aggressive and active, women passive and inactive; that men should have stronger sexual desires and women weaker; that men should be sexually experienced before marriage but women retain their virginity; that women should not ask too much for sex and should consider men's satisfaction as their own. The critical feminist discourse is also rewriting the gender views in Chinese society. Some feminist scholars have started to emphasize women's sexual rights and the diversity of sexuality among Chinese women. Thus China's sexual revolution is also women's sexual revolution, as evidenced by these trends.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\"/>

While women in previous generations were expected to marry in their twenties, many highly educated women are deciding to hold off on marriage into their 30s or longer. Their increased economic power has given them autonomy so they don't need to rely on a spouse. But the Chinese media has still given them a derogatory name, ''shengnv'' (剩女) or \"leftover women\".<ref>{{cite web|title=China's Successful Ladies See Shrinking Pool of Mr. Right|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/china-women-marriage-education-employment|publisher=Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting|accessdate=28 December 2017}}</ref>

In 2005, China added new provisions to the ''Law on Women's Right Protection'' to include sexual harassment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4625913.stm |title=China to outlaw sexual harassment |publisher=BBC News |date=27 June 2005 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref>  In 2006 \"The Shanghai Supplement\" was drafted to help further define sexual harassment in China.<ref>{{cite news|last=Li |first=Cao |last2=South |first2=Mark |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-10/27/content_718147.htm |title=Draft bill details sexual harassment |publisher=China Daily |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref>

==Role of the media and the Internet==
The [[Media of China|media]] is the catalytic agent of sexual revolution in China. The [[Internet in China|Internet]], too, is one of the most prominent agents wielding important influence among the Chinese people through promoting alliances, sharing knowledge, and providing a platform where various voices can be heard. There are numerous individuals who come to accept their sexual identity mainly because of the Internet. The Internet is a powerful channel for people to find sexual partners, to organize off-line activities, or just simply to have access to sexual knowledge and sex-related information.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elaine|last2=Yu|first2=Haiqing|title=Sex in China|date=2015|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=9780745656137|pages=69–95|url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745656137}}</ref>

The Internet has also been a great proponent of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) identity in China. Since the late 1990s, members of the LGBT community have used the Internet to access and share information, form relationships, and cultivate queer identities and communities. However, despite the seemingly unconstrained development of the LGBT community in the global cyberspace, there are constraints. Some constraints are informed by socio-economic factors. There are some gay, lesbian and queer people who cannot afford a computer and access to the Internet at home and therefore are obliged to use Internet cafes, where they may be compelled to avoid certain websites for fear of being monitored by other people. Some constraints are politically informed. Gay and lesbian-oriented websites tend to be short-lived due to Internet regulations and controls of the government. Furthermore, despite an online proliferation of the LGBT identity, the community remains subordinate to China's hegemonic discourse on sexuality. Rarely do traditional Chinese media outlets recognise LGBT identity, let alone embrace and validate the community.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elaine|last2=Yu|first2=Haiqing|title=Sex in China|date=2015|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=9780745656137|pages=69–95|edition=1st|url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745656137}}</ref>

==Sexual revolution==
In [[Putonghua|Chinese language]], ''xingkaifang'' ({{linktext|性|开|放}}) is the phrase to describe the sexual opening-up,<ref name=\"James Farrer\">James Farrer (2002) ''Opening Up: Youth sex culture and market reform in Shanghai'' page 24. {{ISBN|0-226-23871-7}}</ref> \"a [[globalization|globalizing]] sexual culture prevailing China.\"<ref name=\"James Farrer\" />
[[Urbanization]] in China has been accelerating the sexual revolution by providing people with more private space and freedom to enjoy sex, as compared with what was afforded by the traditional countryside way of life. The [[Internet]] provides even more powerful support and makes it possible for many people to remain [[Anonymity|anonymous]], to surf the Internet from one website to another, to write their own [[blogs]], and to express what they want in an environment where there is much less prying by co-workers, neighbors, or other peer groups and less judgments put upon their behavior.
However, [[Internet censorship in China]] does remain an issue. Chinese government has successfully blocked activists from participating political discourse on the internet.<ref>MacKinnon Rebecca. \"Flatter world and thicker walls? Blogs, censorship and civic discourse in China\". University of Hong Kong, 2007, p.1.</ref>

==Government interventions==
===The \"Group Licentiousness\" law===
The [[PRC Government]] still regulates sexuality to a greater degree than the governments of [[Western countries]]. Recently, [[Ma Xiaohai]], a 53-year-old [[computer science]] professor,<ref name=\"Jailed professor\">{{cite news

===Against the Love Land theme park in Chongqing===
The proposed [[Love Land (China)|Love Land]] sex theme park in [[Chongqing]], southwest [[China]], was never opened due to government pressure. The [[PRC Government]] suspended its construction in May 2009 and ordered it demolished for being vulgar and explicit.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.chinahush.com/2009/05/17/chongqing-sex-park-love-land-dismantled-for-being-vulgar-and-explicit/ | title=Chongqing \"Sex Park\" (Love Land) Dismantled for being Vulgar and Explicit |website=Chinahush.com | date=17 May 2009 | accessdate=22 September 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/18/china-love-land-sex-theme_n_204586.html | title=China Love Land: Sex Theme Park Demolished Before Debut | newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=18 June 2009 }}</ref> The park was to include displays of giant [[genitalia]] and naked bodies, and host an exhibition on the [[history of human sexuality]] along with sex technique workshops.<ref name=\"BBC09\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8053596.stm|title=China builds first sex theme park|date=May 16, 2009|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-05-17}}</ref> The closure is a reflection of the conservatism with regard to sex in China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/china-and-its-neighbors/090519/china-sex-park-long-way-disneyworld |first=Kathleen E. |last=McLaughlin |title=China sex park: \"Love Land\" is no Disneyland |publisher=[[GlobalPost]] |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=22 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211043601/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/china-and-its-neighbors/090519/china-sex-park-long-way-disneyworld |archivedate=11 December 2015 }}</ref> The theme park was originally due to be opened in October 2009, but was demolished earlier that year, since it was deemed to be a negative influence on [[Chinese society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/lifestylenews/view/430040/1/.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119111650/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/lifestylenews/view/430040/1/.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 19, 2013|title=China builds first sex theme park|date=May 18, 2009|publisher=[[ChannelNewsAsia]]|accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,520501,00.html | work=[[Fox News]] | title=Chinese Sex Theme Park Knocked Down After Photos Released | date=2009-05-18}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/world/asia/19china.html?_r=1&ref=global-home|title=Chinese City Is Chilly to a Sex Theme Park |last=Wong|first=Edward|date=2009-05-18|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref>

==AIDS and sexuality==
The importance of [[AIDS prevention in China]] has been stressed by both the global society and the Chinese government.<ref name=\"IESC HIV/AIDS\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#11 HIV/AIDS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref> Such an increase in concern can be a double-edged sword for the sexual revolution in China. It provides both opportunities and risks. Sexuality has to be openly discussed because of AIDS concerns. For example, in the summer of 2005, [[China Central Television]] discussed the topic of AIDS under the title \"Homosexuality: Confronting is Better than Evading.\" Scholars and activists have gained the legitimacy to talk publicly about the so-called \"high risk\" groups such as gay men and sex workers and have been developing strategies to work together with the government, replacing strategies of attacking the \"evil\" with models for caring for those at risk.<ref name=\"IESC HIV/AIDS\"/>

Sexuality, including homosexuality, has started to enter the public forum. The whole process is still ongoing, but it is breaking the silence on sexuality taboos. AIDS concerns also bring funding, and many organizations are working to fight the illness. The related knowledge and information on sexuality is spreading continuously among Chinese people, and it also strongly helps people to overcome the [[stereotypes]], [[bias]] and [[ignorance]] regarding AIDS and sexual health issues.<ref name=\"IESC HIV/AIDS\"/>

{{Nihongo|'''Nakamichi Corp., Ltd.'''|株式会社中道|Kabushiki-Gaisha Nakamichi}} is a [[Japan|Japanese]] [[consumer electronics]] brand that originated in Japan and gained a name from the 1970s onwards for innovative and high quality audio [[cassette deck]]s. '''Nakamichi''' is a [[subsidiary]] of [[China|Chinese]] [[holding company]] [[Grande Holdings|Nimble Holdings]].<ref name=\"Nimble Holdings Annual Report 2017/18\"/>

Nakamichi manufactured electronic devices from its founding in 1948, but only sold them under its own name from 1972. It is credited with offering the world's first three-head cassette deck.<ref>{{cite web|last=Guttenberg|first=Steve|title=Nakamichi Dragon Cassette Deck|url=http://www.hometheater.com/content/nakamichi-dragon-cassette-deck|work=Home Theater magazine|publisher=Source Interlink Media|accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref> Since 1999, its product range has included design-oriented [[home cinema]] audio systems, sound bars, speakers, headphones, mini hi-fi systems, automotive stereo products and video DVD products.

==Background==
Nakamichi was founded by [[Etsuro Nakamichi]] in 1948 as Nakamichi Research Corporation Ltd (中道研究所株式会社 ''Nakamichi Kenkyujo Kabushiki Kaisha'') in [[Tokyo]], Japan. It specialised in manufacturing portable radios, tone arms, speakers, and communications equipment. It was later headed by the founder's younger brother Niro Nakamichi. The company was originally established as a research and development firm in electronics and optics but later became known as a manufacturer of quality audio products. While its cassette decks were particularly well known, the company is also credited with audio innovations, such as self-centering [[record player]]s, high-end [[Digital audio tape|DAT]] recorders, and ultra-compact slot-loading CD changers.

In the 1950s, Nakamichi developed one of the first [[open reel]] [[tape recorder]]s in Japan under the '''Magic Tone''' brand. In 1957, it developed and made its own magnetic tape heads, as well as launching the [[Fidela]] 3-head Open Reel Stereo Tape Deck.

Because of its experience in manufacturing magnetic tape heads and equipment, in 1967 the company started making tape decks for a number of foreign manufacturers including [[Harman Kardon]], [[KLH (company)|KLH]], [[Henry Kloss#Advent Corporation|Advent]], [[Fisher Electronics|Fisher]], [[ELAC, Inc.|ELAC]], [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]], [[Concord (audio)|Concord]], [[Ampex]] and [[Motorola]].

From 1973, Nakamichi started to sell high-quality stereo [[cassette deck]]s that benefited from the mass market's move away from [[reel-to-reel]] [[tape recorder]]s to the cassette format. The Nakamichi 1000 and 700, made in the mid-1970s, had three heads, a dual capstan drive that reduced [[wow (recording)|wow]] and [[flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]], and [[Dolby noise reduction system|Dolby-B noise reduction]] to improve the [[signal to noise ratio]]. The dual capstan drive ensured superior head-to-tape contact, essentially eliminating reliance on the problematic spring pressure pads built into cassette housings. (Later models were fitted with pressure pad lifters that further improved tape travel stability and reduced head wear.) High-end features of these models included adjustable [[record head]] [[azimuth]] and Dolby calibration. The relatively high retail price of the 1000 and 700 prompted Nakamichi to offer lower-priced two-head models, such as the Nakamichi 500 and the wedge-shaped 600.

[[Image:Nakamichi550.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Nakamichi 550. Portable, though the size and weight of an early VCR.]]

The Nakamichi 550 was a portable cassette recorder that had three [[microphone]] inputs: one for left channel, one for right channel, and one for a center blend channel. This recorder could run from batteries or AC and was used to make high quality recordings in the field.

In the late 1970s, Nakamichi updated and broadened its model range, with revised products including the Nakamichi 1000-II, the 700-II, and the lower-end 600-II. Nakamichi branched out into other audio components such as pre-amplifiers, power-amplifiers, tuners, receivers and later speakers.

In the early 1980s, Nakamichi's top-of-the-line cassette deck was the 1000ZXL, retailing at US$3,800, its price only exceeded by the 1000ZXL Limited at US$6,000. The updated 700ZXL sold for US$3,000, but Nakamichi also offered lower-end cassette decks under US$300. This time marked a peak in the market for cassette recorders, before it lost ground to [[digital recording]] media such as CD.

==The meaning of the brand name and logo==

{{expand section|date=December 2014}}
The Nakamichi logo consists, in part, of the stylized representation of the letter \"N\"; it is also intended to represent in a fanciful way the earth, half of which is illuminated by the sun.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

A translation of \"Nakamichi\", the family name of the company founder, is \"in the middle of a road\" or \"midway\".

==Notable Nakamichi products and advances==

===Three-head cassette decks===
Nakamichi was the first to use a three-head recording technique in a [[cassette deck]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Separate tape heads were used for playback, recording, and erase. Previously the playback and recording functions were combined in a single tape head.  The three-head mechanism allowed higher quality reproduction as well as the ability to hear a recording in progress - as the tape traveled past the recording head onto the playback head.

The first Nakamichi three-head decks were the 1000 and 700 introduced around 1973. The 1000 and 700 series decks had tape bias settings for normal bias (IEC TYPE I) and [[Tape bias|high bias]] (IEC TYPE II).  Competitor cassette decks offered Ferri Chrome (IEC TYPE III) whereas Nakamichi chose not to do so.  The settings for the normal and high bias were labeled as EX and SX respectively. Nakamichi also sold its own brand of blank cassette tapes.

Around 1978, when metal bias (IEC TYPE IV) cassettes came into the market, Nakamichi produced some early metal tape capable decks such as the 580M.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.vintagecassette.com/Nakamichi/580M | title= Nakamichi 580M | website= VintageCassette.com | accessdate= 24 April 2015}}</ref> The tape settings on these decks were EX (normal bias), SX (high bias), and ZX (metal bias).

Around 1980, Nakamichi introduced the third generation of 1000 and 700 three-head decks.  The 1000ZXL and 700ZXL had full metal capability as well as normal and high bias abilities and had built-in computers for calibrating the decks to a specific tape.  These built-in computers were known as A.B.L.E. for Azimuth, Bias, Level, and Equalization. The user would use this function (activated by an \"Auto Cal\" button) to optimize the deck to a specific brand of tape to get best recording results from every cassette.<ref>{{cite web

</ref>  
Hence the 1000ZXL and 700ZXL were known as computing cassette decks.  Also offered was a third less costly deck the 700ZXE auto tuning cassette deck.

A more expensive 1000ZXL Limited was also offered, with the same specifications as the 1000ZXL but with a gold plated face. Other Nakamichi cassette decks are the Cassette Deck 1 and the Cassette Deck 1 Limited. Like the 1000ZXL Limited, the Cassette Deck 1 Limited is more expensive than the Cassette Deck 1.

===Flip-Auto Reverse===
[[Image:Nakamichi RX 505 Front edited.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Nakamichi RX-505 audio cassette deck with UDAR.]]
[[Image:Nakamichi RX 505 Top Open1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Top view of UDAR mechanism.]]
Called \"UDAR\" for UniDirectional Auto Reverse.  Used on the Nakamichi RX series of decks.  With the advent of auto-reverse (playing the tape in both directions), Nakamichi had long recognized that the angle of the tape passing over the playback head was not the same if the tape head was rotated in the opposite direction and its first approach was to track the azimuth on the tape itself by moving the head slightly—a very complex affair which led to the design of the Dragon with its NAAC. Nakamichi subsequently abandoned this approach and set its engineers in search of a more elegant solution. Nakamichi soon developed its UDAR mechanism, which mimicked the way people had manually turned over their tapes in the past: a mechanical system that would eject the tape, spin it around and reload it into the deck.  It was available on all Nakamichi RX series of tape decks, i.e., the RX-202, RX-303 and RX-505. The 'top of the range' RX-505 was made after the Dragon. Its operation was elegantly simple, easy to set up, easy to calibrate, and easy to use, with only one rewind and forward operation in a unique unidirectional auto-reverse deck. It also had an updated and simpler drive system that was more direct loading, had updated and quieter electronics, and its revised capstan is essentially what Nakamichi used for its 1988 Nakamichi 1000 DAT recorder.

===Tape pressure pad lifter===
A [[Compact audio cassette|cassette tape]] contains a \"pressure pad\" of some type, usually made of felt ([[:image:Cassetteinternals.jpg|reference image]]).  This pad is within the cassette tape shell (located just behind the tape opening) and opposes the magnetic head of the [[cassette deck]], providing pressure against the head(s) when the tape is being played.  Nakamichi found that this pad provided uneven and fairly inaccurate pressure and was therefore inadequate for reliable tape/head contact. Furthermore, Nakamichi found that the pressure pad was a source of audible noise, particularly scrape flutter (the tape bouncing across the head, a result of uneven pressure), and also contributed to premature head wear. Nakamichi's dual-capstan tape decks provide such accurate and precise tape tension that, unlike other decks, the cassette's pressure pad is not needed at all. To remedy this problem, the vast majority of Nakamichi dual-capstan decks contain a \"cage\" around the record/playback heads that lifts the pressure pad out of the way so that the deck itself—specifically, the dual capstan mechanism—is able to maintain much more consistent tape tension and tape/head contact during playback.

===The Dragon and special products===
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Nakamichidragonct.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Nakamichi Dragon CT Turntable.]] -->
[[File:Nakamichi Dragon.jpg|thumb|Nakamichi Dragon]]

In the CD era (post 1983), the top line Nakamichi products were termed the \"Dragon.\"  The Dragon-CT turntable (\"Computing Turntable\") automatically adjusted for off-center holes in records by moving the platter in two dimensions.  The Dragon CD playing system has special mechanical damping to prevent vibrations of the CD, and holds multiple CDs.  The Dragon cassette deck used a special microprocessor controlled azimuth adjustment called Nakamichi Automatic Azimuth Correction (NAAC) to find the best sound for each recorded cassette tape, however because it was both expensive to manufacture and more complex as well as difficult to both service and maintain, Nakamichi sought to produce a new deck with the same excellent accuracy of azimuth but without the associated costs and difficulties of servicing. The solution (thought by some to be a gimmick) was to automate the manual turnover of tape; in other words eject the tape and flip it around to maintain proper tape head alignment. Nakamichi did this with its RX series. The RX-505 is not a compromise as many assumed but the very best method of maintaining azimuth without using the costly, complex and 'somewhat' fragile NAAC system even though the [[Akai]] GXC-65D was the first cassette deck to \"actually\" use this method where the cassette would flip over instead of the head being rotated but was done in a top-loading fashion as this were cassette decks from the early-mid 1970s.

Other products from Nakamichi did not acquire the \"Dragon\" name but were still notable. These include the Nakamichi 1000 series products with the 1000ZXL cassette deck being more advanced and expensive than the Dragon cassette deck. The Nakamichi 1000 digital audio tape transport and Nakamichi 1000p digital to audio converter system were Nakamichi's reference [[digital audio tape]] components. These components were intended to establish Nakamichi's dominance in the field of digital audio tape (DAT), but DAT was not widely adopted by [[audiophiles]], as the format itself did not gain acceptance as an [[Technical standard|industry standard]].

===Stasis Series amplifiers===
Nakamichi licensed \"Stasis\" technology from powerhouse amplifier manufacturer Threshold (a [[class-A amplifier]] circuit by Nelson Pass, then a designer at Threshold, now at [[Pass Labs]]). This circuit was used in a line of expensive Nakamichi PA series of power-amplifiers, such as the PA-5 and PA-7, as well as its SR and TA series of receivers.

===Car stereo products===
In the early 1980s, Nakamichi introduced a line of [[car stereo]] products.  The flagship product was the TD-1200 cassette receiver which incorporated a drawer-mounted, top-loading cassette mechanism with NAAC (like the Dragon), Dolby B and Dolby C.  Other early products included the TD-700 cassette receiver with manual azimuth adjustment (like the Cassette Deck 1, Cassette Deck 1 Limited, DR-1 and the CR-7), a power amplifier and speakers.  In the early 1990s, Nakamichi was one of the first companies to produce automotive CD changers that loaded multiple discs via a single slot rather than a CD cartridge.

[[Toyota]] would choose Nakamichi along with [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] to manufacture the audio systems for its range of [[Lexus]] automobiles. The Nakamichi unit was the flagship audio system offered to Lexus buyers, and this partnership lasted from 1989 to 2001.

Another follow-on flagship head unit was the TP-1200, which consisted of a headunit and a separate 'black box' pre-amp section. The casing for both units was made from machined aluminium, and the internal circuitry for both units was suspended using a mechanical  suspension system. The headunit contained a diversity tuner and display unit only. The pre-amp section performed input switching, volume and tone adjustment. The tone controls (bass-mid-treble) were motor driven analog controls while the volume, balance and fader were digital.

Other products of note were the 100pa amplifier and the limited edition version the 1000pa.
Both were identical in specifications (4x50wrms) and internal layout, the only difference being the case color.  The 100pa was silver and the 1000pa black. 
The mobile TD-560 was a versatile pull-out-of-dash and remote controlled cassette and FM tuner head unit, that performed at the level of excellence matched only by very best Nakamichi mobile decks of the late 1980s era.  
Revolutionary was Nakamichi's mobile PA-350 four channel power amplifier, with extraordinary discrete amplifiers and exemplary performance specifications.

In 1989 Nakamichi, along with Pioneer, teamed with Toyota Corp. to produce a premium sound system in its Lexus line of automobiles. In 1990, Nakamichi introduced the music bank in its CD players which was based on a single loading tray concept with a total capacity of 7 CDs. This differed from the rest of the industry which typically offered a self-loading magazine or a carousel. Nakamichi further enhanced the music bank system in its 1992 offering (MB line) touting the quickest changer in the market. However, the quick changer concept experienced frequent jamming in its machines and as a result, required the company to redesign the mechanism in 1994 with a slight delay during the loading process. While this was corrected, Nakamichi's footing in the digital age was not concrete. In fact, its presence in the rapidly growing audio/video arena was modest at best{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} with its Sansui sourced <ref>employed at Nakamichi in 1990-1991</ref> AV-1 and AV-2 receivers (introduced in 1991).  Further impacting its audio reputation was the ending of the licensing agreement with [[Nelson Pass]] for the use of the Stasis technology. Without it, its line of preamplifiers and power amplifiers were compromised; its technological advantage, more important in the high end audio market, was lost. Nakamichi attempted to counter the loss with its receivers touting Harmonic Time Alignment (HTA).{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

===Nakamichi Harmonic Time Alignment technology===

{{split|Harmonic Time Alignment|date=March 2019}}
The time alignment of an amplified music signal and its distortion components has a profound effect on perceived sound quality. Nakamichi researchers discovered that the human ear is much more tolerant of harmonic distortion if the distortion components are time-aligned with respect to the primary signal. Nakamichi Harmonic Time Alignment (HTA) amplifiers adopt a wideband, low open-loop gain design. A minimal amount of negative feedback is used, but, more important, it is kept constant over the entire audio spectrum. This assures the proper timing between the primary signal and any amplifier distortion components. The sonic benefits of this design include powerful, high-resolution bass, a natural, richly detailed midrange, and smooth, clear highs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- Tagging the whole paragraph -->

In layman's term, HTA masked distortion through the primary signal.  While effective, total harmonic distortion for this technology was higher than Nakamichi's receivers utilizing Stasis technology. Whether sound quality improved or dissipated with this technology is left to the listener's ears.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- Tagging the whole paragraph -->

==Decline of Nakamichi==
Nakamichi's reputation for being the pioneer of audio cassettes no longer carried weight in the era of CDs. The lack of innovative digital technology meant Nakamichi was unable to successfully brand itself in the digital age. Further adding to its demise was a shrinking distribution channel as high-end audio boutiques were forced to close as they could not compete in a rapidly changing environment where shoppers gravitated towards electronic superstores. Ultimately, electronic consumers, who once were able to apply a significant portion of their outlay on audio-only components, needed to allocate more of their budget towards acquiring new video gear such as [[LaserDisc|laser disc players]], flat panel displays, DVD players, etc. In addition, a recession in the early 1990s caused many consumers to settle for mainstream electronics brands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- Tagging the whole paragraph -->

Toyota also stopped using Nakamichi systems in Lexus vehicles at this time, instead choosing [[Mark Levinson Audio Systems|Mark Levinson]] when Toyota made a deal with [[Harman International]] to provide premium audio systems in its vehicles in 2000. Bob Carter, General Manager for Lexus, also cited a lack of \"resonance\" with intended consumers as reasons for the switch.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- Tagging the whole paragraph -->

By the end of 1990s, Nakamichi failed to transition properly. In 1998, it was acquired by Grande Holdings, a Chinese company based in Hong Kong. Grande Holdings included electronics companies [[Akai]] and [[Sansui Electric|Sansui]].  Niro Nakamichi left in 1998 to set up Mechanical Research Corporation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- Tagging the whole paragraph -->

== Nakamichi under Grande Holdings==
The company went into [[bankruptcy]] protection on February 19, 2002.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20020220/nakami.htm | title= Nakamichi, apply for Civil Rehabilitation Law - debt 20 billion yen, shipping and maintenance carried out as before | website= AV Watch | publisher= Impress Corp. | date= 19 February 2002 | accessdate= 24 April 2015| language= Japanese}}</ref> In Nakamichi's defense, many high end audio manufacturers were also forced to merge or sell to larger holding companies during this time period partially influenced by the collapse of the Japanese \"[[Japanese asset price bubble|bubble economy]]\"; such well known companies include McIntosh and Mark Levinson.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

The company emerged from bankruptcy and repositioned itself as a manufacturer of high-end \"lifestyle systems\" in the same manner as [[Bang & Olufsen]]. They also manufacture [[CD changer]]s for hi-fi, computer, and car audio units.

In June 2006, Nakamichi released its first portable [[DVD player]] with built-in [[LCD]] screen, the Lumos.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Nakamichi kimono LED hi-res image.pdf|thumb|Nakamichi Kimono 3D LED TV with slim full brushed aluminium body]]From 2011, Nakamichi offered a complete line of mass market audio products, including earbuds, headphones, speakers, wireless speakers and sound bars. Also to target a younger demographic, they manufactured iPod docking systems and 3D LED TVs.

In 2014, Nakamichi moved back to its high-end roots and presented a 7.1 Pre-/main Amplifier combination AV1/AVP1.<ref>[https://www.whathifi.com/nakamichi/av1avp1/review whathifi.com 15 May 2014, ''Nakamichi AV1/AVP1 review''] retrieved 13 2020-04-13.</ref>

In 2016, its focus shifted to soundbars by introducing its Shockwafe soundbar series. The first model, the Shockwafe Pro 7.1 soundbar, was the first soundbar to have 7 discrete surround channels. 

In 2018, Nakamichi added 4 more models into its Shockwafe lineup, incorporating dual-subwoofer and DTS:X technology into its design. During the 2018 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] held in Las Vegas, a series of blind listening battles were conducted for the public, including 2 exclusive sessions for members of the San Francisco Audiophile Society and private sessions to the media.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} Out of 204 people who participated, 81% voted Nakamichi Shockwafe Ultra 9.2 DTS:X Soundbar for best overall performance and 99% voted it for best overall value.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

In 2019, Nakamichi will be introducing 3 new soundbar models, integrated with Spatial Surround Elevation (SSE) processing technology, Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision and DTS:X. Nakamichi's Shockwafe Ultra 9.2 SSE Soundbar System was named a [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] 2019 Innovation Awards Honoree.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

==Niro Nakamichi==
In 2001, Niro Nakamichi, designer of many of the historic tape decks, started a new company, Mechanical Research Corporation, which introduced ultra high end audio amplifiers, preamplifiers, and an integrated amplifier, called \"engines.\" The products featured innovative designs and addressed issues of mechanical isolation, as well as presenting a unique appearance. Soon thereafter, however, the \"engine\" products were no longer promoted and a line of home theater products was introduced [http://www.niro1.com/en/].

{{Nihongo|'''Nakamichi Corp., Ltd.'''|株式会社中道|Kabushiki-Gaisha Nakamichi}} is a [[Japan|Japanese]] [[consumer electronics]] brand that originated in Japan and gained a name from the 1970s onwards for innovative and high quality audio [[cassette deck]]s. '''Nakamichi''' is a [[subsidiary]] of [[China|Chinese]] [[holding company]] [[Grande Holdings|Nimble Holdings]].<ref name=\"Nimble Holdings Annual Report 2017/18\"/>

Nakamichi manufactured electronic devices from its founding in 1948, but only sold them under its own name from 1972. It is credited with offering the world's first three-head cassette deck.<ref>{{cite web|last=Guttenberg|first=Steve|title=Nakamichi Dragon Cassette Deck|url=http://www.hometheater.com/content/nakamichi-dragon-cassette-deck|work=Home Theater magazine|publisher=Source Interlink Media|accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref> Since 1999, its product range has included design-oriented [[home cinema]] audio systems, sound bars, speakers, headphones, mini hi-fi systems, automotive stereo products and video DVD products.

==Background==
Nakamichi was founded by [[Etsuro Nakamichi]] in 1948 as Nakamichi Research Corporation Ltd (中道研究所株式会社 ''Nakamichi Kenkyujo Kabushiki Kaisha'') in [[Tokyo]], Japan. It specialised in manufacturing portable radios, tone arms, speakers, and communications equipment. It was later headed by the founder's younger brother Niro Nakamichi. The company was originally established as a research and development firm in electronics and optics but later became known as a manufacturer of quality audio products. While its cassette decks were particularly well known, the company is also credited with audio innovations, such as self-centering [[record player]]s, high-end [[Digital audio tape|DAT]] recorders, and ultra-compact slot-loading CD changers.

In the 1950s, Nakamichi developed one of the first [[open reel]] [[tape recorder]]s in Japan under the '''Magic Tone''' brand. In 1957, it developed and made its own magnetic tape heads, as well as launching the [[Fidela]] 3-head Open Reel Stereo Tape Deck.

Because of its experience in manufacturing magnetic tape heads and equipment, in 1967 the company started making tape decks for a number of foreign manufacturers including [[Harman Kardon]], [[KLH (company)|KLH]], [[Henry Kloss#Advent Corporation|Advent]], [[Fisher Electronics|Fisher]], [[ELAC, Inc.|ELAC]], [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]], [[Concord (audio)|Concord]], [[Ampex]] and [[Motorola]].

From 1973, Nakamichi started to sell high-quality stereo [[cassette deck]]s that benefited from the mass market's move away from [[reel-to-reel]] [[tape recorder]]s to the cassette format. The Nakamichi 1000 and 700, made in the mid-1970s, had three heads, a dual capstan drive that reduced [[wow (recording)|wow]] and [[flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]], and [[Dolby noise reduction system|Dolby-B noise reduction]] to improve the [[signal to noise ratio]]. The dual capstan drive ensured superior head-to-tape contact, essentially eliminating reliance on the problematic spring pressure pads built into cassette housings. (Later models were fitted with pressure pad lifters that further improved tape travel stability and reduced head wear.) High-end features of these models included adjustable [[record head]] [[azimuth]] and Dolby calibration. The relatively high retail price of the 1000 and 700 prompted Nakamichi to offer lower-priced two-head models, such as the Nakamichi 500 and the wedge-shaped 600.

[[Image:Nakamichi550.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Nakamichi 550. Portable, though the size and weight of an early VCR.]]

The Nakamichi 550 was a portable cassette recorder that had three [[microphone]] inputs: one for left channel, one for right channel, and one for a center blend channel. This recorder could run from batteries or AC and was used to make high quality recordings in the field.

In the late 1970s, Nakamichi updated and broadened its model range, with revised products including the Nakamichi 1000-II, the 700-II, and the lower-end 600-II. Nakamichi branched out into other audio components such as pre-amplifiers, power-amplifiers, tuners, receivers and later speakers.

In the early 1980s, Nakamichi's top-of-the-line cassette deck was the 1000ZXL, retailing at US$3,800, its price only exceeded by the 1000ZXL Limited at US$6,000. The updated 700ZXL sold for US$3,000, but Nakamichi also offered lower-end cassette decks under US$300. This time marked a peak in the market for cassette recorders, before it lost ground to [[digital recording]] media such as CD.

==The meaning of the brand name and logo==

{{expand section|date=December 2014}}
The Nakamichi logo consists, in part, of the stylized representation of the letter \"N\"; it is also intended to represent in a fanciful way the earth, half of which is illuminated by the sun.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

A translation of \"Nakamichi\", the family name of the company founder, is \"in the middle of a road\" or \"midway\".

==Notable Nakamichi products and advances==

===Three-head cassette decks===
Nakamichi was the first to use a three-head recording technique in a [[cassette deck]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Separate tape heads were used for playback, recording, and erase. Previously the playback and recording functions were combined in a single tape head.  The three-head mechanism allowed higher quality reproduction as well as the ability to hear a recording in progress - as the tape traveled past the recording head onto the playback head.

The first Nakamichi three-head decks were the 1000 and 700 introduced around 1973. The 1000 and 700 series decks had tape bias settings for normal bias (IEC TYPE I) and [[Tape bias|high bias]] (IEC TYPE II).  Competitor cassette decks offered Ferri Chrome (IEC TYPE III) whereas Nakamichi chose not to do so.  The settings for the normal and high bias were labeled as EX and SX respectively. Nakamichi also sold its own brand of blank cassette tapes.

Around 1978, when metal bias (IEC TYPE IV) cassettes came into the market, Nakamichi produced some early metal tape capable decks such as the 580M.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.vintagecassette.com/Nakamichi/580M | title= Nakamichi 580M | website= VintageCassette.com | accessdate= 24 April 2015}}</ref> The tape settings on these decks were EX (normal bias), SX (high bias), and ZX (metal bias).

Around 1980, Nakamichi introduced the third generation of 1000 and 700 three-head decks.  The 1000ZXL and 700ZXL had full metal capability as well as normal and high bias abilities and had built-in computers for calibrating the decks to a specific tape.  These built-in computers were known as A.B.L.E. for Azimuth, Bias, Level, and Equalization. The user would use this function (activated by an \"Auto Cal\" button) to optimize the deck to a specific brand of tape to get best recording results from every cassette.<ref>{{cite web

</ref>  
Hence the 1000ZXL and 700ZXL were known as computing cassette decks.  Also offered was a third less costly deck the 700ZXE auto tuning cassette deck.

A more expensive 1000ZXL Limited was also offered, with the same specifications as the 1000ZXL but with a gold plated face. Other Nakamichi cassette decks are the Cassette Deck 1 and the Cassette Deck 1 Limited. Like the 1000ZXL Limited, the Cassette Deck 1 Limited is more expensive than the Cassette Deck 1.

===Flip-Auto Reverse===
[[Image:Nakamichi RX 505 Front edited.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Nakamichi RX-505 audio cassette deck with UDAR.]]
[[Image:Nakamichi RX 505 Top Open1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Top view of UDAR mechanism.]]
Called \"UDAR\" for UniDirectional Auto Reverse.  Used on the Nakamichi RX series of decks.  With the advent of auto-reverse (playing the tape in both directions), Nakamichi had long recognized that the angle of the tape passing over the playback head was not the same if the tape head was rotated in the opposite direction and its first approach was to track the azimuth on the tape itself by moving the head slightly—a very complex affair which led to the design of the Dragon with its NAAC. Nakamichi subsequently abandoned this approach and set its engineers in search of a more elegant solution. Nakamichi soon developed its UDAR mechanism, which mimicked the way people had manually turned over their tapes in the past: a mechanical system that would eject the tape, spin it around and reload it into the deck.  It was available on all Nakamichi RX series of tape decks, i.e., the RX-202, RX-303 and RX-505. The 'top of the range' RX-505 was made after the Dragon. Its operation was elegantly simple, easy to set up, easy to calibrate, and easy to use, with only one rewind and forward operation in a unique unidirectional auto-reverse deck. It also had an updated and simpler drive system that was more direct loading, had updated and quieter electronics, and its revised capstan is essentially what Nakamichi used for its 1988 Nakamichi 1000 DAT recorder.

===Tape pressure pad lifter===
A [[Compact audio cassette|cassette tape]] contains a \"pressure pad\" of some type, usually made of felt ([[:image:Cassetteinternals.jpg|reference image]]).  This pad is within the cassette tape shell (located just behind the tape opening) and opposes the magnetic head of the [[cassette deck]], providing pressure against the head(s) when the tape is being played.  Nakamichi found that this pad provided uneven and fairly inaccurate pressure and was therefore inadequate for reliable tape/head contact. Furthermore, Nakamichi found that the pressure pad was a source of audible noise, particularly scrape flutter (the tape bouncing across the head, a result of uneven pressure), and also contributed to premature head wear. Nakamichi's dual-capstan tape decks provide such accurate and precise tape tension that, unlike other decks, the cassette's pressure pad is not needed at all. To remedy this problem, the vast majority of Nakamichi dual-capstan decks contain a \"cage\" around the record/playback heads that lifts the pressure pad out of the way so that the deck itself—specifically, the dual capstan mechanism—is able to maintain much more consistent tape tension and tape/head contact during playback.

===The Dragon and special products===

[[File:Nakamichi Dragon.jpg|thumb|Nakamichi Dragon]]

In the CD era (post 1983), the top line Nakamichi products were termed the \"Dragon.\"  The Dragon-CT turntable (\"Computing Turntable\") automatically adjusted for off-center holes in records by moving the platter in two dimensions.  The Dragon CD playing system has special mechanical damping to prevent vibrations of the CD, and holds multiple CDs.  The Dragon cassette deck used a special microprocessor controlled azimuth adjustment called Nakamichi Automatic Azimuth Correction (NAAC) to find the best sound for each recorded cassette tape, however because it was both expensive to manufacture and more complex as well as difficult to both service and maintain, Nakamichi sought to produce a new deck with the same excellent accuracy of azimuth but without the associated costs and difficulties of servicing. The solution (thought by some to be a gimmick) was to automate the manual turnover of tape; in other words eject the tape and flip it around to maintain proper tape head alignment. Nakamichi did this with its RX series. The RX-505 is not a compromise as many assumed but the very best method of maintaining azimuth without using the costly, complex and 'somewhat' fragile NAAC system even though the [[Akai]] GXC-65D was the first cassette deck to \"actually\" use this method where the cassette would flip over instead of the head being rotated but was done in a top-loading fashion as this were cassette decks from the early-mid 1970s.

Other products from Nakamichi did not acquire the \"Dragon\" name but were still notable. These include the Nakamichi 1000 series products with the 1000ZXL cassette deck being more advanced and expensive than the Dragon cassette deck. The Nakamichi 1000 digital audio tape transport and Nakamichi 1000p digital to audio converter system were Nakamichi's reference [[digital audio tape]] components. These components were intended to establish Nakamichi's dominance in the field of digital audio tape (DAT), but DAT was not widely adopted by [[audiophiles]], as the format itself did not gain acceptance as an [[Technical standard|industry standard]].

===Stasis Series amplifiers===
Nakamichi licensed \"Stasis\" technology from powerhouse amplifier manufacturer Threshold (a [[class-A amplifier]] circuit by Nelson Pass, then a designer at Threshold, now at [[Pass Labs]]). This circuit was used in a line of expensive Nakamichi PA series of power-amplifiers, such as the PA-5 and PA-7, as well as its SR and TA series of receivers.

===Car stereo products===
In the early 1980s, Nakamichi introduced a line of [[car stereo]] products.  The flagship product was the TD-1200 cassette receiver which incorporated a drawer-mounted, top-loading cassette mechanism with NAAC (like the Dragon), Dolby B and Dolby C.  Other early products included the TD-700 cassette receiver with manual azimuth adjustment (like the Cassette Deck 1, Cassette Deck 1 Limited, DR-1 and the CR-7), a power amplifier and speakers.  In the early 1990s, Nakamichi was one of the first companies to produce automotive CD changers that loaded multiple discs via a single slot rather than a CD cartridge.

[[Toyota]] would choose Nakamichi along with [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] to manufacture the audio systems for its range of [[Lexus]] automobiles. The Nakamichi unit was the flagship audio system offered to Lexus buyers, and this partnership lasted from 1989 to 2001.

Another follow-on flagship head unit was the TP-1200, which consisted of a headunit and a separate 'black box' pre-amp section. The casing for both units was made from machined aluminium, and the internal circuitry for both units was suspended using a mechanical  suspension system. The headunit contained a diversity tuner and display unit only. The pre-amp section performed input switching, volume and tone adjustment. The tone controls (bass-mid-treble) were motor driven analog controls while the volume, balance and fader were digital.

Other products of note were the 100pa amplifier and the limited edition version the 1000pa.
Both were identical in specifications (4x50wrms) and internal layout, the only difference being the case color.  The 100pa was silver and the 1000pa black. 
The mobile TD-560 was a versatile pull-out-of-dash and remote controlled cassette and FM tuner head unit, that performed at the level of excellence matched only by very best Nakamichi mobile decks of the late 1980s era.  
Revolutionary was Nakamichi's mobile PA-350 four channel power amplifier, with extraordinary discrete amplifiers and exemplary performance specifications.

In 1989 Nakamichi, along with Pioneer, teamed with Toyota Corp. to produce a premium sound system in its Lexus line of automobiles. In 1990, Nakamichi introduced the music bank in its CD players which was based on a single loading tray concept with a total capacity of 7 CDs. This differed from the rest of the industry which typically offered a self-loading magazine or a carousel. Nakamichi further enhanced the music bank system in its 1992 offering (MB line) touting the quickest changer in the market. However, the quick changer concept experienced frequent jamming in its machines and as a result, required the company to redesign the mechanism in 1994 with a slight delay during the loading process. While this was corrected, Nakamichi's footing in the digital age was not concrete. In fact, its presence in the rapidly growing audio/video arena was modest at best{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} with its Sansui sourced <ref>employed at Nakamichi in 1990-1991</ref> AV-1 and AV-2 receivers (introduced in 1991).  Further impacting its audio reputation was the ending of the licensing agreement with [[Nelson Pass]] for the use of the Stasis technology. Without it, its line of preamplifiers and power amplifiers were compromised; its technological advantage, more important in the high end audio market, was lost. Nakamichi attempted to counter the loss with its receivers touting Harmonic Time Alignment (HTA).{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

===Nakamichi Harmonic Time Alignment technology===

{{split|Harmonic Time Alignment|date=March 2019}}
The time alignment of an amplified music signal and its distortion components has a profound effect on perceived sound quality. Nakamichi researchers discovered that the human ear is much more tolerant of harmonic distortion if the distortion components are time-aligned with respect to the primary signal. Nakamichi Harmonic Time Alignment (HTA) amplifiers adopt a wideband, low open-loop gain design. A minimal amount of negative feedback is used, but, more important, it is kept constant over the entire audio spectrum. This assures the proper timing between the primary signal and any amplifier distortion components. The sonic benefits of this design include powerful, high-resolution bass, a natural, richly detailed midrange, and smooth, clear highs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- Tagging the whole paragraph -->

In layman's term, HTA masked distortion through the primary signal.  While effective, total harmonic distortion for this technology was higher than Nakamichi's receivers utilizing Stasis technology. Whether sound quality improved or dissipated with this technology is left to the listener's ears.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- Tagging the whole paragraph -->

==Decline of Nakamichi==
Nakamichi's reputation for being the pioneer of audio cassettes no longer carried weight in the era of CDs. The lack of innovative digital technology meant Nakamichi was unable to successfully brand itself in the digital age. Further adding to its demise was a shrinking distribution channel as high-end audio boutiques were forced to close as they could not compete in a rapidly changing environment where shoppers gravitated towards electronic superstores. Ultimately, electronic consumers, who once were able to apply a significant portion of their outlay on audio-only components, needed to allocate more of their budget towards acquiring new video gear such as [[LaserDisc|laser disc players]], flat panel displays, DVD players, etc. In addition, a recession in the early 1990s caused many consumers to settle for mainstream electronics brands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- Tagging the whole paragraph -->

Toyota also stopped using Nakamichi systems in Lexus vehicles at this time, instead choosing [[Mark Levinson Audio Systems|Mark Levinson]] when Toyota made a deal with [[Harman International]] to provide premium audio systems in its vehicles in 2000. Bob Carter, General Manager for Lexus, also cited a lack of \"resonance\" with intended consumers as reasons for the switch.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- Tagging the whole paragraph -->

By the end of 1990s, Nakamichi failed to transition properly. In 1998, it was acquired by Grande Holdings, a Chinese company based in Hong Kong. Grande Holdings included electronics companies [[Akai]] and [[Sansui Electric|Sansui]].  Niro Nakamichi left in 1998 to set up Mechanical Research Corporation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- Tagging the whole paragraph -->

== Nakamichi under Grande Holdings==
The company went into [[bankruptcy]] protection on February 19, 2002.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20020220/nakami.htm | title= Nakamichi, apply for Civil Rehabilitation Law - debt 20 billion yen, shipping and maintenance carried out as before | website= AV Watch | publisher= Impress Corp. | date= 19 February 2002 | accessdate= 24 April 2015| language= Japanese}}</ref> In Nakamichi's defense, many high end audio manufacturers were also forced to merge or sell to larger holding companies during this time period partially influenced by the collapse of the Japanese \"[[Japanese asset price bubble|bubble economy]]\"; such well known companies include McIntosh and Mark Levinson.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

The company emerged from bankruptcy and repositioned itself as a manufacturer of high-end \"lifestyle systems\" in the same manner as [[Bang & Olufsen]]. They also manufacture [[CD changer]]s for hi-fi, computer, and car audio units.

In June 2006, Nakamichi released its first portable [[DVD player]] with built-in [[LCD]] screen, the Lumos.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Nakamichi kimono LED hi-res image.pdf|thumb|Nakamichi Kimono 3D LED TV with slim full brushed aluminium body]]From 2011, Nakamichi offered a complete line of mass market audio products, including earbuds, headphones, speakers, wireless speakers and sound bars. Also to target a younger demographic, they manufactured iPod docking systems and 3D LED TVs.

In 2014, Nakamichi moved back to its high-end roots and presented a 7.1 Pre-/main Amplifier combination AV1/AVP1.  <ref>[https://www.whathifi.com/nakamichi/av1avp1/review whathifi.com 15 May 2014, ''Nakamichi AV1/AVP1 review''] retrieved 13 April 2020.</ref>

In 2016, its focus shifted to soundbars by introducing its Shockwafe soundbar series. The first model, the Shockwafe Pro 7.1 soundbar, was the first soundbar to have 7 discrete surround channels. 

In 2018, Nakamichi added 4 more models into its Shockwafe lineup, incorporating dual-subwoofer and DTS:X technology into its design. During the 2018 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] held in Las Vegas, a series of blind listening battles were conducted for the public, including 2 exclusive sessions for members of the San Francisco Audiophile Society and private sessions to the media.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} Out of 204 people who participated, 81% voted Nakamichi Shockwafe Ultra 9.2 DTS:X Soundbar for best overall performance and 99% voted it for best overall value.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

In 2019, Nakamichi will be introducing 3 new soundbar models, integrated with Spatial Surround Elevation (SSE) processing technology, Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision and DTS:X. Nakamichi's Shockwafe Ultra 9.2 SSE Soundbar System was named a [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] 2019 Innovation Awards Honoree.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

==Niro Nakamichi==
In 2001, Niro Nakamichi, designer of many of the historic tape decks, started a new company, Mechanical Research Corporation, which introduced ultra high end audio amplifiers, preamplifiers, and an integrated amplifier, called \"engines.\" The products featured innovative designs and addressed issues of mechanical isolation, as well as presenting a unique appearance. Soon thereafter, however, the \"engine\" products were no longer promoted and a line of home theater products was introduced [http://www.niro1.com/en/].

'''Alastair Brian Walden''' (8 July 1932 – 9 May 2019) was a British journalist and broadcaster who spent over a decade as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]]. He was considered one of the finest political interviewers in the history of British broadcasting, tenacious and ruthless. He won awards for broadcasting including the [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA]] Richard Dimbleby Award for television in 1986,<ref name=\"BAFTA\">{{Cite news | url= http://awards.bafta.org/keyword-search?keywords=richard%20dimbleby%20award | title= BAFTA Awards Search | work=BAFTA | access-date=12 May 2019 | language=en-GB}}</ref> and in 1991 was named ITV personality of the year.<ref name=\"BBCWaldenDead\">{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48245853 | title= Brian Walden: Broadcaster and former Labour MP dies aged 86 | publisher=BBC News | access-date=12 May 2019 | language=en-GB}}</ref> He was known for interviews of politicians, especially [[Margaret Thatcher]].

==Early life==
Born in [[West Bromwich]], Walden was the son of a glass worker, and attended [[The Phoenix Collegiate|West Bromwich Grammar School]]. He won an open scholarship to [[The Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's College, Oxford]]. In 1957 he was elected president of the [[Oxford Union]].<ref>'Fall-Out The Biggest Worry For Oswestry Electors', ''The Times'' (30 October 1961), p. 6.</ref> After [[Oswald Mosley]] was invited to speak at a debate held on 24 October 1957, Walden was asked by a fellow undergraduate why Mosley had been invited. He replied, \"This society was founded many years ago to enshrine a very great principle, that of free speech. The society has had to fight against many authorities to ensure that minority points of view shall be put\".<ref>'Sir Oswald Mosley At Oxford Union', ''The Times'' (25 October 1957), p. 10.</ref> Walden apparently \"narrowly missed a first\" in history in his finals. The following year he undertook a speaking tour of the United States with Stuart Griffiths, during which he took part in 47 debates.<ref>'Debating Tour Of The U.S.', ''The Times'' (25 September 1958), p. 12.</ref>

He completed a postgraduate degree at [[Nuffield College, Oxford]], before becoming a university lecturer.

==Political career==
Walden unsuccessfully contested the safe Conservative [[constituency of Oswestry]] in the [[1961 Oswestry by-election|1961 by-election]], coming third for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]].

At a debate at the Oxford Union held on 11 June 1964, Walden caused uproar by calling [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], who had died two days previously, \"evil and repellent\" and for attacking the \"evil and despicable influence\" of his ''Express'' group of newspapers.<ref>'News in Brief', ''The Times'' (12 June 1964), p. 8.</ref>

At the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]] Walden was elected [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Birmingham All Saints (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham All Saints]] in an election where [[Smethwick in the 1964 general election|race dominated the Birmingham campaign]]. He was re-elected in the general elections of [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]] and [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]]. When All Saints was abolished Walden sought and gained the Labour nomination for [[Birmingham Ladywood (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Ladywood]], and was elected there in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]] and [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]].

In the aftermath of [[Enoch Powell]]'s November 1968 Eastbourne speech advocating the repatriation of immigrants, Walden urged the Prime Minister, [[Harold Wilson]], not to waver in his opposition to Powell's proposals: \"If the Government did waver and harass and bully some of Her Majesty's subjects towards the boats, British politics would sink to the gutter\".<ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1968/nov/21/minister-for-repatriation#S5CV0773P0_19681121_HOC_219 HC Deb 21 November 1968 vol 773 c. 1532-1533]</ref> In January 1970, Walden introduced his unsuccessful [[private member's bill]], the Right of Privacy Bill, that was designed to protect people's right to privacy from the press.<ref>George Clark and Pat Healy, 'Safeguards for journalists in privacy Bill', ''The Times'' (21 January 1970), p. 8.</ref>

In October 1971 Walden told an anti-[[European Economic Community|EEC]] meeting in Brighton that [[Roy Jenkins]] and others in the labour movement favoured Britain joining because they despaired of their country: \"They have grown sick of crisis after crisis and they do not believe that Britain, as an independent country, can solve her own problems. ... But they are wrong\".<ref>'Loyalty vital, Market rebels told', ''The Times'' (4 October 1971), p. 2.</ref> After Jenkins resigned from the deputy leadership in April 1972, Wilson appointed Walden to a junior position on Labour's shadow treasury team.<ref>'Promotion for EEC men in Mr Wilson's new Front Bench team', ''The Times'' (12 April 1972), p. 1.</ref> In October 1972 Walden attacked [[Dick Taverne]]'s \"apostasy\" for leaving the Labour Party: \"Of course an MP must have strong opinions of his own, and I have defied the Labour Party whip more than Dick Taverne has. We owe the Labour Party an unpayable debt and Dick has ratted on a lifetime of obligation\".<ref>'Mr Taverne 'not asking aid of MPs', ''The Times'' (9 October 1972), p. 2.</ref>

At a December 1973 meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on the state of the party, Walden doubted whether party unity and getting policies across to the public would alone suffice; the party's failure lay in not answering the questions ordinary people were asking.<ref>Michael Hatfield, 'Mr Wilson tells MPs to 'get back to the people' ', ''The Times'' (6 December 1973), p. 4.</ref> After [[Edward Heath]] called the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], Walden called it a \"fraudulent and rather ridiculous election\": \"The fault lies with the Prime Minister. I have as yet read no explanation of why the national interest requires that there should be a strike and an election before miners can be paid money they could be given without either taking place\".<ref name=\"Times1974\">Brian Walden, 'Perils of a battle only the losers can win', ''The Times'' (25 February 1974), p. 12.</ref> Walden lamented that \"the nation has been invited to nourish its fear and express class malice...I am living through the death of all my hopes of what this country could be\".<ref name=\"Times1974\"/> He called Heath's belief that the election was called to ensure moderation \"the most staggering misjudgment of my political lifetime\".<ref name=\"Times1974\"/>

Following Labour's return to office after the election, Walden declined the office of Minister of State for Industry, citing \"personal reasons\".<ref name=\"Times100674\">'MP explains job decision', ''The Times'' (10 June 1974), p. 4.</ref> The Selly Oak [[Constituency Labour Party]] passed a resolution criticising his \"massive consultancy fees\", which Walden earned as a parliamentary consultant to, among others, the Business Equipment Trades Association, the Amusement Trades Association and the Amusement Caterers Association.<ref name=\"Times100674\"/>

The [[Birmingham pub bombings]] of 21 November 1974 occurred in Walden's constituency, and soon afterwards, the Commons debated whether the death penalty should be restored for terrorist murderers. Walden opened the debate by opposing capital punishment, declaring it to be \"judicial execution\" and \"a cold-blooded act of the state to take a life\".<ref>Hugh Noyes, 'Death penalty would mean more violence, Home Secretary says', ''The Times'' (12 December 1974), p. 2.</ref> During the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]] on Britain's membership of the EEC, Walden spoke in favour of Britain remaining a member. Walden told the Commons: \"I think that the anti-Market campaign will in the end...degenerate into narrow nationalism, the plea for a siege economy, for Socialism in one country. I was never very enchanted by the rhapsodies of the Eurofanatics but I certainly prefer their version of the future to that grim and barren alternative which it seems to me the anti-Marketeers will end up with\".<ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1975/apr/08/european-community-membership#column_1040 HC Deb 08 April 1975 vol 889 c. 1040]</ref>

Walden became disillusioned with the Labour Party due to the rise of the left and in May 1975 (after [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s election as Conservative leader) he told the [[Chief Whip of the Conservative Party|Conservative Chief Whip]], [[Humphrey Atkins]], that he could bring six Labour MPs with him in [[crossing the floor]].<ref name=\"Moore\">Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume One: Not For Turning'' (London: Allen Lane, 2013), p. 345.</ref> According to Thatcher's biographer [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]], Walden was \"considered the most eloquent of his generation of Labour MPs\" and was \"more clear-sighted than most in seeing that Mrs Thatcher stood for real change\", commenting that \"as a grammar school meritocrat who had originally looked for social progress from the Labour Party, Walden recognized her as offering what he sought\".<ref name=\"Moore\"/>

At a meeting of the [[Warley East (UK Parliament constituency)|Warley East]] Labour Party in February 1976, Walden defended the government's policy and the benefits of the [[mixed economy]] against [[Stuart Holland]]'s proposals for more socialist policies.<ref>George Clark, 'Mr Faulds joins list of Labour MPs under attack from left-wingers in constituencies', ''The Times'' (1 March 1976), p. 2.</ref> In the [[1976 Labour Party leadership election|Labour leadership election]] that was held after Harold Wilson announced his resignation, Walden voted for [[Michael Foot]] rather than [[James Callaghan]] because he considered Foot \"a man of principle\".<ref>Kenneth O. Morgan, ''Michael Foot'' (London: Harper Perennial, 2008), p. 329.</ref> After the first 100 days of Callaghan's premiership, Walden remarked: \"If I had thought he was going to be as good as this I would have voted for him\".<ref>Geoffrey Smith, 'The calm strength of Mr Callaghan after his first 100 days', ''The Times'' (15 July 1976), p. 16.</ref>

In November 1976, Walden joined fellow right-wing Labour MP [[John Mackintosh (Scottish politician)|John Mackintosh]] in abstaining on the vote for the government's Dock Works Regulation Bill, thereby wrecking its passage through Parliament.<ref>'‘Rebel’ Labour MPs have no regrets', ''The Times'' (12 November 1976), p. 2.</ref> The Bill would have ensured that dock workers within five miles of any port or important inland waterway would have to belong to the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]].<ref>David Wood, 'Double defeat for Government wrecks docks Bill', ''The Times'' (11 November 1976), p. 1</ref> The executive committee of Walden's constituency Labour Party supported his stance,<ref>'Support for 'rebel' ', ''The Times'' (22 November 1976), p. 5.</ref> although he was criticised by left-wing demonstrators.<ref>David Leigh, 'Demonstrators air their complaints to MPs', ''The Times'' (18 November 1976),  p. 2.</ref> After the 1977 Budget, Walden claimed that: \"Our level of direct taxation—income tax—is ludicrously high, and our rate of indirect taxation is not taking enough of the burden\".<ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1977/may/09/hydrocarbon-oil-etc#column_972 HC Deb 09 May 1977 vol 931 c. 972]</ref>

He campaigned for the liberalisation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]<ref>In 1967 Walden signed a petition to the Home Secretary calling for the legalisation of cannabis. ''The Times'' (24 July 1967), p. 5.</ref> and [[gambling]] laws; he was nicknamed by some \"the bookies' MP\" when he was revealed to be receiving more from the National Association of Bookmakers than his parliamentary salary.

On 16 June 1977, Walden [[resignation from the British House of Commons|resigned]] from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by taking the [[Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds|Chiltern Hundreds]] in order to become a full-time journalist and broadcaster.<ref name=\"Times1977\">George Clark, 'Mr Walden to leave Commons for TV', ''The Times'' (17 June 1977), p. 1.</ref> Walden said: \"I am not leaving because of any disenchantment with the Government. I have gone for positive, not negative reasons\".<ref name=\"Times1977\"/>

==Journalistic career==
Walden went on to present television programmes, mostly for [[London Weekend Television]], such as ''[[Weekend World]]'', ''The Walden Interview'' and ''Walden''. He was also a member of the board of [[ITV Central|Central Television]] between 1981 and 1984.

In 1978, Walden told Conservative MP [[Bernard Weatherill]] that \"the only way the Tories can lose the next general election is if they are not Conservative enough\".<ref name=\"Moore\"/> By 1979, Walden passionately believed that trade union power should be broken, telling Margaret Thatcher that \"the trade unions have become an estate of the realm, above the law\".<ref name=\"Moore2\">Moore, ''Volume One'', p. 509, n.</ref> The week after this conversation, Walden's programme focused on the necessity of legislation against [[Solidarity action|secondary action]] by trade unions.<ref name=\"Moore2\"/>

In 1981, Geoffrey Wansell claimed that ''Weekend World'' had  become \"the flagship of national current affairs shows, quietly stealing the title from its more august rival at the BBC, Panorama\":

<blockquote>The secret of Weekend World's success, I suspect, lies in the character of its presenter and interviewer. Lacking the suave public school confidence of his predecessor in the job, [[Peter Jay (diplomat)|Peter Jay]], Walden runs on adrenalin and a determination to wring a bit of political revelation and a slice of history out of whichever politician happens to be in the studio with him. In spite of his voice, which vibrates on eardrums like a buzz-saw, Walden has become the second best political interviewer on television—only Sir [[Robin Day]] is better. ... Explaining his success, Walden simply says: \"I know I understand politicians, but even more I detest ambiguity. It's always my instinct to ask people exactly what they mean\".<ref>Geoffrey Wansell, 'Why Walden's World grabs headlines', ''The Times'' (11 September 1981), p. 40.</ref></blockquote>

During an interview with Thatcher in 1983, Walden coined the term \"Victorian values\" to describe her beliefs, which she accepted and repeated on numerous occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/105087 |title=TV Interview for London Weekend Television Weekend World (\"Victorian Values\") |publisher= Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date= 16 January 1983|accessdate= 8 June 2019}}</ref><ref>John Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 2003), p. 182.</ref><ref>Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: Everything She Wants'' (London: Allen Lane, 2015), p. 8.</ref> Walden wrote Thatcher's speech to the Wembley rally during the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] campaign.<ref>Campbell, p. 201.</ref> In 1988, he called Thatcher \"a unique politician...the master spirit of our age\".<ref>Campbell, p. 470.</ref>

After [[Rupert Murdoch]] moved the production of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' from Fleet Street to a new plant in [[Wapping]] in January 1986, the print unions voted to [[Wapping dispute|strike]] in protest. Many journalists deserted the paper but Walden lent it his support by becoming one of its senior columnists. He wrote to the paper's editor, [[Andrew Neil]]: \"I don't ''need'' to write for ''The Sunday Times''. I ''want'' to\".<ref>Andrew Neil, ''Full Disclosure'' (Pan, 1997), p. 173.</ref> In April 1988 Walden joined [[Norman Tebbit]], [[Frank Chapple|Lord Chapple]] and [[Lord Marsh]] in founding the Radical Society, designed to combat \"privilege, hierarchy, bureaucracy and collectivism\" and to put in their place individualist solutions.<ref>John Horam, 'The age of new enlightenment', ''The Times'' (25 April 1988), p. 12.</ref>

On 26 October 1989 the Chancellor, [[Nigel Lawson]], resigned because Thatcher was unwilling to sack her economics adviser, Sir [[Alan Walters]]. Although the interview had been planned months in advance, Walden interviewed Thatcher for the 29 October edition of ''The Walden Interview''. Walden told Thatcher's confidante [[Woodrow Wyatt]] on the day Lawson resigned that he wanted Wyatt to ask Thatcher what questions he should put to her so that he could phrase them in a helpful way.<ref>Sarah Curtis (ed.), ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt. Volume Two'' (London: Pan, 1999), p. 179.</ref> However, as [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]] notes, Walden's \"journalistic instinct and her lack of candour made for a devastating exposé, watched by three million people with their Sunday lunch\".<ref name=\"Campbell\">Campbell, p. 692.</ref> Although Thatcher repeatedly claimed that Lawson's position was \"unassailable\", she floundered when Walden asked what Campbell calls \"the killer question\":

<blockquote>
'''Brian Walden''': Do you deny that Nigel would have stayed if you had sacked Professor Alan Walters?<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': I don't know. I don't know.<br>'''Brian Walden''': You never even thought to ask him that?<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': I ... that is not ... I don't know.

I don't know ... of course I just don't know ... I'm not going on with this.<ref name=\"Campbell\"/>
</blockquote>

Later in the interview Walden put to her:

<blockquote>
'''Brian Walden''': You come over as being someone who one of your backbenchers said is slightly off her trolley, authoritarian, domineering, refusing to listen to anybody else – why? Why cannot you publicly project what you have just told me is your private character?<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': Brian, if anyone's coming over as domineering in this interview, it's you.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107808 |title=TV Interview for ''The Walden Interview'' (Lawson's resignation) |publisher= Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date= 28 October 1989|accessdate= 23 May 2009}}</ref>
</blockquote>

The following Sunday, Walden interviewed Lawson. In his memoirs Lawson said that Walden was \"at that time probably the most formidable and serious political interviewer in the business\".<ref>Nigel Lawson, ''The View From No. 11. Memoirs of a Tory Radical'' (London: Bantam, 1992), p. 967.</ref>

Upon leaving ''Weekend World'' as presenter in 1986, Walden was succeeded by [[Matthew Parris]],<ref name=\"BFIWalden\" /> formerly [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP for [[West Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Derbyshire]]; the series came to an end two years later. In 2005, Walden presented 10-minute programmes, ''A Point of View'', on [[BBC Radio 4]], in a spot formerly occupied by [[Alistair Cooke|Alistair Cooke's]] ''Letter From America''.

==Political satire==
As a well known public figure, Walden appeared in cameo as an interviewer for political comedy shows such as ''[[The New Statesman]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brian Walden (II) (1932–2019) |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0907062/ |website=IMDB |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref> He was the subject of parody in ''[[Spitting Image]]'' as a puppet with a slight speech impediment, voiced by impressionist [[Steve Nallon]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Spitting Image (1984–1996) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086807/characters/nm0620575 |website=IMDB |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Walden lived in [[Guernsey]] in retirement. He was married three times; to Sybil Blackstone, Jane McKerron, then Hazel Downes (for 43 years).

'''Alastair Brian Walden''' (8 July 1932 – 9 May 2019) was a British journalist and broadcaster who spent over a decade as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]]. He was considered one of the finest political interviewers in the history of British broadcasting, tenacious and ruthless. He won awards for broadcasting including the [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA]] Richard Dimbleby Award for television in 1986,<ref name=\"BAFTA\">{{Cite news | url= http://awards.bafta.org/keyword-search?keywords=richard%20dimbleby%20award | title= BAFTA Awards Search | work=BAFTA | access-date=12 May 2019 | language=en-GB}}</ref> and in 1991 was named ITV personality of the year.<ref name=\"BBCWaldenDead\">{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48245853 | title= Brian Walden: Broadcaster and former Labour MP dies aged 86 | publisher=BBC News | access-date=12 May 2019 | language=en-GB}}</ref> He was known for interviews of politicians, especially [[Margaret Thatcher]].

==Early life==
Born in [[West Bromwich]], Walden was the son of a glass worker, and attended [[The Phoenix Collegiate|West Bromwich Grammar School]]. He won an open scholarship to [[The Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's College, Oxford]]. In 1957 he was elected president of the [[Oxford Union]].<ref>'Fall-Out The Biggest Worry For Oswestry Electors', ''The Times'' (30 October 1961), p. 6.</ref> After [[Oswald Mosley]] was invited to speak at a debate held on 24 October 1957, Walden was asked by a fellow undergraduate why Mosley had been invited. He replied, \"This society was founded many years ago to enshrine a very great principle, that of free speech. The society has had to fight against many authorities to ensure that minority points of view shall be put\".<ref>'Sir Oswald Mosley At Oxford Union', ''The Times'' (25 October 1957), p. 10.</ref> Walden apparently \"narrowly missed a first\" in history in his finals. The following year he undertook a speaking tour of the United States with Stuart Griffiths, during which he took part in 47 debates.<ref>'Debating Tour Of The U.S.', ''The Times'' (25 September 1958), p. 12.</ref>

He completed a postgraduate degree at [[Nuffield College, Oxford]], before becoming a university lecturer.

==Political career==
Walden unsuccessfully contested the safe Conservative [[constituency of Oswestry]] in the [[1961 Oswestry by-election|1961 by-election]], coming third for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]].

At a debate at the Oxford Union held on 11 June 1964, Walden caused uproar by calling [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], who had died two days previously, \"evil and repellent\" and for attacking the \"evil and despicable influence\" of his ''Express'' group of newspapers.<ref>'News in Brief', ''The Times'' (12 June 1964), p. 8.</ref>

At the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]] Walden was elected [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Birmingham All Saints (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham All Saints]] in an election where [[Smethwick in the 1964 general election|race dominated the Birmingham campaign]]. He was re-elected in the general elections of [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]] and [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]]. When All Saints was abolished Walden sought and gained the Labour nomination for [[Birmingham Ladywood (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Ladywood]], and was elected there in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]] and [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]].

In the aftermath of [[Enoch Powell]]'s November 1968 Eastbourne speech advocating the repatriation of immigrants, Walden urged the Prime Minister, [[Harold Wilson]], not to waver in his opposition to Powell's proposals: \"If the Government did waver and harass and bully some of Her Majesty's subjects towards the boats, British politics would sink to the gutter\".<ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1968/nov/21/minister-for-repatriation#S5CV0773P0_19681121_HOC_219 HC Deb 21 November 1968 vol 773 c. 1532-1533]</ref> In January 1970, Walden introduced his unsuccessful [[private member's bill]], the Right of Privacy Bill, that was designed to protect people's right to privacy from the press.<ref>George Clark and Pat Healy, 'Safeguards for journalists in privacy Bill', ''The Times'' (21 January 1970), p. 8.</ref>

In October 1971 Walden told an anti-[[European Economic Community|EEC]] meeting in Brighton that [[Roy Jenkins]] and others in the labour movement favoured Britain joining because they despaired of their country: \"They have grown sick of crisis after crisis and they do not believe that Britain, as an independent country, can solve her own problems. ... But they are wrong\".<ref>'Loyalty vital, Market rebels told', ''The Times'' (4 October 1971), p. 2.</ref> After Jenkins resigned from the deputy leadership in April 1972, Wilson appointed Walden to a junior position on Labour's shadow treasury team.<ref>'Promotion for EEC men in Mr Wilson's new Front Bench team', ''The Times'' (12 April 1972), p. 1.</ref> In October 1972 Walden attacked [[Dick Taverne]]'s \"apostasy\" for leaving the Labour Party: \"Of course an MP must have strong opinions of his own, and I have defied the Labour Party whip more than Dick Taverne has. We owe the Labour Party an unpayable debt and Dick has ratted on a lifetime of obligation\".<ref>'Mr Taverne 'not asking aid of MPs', ''The Times'' (9 October 1972), p. 2.</ref>

At a December 1973 meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on the state of the party, Walden doubted whether party unity and getting policies across to the public would alone suffice; the party's failure lay in not answering the questions ordinary people were asking.<ref>Michael Hatfield, 'Mr Wilson tells MPs to 'get back to the people' ', ''The Times'' (6 December 1973), p. 4.</ref> After [[Edward Heath]] called the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], Walden called it a \"fraudulent and rather ridiculous election\": \"The fault lies with the Prime Minister. I have as yet read no explanation of why the national interest requires that there should be a strike and an election before miners can be paid money they could be given without either taking place\".<ref name=\"Times1974\">Brian Walden, 'Perils of a battle only the losers can win', ''The Times'' (25 February 1974), p. 12.</ref> Walden lamented that \"the nation has been invited to nourish its fear and express class malice...I am living through the death of all my hopes of what this country could be\".<ref name=\"Times1974\"/> He called Heath's belief that the election was called to ensure moderation \"the most staggering misjudgment of my political lifetime\".<ref name=\"Times1974\"/>

Following Labour's return to office after the election, Walden declined the office of Minister of State for Industry, citing \"personal reasons\".<ref name=\"Times100674\">'MP explains job decision', ''The Times'' (10 June 1974), p. 4.</ref> The Selly Oak [[Constituency Labour Party]] passed a resolution criticising his \"massive consultancy fees\", which Walden earned as a parliamentary consultant to, among others, the Business Equipment Trades Association, the Amusement Trades Association and the Amusement Caterers Association.<ref name=\"Times100674\"/>

The [[Birmingham pub bombings]] of 21 November 1974 occurred in Walden's constituency, and soon afterwards, the Commons debated whether the death penalty should be restored for terrorist murderers. Walden opened the debate by opposing capital punishment, declaring it to be \"judicial execution\" and \"a cold-blooded act of the state to take a life\".<ref>Hugh Noyes, 'Death penalty would mean more violence, Home Secretary says', ''The Times'' (12 December 1974), p. 2.</ref> During the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]] on Britain's membership of the EEC, Walden spoke in favour of Britain remaining a member. Walden told the Commons: \"I think that the anti-Market campaign will in the end...degenerate into narrow nationalism, the plea for a siege economy, for Socialism in one country. I was never very enchanted by the rhapsodies of the Eurofanatics but I certainly prefer their version of the future to that grim and barren alternative which it seems to me the anti-Marketeers will end up with\".<ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1975/apr/08/european-community-membership#column_1040 HC Deb 08 April 1975 vol 889 c. 1040]</ref>

Walden became disillusioned with the Labour Party due to the rise of the left and in May 1975 (after [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s election as Conservative leader) he told the [[Chief Whip of the Conservative Party|Conservative Chief Whip]], [[Humphrey Atkins]], that he could bring six Labour MPs with him in [[crossing the floor]].<ref name=\"Moore\">Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume One: Not For Turning'' (London: Allen Lane, 2013), p. 345.</ref> According to Thatcher's biographer [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]], Walden was \"considered the most eloquent of his generation of Labour MPs\" and was \"more clear-sighted than most in seeing that Mrs Thatcher stood for real change\", commenting that \"as a grammar school meritocrat who had originally looked for social progress from the Labour Party, Walden recognized her as offering what he sought\".<ref name=\"Moore\"/>

At a meeting of the [[Warley East (UK Parliament constituency)|Warley East]] Labour Party in February 1976, Walden defended the government's policy and the benefits of the [[mixed economy]] against [[Stuart Holland]]'s proposals for more socialist policies.<ref>George Clark, 'Mr Faulds joins list of Labour MPs under attack from left-wingers in constituencies', ''The Times'' (1 March 1976), p. 2.</ref> In the [[1976 Labour Party leadership election|Labour leadership election]] that was held after Harold Wilson announced his resignation, Walden voted for [[Michael Foot]] rather than [[James Callaghan]] because he considered Foot \"a man of principle\".<ref>Kenneth O. Morgan, ''Michael Foot'' (London: Harper Perennial, 2008), p. 329.</ref> After the first 100 days of Callaghan's premiership, Walden remarked: \"If I had thought he was going to be as good as this I would have voted for him\".<ref>Geoffrey Smith, 'The calm strength of Mr Callaghan after his first 100 days', ''The Times'' (15 July 1976), p. 16.</ref>

In November 1976, Walden joined fellow right-wing Labour MP [[John Mackintosh (Scottish politician)|John Mackintosh]] in abstaining on the vote for the government's Dock Works Regulation Bill, thereby wrecking its passage through Parliament.<ref>'‘Rebel’ Labour MPs have no regrets', ''The Times'' (12 November 1976), p. 2.</ref> The Bill would have ensured that dock workers within five miles of any port or important inland waterway would have to belong to the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]].<ref>David Wood, 'Double defeat for Government wrecks docks Bill', ''The Times'' (11 November 1976), p. 1</ref> The executive committee of Walden's constituency Labour Party supported his stance,<ref>'Support for 'rebel' ', ''The Times'' (22 November 1976), p. 5.</ref> although he was criticised by left-wing demonstrators.<ref>David Leigh, 'Demonstrators air their complaints to MPs', ''The Times'' (18 November 1976),  p. 2.</ref> After the 1977 Budget, Walden claimed that: \"Our level of direct taxation—income tax—is ludicrously high, and our rate of indirect taxation is not taking enough of the burden\".<ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1977/may/09/hydrocarbon-oil-etc#column_972 HC Deb 09 May 1977 vol 931 c. 972]</ref>

He campaigned for the liberalisation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]<ref>In 1967 Walden signed a petition to the Home Secretary calling for the legalisation of cannabis. ''The Times'' (24 July 1967), p. 5.</ref> and [[gambling]] laws; he was nicknamed by some \"the bookies' MP\" when he was revealed to be receiving more from the National Association of Bookmakers than his parliamentary salary.

On 16 June 1977, Walden [[resignation from the British House of Commons|resigned]] from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by taking the [[Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds|Chiltern Hundreds]] in order to become a full-time journalist and broadcaster.<ref name=\"Times1977\">George Clark, 'Mr Walden to leave Commons for TV', ''The Times'' (17 June 1977), p. 1.</ref> Walden said: \"I am not leaving because of any disenchantment with the Government. I have gone for positive, not negative reasons\".<ref name=\"Times1977\"/>

==Journalistic career==
Walden went on to present television programmes, mostly for [[London Weekend Television]], such as ''[[Weekend World]]'', ''The Walden Interview'' and ''Walden''. He was also a member of the board of [[ITV Central|Central Television]] between 1981 and 1984.

In 1978, Walden told Conservative MP [[Bernard Weatherill]] that \"the only way the Tories can lose the next general election is if they are not Conservative enough\".<ref name=\"Moore\"/> By 1979, Walden passionately believed that trade union power should be broken, telling Margaret Thatcher that \"the trade unions have become an estate of the realm, above the law\".<ref name=\"Moore2\">Moore, ''Volume One'', p. 509, n.</ref> The week after this conversation, Walden's programme focused on the necessity of legislation against [[Solidarity action|secondary action]] by trade unions.<ref name=\"Moore2\"/>

In 1981, Geoffrey Wansell claimed that ''Weekend World'' had  become \"the flagship of national current affairs shows, quietly stealing the title from its more august rival at the BBC, Panorama\":

<blockquote>The secret of Weekend World's success, I suspect, lies in the character of its presenter and interviewer. Lacking the suave public school confidence of his predecessor in the job, [[Peter Jay (diplomat)|Peter Jay]], Walden runs on adrenalin and a determination to wring a bit of political revelation and a slice of history out of whichever politician happens to be in the studio with him. In spite of his voice, which vibrates on eardrums like a buzz-saw, Walden has become the second best political interviewer on television—only Sir [[Robin Day]] is better. ... Explaining his success, Walden simply says: \"I know I understand politicians, but even more I detest ambiguity. It's always my instinct to ask people exactly what they mean\".<ref>Geoffrey Wansell, 'Why Walden's World grabs headlines', ''The Times'' (11 September 1981), p. 40.</ref></blockquote>

During an interview with Thatcher in 1983, Walden coined the term \"Victorian values\" to describe her beliefs, which she accepted and repeated on numerous occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/105087 |title=TV Interview for London Weekend Television Weekend World (\"Victorian Values\") |publisher= Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date= 16 January 1983|accessdate= 8 June 2019}}</ref><ref>John Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 2003), p. 182.</ref><ref>Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: Everything She Wants'' (London: Allen Lane, 2015), p. 8.</ref> Walden wrote Thatcher's speech to the Wembley rally during the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] campaign.<ref>Campbell, p. 201.</ref> In 1988, he called Thatcher \"a unique politician...the master spirit of our age\".<ref>Campbell, p. 470.</ref>

After [[Rupert Murdoch]] moved the production of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' from Fleet Street to a new plant in [[Wapping]] in January 1986, the print unions voted to [[Wapping dispute|strike]] in protest. Many journalists deserted the paper but Walden lent it his support by becoming one of its senior columnists. He wrote to the paper's editor, [[Andrew Neil]]: \"I don't ''need'' to write for ''The Sunday Times''. I ''want'' to\".<ref>Andrew Neil, ''Full Disclosure'' (Pan, 1997), p. 173.</ref> In April 1988 Walden joined [[Norman Tebbit]], [[Frank Chapple|Lord Chapple]] and [[Lord Marsh]] in founding the Radical Society, designed to combat \"privilege, hierarchy, bureaucracy and collectivism\" and to put in their place individualist solutions.<ref>John Horam, 'The age of new enlightenment', ''The Times'' (25 April 1988), p. 12.</ref>

On 26 October 1989 the Chancellor, [[Nigel Lawson]], resigned because Thatcher was unwilling to sack her economics adviser, Sir [[Alan Walters]]. Although the interview had been planned months in advance, Walden interviewed Thatcher for the 29 October edition of ''The Walden Interview''. Walden told Thatcher's confidante [[Woodrow Wyatt]] on the day Lawson resigned that he wanted Wyatt to ask Thatcher what questions he should put to her so that he could phrase them in a helpful way.<ref>Sarah Curtis (ed.), ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt. Volume Two'' (London: Pan, 1999), p. 179.</ref> However, as [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]] notes, Walden's \"journalistic instinct and her lack of candour made for a devastating exposé, watched by three million people with their Sunday lunch\".<ref name=\"Campbell\">Campbell, p. 692.</ref> Although Thatcher repeatedly claimed that Lawson's position was \"unassailable\", she floundered when Walden asked what Campbell calls \"the killer question\":

Later in the interview Walden put to her:

<blockquote>
'''Brian Walden''': You come over as being someone who one of your backbenchers said is slightly off her trolley, authoritarian, domineering, refusing to listen to anybody else – why? Why cannot you publicly project what you have just told me is your private character?<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': Brian, if anyone's coming over as domineering in this interview, it's you.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107808 |title=TV Interview for ''The Walden Interview'' (Lawson's resignation) |publisher= Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date= 28 October 1989|accessdate= 23 May 2009}}</ref>
