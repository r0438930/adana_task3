Omata, Mangorei Swifts, Carrington and New Plymouth with rugby clubs Star and Tukapa among the original teams from Taranaki's largest town competing for the Julian Cup. In 1905 Waitara and [[Urenui]] formed teams. By 1906 New Plymouth AFC had become New Plymouth East and New Plymouth West.  \n\nThe New Plymouth clubs relied mainly on the port and it's visiting ships crew for competition with only the Julian Cup to compete for. Auckland champions Corinthians visited New Plymouth playing the Taranaki champions New Plymouth AFC in 1904 and champions Waitara in 1905. \n\nIn 1909 [[Wellington Diamond|Diamond]], who won the 1908 Wellington championship, played Taranaki champions Kaponga at Kaponga.  \n\nIn 1913 the New Plymouth clubs comprised of the Wanderers, the Watersiders, Albion FC, and the Swifts. After the first world war many of the early clubs were never brought out of recess.\n\nOriginally Moturoa FC was a shortlived rugby club, started by the Breakwater Sports Committee in the kiosk at Ngamotu Beach in early 1914 before amalgamating with the Star club. Moturoa FC's home ground was the prison reserve field at Otaka Street. The club retained one junior team that played in the club's colour, white, with a star emblem. \n\nThe Julian Cup for the Taranaki Championship was suspended from 1913. The 1912 champion was Kaponga. The 1913 competition result, protested by Stratford, Auroa and Hawera, was eventually cancelled by the Taranaki association.  \n\nIn 1918 the troop ship SS Waiwera would play a New Plymouth side. The Waiwera team had Mr. George Rendall on it's side. Before leaving England he would play four games for the [[West Ham United F.C. Under-23s and Academy|West Ham Reserves]] in London. Residing in New Zealand he would go on to play for Albion FC among other New Plymouth sides until retiring from playing in 1933. Rendall represented Moturoa on the TFA from 1931, coaching the game locally by the end of the decade at the High School. One player identified as talented early by Rendall was future Old Boys and Moturoa player Ted Meuli with Rendall stating in 1975 from his Bayly Road address that he was the \"most promising player he ever saw\" and \"would go a long way in the right team\".<ref>Taranaki Herald\n\nFriday, May 30th, 1975\n\npg 7. \"Soccer links go back 54 years\"</ref>Mr. Rendall's three step-sons Norm, Des and Bob Quinlan would all later go on to play football in New Plymouth with Norm the captain of Moturoa in the mid-1940's.  \n\nIn 1919 local football resumed with soldiers who had played football prior to the war returning back to New Plymouth playing overseas visiting ships in local invitation games or unofficial one off matches.   \n\n1921 - The Taranaki football association was organised from South Taranaki at this time. \n\n1922 - In the first North and South Taranaki fixture since 1913 New Plymouth AFC play a well drilled Hawera at the Waiwhakaiho Showground, New Plymouth.  \n\nHawera had played matches with teams from Wanganui along with the other resurgent South Taranaki clubs and took the game easily. Hawera won the Julian Cup in 1922 and also 1923. \n\nMr G.E. Jones from Hawera becomes the first player from Taranaki to be selected for a New Zealand representative side when selected in 1923 for the New Zealand XI tour of Australia.

Omata, Mangorei Swifts, Carrington and New Plymouth with rugby clubs Star and Tukapa among the original teams from Taranaki's largest town competing for the Julian Cup. In 1905 Waitara and [[Urenui]] formed teams. By 1906 New Plymouth AFC had become New Plymouth East and New Plymouth West.  \n\nThe New Plymouth clubs relied mainly on the port and it's visiting ships crew for competition with only the Julian Cup to compete for. Auckland champions Corinthians visited New Plymouth playing the Taranaki champions New Plymouth AFC in 1904 and champions Waitara in 1905. \n\nIn 1909 [[Wellington Diamond|Diamond]], who won the 1908 Wellington championship, played Taranaki champions Kaponga at Kaponga.  \n\nIn 1913 the New Plymouth clubs comprised of the Wanderers, the Watersiders, Albion FC, and the Swifts. After the first world war many of the early clubs were never brought out of recess.\n\nOriginally Moturoa FC was a shortlived rugby club, started by the Breakwater Sports Committee in the kiosk at Ngamotu Beach in early 1914 before amalgamating with the Star club. Moturoa FC's home ground was the prison reserve field at Otaka Street. The club retained one junior team that played in the club's colour, white, with a star emblem. \n\nThe Julian Cup for the Taranaki Championship was suspended from 1913. The 1912 champion was Kaponga. The 1913 competition result, protested by Stratford, Auroa and Hawera, was eventually cancelled by the Taranaki association.  \n\nIn 1918 the troop ship SS Waiwera would play a New Plymouth side. The Waiwera team had Mr. George Rendall on it's side. Before leaving England he would play four games for the [[West Ham United F.C. Under-23s and Academy|West Ham Reserves]] in London. Residing in New Zealand he would go on to play for Albion FC among other New Plymouth sides until retiring from playing in 1933. Rendall represented Moturoa on the TFA from 1931, coaching the game locally by the end of the decade at the High School. One player identified as talented early by Rendall was future Old Boys and Moturoa player Ted Meuli with Rendall stating in 1975 from his Bayly Road address that he was the \"most promising player he ever saw\" and \"would go a long way in the right team\".<ref>Taranaki Herald\n\nFriday, May 30th, 1975\n\npg 7. \"Soccer links go back 54 years\"</ref>Mr. Rendall's three step-sons Norm, Des and Bob Quinlan would all later go on to play football in New Plymouth with Norm the captain of Moturoa in the mid-1940's.  \n\nIn 1919 local football resumed with soldiers who had played football prior to the war returning back to New Plymouth playing overseas visiting ships in local invitation games or unofficial one off matches.   \n\n1921 - The Taranaki football association was organised from South Taranaki at this time. \n\n1922 - In the first North and South Taranaki fixture since 1913 New Plymouth AFC play a well drilled Hawera at the Waiwhakaiho Showground, New Plymouth.  \n\nHawera had played matches with teams from Wanganui along with the other resurgent South Taranaki clubs and took the game easily. \n\nHawera won the Julian Cup in 1922 and also 1923.  \n\nG.E. Jones from Hawera becomes the first player from Taranaki to be selected for a New Zealand representative side when selected in 1923 for the New Zealand XI tour of Australia. Jones would play a single match against the North Coast at [[Nambour, Queensland|Nambour]], Queensland in a 2-0 win.<ref>{{Cite web|title=|url=https://www.ultimatenzsoccer.com/NZRepSoccer/1904_49.htm|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nThe Moturoa School opened in 1923 after years of deliberation.\n\n1924 - China's Universities team toured New Zealand in August and played a Taranaki team at Hawera playing out a draw, 1-1.  \n\nKaponga win the Julian Cup.\n\n1925 - A silver cup is donated to the Taranaki Football Association by the Chinese residents of Taranaki in commemoration of the teams visit.
