It operated worldwide holiday charter services mainly for its parent company, the [[MyTravel Group]]. The airline merged with [[Thomas Cook Airlines|Thomas Cook Airlines UK Limited]] in 2008 and was renamed [[Thomas Cook Airlines|Thomas Cook Airlines Limited]].\n\nThe airline was founded in 1990 as Airtours International Airways and was to be the in-house airline for Airtours Holidays, (Going Places Travel Agent). In 1993 they purchased Inter European Airways and the fleet was merged. In 2002 Airtours changed their brand name to MyTravel and therefore Airtours International Airways became MyTravel Airways. During 2007 the MyTravel Group agreed to merge with [[Thomas Cook AG]], and on 30 March 2008, MyTravel Airways was fully integrated into [[Thomas Cook Airlines]].\n\n[[MyTravel Airways A/S]] was the [[Denmark|Danish]] sister airline of MyTravel Airways, which was re-branded [[Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia]] on 8 May 2008.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Airtours]] tour operating company was founded by David Crossland and established its own in-house airline, [[Airtours International Airways]], on 1 October 1990.<ref name=\"FI\">{{cite news | title= Directory: World Airlines | work= [[Flight International]] | pages= 53\u201354 | date= 10 April 2007}}</ref> It started operations on 11 March 1991 flying [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80/MD-90|McDonnell Douglas MD-80]] aircraft to destinations throughout Europe.\n\n[[Cardiff]]-based Aspro Holidays and their inhouse airline, Inter European Airways were acquired and integrated in November 1993 adding new aircraft types such as the [[Boeing 757]] and [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] to the fleet. The MD83's were replaced in 1995\u20131996 with more Airbus A320s. In 1996 the parent company also acquired [[Denmark|Danish]] charter airline Premiair. Airtours also had operations in [[Germany]] with airline FlyFTi,<ref name=\"FI\"/> operating Airbus A320s until this was merged back into the UK fleet during 2003.\n\nIn the 1990s Airtours added long haul capabilities, with the addition of the [[Boeing 767]] and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], flying holiday makers to destinations including the [[Caribbean]] and the [[United States|USA]]. More Airbus aircraft joined the fleet during the 1990s with Airbus A320s, [[Airbus A321]]s and [[Airbus A330]]s accompanying the fleet of [[Boeing 757]]s, Boeing 767s and DC-10s. In 1995, the airline began offering pre-bookable seats, meal choices and duty-free on its flights \u2013 a practice that was subsequently adopted by many other UK charter airlines. The [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-200]] aircraft delivered to Airtours in 1999 featured improved passenger amenities over older long haul aircraft and offered Premium Economy cabins in the form of ''Premiair Gold'', something the Boeing 767 and DC-10 did not offer at the time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} The Airbus A330-200's, operated by Thomas Cook for their long haul flights, were known for their unique cabin design. The special design forfeited several rows of seats in the middle of the plane for a steep staircase down to a lower partial deck, which incorporated a galley, three jumps seats, and 4 toilets.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nOn 27 January 2002, Airtours International became the first airline to use the new Swanwick Air Traffic Centre, as flight AIH550 from [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria|Las Palmas]] to [[Birmingham Airport|Birmingham]] was handed over to the new facility.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1784121.stm BBC News | UK | 'Smooth switch' for air traffic HQ]</ref>\n\nFollowing the renaming of the Airtours Group to the [[MyTravel Group]] in February 2002, the Airtours International and Premiair operations were rebranded as MyTravel Airways with effect from 1 May 2002. In October 2002 MyTravel Airways launched its scheduled [[Low-cost carrier|low-fare airline]], MyTravelLite, but this was reintegrated in 2003.<ref name=\"FI\"/>\n\nIn common with airlines worldwide, MyTravel Airways saw a reduction in customers due to the effects of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. Official statistics from the [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority]] (see reference below) indicated that the number of passengers carried by MyTravel Airways UK increased from 7.21 million in 2001 to 7.52 million in 2002. However, the figure dropped to 4.38 million in 2005, due to the number of aircraft being reduced from 45 in early 2001 to 29 in 2005, as part of the restructuring of the wider MyTravel Group.[[File:mytravel.a320.takeoff.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|MyTravel Airways [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320-200]] at take-off]]\n\nIn late 2004 the last of the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]s and the last [[Boeing 757]] were withdrawn from the fleet. MyTravel Airways was the last British airline to operate DC-10s. In December 2005, MyTravel Aircraft Engineering (MTAE) became a wholly owned subsidiary of the MyTravel Group, based at Manchester Airport. The facility performed all light maintenance checks (up to 'C' Check) for MyTravel Airways and MyTravel Airways A/S, as well as work for third party airlines such as Skyservice, and has now been re-branded Thomas Cook Airlines Engineering following the merger.\n \nMyTravel Aircraft Engineering Caribbean, part of MTAE had bases throughout the Caribbean in [[Canc\u00fan]], [[Cozumel]], [[Montego Bay]], [[Newark, New Jersey]] and [[Sanford, Florida]], as well as seasonal bases at various Spanish, Greek and Turkish airports as well as [[Jeddah]] for the [[Hajj]] operation. It handled more than 3500 aircraft for over 40 airlines a year. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nDue to necessary consolidation within the UK IT market, MyTravel Group PLC and Thomas Cook AG agreed to merge in March 2007 to form Thomas Cook Group PLC. Under the merger, MyTravel Airways and Thomas Cook Airlines fleets became one and the airlines became Thomas Cook Airlines, operating under MyTravel's AOC.
