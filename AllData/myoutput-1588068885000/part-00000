Catesby may have embarked on the scheme after hopes of securing greater religious tolerance under [[James VI and I |King James]] had faded, leaving many English Catholics disappointed. His fellow plotters were [[John and Christopher Wright]], [[Robert and Thomas Wintour]], [[Thomas Percy (Gunpowder Plot)|Thomas Percy]], [[Guy Fawkes]], [[Robert Keyes]], [[Thomas Bates]], [[John Grant (Gunpowder Plot)|John Grant]], [[Ambrose Rookwood]], Sir [[Everard Digby]] and [[Francis Tresham]].  Fawkes, who had 10&nbsp;years of military experience fighting in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in the failed suppression of the [[Dutch Revolt]], was given charge of the explosives.\n\nThe plot was revealed to the authorities in an anonymous letter sent to [[William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle]], on 26 October 1605. During a search of the House of Lords in the evening on 4 November 1605, Fawkes was discovered guarding 36&nbsp;barrels of [[gunpowder]]\u2014enough to reduce the House of Lords to rubble\u2014and arrested. Most of the conspirators fled from London as they learned of the plot's discovery, trying to enlist support along the way. Several made a stand against the pursuing Sheriff of Worcester and his men at [[Holbeche House]]; in the ensuing battle, Catesby was one of those shot and killed. At their trial on 27 January 1606, eight of the survivors, including Fawkes, were convicted and sentenced to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]].\n\nDetails of the assassination attempt were allegedly known by the principal [[Jesuit]] of England, Father [[Henry Garnet]]. Although he was convicted of [[treason]] and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through [[Confession (religion)#Roman Catholicism|confession]], Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the [[Seal of the Confessional in the Catholic Church|absolute confidentiality of the confessional]]. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during [[James VI and I|King James's]] reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as the ringing of church bells, which have evolved into the [[Guy Fawkes Night|Bonfire Night]] of today.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Religion in England===\n{{Main|English Reformation}}\n{{See also|Catholic Church in England and Wales}}\n[[File:Elizabeth I George Gower.jpg|thumb|alt=A three-quarter portrait of a middle-aged woman wearing a tiara, bodice, puffed-out sleeves, and a lace ruff.

The backdrop is mostly black.|Elizabeth&nbsp;I]]\n\nBetween 1533 and 1540, [[King Henry VIII]] took control of the English Church from Rome, the start of several decades of religious tension in England.  English Catholics struggled in a society dominated by the newly separate and increasingly [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Church of England]].  Henry's daughter, [[Queen Elizabeth I]], responded to the growing religious divide by introducing the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], which required anyone appointed to a public or church office to swear allegiance to the monarch as head of the Church and state. The penalties for refusal were severe; fines were imposed for [[recusancy]], and repeat offenders risked imprisonment and execution.  Catholicism became marginalised, but despite the threat of torture or execution, priests continued to practise their faith in secret.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=12}}</ref>\n\n===Succession===\nQueen Elizabeth, unmarried and childless, steadfastly refused to name an heir. Many Catholics believed that her Catholic cousin, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], was the legitimate heir to the English throne, but she was executed for treason in 1587.  The [[English Secretary of State]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], negotiated secretly with Mary's son and successor, King [[James VI of Scotland]]. In the months before Elizabeth's death on 24 March 1603, Cecil prepared the way for James to succeed her.{{efn|Salisbury wrote to James, \"The subject itself is so perilous to touch amongst us as it setteth a mark upon his head forever that hatcheth such a bird\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Willson|1963|p=154}}</ref>}}\n\nSome exiled Catholics favoured [[Philip II of Spain]]'s daughter, [[Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella]], as Elizabeth's successor.  More moderate Catholics looked to James's and Elizabeth's cousin [[Arbella Stuart]], a woman thought to have Catholic sympathies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=15}}</ref>  As Elizabeth's health deteriorated, the government detained those they considered to be the \"principal papists\",<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=xxv\u2013xxvi}}</ref> and the [[Privy Council]] grew so worried that Arbella Stuart was moved closer to [[London]] to prevent her from being kidnapped by [[papist]]s.<ref name=\"Fraserpxxv\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=xxv}}</ref>\n\nDespite competing claims to the English throne, the transition of power following Elizabeth's death went smoothly.{{efn|The [[heir presumptive]] under the terms of [[Henry VIII's will]], i.e. either [[Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp]], or [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven]], depending on whether one recognised the legitimacy of the first-mentioned's birth; and  the Lady [[Arbella Stuart]] on grounds similar to James's own.}}  James's succession was announced by a proclamation from Cecil on 24 March, which was generally celebrated.  Leading papists, rather than causing trouble as anticipated, reacted to the news by offering their enthusiastic support for the new monarch.  [[Jesuit]] priests, whose presence in England was punishable by death, also demonstrated their support for James, who was widely believed to embody \"the natural order of things\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=xxvii\u2013xxix}}</ref>  James ordered a ceasefire in the conflict with Spain, and even though the two countries were still technically at war, [[Philip III of Spain|King Philip III]] sent his envoy, [[Juan de Tassis y Peralta, 2nd Count of Villamediana|Don Juan de Tassis]], to congratulate James on his accession.<ref name=\"Fraserp91\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=91}}</ref><!-- James and Tassis first met 8 November, Fraser p94 --> In the following year both countries signed the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]]. \n\nFor decades, the English had lived under a monarch who refused to provide an heir, but James arrived with a family and a clear line of succession.  His wife, [[Anne of Denmark]], was the daughter of a [[Frederick II of Denmark|king]].  Their eldest child, the nine-year-old [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry]], was considered a handsome and confident boy, and their two younger children, [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles]], were proof that James was able to provide heirs to continue the Protestant monarchy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=70\u201374}}</ref>\n\n===Early reign of James I===\nJames's attitude towards Catholics was more moderate than that of his predecessor, perhaps even tolerant. He promised that he would not \"persecute any that will be quiet and give an outward obedience to the law\",<ref>{{Harvnb|Brice|1994|p=88}}</ref> and believed that exile was a better solution than capital punishment: \"I would be glad to have both their heads and their bodies separated from this whole island and transported beyond seas.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=46}}</ref>  Some Catholics believed that the martyrdom of James's mother, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], would encourage James to convert to the Catholic faith, and the Catholic houses of Europe may also have shared that hope.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=xxx\u2013xxxi}}</ref>  James received an envoy from [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert VII]],<ref name=\"Fraserp91\"/> ruler of the remaining Catholic territories in the Netherlands after over 30&nbsp;years of war in the [[Dutch Revolt]] by English-supported Protestant rebels.  For the Catholic expatriates engaged in that struggle, the restoration by force of a Catholic monarchy was an intriguing possibility, but following the failed [[Spanish invasion of England]] in 1588 the papacy had taken a longer-term view on the return of a Catholic monarch to the English throne.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=7}}</ref>\n\nDuring the late 16th century, Catholics made several assassination attempts on Protestant rulers in Europe and in England, including plans to poison Elizabeth I. The Jesuit [[Juan de Mariana]]'s 1598 ''On Kings and the Education of Kings'' explicitly justified the assassination of the French king [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]\u2014who had been stabbed to death by [[Jacques Cl\u00e9ment|a Catholic fanatic]] in 1589\u2014and until the 1620s, some English Catholics believed that regicide was justifiable to remove tyrants from power.<ref name=MarshallP227>{{Harvnb|Marshall|2006|p=227}}</ref> Much of the \"rather nervous\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=32\u201333}}</ref> James's political writing was \"concerned with the threat of Catholic assassination and refutation of the [Catholic] argument that 'faith did not need to be kept with heretics'\".<ref name=MarshallP228>{{Harvnb|Marshall|2006|p=228}}</ref>\n\n===Early plots===\nIn the absence of any sign that James would move to end the persecution of Catholics, as some had hoped for, several members of the [[clergy]] (including two anti-Jesuit priests) decided to take matters into their own hands.  In what became known as the [[Bye Plot]], the priests [[William Watson (priest)|William Watson]] and [[William Clark (priest)|William Clark]] planned to kidnap James and hold him in the Tower of London until he agreed to be more tolerant towards Catholics. Cecil received news of the plot from several sources, including the [[Archpriest]] [[George Blackwell]], who instructed his priests to have no part in any such schemes. At about the same time, [[Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham|Lord Cobham]], [[Thomas Grey, 15th Baron Grey de Wilton|Lord Grey de Wilton]], [[Griffin Markham]] and [[Walter Raleigh]] hatched what became known as the [[Main Plot]], which involved removing James and his family and supplanting them with [[Arbella Stuart]].  Amongst others, they approached [[Henry IV of France]] for funding, but were unsuccessful.  All those involved in both plots were arrested in July and tried in autumn 1603; [[George Brooke (conspirator)|Sir George Brooke]] was executed, but James, keen not to have too bloody a start to his reign, reprieved Cobham, Grey, and Markham while they were at the scaffold.  Raleigh, who had watched while his colleagues sweated, and who was due to be executed a few days later, was also pardoned.  Arbella Stuart denied any knowledge of the Main Plot.  The two priests, condemned and \"very bloodily handled\", were executed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=32\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThe Catholic community responded to news of these plots with shock. That the Bye Plot had been revealed by Catholics was instrumental in saving them from further persecution, and James was grateful enough to allow pardons for those recusants who sued for them, as well as postponing payment of their fines for a year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=76\u201378}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 February 1604, shortly after he discovered that his wife, Queen Anne, had been sent a [[rosary]] from the pope via one of James's spies,{{efn|Historians are divided on when and if Anne converted to Catholicism.  \"Some time in the 1590s, Anne became a Roman Catholic.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Willson|1963|p=95}}</ref>  \"Some time after 1600, but well before March 1603, Queen Anne was received into the Catholic Church in a secret chamber in the royal palace\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=15}}</ref> \"...

Some Members of Parliament made it clear that in their view, the \"effluxion of people from the Northern parts\" was unwelcome, and compared them to \"plants which are transported from barren ground into a more fertile one\".  Even more discontent resulted when the King allowed his Scottish nobles to collect the recusancy fines.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=103\u2013106}}</ref>  There were 5,560&nbsp;convicted of recusancy in 1605, of whom 112&nbsp;were landowners.<ref>{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=8}}</ref>  The very few Catholics of great wealth who refused to attend services at their parish church were fined \u00a320 per month.

He also spoke of a Christian union and reiterated his desire to avoid religious persecution.  For the Catholics, the King's speech made it clear that they were not to \"increase their number and strength in this Kingdom\", that \"they might be in hope to erect their Religion again\".  To [[John Gerard (Jesuit)|Father John Gerard]], these words were almost certainly responsible for the heightened levels of persecution the members of his faith now suffered, and for the priest [[Oswald Tesimond]] they were a rebuttal<!--not repudiation?--> of the early claims that the King had made, upon which the papists had built their hopes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref>  A week after James's speech, [[Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|Lord Sheffield]] informed the king of over 900&nbsp;recusants brought before the [[Assizes]] in Normanby, and on 24 April a [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] was introduced in Parliament which threatened to outlaw all English followers of the Catholic Church.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=108}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Eliz bohemia 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Painting|King James's daughter Elizabeth, whom the conspirators planned to install on the throne as a Catholic queen.

The senior judges of the English legal system, most of the Protestant aristocracy, and the bishops of the [[Church of England]] would all have attended in their capacity as members of the House of Lords, along with the members of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=46}}</ref>  Another important objective was the kidnapping of the King's daughter, Elizabeth.  Housed at [[Coombe Abbey]] near [[Coventry]], she lived only ten miles north of Warwick\u2014convenient for the plotters, most of whom lived in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]].  Once the King and his Parliament were dead, the plotters intended to install Elizabeth on the English throne as a titular Queen.  The fate of her brothers, Henry and Charles, would be improvised; their role in state ceremonies was, as yet, uncertain.  The plotters planned to use [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland]], as Elizabeth's [[regent]], but most likely never informed him of this.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=140\u2013142}}</ref>\n\n===Initial recruitment===\n[[Robert Catesby]] (1573\u20131605), a man of \"ancient, historic and distinguished lineage\", was the inspiration behind the plot.  He was described by contemporaries as \"a good-looking man, about six feet tall, athletic and a good swordsman\".  Along with several other conspirators, he took part in the [[Essex Rebellion]] in 1601, during which he was wounded and captured.  Queen Elizabeth allowed him to escape with his life after fining him 4,000&nbsp;[[Mark (money)#England and Scotland|marks]] (equivalent to more than \u00a36&nbsp;million in 2008), after which he sold his estate in [[Chastleton]].{{efn|Comparing relative average earnings of \u00a33,000 in 1601 with 2008.}}<ref name=MeasuringWorth /><ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=47}}</ref><ref name=\"NorthcotePP44-46\" />  In 1603 Catesby helped to organise a mission to the new king of Spain, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], urging Philip to launch an invasion attempt on England, which they assured him would be well supported, particularly by the English Catholics.  [[Robert and Thomas Wintour|Thomas Wintour]] (1571\u20131606) was chosen as the emissary, but the Spanish king, although sympathetic to the plight of Catholics in England, was intent on making peace with James.<ref>{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=45\u201346}}</ref>  Wintour had also attempted to convince the Spanish envoy Don Juan de Tassis that \"3,000 Catholics\" were ready and waiting to support such an invasion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=93}}</ref>  Concern was voiced by [[Pope Clement VIII]] that using violence to achieve a restoration of Catholic power in England would result in the destruction of those that remained.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=90}}</ref>\n\nAccording to contemporary accounts,{{efn|Some of the information in these accounts would have been given under pain or threat of torture, and may also have been subject to government interference, and should therefore be viewed with caution.}} in February 1604 Catesby invited Thomas Wintour to his house in [[Lambeth]], where they discussed Catesby's plan to re-establish Catholicism in England by blowing up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament.<ref name=\"NorthcotePP44-46\" />   Wintour was known as a competent scholar, able to speak several languages, and he had fought with the English army in the Netherlands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=50}}</ref>  His uncle, [[Francis Ingleby]], had been executed for being a Catholic priest in 1586, and Wintour later converted to Catholicism.<ref name=\"Fraserpp5961\"/>  Also present at the meeting was [[John and Christopher Wright|John Wright]], a devout Catholic said to be one of the best swordsmen of his day, and a man who had taken part with Catesby in the Earl of Essex's rebellion three years earlier.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=58}}</ref>  Despite his reservations over the possible repercussions should the attempt fail, Wintour agreed to join the conspiracy, perhaps persuaded by Catesby's rhetoric: \"Let us give the attempt and where it faileth, pass no further.\"<ref name=\"NorthcotePP44-46\">{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=44\u201346}}</ref>\n\nWintour travelled to Flanders to enquire about Spanish support.

Percy returned with promises of support for the Catholics,<!-- At the same time James was making similar noises to the Puritans p51 --> and Northumberland believed that James would go so far as to allow Mass in private houses, so as not to cause public offence.

The adjournment of Parliament gave them, they thought, until February 1605 to finalise their plans.  On 9 June, Percy's patron, the Earl of Northumberland, appointed him to the [[Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms]], a [[cavalry|mounted troop]] of 50&nbsp;bodyguards to the King. This role gave Percy reason to seek a base in London, and a small property near the Prince's Chamber owned by Henry Ferrers, a tenant of John Whynniard, was chosen.  Percy arranged for the use of the house through Northumberland's agents, [[Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester|Dudley Carleton]] and [[John Hippisley (Parliamentarian)|John Hippisley]].

The contemporaneous account of the prosecution claimed that during this delay the conspirators were digging a tunnel beneath Parliament.  This may have been a government fabrication, as no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found.  The account of a tunnel comes directly from Thomas Wintour's confession,<ref name=\"ODNB Thomas Wintour\"/> and Guy Fawkes did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation.  Logistically, digging a tunnel would have proved extremely difficult, especially as none of the conspirators had any experience of mining.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=133\u2013134}}</ref>  If the story is true, by 6 December the Scottish commissioners had finished their work, and the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords.  They ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above.

The additions of Wintour and Wright were obvious choices.  Along with a small fortune, Robert Wintour inherited [[Huddington Court]] (a known refuge for priests) near [[Worcester]], and was reputedly a generous and well-liked man.

The [[Palace of Westminster]] in the early 17th century was a warren of buildings clustered around the medieval chambers, chapels, and halls of the former royal palace that housed both Parliament and the various royal law courts.  The old palace was easily accessible; merchants, lawyers, and others lived and worked in the lodgings, shops and taverns within its precincts.  Whynniard's building was along a right-angle to the House of Lords, alongside a passageway called Parliament Place, which itself led to Parliament Stairs and the [[River Thames]]. Undercrofts were common features at the time, used to house a variety of materials including food and firewood. Whynniard's undercroft, on the ground floor, was directly beneath the first-floor House of Lords, and may once have been part of the palace's medieval kitchen.  Unused and filthy, its location was ideal for what the group planned to do.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=144\u2013145}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Capon map of parliament.jpg|left|thumb|250px|alt=The medieval complex of Parliamentary buildings was mapped by William Capon around the turn of the 18th century.

Garnet answered that such actions could often be excused, but according to his own account later admonished Catesby during a second meeting in July in Essex, showing him a letter from the pope which forbade rebellion.  Soon after, the Jesuit priest [[Oswald Tesimond]] told Garnet he had taken Catesby's confession,{{efn|Haynes (2005) writes that Tesimond took Thomas Bates' confession.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=62}}</ref>}} in the course of which he had learnt of the plot.

Fawkes left the country for a short time. The King, meanwhile, spent much of the summer away from the city, hunting.  He stayed wherever was convenient, including on occasion at the houses of prominent Catholics.  Garnet, convinced that the threat of an uprising had receded, travelled the country on a [[pilgrimage]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=159\u2013162}}</ref>\n\nIt is uncertain when Fawkes returned to England, but he was back in London by late August, when he and Wintour discovered that the gunpowder stored in the undercroft had decayed.  More gunpowder was brought into the room, along with firewood to conceal it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=170}}</ref>  The final three conspirators were recruited in late 1605.  At [[Michaelmas]], Catesby persuaded the staunchly Catholic [[Ambrose Rookwood]] to rent [[Clopton House]] near Stratford-upon-Avon.  Rookwood was a young man with recusant connections, whose stable of horses at [[Coldham Hall]] in [[Stanningfield]], [[Suffolk]] was an important factor in his enlistment.  His parents, [[Robert Rookwood]] and [[Dorothea Drury]], were wealthy landowners, and had educated their son at a Jesuit school near [[Calais]].  [[Everard Digby]] was a young man who was generally well liked, and lived at [[Gayhurst House, Buckinghamshire|Gayhurst House]] in [[Buckinghamshire]].  He had been knighted by the King in April 1603, and was converted to Catholicism by Gerard.  Digby and his wife, [[Mary Mulshaw]], had accompanied the priest on his pilgrimage, and the two men were reportedly close friends.  Digby was asked by Catesby to rent [[Coughton Court]] near [[Alcester]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=159\u2013162, 168\u2013169}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=175\u2013176}}</ref>  Digby also promised \u00a31,500 after Percy failed to pay the rent due for the properties he had taken in Westminster.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=80}}</ref>  Finally, on 14 October Catesby invited [[Francis Tresham]] into the conspiracy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=171\u2013173}}</ref>  Tresham was the son of the Catholic [[Thomas Tresham II|Thomas Tresham]], and a cousin to Robert Catesby\u2014the two had been raised together.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=110}}</ref>  He was also the heir to his father's large fortune, which had been depleted by recusant fines, expensive tastes, and by Francis and Catesby's involvement in the Essex revolt.{{efn|Thomas Tresham had paid Francis's fine in full and part of Catesby's fine.}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=79\u201380, 110}}</ref>\n\nCatesby and Tresham met at the home of Tresham's brother-in-law and cousin, [[Edward Stourton, 10th Baron Stourton|Lord Stourton]].  In his confession, Tresham claimed that he had asked Catesby if the plot would damn their souls, to which Catesby had replied it would not, and that the plight of England's Catholics required that it be done.  Catesby also apparently asked for \u00a32,000, and the use of [[Rushton Hall]] in [[Northamptonshire]].  Tresham declined both offers (although he did give \u00a3100 to Thomas Wintour), and told his interrogators that he had moved his family from Rushton to London in advance of the plot; hardly the actions of a guilty man, he claimed.<!-- guilty of concealment but not an active participant --><ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=173\u2013175}}</ref>\n\n===Monteagle letter===\n[[File:Monteagle letter.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|alt=A damaged and aged piece of paper, or parchment, with multiple lines of handwritten English text.|An anonymous letter, sent to William Parker, {{nowrap|4th Baron Monteagle}}, was instrumental in revealing the plot's existence.

From there they continued their journey to Huddington.  Bates left the group and travelled to [[Coughton Court]] to deliver a letter from Catesby, to Father Garnet and the other priests, informing them of what had transpired, and asking for their help in raising an army.  Garnet replied by begging Catesby and his followers to stop their \"wicked actions\", before himself fleeing.  Several priests set out for Warwick, worried about the fate of their colleagues.  They were caught, and then imprisoned in London.  Catesby and the others arrived at Huddington early in the afternoon, and were met by Thomas Wintour.

Bates had been present at most of the conspirators' meetings, and under interrogation he implicated Father Tesimond in the plot.  On 13 January 1606 he described how he had visited Garnet and Tesimond on 7 November to inform Garnet of the plot's failure.  Bates also told his interrogators of his ride with Tesimond to Huddington, before the priest left him to head for the Habingtons at Hindlip Hall, and of a meeting between Garnet, Gerard, and Tesimond in October 1605.  At about the same time in December, Tresham's health began to deteriorate.  He was visited regularly by his wife, a nurse, and his servant William Vavasour, who documented his [[strangury]].  Before he died Tresham had also told of Garnet's involvement with the 1603 mission to Spain, but in his last hours he retracted some of these statements.  Nowhere in his confession did he mention the Monteagle letter.  He died early on the morning of 23 December, and was buried in the Tower.

In ''What If the Gunpowder Plot Had Succeeded?'' historian [[Ronald Hutton]] considered the events which might have followed a successful implementation of the plot, and the destruction of the House of Lords and all those within it.  He concluded that a severe backlash against suspected Catholics would have followed, and that without foreign assistance a successful rebellion would have been unlikely; despite differing religious convictions, most Englishmen were loyal to the institution of the monarchy.  England might have become a more \"Puritan absolute monarchy\", as \"existed in Sweden, Denmark, [[Saxony]], and [[Prussia]] in the seventeenth century\", rather than following the path of parliamentary and civil reform that it did.<ref name=\"hutton\">{{citation | last=Hutton | first=Ronald | title=What If the Gunpowder Plot Had Succeeded? | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/gunpowder_hutton_01.shtml | publisher=bbc.co.uk | date=1 April 2001 | accessdate=7 November 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109062537/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/gunpowder_hutton_01.shtml | archive-date=9 January 2009 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Accusations of state conspiracy===\nMany at the time felt that Salisbury had been involved in the plot to gain favour with the King and enact more stridently anti-Catholic legislation.

The experiment was conducted on the [[Advantica (UK)|Advantica]]-owned [[RAF Spadeadam|Spadeadam test site]] and demonstrated that the explosion, if the gunpowder was in good order, would have killed all those in the building.<ref name=Times>{{citation | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article584830.ece | title = Gunpowder plotters get their wish, 400 years on | last = Sherwin | first = Adam | publisher = timesonline.co.uk | date = 31 October 2005 | accessdate = 18 January 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604000218/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article584830.ece | archive-date = 4 June 2011 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The power of the explosion was such that of the {{convert|7|ft|adj=on}} deep concrete walls making up the undercroft (replicating how archives suggest the walls of the old House of Lords were constructed), the end wall where the barrels were placed by, under the throne, was reduced to rubble, and the adjacent surviving portions of wall were shoved away. Measuring devices placed in the chamber to calculate the force of the blast were recorded as going off the scale just before their destruction by the explosion; a piece of the head of the dummy representing King James, which had been placed on a throne inside the chamber surrounded by courtiers, peers and bishops, was found a considerable distance from its initial location. According to the findings of the programme, no one within {{convert|330|ft}} of the blast could have survived, and all of the stained glass windows in [[Westminster Abbey]] would have been shattered, as would all of the windows in the vicinity of the Palace. The explosion would have been seen from miles away and heard from further away still. Even if only half of the gunpowder had gone off, which Fawkes was apparently prepared for, everyone in the House of Lords and its environs would have been killed instantly.<ref name=Times/>\n\nThe programme also disproved claims that some deterioration in the quality of the gunpowder would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in a heap and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating for the quality of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up from the top of the barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed double the amount needed. In a test detonation of all {{convert|12|kg}} of period-accurate gunpowder available in the UK inside the same size of barrel Fawkes had used, the experts for the project were surprised at how much more powerful an effect that compression had in creating an explosion.<ref>{{citation | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1501865/Guy-Fawkes-had-twice-the-gunpowder-needed.html | title = Guy Fawkes had twice the gunpowder needed | first = Fiona | last = Govan | publisher = telegraph.co.uk | date = 31 October 2005 | accessdate = 18 January 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120523012931/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1501865/Guy-Fawkes-had-twice-the-gunpowder-needed.html | archive-date = 23 May 2012 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSome of the gunpowder guarded by Fawkes may have survived.

Catesby may have embarked on the scheme after hopes of securing greater religious tolerance under [[James VI and I |King James]] had faded, leaving many English Catholics disappointed. His fellow plotters were [[John and Christopher Wright]], [[Robert and Thomas Wintour]], [[Thomas Percy (Gunpowder Plot)|Thomas Percy]], [[Guy Fawkes]], [[Robert Keyes]], [[Thomas Bates]], [[John Grant (Gunpowder Plot)|John Grant]], [[Ambrose Rookwood]], Sir [[Everard Digby]] and [[Francis Tresham]].  Fawkes, who had 10&nbsp;years of military experience fighting in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in the failed suppression of the [[Dutch Revolt]], was given charge of the explosives.\n\nThe plot was revealed to the authorities in an anonymous letter sent to [[William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle]], on 26 October 1605. During a search of the House of Lords in the evening on 4 November 1605, Fawkes was discovered guarding 36&nbsp;barrels of [[gunpowder]]\u2014enough to reduce the House of Lords to rubble\u2014and arrested. Most of the conspirators fled from London as they learned of the plot's discovery, trying to enlist support along the way. Several made a stand against the pursuing Sheriff of Worcester and his men at [[Holbeche House]]; in the ensuing battle, Catesby was one of those shot and killed. At their trial on 27 January 1606, eight of the survivors, including Fawkes, were convicted and sentenced to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]].\n\nDetails of the assassination attempt were allegedly known by the principal [[Jesuit]] of England, Father [[Henry Garnet]]. Although he was convicted of [[treason]] and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through [[Confession (religion)#Roman Catholicism|confession]], Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the [[Seal of the Confessional in the Catholic Church|absolute confidentiality of the confessional]]. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during [[James VI and I|King James's]] reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as the ringing of church bells, which have evolved into the [[Guy Fawkes Night|Bonfire Night]] of today.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Religion in England===\n{{Main|English Reformation}}\n{{See also|Catholic Church in England and Wales}}\n[[File:Elizabeth I George Gower.jpg|thumb|alt=A three-quarter portrait of a middle-aged woman wearing a tiara, bodice, puffed-out sleeves, and a lace ruff.

English Catholics struggled in a society dominated by the newly separate and increasingly [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Church of England]].  Henry's daughter, [[Queen Elizabeth I]], responded to the growing religious divide by introducing the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], which required anyone appointed to a public or church office to swear allegiance to the monarch as head of the Church and state. The penalties for refusal were severe; fines were imposed for [[recusancy]], and repeat offenders risked imprisonment and execution.  Catholicism became marginalised, but despite the threat of torture or execution, priests continued to practise their faith in secret.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=12}}</ref>\n\n===Succession===\nQueen Elizabeth, unmarried and childless, steadfastly refused to name an heir. Many Catholics believed that her Catholic cousin, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], was the legitimate heir to the English throne, but she was executed for treason in 1587.  The [[English Secretary of State]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], negotiated secretly with Mary's son and successor, King [[James VI of Scotland]]. In the months before Elizabeth's death on 24 March 1603, Cecil prepared the way for James to succeed her.{{efn|Salisbury wrote to James, \"The subject itself is so perilous to touch amongst us as it setteth a mark upon his head forever that hatcheth such a bird\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Willson|1963|p=154}}</ref>}}\n\nSome exiled Catholics favoured [[Philip II of Spain]]'s daughter, [[Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella]], as Elizabeth's successor.  More moderate Catholics looked to James's and Elizabeth's cousin [[Arbella Stuart]], a woman thought to have Catholic sympathies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=15}}</ref>  As Elizabeth's health deteriorated, the government detained those they considered to be the \"principal papists\",<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=xxv\u2013xxvi}}</ref> and the [[Privy Council]] grew so worried that Arbella Stuart was moved closer to [[London]] to prevent her from being kidnapped by [[papist]]s.<ref name=\"Fraserpxxv\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=xxv}}</ref>\n\nDespite competing claims to the English throne, the transition of power following Elizabeth's death went smoothly.{{efn|The [[heir presumptive]] under the terms of [[Henry VIII's will]], i.e. either [[Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp]], or [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven]], depending on whether one recognised the legitimacy of the first-mentioned's birth; and  the Lady [[Arbella Stuart]] on grounds similar to James's own.}}  James's succession was announced by a proclamation from Cecil on 24 March, which was generally celebrated.  Leading papists, rather than causing trouble as anticipated, reacted to the news by offering their enthusiastic support for the new monarch.  [[Jesuit]] priests, whose presence in England was punishable by death, also demonstrated their support for James, who was widely believed to embody \"the natural order of things\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=xxvii\u2013xxix}}</ref>  James ordered a ceasefire in the conflict with Spain, and even though the two countries were still technically at war, [[Philip III of Spain|King Philip III]] sent his envoy, [[Juan de Tassis y Peralta, 2nd Count of Villamediana|Don Juan de Tassis]], to congratulate James on his accession.<ref name=\"Fraserp91\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=91}}</ref><!-- James and Tassis first met 8 November, Fraser p94 --> In the following year both countries signed the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]]. \n\nFor decades, the English had lived under a monarch who refused to provide an heir, but James arrived with a family and a clear line of succession.

In what became known as the [[Bye Plot]], the priests [[William Watson (priest)|William Watson]] and [[William Clark (priest)|William Clark]] planned to kidnap James and hold him in the Tower of London until he agreed to be more tolerant towards Catholics. Cecil received news of the plot from several sources, including the [[Archpriest]] [[George Blackwell]], who instructed his priests to have no part in any such schemes. At about the same time, [[Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham|Lord Cobham]], [[Thomas Grey, 15th Baron Grey de Wilton|Lord Grey de Wilton]], [[Griffin Markham]] and [[Walter Raleigh]] hatched what became known as the [[Main Plot]], which involved removing James and his family and supplanting them with [[Arbella Stuart]].  Amongst others, they approached [[Henry IV of France]] for funding, but were unsuccessful.  All those involved in both plots were arrested in July and tried in autumn 1603; [[George Brooke (conspirator)|Sir George Brooke]] was executed, but James, keen not to have too bloody a start to his reign, reprieved Cobham, Grey, and Markham while they were at the scaffold.  Raleigh, who had watched while his colleagues sweated, and who was due to be executed a few days later, was also pardoned.  Arbella Stuart denied any knowledge of the Main Plot.  The two priests, condemned and \"very bloodily handled\", were executed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|pp=32\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThe Catholic community responded to news of these plots with shock. That the Bye Plot had been revealed by Catholics was instrumental in saving them from further persecution, and James was grateful enough to allow pardons for those recusants who sued for them, as well as postponing payment of their fines for a year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=76\u201378}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 February 1604, shortly after he discovered that his wife, Queen Anne, had been sent a [[rosary]] from the pope via one of James's spies,{{efn|Historians are divided on when and if Anne converted to Catholicism.  \"Some time in the 1590s, Anne became a Roman Catholic.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Willson|1963|p=95}}</ref>  \"Some time after 1600, but well before March 1603, Queen Anne was received into the Catholic Church in a secret chamber in the royal palace\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=15}}</ref> \"...

He also spoke of a Christian union and reiterated his desire to avoid religious persecution.  For the Catholics, the King's speech made it clear that they were not to \"increase their number and strength in this Kingdom\", that \"they might be in hope to erect their Religion again\".  To [[John Gerard (Jesuit)|Father John Gerard]], these words were almost certainly responsible for the heightened levels of persecution the members of his faith now suffered, and for the priest [[Oswald Tesimond]] they were a rebuttal<!--not repudiation?--> of the early claims that the King had made, upon which the papists had built their hopes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref>  A week after James's speech, [[Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|Lord Sheffield]] informed the king of over 900&nbsp;recusants brought before the [[Assizes]] in Normanby, and on 24 April a [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] was introduced in Parliament which threatened to outlaw all English followers of the Catholic Church.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=108}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Eliz bohemia 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Painting|King James's daughter Elizabeth, whom the conspirators planned to install on the throne as a Catholic queen.

Once the King and his Parliament were dead, the plotters intended to install Elizabeth on the English throne as a titular Queen.

Along with several other conspirators, he took part in the [[Essex Rebellion]] in 1601, during which he was wounded and captured.  Queen Elizabeth allowed him to escape with his life after fining him 4,000&nbsp;[[Mark (money)#England and Scotland|marks]] (equivalent to more than \u00a36&nbsp;million in 2008), after which he sold his estate in [[Chastleton]].{{efn|Comparing relative average earnings of \u00a33,000 in 1601 with 2008.}}<ref name=MeasuringWorth /><ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=47}}</ref><ref name=\"NorthcotePP44-46\" />  In 1603 Catesby helped to organise a mission to the new king of Spain, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], urging Philip to launch an invasion attempt on England, which they assured him would be well supported, particularly by the English Catholics.

Percy returned with promises of support for the Catholics,<!-- At the same time James was making similar noises to the Puritans p51 --> and Northumberland believed that James would go so far as to allow Mass in private houses, so as not to cause public offence.

The adjournment of Parliament gave them, they thought, until February 1605 to finalise their plans.  On 9 June, Percy's patron, the Earl of Northumberland, appointed him to the [[Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms]], a [[cavalry|mounted troop]] of 50&nbsp;bodyguards to the King. This role gave Percy reason to seek a base in London, and a small property near the Prince's Chamber owned by Henry Ferrers, a tenant of John Whynniard, was chosen.  Percy arranged for the use of the house through Northumberland's agents, [[Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester|Dudley Carleton]] and [[John Hippisley (Parliamentarian)|John Hippisley]].

Concern over the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] meant that rather than sitting in February, as the plotters had originally planned for, Parliament would not sit again until 3 October 1605.  The contemporaneous account of the prosecution claimed that during this delay the conspirators were digging a tunnel beneath Parliament.  This may have been a government fabrication, as no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found.  The account of a tunnel comes directly from Thomas Wintour's confession,<ref name=\"ODNB Thomas Wintour\"/> and Guy Fawkes did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation.  Logistically, digging a tunnel would have proved extremely difficult, especially as none of the conspirators had any experience of mining.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=133\u2013134}}</ref>  If the story is true, by 6 December the Scottish commissioners had finished their work, and the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords.  They ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above.

The [[Palace of Westminster]] in the early 17th century was a warren of buildings clustered around the medieval chambers, chapels, and halls of the former royal palace that housed both Parliament and the various royal law courts.  The old palace was easily accessible; merchants, lawyers, and others lived and worked in the lodgings, shops and taverns within its precincts.  Whynniard's building was along a right-angle to the House of Lords, alongside a passageway called Parliament Place, which itself led to Parliament Stairs and the [[River Thames]]. Undercrofts were common features at the time, used to house a variety of materials including food and firewood. Whynniard's undercroft, on the ground floor, was directly beneath the first-floor House of Lords, and may once have been part of the palace's medieval kitchen.  Unused and filthy, its location was ideal for what the group planned to do.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=144\u2013145}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Capon map of parliament.jpg|left|thumb|250px|alt=The medieval complex of Parliamentary buildings was mapped by William Capon around the turn of the 18th century.

Soon after, the Jesuit priest [[Oswald Tesimond]] told Garnet he had taken Catesby's confession,{{efn|Haynes (2005) writes that Tesimond took Thomas Bates' confession.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haynes|2005|p=62}}</ref>}} in the course of which he had learnt of the plot.

Fawkes left the country for a short time. The King, meanwhile, spent much of the summer away from the city, hunting.  He stayed wherever was convenient, including on occasion at the houses of prominent Catholics.

[[Everard Digby]] was a young man who was generally well liked, and lived at [[Gayhurst House, Buckinghamshire|Gayhurst House]] in [[Buckinghamshire]].  He had been knighted by the King in April 1603, and was converted to Catholicism by Gerard.  Digby and his wife, [[Mary Mulshaw]], had accompanied the priest on his pilgrimage, and the two men were reportedly close friends.

Catesby also apparently asked for \u00a32,000, and the use of [[Rushton Hall]] in [[Northamptonshire]].  Tresham declined both offers (although he did give \u00a3100 to Thomas Wintour), and told his interrogators that he had moved his family from Rushton to London in advance of the plot; hardly the actions of a guilty man, he claimed.<!-- guilty of concealment but not an active participant --><ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=173\u2013175}}</ref>\n\n===Monteagle letter===\n[[File:Monteagle letter.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|alt=A damaged and aged piece of paper, or parchment, with multiple lines of handwritten English text.|An anonymous letter, sent to William Parker, {{nowrap|4th Baron Monteagle}}, was instrumental in revealing the plot's existence.

From there they continued their journey to Huddington.  Bates left the group and travelled to [[Coughton Court]] to deliver a letter from Catesby, to Father Garnet and the other priests, informing them of what had transpired, and asking for their help in raising an army.  Garnet replied by begging Catesby and his followers to stop their \"wicked actions\", before himself fleeing.  Several priests set out for Warwick, worried about the fate of their colleagues.  They were caught, and then imprisoned in London.  Catesby and the others arrived at Huddington early in the afternoon, and were met by Thomas Wintour.  They received practically no support or sympathy from those they met, including family members, who were terrified at the prospect of being associated with treason.  They continued on to [[Holbeche House]] on the border of [[Staffordshire]], the home of Stephen Littleton, a member of their ever-decreasing band of followers. Whilst there Stephen Littleton and Thomas Wintour went to 'Pepperhill', the Shropshire residence of [[John Talbot of Grafton|Sir John Talbot]] to gain support but to no avail. Tired and desperate, they spread out some of the now-soaked gunpowder in front of the fire, to dry out.  Although gunpowder does not explode unless physically contained, a spark from the fire landed on the powder and the resultant flames engulfed Catesby, Rookwood, Grant, and a man named Morgan (a member of the hunting party).<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=218\u2013222}}</ref>\n\nThomas Wintour and Littleton, on their way from Huddington to Holbeche House, were told by a messenger that Catesby had died.

In the foreground, assorted building materials are visible. In the background, a hillside is partially covered by a forest.|A photograph of the explosion, moments after detonation]]\nIn the 2005 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] programme ''[[The Gunpowder Plot: Exploding The Legend]]'', a full-size replica of the House of Lords was built and destroyed with barrels of gunpowder, totalling 1 [[metric tonne]] of explosives. The experiment was conducted on the [[Advantica (UK)|Advantica]]-owned [[RAF Spadeadam|Spadeadam test site]] and demonstrated that the explosion, if the gunpowder was in good order, would have killed all those in the building.<ref name=Times>{{citation | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article584830.ece | title = Gunpowder plotters get their wish, 400 years on | last = Sherwin | first = Adam | publisher = timesonline.co.uk | date = 31 October 2005 | accessdate = 18 January 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604000218/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article584830.ece | archive-date = 4 June 2011 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The power of the explosion was such that of the {{convert|7|ft|adj=on}} deep concrete walls making up the undercroft (replicating how archives suggest the walls of the old House of Lords were constructed), the end wall where the barrels were placed by, under the throne, was reduced to rubble, and the adjacent surviving portions of wall were shoved away. Measuring devices placed in the chamber to calculate the force of the blast were recorded as going off the scale just before their destruction by the explosion; a piece of the head of the dummy representing King James, which had been placed on a throne inside the chamber surrounded by courtiers, peers and bishops, was found a considerable distance from its initial location. According to the findings of the programme, no one within {{convert|330|ft}} of the blast could have survived, and all of the stained glass windows in [[Westminster Abbey]] would have been shattered, as would all of the windows in the vicinity of the Palace. The explosion would have been seen from miles away and heard from further away still. Even if only half of the gunpowder had gone off, which Fawkes was apparently prepared for, everyone in the House of Lords and its environs would have been killed instantly.<ref name=Times/>\n\nThe programme also disproved claims that some deterioration in the quality of the gunpowder would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in a heap and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating for the quality of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up from the top of the barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed double the amount needed. In a test detonation of all {{convert|12|kg}} of period-accurate gunpowder available in the UK inside the same size of barrel Fawkes had used, the experts for the project were surprised at how much more powerful an effect that compression had in creating an explosion.<ref>{{citation | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1501865/Guy-Fawkes-had-twice-the-gunpowder-needed.html | title = Guy Fawkes had twice the gunpowder needed | first = Fiona | last = Govan | publisher = telegraph.co.uk | date = 31 October 2005 | accessdate = 18 January 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120523012931/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1501865/Guy-Fawkes-had-twice-the-gunpowder-needed.html | archive-date = 23 May 2012 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSome of the gunpowder guarded by Fawkes may have survived. In March 2002 workers cataloguing archives of diarist [[John Evelyn]] at the [[British Library]] found a box containing a number of gunpowder samples, including a compressed bar with a note in Evelyn's handwriting stating that it had belonged to Guy Fawkes.
