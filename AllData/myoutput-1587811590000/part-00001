{"title_page": "Spanish conquest of Nicaragua", "text_new": "{{History of Nicaragua}}\nThe '''Spanish conquest of Nicaragua''' was the campaign undertaken by the Spanish ''[[conquistador]]es'' against the [[indigenous peoples of Nicaragua|natives]] of the territory now incorporated into the modern [[Central America]]n republic of [[Nicaragua]] during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonisation of the Americas]]. Before European contact in the early 16th century, Nicargua was inhabited by a number of indigenous peoples. In the west, these included Mesoamerican groups such as the [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]], the [[Nicarao people|Nicarao]], and the [[Subtiaba people|Subtiaba]]. Other groups included the [[Matagalpa people|Matagalpa]] and the [[Tacacho people|Tacacho]].\n\n[[Gil Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila]] first entered what is now Nicaragua in 1522, with the permission of [[Pedrarias D\u00e1vila]], governor of [[Castilla de Oro]] (modern [[Panama]]) but was driven back to his ships by the Chorotega. In 1524, a new expedition led by [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (founder of Nicaragua)|Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]] founded the Spanish towns of [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]] and [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]]. The western portions of Nicaragua along the Pacific littoral plain received the brunt of the Spanish activity in the territory for the next three decades.<ref>Ibarra Rojas 1994, p. 231.</ref> Within a century of the conquest, the native inhabitants had been all but eliminated due to war, disease, and exportation as slaves.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Nicaragua CIA map.gif|thumb|right|Map of Nicaragua]]\nNicaragua is the largest country in Central America, covering an area of {{convert|129494|km2|sqmi}} \u2013 or {{convert|120254|km2|sqmi}} without including the surface area of its two largest lakes. The country is bordered to the north by [[Honduras]], and to the south by [[Costa Rica]]; it is bordered to the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and to the east by the [[Caribbean Sea]].<ref name=\"Merril1993a\">Merril 1993a.</ref> Nicaragua is divided into three broad regions, the Pacific Lowlands in the west, the Central Highlands, and the Caribbean Lowlands in the east.<ref name=\"Newson1982p261\">Newson 1982, p. 261.</ref> The Pacific lowlands are largely a coastal plain extending approximately {{convert|75|km|mi}} inland from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. A chain of volcanoes extends from the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] southeast towards Lake Nicaragua; many of them are active. The volcanoes lie along the western edge of a [[rift valley]] running southeast from the Gulf to the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]], which forms a part of the border with Costa Rica. The two largest lakes in Central America dominate the rift valley: [[Lake Managua]] and [[Lake Nicaragua]]. Lake Managua measures {{convert|56|by|24|km|mi}}, and Lake Nicaragua measures {{convert|160|by|75|km|mi}}. The [[Tipitapa River]] flows south out of Lake Managua and into Lake Nicaragua, which empties into the Caribbean via the San Juan River.<ref name=\"Merril1993a\"/> The Central Highlands reach altitudes of up to {{convert|2000|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level]], and consist of generally east-west running ranges that include the [[Cordillera Dariense]], [[Cordillera Dipilto and Jalapa Natural Reserve|Cordillera de Dipilto]], [[Cordillera Isabelia|Cordillera Isabella]], the [[Huap\u00ed Mountains]], and the [[Yolaina Natural Reserve|Yolaina Mountains]].<ref name=\"IbarraRojas1994p234\">Ibarra Rojas 1994, p. 234.</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nIn central Nicaragua, the temperature varies between {{convert|20|and|25|C|F}}; rainfall averages {{convert|1000|to|2000|mm|in}} per year. There is a four-month dry season, with the rain season lasting throughout the rest of the year. Before the conquest, the Central Highlands were covered with [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|coniferous forest]].<ref name=\"IbarraRojas1994p234\"/> The Pacific coastal plain is classified as [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry forest]], and features fertile volcanic soils. The Atlantic lowlands receive higher rainfall; the soils are less fertile, and the region is classified as [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist forest]].<ref name=\"Salamanca2012p7\">Salamanca 2012, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Nicaragua before the conquest==\nWhen the Spanish first arrived in what is now Nicaragua there were three principal indigenous groups living in the western portions of the country; these were the [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]] (also known as the Mangue),<ref name=\"Fowler1985p38\"/> the [[Nicarao people|Nicarao]], and the [[Matagalpa people|Matagalpa]] (also known as Chontal, from the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] term for \"foreigner\").<ref>Staten 2010, pp. 14\u201315. Ibarra Rojas 1994, p. 233.</ref> The Nicarao were a [[Nahuat]]-speaking [[Mesoamerica]]n people that had migrated southwards from central Mexico from the 8th century AD onwards. They broke off from the [[Pipil people|Pipil]] around the early 13th century and settled in pockets of western Nicaragua along the Pacific coast, with their heaviest concentration in what is now the [[Departments of Nicaragua|department]] of [[Rivas Department|Rivas]].<ref>Fowler 1985, pp. 37\u201338.</ref> The Chorotega were also a Mesoamerican people that had migrated from Mexico. The [[Subtiaba people|Subtiaba]] (also known as the Maribio) were another group of Mexican origin. The [[Tacacho people|Tacacho]] were a small group of unknown origin and language.<ref name=\"Fowler1985p38\">Fowler 1985, p. 38.</ref> The Matagalpa were a non-Mesoamerican people of the [[Intermediate Area]], belonging to the [[Chibchan languages|Chibchoidean]] cultural region.<ref>Ibarra Rojas 1994, p. 242.

The first century after Spanish contact witnessed the demographic collapse of the native populations, resulting principally from exposure to [[Old World]] diseases and their exportation as slaves, but also from a combination of war and mistreatment.<ref>Staten 2010, p. 15.</ref> \n99% of the Native population of western [[Nicaragua]] perished over the course of 60 years causing some modern scholars to refer to the Spanish conquest as a [[genocide]] or [[holocaust (disambiguation)|holocaust]].<ref>Grenke 2005, p. 142. Churchill 1999, p. 433.</ref>\n\n===Native weapons and tactics===\nThe Spanish described the Matagalpa as being well-organised, with ordered battle-lines.

Mounted conquistadors were armed with a {{convert|12|ft|m|order=flip|adj=on}} [[lance]], that also served as a [[Pike (weapon)|pike]] for infantrymen. A variety of [[halberd]]s and [[Bill (weapon)|bills]] were also employed. As well as the one-handed broadsword, a {{convert|5.5|ft|m|order=flip|adj=on}} long two-handed version was also used.<ref name=\"Pohl&Hook2008p26\">Pohl and Hook 2008, p. 26.</ref> Crossbows had {{convert|2|ft|m|order=flip|adj=on}} arms stiffened with hardwoods, horn, bone and cane, and supplied with a stirrup to facilitate drawing the string with a crank and pulley.<ref>Pohl and Hook 2008, pp. 26\u201327.</ref> Crossbows were easier to maintain than matchlocks, especially in the humid tropical climate of the Caribbean region.<ref>Pohl and Hook 2008, p. 27.</ref>\n\nMetal armour was of limited use in the hot, wet tropical climate. It was heavy and had to be constantly cleaned to prevent rusting; in direct sunlight, metal armour became unbearably hot. ''Conquistadores'' often went without metal armour, or only donned it immediately prior to battle.<ref>Pohl and Hook 2008, p. 23.</ref> They were quick to adopt quilted cotton armour based upon that used by their native opponents, and commonly combined this with the use of a simple metal [[war hat]].<ref>Pohl and Hook 2008, p. 16, 26.</ref> [[Shield]]s were considered essential by both infantry and cavalry; generally this was a circular target shield, convex in form and fashioned from iron or wood. Rings secured it to the arm and hand.<ref name=\"Pohl&Hook2008p26\"/>\n\n===Role of the Church===\n\nThe justification for conquest was explicitly religious. In 1493, the Spanish [[Pope Alexander VI]] issued the [[Bulls of Donation]] that justified the colonisation of the New World for the express purpose of converting the native inhabitants to Christianity.<ref>Deagan 2003, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> The Spanish Crown and the Church insisted that the conquered peoples were human souls meriting legal rights and protection, while the colonists claimed they were subhuman, and a valid resource for forced labour. These opposing viewpoints led to conflict between the authorities in Spain and the colonists on the ground in the Americas.<ref>Deagan 2003, p. 5.</ref> There was religious participation in the conquest of Nicaragua from the first exploratory expeditions onwards; Father Diego de Ag\u00fcero accompanied Gil Gonz\u00e1lez on his 1519 expedition, and returned with Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba in 1524, with two religious companions.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 78\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 78.</ref> One of the first actions performed upon entering an indigenous settlement was to plant a cross on top of the local shrine, to symbolically replace the native religion with the authority of the Church.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 78\u201379.</ref> Fathers Contreras and Blas Hern\u00e1ndez established the first [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] presence in 1619.<ref>Sariego 2005, p. 12.</ref>\n\n==Discovery of Nicaragua, 1519\u20131523==\nSpanish explorers first viewed the Pacific coast of Nicaragua in 1519, sailing up from Panama.<ref name=\"Stanislawski1983p1\">Stanislawski 1983, p. 1.</ref> That year, [[Pedro Arias D\u00e1vila|Pedrarias D\u00e1vila]] executed N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa and seized his ships on the Pacific coast of Panama.

Here they noticed that the natives had cultural traits more in common with the inhabitants of the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. By this time, Gonz\u00e1lez was weakened by sickness, and wished to continue by sea, but his men demanded he continue the march with them.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p54\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 54.</ref> They used one of the ships to cross to the western shore of the Gulf of Nicoya, where they were received enthusiastically by the natives.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p56\"/> He pushed on overland, with 100 Spaniards and 4 horses.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p54\"/>\n\n===Exploration of the Pacific coast===\nWhile Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila marched overland with his troops, Andr\u00e9s Ni\u00f1o left two of his ships behind and sailed onward with the remaining two.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p55\"/> On 27 February 1523, Ni\u00f1o put to shore at [[El Realejo]], where Captain Ant\u00f3n Mayor formally took possession of the territory in the name of the Spanish crown, the first Spanish act in the territory of what is now Nicaragua.<ref name=\"Calvo Poyato 1988, p. 8\"/> They met no opposition at that time, and the act was officially recorded by Juan de Almanza, who acted as scribe for the legal documentation. To commemorate this act, they named the place Posesi\u00f3n. Ni\u00f1o sailed onwards, making landfall on as island in the Gulf of Fonseca on 5 March, giving the Gulf its name in honour of Spanish bishop [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca]].<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p55\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 55.</ref> Ni\u00f1o continued onwards as far as the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]], in what is now Mexico.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p56\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 56.</ref>\n\n===Expedition inland===\nMeanwhile, on his march inland, Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila heard rumours of a powerful native ruler called [[Nicarao (cacique)|Nicarao]] or Nicargaua, who commanded many warriors. He was advised not to continue, but decided to march on until he met opposition.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 56\u201357.</ref> Nicarao intercepted Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila outside his capital city,<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p57\"/> called [[Quauhcapolca]],<ref name=\"Healy1980,2006p21\">Healy 1980, 2006, p. 21.</ref> and received him in peace. He invited the Spaniards to lodge near the city plaza and the two leaders exchanged gifts; Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila wrote that he received the equivalent of 15,000 gold ''castellanos''. The Spanish captain gifted Nicarao with silk clothing and many other items brought from Spain. Over the course of the next few days, the Spanish instructed the natives in the basics of Christian religion. He claimed that after this, the natives wished to convert to the new religion, and that just over 9000 people were baptised in one day, including adults and children of both genders.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p57\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 57.</ref> After several days in the Nicarao capital, Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila learned of [[Lake Nicaragua]], and he sent a small detachment of soldiers to confirm its existence; he then travelled in person with 15 foot soldiers and 3 mounted soldiers. Among those who went with him to the lakeshore were the expedition's treasurer Andr\u00e9s de Cereceda, and friar Diego de Ag\u00fcero.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 59.</ref>  On 12 April 1523 they claimed the lake for the Spanish Crown under the name of ''Mar Dulce'' (\"sweet sea\").<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 59\u201360.</ref> Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila sent out a canoe to scout the lake for a short distance, and questioned the natives as to whether it connected with the sea, without receiving any clear response; nonetheless, the Spanish were convinced that the lake must have an outlet to the Caribbean Sea, and that they had discovered a new route across the Central American isthmus.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 60\u201361.</ref> A great many natives came to see newly arrived Europeans, driven by curiosity about their strange appearance and mode of dress, and horses, which the natives had never seen before.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p61\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 61.</ref>\n\n===Opposition and retreat===\nFrom Quauhcapolca, Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila advanced to the indigenous settlement of Coatega,<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p61\"/> near the [[Mombacho]] volcano,<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p63\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 63.</ref> where he was met by another powerful ruler, [[Diriangen|Diriang\u00e9n]], leader of the Chorotega.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 61.

He returned on 17 April at midday, arrayed for battle. The Spanish were alerted to the surprise attack by one of the local natives; even so a violent struggle ensued that resulted in the wounding of various Spanish defenders. The use of their small number of horses assisted them, since they struck fear into the enemy. The Chorotega attack was beaten off, and Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila immediately sent messengers to call back an advance party consisting of friar Ag\u00fcero accompanied by a number of soldiers, who had been advancing towards Diriang\u00e9n's territory.

Mounted conquistadors were armed with a {{convert|12|ft|m|order=flip|adj=on}} [[lance]], that also served as a [[Pike (weapon)|pike]] for infantrymen. A variety of [[halberd]]s and [[Bill (weapon)|bills]] were also employed.

It was heavy and had to be constantly cleaned to prevent rusting; in direct sunlight, metal armour became unbearably hot. ''Conquistadores'' often went without metal armour, or only donned it immediately prior to battle.<ref>Pohl and Hook 2008, p. 23.</ref> They were quick to adopt quilted cotton armour based upon that used by their native opponents, and commonly combined this with the use of a simple metal [[war hat]].<ref>Pohl and Hook 2008, p. 16, 26.</ref> [[Shield]]s were considered essential by both infantry and cavalry; generally this was a circular target shield, convex in form and fashioned from iron or wood.

In 1493, the Spanish [[Pope Alexander VI]] issued the [[Bulls of Donation]] that justified the colonisation of the New World for the express purpose of converting the native inhabitants to Christianity.<ref>Deagan 2003, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> The Spanish Crown and the Church insisted that the conquered peoples were human souls meriting legal rights and protection, while the colonists claimed they were subhuman, and a valid resource for forced labour. These opposing viewpoints led to conflict between the authorities in Spain and the colonists on the ground in the Americas.<ref>Deagan 2003, p. 5.</ref> There was religious participation in the conquest of Nicaragua from the first exploratory expeditions onwards; Father Diego de Ag\u00fcero accompanied Gil Gonz\u00e1lez on his 1519 expedition, and returned with Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba in 1524, with two religious companions.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 78\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 78.</ref> One of the first actions performed upon entering an indigenous settlement was to plant a cross on top of the local shrine, to symbolically replace the native religion with the authority of the Church.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 78\u201379.</ref> Fathers Contreras and Blas Hern\u00e1ndez established the first [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] presence in 1619.<ref>Sariego 2005, p. 12.</ref>\n\n==Discovery of Nicaragua, 1519\u20131523==\nSpanish explorers first viewed the Pacific coast of Nicaragua in 1519, sailing up from Panama.<ref name=\"Stanislawski1983p1\">Stanislawski 1983, p. 1.</ref> That year, [[Pedro Arias D\u00e1vila|Pedrarias D\u00e1vila]] executed N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa and seized his ships on the Pacific coast of Panama.

He invited the Spaniards to lodge near the city plaza and the two leaders exchanged gifts; Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila wrote that he received the equivalent of 15,000 gold ''castellanos''. The Spanish captain gifted Nicarao with silk clothing and many other items brought from Spain. Over the course of the next few days, the Spanish instructed the natives in the basics of Christian religion.

He returned on 17 April at midday, arrayed for battle. The Spanish were alerted to the surprise attack by one of the local natives; even so a violent struggle ensued that resulted in the wounding of various Spanish defenders. The use of their small number of horses assisted them, since they struck fear into the enemy. The Chorotega attack was beaten off, and Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila immediately sent messengers to call back an advance party consisting of friar Ag\u00fcero accompanied by a number of soldiers, who had been advancing towards Diriang\u00e9n's territory. The violent opposition of the Chorotega convinced Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila and his officers to turn back with the gold they had already collected.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 62.</ref> They marched back south through Nicarao territory, by now suspicious of all indigenous activity. They took up a defensive formation, in a compact group with a single mounted soldier on each side. In the main group, sixty of the fittest soldiers went ready for battle, while the wounded travelled with the supplies, gold, and native porters in the centre.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p63\"/> They were met with passively hostile reactions from the natives they passed, until they finally met a number of Nicarao nobles, who apologised for the hostile reception.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 63\u201364.</ref> Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila accepted the apology, due to the vulnerability of his forces. They spent the next night in a state of alert upon a hilltop; the next day they continued their retreat in defensive formation, crossing lands abandoned by the Indians until they reached the safety of their ships on the Pacific coast. Andr\u00e9s Ni\u00f1o had returned to the anchorage a few days previously, but all the ships were in poor repair and the Spanish expedition was forced to make the arduous journey back to Panama in canoes.
