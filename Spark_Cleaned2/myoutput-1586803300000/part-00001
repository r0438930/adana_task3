Most of its lines became part of the [[Plant System]] in 1899 and the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]] in 1902.  The line remains in service today with a vast majority of it now being [[CSX Transportation]]'s [[Sanford Subdivision]].\n\n==History==\nThe '''Tampa, Peace Creek and St. Johns River Railroad''' was incorporated in 1879, and received a charter to build a railroad from [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] to [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]. The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway was incorporated in 1871, and acquired the railway charter from the Tampa, Peace Creek and St. Johns River Railroad. Construction of a rail line from Jacksonville to [[Palatka, Florida|Palatka]] began in March 1883, and regular service between the cities began in March 1884. The railroad was built to the [[5 ft and 1520 mm gauge railways|5-foot gauge]] to match that of the [[Plant System]] Waycross and Florida Railroad, with which it connected in Jacksonville. The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway extended its line from Palatka to [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]] in 1885, using the right-of-way of the '''Palatka and Indian River Railway Company'''. The line crossed the [[St. Johns River]] a few miles south of Palatka and ran southward on the east side of the river to the northern end of [[Lake Monroe (Florida)|Lake Monroe]], crossed back over the river and then ran a few miles to Sanford, where it connected to the [[South Florida Railroad]]. The line to Sanford began regular service in February 1886.<ref name=Pettengill>{{Cite book|last=Pettengill|first=George W., Jr.|url=|title=The Story of the Florida Railroads 1834\u20131903|publisher=The Southeast Chapter of The Railway & Locomotive Historical Society, Inc.|year=1998|isbn=|series=Bulletin of the Railway & Locomotive Historical Society, Inc.|volume=86|location=Jacksonville, Florida|edition=Reprint|pages=80\u201382|orig-year=1952}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Atlantic Coast, St. Johns and Indian River Railroad]] completed a line from [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]], on the [[Indian River (Florida)|Indian River]], to [[Enterprise, Florida|Enterprise]], on the eastern shore of Lake Monroe opposite Sanford, in early 1886.

The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway then leased the Atlantic Coast, St. Johns and Indian River Railroad, and purchased all of its rolling stock.
