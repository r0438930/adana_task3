Way of life, and style in day-to-day life became increasingly important - interiors were refurbished and changed, new fashion styles were followed. Fashion design became more important. New sorts of design appeared, such as electronic graphic design.\n\n[[Per Mollerup]], Danish researcher of design, made a study of the possibilities of Lithuanian design, \"Design in Lithuania - guaranty of concurrent advantage\". One of its conclusions is that there are more trained designers working in Lithuania than in other Baltic countries. Creators of graphic design united in the Lithuanian Association of Graphic Design. The Lithuanian design review ''Design index'' is published yearly. Digital design overlaps the borders of graphic design; the software for picture editing and its innovative design [[Pixelmator]] were created.

Way of life, and style in day-to-day life became increasingly important - interiors were refurbished and changed, new fashion styles were followed. Fashion design became more important. New sorts of design appeared, such as electronic graphic design.\n\n[[Per Mollerup]], Danish researcher of design, made a study of the possibilities of Lithuanian design, \"Design in Lithuania - guaranty of concurrent advantage\". One of its conclusions is that there are more trained designers working in Lithuania than in other Baltic countries. Creators of graphic design united in the Lithuanian Association of Graphic Design. The Lithuanian design review ''Design index'' is published yearly. Digital design overlaps the borders of graphic design; the software for picture editing and its innovative design [[Pixelmator]] were created.
