Kay has written, produced, and acted in several television and film projects, and authored three books.\n\nBorn and brought up in [[Bolton]], [[Lancashire]], Kay studied media performance at the [[University of Salford]]. He began working part-time as a stand-up comedian, winning the North West Comedian of the Year award. In 1997, he won [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[So You Think You're Funny]]'' contest and the following year was nominated for a [[Perrier Award]] for his show at the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]]. With his public profile raised, in 2000, he co-wrote and starred in ''[[That Peter Kay Thing]]'' for [[Channel 4]]. This resulted in a spin-off sitcom, ''[[Phoenix Nights]]'', which ran for two series from 2001\u201302, and in turn generated another spin-off, ''[[Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere]]'', in 2004. In 2005, he recorded a promotional video in which he mimed to [[Tony Christie]]'s 1971 hit \"[[Is This the Way to Amarillo]]\"; the song then reached number 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming that year's best-selling single in the UK.\n\nIn 2008, Kay co-wrote and starred in ''[[Britain's Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice]]'', a parody of several British [[reality television]] shows. As the series' fictional protagonist Geraldine McQueen, he released the single \"[[The Winner's Song]]\", which reached number 2 in the UK singles chart. His 2010\u201311 [[stand-up comedy]] tour was officially inaugurated into the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the most successful of all time,<ref name=\"guin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2012/9/peter-kay-breaks-record-for-most-tickets-sold-for-a-stand-up-comedy-tour-44691|title=Peter Kay breaks record for Most tickets sold for a stand-up comedy tour|publisher=Guinness World Records|date=7 September 2012|accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref> playing to over 1.2 million people. He co-wrote and starred in ''[[Peter Kay's Car Share]]'', a sitcom screened by the [[BBC]] for two series between 2015\u201317. He also starred in the 2015 BBC sitcom ''[[Cradle to Grave]]''. \n\nIn 2016, Kay won the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Male Comedy Performance|BAFTA TV Award for Best Male Comedy Performance]], the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Situation Comedy|BAFTA TV Award for Best Scripted Comedy]] and the [[21st National Television Awards|National Television Award for Best Comedy]] for ''Car Share''.

He took several minor jobs, including working in a toilet roll factory, a [[Netto (store)|Netto supermarket]], [[Manchester Arena]], a cash and carry, a cinema, a petrol station and a bingo hall, which later inspired episodes for ''[[That Peter Kay Thing]]''.\n\nHe began a degree course at the [[University of Liverpool]] in Drama, Theatre Studies and English Literature.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>  Struggling with the course, he changed to studying a [[Higher National Diploma]] (HND) in media performance (including stand-up) at the [[University of Salford]]'s Adelphi Campus School of Media, Music and Performance.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  In recognition of his contribution to the entertainment industry, Kay went on to receive an Honorary Doctor of Arts degree from his [[alma mater]] on 19 July 2016, at Salford's Lowry Theatre.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nHis first stand-up was the competition the North West Comedian of the Year, which was held in [[Manchester]] and hosted by [[Dave Spikey]], who would later be the co-star and co-writer of ''[[Phoenix Nights]]''. Kay was last on the bill and won the competition, beating [[Johnny Vegas]]. Kay has said that he sought a career in comedy. However, he continued to work part-time as an usher at his local cinema in Bolton whilst performing stand-up locally. When the cinema closed, he was presented with the choice of finding another job or moving into comedy full-time.\n\nAfter he entered and won Channel 4's ''[[So You Think You're Funny?]]'' contest in 1997, his first semi-professional stand-up appearances were at the 1998 [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]], where he received a prestigious [[Perrier Award]] nomination. During this time, he also appeared at various other clubs, such as London's [[The Comedy Store (London)|Comedy Store]].\n\nAlthough this led to a certain level of public recognition, it was only after his first live video show Live at the Top of the Tower in 2000 that Kay attained mainstream recognition. During this period, he appeared on several chat shows, such as ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' and ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'', on the latter of which he had previously served as warm-up. It was at this time that production also began on ''Phoenix Nights''. Subsequent advertisements for [[John Smith's Brewery|John Smith's]] bitter which imitate the style of ''Phoenix Nights'' saw Kay develop his catchphrases \"'ave it!\" and \"two lamb bhunas\".\n\nIn a Bolton nightclub in 1998, Kay met Susan Gargan whilst he was working at the local cinema. They married in 2001 after being in a relationship for three years. They have remained very private about their children. They have a teenage son, Charlie Michael Kay (that they named after their fathers, with Charlie being the name of Susan's late father). They are also thought to have other children.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===1997\u20132000: Early career===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2015}}\nKay's first TV project was in a 1997 episode of ''New Voices'', a comedy series which showcased rising talent. His episode, \"Two Minutes\", written by Johanne McAndrew, saw him play a getaway driver as two of his friends attempted to rob a pub of its takings. In 1997, he played a delivery driver in the BBC drama ''[[Born to Run (TV series)|Born to Run]]''.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrvAsNTKKYQ</ref> After presenting a slot titled \"Peter Kay's World of Entertainment\" on BBC Two's ''[[The Sunday Show]]'', Kay made an episode of Channel 4's ''[[Comedy Lab]]'', \"The Services\", in 1998, which won a [[Royal Television Society]] award for best newcomer. This served as a pilot for ''[[That Peter Kay Thing]]''. Following the series' success, Kay and his co-writers \u2013 [[Neil Fitzmaurice]] and [[Dave Spikey]] \u2013 used the episode \"In the Club\" as the basis for ''Phoenix Nights'', which was an immediate hit. Set in a newly refurbished social club run by Brian Potter, the first series was filmed in part at St Gregory's Social Club in [[Farnworth]], [[Greater Manchester]], where the exterior, hallways and function suite were used.\n\nIn 2004, Kay followed the success with ''[[Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere]]'', a spin-off of ''Phoenix Nights''. The show featured the bouncer characters from the show\u2014played by Kay and [[Paddy McGuinness]]\u2014and at times also featured other characters from ''Phoenix Nights''. Six episodes were made and broadcast from November to December 2004 by Channel 4. In 2005, Kay was awarded a [[Rose d'Or]] at the international television festival in [[Montreux]] for Best Performance by an Actor.\n\nOn 17 April 2006, Channel 4 broadcast a \"Peter Kay Night\", showing out-takes from ''Phoenix Nights'' (previously featured on DVD), a behind-the-scenes documentary \"180&nbsp;\u2013 A Tour Documentary\" which followed Kay behind the scenes of his ''Mum Wants a Bungalow'' tour and screened the whole Peter Kay Live in Manchester Arena show. In 2008, he returned to television after an absence of four years with the BAFTA-winning satire of reality talent shows, ''[[Peter Kay's Britain's Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice]]'', which he co-wrote with Paul Coleman. The two-hour special was screened on Channel 4 on 17 October 2008. Kay won his second Royal Television Society award for best actor for playing Geraldine McQueen, a transsexual dinner lady from Ireland.\n\n===2000\u20132011: Stage shows===\nKay has released several DVDs of live performances, including  \"Live at the Top of the Tower'', ''Live at the Bolton Albert Halls'' (which holds the record as biggest selling British stand-up DVD), ''Peter Kay: The Live Collections'' (the previous two combined), ''Peter Kay: Live at Manchester Arena'', and ''Peter Kay Live \u2013 The Tour That Didn't Tour Tour'' (which was recorded during his fifteen-night sold-out run at [[The O2 Arena]] in London).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===BBC work===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2015}}\nIn 2007, Kay followed this success with a cover version of \"[[I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)]]\", originally by [[the Proclaimers]], for Comic Relief. The video featured a celebration of British talent. In 2009, Kay switched his musical fund-raising to Children in Need with the release of Peter Kay's All Star Animated Band, which had taken two years to complete. He brought together over 100 animated children's characters in a six-minute animated medley. These characters included [[Thomas the Tank Engine]], [[Bob the Builder]] and [[Paddington Bear]]. It also featured some of the characters' original voice artists including [[Bernard Cribbins]], [[Neil Morrissey]], [[Ken Barrie]] and [[Ringo Starr]]. The video was premiered on BBC1 on 20 November 2009.\n\nKay returned his support to Comic Relief in 2011 with a cover version of \"I Know Him So Well\". The song was re-recorded by multi-platinum selling singer [[Susan Boyle]] and Kay in the guise of Geraldine McQueen from ''Britain's Got the Pop Factor''. The video which accompanied the single was also directed by Kay and identically parodied the original video shot for shot. It premiered on Comic Relief on Friday, 18 March 2011.\n\nIn May 2015 his own sitcom ''[[Peter Kay's Car Share]]'' began to air. The series was a success and a second series was commissioned to start in April 2017. In October 2015, he starred in ''[[Cradle to Grave]]'' another BBC sitcom based on [[Danny Baker]]'s life as a teenager.\n\n===Return to stand-up===\nIn November 2009, after an absence of seven years, Kay announced a return to stand-up with four (later extended to 20) dates at the [[Manchester Arena]] the following April with a show entitled [[The Tour That Doesn't Tour Tour...Now On Tour]]. Demand for tickets caused him to announce soon after that the show would be toured. In January 2012, the tour entered the ''Guinness Book of World Records'' as the most successful stand-up comedy tour of all time, playing to a total of 1.2 million people.<ref name=\"guin\"/>\n\nKay's tour faced criticism when his disabled fans were hit with bills of up to \u00a339 on premium phone lines booking tour tickets.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/peter-kays-disabled-fans-hit-11586550|title=Peter Kay\u2019s disabled fans hit with bills up to \u00a339 on premium rate ticket line|first=Stephen|last=Hayward|date=25 November 2017|work=Daily Mirror|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2017, Kay announced his intention to return to stand-up with his first tour in eight years.

Kay has written, produced, and acted in several television and film projects, and authored three books.\n\nBorn and brought up in [[Bolton]], [[Lancashire]], Kay studied media performance at the [[University of Salford]]. He began working part-time as a stand-up comedian, winning the North West Comedian of the Year award. In 1997, he won [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[So You Think You're Funny]]'' contest and the following year was nominated for a [[Perrier Award]] for his show at the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]]. With his public profile raised, in 2000, he co-wrote and starred in ''[[That Peter Kay Thing]]'' for [[Channel 4]]. This resulted in a spin-off sitcom, ''[[Phoenix Nights]]'', which ran for two series from 2001\u201302, and in turn generated another spin-off, ''[[Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere]]'', in 2004. In 2005, he recorded a promotional video in which he mimed to [[Tony Christie]]'s 1971 hit \"[[Is This the Way to Amarillo]]\"; the song then reached number 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming that year's best-selling single in the UK.\n\nIn 2008, Kay co-wrote and starred in ''[[Britain's Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice]]'', a parody of several British [[reality television]] shows. As the series' fictional protagonist Geraldine McQueen, he released the single \"[[The Winner's Song]]\", which reached number 2 in the UK singles chart. His 2010\u201311 [[stand-up comedy]] tour was officially inaugurated into the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the most successful of all time,<ref name=\"guin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2012/9/peter-kay-breaks-record-for-most-tickets-sold-for-a-stand-up-comedy-tour-44691|title=Peter Kay breaks record for Most tickets sold for a stand-up comedy tour|publisher=Guinness World Records|date=7 September 2012|accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref> playing to over 1.2 million people. He co-wrote and starred in ''[[Peter Kay's Car Share]]'', a sitcom screened by the [[BBC]] for two series between 2015\u201317. He also starred in the 2015 BBC sitcom ''[[Cradle to Grave]]''. \n\nIn 2016, Kay won the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Male Comedy Performance|BAFTA TV Award for Best Male Comedy Performance]], the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Situation Comedy|BAFTA TV Award for Best Scripted Comedy]] and the [[21st National Television Awards|National Television Award for Best Comedy]] for ''Car Share''.

He took several minor jobs, including working in a toilet roll factory, a [[Netto (store)|Netto supermarket]], [[Manchester Arena]], a cash and carry, a cinema, a petrol station and a bingo hall, which later inspired episodes for ''[[That Peter Kay Thing]]''.\n\nHe began a degree course at the [[University of Liverpool]] in Drama, Theatre Studies and English Literature.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>  Struggling with the course, he changed to studying a [[Higher National Diploma]] (HND) in media performance (including stand-up) at the [[University of Salford]]'s Adelphi Campus School of Media, Music and Performance.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  In recognition of his contribution to the entertainment industry, Kay went on to receive an Honorary Doctor of Arts degree from his [[alma mater]] on 19 July 2016, at Salford's Lowry Theatre.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nHis first stand-up was the competition the North West Comedian of the Year, which was held in [[Manchester]] and hosted by [[Dave Spikey]], who would later be the co-star and co-writer of ''[[Phoenix Nights]]''. Kay was last on the bill and won the competition, beating [[Johnny Vegas]]. Kay has said that he sought a career in comedy. However, he continued to work part-time as an usher at his local cinema in Bolton whilst performing stand-up locally. When the cinema closed, he was presented with the choice of finding another job or moving into comedy full-time.\n\nAfter he entered and won Channel 4's ''[[So You Think You're Funny?]]'' contest in 1997, his first semi-professional stand-up appearances were at the 1998 [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]], where he received a prestigious [[Perrier Award]] nomination. During this time, he also appeared at various other clubs, such as London's [[The Comedy Store (London)|Comedy Store]].\n\nAlthough this led to a certain level of public recognition, it was only after his first live video show Live at the Top of the Tower in 2000 that Kay attained mainstream recognition. During this period, he appeared on several chat shows, such as ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' and ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'', on the latter of which he had previously served as warm-up. It was at this time that production also began on ''Phoenix Nights''. Subsequent advertisements for [[John Smith's Brewery|John Smith's]] bitter which imitate the style of ''Phoenix Nights'' saw Kay develop his catchphrases \"'ave it!\" and \"two lamb bhunas\".\n\nIn a Bolton nightclub in 1998, Kay met Susan Gargan whilst he was working at the local cinema. They married in 2001 after being in a relationship for three years. They have remained very private about their children. They have a teenage son, Charlie Michael Kay (that they named after their fathers, with Charlie being the name of Susan's late father). They are also thought to have other children.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===1997\u20132000: Early career===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2015}}\nKay's first TV project was in a 1997 episode of ''New Voices'', a comedy series which showcased rising talent. His episode, \"Two Minutes\", written by Johanne McAndrew, saw him play a getaway driver as two of his friends attempted to rob a pub of its takings. In 1997, he played a delivery driver in the BBC drama ''[[Born to Run (TV series)|Born to Run]]''.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrvAsNTKKYQ</ref> After presenting a slot titled \"Peter Kay's World of Entertainment\" on BBC Two's ''[[The Sunday Show]]'', Kay made an episode of Channel 4's ''[[Comedy Lab]]'', \"The Services\", in 1998, which won a [[Royal Television Society]] award for best newcomer. This served as a pilot for ''[[That Peter Kay Thing]]''. Following the series' success, Kay and his co-writers \u2013 [[Neil Fitzmaurice]] and [[Dave Spikey]] \u2013 used the episode \"In the Club\" as the basis for ''Phoenix Nights'', which was an immediate hit. Set in a newly refurbished social club run by Brian Potter, the first series was filmed in part at St Gregory's Social Club in [[Farnworth]], [[Greater Manchester]], where the exterior, hallways and function suite were used.\n\nIn 2004, Kay followed the success with ''[[Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere]]'', a spin-off of ''Phoenix Nights''. The show featured the bouncer characters from the show\u2014played by Kay and [[Paddy McGuinness]]\u2014and at times also featured other characters from ''Phoenix Nights''. Six episodes were made and broadcast from November to December 2004 by Channel 4. In 2005, Kay was awarded a [[Rose d'Or]] at the international television festival in [[Montreux]] for Best Performance by an Actor.\n\nOn 17 April 2006, Channel 4 broadcast a \"Peter Kay Night\", showing out-takes from ''Phoenix Nights'' (previously featured on DVD), a behind-the-scenes documentary \"180&nbsp;\u2013 A Tour Documentary\" which followed Kay behind the scenes of his ''Mum Wants a Bungalow'' tour and screened the whole Peter Kay Live in Manchester Arena show. In 2008, he returned to television after an absence of four years with the BAFTA-winning satire of reality talent shows, ''[[Peter Kay's Britain's Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice]]'', which he co-wrote with Paul Coleman. The two-hour special was screened on Channel 4 on 17 October 2008. Kay won his second Royal Television Society award for best actor for playing Geraldine McQueen, a transsexual dinner lady from Ireland.\n\n===2000\u20132011: Stage shows===\nKay has released several DVDs of live performances, including  \"Live at the Top of the Tower'', ''Live at the Bolton Albert Halls'' (which holds the record as biggest selling British stand-up DVD), ''Peter Kay: The Live Collections'' (the previous two combined), ''Peter Kay: Live at Manchester Arena'', and ''Peter Kay Live \u2013 The Tour That Didn't Tour Tour'' (which was recorded during his fifteen-night sold-out run at [[The O2 Arena]] in London).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===BBC work===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2015}}\nIn 2007, Kay followed this success with a cover version of \"[[I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)]]\", originally by [[the Proclaimers]], for Comic Relief. The video featured a celebration of British talent. In 2009, Kay switched his musical fund-raising to Children in Need with the release of Peter Kay's All Star Animated Band, which had taken two years to complete. He brought together over 100 animated children's characters in a six-minute animated medley. These characters included [[Thomas the Tank Engine]], [[Bob the Builder]] and [[Paddington Bear]]. It also featured some of the characters' original voice artists including [[Bernard Cribbins]], [[Neil Morrissey]], [[Ken Barrie]] and [[Ringo Starr]]. The video was premiered on BBC1 on 20 November 2009.\n\nKay returned his support to Comic Relief in 2011 with a cover version of \"I Know Him So Well\". The song was re-recorded by multi-platinum selling singer [[Susan Boyle]] and Kay in the guise of Geraldine McQueen from ''Britain's Got the Pop Factor''. The video which accompanied the single was also directed by Kay and identically parodied the original video shot for shot. It premiered on Comic Relief on Friday, 18 March 2011.\n\nIn May 2015 his own sitcom ''[[Peter Kay's Car Share]]'' began to air. The series was a success and a second series was commissioned to start in April 2017. In October 2015, he starred in ''[[Cradle to Grave]]'' another BBC sitcom based on [[Danny Baker]]'s life as a teenager.\n\n===Return to stand-up===\nIn November 2009, after an absence of seven years, Kay announced a return to stand-up with four (later extended to 20) dates at the [[Manchester Arena]] the following April with a show entitled [[The Tour That Doesn't Tour Tour...Now On Tour]]. Demand for tickets caused him to announce soon after that the show would be toured. In January 2012, the tour entered the ''Guinness Book of World Records'' as the most successful stand-up comedy tour of all time, playing to a total of 1.2 million people.<ref name=\"guin\"/>\n\nKay's tour faced criticism when his disabled fans were hit with bills of up to \u00a339 on premium phone lines booking tour tickets.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/peter-kays-disabled-fans-hit-11586550|title=Peter Kay\u2019s disabled fans hit with bills up to \u00a339 on premium rate ticket line|first=Stephen|last=Hayward|date=25 November 2017|work=Daily Mirror|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2017, Kay announced his intention to return to stand-up with his first tour in eight years.
