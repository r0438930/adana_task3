The game takes place in an Earth-type environment with metallic, land-based enemies; some are mobile armor and others are fortifications embedded in natural terrain.\n\nCertain enemies leave power-up stars upon destruction. Collecting these stars \"turns on\" an upgrade menu at the bottom of the screen and moves a lit cursor through the list of power-ups described below. If any power-up is lit, but a ship is lost before a power-up could be selected, the star is \"carried over\" and the Speed block is lit on the next life. Single hits to the unshielded main ship destroy it, and the player loses any accumulated upgrades including Speed. This can make successive lives difficult to keep in the heat of battle.\n\nThis game does not support [[continue (video gaming)|continue]]s with extra credits, and is believed to \"loop\" endlessly; that is, after the final boss, gameplay resumes at the beginning of the play map but at successively higher difficulty, with enemies shooting faster and more frequently. Also, the score stops increasing when it displays 9,999,990 points, which might be achieved as early as the 15th, 16th, or 17th loops ([http://replay.marpirc.net/r/slapfighb1 beginning of 17th verified via MAME]).\n\n=== Power-ups ===\n{{Expand section|date=March 2020}}\nPower-ups appearing on the upgrade menu are somewhat similar to those in ''Gradius'':\n\n* Speed (upgradeable five times cumulatively)\n* Side-Shot (rapid-fire assistant; remains with ship regardless of main weapon unless/until ship is destroyed)\n* Shot (short-range, rapid-fire)\n* Wing (accessory; increases both the width and the exposure of the craft; improves the power or speed of equipped weapon; upgradeable to three pairs; two external pairs can be used to absorb hits but the whole pair will be lost)\n* Bomb (short-range, slow fire, area effect)\n* Laser (long-range)\n* Homing Missile (releases up to sixteen guided missiles) \n* Shield (invulnerability; lasts approx. 25 seconds, or 3 hits, whichever comes first; ends with audible warning)\n\nThe major weapons affect the enemies and terrain differently. For example, certain enemy towers can only be destroyed with Laser or Homing Missile; other enemies are destroyed ''much faster'' with specific weapons to match. If Bomb or Homing Missile are equipped, certain bonus targets will appear, or parts of the landscape may be destroyed to reveal bonuses. If Laser is active, certain plants in the landscape can be shot repeatedly to 'grow' and earn extra points until they scroll off-screen.\nIt has been reported that a bug in the game enabled the player to obtain all power-ups, simply by allowing themselves to be killed by the first enemy appearing upon starting the game without touching the controls. If this occurred, the next time the player ship appears, it has all the power-ups equipped.[http://www.rllmukforum.com/index.php?/topic/76529-best-trick-cheat-or-bug-in-an-arcade-game/page-2 Slap Fight bug]\n\n== Synopsis ==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2020}}\nTaking place in the year 2059 in another galaxy, mankind has colonized an alien planet called Theon after evacuating a previously colonized planet Orac.
