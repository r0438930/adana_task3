In many ways, oil refineries use much of the technology, and can be thought of, as types of [[chemical plant]]s.\n\nThe [[crude oil]] feedstock has typically been processed by an [[oil production plant]]. There is usually an [[oil depot]] at or near an oil refinery for the storage of incoming crude oil feedstock as well as bulk liquid products.\n\nPetroleum refineries are very large industrial complexes that involve many different processing units and auxiliary facilities such as utility units and storage tanks. Each refinery has its own unique arrangement and combination of refining processes largely determined by the refinery location, desired products and economic considerations.\n\nAn oil refinery is considered an essential part of the [[Downstream (petroleum industry)|downstream]] side of the [[petroleum industry]].\n\nSome modern petroleum refineries process as much as 800,000 to 900,000 barrels (127,000 to 143,000 cubic meters) of crude oil per day.\n\nAccording to the Oil and Gas Journal in the world a total of 636 refineries were operated on the 31 December 2014 for a total capacity of {{convert|87.75|Moilbbl|m3}}.\n\n[[Jamnagar Refinery]] is the largest oil refinery, since 25 December 2008, with a processing capacity of {{convert|1.24|Moilbbl|m3}}.

Another close contender for the title of hosting the world's oldest oil refinery is [[Salzbergen]] in [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]]. Salzbergen's refinery was opened in 1860.\n\nAt one point, the refinery in [[Ras Tanura]], [[Saudi Arabia]] owned by [[Saudi Aramco]] was claimed to be the largest oil refinery in the world. For most of the 20th century, the largest refinery was the [[Abadan Refinery]] in [[Iran]]. This refinery suffered extensive damage during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. Since 25 December 2008, the world's largest refinery complex is the [[Jamnagar Refinery]] Complex, consisting of two refineries side by side operated by [[Reliance Industries Limited]] in Jamnagar, India with a combined production capacity of {{convert|1240000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}.

Some refineries also had [[vacuum distillation]] units as well as [[thermal cracking]] units such as [[visbreaker]]s (viscosity breakers, units to lower the [[viscosity]] of the oil). All of the many other refining processes discussed below were developed during the war or within a few years after the war. They became commercially available within 5 to 10 years after the war ended and the worldwide petroleum industry experienced very rapid growth. The driving force for that growth in technology and in the number and size of refineries worldwide was the growing demand for automotive gasoline and aircraft fuel.\n\nIn the United States, for various complex economic and political reasons, the construction of new refineries came to a virtual stop in about the 1980s. However, many of the existing refineries in the United States have revamped many of their units and/or constructed add-on units in order to: increase their crude oil processing capacity, increase the [[octane]] rating of their product gasoline, lower the [[sulfur]] content of their diesel fuel and home heating fuels to comply with environmental regulations and comply with environmental air pollution and water pollution requirements.[[File:ExxonMobil Baton Rouge.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.75|[[ExxonMobil]] oil refinery in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] (the fourth-largest in the [[United States]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=oil_refining#tab4|title=U.S. Energy Information Administration: Top 10 U.S. Refineries Operable Capacity|accessdate=2015-01-26}}</ref>]]\n\nThe size of oil refining market in 2017 was valued over US$6 trillion in 2017 and is set to witness a consumption of over 100 million barrels per day (MBPD) by 2024. Oil refining market will witness an appreciable growth because of rapid industrialization and economic transformation. Changing demographics, growing population and improvement in living standards across developing nations are some of factors positively influencing the industry landscape.\n\n=== Oil refining in the United States ===\n{{main|Petroleum refining in the United States}}\nIn the 19th century, refineries in the U.S. processed crude oil primarily to recover the [[kerosene]]. There was no market for the more volatile fraction, including gasoline, which was considered waste and was often dumped directly into the nearest river. The invention of the automobile shifted the demand to gasoline and diesel, which remain the primary refined products today.\n\nToday, national and state legislation require refineries to meet stringent air and water cleanliness standards. In fact, oil companies in the U.S. perceive obtaining a permit to build a modern refinery to be so difficult and costly that no new refineries were built (though many have been expanded) in the U.S. from 1976 until 2014, when the small Dakota Prairie Refinery in North Dakota began operation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials/041113-651604-dakota-prairie-refinery-open-in-2014.htm|title=North Dakota Builds A Refinery, First In The U.S. Since '76|date=April 11, 2013|work=[[Investor's Business Daily]]|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref> More than half the refineries that existed in 1981 are now closed due to low utilization rates and accelerating mergers.<ref>[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/workshops/energymarkets/background/hazle.pdf White Paper on Refining Capacity] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527201629/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/workshops/energymarkets/background/hazle.pdf |date=2010-05-27 }}, Federal Trade Commission, April, 2007.</ref> As a result of these closures total US refinery capacity fell between 1981 and 1995, though the operating capacity stayed fairly constant in that time period at around {{convert|15000000|oilbbl/d}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=mocggus2&f=a|title=U.

In 1982 (the earliest data provided), the United States operated 301 refineries with a combined capacity of {{convert|17.9|Moilbbl|m3}} of crude oil each calendar day. In 2010, there were 149 operable U.S. refineries with a combined capacity of {{convert|17.6|Moilbbl|m3}} per calendar day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Resources/campaigns/GasPrices_2011/Documents/StatisticsDefinitions.pdf|title=2011 The U.S. Petroleum Industry: Statistics & Definitions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927143919/http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Resources/campaigns/GasPrices_2011/Documents/StatisticsDefinitions.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-27|url-status=dead|accessdate=2011-11-05}}</ref> By 2014 the number of refinery had reduced to 140 but the total capacity increased to {{convert|18.02|Moilbbl|m3}} per calendar day. Indeed, in order to reduce operating costs and depreciation, refining is operated in fewer sites but of bigger capacity.\n\nIn 2009 through 2010, as revenue streams in the oil business dried up and profitability of oil refineries fell due to lower demand for product and high reserves of supply preceding the [[Late-2000s recession|economic recession]], oil companies began to close or sell the less profitable refineries.\n\n==Operation==\nRaw or unprocessed crude oil is not generally useful in industrial applications, although \"light, sweet\" (low viscosity, low [[sulfur]]) crude oil has been used directly as a burner fuel to produce steam for the propulsion of seagoing vessels. The lighter elements, however, form explosive vapors in the fuel tanks and are therefore hazardous, especially in [[warships]]. Instead, the hundreds of different hydrocarbon molecules in crude oil are separated in a refinery into components that can be used as [[fuels]], [[lubricants]], and feedstocks in [[petrochemical]] processes that manufacture such products as [[plastic]]s, [[detergent]]s, [[solvent]]s, [[elastomer]]s, and [[fiber]]s such as [[nylon]] and [[polyesters]].\n\n[[Petroleum]] [[fossil fuels]] are burned in internal combustion engines to provide power for [[ships]], [[automobiles]], [[aircraft engine]]s, [[lawn mower]]s, [[dirt bikes]], and other machines. Different [[boiling point]]s allow the [[hydrocarbon]]s to be separated by [[distillation]]. Since the lighter liquid products are in great demand for use in internal combustion engines, a modern refinery will convert heavy hydrocarbons and lighter gaseous elements into these higher value products.\n[[File:Haifa Refinery by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|The oil refinery in [[Haifa, Israel]] is capable of processing about 9 million tons (66 million barrels) of [[crude oil]] a year.  Its two [[cooling tower]]s are landmarks of the city's skyline.]]\nOil can be used in a variety of ways because it contains hydrocarbons of varying [[molecular mass]]es, forms and lengths such as [[Alkane|paraffin]]s, [[aromatic]]s, [[naphthene]]s (or [[cycloalkane]]s), [[alkene]]s, [[diene]]s, and [[alkyne]]s. While the molecules in crude oil include different atoms such as sulfur and nitrogen, the hydrocarbons are the most common form of molecules, which are molecules of varying lengths and complexity made of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon]] [[atom]]s, and a small number of oxygen atoms. The differences in the structure of these molecules account for their varying [[Physical property|physical]] and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]], and it is this variety that makes crude oil useful in a broad range of several applications.\n\nOnce separated and purified of any contaminants and impurities, the fuel or lubricant can be sold without further processing. Smaller molecules such as [[isobutane]] and [[propylene]] or [[butylene]]s can be recombined to meet specific [[octane rating|octane]] requirements by processes such as [[alkylation]], or more commonly, [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimerization]]. The octane grade of gasoline can also be improved by [[catalytic reforming]], which involves removing [[hydrogen]] from hydrocarbons producing compounds with higher octane ratings such as [[aromatics]].  Intermediate products such as [[gasoil]]s can even be reprocessed to break a heavy, long-chained oil into a lighter short-chained one, by various forms of [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] such as [[fluid catalytic cracking]], [[thermal cracking]], and [[hydrocracking]]. The final step in gasoline production is the blending of fuels with different octane ratings, [[vapor pressure]]s, and other properties to meet product specifications. Another method for reprocessing and upgrading these intermediate products (residual oils) uses a [[wikt:devolatilization|devolatilization]]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} process to separate usable oil from the waste asphaltene material.\n\nOil refineries are large scale plants, processing about a hundred thousand to several hundred thousand [[Barrel (volume)|barrel]]s of crude oil a day.  Because of the high capacity, many of the units operate [[Continuous production|continuously]], as opposed to processing in [[Batch production|batches]], at [[steady state]] or nearly steady state for months to years.  The high capacity also makes [[process optimization]] and [[advanced process control]] very desirable.\n\n==Major products==\n[[File:Crude Oil Distillation-en.svg|thumb|right|[[Crude oil]] is separated into fractions by [[fractional distillation]]. The fractions at the top of the [[fractionating column]] have lower [[boiling point]]s than the fractions at the bottom. The heavy bottom fractions are often [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracked]] into lighter, more useful products. All of the fractions are processed further in other refining units.]]\n\n[[File:Usesofpetroleum.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A breakdown of the products made from a typical barrel of US oil.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pnp_pct_dc_nus_pct_m.htm |title=U.S. Energy Information Administration > Petroleum > Navigator > Refinery Yield |access-date=2018-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306111912/http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pnp_pct_dc_nus_pct_m.htm |archive-date=2011-03-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>]]\n\nPetroleum products are materials derived from crude oil ([[petroleum]]) as it is processed in [[oil refineries]]. The majority of petroleum is converted to petroleum products, which includes several classes of fuels.<ref>Walther W. Irion, Otto S. Neuwirth, \"Oil Refining\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a18_051}}</ref>\n\nOil refineries also produce various intermediate products such as [[hydrogen]], light hydrocarbons, [[reformate]] and [[pyrolysis gasoline]]. These are not usually transported but instead are blended or processed further on-site. Chemical plants are thus often adjacent to oil refineries or a number of further chemical processes are integrated into it. For example, light hydrocarbons are [[Steam cracking|steam-cracked]] in an [[ethylene]] plant, and the produced ethylene is polymerized to produce [[polyethene]].\n\nBecause technical reasons and environment protection demand a very low sulfur content in all but the heaviest products, it is transformed to [[hydrogen sulfide]] via catalytic [[hydrodesulfurization]] and removed from the product stream via [[amine gas treating]]. Using the [[Claus process]], hydrogen sulfide is afterwards transformed to elementary sulfur to be sold to the chemical industry. The rather large heat energy freed by this process is directly used in the other parts of the refinery. Often an electrical power plant is combined into the whole refinery process to take up the excess heat.\n\nAccording to the composition of the crude oil and depending on the demands of the market, refineries can produce different shares of petroleum products. The largest share of oil products is used as \"energy carriers\", i.e.  various grades of [[fuel oil]] and [[gasoline]].  These [[fuel]]s include or can be blended to give gasoline, [[jet fuel]], [[diesel fuel]], [[heating oil]], and heavier fuel oils.  Heavier (less [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]]) fractions can also be used to produce [[asphalt]], [[tar]], [[paraffin wax]], [[Lubricant|lubricating]] and other heavy oils.  Refineries also produce other [[chemicals]], some of which are used in [[chemical process]]es to produce [[plastics]] and other useful materials.  Since petroleum often contains a few percent [[sulfur]]-containing molecules, elemental sulfur is also often produced as a petroleum product. [[Carbon]], in the form of [[petroleum coke]], and [[hydrogen]] may also be produced as petroleum products.  The hydrogen produced is often used as an intermediate product for other oil refinery processes such as [[hydrocracking]] and [[hydrodesulfurization]].\n\nPetroleum products are usually grouped into four categories: light distillates (LPG, gasoline, naphtha), middle distillates (kerosene, jet fuel, diesel), heavy distillates and residuum (heavy fuel oil, lubricating oils, wax, asphalt). These require blending various feedstocks, mixing appropriate additives, providing short-term storage, and preparation for bulk loading to trucks, barges, product ships, and railcars. This classification is based on the way crude oil is distilled and separated into fractions.<ref name=\"Leffler2\"/>\n\n*[[Gaseous fuel]] such as [[Liquified petroleum gas]] and [[propane]], stored and shipped in liquid form under pressure.\n*[[Lubricant]]s (produces light machine oils, [[motor oil]]s, and [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]]s, adding [[viscosity]] stabilizers as required), usually shipped in bulk to an offsite packaging plant.\n*[[Paraffin wax]], used in the packaging of [[frozen food]]s, among others.

For example, the [[vacuum distillation]] unit may also produce fractions that can be refined into end products such as: spindle oil used in the textile industry, light machinery oil, motor oil, and various waxes.\n\n==The crude oil distillation unit==\nThe crude oil distillation unit (CDU) is the first processing unit in virtually all petroleum refineries. The CDU distills the incoming crude oil into various fractions of different boiling ranges, each of which are then processed further in the other refinery processing units. The CDU is often referred to as the ''atmospheric distillation unit'' because it operates at slightly above atmospheric pressure.<ref name=\"Handwerk2\"/><ref name=\"Leffler2\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Kister, Henry Z.|title=Distillation Design|edition=1st |publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1992|isbn=978-0-07-034909-4}}</ref>\n\nBelow is a schematic flow diagram of a typical crude oil distillation unit. The incoming crude oil is preheated by exchanging heat with some of the hot, distilled fractions and other streams. It is then desalted to remove inorganic salts (primarily sodium chloride).\n\nFollowing the desalter, the crude oil is further heated by exchanging heat with some of the hot, distilled fractions and other streams. It is then heated in a fuel-fired furnace (fired heater) to a temperature of about 398&nbsp;\u00b0C and routed into the bottom of the distillation unit.\n\nThe cooling and condensing of the distillation tower overhead is provided partially by exchanging heat with the incoming crude oil and partially by either an air-cooled or water-cooled condenser. Additional heat is removed from the distillation column by a pumparound system as shown in the diagram below.\n\nAs shown in the flow diagram, the overhead distillate fraction from the distillation column is naphtha. The fractions removed from the side of the distillation column at various points between the column top and bottom are called ''sidecuts''. Each of the sidecuts (i.e., the kerosene, light gas oil and heavy gas oil) is cooled by exchanging heat with the incoming crude oil. All of the fractions (i.e., the overhead naphtha, the sidecuts and the bottom residue) are sent to intermediate storage tanks before being processed further.\n\n[[File:Refine.svg|center|thumb|upright=2.3|Schematic flow diagram of a typical crude oil distillation unit as used in petroleum crude oil refineries.]]\n\n==Location of petroleum refineries==\n\nA party searching for a site to construct a refinery or a chemical plant needs to consider the following issues:\n\n*The site has to be reasonably far from residential areas.\n*Infrastructure should be available for supply of raw materials and shipment of products to markets.\n*Energy to operate the plant should be available.\n*Facilities should be available for waste disposal.\n\nRefineries which use a large amount of steam and cooling water need to have an abundant source of water. Oil refineries therefore are often located nearby navigable rivers or on a sea shore, nearby a port. Such location also gives access to transportation by river or by sea. The advantages of transporting crude oil by pipeline are evident, and oil companies often transport a large volume of fuel to distribution terminals by pipeline. Pipeline may not be practical for products with small output, and rail cars, road tankers, and barges are used.\n\nPetrochemical plants and solvent manufacturing (fine fractionating) plants need spaces for further processing of a large volume of refinery products for further processing, or to mix chemical additives with a product at source rather than at blending terminals.\n\n==Safety and environment==\n[[File:BP PLANT EXPLOSION-1 lowres2.jpg|thumb|Fire-extinguishing operations after the [[Texas City Refinery explosion]].]]\nThe refining process releases a number of different chemicals into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] (see [[AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors]]) and a notable [[odor]] normally accompanies the presence of a refinery.

In the United States, there is strong pressure to prevent the development of new refineries, and no major refinery has been built in the country since [[Marathon Petroleum Company|Marathon's]] [[Garyville, Louisiana]] facility in 1976. However, many existing refineries have been expanded during that time. Environmental restrictions and pressure to prevent construction of new refineries may have also contributed to rising fuel prices in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|author=Steve Hargreaves, CNNMoney.com staff writer |url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/04/17/news/economy/refineries/index.htm |title=Behind high gas prices: The refinery crunch |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2007-04-17 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}</ref> Additionally, many refineries (more than 100 since the 1980s) have closed due to obsolescence and/or merger activity within the industry itself.\n\nEnvironmental and safety concerns mean that oil refineries are sometimes located some distance away from major urban areas. Nevertheless, there are many instances where refinery operations are close to populated areas and pose health risks.

Because it leads to equipment failure, it is a primary driver for the refinery maintenance schedule. Corrosion-related direct costs in the U.S. petroleum industry as of 1996 were estimated at US$3.7 billion.<ref name=\":7\">[http://www.nace.org/uploadedFiles/Publications/ccsupp.pdf Corrosion Costs and Preventive Strategies in the United States] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113100221/http://www.nace.org/uploadedFiles/Publications/ccsupp.pdf |date=2012-11-13 }}, a publication of [[NACE International]].</ref><ref>R.D. Kane, Corrosion in Petroleum Refining and Petrochemical Operations, Corrosion: Environments and Industries, Vol 13C, ASM Handbook, ASM International, 2006, p 967\u20131014.</ref>\n\nCorrosion occurs in various forms in the refining process, such as pitting corrosion from water droplets, embrittlement from hydrogen, and stress corrosion cracking from sulfide attack.<ref>E.N. Skinner, J.F. Mason, and J.J. Moran, High Temperature Corrosion in Refinery and Petrochemical Service, Corrosion, Vol 16 (No. 12), 1960, p 593t\u2013600t.</ref> From a materials standpoint, carbon steel is used for upwards of 80 per cent of refinery components, which is beneficial due to its low cost. [[Carbon steel]] is resistant to the most common forms of corrosion, particularly from hydrocarbon impurities at temperatures below 205&nbsp;\u00b0C, but other corrosive chemicals and environments prevent its use everywhere. Common replacement materials are [[low alloy steel]]s containing [[chromium]] and [[molybdenum]], with [[stainless steels]] containing more chromium dealing with more corrosive environments. More expensive materials commonly used are [[nickel]], [[titanium]], and [[copper]] alloys. These are primarily saved for the most problematic areas where extremely high temperatures and/or very corrosive chemicals are present.<ref>E.L. Hildebrand, Materials Selection for Petroleum Refineries and Petrochemical Plants, Mater. Prot. Perform., Vol 11 (No. 7), 1972, p19\u201322.</ref>\n\nCorrosion is fought by a complex system of monitoring, preventative repairs and careful use of materials. Monitoring methods include both offline checks taken during maintenance and online monitoring. Offline checks measure corrosion after it has occurred, telling the engineer when equipment must be replaced based on the historical information they have collected. This is referred to as preventative management.\n\nOnline systems are a more modern development, and are revolutionizing the way corrosion is approached.  There are several types of online corrosion monitoring technologies such as linear polarization resistance, [[electrochemical noise]] and electrical resistance.  Online monitoring has generally had slow reporting rates in the past (minutes or hours) and been limited by process conditions and sources of error but newer technologies can report rates up to twice per minute with much higher accuracy (referred to as real-time monitoring).   This allows process engineers to treat corrosion as another process variable that can be optimized in the system. Immediate responses to process changes allow the control of corrosion mechanisms, so they can be minimized while also maximizing production output.<ref name=\":6\">R.D. Kane, D.C. Eden, and D.A. Eden, Innovative Solutions Integrate [[Corrosion Monitoring]] with Process Control, Mater. Perform., Feb 2005, p 36\u201341.</ref>  In an ideal situation having online corrosion information that is accurate and real-time will allow conditions that cause high corrosion rates to be identified and reduced.  This is known as predictive management.\n\nMaterials methods include selecting the proper material for the application. In areas of minimal corrosion, cheap materials are preferable, but when bad corrosion can occur, more expensive but longer lasting materials should be used. Other materials methods come in the form of protective barriers between corrosive substances and the equipment metals. These can be either a lining of refractory material such as standard [[Portland cement]] or other special acid-resistant cements that are shot onto the inner surface of the vessel. Also available are thin overlays of more expensive metals that protect cheaper metal against corrosion without requiring lots of material.<ref>W.A. McGill and M.J.

The troops would then fill iron cans with refined oil and throw them toward the enemy troops, causing a fire \u2013 effectively the world's first \"[[Incendiary device|fire bomb]]\". The workshop was one of the world's earliest oil refining factories where thousands of people worked to produce Chinese oil powered weaponry.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Ancient Chinese Inventions |last=Deng |first=Yinke |year=2011 |page=41 |isbn=978-0521186926}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the nineteenth century, petroleum was known and utilized in various fashions in [[Babylon]], [[Egypt]], [[China]], [[Philippines]], [[Rome]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. However, the modern history of the petroleum industry is said to have begun in 1846 when Abraham Gessner of [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]] devised a process to produce kerosene from coal. Shortly thereafter, in 1854, [[Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]] began producing kerosene from hand-dug oil wells near the town of [[Krosno]], [[Poland]]. \n\nThe world's first systematic petroleum refinery was built in [[Ploie\u0219ti]], [[Romania]] in 1856 using the abundant oil available in Romania.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110902203529/http://www.150deanidepetrol.ro/history.html 150 Years of Oil in Romania]</ref><ref>[https://www.pbs.org/eakins/we_1844.htm WORLD EVENTS: 1844\u20131856] www.pbs.org</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2019-08-18|title=World's first oil refinery: the city of Ploiesti|url=http://www.worldrecordacademy.org/technology/worlds-first-oil-refinery-the-city-of-ploiesti-218277|date=12 November 2018|website=www.worldrecordacademy.org}}</ref>\n\nIn North America, the first oil well was drilled in 1858 by [[James Miller Williams]] in [[Oil Springs, Ontario|Oil Springs]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Habashi|first=Fathi|date=2000|title=The First Oil Well in the World|url=http://acshist.scs.illinois.edu/bulletin_open_access/v25-1/v25-1%20p64-66.pdf|journal=Bulletin for the History of Chemistry|volume=25|pages=64\u201366|via=}}</ref> In the United States, the petroleum industry began in 1859 when [[Edwin Drake]] found oil near [[Titusville, Pennsylvania|Titusville]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11368/|title=Titusville, Pennsylvania, 1896|date=1896|website=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=2013-07-16}}</ref> The industry grew slowly in the 1800s, primarily producing kerosene for oil lamps. In the early twentieth century, the introduction of the internal combustion engine and its use in automobiles created a market for gasoline that was the impetus for fairly rapid growth of the petroleum industry. The early finds of petroleum like those in Ontario and [[Pennsylvania]] were soon outstripped by large oil \"booms\" in [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]] and [[California]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Petrolia: the landscape of America's first oil boom|author=Brian Black|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8018-6317-2|edition=}}</ref>\n\n[[Samuel Kier]] established America's first oil refinery in Pittsburgh on Seventh avenue near Grant Street, in 1853.<ref name=\"The American Manufacturer and Iron World\">The American Manufacturer and Iron World [https://books.google.com/?id=lkcVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT57&dq=refinery+kier+pittsburgh, \"Greater Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, Past, Present, Future; The Pioneer Oil Refiner\"], ''Original from the New York Public Library: The American Manufacturer and Iron World.'', 1901.</ref> Polish pharmacist and inventor [[Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]] established an oil refinery in [[Jas\u0142o]], then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in [[Poland]]) in 1854.

Another close contender for the title of hosting the world's oldest oil refinery is [[Salzbergen]] in [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]]. Salzbergen's refinery was opened in 1860.\n\nAt one point, the refinery in [[Ras Tanura]], [[Saudi Arabia]] owned by [[Saudi Aramco]] was claimed to be the largest oil refinery in the world. For most of the 20th century, the largest refinery was the [[Abadan Refinery]] in [[Iran]]. This refinery suffered extensive damage during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. Since 25 December 2008, the world's largest refinery complex is the [[Jamnagar Refinery]] Complex, consisting of two refineries side by side operated by [[Reliance Industries Limited]] in Jamnagar, India with a combined production capacity of {{convert|1240000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}. [[PDVSA]]'s [[Paraguan\u00e1 Refinery Complex]] in [[Paraguan\u00e1 Peninsula]], [[Venezuela]] with a capacity of {{convert|940000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} and [[SK Energy]]'s [[Ulsan]] in [[South Korea]] with {{convert|840000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} are the second and third largest, respectively.\n\nPrior to World War II in the early 1940s, most petroleum refineries in the United States consisted simply of crude oil distillation units (often referred to as atmospheric crude oil distillation units). Some refineries also had [[vacuum distillation]] units as well as [[thermal cracking]] units such as [[visbreaker]]s (viscosity breakers, units to lower the [[viscosity]] of the oil). All of the many other refining processes discussed below were developed during the war or within a few years after the war. They became commercially available within 5 to 10 years after the war ended and the worldwide petroleum industry experienced very rapid growth. The driving force for that growth in technology and in the number and size of refineries worldwide was the growing demand for automotive gasoline and aircraft fuel.\n\nIn the United States, for various complex economic and political reasons, the construction of new refineries came to a virtual stop in about the 1980s. However, many of the existing refineries in the United States have revamped many of their units and/or constructed add-on units in order to: increase their crude oil processing capacity, increase the [[octane]] rating of their product gasoline, lower the [[sulfur]] content of their diesel fuel and home heating fuels to comply with environmental regulations and comply with environmental air pollution and water pollution requirements.[[File:ExxonMobil Baton Rouge.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.75|[[ExxonMobil]] oil refinery in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] (the fourth-largest in the [[United States]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=oil_refining#tab4|title=U.S. Energy Information Administration: Top 10 U.S. Refineries Operable Capacity|accessdate=2015-01-26}}</ref>]]\n\nThe size of oil refining market in 2017 was valued over USD 6 trillion in 2017 and is set to witness a consumption of over 100 million barrels per day (MBPD) by 2024. Oil refining market will witness an appreciable growth because of rapid industrialization and economic transformation. Changing demographics, growing population and improvement in living standards across developing nations are some of factors positively influencing the industry landscape.\n\n=== Oil refining in the United States ===\n{{main|Petroleum refining in the United States}}\nIn the 19th century, refineries in the U.S. processed crude oil primarily to recover the [[kerosene]]. There was no market for the more volatile fraction, including gasoline, which was considered waste and was often dumped directly into the nearest river. The invention of the automobile shifted the demand to gasoline and diesel, which remain the primary refined products today.\n\nToday, national and state legislation require refineries to meet stringent air and water cleanliness standards. In fact, oil companies in the U.S. perceive obtaining a permit to build a modern refinery to be so difficult and costly that no new refineries were built (though many have been expanded) in the U.S. from 1976 until 2014, when the small Dakota Prairie Refinery in North Dakota began operation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials/041113-651604-dakota-prairie-refinery-open-in-2014.htm|title=North Dakota Builds A Refinery, First In The U.S. Since '76|date=April 11, 2013|work=[[Investor's Business Daily]]|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref> More than half the refineries that existed in 1981 are now closed due to low utilization rates and accelerating mergers.<ref>[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/workshops/energymarkets/background/hazle.pdf White Paper on Refining Capacity] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527201629/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/workshops/energymarkets/background/hazle.pdf |date=2010-05-27 }}, Federal Trade Commission, April, 2007.</ref> As a result of these closures total US refinery capacity fell between 1981 and 1995, though the operating capacity stayed fairly constant in that time period at around {{convert|15000000|oilbbl/d}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=mocggus2&f=a|title=U.

In 1982 (the earliest data provided), the United States operated 301 refineries with a combined capacity of {{convert|17.9|Moilbbl|m3}} of crude oil each calendar day. In 2010, there were 149 operable U.S. refineries with a combined capacity of {{convert|17.6|Moilbbl|m3}} per calendar day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Resources/campaigns/GasPrices_2011/Documents/StatisticsDefinitions.pdf|title=2011 The U.S. Petroleum Industry: Statistics & Definitions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927143919/http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Resources/campaigns/GasPrices_2011/Documents/StatisticsDefinitions.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-27|url-status=dead|accessdate=2011-11-05}}</ref> By 2014 the number of refinery had reduced to 140 but the total capacity increased to {{convert|18.02|Moilbbl|m3}} per calendar day. Indeed, in order to reduce operating costs and depreciation, refining is operated in fewer sites but of bigger capacity.\n\nIn 2009 through 2010, as revenue streams in the oil business dried up and profitability of oil refineries fell due to lower demand for product and high reserves of supply preceding the [[Late-2000s recession|economic recession]], oil companies began to close or sell the less profitable refineries.\n\n==Operation==\nRaw or unprocessed crude oil is not generally useful in industrial applications, although \"light, sweet\" (low viscosity, low [[sulfur]]) crude oil has been used directly as a burner fuel to produce steam for the propulsion of seagoing vessels. The lighter elements, however, form explosive vapors in the fuel tanks and are therefore hazardous, especially in [[warships]]. Instead, the hundreds of different hydrocarbon molecules in crude oil are separated in a refinery into components that can be used as [[fuels]], [[lubricants]], and feedstocks in [[petrochemical]] processes that manufacture such products as [[plastic]]s, [[detergent]]s, [[solvent]]s, [[elastomer]]s, and [[fiber]]s such as [[nylon]] and [[polyesters]].\n\n[[Petroleum]] [[fossil fuels]] are burned in internal combustion engines to provide power for [[ships]], [[automobiles]], [[aircraft engine]]s, [[lawn mower]]s, [[dirt bikes]], and other machines. Different [[boiling point]]s allow the [[hydrocarbon]]s to be separated by [[distillation]]. Since the lighter liquid products are in great demand for use in internal combustion engines, a modern refinery will convert heavy hydrocarbons and lighter gaseous elements into these higher value products.\n[[File:Haifa Refinery by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|The oil refinery in [[Haifa, Israel]] is capable of processing about 9 million tons (66 million barrels) of [[crude oil]] a year.  Its two [[cooling tower]]s are landmarks of the city's skyline.]]\nOil can be used in a variety of ways because it contains hydrocarbons of varying [[molecular mass]]es, forms and lengths such as [[Alkane|paraffin]]s, [[aromatic]]s, [[naphthene]]s (or [[cycloalkane]]s), [[alkene]]s, [[diene]]s, and [[alkyne]]s. While the molecules in crude oil include different atoms such as sulfur and nitrogen, the hydrocarbons are the most common form of molecules, which are molecules of varying lengths and complexity made of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon]] [[atom]]s, and a small number of oxygen atoms. The differences in the structure of these molecules account for their varying [[Physical property|physical]] and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]], and it is this variety that makes crude oil useful in a broad range of several applications.\n\nOnce separated and purified of any contaminants and impurities, the fuel or lubricant can be sold without further processing. Smaller molecules such as [[isobutane]] and [[propylene]] or [[butylene]]s can be recombined to meet specific [[octane rating|octane]] requirements by processes such as [[alkylation]], or more commonly, [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimerization]]. The octane grade of gasoline can also be improved by [[catalytic reforming]], which involves removing [[hydrogen]] from hydrocarbons producing compounds with higher octane ratings such as [[aromatics]].  Intermediate products such as [[gasoil]]s can even be reprocessed to break a heavy, long-chained oil into a lighter short-chained one, by various forms of [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] such as [[fluid catalytic cracking]], [[thermal cracking]], and [[hydrocracking]]. The final step in gasoline production is the blending of fuels with different octane ratings, [[vapor pressure]]s, and other properties to meet product specifications. Another method for reprocessing and upgrading these intermediate products (residual oils) uses a [[wikt:devolatilization|devolatilization]]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} process to separate usable oil from the waste asphaltene material.\n\nOil refineries are large scale plants, processing about a hundred thousand to several hundred thousand [[Barrel (volume)|barrel]]s of crude oil a day.  Because of the high capacity, many of the units operate [[Continuous production|continuously]], as opposed to processing in [[Batch production|batches]], at [[steady state]] or nearly steady state for months to years.  The high capacity also makes [[process optimization]] and [[advanced process control]] very desirable.\n\n==Major products==\n[[File:Crude Oil Distillation-en.svg|thumb|right|[[Crude oil]] is separated into fractions by [[fractional distillation]]. The fractions at the top of the [[fractionating column]] have lower [[boiling point]]s than the fractions at the bottom. The heavy bottom fractions are often [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracked]] into lighter, more useful products. All of the fractions are processed further in other refining units.]]\n\n[[File:Usesofpetroleum.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A breakdown of the products made from a typical barrel of US oil.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pnp_pct_dc_nus_pct_m.htm |title=U.S. Energy Information Administration > Petroleum > Navigator > Refinery Yield |access-date=2018-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306111912/http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pnp_pct_dc_nus_pct_m.htm |archive-date=2011-03-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>]]\n\nPetroleum products are materials derived from crude oil ([[petroleum]]) as it is processed in [[oil refineries]]. The majority of petroleum is converted to petroleum products, which includes several classes of fuels.<ref>Walther W. Irion, Otto S. Neuwirth, \"Oil Refining\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a18_051}}</ref>\n\nOil refineries also produce various intermediate products such as [[hydrogen]], light hydrocarbons, [[reformate]] and [[pyrolysis gasoline]]. These are not usually transported but instead are blended or processed further on-site. Chemical plants are thus often adjacent to oil refineries or a number of further chemical processes are integrated into it. For example, light hydrocarbons are [[Steam cracking|steam-cracked]] in an [[ethylene]] plant, and the produced ethylene is polymerized to produce [[polyethene]].\n\nBecause technical reasons and environment protection demand a very low sulfur content in all but the heaviest products, it is transformed to [[hydrogen sulfide]] via catalytic [[hydrodesulfurization]] and removed from the product stream via [[amine gas treating]]. Using the [[Claus process]], hydrogen sulfide is afterwards transformed to elementary sulfur to be sold to the chemical industry. The rather large heat energy freed by this process is directly used in the other parts of the refinery. Often an electrical power plant is combined into the whole refinery process to take up the excess heat.\n\nAccording to the composition of the crude oil and depending on the demands of the market, refineries can produce different shares of petroleum products. The largest share of oil products is used as \"energy carriers\", i.e.  various grades of [[fuel oil]] and [[gasoline]].  These [[fuel]]s include or can be blended to give gasoline, [[jet fuel]], [[diesel fuel]], [[heating oil]], and heavier fuel oils.  Heavier (less [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]]) fractions can also be used to produce [[asphalt]], [[tar]], [[paraffin wax]], [[Lubricant|lubricating]] and other heavy oils.  Refineries also produce other [[chemicals]], some of which are used in [[chemical process]]es to produce [[plastics]] and other useful materials.  Since petroleum often contains a few percent [[sulfur]]-containing molecules, elemental sulfur is also often produced as a petroleum product. [[Carbon]], in the form of [[petroleum coke]], and [[hydrogen]] may also be produced as petroleum products.  The hydrogen produced is often used as an intermediate product for other oil refinery processes such as [[hydrocracking]] and [[hydrodesulfurization]].\n\nPetroleum products are usually grouped into four categories: light distillates (LPG, gasoline, naphtha), middle distillates (kerosene, jet fuel, diesel), heavy distillates and residuum (heavy fuel oil, lubricating oils, wax, asphalt). These require blending various feedstocks, mixing appropriate additives, providing short term storage, and preparation for bulk loading to trucks, barges, product ships, and railcars. This classification is based on the way crude oil is distilled and separated into fractions.<ref name=\"Leffler2\"/>\n\n*[[Gaseous fuel]] such as [[Liquified petroleum gas]] and [[propane]], stored and shipped in liquid form under pressure.\n*[[Lubricant]]s (produces light machine oils, [[motor oil]]s, and [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]]s, adding [[viscosity]] stabilizers as required), usually shipped in bulk to an offsite packaging plant.\n*[[Paraffin wax]], used in the packaging of [[frozen food]]s, among others. May be shipped in bulk to a site to prepare as packaged blocks.

For example, the [[vacuum distillation]] unit may also produce fractions that can be refined into end products such as: spindle oil used in the textile industry, light machinery oil, motor oil, and various waxes.\n\n==The crude oil distillation unit==\nThe crude oil distillation unit (CDU) is the first processing unit in virtually all petroleum refineries. The CDU distills the incoming crude oil into various fractions of different boiling ranges, each of which are then processed further in the other refinery processing units. The CDU is often referred to as the ''atmospheric distillation unit'' because it operates at slightly above atmospheric pressure.<ref name=\"Handwerk2\"/><ref name=\"Leffler2\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Kister, Henry Z.|title=Distillation Design|edition=1st |publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1992|isbn=978-0-07-034909-4}}</ref>\n\nBelow is a schematic flow diagram of a typical crude oil distillation unit. The incoming crude oil is preheated by exchanging heat with some of the hot, distilled fractions and other streams. It is then desalted to remove inorganic salts (primarily sodium chloride).\n\nFollowing the desalter, the crude oil is further heated by exchanging heat with some of the hot, distilled fractions and other streams. It is then heated in a fuel-fired furnace (fired heater) to a temperature of about 398&nbsp;\u00b0C and routed into the bottom of the distillation unit.\n\nThe cooling and condensing of the distillation tower overhead is provided partially by exchanging heat with the incoming crude oil and partially by either an air-cooled or water-cooled condenser. Additional heat is removed from the distillation column by a pumparound system as shown in the diagram below.\n\nAs shown in the flow diagram, the overhead distillate fraction from the distillation column is naphtha. The fractions removed from the side of the distillation column at various points between the column top and bottom are called ''sidecuts''. Each of the sidecuts (i.e., the kerosene, light gas oil and heavy gas oil) is cooled by exchanging heat with the incoming crude oil. All of the fractions (i.e., the overhead naphtha, the sidecuts and the bottom residue) are sent to intermediate storage tanks before being processed further.\n\n[[File:Refine.svg|center|thumb|upright=2.3|Schematic flow diagram of a typical crude oil distillation unit as used in petroleum crude oil refineries.]]\n\n==Location of petroleum refineries==\n\nA party searching for a site to construct a refinery or a chemical plant needs to consider the following issues:\n\n*The site has to be reasonably far from residential areas.\n*Infrastructure should be available for supply of raw materials and shipment of products to markets.\n*Energy to operate the plant should be available.\n*Facilities should be available for waste disposal.\n\nRefineries which use a large amount of steam and cooling water need to have an abundant source of water. Oil refineries therefore are often located nearby navigable rivers or on a sea shore, nearby a port. Such location also gives access to transportation by river or by sea. The advantages of transporting crude oil by pipeline are evident, and oil companies often transport a large volume of fuel to distribution terminals by pipeline. Pipeline may not be practical for products with small output, and rail cars, road tankers, and barges are used.\n\nPetrochemical plants and solvent manufacturing (fine fractionating) plants need spaces for further processing of a large volume of refinery products for further processing, or to mix chemical additives with a product at source rather than at blending terminals.\n\n==Safety and environment==\n[[File:BP PLANT EXPLOSION-1 lowres2.jpg|thumb|Fire-extinguishing operations after the [[Texas City Refinery explosion]].]]\nThe refining process releases a number of different chemicals into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] (see [[AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors]]) and a notable [[odor]] normally accompanies the presence of a refinery.

In the United States, there is strong pressure to prevent the development of new refineries, and no major refinery has been built in the country since [[Marathon Petroleum Company|Marathon's]] [[Garyville, Louisiana]] facility in 1976. However, many existing refineries have been expanded during that time. Environmental restrictions and pressure to prevent construction of new refineries may have also contributed to rising fuel prices in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|author=Steve Hargreaves, CNNMoney.com staff writer |url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/04/17/news/economy/refineries/index.htm |title=Behind high gas prices: The refinery crunch |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2007-04-17 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}</ref> Additionally, many refineries (more than 100 since the 1980s) have closed due to obsolescence and/or merger activity within the industry itself.\n\nEnvironmental and safety concerns mean that oil refineries are sometimes located some distance away from major urban areas. Nevertheless, there are many instances where refinery operations are close to populated areas and pose health risks. In California's [[Contra Costa County]] and [[Solano County]], a shoreline necklace of refineries, built in the early 20th century before this area was populated, and associated chemical plants are [[Housing Discrimination in the East Bay|adjacent to urban areas]] in [[Chevron Richmond Refinery|Richmond]], [[Martinez, California|Martinez]], [[Pacheco, California|Pacheco]], [[Concord, California|Concord]], [[Pittsburg, California|Pittsburg]], [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] and [[Benicia, California|Benicia]], with occasional accidental events that require \"[[shelter in place]]\" orders to the adjacent populations.

Because it leads to equipment failure, it is a primary driver for the refinery maintenance schedule. Corrosion-related direct costs in the U.S. petroleum industry as of 1996 were estimated at US $3.7 billion.<ref name=\":7\">[http://www.nace.org/uploadedFiles/Publications/ccsupp.pdf Corrosion Costs and Preventive Strategies in the United States] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113100221/http://www.nace.org/uploadedFiles/Publications/ccsupp.pdf |date=2012-11-13 }}, a publication of [[NACE International]].</ref><ref>R.D.

Moran, High Temperature Corrosion in Refinery and Petrochemical Service, Corrosion, Vol 16 (No. 12), 1960, p 593t\u2013600t.</ref> From a materials standpoint, carbon steel is used for upwards of 80 per cent of refinery components, which is beneficial due to its low cost. [[Carbon steel]] is resistant to the most common forms of corrosion, particularly from hydrocarbon impurities at temperatures below 205&nbsp;\u00b0C, but other corrosive chemicals and environments prevent its use everywhere. Common replacement materials are [[low alloy steel]]s containing [[chromium]] and [[molybdenum]], with [[stainless steels]] containing more chromium dealing with more corrosive environments. More expensive materials commonly used are [[nickel]], [[titanium]], and [[copper]] alloys. These are primarily saved for the most problematic areas where extremely high temperatures and/or very corrosive chemicals are present.<ref>E.L. Hildebrand, Materials Selection for Petroleum Refineries and Petrochemical Plants, Mater. Prot. Perform., Vol 11 (No. 7), 1972, p19\u201322.</ref>\n\nCorrosion is fought by a complex system of monitoring, preventative repairs and careful use of materials. Monitoring methods include both offline checks taken during maintenance and online monitoring. Offline checks measure corrosion after it has occurred, telling the engineer when equipment must be replaced based on the historical information they have collected. This is referred to as preventative management.\n\nOnline systems are a more modern development, and are revolutionizing the way corrosion is approached.  There are several types of online corrosion monitoring technologies such as linear polarization resistance, [[electrochemical noise]] and electrical resistance.  Online monitoring has generally had slow reporting rates in the past (minutes or hours) and been limited by process conditions and sources of error but newer technologies can report rates up to twice per minute with much higher accuracy (referred to as real-time monitoring).   This allows process engineers to treat corrosion as another process variable that can be optimized in the system. Immediate responses to process changes allow the control of corrosion mechanisms, so they can be minimized while also maximizing production output.<ref name=\":6\">R.D. Kane, D.C. Eden, and D.A. Eden, Innovative Solutions Integrate [[Corrosion Monitoring]] with Process Control, Mater. Perform., Feb 2005, p 36\u201341.</ref>  In an ideal situation having online corrosion information that is accurate and real-time will allow conditions that cause high corrosion rates to be identified and reduced.  This is known as predictive management.\n\nMaterials methods include selecting the proper material for the application. In areas of minimal corrosion, cheap materials are preferable, but when bad corrosion can occur, more expensive but longer lasting materials should be used. Other materials methods come in the form of protective barriers between corrosive substances and the equipment metals. These can be either a lining of refractory material such as standard [[Portland cement]] or other special acid-resistant cements that are shot onto the inner surface of the vessel. Also available are thin overlays of more expensive metals that protect cheaper metal against corrosion without requiring lots of material.<ref>W.A. McGill and M.J.
