They underwent many line-up changes, with vocalist and founder [[Mark E. Smith]] as the only constant member. The Fall's long-term musicians included drummers [[Paul Hanley (musician)|Paul Hanley]] and [[Karl Burns]]; guitarists [[Marc Riley]], [[Craig Scanlon]] and [[Brix Smith]]; and bassist [[Steve Hanley (musician)|Steve Hanley]], whose melodic, circular bass lines are widely credited with shaping the band's sound from early 1980s albums such as ''[[Hex Enduction Hour]]'' to the late 1990s.\nThe final and most consistent lineup in the band\u2019s history were made up of guitarist Pete Greenway, bassist Dave Spurr and drummer Keiron Melling.

Pawlett left the group shortly afterwards. ''[[Dragnet (album)|Dragnet]]'', the Fall's second album, was recorded in August 1979 at Cargo Studios, Rochdale, and was released on 26 October 1979. ''Dragnet'' signalled a sparser, more jagged feel in the Fall's music compared to ''Live at the Witch Trials''. The studio allegedly complained about the sound quality and protested against putting its name on the album sleeve, fearing it would put other artists off using the facilities.\n\n=== 1980\u20131982: Classic line-up ===\n[[File:SteveHanley1980.png|thumb|200px|Hanley, live with The Fall, 1980]]\nThe Fall released their fourth single \"Fiery Jack\", their last for Step Forward, on 13 January 1980. In March, Mike Leigh left the group and went back to the cabaret circuit. According to Leigh, the band would have to wait for weeks without work while Smith came up with new lyrics, as opposed to regular weekly gigs in cabaret. Leigh's replacement was [[Paul Hanley (musician)|Paul Hanley]], Steve Hanley's younger brother. He first played live with the Fall on Friday 21 March at Electric Ballroom, London \u2013 he was only 16 and was actually still at school. Meanwhile, the Fall quit Step Forward and signed with [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]; the first release on a new label became ''[[Totale's Turns]]'' in May 1980. This, with the exception of two tracks, was a live album documenting the band during various appearances in 1979, with Smith announcing last orders at the bar [responding to a request for the song \"Last Orders\"] and berating band members and audience throughout.\n\nIn November 1980, the Fall released their third full-length album ''[[Grotesque (album)|Grotesque (After the Gramme)]]''. Preceded by a couple of acclaimed singles \"How I Wrote 'Elastic Man'\" and \"[[Totally Wired]]\", the album went to #1 on the [[UK Indie Chart]]. It was co-produced by Rough Trade's [[Geoff Travis]] and [[Mayo Thompson]] of [[Red Krayola]] and showed a significant improvement in production, which was to continue throughout the period. Smith, however, was unhappy with [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]'s politics, which showed when ''[[Slates (EP)|Slates]]'' came out in April 1981. Intentionally made too long for a single and too short to be considered an album, it was released as a 10\" [[extended play|EP]] for a price of just 2 pounds. The Fall eventually quit Rough Trade by the end of the year, and instead signed with a small indie label Kamera.\n\nAs the Fall were going to tour America after the release of ''Slates'', Paul Hanley was denied a visa as he was too young to play American \"21 and over\" clubs, so Smith invited Karl Burns back into the group, initially as a temporary replacement. Select recordings from this tour were released in 1982 as ''[[A Part of America Therein, 1981]]''. After their return to the UK, Burns stayed in the group as a second drummer alongside Hanley. The first record to feature both Burns and Hanley became the \"Lie Dream of a Casino Soul\" single, produced by [[Richard Mazda]] and released in Australia and New Zealand in November 1981.\n\n{{listen\n| filename = The Fall Totally Wired.ogg\n| title = \"Totally Wired\"\n| description = Released as a single through Rough Trade in 1980\n| format = [[Ogg]]\n| filename2 = The Fall Leave the Capitol.ogg\n| title2 = \"Leave the Capitol\"\n| description2 = From the 1981 EP ''[[Slates (EP)|Slates]]''\n| format2 = [[Ogg]]\n| filename3 = The Fall Middle Mass.ogg\n| title3 = \"Middle Mass\"\n| description3 = From ''Slates''\n| format3 = [[Ogg]]\n| filename4 = The Fall Hip Priest.ogg\n| title4 = \"Hip Priest\"\n| description4 = From ''[[Hex Enduction Hour]]'' (1982)\n| format4 = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nOn 8 March 1982 ''[[Hex Enduction Hour]]'', also produced by Mazda, was released on Kamera Records, the Fall's seventh single (\"Look, Know\") was released 19 April 1982 on Kamera. On 27 September the ''[[Room to Live]]'' album was released on Kamera. Marc Riley was sacked at the end of the year, following several arguments, one of which resulted in a fist fight during the Australian tour. In response, Riley's band \"The Creepers\" wrote the track \"Jumper Clown\", which directly references Riley's dismissal, while also satirising Smith's dress sense.\n\n=== 1983\u20131989: Brix Smith years ===\nIn 1983, Rough Trade Records released the Fall's ninth single, \"The Man Whose Head Expanded\", and on 19 September issued the band's tenth single and double pack \"Kicker Conspiracy\". Bizarrely, in November Kamera Records released around two- to three-thousand copies of the planned 1982 single \"Marquis Cha Cha\", the release date having been put back due to Kamera's financial troubles in late 1982, making it the Fall's eleventh single issue.\n\n[[File:Brix Smith.jpg|thumb|left|[[Steve Hanley (musician)|Steve Hanley]] and [[Brix Smith]], ''[[Perverted By Language]]'' tour, Hamburg, 13 April 1984]]\nThat year Smith's American girlfriend and later wife, [[Brix Smith]] joined the band on guitar. Born Laura Elise Salenger, she was nicknamed after the track \"[[The Guns of Brixton]]\" by the Clash, a favourite song of hers. Brix's tenure in the group marked a shift towards the relatively conventional, with the songs she co-wrote often having strong [[Hook (music)|pop hooks]] and more orthodox verse-chorus-verse structures. Additionally, Brix's keen sense of fashion gradually influenced the group's members to give more attention to their clothing and styling, though her platinum blonde hair and glamorous style were somewhat at odds to the otherwise working class appearance of the Fall. Brix's first live appearance with the Fall was on 21 September 1983 at the Hellfire Club, Wakefield.\n\n''[[Perverted by Language]]'', released 5 December, was the Fall's final album for [[Rough Trade Records]], but the first to feature Brix. Also released in December was the live album ''In a Hole'', recorded during the Fall's tour of New Zealand in 1982, on [[Flying Nun Records]].\n\n{{listen\n| filename = The Fall Carry Bag Man.ogg\n| title = \"Carry Bag Man\"\n| description = From 1987's ''[[The Frenz Experiment]]''\n| format = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nThis era, a favourite period amongst many critics and fans, was marked by Brix's effort to find a wider audience for the Fall. They achieved a few modest UK hits with singles, including their versions of [[R.

''[[I Am Kurious, Oranj]]'' is notable as the fruit of a ballet project between Smith and dancer [[Michael Clark (dancer)|Michael Clark]]. [[Simon Rogers]] and later Marcia Schofield played keyboards. Paul Hanley quit during the tour supporting ''[[The Wonderful and Frightening World of The Fall]]'', and [[Simon Wolstencroft]] replaced other drummer Burns after ''This Nation's Saving Grace''. Wolstencroft becoming sole drummer shifted the group's sound; his drumming was described as \"nimble\" and \"funky\" when compared to Burns.<ref name=\"The Fallen\"/> In 2014 [[Simon Wolstencroft|Wolstencroft]] published a memoir ''You Can Drum But You Can't Hide''<ref>{{cite book |url=http://stratabooks.co.uk/book/memoir-5/you-can-drum-but-you-cant-hide/ |title=You Can Drum But You Can't Hide |first=Simon |last=Wolstencroft |isbn=9780957369078 |work=stratabooks.co.uk |access-date=6 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924110819/http://www.stratabooks.co.uk/book/memoir-5/you-can-drum-but-you-cant-hide/ |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> about his 11-year stint in the Fall.\n\n=== 1990\u20132000 ===\n\nWith Brix's departure in 1989 \u2013 both from the band and her marriage to Smith \u2013 Bramah returned briefly for 1990's ''[[Extricate]]'', the first of the Fall's three albums for [[Phonogram Records]]. In the early 1990s the band continued to have modest success on the UK chart with singles including \"[[Telephone Thing]]\" (no. 58, 1990), \"[[White Lightning (The Big Bopper song)|White Lightning]]\" (no. 56, 1990), \"[[Free Range (The Fall song)|Free Range]]\" (no. 40, 1992) and \"[[Why Are People Grudgeful]]\" (no. 43, 1993).<ref name=\"betts\"/> Bramah and Schofield were sacked in advance of 1991's ''[[Shift-Work (album)|Shift-Work]]''. Dave Bush joined on keyboards for 1992's ''[[Code: Selfish]]'', followed by the band's return to an independent record label for ''[[The Infotainment Scan]]'' (1993), ''[[Middle Class Revolt]]'' (1994), and ''[[Cerebral Caustic]]'' (1995). These albums featured varying degrees of [[electronica]] and [[Intelligent dance music|IDM]], courtesy of Bush's keyboards and computers. ''Caustic'' saw the unexpected return of Smith's ex-wife Brix, who recorded ''[[The Light User Syndrome]]'' before departing in 1996. When Dave Bush went to join [[Elastica]], Scanlon was sacked after sixteen years, an unpopular decision which Smith would later regret. In November 1994 [[Julia Nagle]] joined to help promote the release of ''[[Cerebral Caustic]]'', playing keyboards, guitars and computers. Nagle went onto contribute to ''[[The Light User Syndrome]]'' in 1996. That year also saw the start of a [[List of compilation albums by The Fall|torrent of compilations]] of live, demo and alternative versions of songs on the Fall's new label Receiver Records.\n\nIn 1994 and 1996, the Fall played at the [[Phoenix Festival]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], England \u2013 the 1996 appearance being one of much surprise to many fans as they were not scheduled to play. The next album, ''[[Levitate (The Fall album)|Levitate]]'' (1997), toyed with [[drum and bass]] and polarised opinion (long-serving drummer Simon Wolstencroft left halfway through the recording sessions, and was replaced \u2013 again \u2013 by Karl Burns). [[Seething Wells|Steven Wells]] in the ''[[NME]]'' (11 October 1997) wrote, \"Imagine pop without perimeters. Imagine rock without rules. Imagine art without the wank. If you've never heard the Fall then ''Levitate'' will be either the best or the worst record you've ever heard.\" The group was temporarily reduced to Smith and Nagle when a short US tour ended in April 1998 with onstage rows in New York, which resulted in Smith unplugging the amps during songs and lashing out at the other members, leading Burns to physically shove him. This led to the departure of Hanley (bassist of nineteen years), Burns, and guitarist Tommy Crooks. The following day, Smith was arrested and charged with assaulting Nagle in their hotel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/512609/03041999/fall.jhtml |title=VH1.com : Artists : A\u2013Z : The Fall : The Fall's Mark E.

Spencer Birtwistle was replaced by Dave Milner on drums in November 2001. September 2002 saw Elena Poulou \u2013 Smith's third wife \u2013 fill the vacant position of keyboards player, and that year [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]] named the Fall one of \"50 Bands to See Before You Die\". ''[[The Real New Fall LP (Formerly Country on the Click)|The Real New Fall LP]]'' (renamed from ''Country on the Click'' after an earlier mix of the album appeared on Internet [[file sharing]] networks) followed in 2003, with a slightly different mix and some extra tracks for the US version, after which Jim Watts was sacked (replaced by Steve Trafford) and Milner was replaced by a returning Spencer Birtwistle. In 2004 the band released its first [[50,000 Fall Fans Can't Be Wrong|career-spanning compilation]] to positive reviews in June, and a new album, [[Interim (album)|Interim]], in November.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n[[File:The Fall-.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Edinburgh, 2011]]\nIn January 2005, the Fall were the subject of a [[BBC Four]] TV documentary, ''The Fall: The Wonderful and Frightening World of Mark E Smith''.

Pawlett left the group shortly afterwards. ''[[Dragnet (album)|Dragnet]]'', the Fall's second album, was recorded in August 1979 at Cargo Studios, Rochdale, and was released on 26 October 1979. ''Dragnet'' signalled a sparser, more jagged feel in the Fall's music compared to ''Live at the Witch Trials''. The studio allegedly complained about the sound quality and protested against putting its name on the album sleeve, fearing it would put other artists off using the facilities.\n\n=== 1980\u20131982: Classic line-up ===\n[[File:SteveHanley1980.png|thumb|200px|Hanley, live with The Fall, 1980]]\nThe Fall released their fourth single \"Fiery Jack\", their last for Step Forward, on 13 January 1980. In March, Mike Leigh left the group and went back to the cabaret circuit. According to Leigh, the band would have to wait for weeks without work while Smith came up with new lyrics, as opposed to regular weekly gigs in cabaret. Leigh's replacement was [[Paul Hanley (musician)|Paul Hanley]], Steve Hanley's younger brother. He first played live with the Fall on Friday 21 March at Electric Ballroom, London \u2013 he was only 16 and was actually still at school. Meanwhile, the Fall quit Step Forward and signed with [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]; the first release on a new label became ''[[Totale's Turns]]'' in May 1980. This, with the exception of two tracks, was a live album documenting the band during various appearances in 1979, with Smith announcing last orders at the bar [responding to a request for the song \"Last Orders\"] and berating band members and audience throughout.\n\nIn November 1980, the Fall released their third full-length album ''[[Grotesque (album)|Grotesque (After the Gramme)]]''. Preceded by a couple of acclaimed singles \"How I Wrote 'Elastic Man'\" and \"[[Totally Wired]]\", the album went to #1 on the [[UK Indie Chart]]. It was co-produced by Rough Trade's [[Geoff Travis]] and [[Mayo Thompson]] of [[Red Krayola]] and showed a significant improvement in production, which was to continue throughout the period. Smith, however, was unhappy with [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]'s politics, which showed when ''[[Slates (EP)|Slates]]'' came out in April 1981. Intentionally made too long for a single and too short to be considered an album, it was released as a 10\" [[extended play|EP]] for a price of just 2 pounds. The Fall eventually quit Rough Trade by the end of the year, and instead signed with a small indie label Kamera.\n\nAs the Fall were going to tour America after the release of ''Slates'', Paul Hanley was denied a visa as he was too young to play American \"21 and over\" clubs, so Smith invited Karl Burns back into the group, initially as a temporary replacement. Select recordings from this tour were released in 1982 as ''[[A Part of America Therein, 1981]]''. After their return to the UK, Burns stayed in the group as a second drummer alongside Hanley. The first record to feature both Burns and Hanley became the \"Lie Dream of a Casino Soul\" single, produced by [[Richard Mazda]] and released in Australia and New Zealand in November 1981.\n\n{{listen\n| filename = The Fall Totally Wired.ogg\n| title = \"Totally Wired\"\n| description = Released as a single through Rough Trade in 1980\n| format = [[Ogg]]\n| filename2 = The Fall Leave the Capitol.ogg\n| title2 = \"Leave the Capitol\"\n| description2 = From the 1981 EP ''[[Slates (EP)|Slates]]''\n| format2 = [[Ogg]]\n| filename3 = The Fall Middle Mass.ogg\n| title3 = \"Middle Mass\"\n| description3 = From ''Slates''\n| format3 = [[Ogg]]\n| filename4 = The Fall Hip Priest.ogg\n| title4 = \"Hip Priest\"\n| description4 = From ''[[Hex Enduction Hour]]'' (1982)\n| format4 = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nOn 8 March 1982 ''[[Hex Enduction Hour]]'', also produced by Mazda, was released on Kamera Records, the Fall's seventh single (\"Look, Know\") was released 19 April 1982 on Kamera. On 27 September the ''[[Room to Live]]'' album was released on Kamera. Marc Riley was sacked at the end of the year, following several arguments, one of which resulted in a fist fight during the Australian tour. In response, Riley's band \"The Creepers\" wrote the track \"Jumper Clown\", which directly references Riley's dismissal, while also satirising Smith's dress sense.\n\n=== 1983\u20131989: Brix Smith years ===\nIn 1983, Rough Trade Records released the Fall's ninth single, \"The Man Whose Head Expanded\", and on 19 September issued the band's tenth single and double pack \"Kicker Conspiracy\". Bizarrely, in November Kamera Records released around two- to three-thousand copies of the planned 1982 single \"Marquis Cha Cha\", the release date having been put back due to Kamera's financial troubles in late 1982, making it the Fall's eleventh single issue.\n\n[[File:Brix Smith.jpg|thumb|left|[[Steve Hanley (musician)|Steve Hanley]] and [[Brix Smith]], ''[[Perverted By Language]]'' tour, Hamburg, 13 April 1984]]\nThat year Smith's American girlfriend and later wife, [[Brix Smith]] joined the band on guitar. Born Laura Elise Salenger, she was nicknamed after the track \"[[The Guns of Brixton]]\" by the Clash, a favourite song of hers. Brix's tenure in the group marked a shift towards the relatively conventional, with the songs she co-wrote often having strong [[Hook (music)|pop hooks]] and more orthodox verse-chorus-verse structures. Additionally, Brix's keen sense of fashion gradually influenced the group's members to give more attention to their clothing and styling, though her platinum blonde hair and glamorous style were somewhat at odds to the otherwise working class appearance of the Fall. Brix's first live appearance with the Fall was on 21 September 1983 at the Hellfire Club, Wakefield.\n\n''[[Perverted by Language]]'', released 5 December, was the Fall's final album for [[Rough Trade Records]], but the first to feature Brix. Also released in December was the live album ''In a Hole'', recorded during the Fall's tour of New Zealand in 1982, on [[Flying Nun Records]].\n\n{{listen\n| filename = The Fall Carry Bag Man.ogg\n| title = \"Carry Bag Man\"\n| description = From 1987's ''[[The Frenz Experiment]]''\n| format = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nThis era, a favourite period amongst many critics and fans, was marked by Brix's effort to find a wider audience for the Fall. They achieved a few modest UK hits with singles, including their versions of [[R.

''[[I Am Kurious, Oranj]]'' is notable as the fruit of a ballet project between Smith and dancer [[Michael Clark (dancer)|Michael Clark]]. [[Simon Rogers]] and later Marcia Schofield played keyboards. Paul Hanley quit during the tour supporting ''[[The Wonderful and Frightening World of The Fall]]'', and [[Simon Wolstencroft]] replaced other drummer Burns after ''This Nation's Saving Grace''. Wolstencroft becoming sole drummer shifted the group's sound; his drumming was described as \"nimble\" and \"funky\" when compared to Burns.<ref name=\"The Fallen\"/> In 2014 [[Simon Wolstencroft|Wolstencroft]] published a memoir ''You Can Drum But You Can't Hide''<ref>{{cite book |url=http://stratabooks.co.uk/book/memoir-5/you-can-drum-but-you-cant-hide/ |title=You Can Drum But You Can't Hide |first=Simon |last=Wolstencroft |isbn=9780957369078 |work=stratabooks.co.uk |access-date=6 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924110819/http://www.stratabooks.co.uk/book/memoir-5/you-can-drum-but-you-cant-hide/ |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> about his 11-year stint in the Fall.\n\n=== 1990\u20132000 ===\n\nWith Brix's departure in 1989 \u2013 both from the band and her marriage to Smith \u2013 Bramah returned briefly for 1990's ''[[Extricate]]'', the first of the Fall's three albums for [[Phonogram Records]]. In the early 1990s the band continued to have modest success on the UK chart with singles including \"[[Telephone Thing]]\" (no. 58, 1990), \"[[White Lightning (The Big Bopper song)|White Lightning]]\" (no. 56, 1990), \"[[Free Range (The Fall song)|Free Range]]\" (no. 40, 1992) and \"[[Why Are People Grudgeful]]\" (no. 43, 1993).<ref name=\"betts\"/> Bramah and Schofield were sacked in advance of 1991's ''[[Shift-Work (album)|Shift-Work]]''. Dave Bush joined on keyboards for 1992's ''[[Code: Selfish]]'', followed by the band's return to an independent record label for ''[[The Infotainment Scan]]'' (1993), ''[[Middle Class Revolt]]'' (1994), and ''[[Cerebral Caustic]]'' (1995). These albums featured varying degrees of [[electronica]] and [[Intelligent dance music|IDM]], courtesy of Bush's keyboards and computers. ''Caustic'' saw the unexpected return of Smith's ex-wife Brix, who recorded ''[[The Light User Syndrome]]'' before departing in 1996. When Dave Bush went to join [[Elastica]], Scanlon was sacked after sixteen years, an unpopular decision which Smith would later regret. In November 1994 [[Julia Nagle]] joined to help promote the release of ''[[Cerebral Caustic]]'', playing keyboards, guitars and computers. Nagle went onto contribute to ''[[The Light User Syndrome]]'' in 1996. That year also saw the start of a [[List of compilation albums by The Fall|torrent of compilations]] of live, demo and alternative versions of songs on the Fall's new label Receiver Records.\n\nIn 1994 and 1996, the Fall played at the [[Phoenix Festival]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], England \u2013 the 1996 appearance being one of much surprise to many fans as they were not scheduled to play. The next album, ''[[Levitate (The Fall album)|Levitate]]'' (1997), toyed with [[drum and bass]] and polarised opinion (long-serving drummer Simon Wolstencroft left halfway through the recording sessions, and was replaced \u2013 again \u2013 by Karl Burns). [[Seething Wells|Steven Wells]] in the ''[[NME]]'' (11 October 1997) wrote, \"Imagine pop without perimeters. Imagine rock without rules. Imagine art without the wank. If you've never heard the Fall then ''Levitate'' will be either the best or the worst record you've ever heard.\" The group was temporarily reduced to Smith and Nagle when a short US tour ended in April 1998 with onstage rows in New York, which resulted in Smith unplugging the amps during songs and lashing out at the other members, leading Burns to physically shove him. This led to the departure of Hanley (bassist of nineteen years), Burns, and guitarist Tommy Crooks. The following day, Smith was arrested and charged with assaulting Nagle in their hotel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/512609/03041999/fall.jhtml |title=VH1.com : Artists : A\u2013Z : The Fall : The Fall's Mark E.

Spencer Birtwistle was replaced by Dave Milner on drums in November 2001. September 2002 saw Elena Poulou \u2013 Smith's third wife \u2013 fill the vacant position of keyboards player, and that year [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]] named the Fall one of \"50 Bands to See Before You Die\". ''[[The Real New Fall LP (Formerly Country on the Click)|The Real New Fall LP]]'' (renamed from ''Country on the Click'' after an earlier mix of the album appeared on Internet [[file sharing]] networks) followed in 2003, with a slightly different mix and some extra tracks for the US version, after which Jim Watts was sacked (replaced by Steve Trafford) and Milner was replaced by a returning Spencer Birtwistle. In 2004 the band released its first [[50,000 Fall Fans Can't Be Wrong|career-spanning compilation]] to positive reviews in June, and a new album, [[Interim (album)|Interim]], in November.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n[[File:The Fall-.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Edinburgh, 2011]]\nIn January 2005, the Fall were the subject of a [[BBC Four]] TV documentary, ''The Fall: The Wonderful and Frightening World of Mark E Smith''.
