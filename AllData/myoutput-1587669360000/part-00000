{"title_page": "Interpretations of quantum mechanics", "text_new": "{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Interpretations}}\nAn '''interpretation of quantum mechanics''' is an attempt to explain how the mathematical theory of [[quantum mechanics]] \"corresponds\" to [[reality]]. Although quantum mechanics has held up to rigorous and extremely precise tests in an extraordinarily broad range of experiments (not one prediction from quantum mechanics is found to be contradicted by experiments), there exist a number of contending schools of thought over their interpretation.  These views on interpretation differ on such fundamental questions as whether quantum mechanics is [[determinism|deterministic]] or [[stochastic|stochastic]], which elements of quantum mechanics can be considered real, and what is the nature of measurement, among other matters.\n\nDespite nearly a century of debate and experiment, no consensus has been reached among physicists and [[Philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]] concerning which interpretation best \"represents\" reality.<ref>\nMurray Gell-Mann - Quantum Mechanics Interpretations - Feynman Sum over Histories - EPR Bertlemann's\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-OFP5tNtMY\nRichard P Feynman: Quantum Mechanical View of Reality 1 (Part 1)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72us6pnbEvE\n</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schlosshauer|first=Maximilian|last2=Kofler|first2=Johannes|last3=Zeilinger|first3=Anton|date=2013-08-01|title=A snapshot of foundational attitudes toward quantum mechanics|url=|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|volume=44|issue=3|pages=222\u2013230|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2013.04.004|issn=1355-2198|arxiv=1301.1069|bibcode=2013SHPMP..44..222S}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{multiple image\n| header            = Influential figures in the interpretation of quantum mechanics\n| header_align      = center<!-- left/right/ -->\n| header_background = #CCCCFF\n|align=right\n|direction=horizontal\n|image1=Erwin Schrodinger2.jpg\n|caption1=[[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]]\n|width1=150\n|image2=Max Born.jpg\n|caption2=[[Max Born|Born]]\n|width2=147\n|image3=Niels Bohr.jpg\n|caption3=[[Niels Bohr|Bohr]]\n|width3=135\n}}\nThe definition of quantum theorists' terms, such as ''[[wave function]]s'' and ''[[matrix mechanics]]'', progressed through many stages.

The main conclusion of the authors is that \"the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] still reigns supreme\", receiving the most votes in their poll (42%), besides the rise to mainstream notability of the [[many-worlds interpretations]]:\n:\"The  Copenhagen  interpretation  still  reigns  supreme  here,  especially  if  we  lump  it  together  with intellectual offsprings such as [[quantum information|information-based interpretations]] and the [[Quantum Bayesian]] interpretation.  In Tegmark's poll, the Everett interpretation received 17% of the vote, which is similar to the number of votes (18%) in our poll.\"\n\n== Nature ==\nMore or less, all interpretations of quantum mechanics share two qualities:\n# They interpret a ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]''\u2014a set of equations and principles to generate predictions via input of initial conditions\n# They interpret a ''[[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]''\u2014a set of observations, including those obtained by empirical research and those obtained informally, such as humans' experience of an unequivocal world\nTwo qualities vary among interpretations:\n# [[Ontology]]\u2014claims about what things, such as categories and entities, ''exist'' in the world\n# [[Epistemology]]\u2014claims about the possibility, scope, and means toward relevant ''knowledge'' of the world\n\nIn [[philosophy of science]], the distinction of knowledge versus reality is termed ''[[epistemic]]'' versus ''[[ontic]]''.  A general law is a ''regularity'' of outcomes (epistemic), whereas a causal mechanism may ''regulate'' the outcomes (ontic).  A [[phenomenon]] can receive interpretation either ontic or epistemic.  For instance, [[indeterminism]] may be attributed to limitations of human observation and perception (epistemic), or may be explained as a real existing ''maybe'' encoded in the universe (ontic).  Confusing the epistemic with the ontic, like if one were to presume that a general law actually \"governs\" outcomes\u2014and that the statement of a regularity has the role of a causal mechanism\u2014is a [[category mistake]].\n\nIn a broad sense, scientific theory can be viewed as offering [[scientific realism]]\u2014approximately true description or explanation of the natural world\u2014or might be perceived with antirealism.  A realist stance seeks the epistemic and the ontic, whereas an antirealist stance seeks epistemic but not the ontic.  In the 20th century's first half, antirealism was mainly [[logical positivism]], which sought to exclude unobservable aspects of reality from scientific theory.\n\n{{anchor|shutup}}Since the 1950s, antirealism is more modest, usually [[instrumentalism]], permitting talk of unobservable aspects, but ultimately discarding the very question of realism and posing scientific theory as a tool to help humans make predictions, not to attain [[metaphysical]] understanding of the world.  The instrumentalist view is carried by the famous quote of [[David Mermin]], \"Shut up and calculate\", often misattributed to [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>For a discussion of the provenance of the phrase \"shut up and calculate\", see {{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1768652|title=Could Feynman have said this?|journal=[[Physics Today]]|volume=57|issue=5|pages=10\u201311|year=2004|last1=Mermin|first1=N.

An example is [[Bohmian mechanics]], whose empirical equivalence with the three standard formalisms\u2014[[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]]'s [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]], and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]'s [[path integral formalism]]\u2014has been demonstrated.\n\n== Interpretive challenges ==\n\n# Abstract, mathematical nature of [[quantum field theories]]: the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical structure of quantum mechanics]] is mathematically abstract without clear interpretation of its quantities.\n# Existence of apparently [[quantum indeterminacy|indeterministic]] and irreversible processes: in [[classical field theory]], a physical property at a given location in the field is readily derived.  In most mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, measurement is given a special role in the theory, as it is the sole process that can cause a nonunitary, irreversible evolution of the state. \n# Role of the [[observer (quantum physics)|observer]] in determining outcomes: the [[Copenhagen Interpretation]] implies that the wavefunction is a calculational tool, and represents reality only immediately after a measurement, perhaps performed by an observer; Everettian interpretations grant that all the possibilities can be real, and that the process of measurement-type interactions cause an effective branching process.<ref>Guido Bacciagaluppi, \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/qm-decoherence The role of decoherence in quantum mechanics]\", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2012), Edward N Zalta, ed.</ref>\n# [[Quantum entanglement|Classically unexpected correlations]] between remote objects: [[Quantum entanglement|entangled quantum systems]], as illustrated in the [[EPR paradox]], obey statistics that seem to [[action at a distance (physics)|violate]] [[Principle of locality|principles of local causality]].<ref>''La nouvelle cuisine'', by John S Bell, last article of Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, second edition.</ref>\n# Complementarity of proffered descriptions: [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] holds that no set of classical physical concepts can simultaneously refer to all properties of a quantum system.  For instance, wave description ''A'' and particulate description ''B'' can each describe quantum system ''S'', but not simultaneously. This implies the composition of physical properties of ''S'' does not obey the rules of classical [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] when using propositional connectives (see \"[[Quantum logic]]\").  Like contextuality, the \"origin of complementarity lies in the [[non-commutativity]] of operators\" that describe quantum objects (Omn\u00e8s 1999).\n# Rapidly rising intricacy, far exceeding humans' present calculational capacity, as a system's size increases: since the state space of a quantum system is exponential in the number of subsystems, it is difficult to derive classical approximations.\n# [[Quantum contextuality|Contextual]] behaviour of systems locally: [[Quantum contextuality]] demonstrates that classical intuitions in which properties of a system hold definite values, independent of the manner of their measurement, fails even for local systems. Also, physical principles such as [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz's Principle of the identity of indiscernibles]] no longer apply in the quantum domain, signalling that most classical intuitions may be incorrect about the quantum world.\n\n== Influential Interpretations ==\n\n=== Other interpretations ===\n{{Main|Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\nAs well as the mainstream interpretations discussed below, a number of other interpretations have been proposed which have not made a significant scientific impact for whatever reason. These range from proposals by mainstream physicists to the more [[occult]] ideas of [[quantum mysticism]].\n\n=== The EPR Paradox ===\nThe current usage of realism and completeness originated in the 1935 paper in which Einstein and others proposed the [[EPR paradox]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Einstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Podolsky | first2 = B. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = N. | year = 1935 | title = Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete? | url =http://cds.cern.ch/record/405662/files/PhysRev.47.777.pdf | journal = Phys.

They characterised element of reality as a quantity whose value can be predicted with certainty before measuring or otherwise disturbing it, and defined a complete physical theory as one in which every element of physical reality is accounted for by the theory. In a semantic view of interpretation, an interpretation is complete if every element of the interpreting structure is present in the mathematics. Realism is also a property of each of the elements of the maths; an element is real if it corresponds to something in the interpreting structure. For example, in some interpretations of quantum mechanics (such as the many-worlds interpretation) the ket vector associated to the system state is said to correspond to an element of physical reality, while in other interpretations it is not.\n\nDeterminism is a property characterizing state changes due to the passage of time, namely that the state at a future instant is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the state in the present (see [[time evolution]]). It may not always be clear whether a particular interpretation is deterministic or not, as there may not be a clear choice of a time parameter. Moreover, a given theory may have two interpretations, one of which is deterministic and the other not.\n\nLocal realism has two aspects:\n* The value returned by a measurement corresponds to the value of some function in the state space. In other words, that value is an element of reality;\n* The effects of measurement have a propagation speed not exceeding some universal limit (e.g. the speed of light). In order for this to make sense, measurement operations in the interpreting structure must be localized.\n\nA precise formulation of local realism in terms of a [[local hidden-variable theory]] was proposed by [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]].\n\n[[Bell's theorem]], combined with experimental testing, restricts the kinds of properties a quantum theory can have, the primary implication being that quantum mechanics cannot satisfy both the [[locality principle|principle of locality]] and [[counterfactual definiteness]].\n\nRegardless of Einstein's concerns about interpretation issues, Dirac and other quantum notables embraced the technical advances of the new theory while devoting little or no attention to interpretational aspects.\n\n=== Copenhagen interpretation ===\n{{Main|Copenhagen interpretation}}\n\nThe [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is the \"standard\" interpretation of quantum mechanics formulated by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] while collaborating in Copenhagen around 1927. Bohr and Heisenberg extended the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction proposed originally by Max Born. The Copenhagen interpretation rejects questions like \"where was the particle before I measured its position?\" as meaningless. The measurement process randomly picks out exactly one of the many possibilities allowed for by the state's wave function in a manner consistent with the well-defined probabilities that are assigned to each possible state. According to the interpretation, the interaction of an observer or apparatus that is external to the quantum system is the cause of wave function collapse, thus according to [[Paul Davies]], \"reality is in the observations, not in the electron\".<ref>http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Heisenberg,Werner/Heisenberg,%20Werner%20-%20Physics%20and%20philosophy.pdf</ref> In general, after a measurement (click of a Geiger counter or a trajectory in a spark or bubble chamber) it ceases to be relevant unless subsequent experimental observations can be performed.\n\n=== Quantum information theories ===\n[[Quantum information]]al approaches<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.quantum.at/fileadmin/links/newscientist/bit.html\n | title=In the beginning was the bit\n | work=New Scientist\n | date=2001-02-17\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref> have attracted growing support.<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.dailycamera.com/science-columnists/ci_22444536/kate-becker-quantum-physics-has-been-rankling-scientists\n | title=Quantum physics has been rankling scientists for decades\n | work=Boulder Daily Camera\n | author=Kate Becker\n | date=2013-01-25\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  They subdivide into two kinds.<ref>[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~bras2317/iii_2.pdf Information, Immaterialism, Instrumentalism: Old and New in Quantum Information.] Christopher G.

Cit.: \"Let us call the thought that information might be the basic category from which all else flows informational immaterialism.\"</ref>\n* Interpretations where quantum mechanics is said to describe an observer's knowledge of the world, rather than the world itself. This approach has some similarity with Bohr's thinking.<ref>\"Physics concerns what we can say about nature\". (Niels Bohr, quoted in Petersen, A. (1963). The philosophy of Niels Bohr. ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', 19(7):8\u201314.)</ref> Collapse (also known as reduction) is often interpreted as an observer acquiring information from a measurement, rather than as an objective event. These approaches have been appraised as similar to [[instrumentalism]].\n<blockquote>\nThe state is not an objective property of an individual system but is that information, obtained from a knowledge of how a system was prepared, which can be used for making predictions about future measurements.\n...A quantum mechanical state being a summary of the observer's information about an individual physical system changes both by dynamical laws, and whenever the observer acquires new information about the system through the process of measurement. The existence of two laws for the evolution of the state vector...becomes problematical only if it is believed that the state vector is an objective property of the system...The \"reduction of the wavepacket\" does take place in the consciousness of the observer, not because of any unique physical process which takes place there, but only because the state is a construct of the observer and not an objective property of the physical system.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hartle | first1 = J.

Consequently, if quantum mechanics is to be a complete theory, relational quantum mechanics argues that the notion of \"state\" describes not the observed system itself, but the relationship, or correlation, between the system and its observer(s).  The [[Quantum state vector|state vector]] of conventional quantum mechanics becomes a description of the correlation of some ''degrees of freedom'' in the observer, with respect to the observed system.  However, it is held by relational quantum mechanics that this applies to all physical objects, whether or not they are conscious or macroscopic. Any \"measurement event\" is seen simply as an ordinary physical interaction, an establishment of the sort of correlation discussed above.  Thus the physical content of the theory has to do not with objects themselves, but the relations between them.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-relational/\n |title=Relational Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\n |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu\n |date=\n |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref><ref>For more information, see {{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02302261 |author=Carlo Rovelli |year=1996 |title=Relational Quantum Mechanics |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1637\u20131678 |arxiv=quant-ph/9609002|bibcode = 1996IJTP...35.1637R |authorlink= Carlo Rovelli }}</ref>\n\nAn independent [[Relational approach to quantum physics|relational approach to quantum mechanics]] was developed in analogy with David Bohm's elucidation of special relativity,<ref>David Bohm, ''The Special Theory of Relativity'', Benjamin, New York, 1965</ref> in which a detection event is regarded as establishing a relationship between the quantized field and the detector.

The phenomena associated with measurement are claimed to be explained by [[Quantum decoherence|decoherence]], which occurs when states interact with the environment producing [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]], repeatedly \"splitting\" the universe into mutually unobservable alternate histories\u2014effectively distinct universes within a greater [[multiverse]].\n\n=== Consistent histories ===\n{{Main|Consistent histories}}\n\nThe [[consistent histories]] interpretation generalizes the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and attempts to provide a natural interpretation of [[quantum cosmology]]. The theory is based on a consistency criterion that allows the history of a system to be described so that the probabilities for each history obey the additive rules of classical probability. It is claimed to be [[consistent]] with the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]].\n\nAccording to this interpretation, the purpose of a quantum-mechanical theory is to predict the relative probabilities of various alternative histories (for example, of a particle).\n\n=== Ensemble interpretation ===\n{{Main|Ensemble interpretation}}\n\nThe [[ensemble interpretation]], also called the statistical interpretation, can be viewed as a minimalist interpretation. That is, it claims to make the fewest assumptions associated with the standard mathematics. It takes the statistical interpretation of Born to the fullest extent. The interpretation states that the wave function does not apply to an individual system{{spaced ndash}}for example, a single particle{{spaced ndash}}but is an abstract statistical quantity that only applies to an ensemble (a vast multitude) of similarly prepared systems or particles.

Particles, which always have positions, are guided by the wavefunction.  The wavefunction evolves according to the [[Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation]], and the wavefunction never collapses. The theory takes place in a single space-time, is [[Principle of locality|non-local]], and is deterministic. The simultaneous determination of a particle's position and velocity is subject to the usual [[uncertainty principle]] constraint. The theory is considered to be a [[hidden-variable theory]], and by embracing non-locality it satisfies Bell's inequality. The [[measurement problem]] is resolved, since the particles have definite positions at all times.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Maudlin | first1 = T. | year = 1995 | title = Why Bohm's Theory Solves the Measurement Problem | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/557e16347518003aa208a20ed704220e5706fc6d| journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 479\u2013483 | doi=10.1086/289879}}</ref> Collapse is explained as [[wikt:phenomenology|phenomenological]].<ref name=\"CushingFine2013\">{{cite arXiv |last1=Durr |first1=D. |last2=Zanghi |first2=N. |last3=Goldstein |first3=S.|eprint=quant-ph/9511016 |title=''Bohmian Mechanics as the Foundation of Quantum Mechanics ''|date=Nov 14, 1995 }} Also published in {{cite book|author1=J.T.

It was proposed in 2003 by [[Wojciech Zurek]] and a group of collaborators including Ollivier, Poulin, Paz and Blume-Kohout. The development of the theory is due to the integration of a number of Zurek\u2019s research topics pursued over the course of twenty-five years including: [[pointer state]]s, [[einselection]] and [[decoherence]].\n\n=== Transactional interpretation ===\n{{Main|Transactional interpretation}}\nThe [[transactional interpretation]] of quantum mechanics (TIQM) by [[John G. Cramer]] is an interpretation of quantum mechanics inspired by the [[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/qm_nl.html\n |title       = Quantum Nocality \u2013 Cramer\n |publisher   = Npl.washington.edu\n |accessdate  = 2011-01-24\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101229074514/http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/qm_nl.html\n |archivedate = 2010-12-29\n}}</ref> It describes the collapse of the wave function as resulting from a time-symmetric transaction between a possibility wave from the source to the receiver (the wave function) and a possibility wave from the receiver to source (the complex conjugate of the wave function).  This interpretation of quantum mechanics is unique in that it not only views the wave function as a real entity, but the complex conjugate of the wave function, which appears in the Born rule for calculating the expected value for an observable, as also real.\n\n=== Stochastic mechanics ===\n{{Main|Stochastic interpretation}}\nAn entirely classical derivation and interpretation of Schr\u00f6dinger's wave equation by analogy with [[Brownian motion]] was suggested by [[Princeton University]] professor [[Edward Nelson]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = E | year = 1966 | title = Derivation of the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation from Newtonian Mechanics | url = | journal = Phys.

In objective theories, collapse occurs either randomly (\"spontaneous localization\") or when some physical threshold is reached, with observers having no special role.  Thus, objective-collapse theories are realistic, indeterministic, no-hidden-variables theories.  Standard quantum mechanics does not specify any mechanism of collapse; QM would need to be extended if objective collapse is correct. The requirement for an extension to QM means that objective collapse is more of a theory than an interpretation.

This research area and its name originated in the 1936 paper by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]], who attempted to reconcile some of the apparent inconsistencies of classical boolean logic with the facts related to measurement and observation in quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Modal interpretations of quantum theory ===\nModal interpretations of quantum mechanics were first conceived of in 1972 by B. van Fraassen, in his paper \"A formal approach to the philosophy of science.\"  However, this term now is used to describe a larger set of models that grew out of this approach.

This creates [[retrocausality]]: events in the future can affect ones in the past, exactly as events in the past can affect ones in the future.  In these theories, a single measurement cannot fully determine the state of a system (making them a type of [[hidden-variables theory]]), but given two measurements performed at different times, it is possible to calculate the exact state of the system at all intermediate times.  The collapse of the wavefunction is therefore not a physical change to the system, just a change in our knowledge of it due to the second measurement.  Similarly, they explain entanglement as not being a true physical state but just an illusion created by ignoring retrocausality.  The point where two particles appear to \"become entangled\" is simply a point where each particle is being influenced by events that occur to the other particle in the future.\n\nNot all advocates of time-symmetric causality favour modifying the unitary dynamics of standard quantum mechanics. Thus a leading exponent of the two-state vector formalism, Lev Vaidman, states that the two-state vector formalism dovetails well with [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]].<ref>Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: ''The Two-State Vector Formalism of Quantum Mechanics: an Updated Review''.

It also has some resemblance to hidden-variable theories and the ensemble interpretation: particles in BST have multiple well defined trajectories at the microscopic level. These can only be treated stochastically at a coarse grained level, in line with the ensemble interpretation.<ref name=\"Sharlow\">[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3781/1/what_branching_spacetime_might_do.pdf Sharlow, Mark; \"What Branching Spacetime might do for Physics\"] p.2</ref>\n\n== Comparisons ==\nThe most common interpretations are summarized in the table below.

To that extent, the physical theory stands, and is consistent with itself and with reality; difficulties arise only when one attempts to \"interpret\" the theory.  Nevertheless, designing experiments which would test the various interpretations is the subject of active research.\n\nMost of these interpretations have variants.

The main conclusion of the authors is that \"the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] still reigns supreme\", receiving the most votes in their poll (42%), besides the rise to mainstream notability of the [[many-worlds interpretations]]:\n:\"The  Copenhagen  interpretation  still  reigns  supreme  here,  especially  if  we  lump  it  together  with intellectual offsprings such as [[quantum information|information-based interpretations]] and the [[Quantum Bayesian]] interpretation.  In Tegmark's poll, the Everett interpretation received 17% of the vote, which is similar to the number of votes (18%) in our poll.\"\n\n== Nature ==\nMore or less, all interpretations of quantum mechanics share two qualities:\n# They interpret a ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]''\u2014a set of equations and principles to generate predictions via input of initial conditions\n# They interpret a ''[[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]''\u2014a set of observations, including those obtained by empirical research and those obtained informally, such as humans' experience of an unequivocal world\nTwo qualities vary among interpretations:\n# [[Ontology]]\u2014claims about what things, such as categories and entities, ''exist'' in the world\n# [[Epistemology]]\u2014claims about the possibility, scope, and means toward relevant ''knowledge'' of the world\n\nIn [[philosophy of science]], the distinction of knowledge versus reality is termed ''[[epistemic]]'' versus ''[[ontic]]''.  A general law is a ''regularity'' of outcomes (epistemic), whereas a causal mechanism may ''regulate'' the outcomes (ontic).  A [[phenomenon]] can receive interpretation either ontic or epistemic.  For instance, [[indeterminism]] may be attributed to limitations of human observation and perception (epistemic), or may be explained as a real existing ''maybe'' encoded in the universe (ontic).  Confusing the epistemic with the ontic, like if one were to presume that a general law actually \"governs\" outcomes\u2014and that the statement of a regularity has the role of a causal mechanism\u2014is a [[category mistake]].\n\nIn a broad sense, scientific theory can be viewed as offering [[scientific realism]]\u2014approximately true description or explanation of the natural world\u2014or might be perceived with antirealism.  A realist stance seeks the epistemic and the ontic, whereas an antirealist stance seeks epistemic but not the ontic.  In the 20th century's first half, antirealism was mainly [[logical positivism]], which sought to exclude unobservable aspects of reality from scientific theory.\n\n{{anchor|shutup}}Since the 1950s, antirealism is more modest, usually [[instrumentalism]], permitting talk of unobservable aspects, but ultimately discarding the very question of realism and posing scientific theory as a tool to help humans make predictions, not to attain [[metaphysical]] understanding of the world.  The instrumentalist view is carried by the famous quote of [[David Mermin]], \"Shut up and calculate\", often misattributed to [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>For a discussion of the provenance of the phrase \"shut up and calculate\", see {{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1768652|title=Could Feynman have said this?|journal=[[Physics Today]]|volume=57|issue=5|pages=10\u201311|year=2004|last1=Mermin|first1=N.

An example is [[Bohmian mechanics]], whose empirical equivalence with the three standard formalisms\u2014[[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]]'s [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]], and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]'s [[path integral formalism]]\u2014has been demonstrated.\n\n== Interpretive challenges ==\n\n# Abstract, mathematical nature of [[quantum field theories]]: the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical structure of quantum mechanics]] is mathematically abstract without clear interpretation of its quantities.\n# Existence of apparently [[quantum indeterminacy|indeterministic]] and irreversible processes: in [[classical field theory]], a physical property at a given location in the field is readily derived.  In most mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, measurement is given a special role in the theory, as it is the sole process that can cause a nonunitary, irreversible evolution of the state. \n# Role of the [[observer (quantum physics)|observer]] in determining outcomes: the [[Copenhagen Interpretation]] implies that the wavefunction is a calculational tool, and represents reality only immediately after a measurement, perhaps performed by an observer; Everettian interpretations grant that all the possibilities can be real, and that the process of measurement-type interactions cause an effective branching process.<ref>Guido Bacciagaluppi, \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/qm-decoherence The role of decoherence in quantum mechanics]\", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2012), Edward N Zalta, ed.</ref>\n# [[Quantum entanglement|Classically unexpected correlations]] between remote objects: [[Quantum entanglement|entangled quantum systems]], as illustrated in the [[EPR paradox]], obey statistics that seem to [[action at a distance (physics)|violate]] [[Principle of locality|principles of local causality]].<ref>''La nouvelle cuisine'', by John S Bell, last article of Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, second edition.</ref>\n# Complementarity of proffered descriptions: [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] holds that no set of classical physical concepts can simultaneously refer to all properties of a quantum system.  For instance, wave description ''A'' and particulate description ''B'' can each describe quantum system ''S'', but not simultaneously. This implies the composition of physical properties of ''S'' does not obey the rules of classical [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] when using propositional connectives (see \"[[Quantum logic]]\").  Like contextuality, the \"origin of complementarity lies in the [[non-commutativity]] of operators\" that describe quantum objects (Omn\u00e8s 1999).\n# Rapidly rising intricacy, far exceeding humans' present calculational capacity, as a system's size increases: since the state space of a quantum system is exponential in the number of subsystems, it is difficult to derive classical approximations.\n# [[Quantum contextuality|Contextual]] behaviour of systems locally: [[Quantum contextuality]] demonstrates that classical intuitions in which properties of a system hold definite values, independent of the manner of their measurement, fails even for local systems. Also, physical principles such as [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz's Principle of the identity of indiscernibles]] no longer apply in the quantum domain, signalling that most classical intuitions may be incorrect about the quantum world.\n\n== Influential Interpretations ==\n\n=== Other interpretations ===\n{{Main|Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\nAs well as the mainstream interpretations discussed below, a number of other interpretations have been proposed which have not made a significant scientific impact for whatever reason. These range from proposals by mainstream physicists to the more [[occult]] ideas of [[quantum mysticism]].\n\n=== The EPR Paradox ===\nThe current usage of realism and completeness originated in the 1935 paper in which Einstein and others proposed the [[EPR paradox]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Einstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Podolsky | first2 = B. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = N. | year = 1935 | title = Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete? | url =http://cds.cern.ch/record/405662/files/PhysRev.47.777.pdf | journal = Phys.

They characterised element of reality as a quantity whose value can be predicted with certainty before measuring or otherwise disturbing it, and defined a complete physical theory as one in which every element of physical reality is accounted for by the theory. In a semantic view of interpretation, an interpretation is complete if every element of the interpreting structure is present in the mathematics. Realism is also a property of each of the elements of the maths; an element is real if it corresponds to something in the interpreting structure. For example, in some interpretations of quantum mechanics (such as the many-worlds interpretation) the ket vector associated to the system state is said to correspond to an element of physical reality, while in other interpretations it is not.\n\nDeterminism is a property characterizing state changes due to the passage of time, namely that the state at a future instant is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the state in the present (see [[time evolution]]). It may not always be clear whether a particular interpretation is deterministic or not, as there may not be a clear choice of a time parameter. Moreover, a given theory may have two interpretations, one of which is deterministic and the other not.\n\nLocal realism has two aspects:\n* The value returned by a measurement corresponds to the value of some function in the state space. In other words, that value is an element of reality;\n* The effects of measurement have a propagation speed not exceeding some universal limit (e.g. the speed of light). In order for this to make sense, measurement operations in the interpreting structure must be localized.\n\nA precise formulation of local realism in terms of a [[local hidden-variable theory]] was proposed by [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]].\n\n[[Bell's theorem]], combined with experimental testing, restricts the kinds of properties a quantum theory can have, the primary implication being that quantum mechanics cannot satisfy both the [[locality principle|principle of locality]] and [[counterfactual definiteness]].\n\nRegardless of Einstein's concerns about interpretation issues, Dirac and other quantum notables embraced the technical advances of the new theory while devoting little or no attention to interpretational aspects.\n\n=== Copenhagen interpretation ===\n{{Main|Copenhagen interpretation}}\n\nThe [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is the \"standard\" interpretation of quantum mechanics formulated by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] while collaborating in Copenhagen around 1927. Bohr and Heisenberg extended the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction proposed originally by Max Born. The Copenhagen interpretation rejects questions like \"where was the particle before I measured its position?\" as meaningless. The measurement process randomly picks out exactly one of the many possibilities allowed for by the state's wave function in a manner consistent with the well-defined probabilities that are assigned to each possible state. According to the interpretation, the interaction of an observer or apparatus that is external to the quantum system is the cause of wave function collapse, thus according to [[Paul Davies]], \"reality is in the observations, not in the electron\".<ref>http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Heisenberg,Werner/Heisenberg,%20Werner%20-%20Physics%20and%20philosophy.pdf</ref> In general, after a measurement (click of a Geiger counter or a trajectory in a spark or bubble chamber) it ceases to be relevant unless subsequent experimental observations can be performed.\n\n=== Quantum information theories ===\n[[Quantum information]]al approaches<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.quantum.at/fileadmin/links/newscientist/bit.html\n | title=In the beginning was the bit\n | work=New Scientist\n | date=2001-02-17\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref> have attracted growing support.<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.dailycamera.com/science-columnists/ci_22444536/kate-becker-quantum-physics-has-been-rankling-scientists\n | title=Quantum physics has been rankling scientists for decades\n | work=Boulder Daily Camera\n | author=Kate Becker\n | date=2013-01-25\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  They subdivide into two kinds.<ref>[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~bras2317/iii_2.pdf Information, Immaterialism, Instrumentalism: Old and New in Quantum Information.] Christopher G.

The existence of two laws for the evolution of the state vector...becomes problematical only if it is believed that the state vector is an objective property of the system...The \"reduction of the wavepacket\" does take place in the consciousness of the observer, not because of any unique physical process which takes place there, but only because the state is a construct of the observer and not an objective property of the physical system.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hartle | first1 = J.

Consequently, if quantum mechanics is to be a complete theory, relational quantum mechanics argues that the notion of \"state\" describes not the observed system itself, but the relationship, or correlation, between the system and its observer(s).  The [[Quantum state vector|state vector]] of conventional quantum mechanics becomes a description of the correlation of some ''degrees of freedom'' in the observer, with respect to the observed system.  However, it is held by relational quantum mechanics that this applies to all physical objects, whether or not they are conscious or macroscopic. Any \"measurement event\" is seen simply as an ordinary physical interaction, an establishment of the sort of correlation discussed above.  Thus the physical content of the theory has to do not with objects themselves, but the relations between them.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-relational/\n |title=Relational Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\n |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu\n |date=\n |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref><ref>For more information, see {{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02302261 |author=Carlo Rovelli |year=1996 |title=Relational Quantum Mechanics |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1637\u20131678 |arxiv=quant-ph/9609002|bibcode = 1996IJTP...35.1637R |authorlink= Carlo Rovelli }}</ref>\n\nAn independent [[Relational approach to quantum physics|relational approach to quantum mechanics]] was developed in analogy with David Bohm's elucidation of special relativity,<ref>David Bohm, ''The Special Theory of Relativity'', Benjamin, New York, 1965</ref> in which a detection event is regarded as establishing a relationship between the quantized field and the detector.

QBism draws from the fields of [[quantum information]] and [[Bayesian probability]] and aims to eliminate the interpretational conundrums that have beset quantum theory.\n\nQBism deals with common questions in the interpretation of quantum theory about the nature of [[wavefunction]] [[Quantum superposition|superposition]], [[Measurement problem|quantum measurement]], and [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]].<ref name=\":21\">{{cite journal|last=Timpson|first=Christopher Gordon|year=2008|title=Quantum Bayesianism: A study|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~bras2317/qb_s.ps|format=postscript|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|volume=39|issue=3|pages=579\u2013609|arxiv=0804.2047|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2008.03.006|via=|accessdate=|bibcode=2008SHPMP..39..579T}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mermin|first=N.

The phenomena associated with measurement are claimed to be explained by [[Quantum decoherence|decoherence]], which occurs when states interact with the environment producing [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]], repeatedly \"splitting\" the universe into mutually unobservable alternate histories\u2014effectively distinct universes within a greater [[multiverse]].\n\n=== Consistent histories ===\n{{Main|Consistent histories}}\n\nThe [[consistent histories]] interpretation generalizes the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and attempts to provide a natural interpretation of [[quantum cosmology]]. The theory is based on a consistency criterion that allows the history of a system to be described so that the probabilities for each history obey the additive rules of classical probability. It is claimed to be [[consistent]] with the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]].\n\nAccording to this interpretation, the purpose of a quantum-mechanical theory is to predict the relative probabilities of various alternative histories (for example, of a particle).\n\n=== Ensemble interpretation ===\n{{Main|Ensemble interpretation}}\n\nThe [[ensemble interpretation]], also called the statistical interpretation, can be viewed as a minimalist interpretation. That is, it claims to make the fewest assumptions associated with the standard mathematics. It takes the statistical interpretation of Born to the fullest extent. The interpretation states that the wave function does not apply to an individual system{{spaced ndash}}for example, a single particle{{spaced ndash}}but is an abstract statistical quantity that only applies to an ensemble (a vast multitude) of similarly prepared systems or particles. In the words of Einstein:\n\n{{Quote|The attempt to conceive the quantum-theoretical description as the complete description of the individual systems leads to unnatural theoretical interpretations, which become immediately unnecessary if one accepts the interpretation that the description refers to ensembles of systems and not to individual systems.|Einstein in ''Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist'', ed.

Particles, which always have positions, are guided by the wavefunction.  The wavefunction evolves according to the [[Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation]], and the wavefunction never collapses. The theory takes place in a single space-time, is [[Principle of locality|non-local]], and is deterministic. The simultaneous determination of a particle's position and velocity is subject to the usual [[uncertainty principle]] constraint. The theory is considered to be a [[hidden-variable theory]], and by embracing non-locality it satisfies Bell's inequality.

It was proposed in 2003 by [[Wojciech Zurek]] and a group of collaborators including Ollivier, Poulin, Paz and Blume-Kohout.

Thus, objective-collapse theories are realistic, indeterministic, no-hidden-variables theories.  Standard quantum mechanics does not specify any mechanism of collapse; QM would need to be extended if objective collapse is correct.

This creates [[retrocausality]]: events in the future can affect ones in the past, exactly as events in the past can affect ones in the future.  In these theories, a single measurement cannot fully determine the state of a system (making them a type of [[hidden-variables theory]]), but given two measurements performed at different times, it is possible to calculate the exact state of the system at all intermediate times.  The collapse of the wavefunction is therefore not a physical change to the system, just a change in our knowledge of it due to the second measurement.  Similarly, they explain entanglement as not being a true physical state but just an illusion created by ignoring retrocausality.  The point where two particles appear to \"become entangled\" is simply a point where each particle is being influenced by events that occur to the other particle in the future.\n\nNot all advocates of time-symmetric causality favour modifying the unitary dynamics of standard quantum mechanics. Thus a leading exponent of the two-state vector formalism, Lev Vaidman, states that the two-state vector formalism dovetails well with [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]].<ref>Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: ''The Two-State Vector Formalism of Quantum Mechanics: an Updated Review''.

It also has some resemblance to hidden-variable theories and the ensemble interpretation: particles in BST have multiple well defined trajectories at the microscopic level. These can only be treated stochastically at a coarse grained level, in line with the ensemble interpretation.<ref name=\"Sharlow\">[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3781/1/what_branching_spacetime_might_do.pdf Sharlow, Mark; \"What Branching Spacetime might do for Physics\"] p.2</ref>\n\n== Comparisons ==\nThe most common interpretations are summarized in the table below. The values shown in the cells of the table are not without controversy, for the precise meanings of some of the concepts involved are unclear and, in fact, are themselves at the center of the controversy surrounding the given interpretation. For another table comparing interpretations of quantum theory, see reference.<ref>{{Cite book|title=What is quantum information?|last=Olimpia|first=Lombardi|last2=1979-|first2=Fortin, Sebastian|last3=Federico|first3=Holik|last4=Cristian|first4=L\u00f3pez|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9781107142114|location=|pages=138\u2013144|oclc=965759965|arxiv = 1509.04711|doi = 10.1017/9781316494233.009|chapter = Interpretations of Quantum Theory: A Map of Madness}}</ref>\n\nNo experimental evidence exists that distinguishes among these interpretations. To that extent, the physical theory stands, and is consistent with itself and with reality; difficulties arise only when one attempts to \"interpret\" the theory.  Nevertheless, designing experiments which would test the various interpretations is the subject of active research.\n\nMost of these interpretations have variants. For example, it is difficult to get a precise definition of the Copenhagen interpretation as it was developed and argued about by many people.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
