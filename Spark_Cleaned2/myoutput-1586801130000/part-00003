The term started being used in the 1970s as a way of linking experiences, issues and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time 'Indigenous people(s)' also began to be used to describe a legal category in indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the 's' in 'peoples' recognizes that there are real differences between different indigenous peoples.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Linda Tuhiwai|url=|title=Decolonizing methodologies : research and indigenous peoples|publisher=Otago University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-877578-28-1|edition=Second|location=Dunedin, New Zealand|pages=|oclc=805707083}}</ref><ref>Robert K.

Their ability to influence and participate in the external policies that may exercise [[jurisdiction]] over their traditional lands and practices is very frequently limited. This situation can persist even in the case where the indigenous population outnumbers that of the other inhabitants of the region or state; the defining notion here is one of separation from decision and regulatory processes that have some, at least titular, influence over aspects of their community and [[land rights]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/indigenouspeoples|title=Indigenous Peoples|website=World Bank|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nIn a ground-breaking 1997 decision involving the [[Ainu people#Litigation|Ainu people]] of Japan, the Japanese courts recognized their claim in law, stating that \"If one minority group lived in an area prior to being ruled over by a majority group and preserved its distinct ethnic culture even after being ruled over by the majority group, while another came to live in an area ruled over by a majority after consenting to the majority rule, it must be recognized that it is only natural that the distinct ethnic culture of the former group requires greater consideration.\"<ref>Judgment of the Sapporo District Court, Civil Division No. 3, 27 March 1997, in (1999) 38 ILM, p. 419</ref>\n\nIn Russia, definition of \"indigenous peoples\" is contested largely referring to a number of population (less than 50 000 people), and neglecting self-identification, origin from indigenous populations who inhabited the country or region upon invasion, colonization or establishment of state frontiers, distinctive social, economic and cultural institutions.<ref>IWGIA (2012).

These peoples inhabited lands surrounding the [[Aegean Sea]] before the subsequent migrations of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] ancestors claimed by these authors. The disposition and precise identity of this former group is elusive, and sources such as [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]] and [[Herodotus]] give varying, partially mythological accounts. However, it is clear that cultures existed whose indigenous characteristics were distinguished by the subsequent Hellenic cultures (and distinct from non-Greek speaking \"foreigners\", termed \"[[barbarian]]s\" by the historical Greeks).\n\n[[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] society flourished between 250&nbsp;BCE and 480&nbsp;CE and commanded successive waves of conquests that gripped more than half of the globe. But because already existent populations within other parts of Europe at the time of [[classical antiquity]] had more in common culturally speaking with the Greco-Roman world, the intricacies involved in expansion across the European frontier were not so contentious relative to indigenous issues.<ref>Hall, Gillette, and Harry Anthony Patrinos. Indigenous Peoples, Poverty and Human Development in Latin America. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, n.d. Google Scholar. Web. 11 Mar. 2013</ref>\n\nHowever, when it came to expansion in other parts of the world, namely Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, then totally new cultural dynamics had entered into the equation, and this expansion became a forerunner of what was to take the Americas, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific by storm in more recent times. Thus, the idea that expansionist societies may encounter peoples who possess cultural customs and racial appearances strikingly different from those of the colonizing power was not new to the [[Renaissance]] or the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\n[[File:AlonsoFernandezdeLugo2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]] presenting the captured [[Guanches|Guanche]] kings of [[Tenerife]] to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]].]]\n\n===European expansion and colonialism===\n{{See also|Columbian exchange}}\nThe rapid and extensive spread of the various European powers from the early 15th century onward had a profound impact upon many of the indigenous cultures with whom they came into contact. The [[Age of Discovery|exploratory]] and colonial ventures in the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Pacific often resulted in territorial and cultural conflict, and the intentional or unintentional displacement and devastation of the indigenous populations.\n\nEncounters between explorers and indigenous populations in the rest of the world often introduced new [[Infection|infectious diseases]], which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. For example, [[smallpox]], [[measles]], malaria, yellow fever, and others were unknown in pre-Columbian America and Australia.\n\nThe [[Canary Islands]] had an indigenous population called the [[Guanches]] whose origin is still the subject of discussion among historians and linguists.<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html Old World Contacts/Colonists/Canary Islands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013124301/http://ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html |date=13 October 2007 }}.

The United Nations estimates that there are over 370 million indigenous people living in over 70 countries worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf|title=Who are indigenous peoples?|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> This would equate to just fewer than 6% of the total [[world population]].

Many indigenous populations have undergone a dramatic decline and even extinction, and remain threatened in many parts of the world. Some have also been assimilated by other populations or have undergone many other changes. In other cases, indigenous populations are undergoing a recovery or expansion in numbers.\n\nCertain indigenous societies survive even though they may no longer inhabit their \"traditional\" lands, owing to migration, relocation, forced resettlement or having been supplanted by other cultural groups.  In many other respects, the [[transformation of culture]] of indigenous groups is ongoing, and includes permanent loss of language, loss of lands, encroachment on traditional territories, and disruption in traditional ways of life due to contamination and pollution of waters and lands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Environmental and economic benefits of having indigenous peoples tend land===\n{{See also|Climate change and indigenous peoples}}\nA WRI report mentions that \u201ctenure-secure\u201d indigenous lands generates billions and sometimes trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of benefits in the form of carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and more.

The numbers, condition and experience of indigenous groups may vary widely within a given region. A comprehensive survey is further complicated by sometimes contentious membership and identification.\n\n===Africa===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of Africa}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of Africa}}[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumb|Starting fire by hand, [[San people]] in Botswana.]]\nIn the post-colonial period, the concept of specific indigenous peoples within the African continent has gained wider acceptance, although not without controversy. The highly diverse and numerous ethnic groups that comprise most modern, independent African states contain within them various peoples whose situation, cultures and [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] or [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyles are generally marginalized and set apart from the dominant political and economic structures of the nation. Since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought recognition of their rights as distinct indigenous peoples, in both national and international contexts.\n\nThough the vast majority of African peoples are indigenous in the sense that they originate from that continent, in practice, identity as an ''indigenous people'' per the modern definition is more restrictive, and certainly not every African ethnic group claims identification under these terms. Groups and communities who do claim this recognition are those who, by a variety of historical and environmental circumstances, have been placed outside of the dominant state systems, and whose traditional practices and land claims often come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by governments, companies and surrounding dominant societies.\n\n===Americas===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n[[File:Quechuawomanandchild.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quechuas|Quechua]] woman and child in the [[Sacred Valley]], Andes, Peru.]]\nIndigenous peoples of the American continent are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the arrival of European colonizers and settlers (i.e., [[Pre-Columbian]]). Indigenous peoples who maintain, or seek to maintain, traditional ways of life are found from the high Arctic north to the southern extremities of [[Tierra del Fuego]].\n\nThe impact of [[European colonization of the Americas]] on the indigenous communities has been in general quite severe, with many authorities estimating ranges of significant [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|population decline]] primarily due to disease but also violence. The extent of this impact is the subject of much continuing debate. Several peoples shortly thereafter became extinct, or very nearly so.\n\nAll nations in North and South America have populations of indigenous peoples within their borders. In some countries (particularly in Latin American), indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national population \u2014 in Bolivia they account for an estimated 56\u201370% of the total nation, and at least half of the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region and include such ethnonyms as [[Native Americans (Americas)|Native Americans]], [[Amerindians]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]].

These groups are often together spoken of as [[Indigenous Australians]].\n\nMany of the present-day Pacific Island nations in the Oceania region were originally populated by [[Polynesia]]n, [[Melanesia]]n and [[Micronesia]]n peoples over the course of thousands of years. European colonial expansion in the Pacific brought many of these under non-indigenous administration. During the 20th century several of these former colonies gained independence and nation-states were formed under local control. However, various peoples have put forward claims for indigenous recognition where their islands are still under external administration; examples include the [[Chamorros]] of [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Marianas]], and the [[Marshallese people|Marshallese]] of the [[Marshall Islands]].\n\nThe remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were recently found on the islands of [[Palau]] in Micronesia.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/mar/12/fossils Pygmy human remains found on rock islands], Science | The Guardian</ref>\n\nIn most parts of Oceania, indigenous peoples outnumber the descendants of colonists. Exceptions include Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. According to the 2013 census, New Zealand [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] make up 14.9% of the population of New Zealand, with less than half (46.5%) of all Maori residents identifying solely as Maori. The Maori are indigenous to Polynesia and settled New Zealand relatively recently, the migrations were thought to have occurred in the 13th century CE. In New Zealand pre-contact Maori peoples were not a single people, thus the more recent grouping into tribal (iwi) arrangements has become a more formal arrangement in more recent times. Many Maori national leaders signed a treaty with the British, the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], which formed the modern geo-political entity that is New Zealand.\n\nA majority of the [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG) population is indigenous, with more than 700 different nationalities recognized out of a total population of 8 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15436981|title=Papua New Guinea country profile|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> The country's Constitution and key statutes identify traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure, and explicitly set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within the modern state.

Some challenges are specific to particular groups; however, other challenges are commonly experienced.<ref>Bartholomew Dean and Jerome Levi (eds.) ''At the Risk of Being Heard: Indigenous Rights, Identity and Postcolonial States'' University of Michigan Press (2003)[https://web.archive.org/web/20060821225323/http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do;jsessionid=1ADB525E82D520F3CE8B1393F0EAA914?id=11605]</ref>  These issues include cultural and linguistic preservation, [[land rights]], ownership and exploitation of natural resources, political determination and autonomy, environmental degradation and incursion, poverty, health, and discrimination.\n\nThe interaction between indigenous and non-indigenous societies throughout history has been complex, ranging from outright conflict and subjugation to some degree of mutual benefit and cultural transfer. A particular aspect of [[Anthropology|anthropological study]] involves investigation into the ramifications of what is termed [[First contact (anthropology)|''first contact'']], the study of what occurs when two cultures first encounter one another. The situation can be further confused when there is a complicated or contested history of migration and population of a given region, which can give rise to disputes about primacy and ownership of the land and resources.\n\nWherever indigenous cultural identity is asserted, common societal issues and concerns arise from the indigenous status. These concerns are often not unique to indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of indigenous peoples, it may be noted that they share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures of indigenous peoples are being lost and that indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into their surrounding societies. This is borne out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the [[Yakuts|Sakha]] and [[Komi peoples]] (two northern [[indigenous peoples of Russia]]), who now control their own autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian [[Inuit]], who form a majority of the territory of [[Nunavut]] (created in 1999). Despite the control of their territories, many Sakha people have lost their lands as a result of the [[Russian Homestead Act]], which allows any Russian citizen to own any land in the Far Eastern region of Russia.

Their ability to influence and participate in the external policies that may exercise [[jurisdiction]] over their traditional lands and practices is very frequently limited. This situation can persist even in the case where the indigenous population outnumbers that of the other inhabitants of the region or state; the defining notion here is one of separation from decision and regulatory processes that have some, at least titular, influence over aspects of their community and [[land rights]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/indigenouspeoples|title=Indigenous Peoples|website=World Bank|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nIn a ground-breaking 1997 decision involving the [[Ainu people#Litigation|Ainu people]] of Japan, the Japanese courts recognized their claim in law, stating that \"If one minority group lived in an area prior to being ruled over by a majority group and preserved its distinct ethnic culture even after being ruled over by the majority group, while another came to live in an area ruled over by a majority after consenting to the majority rule, it must be recognized that it is only natural that the distinct ethnic culture of the former group requires greater consideration.\"<ref>Judgment of the Sapporo District Court, Civil Division No. 3, 27 March 1997, in (1999) 38 ILM, p. 419</ref>\n\nIn Russia, definition of \"indigenous peoples\" is contested largely referring to a number of population (less than 50 000 people), and neglecting self-identification, origin from indigenous populations who inhabited the country or region upon invasion, colonization or establishment of state frontiers, distinctive social, economic and cultural institutions.<ref>IWGIA (2012).

These peoples inhabited lands surrounding the [[Aegean Sea]] before the subsequent migrations of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] ancestors claimed by these authors. The disposition and precise identity of this former group is elusive, and sources such as [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]] and [[Herodotus]] give varying, partially mythological accounts. However, it is clear that cultures existed whose indigenous characteristics were distinguished by the subsequent Hellenic cultures (and distinct from non-Greek speaking \"foreigners\", termed \"[[barbarian]]s\" by the historical Greeks).\n\n[[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] society flourished between 250&nbsp;BCE and 480&nbsp;CE and commanded successive waves of conquests that gripped more than half of the globe. But because already existent populations within other parts of Europe at the time of [[classical antiquity]] had more in common culturally speaking with the Greco-Roman world, the intricacies involved in expansion across the European frontier were not so contentious relative to indigenous issues.<ref>Hall, Gillette, and Harry Anthony Patrinos. Indigenous Peoples, Poverty and Human Development in Latin America. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, n.d. Google Scholar. Web. 11 Mar. 2013</ref>\n\nHowever, when it came to expansion in other parts of the world, namely Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, then totally new cultural dynamics had entered into the equation, and this expansion became a forerunner of what was to take the Americas, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific by storm in more recent times. Thus, the idea that expansionist societies may encounter peoples who possess cultural customs and racial appearances strikingly different from those of the colonizing power was not new to the [[Renaissance]] or the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\n[[File:AlonsoFernandezdeLugo2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]] presenting the captured [[Guanches|Guanche]] kings of [[Tenerife]] to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]].]]\n\n===European expansion and colonialism===\n{{See also|Columbian exchange}}\nThe rapid and extensive spread of the various European powers from the early 15th century onward had a profound impact upon many of the indigenous cultures with whom they came into contact. The [[Age of Discovery|exploratory]] and colonial ventures in the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Pacific often resulted in territorial and cultural conflict, and the intentional or unintentional displacement and devastation of the indigenous populations.\n\nEncounters between explorers and indigenous populations in the rest of the world often introduced new [[Infection|infectious diseases]], which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. For example, [[smallpox]], [[measles]], malaria, yellow fever, and others were unknown in pre-Columbian America and Australia.\n\nThe [[Canary Islands]] had an indigenous population called the [[Guanches]] whose origin is still the subject of discussion among historians and linguists.<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html Old World Contacts/Colonists/Canary Islands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013124301/http://ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html |date=13 October 2007 }}.

The United Nations estimates that there are over 370 million indigenous people living in over 70 countries worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf|title=Who are indigenous peoples?|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> This would equate to just fewer than 6% of the total [[world population]].

Many indigenous populations have undergone a dramatic decline and even extinction, and remain threatened in many parts of the world. Some have also been assimilated by other populations or have undergone many other changes. In other cases, indigenous populations are undergoing a recovery or expansion in numbers.\n\nCertain indigenous societies survive even though they may no longer inhabit their \"traditional\" lands, owing to migration, relocation, forced resettlement or having been supplanted by other cultural groups.  In many other respects, the [[transformation of culture]] of indigenous groups is ongoing, and includes permanent loss of language, loss of lands, encroachment on traditional territories, and disruption in traditional ways of life due to contamination and pollution of waters and lands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Environmental and economic benefits of having indigenous peoples tend land===\n{{See also|Climate change and indigenous peoples}}\nA WRI report mentions that \u201ctenure-secure\u201d indigenous lands generates billions and sometimes trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of benefits in the form of carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and more.

The numbers, condition and experience of indigenous groups may vary widely within a given region. A comprehensive survey is further complicated by sometimes contentious membership and identification.\n\n===Africa===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of Africa}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of Africa}}[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumb|Starting fire by hand, [[San people]] in Botswana.]]\nIn the post-colonial period, the concept of specific indigenous peoples within the African continent has gained wider acceptance, although not without controversy. The highly diverse and numerous ethnic groups that comprise most modern, independent African states contain within them various peoples whose situation, cultures and [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] or [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyles are generally marginalized and set apart from the dominant political and economic structures of the nation. Since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought recognition of their rights as distinct indigenous peoples, in both national and international contexts.\n\nThough the vast majority of African peoples are indigenous in the sense that they originate from that continent, in practice, identity as an ''indigenous people'' per the modern definition is more restrictive, and certainly not every African ethnic group claims identification under these terms. Groups and communities who do claim this recognition are those who, by a variety of historical and environmental circumstances, have been placed outside of the dominant state systems, and whose traditional practices and land claims often come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by governments, companies and surrounding dominant societies.\n\n===Americas===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n[[File:Quechuawomanandchild.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quechuas|Quechua]] woman and child in the [[Sacred Valley]], Andes, Peru.]]\nIndigenous peoples of the American continent are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the arrival of European colonizers and settlers (i.e., [[Pre-Columbian]]). Indigenous peoples who maintain, or seek to maintain, traditional ways of life are found from the high Arctic north to the southern extremities of [[Tierra del Fuego]].\n\nThe impact of [[European colonization of the Americas]] on the indigenous communities has been in general quite severe, with many authorities estimating ranges of significant [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|population decline]] primarily due to disease but also violence. The extent of this impact is the subject of much continuing debate. Several peoples shortly thereafter became extinct, or very nearly so.\n\nAll nations in North and South America have populations of indigenous peoples within their borders. In some countries (particularly in Latin American), indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national population \u2014 in Bolivia they account for an estimated 56\u201370% of the total nation, and at least half of the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region and include such ethnonyms as [[Native Americans (Americas)|Native Americans]], [[Amerindians]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]. In Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries one finds the use of terms such as ''pueblos [[wikt:ind\u00edgena|ind\u00edgenas]]'', ''amerindios'', ''povos nativos'', ''povos ind\u00edgenas'', and, in Peru, ''Comunidades Nativas'' (Native Communities), particularly among Amazonian societies like the [[Urarina]]<ref>Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}} [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]</ref> and [[Mats\u00e9s]].

These groups are often together spoken of as [[Indigenous Australians]].\n\nMany of the present-day Pacific Island nations in the Oceania region were originally populated by [[Polynesia]]n, [[Melanesia]]n and [[Micronesia]]n peoples over the course of thousands of years. European colonial expansion in the Pacific brought many of these under non-indigenous administration. During the 20th century several of these former colonies gained independence and nation-states were formed under local control. However, various peoples have put forward claims for indigenous recognition where their islands are still under external administration; examples include the [[Chamorros]] of [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Marianas]], and the [[Marshallese people|Marshallese]] of the [[Marshall Islands]].\n\nThe remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were recently found on the islands of [[Palau]] in Micronesia.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/mar/12/fossils Pygmy human remains found on rock islands], Science | The Guardian</ref>\n\nIn most parts of Oceania, indigenous peoples outnumber the descendants of colonists. Exceptions include Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. According to the 2013 census, New Zealand [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] make up 14.9% of the population of New Zealand, with less than half (46.5%) of all Maori residents identifying solely as Maori. The Maori are indigenous to Polynesia and settled New Zealand relatively recently, the migrations were thought to have occurred in the 13th century CE. In New Zealand pre-contact Maori peoples were not a single people, thus the more recent grouping into tribal (iwi) arrangements has become a more formal arrangement in more recent times. Many Maori national leaders signed a treaty with the British, the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], which formed the modern geo-political entity that is New Zealand.\n\nA majority of the [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG) population is indigenous, with more than 700 different nationalities recognized out of a total population of 8 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15436981|title=Papua New Guinea country profile|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> The country's Constitution and key statutes identify traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure, and explicitly set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within the modern state.

Some challenges are specific to particular groups; however, other challenges are commonly experienced.<ref>Bartholomew Dean and Jerome Levi (eds.) ''At the Risk of Being Heard: Indigenous Rights, Identity and Postcolonial States'' University of Michigan Press (2003)[https://web.archive.org/web/20060821225323/http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do;jsessionid=1ADB525E82D520F3CE8B1393F0EAA914?id=11605]</ref>  These issues include cultural and linguistic preservation, [[land rights]], ownership and exploitation of natural resources, political determination and autonomy, environmental degradation and incursion, poverty, health, and discrimination.\n\nThe interaction between indigenous and non-indigenous societies throughout history has been complex, ranging from outright conflict and subjugation to some degree of mutual benefit and cultural transfer. A particular aspect of [[Anthropology|anthropological study]] involves investigation into the ramifications of what is termed [[First contact (anthropology)|''first contact'']], the study of what occurs when two cultures first encounter one another. The situation can be further confused when there is a complicated or contested history of migration and population of a given region, which can give rise to disputes about primacy and ownership of the land and resources.\n\nWherever indigenous cultural identity is asserted, common societal issues and concerns arise from the indigenous status. These concerns are often not unique to indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of indigenous peoples, it may be noted that they share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures of indigenous peoples are being lost and that indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into their surrounding societies. This is borne out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the [[Yakuts|Sakha]] and [[Komi peoples]] (two northern [[indigenous peoples of Russia]]), who now control their own autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian [[Inuit]], who form a majority of the territory of [[Nunavut]] (created in 1999). Despite the control of their territories, many Sakha people have lost their lands as a result of the [[Russian Homestead Act]], which allows any Russian citizen to own any land in the Far Eastern region of Russia. In Australia, a landmark case, ''Mabo'' v ''Queensland'' (No 2),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCATrans/1991/23.pdf|title=Mabo v Queensland|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> saw the High Court of Australia reject the idea of {{Lang|la|terra nullius}}.

As a consequence, the [[World Health Organization]], at its Forty-seventh World Health Assembly, established a core advisory group of indigenous representatives with special knowledge of the health needs and resources of their communities, thus beginning a long-term commitment to the issue of the health of indigenous peoples.<ref name=\"WHO\">{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/ethics/activities/WHA47.27.pdf |title=Resolutions and Decisions.

These terms occurred commonly during the heyday of European colonial expansion, but still continue in use in certain societies in modern times.<ref>''See'' ''Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe'', 435 U.S. 191 (1978); also see Robert Williams, ''Like a Loaded Weapon''</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th century, Europeans commonly labeled indigenous peoples as \"uncivilized\". Some philosophers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588-1679), considered indigenous people to be merely \"savages\". Others (especially literary figures in the 18th century) popularised the concept of \"[[noble savage]]s\". Those who were close to the Hobbesian view tended to believe themselves to have a duty to \"civilize\" and \"modernize\" the indigenous. Although anthropologists, especially from Europe, used{{when?|date=February 2020}} to apply these terms to all tribal cultures, the practice has fallen into disfavor as demeaning and is, according to many anthropologists, not only inaccurate, but dangerous.\n\n[[Survival International]] runs a campaign to stamp out media portrayal of indigenous peoples as \"primitive\" or \"savages\".<ref name=survivalinternationalfaq>[http://www.survivalinternational.org/info Survival International website \u2013 About Us/FAQ].

At the same time, the anti-colonial movement, and advocates of indigenous peoples, argued that words such as \"civilized\" and \"savage\" were products and tools of [[colonialism]], and argued that colonialism itself was savagely destructive. In the mid-20th century European attitudes began to shift to the view that indigenous and tribal peoples should have the right to decide for themselves what should happen to their ancient cultures and ancestral lands.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n|url= https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples.html\n|title= United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples {{!}} United Nations For Indigenous Peoples\n|website= www.un.org|access-date=2020-01-22\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Cultural appropriation ===\nThe cultures of indigenous peoples can become a happy hunting ground for [[New Age]] advocates seeking to find ancient traditional truths, [[spirituality | spiritualities]] and practices to [[cultural appropriation | appropriate]] into their worldviews.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Pike\n | first1 = Sarah M.\n | author-link1 = Sarah M.
