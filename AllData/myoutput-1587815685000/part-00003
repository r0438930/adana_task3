When they emerged from Leonard's bedroom, the others saw them and Penny said \"It's not what it looks like\".\n\nThe first scene takes place at lunch, with Sheldon wondering what Penny meant by her \"[[brain teaser]]\". After he comes up with the idea that Penny was checking Raj's anal region for [[pinworms]], Leonard tells him that Penny and Raj did have sex, and that Penny was lying when she said it wasn't what it looked like. Raj and Howard then arrive. Howard and Leonard are both annoyed that Raj had sex with Penny, and Raj tries to defend himself by saying that they are in love. Leonard reveals to Howard that Raj used to like Bernadette, infuriating Howard further.\n\nSheldon, sensing that Leonard is upset, calls Leonard's mother and the two converse through video chat. Leonard explains that while he doesn't want to get back with Penny, he cannot deal that she slept with one of his friends. He is also confused because his current girlfriend, Priya, is going to move back to [[India]]. His mother, despite her being an expert in psychology, parenting and child development, has no advice other than \"Buck up, sissy pants\".\n\nAmy arrives at Penny's apartment, and Amy tries to console her. She tells an [[apocryphal]] [[Legends of Catherine the Great|legend about Catherine the Great]], a Russian leader in the 18th century who, according to the story, used a system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse. When Penny asks her how this is relevant to her, Amy says that she took part in \"interspecies hanky-panky\" yet people still refer to her as \"the Great\". Then Penny, wanting to avoid contact with Leonard and the others, asks to stay at Amy's house for a while. Raj finds out that Penny is staying there through Amy's [[Facebook]] page and shows up. Raj asks Penny out on a date, but Penny tells him that having sex with him was a mistake and that she wishes to just remain friends. Raj reveals that the previous night, he had trouble putting the condom on and ejaculated prematurely; the two did not actually have sex. She agrees not to tell anyone about this.\n\nDuring a [[paintball]] match against members of other [[Caltech]] departments, Sheldon appoints himself as captain of the guys' team. There is the lack of enthusiasm among the team due to the recent events. Sheldon, blaming himself, sacrifices himself to the geology department and the gang rush out to avenge him, and manage to claim a victory.\n\nAs the guys celebrate their victory, they are interrupted by Penny, who announces her plans to move back to [[Nebraska]], because of her failing acting career and her fractured relationship with the guys. As Leonard tries to comfort her, she is interrupted by a phone call from an agent who tells her she got a part in a [[hemorrhoid]] cream commercial. She changes her mind and stays in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] because she is going to \"be a star\".\n\nThe episode is concluded with everybody watching Penny's hemorrhoid commercial.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Ratings===\nOn the night of its first broadcast on September 22, 2011, the episode was watched by 14.30 million U.S. households and a [[Nielsen rating]] of 4.9/15.<ref name=\"s05e01/02\">{{cite news|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/09/23/thursday-finals-big-bang-theory-the-x-factor-parks-recreation-and-whitney-adjusted-up/104707/|title=Thursday Finals: 'Big Bang Theory,' 'The X Factor,' 'Parks & Recreation' and 'Whitney' Adjusted Up|work=TVbytheNumbers.com|first=Robert|last=Seidman|date=September 23, 2011|accessdate=September 29, 2011}}</ref> The episode was watched by 3.72 million Canadian viewers and had a weekly ranking of 3.<ref name=\"bbmsept19\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbm.ca/_documents/top_30_tv_programs_english/2011/nat09192011.pdf |title=Top Programs \u2013 Total Canada (English) September 19 \u2013 September 25, 2011 |work=bbm.ca |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609223548/http://www.bbm.ca/_documents/top_30_tv_programs_english/2011/nat09192011.pdf |archivedate=June 9, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn Australia, the episode first aired on October 10, 2011.
