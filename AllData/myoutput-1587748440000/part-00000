It was a major advance in the [[history of anatomy]] over the long-dominant work of [[Galen]], and presented itself as such.\n\nThe collection of books is based on his [[University of Padua|Paduan]] lectures, during which he deviated from common practice by dissecting a corpse to illustrate what he was discussing. [[Dissection]]s had previously been performed by a [[barber surgeon]] under the direction of a doctor of medicine, who was not expected to perform manual labour. Vesalius's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' presents a careful examination of the organs and the complete structure of the human body. This would not have been possible without the many advances that had been made during the [[Renaissance]], including artistic developments in literal visual representation and the technical development of printing with refined [[woodcut]] engravings. Because of these developments and his careful, immediate involvement, Vesalius was able to produce illustrations superior to any produced previously.\n\n==Books of the collection==\nVesalius arranged his work into seven books.\n\n===Book 1: The Bones and Cartilages===\nThe first book constitutes about a quarter of the entire collection. It presents Vesalius' observations on human bones and cartilage, which he [[body snatching|collected from cemeteries]]. It covers the physical appearance of human bones and the differentiation of human bones and cartilage by function. In each chapter Vesalius describes the bones in great detail, explaining their physical qualities in different ways. In the opening chapters,  Vesalius \"gives general aspects of bones and skeletal organisation, dealing with the differences in texture, strength,  and resilience between bone and cartilage; explaining the complex differences  between types of joints and reviewing some basic elements of descriptive techniques and terminology.\" A major theme of this book is whether [[Galen]] described the bones of the human skeleton accurately. When Vesalius lectured on the human skeleton, he also had to present the bones of animals to give credibility to Galen's observations.\n[[File:Vesalius Fabrica p163.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Image from [[Andreas Vesalius]]' ''De humani corporis fabrica'' (1543), page 163.]]\n\n===Book 2: The Ligaments and Muscles===\nHere Vesalius describes the structure of the muscles, the agents used in creating movement by the body, and the material used to hold the joints together. Through his observations of  butchers cutting meat, he was able to incorporate the skills they used in the dissection of the human body. The order in which to dissect a human body to effectively observe each muscle in the body is laid out. Each illustration displays a deepening view of the human body which can be followed while dissecting a human body.  Vesalius also mentions the instruments needed to perform a dissection. Here Vesalius begins to describe how Galen's anatomical descriptions do not match his own observations. In order to show respect to Galen, he suggests Galen's use of anatomical structure is in fact correct, but not for humans. He even continues to describe some of the structures in the way Galen would.\n\n===Book 3: The Veins and Arteries, Book 4: The Nerves===\nIn Books 3 and 4, Vesalius describes the veins, arteries, and nerves as vessels, but notes their differing physical structure: veins and  arteries contains a hollow channel, but nerves do not. Vesalius describes the route by which air travels through the lungs and the heart. He describes this process as \"a tree whose trunks divide into branches and twigs\". He also describes how the body contains four veins (the portal vein, the venae cavae, the artery-like vein [now understood as the [[Pulmonary Vein]]], and the umbilical vein) and two arteries (the aorta, and the vein-like artery [now understood as the [[Pulmonary Artery]]]) as being the main vessels which branch out into smaller veins and arteries. Vesalius lists some six hundred vessels in his tabulation of arteries, veins and nerves, but fails to mention the smaller vessels located in the hands and feet, the terminal vessels of the cutaneous nerves, or the vessels in the lungs and liver.\n\n===Book 5: The Organs of Nutrition and Generation===\nVesalius gives detailed descriptions of the organs of nutrition, the urinary system, and the male and female reproductive systems. The alimentary and reproductive systems each make up about forty percent of this book, and the description of the renal system and the correct technique for dissecting it makes up the remainder. In the final chapter, the longest chapter of the entire collection, Vesalius gives detailed step-by-step instructions on how to dissect the abdominopelvic organs. In the first half of the book, Vesalius describes the peritoneum, the esophagus, the stomach, the omentum, the intestines and the mesentery. He then goes on to describe the liver, gall bladder, and the spleen. Finally, he describes the kidneys, the bladder, and the ureters. Although Vesalius was unfamiliar with the anatomy of pregnancy, he provides illustrations of the placenta and the fetal membrane, making anatomical reference to Galen by comparing a dog's reproductive organs to those of a human.\n\n===Book 6: The Heart and Associated Organs, Book 7: The Brain===\n[[File:Vesalius 609c.png|thumb|upright|Vesalius' ''De humani corporis fabrica'', figure on plate 609, contrasted.]]\n\nThese books describe the structure and functions of the heart and the organs of respiration, the brain and its coverings, the eye, the organs of sensation, and the nerves of the limbs. A chapter is also devoted to the dissection of the eye. Vesalius describes the organs of the body in great detail by commenting \"on the variable strength of the attachment of the pleura to the thoracic walls, the strong attachment of the pericardium to the diaphragm, the shape and orientation of the ventricles of the heart,  and the description of the semilunar valves.\" He closes each book with a chapter on the correct way to dissect the heart and the brain respectively.\n\n==Galen's errors==\nGalen, the prominent [[Greeks|Greek]] [[physician]], [[surgeon]] and [[Philosophy|philosopher]] in the [[Roman empire]] had written on anatomy among other topics, but his work remained largely unchecked until the time of Vesalius. The ''Fabrica'' rectified some of Galen's worst errors, including the notion that the great blood vessels originated from the liver. While examining a human corpse, Vesalius discovered that Galen's observations were inconsistent with those of his, due to  Galen's use of animal (dog and monkey) cadavers. Even with his improvements, however, Vesalius clung to some of Galen's errors, such as the idea that a different type of blood flowed through veins than through arteries. It was not until [[William Harvey]]'s work on the [[circulation of the blood]] (''[[De Motu Cordis]]'', 1628) that this misconception of Galen's would be rectified in Europe.\n[[File:Vesalius Fabrica p372.jpg|thumb|upright|Image from ''De humani corporis fabrica'' (1543), page 372.]]\n\n==Publication==\n\n===1543 edition===\nVesalius had the work published at the age of 28, taking great pains to ensure its quality, and dedicated it to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]. The more than 250 illustrations are of great artistic merit and are generally attributed by modern scholars to the \"studio of [[Titian]]\" rather than [[Jan Van Calcar|Johannes Stephanus of Calcar]], who provided drawings for Vesalius' earlier tracts. The woodcuts were greatly superior to the illustrations in anatomical atlases of the day, which were never made by anatomy professors themselves.  The woodcut blocks were transported to [[Basel|Basel, Switzerland]], as Vesalius wished that the work be published by one of the foremost printers of the time, [[Johannes Oporinus]]. Vesalius' written directions to Oporinus (the ''iter'') were so valuable the printer decided to include them. The illustrations were engraved on wooden blocks, which allowed for very fine detail.<ref>Brian S. Baigrie ''Scientific Revolutions'', pages 40\u201349 has more information and a translation of Vesalius' preface.</ref>\n\n===1555 edition===\n\nA second edition was published in 1555. Annotations in a copy of that edition donated to the [[Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library]], [[University of Toronto]], have been identified as Vesalius's own, showing that he was contemplating a third edition, never achieved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/u-t-acquires-annotated-copy-vesaliuss-great-anatomical-book |title=U of T acquires annotated copy of Vesalius's great anatomical book |publisher=University of Toronto |date=2013-03-26}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe success of ''Fabrica'' recouped the work's considerable expense, and brought Vesalius European fame, partly through cheap unauthorized copies. He was appointed physician to the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]]; Vesalius presented him with the first published copy (bound in silk of imperial purple, with specially hand-painted illustrations not found in any other copy). To accompany the ''Fabrica'', Vesalius published a condensed and less expensive ''Epitome'': at the time of publication in 1543, it cost 10 [[batzen]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kusukawa |first1=Sachiko |title=De humani corporis fabrica.
