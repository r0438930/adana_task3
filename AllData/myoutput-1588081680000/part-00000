Web.</ref> Koch's discovery of the causative agent of anthrax led to the formation of a generic set of [[wikt:postulate|postulates]] which can be used in the determination of the cause of most infectious diseases.<ref name=\"Germ theory of disease\"/> These postulates, which not only outlined a method for linking cause and effect of an infectious disease but also established the significance of laboratory culture of infectious agents, are listed here:<ref name=\"Germ theory of disease\"/>\n# The organism must always be present, in every case of the disease.\n# The organism must be isolated from a host containing the disease and grown in pure culture.\n# Samples of the organism taken from pure culture must cause the same disease when inoculated into a healthy, susceptible animal in the laboratory.\n# The organism must be isolated from the inoculated animal and must be identified as the same original organism first isolated from the originally diseased host.\n\n====Anthrax====\nRobert Koch is widely known for his work with [[anthrax]], discovering the causative agent of the fatal disease to be ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]''.<ref name=\"Germ theory of disease\" /> He discovered the formation of [[bacterial spore|spores]] in anthrax bacteria, which could remain dormant under specific conditions.<ref name=\"Heinrich Hermann Robert Koch\" /> However, under optimal conditions, the spores were activated and caused disease.<ref name=\"Heinrich Hermann Robert Koch\" /> To determine this causative agent, he dry-fixed bacterial cultures onto glass slides, used dyes to stain the cultures, and observed them through a microscope.<ref name=\"Robert Koch\" /> His work with anthrax is notable in that he was the first to link a specific microorganism with a specific disease, rejecting the idea of [[spontaneous generation]] and supporting the [[germ theory of disease]].<ref name=\"Germ theory of disease\">\"Germ theory of disease.\" ''World of Microbiology and Immunology.''

On December 26, 1900, he arrived as part of an expedition to [[German New Guinea]], which was then a protectorate of the German Reich. Koch serially examined the [[Papuan people]], the indigenous inhabitants, and their blood samples and noticed they contained [[Plasmodium]] parasites, the cause of [[malaria]], but their bouts of malaria were mild or could not even be noticed, i.e. were [[subclinical]]. On the contrary, German settlers and Chinese workers, who had been brought to New Guinea, fell sick immediately. The longer they had stayed in the country, however, the more they too seemed to develop a resistance against it.<ref>{{lang|de|Hugo Kronecker: Hygienische Topographie}} In: A.

On December 26, 1900, he arrived as part of an expedition to [[German New Guinea]], which was then a protectorate of the German Reich. Koch serially examined the [[Papuan people]], the indigenous inhabitants, and their blood samples and noticed they contained [[Plasmodium]] parasites, the cause of [[malaria]], but their bouts of malaria were mild or could not even be noticed, i.e. were [[subclinical]]. On the contrary, German settlers and Chinese workers, who had been brought to New Guinea, fell sick immediately. The longer they had stayed in the country, however, the more they too seemed to develop a resistance against it.<ref>{{lang|de|Hugo Kronecker: Hygienische Topographie}} In: A.
