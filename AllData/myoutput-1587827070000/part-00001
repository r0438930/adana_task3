It is located south of the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] kingdom of [[Bhutan]], in present-day [[West Bengal]].\n\nCooch Behar State was formed when the [[Kamata Kingdom]] under the [[Koch dynasty]] split following the death of [[Nara Narayan]] in 1586. The eastern portion, [[Koch Hajo]], was soon absorbed by [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]]. The western portion, Koch Bihar, formed a separate unit that came under direct challenge by the [[Mughal Empire]]. After weathering the Mughal threat, a new foe emerged in the form of an expansionist Bhutanese kingdom. After a series of wars with the Bhutanese and Tibetans, the Northern threat was pushed back but not before a Bhutanese regent was installed in the royal court. The Koch Bihar court decided to invite British intervention. This came in the form of military assistance that -acting in concert with Koch Bihar forces- ended the Northern challenge once and for all. However the British East India company sought guarantees whereby the independence of Koch Bihar was limited by treaties. When the British colonial rule was finally terminated in India, the Koch Bihar state immediately acceded to and merged with India in 1949 and became a part of [[West Bengal]].  The district, [[Cooch Behar|Cooch Behar District]], is named after this erstwhile kingdom.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history: Mughal interference, Mughal-Koch conflicts (1587\u20131680)===\nThe Kamata kingdom split at a time when the Mughals under [[Akbar]] were aggressively expanding their empire.

He was an ineffectual ruler.  After losing much territory to the Mughal commander Ali Kuli Khan, he accepted Mughal sovereignty and assistance in defending against his neighbours. The next Mughal emperor, [[Jahangir]], again attacked Bihar and captured territory including [[Tripura]]. Lakshmi Narayan went to [[Delhi]] and won guarantees for his much-reduced state.  On his return, he established his capital at the Atharokotha village. Lakshmi Narayan was a patron of scholars and the arts.  He partially restored the [[Mainaguri#Jalpesh Shiva Temple|Shiva Temple of Jalpesh]], but did not complete construction of the temple during his lifetime. Influenced by [[Madhavdeva]], a famous preacher, he made [[Ekasarana dharma]] the state religion.\n\nBir Narayan (1621\u20131626), Lakshmi Narayan's son and successor, was a pleasure-loving ruler who failed to exert his authority to levy taxes on the king of Bhutan. In his peaceful reign, he sponsored schools for the aristocracy and supported intellectuals.  His successor Pran Narayan (1626\u20131665) ruled in peace until 1657, when a struggle for succession in the Mughal empire began between [[Aurangzeb]] and his brothers.  Pran Narayan invaded Bengal, seizing [[Ghoraghat]], a centre of Mughal power in 1658, and in 1661 capturing [[Dhaka]], the Bengali capital. However, by this time Aurangzeb had consolidated his power and sent his armies to invade Bihar and Assam. Pran Narayan retreated to the mountains and waged a guerrilla war for three years, finally making a pact with the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Nawab]] [[Shaista Khan]] in 1664. During his rule, the Behar kingdom expanded to Tajhat Baharband Pargana in the south, Basakpur near Khutaghat of Goalapara district in the east and Bhatgaon within Morang in the west. Thus Koch Bihar maintained its sovereignty [essentially the entire North Bengal] against Mughal invasions.\n\nMaharaja Pran Narayan rebuilt the temples of Baneswar, Shandeswar and the Kamteswari temple of [[Gosanimari]]. He sent for architects from Delhi to complete the Jalpesh temple, but the work was not completed in his lifetime. He constructed broad highways and bridges, and many beautiful buildings in his capital. He was a patron of the arts.\n\nMadan Narayan or Mod Narayan (1665\u20131680) succeeded Pran Narayan after a short struggle with his brothers. For some time, the power behind the throne was Mahi Narayan, who had been Nazir (summoner) for his father. After a fierce struggle, Madan Narayan gained control and Mahi Narayan fled to  Bhutan. Madan Narayan began a survey of his lands and a register of landholdings. He completed the construction of the Jalpesh Shiva temple, providing lands for the temple's maintenance. The Koch Bihar state of his time comprised the entirety of present-day Jalpaiguri division and large parts of [[Maldah division]] of present-day West Bengal. It also included the entire [[Rangpur division]] and large parts of the [[Rajshahi division]] of current Bangladesh. He assisted the Mughals in a war with the [[Ahom kingdom]] in 1666. This strategy helped him keep two competing forces at bay from threatening his holdings.\n\n===Bhutanese invasions, Bhutan-Tibet-Koch conflicts, Bhutanese reversals (1680\u20131772)===\nThe growing power of Bhutan saw the turmoil in Behar and the waning authority of the Mughals as an opportunity to extend their influence. They provided support to competitors for the throne of Koch Bihar, and later attempted outright annexation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.coochbehar.gov.in/Htmfiles/history_book.html |title=Cooch Behar Government: Royal History : Book of Facts and Events C2 p10 \u2013 C3 p11 |access-date=20 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023142432/http://www.coochbehar.gov.in/HTMfiles/history_book.html |archive-date=23 October 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn the death of Madan Narayan with no immediate successor, the sons of the Nazir Mahi Narayan attacked Behar, assisted by the Bhutan army. The [[Raikut|Raikats]] of [[Baikunthapur Forest|Baikunthapur]], distant relatives of the royal family based in the [[Jalpaiguri]] area, sent troops and helped force the Bhutia army to retreat. The Raikats crowned Basudev Narayan (1680\u20131682), Madan Narayan's brother, as Maharajah and helped establish peace before returning to their home. Two years later, Yajna Narayan and Jagat Narayan (sons of Nazir Mahi) attacked Behar again with Bhutanese troops, captured the palace and massacred the royal family, including Basudev Narayan. The Raikats Yogyadev and Bhujdev intervened again, defeating Yajna Narayan in a battle on the banks of the Mansai river. The Raikats then crowned Mahendra Narayan (1682\u20131693), a five-year-old grandson of Pran Narayan, as the next Maharajah.\n\nDuring the minority rule of Mahendra Narayan, the state was unsettled. The lords of places such as Tepa, Manthana Kakina and Karjirhat rejected Bihari rule in place of direct tribute to the Mughal rulers as zamindars (landlords) of their territories. They accepted the authority of, and paid taxes to, Ibrahim Khan the Mughal [[Faujdar]] of [[Ghoraghat]] and [[Dhaka]]. Even the Raikat princes of Baikunthapur and Pangar transferred loyalty to these powers. The Mughals chose this time to attack Behar. With no other choice, Mahendra made a pact with Yajna Narayan and appointed him as Nazir. Aided by the Bhutanese, Yajna Narayan fought the Mughals at [[Patgram Upazila|Patgram]] but was defeated. The Mughals took Boda, Patgram and eastern Pargana in the year 1711. However the Koch warlords offered dogged resistance to Mughal expansion beyond the lower tracts of Rajshahi division. This caused the military frontier to stabilize in the central Malda-Rangpur axis.\n\nMahendra Narayan died at the age of 16. With the main royal line extinct, Rup Narayan (1693\u20131714), a grandson of Nazir Mahi Narayan, became the next Maharajah. Rup Narayan was a strong and popular ruler, but made the mistake of attacking the Mughal Faujdar of Rangpur. Defeated, he lost Karjihat, Kakina and Fatehpur Chakla, retaining only Boda, Patgram and eastern Chakla. Soon after, he lost these territories too, and was reduced to holding the three Chaklas under lease to the Mughals in the name of his Najir. He moved his capital from Atharokotha to a new site,  [[Guriahati]] on the east bank of the [[Torsa River]], where he built a beautiful temple of Sri Madan Mohan Thakur.\n\nUpendra Narayan (1714\u20131763), the next ruler, had no son of his own. He adopted Deena Narayan, the son of dewan Satya Narayan, and gave him considerable powers, but did not formally grant him the succession to the throne. Deena Narayan met the Mughal Faujdar Md. Ali Khan at Rangpur and agreed to accept Mughal supremacy in return for Md. Ali Khan's support in gaining the throne. Md. Ali Khan invaded, but was forced back by a combined army from Behar and Bhutan and had to flee to Rangpur. A joint push by Koch-Ahom-Bhutan forces pushed the Mughals out of Rajshahi. This caused the Mughals to go on the defensive to protect their main flank at Dhaka. Coupled with major Ahom victories to the East, this push removed the Mughal threat from North Bengal for good. However, the Bhutanese took advantage of the situation to occupy some forts in the northern regions of Behar. These forts were later cleared of invaders by Koch warlords based at the Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and Alipurduar tracts.\n\nLate in life, Upendra Narayan's second queen gave birth to a male child, Debendra Narayan (1763\u20131765), who ascended the throne at the age of four. His short reign was chaotic. The Bhutias annexed further land in the north of Behar, and their ambassador in the capital of Behar became the de facto ruler of the state. The young maharaja was assassinated in a palace plot at the age of six.\n\nOn 12 August 1765, the British East India Company took over control of Bengal. The Maharaja of Bihar now had to pay rent to the East India company for Boda, Patgram, Panga and other chaklas in Bengal.\n\nAfter Debendra Narayan's assassination, Debraj, king of Bhutan, sent troops to arrest Rajguru Ramananda Goswami, the leader of the assassination plot. The Behar court agreed to crown Dhairjendra Narayan (1765\u20131770), a cousin of Debendra Narayan, as Maharaja. However, he was a puppet of Bhutan: the Bhutanese ambassador Pensuthma was the effective ruler. Bhutan seized direct control of Behar territories including Jalpeswar, Mandas, Jalash, Lakshmipur, Santarabari, Maraghat and Bholka. During this time there was large scale famine. The court degenerated into intrigues and conspiracies. Eventually, Debraj of Bhutan arrested Dhairjendra Narayan and took him to the Bhutanese capital Punakh, crowning Rajendra Narayan (1770\u20131772) in his place as nominal ruler. After a short \"reign\", Rajendra Narayan died of a fever in 1772.\n\nMaharaja Rajendra Narayan left no heir. The Bhutias attempted to take over direct control, seizing the royal regalia, but the court rebelled and enthroned Dharendra Narayan (1772\u20131775). The Koch warlords once again rallied their banners and chased the Bhutanese-Tibetan-Khampa forces out of the Northern areas of Koch Behar.  Pensuthma -the Bhutanese regent- fled back to Bhutan, whose King sent troops to invade Behar. After some fighting, the Bhutanese regained control and established a new puppet ruler, a child whom they installed in Chekakhata in Bhutan. On his early death, the Bhutias finally attempted direct control, garrisoning forts in strategic positions. However most tracts of the extensive North Bengal region remained fiercely opposed to any Northern control. As, for example, an important warlord \u2014 Rupan Singh of Rahimganj Pargana \u2014 maintained that the Bhutanese presence in North Bengal was illegal and issued directives to the Bhutan court to pull back their forces.\n\n===British East India Company acquires control===\n[[File:Warren Hastings greyscale.jpg|thumb|100px|Warren Hastings, first Governor General of Bengal]]\n\nMaharaja Dharendra Narayan appealed to the British, rulers of Bengal, for assistance in regaining his kingdom in exchange for a large payment. However, the Governor General [[Warren Hastings]] rejected the terms and insisted on an agreement by which the Maharaja would pay an annual tribute to the Company in exchange for protection: in effect an agreement to accept the supremacy of the British. The British then sent a regiment commanded by Mr. Paling from [[Kalikata]] (Calcutta/Kolkata) who marched through Rangpur towards Mughalhat, joined on their route by Behar forces from all the warlords and the chiefs of North Bengal. After a series of sharp encounters with the Bhutanese forces, the British-Koch coalition force captured the capital (1772) and moved forward into southern Bhutan.  \n \nUnwilling to go further into the difficult hill country, the British negotiated a peace agreement (25 April 1774) with Bhutan in exchange for surrender of Bihar royal captives, Bhutan agreeing to return to its pre-1730 boundaries, and a symbolic tribute of five horses. The British left a small garrison in Behar, and withdrew the main army to Rangpur.  When Dhairjendra Narayan realised that he had exchanged one master for another, and had permanently lost independence of his ancestral land, he abdicated in favour of Dharendra Narayan, who reigned until his death in 1775, when Dhairjendra Narayan resumed the throne (1775\u20131783)\n\nFrom now on, until the transfer of control to the State of India in 1949, Koch Behar was a [[princely state]] subject to overall British Suzerainty. In 1949, it was merged with the [[Dominion of India|Union of India]] and later became a part of [[West Bengal]] state. Alternatively if it had acceded to East Pakistan (now [[Bangladesh]]) then India would not have had land access to North-east India and that territory would have seceded to independence. Also the former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) would have land borders with Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.coochbehar.gov.in/Htmfiles/history_book.html |title=Cooch Behar Government: Royal History : Book of Facts and Events C3 p11 \u2013 C6 |access-date=20 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023142432/http://www.coochbehar.gov.in/HTMfiles/history_book.html |archive-date=23 October 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSubsequent princely rulers under the British East India company were Harendra Narayan (1783\u20131839), followed by Shivendra Narayan (1839\u20131847) and then by Narendra Narayan (1847\u20131863).\n\n===Rulers===\n{{main|Koch dynasty}}\nThe rulers of Cooch Behar State held the title of '[[Maharaja]]' from 1884 onwards.

It is located south of the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] kingdom of [[Bhutan]], in present-day [[West Bengal]].\n\nCooch Behar State was formed when the [[Kamata Kingdom]] under the [[Koch dynasty]] split following the death of [[Nara Narayan]] in 1586. The eastern portion, [[Koch Hajo]], was soon absorbed by [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]]. The western portion, Koch Bihar, formed a separate unit that came under direct challenge by the [[Mughal Empire]]. After weathering the Mughal threat, a new foe emerged in the form of an expansionist Bhutanese kingdom. After a series of wars with the Bhutanese and Tibetans, the Northern threat was pushed back but not before a Bhutanese regent was installed in the royal court. The Koch Bihar court decided to invite British intervention. This came in the form of military assistance that -acting in concert with Koch Bihar forces- ended the Northern challenge once and for all. However the British East India company sought guarantees whereby the independence of Koch Bihar was limited by treaties. When the British colonial rule was finally terminated in India, the Koch Bihar state immediately acceded to and merged with India in 1949 and became a part of [[West Bengal]].  The district, [[Cooch Behar|Cooch Behar District]], is named after this erstwhile kingdom.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history: Mughal interference, Mughal-Koch conflicts (1587\u20131680)===\nThe Kamata kingdom split at a time when the Mughals under [[Akbar]] were aggressively expanding their empire.

He was an ineffectual ruler.  After losing much territory to the Mughal commander Ali Kuli Khan, he accepted Mughal sovereignty and assistance in defending against his neighbours. The next Mughal emperor, [[Jahangir]], again attacked Bihar and captured territory including [[Tripura]]. Lakshmi Narayan went to [[Delhi]] and won guarantees for his much-reduced state.  On his return, he established his capital at the Atharokotha village. Lakshmi Narayan was a patron of scholars and the arts.  He partially restored the [[Mainaguri#Jalpesh Shiva Temple|Shiva Temple of Jalpesh]], but did not complete construction of the temple during his lifetime. Influenced by [[Madhavdeva]], a famous preacher, he made [[Ekasarana dharma]] the state religion.\n\nBir Narayan (1621\u20131626), Lakshmi Narayan's son and successor, was a pleasure-loving ruler who failed to exert his authority to levy taxes on the king of Bhutan. In his peaceful reign, he sponsored schools for the aristocracy and supported intellectuals.  His successor Pran Narayan (1626\u20131665) ruled in peace until 1657, when a struggle for succession in the Mughal empire began between [[Aurangzeb]] and his brothers.  Pran Narayan invaded Bengal, seizing [[Ghoraghat]], a centre of Mughal power in 1658, and in 1661 capturing [[Dhaka]], the Bengali capital. However, by this time Aurangzeb had consolidated his power and sent his armies to invade Bihar and Assam. Pran Narayan retreated to the mountains and waged a guerrilla war for three years, finally making a pact with the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Nawab]] [[Shaista Khan]] in 1664. During his rule, the Behar kingdom expanded to Tajhat Baharband Pargana in the south, Basakpur near Khutaghat of Goalapara district in the east and Bhatgaon within Morang in the west. Thus Koch Bihar maintained its sovereignty [essentially the entire North Bengal] against Mughal invasions.\n\nMaharaja Pran Narayan rebuilt the temples of Baneswar, Shandeswar and the Kamteswari temple of [[Gosanimari]]. He sent for architects from Delhi to complete the Jalpesh temple, but the work was not completed in his lifetime. He constructed broad highways and bridges, and many beautiful buildings in his capital. He was a patron of the arts.\n\nMadan Narayan or Mod Narayan (1665\u20131680) succeeded Pran Narayan after a short struggle with his brothers. For some time, the power behind the throne was Mahi Narayan, who had been Nazir (summoner) for his father. After a fierce struggle, Madan Narayan gained control and Mahi Narayan fled to  Bhutan. Madan Narayan began a survey of his lands and a register of landholdings. He completed the construction of the Jalpesh Shiva temple, providing lands for the temple's maintenance. The Koch Bihar state of his time comprised the entirety of present-day Jalpaiguri division and large parts of [[Maldah division]] of present-day West Bengal. It also included the entire [[Rangpur division]] and large parts of the [[Rajshahi division]] of current Bangladesh. He assisted the Mughals in a war with the [[Ahom kingdom]] in 1666. This strategy helped him keep two competing forces at bay from threatening his holdings.\n\n===Bhutanese invasions, Bhutan-Tibet-Koch conflicts, Bhutanese reversals (1680\u20131772)===\nThe growing power of Bhutan saw the turmoil in Behar and the waning authority of the Mughals as an opportunity to extend their influence. They provided support to competitors for the throne of Koch Bihar, and later attempted outright annexation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.coochbehar.gov.in/Htmfiles/history_book.html |title=Cooch Behar Government: Royal History : Book of Facts and Events C2 p10 \u2013 C3 p11 |access-date=20 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023142432/http://www.coochbehar.gov.in/HTMfiles/history_book.html |archive-date=23 October 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn the death of Madan Narayan with no immediate successor, the sons of the Nazir Mahi Narayan attacked Behar, assisted by the Bhutan army. The [[Raikut|Raikats]] of [[Baikunthapur Forest|Baikunthapur]], distant relatives of the royal family based in the [[Jalpaiguri]] area, sent troops and helped force the Bhutia army to retreat. The Raikats crowned Basudev Narayan (1680\u20131682), Madan Narayan's brother, as Maharajah and helped establish peace before returning to their home. Two years later, Yajna Narayan and Jagat Narayan (sons of Nazir Mahi) attacked Behar again with Bhutanese troops, captured the palace and massacred the royal family, including Basudev Narayan. The Raikats Yogyadev and Bhujdev intervened again, defeating Yajna Narayan in a battle on the banks of the Mansai river. The Raikats then crowned Mahendra Narayan (1682\u20131693), a five-year-old grandson of Pran Narayan, as the next Maharajah.\n\nDuring the minority rule of Mahendra Narayan, the state was unsettled. The lords of places such as Tepa, Manthana Kakina and Karjirhat rejected Bihari rule in place of direct tribute to the Mughal rulers as zamindars (landlords) of their territories. They accepted the authority of, and paid taxes to, Ibrahim Khan the Mughal [[Faujdar]] of [[Ghoraghat]] and [[Dhaka]]. Even the Raikat princes of Baikunthapur and Pangar transferred loyalty to these powers. The Mughals chose this time to attack Behar. With no other choice, Mahendra made a pact with Yajna Narayan and appointed him as Nazir. Aided by the Bhutanese, Yajna Narayan fought the Mughals at [[Patgram Upazila|Patgram]] but was defeated. The Mughals took Boda, Patgram and eastern Pargana in the year 1711. However the Koch warlords offered dogged resistance to Mughal expansion beyond the lower tracts of Rajshahi division. This caused the military frontier to stabilize in the central Malda-Rangpur axis.\n\nMahendra Narayan died at the age of 16. With the main royal line extinct, Rup Narayan (1693\u20131714), a grandson of Nazir Mahi Narayan, became the next Maharajah. Rup Narayan was a strong and popular ruler, but made the mistake of attacking the Mughal Faujdar of Rangpur. Defeated, he lost Karjihat, Kakina and Fatehpur Chakla, retaining only Boda, Patgram and eastern Chakla. Soon after, he lost these territories too, and was reduced to holding the three Chaklas under lease to the Mughals in the name of his Najir. He moved his capital from Atharokotha to a new site,  [[Guriahati]] on the east bank of the [[Torsa River]], where he built a beautiful temple of Sri Madan Mohan Thakur.\n\nUpendra Narayan (1714\u20131763), the next ruler, had no son of his own. He adopted Deena Narayan, the son of dewan Satya Narayan, and gave him considerable powers, but did not formally grant him the succession to the throne. Deena Narayan met the Mughal Faujdar Md. Ali Khan at Rangpur and agreed to accept Mughal supremacy in return for Md. Ali Khan's support in gaining the throne. Md. Ali Khan invaded, but was forced back by a combined army from Behar and Bhutan and had to flee to Rangpur. A joint push by Koch-Ahom-Bhutan forces pushed the Mughals out of Rajshahi. This caused the Mughals to go on the defensive to protect their main flank at Dhaka. Coupled with major Ahom victories to the East, this push removed the Mughal threat from North Bengal for good. However, the Bhutanese took advantage of the situation to occupy some forts in the northern regions of Behar. These forts were later cleared of invaders by Koch warlords based at the Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and Alipurduar tracts.\n\nLate in life, Upendra Narayan's second queen gave birth to a male child, Debendra Narayan (1763\u20131765), who ascended the throne at the age of four. His short reign was chaotic. The Bhutias annexed further land in the north of Behar, and their ambassador in the capital of Behar became the de facto ruler of the state. The young maharaja was assassinated in a palace plot at the age of six.\n\nOn 12 August 1765, the British East India Company took over control of Bengal. The Maharaja of Bihar now had to pay rent to the East India company for Boda, Patgram, Panga and other chaklas in Bengal.\n\nAfter Debendra Narayan's assassination, Debraj, king of Bhutan, sent troops to arrest Rajguru Ramananda Goswami, the leader of the assassination plot. The Behar court agreed to crown Dhairjendra Narayan (1765\u20131770), a cousin of Debendra Narayan, as Maharaja. However, he was a puppet of Bhutan: the Bhutanese ambassador Pensuthma was the effective ruler. Bhutan seized direct control of Behar territories including Jalpeswar, Mandas, Jalash, Lakshmipur, Santarabari, Maraghat and Bholka. During this time there was large scale famine. The court degenerated into intrigues and conspiracies. Eventually, Debraj of Bhutan arrested Dhairjendra Narayan and took him to the Bhutanese capital Punakh, crowning Rajendra Narayan (1770\u20131772) in his place as nominal ruler. After a short \"reign\", Rajendra Narayan died of a fever in 1772.\n\nMaharaja Rajendra Narayan left no heir. The Bhutias attempted to take over direct control, seizing the royal regalia, but the court rebelled and enthroned Dharendra Narayan (1772\u20131775). The Koch warlords once again rallied their banners and chased the Bhutanese-Tibetan-Khampa forces out of the Northern areas of Koch Behar.  Pensuthma -the Bhutanese regent- fled back to Bhutan, whose King sent troops to invade Behar. After some fighting, the Bhutanese regained control and established a new puppet ruler, a child whom they installed in Chekakhata in Bhutan. On his early death, the Bhutias finally attempted direct control, garrisoning forts in strategic positions. However most tracts of the extensive North Bengal region remained fiercely opposed to any Northern control. As, for example, an important warlord \u2014 Rupan Singh of Rahimganj Pargana \u2014 maintained that the Bhutanese presence in North Bengal was illegal and issued directives to the Bhutan court to pull back their forces.\n\n===British East India Company acquires control===\n[[File:Warren Hastings greyscale.jpg|thumb|100px|Warren Hastings, first Governor General of Bengal]]\n\nMaharaja Dharendra Narayan appealed to the British, rulers of Bengal, for assistance in regaining his kingdom in exchange for a large payment. However, the Governor General [[Warren Hastings]] rejected the terms and insisted on an agreement by which the Maharaja would pay an annual tribute to the Company in exchange for protection: in effect an agreement to accept the supremacy of the British. The British then sent a regiment commanded by Mr. Paling from [[Kalikata]] (Calcutta/Kolkata) who marched through Rangpur towards Mughalhat, joined on their route by Behar forces from all the warlords and the chiefs of North Bengal. After a series of sharp encounters with the Bhutanese forces, the British-Koch coalition force captured the capital (1772) and moved forward into southern Bhutan.  \n \nUnwilling to go further into the difficult hill country, the British negotiated a peace agreement (25 April 1774) with Bhutan in exchange for surrender of Bihar royal captives, Bhutan agreeing to return to its pre-1730 boundaries, and a symbolic tribute of five horses. The British left a small garrison in Behar, and withdrew the main army to Rangpur.  When Dhairjendra Narayan realised that he had exchanged one master for another, and had permanently lost independence of his ancestral land, he abdicated in favour of Dharendra Narayan, who reigned until his death in 1775, when Dhairjendra Narayan resumed the throne (1775\u20131783)\n\nFrom now on, until the transfer of control to the State of India in 1949, Koch Behar was a [[princely state]] subject to overall British Suzerainty. In 1949, it was merged with the Union of India and later became a part of [[West Bengal]] state. Alternatively if it had acceded to East Pakistan (now [[Bangladesh]]) then India would not have had land access to North-east India and that territory would have seceded to independence. Also the former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) would have land borders with Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.coochbehar.gov.in/Htmfiles/history_book.html |title=Cooch Behar Government: Royal History : Book of Facts and Events C3 p11 \u2013 C6 |access-date=20 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023142432/http://www.coochbehar.gov.in/HTMfiles/history_book.html |archive-date=23 October 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSubsequent princely rulers under the British East India company were Harendra Narayan (1783\u20131839), followed by Shivendra Narayan (1839\u20131847) and then by Narendra Narayan (1847\u20131863).\n\n===Rulers===\n{{main|Koch dynasty}}\nThe rulers of Cooch Behar State held the title of '[[Maharaja]]' from 1884 onwards.
