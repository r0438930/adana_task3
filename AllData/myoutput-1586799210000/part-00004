The film follows, SK (played by Sivakarthikeyan) an aspiring actor, who decides to don as a female nurse, to test his acting skills and also to win the hearts of his lady love, who is a doctor by profession.\n\nThis is the debut film produced by R.

Raja, who earlier worked as a creative producer for Sivakarthikeyan, in his movies [[Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam|''Varuthapadatha'' ''Vaalibar Sangam'']]'', [[Maan Karate]]'', ''[[Kaaki Sattai|Kakki Sattai]]'' and ''[[Rajini Murugan]].'' Earlier he started his career a promotion consultant, for movies [[Boss Engira Bhaskaran|''Boss Engira Baskaran'']], ''[[Enthiran]]'' and ''[[Jilla]]''. The film was initially scheduled to release on 14 March 2015, but was briefly delayed due to the script completion, and finalizing the cast and crew. The project was started, with the announcement of technical crew on 1 July 2015.<ref name=\":2\" /> Principal photography of this film, took place on 25 October 2015, in Chennai, and continued till 2 August 2016;<ref name=\":3\" /> Filming was held in Chennai, Vizag and Pondicherry. The film's title ''Remo'' was announced on February 2016.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe film had a worldwide theatrical release on 7 October 2016, coinciding with the occasion of [[Vijayadashami|Dusshera]] festival. The film received mixed to positive  reviews from critics, praising Sivakarthikeyan's acting in the role of a female nurse, and the efforts he took for donning the make over. However, the film faced criticism for glorifying stalking and the way in which Keerthy Suresh's character was written for the film. It became a commercial success grossing {{Indian Rupee|76}} crore, amidst the budget of {{Indian Rupee|35}} crore.<ref name=\":5\" /> The film was dubbed into [[Telugu language|Telugu]] under the same title, and was released on 25 November 2016. It was remade in Odia as ''[[Sister Sridevi]]'' (2017).\n\n== Plot ==\nSiva aka S.K ([[Sivakarthikeyan]]) is a theatre actor whose only aim is to become a superstar like [[Rajinikanth]]. However, his lack of acting out romantic scenes hinders his path to the dream, and is even rejected by director [[K. S. Ravikumar]] during the audition for his new film ''[[Avvai Shanmugi]] 2''. He comes across Kavya ([[Keerthy Suresh]]), who is a doctor, and instantly falls in love with her. He goes to her house to propose his love, only to find out that she is engaged to a [[Pune]]-based doctor named Vishwanath alias Vishwa ([[Anson Paul]]). Siva, though becoming disappointed, decides to woo Kavya anyway and somehow break her engagement with Vishwa. He disguises himself as a nurse, going by the name of \"Remo\" (short for \"Regina Motwani\", a combination of the names of actresses [[Regina Cassandra]] and [[Hansika Motwani]]), and takes up a job in the same hospital where Kavya works.\n\nEnsuring that Kavya never finds out his true identity, Siva as Remo establishes a close friendship with her but is unable to convince her to end her engagement with Vishwa. Undeterred, he organizes a massive surprise on her birthday and proposes to her as Siva. Kavya, who has been charmed by the surprise and fallen in love with Siva, is in a dilemma as she is unable to decide between Vishwa and Siva. Siva takes advantage of her dilemma and juggles the roles of both Siva as well as Remo with the aim of breaking her engagement, all the while hiding his dual identity from her. Eventually, Kavya gives in and admits her feelings to Siva, but, to the shock of both her and Siva, Vishwa has decided to prepone their marriage to the very next day because Vishwa saw Kavya enjoying with Siva. Kavya decides to end her engagement and leave her house to be with Siva. While Kavya pours out her feelings to Siva (who is disguised as Remo), Vishwa arrives with some goons to forcibly take her away.It was also shown early that Vishwa had only lust for Kavya as she was very beautiful.  Siva, still in his Remo guise, thrashes Vishwa and his goons, but at the same moment, he is forced to rush to the hospital to attend to a terminally-ill orphan named Nancy (Baby Raksha), with whom he had established a close bond. On Nancy's cajoling (Siva as Remo has earlier promised her that he would \"change himself\" to a man as a \"magic trick\"), Siva removes his Remo disguise, exposing his identity to Kavya. Betrayed and hurt, Kavya berates Siva for cheating her and ending her engagement and warns him never to go behind her again. Despite Siva's repeated pleas, Kavya refuses to budge and Siva sadly walks away.\n\nA few months later, an old man sits next to Kavya in a bus. Kavya tells her latest problem to him: Siva is still attracted to her and constantly calls her, despite her having changed her number 46 times. However, she also adds that she still loves Siva and is only avoiding him as she wants to punish him for cheating her earlier. At this juncture, she accidentally finds out that the old man is none other than Siva in disguise. After scolding Siva for cheating her yet again, she softens and asks him to marry her, to which he happily agrees.\n\nThe film ends with Siva finally achieving his dream: acting along with his best friend Vallikanth ([[Sathish]]) in a movie which seems to be his life story named ''Remo Nee Kadhalan'' (''Remo O Premikudu'' and ''Remo Ninda Premam'' in Telugu and Malayalam versions), directed by K. S. Ravikumar, in which actress [[Sri Divya]] plays the role of Kavya as Dr. Divya.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Siva Karthikeyan \"Siva\"/\"SK\", Regina Motwani \"Remo\" and Thatha\n*[[Keerthy Suresh]] as Dr. Kavya\n*[[Sathish]] as Vallikanth\n*[[K.

I don't see myself taking up such an experiment again. I couldn't afford to look hefty in the nurse look and had to become really lean. I stopped gymming for about 7 months and lost up to 9 kilos. I had to look cute in this look and match Keerthy's age, too. Also, for these portions, I dubbed for just five minutes of footage each day. I took about 4 to 5 hours each day in the morning to complete this. I used to shuttle from my house in ECR to Prasad Labs daily.

The film follows, SK (played by Sivakarthikeyan) an aspiring actor, who decides to don as a female nurse, to test his acting skills and also to win the hearts of his lady love, who is a doctor by profession.\n\nThis is the debut film produced by R.

Earlier he started his career a promotion consultant, for movies [[Boss Engira Bhaskaran|''Boss Engira Baskaran'']], ''[[Enthiran]]'' and ''[[Jilla]]''. The film was initially scheduled to release on 14 March 2015, but was briefly delayed due to the script completion, and finalizing the cast and crew. The project was started, with the announcement of technical crew on 1 July 2015.<ref name=\":2\" /> Principal photography of this film, took place on 25 October 2015, in Chennai, and continued till 2 August 2016;<ref name=\":3\" /> Filming was held in Chennai, Vizag and Pondicherry. The film's title ''Remo'' was announced on February 2016.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe film had a worldwide theatrical release on 7 October 2016, coinciding with the occasion of [[Vijayadashami|Dusshera]] festival. The film received mixed to positive  reviews from critics, praising Sivakarthikeyan's acting in the role of a female nurse, and the efforts he took for donning the make over. However, the film faced criticism for glorifying stalking and the way in which Keerthy Suresh's character was written for the film. It became a commercial success grossing {{Indian Rupee|76}} crore, amidst the budget of {{Indian Rupee|35}} crore.<ref name=\":5\" /> The film was dubbed into [[Telugu language|Telugu]] under the same title, and was released on 25 November 2016. It was remade in Odia as ''[[Sister Sridevi]]'' (2017).\n\n== Plot ==\nSiva aka S.K ([[Sivakarthikeyan]]) is a theatre actor whose only aim is to become a superstar like [[Rajinikanth]]. However, his lack of acting out romantic scenes hinders his path to the dream, and is even rejected by director [[K. S. Ravikumar]] during the audition for his new film ''[[Avvai Shanmugi]] 2''. He comes across Kavya ([[Keerthy Suresh]]), who is a doctor, and instantly falls in love with her. He goes to her house to propose his love, only to find out that she is engaged to a [[Pune]]-based doctor named Vishwanath alias Vishwa ([[Anson Paul]]). Siva, though becoming disappointed, decides to woo Kavya anyway and somehow break her engagement with Vishwa. He disguises himself as a nurse, going by the name of \"Remo\" (short for \"Regina Motwani\", a combination of the names of actresses [[Regina Cassandra]] and [[Hansika Motwani]]), and takes up a job in the same hospital where Kavya works.\n\nEnsuring that Kavya never finds out his true identity, Siva as Remo establishes a close friendship with her but is unable to convince her to end her engagement with Vishwa. Undeterred, he organizes a massive surprise on her birthday and proposes to her as Siva. Kavya, who has been charmed by the surprise and fallen in love with Siva, is in a dilemma as she is unable to decide between Vishwa and Siva. Siva takes advantage of her dilemma and juggles the roles of both Siva as well as Remo with the aim of breaking her engagement, all the while hiding his dual identity from her. Eventually, Kavya gives in and admits her feelings to Siva, but, to the shock of both her and Siva, Vishwa has decided to prepone their marriage to the very next day because Vishwa saw Kavya enjoying with Siva. Kavya decides to end her engagement and leave her house to be with Siva. While Kavya pours out her feelings to Siva (who is disguised as Remo), Vishwa arrives with some goons to forcibly take her away.It was also shown early that Vishwa had only lust for Kavya as she was very beautiful.  Siva, still in his Remo guise, thrashes Vishwa and his goons, but at the same moment, he is forced to rush to the hospital to attend to a terminally-ill orphan named Nancy (Baby Raksha), with whom he had established a close bond. On Nancy's cajoling (Siva as Remo has earlier promised her that he would \"change himself\" to a man as a \"magic trick\"), Siva removes his Remo disguise, exposing his identity to Kavya. Betrayed and hurt, Kavya berates Siva for cheating her and ending her engagement and warns him never to go behind her again. Despite Siva's repeated pleas, Kavya refuses to budge and Siva sadly walks away.\n\nA few months later, an old man sits next to Kavya in a bus. Kavya tells her latest problem to him: Siva is still attracted to her and constantly calls her, despite her having changed her number 46 times. However, she also adds that she still loves Siva and is only avoiding him as she wants to punish him for cheating her earlier. At this juncture, she accidentally finds out that the old man is none other than Siva in disguise. After scolding Siva for cheating her yet again, she softens and asks him to marry her, to which he happily agrees.\n\nThe film ends with Siva finally achieving his dream: acting along with his best friend Vallikanth ([[Sathish]]) in a movie which seems to be his life story named ''Remo Nee Kadhalan'' (''Remo O Premikudu'' and ''Remo Ninda Premam'' in Telugu and Malayalam versions), directed by K. S. Ravikumar, in which actress [[Sri Divya]] plays the role of Kavya as Dr. Divya.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Siva Karthikeyan \"Siva\"/\"SK\", Regina Motwani \"Remo\" and Thatha\n*[[Keerthy Suresh]] as Dr. Kavya\n*[[Sathish]] as Vallikanth\n*[[K.
