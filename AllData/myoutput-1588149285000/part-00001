In this article, notable first ascents of hard routes and boulders are listed, which are regarded worldwide as milestones in the history of [[free climbing]].\n\n[[Grade (climbing)|Ratings]] on the hardest climbs tend to be speculative, until other climbers have had a chance to complete the routes and a consensus can be reached on the precise [[Grade (climbing)|grade]]. This becomes increasingly difficult as the grade increases, because fewer climbers are capable of repeating the route and passing judgment on its grade.\n[[File:Adam Ondra climbing Silence, 9c by PAVEL BLAZEK 1-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|[[Adam Ondra]] climbing [[#Redpointed|''Silence'']], {{Climbing grade|9c}}, in 2017]]\n\n== Overview ==\nAs of April 2019:\n* The hardest ascended route ([[#Redpointed|''Silence'']]) has a proposed grade of {{climbing grade|9c}}.
