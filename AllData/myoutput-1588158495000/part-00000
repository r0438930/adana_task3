It was based at a former railway works in [[Horwich]], six miles to the west of [[Bolton]].

Each of the five services introduced to give this combined frequency served a different estate in Horwich. A 20-minute service along Chorley Old Road from Bolton to the Johnson Fold estate was next to be introduced, followed by a series of routes in [[Wigan]]. The first of these ran to [[Shevington]]. It was decided to open an outpost at [[Appley Bridge]] to act as a local base for the Wigan routes.<ref name=\"Blue Bus History\" />\n\nNew routes were added to the network following contract wins, and a number of commercial routes were also introduced, taking the company into new areas such as [[Manchester]]. In addition, the company gained work from a holiday company, Alfa Tours. Five coaches were acquired for this, with two were specially branded for Alfa.<ref name=\"Blue Bus History\" />\n\nBlue Bus purchased a depot in [[Huddersfield]] in August 1994, launching a service to [[Marsden, West Yorkshire|Marsden]] in competition with [[Yorkshire Rider]]. This venture was later expanded into [[Bradford]]. Rider was taken over by [[FirstGroup|FirstBus]] in 1996, and Blue Bus' West Yorkshire operation ceased. Just weeks later, [[FirstGroup|FirstBus]] took over Blue Bus's main [[Bolton]] rival, [[First Greater Manchester|GM Buses North]].<ref name=\"Blue Bus History\" />\n\nDuring 2001, after [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]] sold the East [[Lancashire]] end of [[Ribble Motor Services]] company to [[Transdev Blazefield|Blazefield]], Blue Bus started intensive competition against newly formed [[Blackburn Bus Company|Lancashire United]] in the Bolton area. Blue Bus took over operation of the Bolton end of Lancashire United in August 2002, acquiring the former Ribble depot, staff, services and several vehicles. The head office was moved to the former Lancashire United office at [[Bolton bus station]], and the [[Horwich]] base was later closed down, with most buses moving to [[Bolton]]. This acquisition saw rivalry develop between Blue Bus and FirstBus, with Blue Bus moving onto the 400 TransLancs Express service and introducing an X9 express service into [[Manchester]]. Both companies eventually withdrew and the services were withdrawn.<ref name=\"Blue Bus History\" />\n\nIn early 2005, Blue Bus sold its Appley Bridge depot to [[Diamond Bus North West|South Lancs Travel]] along with six buses and all of the depot's routes. This allowed the company to focus on its depots in [[Bolton]] and [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]], with a proposal to expand further having gained tenders in [[City of Salford|Salford]] and [[Manchester]] on eight routes.<ref name=\"Blue Bus History\" />\n\nOn 31 July 2005, Blue Bus was acquired by [[Arriva North West & Wales]].<ref name=\"Blue Bus History\" /><ref>[http://www.arriva.co.uk/about_arriva/history_growth/timeline_html.aspx?sc_lang=en Timeline] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818235702/http://www.arriva.co.uk/about_arriva/history_growth/timeline_html.aspx?sc_lang=en |date=18 August 2014 }} Arriva</ref>\n\n==Services operated==\n\nBlue Bus operated numerous bus services, including the following:\n\n6: Bolton -
