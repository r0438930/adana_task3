While carbon footprints are usually reported in tons of emissions (CO2-equivalent) per year, ecological footprints are usually reported in comparison to what the planet can renew. This assesses the number of \"earths\" that would be required if everyone on the planet consumed resources at the same level as the person calculating their ecological footprint. The carbon footprint is one part of the ecological footprint. The carbon part was popularized by a large campaign of [[BP]] in 2005.<ref name=Safire2008/> Carbon footprints are more focused than ecological footprints since they measure merely emissions of gases that cause climate change into the atmosphere.\n\nCarbon footprint is one of a family of footprint indicators, which also include [[water footprint]] and [[land footprint]].\n\n== Direct carbon emissions ==\nDirect carbon emissions come from sources that are directly from the site that is producing a product.<ref name=\":1\" /> These emissions can also be referred to as scope 1 and scope 2 emissions.\n\nScope 1 emissions are emissions that are directly emitted from the site of the process or service.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Accounting for Carbon Monitoring, Reporting and Verifying Emissions in the Climate Economy|last=Bellassen|first=Valentin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015|isbn=9781316162262|location=|pages=6}}</ref> An example for industry would be the emissions related to burning a fuel on site.

Exchanging two-thirds of the animal protein with plant protein is roughly equivalent to switching from a Toyota Camry to a Prius. Finally, throwing food out not only adds its associated carbon emissions to a person or household's footprint, but it also adds the emissions of transporting the wasted food to the garbage dump and the emissions of food decomposition, mostly in the form of the highly potent greenhouse gas, methane.\n\nOptions to reduce the carbon footprint of humans include [[Waste hierarchy|Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Refuse]]. This can be done by using reusable items such as thermoses for daily coffee or plastic containers for water and other cold beverages rather than disposable ones.

By calculating or predicting a process\u2019 carbon footprint high emissions areas can be identified and steps can be taken to reduce in those areas.\n\n== Schemes to reduce carbon emissions: Kyoto Protocol, carbon offsetting, and certificates ==\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, and the emissions of other GHGs, are often associated with the burning of fossil fuels, like natural gas, crude oil and coal. While this is harmful to the environment, [[carbon offset]]s can be purchased in an attempt to make up for these harmful effects.\n\nThe [[Kyoto Protocol]] defines legally binding targets and timetables for cutting the GHG emissions of industrialized countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol. Accordingly, from an economic or market perspective, one has to distinguish between a ''mandatory market'' and a ''voluntary market''. Typical for both markets is the trade with emission certificates:\n\n*[[Certified Emission Reduction]] (CER)\n*[[Emission Reduction Unit]] (ERU)\n*[[Verified Emission Reduction]] (VER)\n\n=== Mandatory market mechanisms ===\nTo reach the goals defined in the Kyoto Protocol, with the least economical costs, the following [[Flexible Mechanisms|flexible mechanisms]] were introduced for the mandatory market:\n\n*[[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM)\n*[[Joint Implementation]] (JI)\n*[[Emissions trading]]\n\nThe CDM and JI mechanisms requirements for projects which create a supply of emission reduction instruments, while [[Emissions Trading]] allows those instruments to be sold on international markets.\n\n* Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the CDM mechanism generate [[Certified Emissions Reduction]]s (CERs).\n* Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the JI mechanism generate [[Emission Reduction Unit]]s (ERUs).\n\nThe CERs and ERUs can then be sold through [[Emissions Trading]]. The demand for the CERs and ERUs being traded is driven by:\n\n* Shortfalls in national emission reduction obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.\n* Shortfalls amongst entities obligated under local emissions reduction schemes.\n\nNations which have failed to deliver their Kyoto emissions reductions obligations can enter [[Emissions Trading]] to purchase CERs and ERUs to cover their treaty shortfalls.  Nations and groups of nations can also create local emission reduction schemes which place mandatory carbon dioxide emission targets on entities within their national boundaries.  If the rules of a scheme allow, the obligated entities may be able to cover all or some of any reduction shortfalls by purchasing CERs and ERUs through [[Emissions Trading]].  While local emissions reduction schemes have no status under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] itself, they play a prominent role in creating the demand for CERs and ERUs, stimulating [[Emissions Trading]] and setting a [[market price]] for emissions.\n\nA well-known mandatory local emissions trading scheme is the [[EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS).\n\nNew changes are being made to the trading schemes. The [[EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] is set to make some new changes within the next year. The new changes will target the emissions produced by flight travel in and out of the European Union.<ref name=\"Callick, Rowan 2011\">Callick, Rowan. \"Nations Split on Route to Reduce Carbon Emissions.\" The Australian. 2 March 2011. Web. 1 March 2011.</ref>\n\nOther nations are scheduled to start participating in Emissions Trading Schemes within the next few years. These nations include China, India and the United States.<ref name=\"Callick, Rowan 2011\" />\n\n=== Voluntary market mechanisms ===\nIn contrast to the strict rules set out for the mandatory market, the voluntary market provides companies with different options to acquire emissions reductions. A solution, comparable with those developed for the mandatory market, has been developed for the voluntary market, the Verified Emission Reductions (VER). This measure has the great advantage that the projects/activities are managed according to the quality standards set out for CDM/JI projects but the certificates provided are not registered by the governments of the host countries or the Executive Board of the UNO. As such, high quality VERs can be acquired at lower costs for the same project quality. However, at present VERs can not be used in mandatory market.\n\nThe voluntary market in North America is divided between members of the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Over The Counter (OTC) market. The [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] is a voluntary yet legally binding [[emissions trading|cap-and-trade emission scheme]] whereby members commit to the capped emission reductions and must purchase allowances from other members or offset excess emissions. The OTC market does not involve a legally binding scheme and a wide array of buyers from the public and private spheres, as well as special events that want to go [[carbon neutral]]. Being carbon neutral refers to achieving net zero carbon emissions by balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset, or buying enough carbon credits to make up the difference.\n\nThere are project developers, wholesalers, brokers, and retailers, as well as carbon funds, in the voluntary market. Some businesses and nonprofits in the voluntary market encompass more than just one of the activities listed above.

By calculating or predicting a process\u2019 carbon footprint high emissions areas can be identified and steps can be taken to reduce in those areas.\n\n== Schemes to reduce carbon emissions: Kyoto Protocol, carbon offsetting, and certificates ==\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, and the emissions of other GHGs, are often associated with the burning of fossil fuels, like natural gas, crude oil and coal. While this is harmful to the environment, [[carbon offset]]s can be purchased in an attempt to make up for these harmful effects.\n\nThe [[Kyoto Protocol]] defines legally binding targets and timetables for cutting the GHG emissions of industrialized countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol. Accordingly, from an economic or market perspective, one has to distinguish between a ''mandatory market'' and a ''voluntary market''. Typical for both markets is the trade with emission certificates:\n\n*[[Certified Emission Reduction]] (CER)\n*[[Emission Reduction Unit]] (ERU)\n*[[Verified Emission Reduction]] (VER)\n\n=== Mandatory market mechanisms ===\nTo reach the goals defined in the Kyoto Protocol, with the least economical costs, the following [[Flexible Mechanisms|flexible mechanisms]] were introduced for the mandatory market:\n\n*[[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM)\n*[[Joint Implementation]] (JI)\n*[[Emissions trading]]\n\nThe CDM and JI mechanisms requirements for projects which create a supply of emission reduction instruments, while [[Emissions Trading]] allows those instruments to be sold on international markets.\n\n* Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the CDM mechanism generate [[Certified Emissions Reduction]]s (CERs).\n* Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the JI mechanism generate [[Emission Reduction Unit]]s (ERUs).\n\nThe CERs and ERUs can then be sold through [[Emissions Trading]]. The demand for the CERs and ERUs being traded is driven by:\n\n* Shortfalls in national emission reduction obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.\n* Shortfalls amongst entities obligated under local emissions reduction schemes.\n\nNations which have failed to deliver their Kyoto emissions reductions obligations can enter [[Emissions Trading]] to purchase CERs and ERUs to cover their treaty shortfalls.  Nations and groups of nations can also create local emission reduction schemes which place mandatory carbon dioxide emission targets on entities within their national boundaries.  If the rules of a scheme allow, the obligated entities may be able to cover all or some of any reduction shortfalls by purchasing CERs and ERUs through [[Emissions Trading]].  While local emissions reduction schemes have no status under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] itself, they play a prominent role in creating the demand for CERs and ERUs, stimulating [[Emissions Trading]] and setting a [[market price]] for emissions.\n\nA well-known mandatory local emissions trading scheme is the [[EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS).\n\nNew changes are being made to the trading schemes. The [[EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] is set to make some new changes within the next year. The new changes will target the emissions produced by flight travel in and out of the European Union.<ref name=\"Callick, Rowan 2011\">Callick, Rowan. \"Nations Split on Route to Reduce Carbon Emissions.\" The Australian. 2 March 2011. Web. 1 March 2011.</ref>\n\nOther nations are scheduled to start participating in Emissions Trading Schemes within the next few years. These nations include China, India and the United States.<ref name=\"Callick, Rowan 2011\" />\n\n=== Voluntary market mechanisms ===\nIn contrast to the strict rules set out for the mandatory market, the voluntary market provides companies with different options to acquire emissions reductions. A solution, comparable with those developed for the mandatory market, has been developed for the voluntary market, the Verified Emission Reductions (VER). This measure has the great advantage that the projects/activities are managed according to the quality standards set out for CDM/JI projects but the certificates provided are not registered by the governments of the host countries or the Executive Board of the UNO. As such, high quality VERs can be acquired at lower costs for the same project quality. However, at present VERs can not be used in mandatory market.\n\nThe voluntary market in North America is divided between members of the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Over The Counter (OTC) market. The [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] is a voluntary yet legally binding [[emissions trading|cap-and-trade emission scheme]] whereby members commit to the capped emission reductions and must purchase allowances from other members or offset excess emissions. The OTC market does not involve a legally binding scheme and a wide array of buyers from the public and private spheres, as well as special events that want to go [[carbon neutral]]. Being carbon neutral refers to achieving net zero carbon emissions by balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset, or buying enough carbon credits to make up the difference.\n\nThere are project developers, wholesalers, brokers, and retailers, as well as carbon funds, in the voluntary market. Some businesses and nonprofits in the voluntary market encompass more than just one of the activities listed above. A report by Ecosystem Marketplace shows that carbon offset prices increase as it moves along the supply chain\u2014from project developer to retailer.<ref name=\"ecosysmarket\">{{cite web|url=http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/documents/acrobat/StateoftheVoluntaryCarbonMarket18July_Final.pdf|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710170031/http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/documents/acrobat/StateoftheVoluntaryCarbonMarket18July_Final.pdf|archivedate=10 July 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=21 August 2007|df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nWhile some mandatory emission reduction schemes exclude forest projects, these projects flourish in the voluntary markets. A major criticism concerns the imprecise nature of GHG sequestration quantification methodologies for forestry projects. However, others note the community co-benefits that [[forestry]] projects foster.\nProject types in the voluntary market range from avoided [[deforestation]], afforestation/reforestation, industrial gas [[Carbon dioxide sink|sequestration]], increased [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], fuel switching, [[Carbon capture and storage|methane capture]] from coal plants and [[Climate change and agriculture#Livestock|livestock]], and even [[renewable energy]].
