Meanwhile, Mei and Yamato go on a date where Nagi also comes after convincing her older brother Daichi to take her there, since she says she wanted to see Mei very much. After going on a few rides, Yamato realizes that Mei is scared but she is trying to be strong and fight those fears. At night, Nagi falls asleep and Yamato brings the two to a hotel.\n| LineColor           = DEB887\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 12\n| Title               = I'll Protect You\n| TranslitTitle       = Mamotteru yo\n| NativeTitle         = \u5b88\u3063\u3066\u308b\u3088\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|12|22}}\n| Aux4                = <ref name=\"Story\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Upon arriving at the station, Yamato leaves Nagi in Mei's care and hurries to Megumi's apartment. At the apartment, he meets Momo, Megumi's best friend. Megumi shut herself in her apartment because of the same reason that Mei and Nagi shunned making friends before, and won't come out even if it is Yamato knocking at her door. Seasons pass by, and things become stable for everyone, especially Yamato and Mei. Mei has already gotten out with Yamato and her friends during the summer festival, but on the insistence of her mother, she asks Yamato to watch the fireworks with her. Even if Mei arrives late and the fireworks over, it did not matter to Yamato, as he kissed her at the now-empty shrine.\n| LineColor           = DEB887\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 13\n| Title               = Say{{#tag:ref|This episode is called simply \"Say\" by ''Sentai Filmworks''.

However, on the way to Yamato's house the next day, Mei calls Yamato only to hear Nagi's voice, telling her that he does not want to see her today.  In reality Nagi wants to pamper Yamato and have him all to herself. After seeing Kai at the bakery, he and Mei later cross paths at their usual meeting spot, as they apologize to each other and spend the rest of the day together afterwards. At the end of the closing credits, Mei is heard saying I love you, conveniently ending the series by fulfilling the title...\n| LineColor           = DEB887\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = OAD\n| Title               = Someone\n| TranslitTitle       = Dareka ga\n| NativeTitle         = \u8ab0\u304b\u304c\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2013|7|24}}\n| Aux4                = <ref name=\"OAD\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-12-25/say-i-love-you-my-little-monster-manga-to-bundle-unaired-anime|title=Say, \"I Love You\"., My Little Monster Manga to Bundle Unaired Anime|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 21, 2013|accessdate=April 10, 2014}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary        = Mei, Aiko, Asami, and Nagi are making cookies at Mei's house. Knowing that the process could take a while, Nagi chases Yamato out of the house. He receives a text from Kai, who asks him if he wants to meet up at the park. When Yamato arrives, it is revealed that the rundown park was where the two of them first talked and bonded for the first time. After bantering a bit, Kai asks Yamato why he, who had always seemed to be having fun with a large crowd around him, was always the first one at the park after school. They start talking, and Kai tells her that he thinks she's cool for staying true to herself while modelling. Megumi snaps back at him, and the offended Kai leaves. At Mei's house, the cookies are done and turn out to be delicious. Yamato hugs Mei and tells her he's glad she's with him.
