She is an asari, a [[non-binary gender]]ed sapient [[homeothermy|homeotherm]] species with a [[pansexuality|pansexual]]-[[romantic orientation|panromantic]] orientation and are naturally inclined towards biotics<ref name=\"Alien races\"/>, the ability to \"manipulate dark energy and create mass effect fields through the use of electrical impulses from the brain\", allowing for telekinesis and other abilities.<ref name=\"Biotics\"/> Liara is noted for being the galactic community's foremost expert in the field of Prothean archaeology and technology, specifically evidence concerning the demise of the ancient Protheans, believed by the galactic community to be the pre-eminent civilization in the Milky Way galaxy until their sudden disappearance fifty thousands years before the events of the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy.\n\nLiara is voiced by [[Ali Hillis]] in the video games. Outside of the trilogy, Liara appears as the protagonist in the ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]'' series, and the fourth issue of ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', a comic series with individual issues on each of several ''Mass Effect 3'' squad mates prior to the Reaper invasion. Liara also has cameo appearances in ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]'', and in the animated feature film, ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]'', where she is voiced by [[Jamie Marchi]].\n\nLiara has been received positively, with placements on several \"top character\" critic and fan lists, and is one of the more popular characters in the series, particularly for fan art and [[cosplay]] activities.<ref name=\"Cosplay\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/check-out-this-great-liara-mass-effect-cosplay/|title=Check out this great Liara Mass Effect cosplay|author=Jody Macgregor|date=September 2, 2018 |publisher=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref> She was the subject of some controversy in 2007 following the release of the original ''Mass Effect'', after certain media outlets reported allegations of obscenity in the sex scenes between Shepard and their squad mates, and at least one case of government scrutiny over Liara's intimate scene with a female Shepard. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' squadmates, has been released.\n\n==Character overview==\n{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"I think, especially in Mass Effect 1 before she started to evolve, that almost everything was a discovery but especially in her relationships. She was always the scientist and always absorbing and even though she was deeply emotional she was observant and very reactionary in the way she went about things.

Most asari choose to use [[She (pronoun)|feminine third-person, singular personal pronouns]] as an efficient means of conversing with non-asari on terms they could understand.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> However, Liara has on at least one occasion responded to perceived [[gender bias]] and denied that she is a \"woman\", noting that her species has \"one\" gender and that the concept of [[gender binary|gender binarism]] is meaningless to the asari.<ref name=\"Gender\"/>\n\nThe asari are capable of procreating with any sentient life form, and can reproduce with any known sex, gender or species&mdash;their offspring are always asari, regardless of the species of their \"father\", which has led to in-universe claims of asari promiscuity.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> Instead of trading cellular material directly like other biological organisms, asari reproduce by \"melding\": linking their nervous systems with their partner's using their biotic abilities and utilizing the electrical pattern of their partners nerve's to provide a template for half the DNA of their resulting child. <ref name=\"polygon lore\"/> Liara is the offspring of Matriarch Aethyta and Matriarch Benezia, and is \"one-quarter krogan\" on Aethyta's side. Matriarch Aethyta is first encountered in ''Mass Effect 2'' as a bartender in Illium, where Lara was based as an information broker. She later moves on to tend a bar at the Presidium in ''Mass Effect 3'', where she is revealed as Liara's other biological parent and had been spying on her all along. As a \"pureblood\", a term often used as a cruel insult for children born of two asari, Liara grew up being [[Social exclusion|socially stigmatized]] by asari society. If Shepard discusses her parentage in the original ''Mass Effect'', Liara would speculate that her parents were possibly embarrassed by the union as the asari believe that for them to improve themselves, they should mate with other species to gain new genetic properties.\n\nAsari can live for over a thousand years<ref name=\"Polygon\"/>, and go through three stages of life: the Maiden stage, where they explore the world out of curiosity and restlessness, with many trying their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time; the Matron stage, where they begin to feel the desire to settle down to raise children; and finally the Matriarch stage, where they are often elevated as leaders of their communities, dispensing wisdom from centuries of life experience.<ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> Their long lifespan makes them more comfortable with observation.<ref name=\"Alien races\"/> Liara is 106 years old during her first appearance, which is the equivalent to a human teenager and within the Maiden stage of asari life. While she is legally [[age of majority]] under Citadel law, she is not considered to have reached [[adult]]hood by asari standards. In spite of her culturally young age, she is depicted in the series as possessing the skills and experience of a [[computer scientist]], [[xenoarchaeology|xenoarchaeologist]], [[philology|philologist]], and [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]].<ref name=\"RollingStones\"/>\n\nHillis liked Liara's selflessness in the first game, commenting in a 2014 interview, \"She is so pure. There\u2019s not a mean bone in her body. I like that about her. She\u2019s very analytical. She doesn\u2019t seem to be out for herself in any way.\"<ref name=\"Interview2\"/> Liara is a possible romantic interest for a male and female [[Commander Shepard]] throughout the entire ''Mass Effect'' trilogy.<ref name=\"Gamesradar\"/> \n\n==Creation and development==\n[[File:Jillian Murray 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jillian Murray]] was the face and body model for Liara.]]\nThe asari are a race of \"beautiful, blue aliens\" designed to add a familiar science-fiction element to the series.<ref name=\"Art\"/> \nDue to budget concerns, BioWare realized they would be unable to make both male and female versions for each of the races, which led to the creation of an all-female one.<ref name=\"Final Hours\">''The Final Hours of Mass Effect 3''.</ref> More alien-looking designs for the asari were made, but disregarded for their lack of human attractiveness.

Liara pleads with Shepard for help when they encounter her in Therum, offering to explain her circumstances and means to be freed. If Shepard pursues other leads first and significantly delays rescuing Liara, she mistakes her rescuers for figments of her own imagination as a result of being stuck for so long. Nevertheless, she humors her \"hallucinations\" and answers their questions. She only realizes Shepard's squad are real when they reappear to release her.\n\nOn her first debriefing aboard the Normandy, Liara shares her theory of cyclical extinction: the Protheans were just the latest in a long line of civilizations to reach a violent end after reaching their apex. Liara notes that there is remarkably little evidence of the Protheans' existence, and speculates that their final fate has been deliberately covered up. As Shepard obtains fragmented visions from various sources during the hunt for Saren and his agents, Liara offers her melding abilities to try and make sense of the data. She constantly exhausts herself after each encounter, prompting frequent suggestions to report to Dr. Chakwas, but collects herself together long enough to explain what she saw. Once Shepard obtains the Cipher, the Mu Relay's location, and the distress call from the Prothean Beacon on Virmire, Liara finally recognizes enough clues to deduce the lost planet of Ilos as the Conduit's true location.\n\n====''Mass Effect 2''====\n{{main|Mass Effect 2}}\nLiara's role in the original trilogy is reduced in ''Mass Effect 2'', set two years after the first game. Liara has become an information broker on Illium in direct rivalry to the Shadow Broker. She initially depicts a radically changed personality due to her experience working as a black market information dealer in the two years since ''Mass Effect''; having improved her biotic abilities, she also uses threats and other intimidation tactics to extort information, mimicking Benezia's demeanour and speech tactics when confronting others. If the player imported a Shepard from the original ''Mass Effect'' that romanced Liara, she greets Shepard with a kiss. Liara's anger at the Broker stems from when he recovered Shepard's body and was prepared to sell it to the Collectors during the events of ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]''. After certain dialogue choices, the player is finally able to break through her shell and reveal the real Liara, revealing that her seemingly darker personality is nothing more than a facade. Liara took pains in getting Shepard's body from the Broker and gave it to Cerberus so they could bring Shepard back to life. Liara knew that Cerberus would use Shepard for their own uses, but still gave them Shepard's body as she cares for Shepard and could not let the Commander go. She feared that Shepard would hate her for this, and apologizes. In spite of wanting to join Shepard, she declines Shepard's offer to join the suicide mission to rescue human colonists, in order to continue her quest for revenge against the Shadow Broker. \n\nLiara joins Shepard's crew temporarily in the ''Mass Effect 2'' DLC ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' if the player decides to help her hunt down the Shadow Broker. Shepard gradually breaks her hardened shell after lecturing her about mindlessly running into battles, but at the same time she states that she won't stop \"to enjoy the scenery\" until she's done. After the Shadow Broker is killed, Liara takes the opportunity to usurp his now vacant role. She says she will use her position and resources to help assist Shepard's ongoing mission to fight the Reapers. It is also possible to resume the player character's romance with Liara at the end of \"Lair of the Shadow Broker\".\n\n====Mass Effect 3====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect 3}}\nLiara returns  in ''Mass Effect 3'' as a mainstay of Shepard's squad. Liara becomes the Shadow Broker regardless of whether the player imports a ''Mass Effect 2'' [[saved game]]  where ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' was completed; if not, she tells Shepard that she took on the Shadow Broker with dozens of hired mercenaries, but it resulted in Feron's death. If Shepard assisted her in taking out the Shadow Broker, she mentions that during the time that Shepard was in Alliance custody, Cerberus managed to track down the Shadow Broker's ship. Liara and Feron loaded as much equipment as they could onto a shuttle as possible, then remotely sent the aging ship crashing into a pursuing Cerberus cruiser, resulting in the destruction of both ships. Liara notes that she has retained the crucial part of the Broker's operation, the galaxy-wide spy network.\n\nAfter the events of ''Arrival'', Admiral Hackett commissioned for Liara's aid, and they both realized what little time the galaxy had left before the Reapers arrived. However, this brought her into direct conflict with the Illusive Man and Cerberus. Eventually, through a process of elimination, mixed with desperation, she discovered plans for a \"Prothean superweapon\" on Mars. However, by then the Reaper invasion has reached Earth. Liara's familiarity with Prothean artifacts as well as asari culture and history, along with the significant resources at her disposal as the Shadow Broker, means that she plays a pivotal role in ''Mass Effect 3's'' narrative and often provides additional dialogue for plot exposition purposes if she is included in the party during certain missions.<ref name=\"Companion\"/> During the war, Liara recorded a collection of intel on the Reapers and her current cycle, as well as the complete history of the species of Liara's time and their accumulated knowledge of how to fight them.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/> She stores the information within Glyph, her [[Virtual intelligence|VI]] drone assistant, and stashes it away as a time capsule.<ref name=\"Lesson\"/> The time capsule represents a contingency plan if the allied races of her time are not able to defeat the Reapers in this cycle and are wiped out, ensuring the next cycle will have a better opportunity to prepare for the Reapers' arrival, and a complete set of plans to start out from.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/>\n\nIf the ''From Ashes'' DLC is installed and the Prothean [[endling]] Javik is recruited as a squad member, she is initially overjoyed to have one serving aboard the Normandy, but slowly becomes disillusioned; she admitted that she had previously imagined the Protheans as the \"keepers of wisdom and enlightenment\" of their era, only to find them to be \"cold and ruthless warlords\". Eventually, her relationship with Javik reaches a breaking point after the fall of Thessia; Liara confronts Javik at him quarters and vents her frustration at him for \"not having the answers\". If Shepard intervenes to defuse the situation instead of allowing Liara to walk away, the two will begin to respect and appreciate each other.\n\nDuring the main narrative of the downloadable add-on ''[[Mass Effect 3: Citadel|Citadel]]'', Liara calls in a favor to find information on the gun found by Shepard after they are attacked by an unknown mercenary group during the crew's shore leave. She will later participate in the raid on the Citadel Archives with the rest of Shepard's crew to pursue the instigators behind the group's attack. The DLC also adds a number of character moments for the character, such as Liara playing the only song she knew how to on the piano located on the lower floor of Shepard's apartment, and her friendly rivalry with James Vega through debates and card games during the big party, culminating in Liara demonstrating her levitation powers on Vega while intoxicated.\n\n====Mass Effect: Andromeda====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect: Andromeda}}\nLiara T'Soni makes a cameo appearance in ''Andromeda'', in the form of voice messages sent to Alex Ryder in his quarters aboard the Hyperion. Pathfinder Ryder can unlock and listen to Liara's voice messages, which were originally sent in 2182, a year before her encounter with Shepard, where she discussed her research into the Protheans and their lost empire. Eventually, Ryder will unlock a message by Liara from 2186, sent to Alec while he was in stasis on the Hyperion traveling to Andromeda, informing him that the Reapers have arrived. She mentions the Crucible but warns Alec to expect the worst, and asks him and his children to not forget the people they left behind.\n\n===In other media===\n====''Mass Effect: Redemption''====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect: Redemption}}\nThe narrative in ''Redemption'' begins with Commander Shepard mysteriously disappearing in the Terminus Systems, out of contact with the SSV ''Normandy'' and its crew. Both the Shadow Broker and Liara T'Soni are to find and retrieve the dead body of Commander Shepard. Just as Tazzik, an agent of the Shadow Broker wants to turn over the corpse to the Collectors, Liara manages to capture it, with the help of the drell Feron, who is captured in the process, and turn it over to Cerberus, hoping that they may be able to revive Shepard.\n\n====''Mass Effect: Paragon Lost''====\nLiara appears as a minor character in the animated feature film ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]''. This marks the only instance where Ali Hillis did not reprise her role as the character.\n\n====''Mass Effect: Homeworlds''====\nLiara is the protagonist of the fourth issue of ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', which takes place after the ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' DLC. As the new Shadow Broker, Liara desperately searches for a way to stop the [[Reaper]]s. Journeying to [[Thessia]] to examine the Prothean archives there, she is disappointed to learn how little they contain. A former colleague recommends investigating Kahje since its Prothean ruins are much more vast. Once there, Liara persuades a hanar official to allow her to visit a submerged Prothean site that had become a hanar shrine. A [[drell]] named Quoyle takes her to the shrine, but on arrival the shrine launches torpedoes at Quoyle's craft; a Cerberus [[Mass Effect 3|Phantom]] had killed the shrine's staff and activated the defenses. When the craft is hit, Liara uses her biotics to keep it from flooding while Quoyle guides it to the dock.\n\nAt the shrine, Liara encounters and kills the Phantom, using her biotics to slam a piece of debris through the Phantom's skull. Quoyle is wounded, but not mortally and tells Liara to go on to the archives. There, Liara discovers a promising lead in the form of encryption keys for other Prothean archives, but is interrupted by the Illusive Man. He insists that the Phantom is not his doing, blaming the attack on a rogue faction within Cerberus and proposes that they form an alliance against the Reapers. Liara agrees that to pool her resources with Cerberus's against the Reapers might be a mutually beneficial move, but she insists that he upload his information first. When the Illusive Man remains silent, Liara opines that either he wants to keep the information he has to himself, or that he doesn't have any information in the first place.\n\nAs Liara goes to leave, the Illusive Man insinuates that she doesn't have what it takes to be the Shadow Broker, claiming that his black market contacts think the Broker has become soft, weak and vulnerable to usurpation, insisting she needs his help; Liara retorts that he is the one trying to make a deal, advises him to send an army the next time he tries to kill her and leaves. As she helps Quoyle to the shrine's shuttle bay, she informs Admiral Hackett of her possible lead and asks for access to a top-secret facility on [[Mars]].\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"Liara is conflicted.

Outside of the trilogy, Liara appears as the protagonist in the ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]'' series, and the fourth issue of ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', a comic series with individual issues on each of several ''Mass Effect 3'' squad mates prior to the Reaper invasion. Liara also has cameo appearances in ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]'', and in the animated feature film, ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]'', where she is voiced by [[Jamie Marchi]].\n\nLiara has been received positively, with placements on several \"top character\" critic and fan lists, and is one of the more popular characters in the series, particularly for fan art and [[cosplay]] activities.<ref name=\"Cosplay\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/check-out-this-great-liara-mass-effect-cosplay/|title=Check out this great Liara Mass Effect cosplay|author=Jody Macgregor|date=September 2, 2018 |publisher=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref> She was the subject of some controversy in 2007 following the release of the original ''Mass Effect'', after certain media outlets reported allegations of obscenity in the sex scenes between Shepard and their squad mates, and at least one case of government scrutiny over Liara's intimate scene with a female Shepard.

Most asari choose to use [[She (pronoun)|feminine third-person, singular personal pronouns]] as an efficient means of conversing with non-asari on terms they could understand.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> However, Liara has on at least one occasion responded to perceived [[gender bias]] and denied that she is a \"woman\", noting that her species has \"one\" gender and that the concept of [[gender binary|gender binarism]] is meaningless to the asari.<ref name=\"Gender\"/>\n\nThe asari are capable of procreating with any sentient life form, and can reproduce with any known sex, gender or species&mdash;their offspring are always asari, regardless of the species of their \"father\", which has led to in-universe claims of asari promiscuity.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> Instead of trading cellular material directly like other biological organisms, asari reproduce by \"melding\": linking their nervous systems with their partner's using their biotic abilities and utilizing the electrical pattern of their partners nerve's to provide a template for half the DNA of their resulting child. <ref name=\"polygon lore\"/> Liara is the offspring of Matriarch Aethyta and Matriarch Benezia, and is \"one-quarter krogan\" on Aethyta's side. Matriarch Aethyta is first encountered in ''Mass Effect 2'' as a bartender in Illium, where Lara was based as an information broker. She later moves on to tend a bar at the Presidium in ''Mass Effect 3'', where she is revealed as Liara's other biological parent and had been spying on her all along. As a \"pureblood\", a term often used as a cruel insult for children born of two asari, Liara grew up being [[Social exclusion|socially stigmatized]] by asari society. If Shepard discusses her parentage in the original ''Mass Effect'', Liara would speculate that her parents were possibly embarrassed by the union as the asari believe that for them to improve themselves, they should mate with other species to gain new genetic properties.\n\nAsari can live for over a thousand years<ref name=\"Polygon\"/>, and go through three stages of life: the Maiden stage, where they explore the world out of curiosity and restlessness, with many trying their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time; the Matron stage, where they begin to feel the desire to settle down to raise children; and finally the Matriarch stage, where they are often elevated as leaders of their communities, dispensing wisdom from centuries of life experience.<ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> Their long lifespan makes them more comfortable with observation.<ref name=\"Alien races\"/> Liara is 106 years old during her first appearance, which is the equivalent to a human teenager and within the Maiden stage of asari life. While she is legally [[age of majority]] under Citadel law, she is not considered to have reached [[adult]]hood by asari standards. In spite of her culturally young age, she is depicted in the series as possessing the skills and experience of a [[computer scientist]], [[xenoarchaeology|xenoarchaeologist]], [[philology|philologist]], and [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]].<ref name=\"RollingStones\"/>\n\nHillis liked Liara's selflessness in the first game, commenting in a 2014 interview, \"She is so pure.

Liara pleads with Shepard for help when they encounter her in Therum, offering to explain her circumstances and means to be freed. If Shepard pursues other leads first and significantly delays rescuing Liara, she mistakes her rescuers for figments of her own imagination as a result of being stuck for so long. Nevertheless, she humors her \"hallucinations\" and answers their questions. She only realizes Shepard's squad are real when they reappear to release her.\n\nOn her first debriefing aboard the Normandy, Liara shares her theory of cyclical extinction: the Protheans were just the latest in a long line of civilizations to reach a violent end after reaching their apex. Liara notes that there is remarkably little evidence of the Protheans' existence, and speculates that their final fate has been deliberately covered up. As Shepard obtains fragmented visions from various sources during the hunt for Saren and his agents, Liara offers her melding abilities to try and make sense of the data. She constantly exhausts herself after each encounter, prompting frequent suggestions to report to Dr. Chakwas, but collects herself together long enough to explain what she saw. Once Shepard obtains the Cipher, the Mu Relay's location, and the distress call from the Prothean Beacon on Virmire, Liara finally recognizes enough clues to deduce the lost planet of Ilos as the Conduit's true location.\n\n====''Mass Effect 2''====\n{{main|Mass Effect 2}}\nLiara's role in the original trilogy is reduced in ''Mass Effect 2'', set two years after the first game. Liara has become an information broker on Illium in direct rivalry to the Shadow Broker. She initially depicts a radically changed personality due to her experience working as a black market information dealer in the two years since ''Mass Effect''; having improved her biotic abilities, she also uses threats and other intimidation tactics to extort information, mimicking Benezia's demeanour and speech tactics when confronting others. If the player imported a Shepard from the original ''Mass Effect'' that romanced Liara, she greets Shepard with a kiss. Liara's anger at the Broker stems from when he recovered Shepard's body and was prepared to sell it to the Collectors during the events of ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]''. After certain dialogue choices, the player is finally able to break through her shell and reveal the real Liara, revealing that her seemingly darker personality is nothing more than a facade. Liara took pains in getting Shepard's body from the Broker and gave it to Cerberus so they could bring Shepard back to life. Liara knew that Cerberus would use Shepard for their own uses, but still gave them Shepard's body as she cares for Shepard and could not let the Commander go. She feared that Shepard would hate her for this, and apologizes. In spite of wanting to join Shepard, she declines Shepard's offer to join the suicide mission to rescue human colonists, in order to continue her quest for revenge against the Shadow Broker. \n\nLiara joins Shepard's crew temporarily in the ''Mass Effect 2'' DLC ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' if the player decides to help her hunt down the Shadow Broker. Shepard gradually breaks her hardened shell after lecturing her about mindlessly running into battles, but at the same time she states that she won't stop \"to enjoy the scenery\" until she's done. After the Shadow Broker is killed, Liara takes the opportunity to usurp his now vacant role. She says she will use her position and resources to help assist Shepard's ongoing mission to fight the Reapers. It is also possible to resume the player character's romance with Liara at the end of \"Lair of the Shadow Broker\".\n\n====Mass Effect 3====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect 3}}\nLiara returns  in ''Mass Effect 3'' as a mainstay of Shepard's squad. Liara becomes the Shadow Broker regardless of whether the player imports a ''Mass Effect 2'' [[saved game]]  where ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' was completed; if not, she tells Shepard that she took on the Shadow Broker with dozens of hired mercenaries, but it resulted in Feron's death. If Shepard assisted her in taking out the Shadow Broker, she mentions that during the time that Shepard was in Alliance custody, Cerberus managed to track down the Shadow Broker's ship. Liara and Feron loaded as much equipment as they could onto a shuttle as possible, then remotely sent the aging ship crashing into a pursuing Cerberus cruiser, resulting in the destruction of both ships. Liara notes that she has retained the crucial part of the Broker's operation, the galaxy-wide spy network.\n\nAfter the events of ''Arrival'', Admiral Hackett commissioned for Liara's aid, and they both realized what little time the galaxy had left before the Reapers arrived. However, this brought her into direct conflict with the Illusive Man and Cerberus. Eventually, through a process of elimination, mixed with desperation, she discovered plans for a \"Prothean superweapon\" on Mars. However, by then the Reaper invasion has reached Earth. Liara's familiarity with Prothean artifacts as well as asari culture and history, along with the significant resources at her disposal as the Shadow Broker, means that she plays a pivotal role in ''Mass Effect 3's'' narrative and often provides additional dialogue for plot exposition purposes if she is included in the party during certain missions.<ref name=\"Companion\"/> During the war, Liara recorded a collection of intel on the Reapers and her current cycle, as well as the complete history of the species of Liara's time and their accumulated knowledge of how to fight them.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/> She stores the information within Glyph, her [[Virtual intelligence|VI]] drone assistant, and stashes it away as a time capsule.<ref name=\"Lesson\"/> The time capsule represents a contingency plan if the allied races of her time are not able to defeat the Reapers in this cycle and are wiped out, ensuring the next cycle will have a better opportunity to prepare for the Reapers' arrival, and a complete set of plans to start out from.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/>\n\nIf the ''From Ashes'' DLC is installed and the Prothean [[endling]] Javik is recruited as a squad member, she is initially overjoyed to have one serving aboard the Normandy, but slowly becomes disillusioned; she admitted that she had previously imagined the Protheans as the \"keepers of wisdom and enlightenment\" of their era, only to find them to be \"cold and ruthless warlords\". Eventually, her relationship with Javik reaches a breaking point after the fall of Thessia; Liara confronts Javik at him quarters and vents her frustration at him for \"not having the answers\". If Shepard intervenes to defuse the situation instead of allowing Liara to walk away, the two will begin to respect and appreciate each other.\n\nDuring the main narrative of the downloadable add-on ''[[Mass Effect 3: Citadel|Citadel]]'', Liara calls in a favor to find information on the gun found by Shepard after they are attacked by an unknown mercenary group during the crew's shore leave. She will later participate in the raid on the Citadel Archives with the rest of Shepard's crew to pursue the instigators behind the group's attack. The DLC also adds a number of character moments for the character, such as Liara playing the only song she knew how to on the piano located on the lower floor of Shepard's apartment, and her friendly rivalry with James Vega through debates and card games during the big party, culminating in Liara demonstrating her levitation powers on Vega while intoxicated.\n\n====Mass Effect: Andromeda====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect: Andromeda}}\nLiara T'Soni makes a cameo appearance in ''Andromeda'', in the form of voice messages sent to Alex Ryder in his quarters aboard the Hyperion. Pathfinder Ryder can unlock and listen to Liara's voice messages, which were originally sent in 2182, a year before her encounter with Shepard, where she discussed her research into the Protheans and their lost empire. Eventually, Ryder will unlock a message by Liara from 2186, sent to Alec while he was in stasis on the Hyperion traveling to Andromeda, informing him that the Reapers have arrived. She mentions the Crucible but warns Alec to expect the worst, and asks him and his children to not forget the people they left behind.\n\n===In other media===\n====''Mass Effect: Redemption''====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect: Redemption}}\nThe narrative in ''Redemption'' begins with Commander Shepard mysteriously disappearing in the Terminus Systems, out of contact with the SSV ''Normandy'' and its crew. Both the Shadow Broker and Liara T'Soni are to find and retrieve the dead body of Commander Shepard. Just as Tazzik, an agent of the Shadow Broker wants to turn over the corpse to the Collectors, Liara manages to capture it, with the help of the drell Feron, who is captured in the process, and turn it over to Cerberus, hoping that they may be able to revive Shepard.\n\n====''Mass Effect: Paragon Lost''====\nLiara appears as a minor character in the animated feature film ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]''. This marks the only instance where Ali Hillis did not reprise her role as the character.\n\n====''Mass Effect: Homeworlds''====\nLiara is the protagonist of the fourth issue of ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', which takes place after the ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' DLC. As the new Shadow Broker, Liara desperately searches for a way to stop the [[Reaper]]s. Journeying to [[Thessia]] to examine the Prothean archives there, she is disappointed to learn how little they contain. A former colleague recommends investigating Kahje since its Prothean ruins are much more vast. Once there, Liara persuades a hanar official to allow her to visit a submerged Prothean site that had become a hanar shrine. A [[drell]] named Quoyle takes her to the shrine, but on arrival the shrine launches torpedoes at Quoyle's craft; a Cerberus [[Mass Effect 3|Phantom]] had killed the shrine's staff and activated the defenses. When the craft is hit, Liara uses her biotics to keep it from flooding while Quoyle guides it to the dock.\n\nAt the shrine, Liara encounters and kills the Phantom, using her biotics to slam a piece of debris through the Phantom's skull. Quoyle is wounded, but not mortally and tells Liara to go on to the archives. There, Liara discovers a promising lead in the form of encryption keys for other Prothean archives, but is interrupted by the Illusive Man. He insists that the Phantom is not his doing, blaming the attack on a rogue faction within Cerberus and proposes that they form an alliance against the Reapers. Liara agrees that to pool her resources with Cerberus's against the Reapers might be a mutually beneficial move, but she insists that he upload his information first. When the Illusive Man remains silent, Liara opines that either he wants to keep the information he has to himself, or that he doesn't have any information in the first place.\n\nAs Liara goes to leave, the Illusive Man insinuates that she doesn't have what it takes to be the Shadow Broker, claiming that his black market contacts think the Broker has become soft, weak and vulnerable to usurpation, insisting she needs his help; Liara retorts that he is the one trying to make a deal, advises him to send an army the next time he tries to kill her and leaves. As she helps Quoyle to the shrine's shuttle bay, she informs Admiral Hackett of her possible lead and asks for access to a top-secret facility on [[Mars]].\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"Liara is conflicted.
