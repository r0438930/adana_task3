Diagenetic [[Siderite]] intercalations and concretions, ~20 cm thick, as well as [[Pyrite]] concretions are also present.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The mineralization \nof Siderite occurs in all types of Ciechocinek Formation deposits. Include fine crystalline variety, coarse crystalline rhombohedra and fine crystalline aggregates impregnated by mixture of un de termined Fehydroxides.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> The mineralization of the siedrites on certain layers is associated to the abundance of organic matter, with the deacay of it ending on a progressive carbonate supersaturation, with an early precipitation on the nucleous of the siderites. They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to thepure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are from rare o extremely rare. Mudstones are porrly consolidated, tren to disintegration, swell and become plastic, being the only exceptional ones those the heavy sideritic mudstones, that range froma wide variety of colors, from  brown or cherry-red in colour, with an olive shade often appearing.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> On the other hand, there are abundant poorly consolidated [[Quartz]] sandstones, that are regularly intercalated with [[Silt]] and [[Siltstone]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Along the Sandstones, there are [[Chlorite]] and [[Kaolinite]] grains. Plant microremains are common, concentrated with mica flakes on lamination planes, while larger wood fragments, several cm long, are also moderately frequent.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Heavy minerals are present and include as the most common [[Euhedral]] forms such as [[Zircon]], [[Rutile]] and [[Tourmaline]], along with angular fragments of [[Rutile]], [[Garnet]] and [[Staurolite]], with finally well-rounded oval grains of Zircon, Rutile, Garnet and Tourmaline. Outside the main heavy minerals, it is possible to find well-rounded grains of green [[Hornblende]], [[Apatite]], [[Disthene]], [[Epidote]], and finally on one study one [[Pyroxene]] grain was found.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The presence of [[Kaolinite]], related to continental formation in tropical climate environments for the chemical weathering of different igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, along with [[Chlorite]] & [[Biotite]], suggest a deposition linked to fluvial & deltaic forces. The eastern Sudetes and their foreland are the best candidates for be the origin of the transported material, as they have a nearly identical composition, being the Lower Jurassic deposits in the [[Fore-Sudetic Monocline]] linked [[Cracow-Cz\u00eastochowa Monocline]], with the strata of the Formation.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\n[[File:Wapienno - kamienio\u0142omy Cementowni Kujawy - Lafarge Cement 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, with exposed strata of the Formation.]]\nDeposits of the Ciechocinek Formation are related to a brackish-marine origin, being  deposited in an epicontinental sedimentary basin on Poland, that was the eastern arm of the Mid-European [[Toarcian]] Basin.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/>  The main component of the deposits are muds,  intercalate sandstones & silts disposed on a high variety of structures, with at least twelve lithofacies that run from fine-grained sedimentations to wave dominated [[Sandy Shoal]]s. It is believed that the dominat sedimentation was by quiet [[Mud]] and silt sedimentation from suspension, which probably come from near [[River Mouths]].  It was a sedimentary basin with a continuous influx of [[Clay]] and fine [[Silt]], to which sand was brought by events such as river transportation, storms, eustatic effects, and other related.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\">Leonowicz, P.
