He was the [[Romanian Communist Party#General Secretaries (1921\u20131989)|general secretary]] of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] from 1965 to 1989 and hence the second and last [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist leader]] of Romania. He was also the country's head of state from 1967, serving as President of the [[State Council of Romania|State Council]] and from 1974 concurrently as [[President of Romania|President of the Republic]] until his overthrow and execution in the [[Romanian Revolution]] in December 1989, part of a series of [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] and [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet Union]] uprisings in [[Eastern Europe]] that year.\n\nBorn in 1918 in [[Scornice\u0219ti]], [[Olt County]], Ceau\u0219escu was a member of the Romanian Communist youth movement. Ceau\u0219escu rose up through the ranks of [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]]'s Socialist government and, upon Gheorghiu-Dej's death in 1965, he succeeded to the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party as general secretary.<ref>Behr, E.

However, the resulting period of stability was very brief as his government very soon became severely [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] and was considered the most repressive in the [[Eastern Bloc]] at the time. His [[secret police]], the [[Securitate]], was responsible for [[mass surveillance]] as well as [[Securitate#Method|severe repression]] and human rights abuses within the country, and he suppressed and controlled the media and press, implementing methods that were among the harshest, most restrictive and brutal in the world. Economic mismanagement [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu#Oil embargo, strike and foreign relations|due to failed oil ventures during the 1970s]] led to skyrocketing foreign debts for Romania. In 1982, he exported much of the country's agricultural and industrial production in an effort to repay them. The shortages that followed drastically lowered living standards, leading to [[1980s austerity policy in Romania|heavy rationing of food, water, oil, heat, electricity, medicine and other necessities]]. [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu's cult of personality|His cult of personality]] experienced unprecedented elevation, followed by extensive [[nepotism]] and the intense deterioration of foreign relations, even with the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nAs anti-government protesters demonstrated in [[Timi\u0219oara]] in December 1989, he perceived the demonstrations as a political threat and ordered military forces to open fire on 17 December, causing many deaths and injuries.

In 1952, Gheorghiu-Dej brought him onto the [[Central Committee]] months after the party's \"Muscovite faction\" led by [[Ana Pauker]] had been purged. In the late 1940s-early 1950s, the Party had been divided into the \"home communists\" headed by Gheorghiu-Dej who remained inside Romania prior to 1944 and the \"Muscovites\" who had gone into exile in the Soviet Union. With the partial exception of Poland, where the [[Polish October]] crisis of 1956 brought to power the previously imprisoned \"home communist\" [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], Romania was the only Eastern European nation where the \"home communists\" triumphed over the \"Muscovites\". In the rest of the Soviet bloc, there were a series of purges in this period that led to the \"home communists\" being executed or imprisoned. Like his patron Gheorghiu-Dej, Ceau\u0219escu was a \"home communist\" who benefited from the fall of the \"Muscovites\" in 1952. In 1954, Ceau\u0219escu became a full member of the Politburo and eventually rose to occupy the second-highest position in the party hierarchy.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" />\n\n==Leadership of Romania==\nWhen Gheorghiu-Dej died on 19 March 1965, Ceau\u0219escu was not the obvious successor despite his closeness to the longtime leader. However, widespread infighting by older and more connected officials made the Politburo turn to Ceau\u0219escu as a compromise candidate.<ref name=\"Revolution1989\" /> He was elected general secretary on 22 March 1965, three days after Gheorghiu-Dej's death.\n\nOne of his first acts was to change the name of the party from the Romanian Workers' Party back to the [[Communist Party of Romania]] and to declare the country a [[socialist republic]], rather than a [[people's republic]]. In 1967, he consolidated his power by becoming president of the [[State Council of Romania|State Council]], making him ''de jure'' head of state. His political apparatus sent many thousands of political opponents to prison or psychiatric hospitals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thegenocideofthesouls.org/public/english/the-pitesti-experiment/ |title= 8) The premeditated extermination of political detainees (1945\u20131989) |accessdate=May 17, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ceausescu.jpg|thumb|left|Ceau\u0219escu with [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1965.]]\nInitially, Ceau\u0219escu became a popular figure, both in Romania and in the West, because of his independent foreign policy, which challenged the authority of the [[Soviet Union]]. In the 1960s, he eased press censorship and ended Romania's active participation in the Warsaw Pact, but Romania formally remained a member. He refused to take part in the [[Prague Spring|1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia]] by Warsaw Pact forces and even actively and openly condemned that action in his [[Ceau\u0219escu's speech of 21 August 1968|21 August 1968 speech]]. He travelled to [[Prague]] a week before the invasion to offer moral support to his Czechoslovak counterpart, [[Alexander Dub\u010dek]].

The [[De-Stalinization in Romania|liberalization of 1965]] was condemned and an index of banned books and authors was re-established.\n\nThe Theses heralded the beginning of a \"mini cultural revolution\" in Romania, launching a [[Neo-Stalinism|Neo-Stalinist]] offensive against cultural autonomy, reaffirming an ideological basis for literature that, in theory, the Party had hardly abandoned. Although presented in terms of \"Socialist Humanism\", the Theses in fact marked a return to the strict guidelines of [[Socialist realism in Romania|Socialist Realism]], and attacks on non-compliant intellectuals. Strict ideological conformity in the humanities and social sciences was demanded. Competence and aesthetics were to be replaced by ideology; professionals were to be replaced by [[Agitprop|agitators]]; and culture was once again to become an instrument for political-ideological propaganda and hardline measures. In a 1972 speech, Ceau\u0219escu stated he wanted \" a certain blending of party and state activities...in the long run we shall witness an ever closer blending of the activities of the party, state and other social bodies.\"<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 354\">Crampton, Richard ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century-And After'', London: Routledge, 1997 page 354.</ref> In practice, a number of joint party-state organizations were founded such as the Council for Socialist Education and Culture, which had no precise counterpart in any of the other communist states of Eastern Europe, and the Romanian Communist Party was embedded into the daily life of the nation in a way that it never had been before.<ref>Crampton, Richard ''Eastern Europe In the Twentieth Century-And After'', London: Routledge, 1997 pages 354\u2013355.</ref> In 1974, the party programme of the Romanian Communist Party announced that structural changes in society were insufficient to create a full socialist consciousness in the people, and that a full socialist consciousness could only come about if the entire population was made aware of socialist values that guided society.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 354\"/> The Communist Party was to be the agency that would so \"enlighten\" the population and in the words of the British historian Richard Crampton \"...the party would merge state and society, the individual and the collective, and would promote 'the ever more organic participation of party members in the entire social life'\".<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 354\"/>\n\n=== President of the Socialist Republic of Romania ===\n[[File:Flag of Chairman of Councils of State and of Ministers of Romania.svg|thumb|Standard as President of Romania]]\nIn 1974, Ceau\u0219escu converted his post of president of the State Council to a full-fledged [[President of Romania|executive presidency]]. He was first elected to this post [[1974 Romanian presidential election|in 1974]], and would be reelected every five years until 1989.\n\nAlthough Ceau\u0219escu had been nominal head of state since 1967, he had merely been first among equals on the State Council, deriving his real power coming from his status as party leader. The new post, however, made him the nation's top decision-maker both in name and in fact. He was empowered to carry out those functions of the State Council that did not require [[plenum (meeting)|plenums]]. He also appointed and dismissed the president of the Supreme Court and the prosecutor general whenever the legislature was not in session. In practice, from 1974 onward Ceau\u0219escu frequently ruled by decree.<ref>Grosescu, R. (2004). \"The Political Regrouping of Romanian Nomenklatura during the 1989 Revolution\". ''Romanian Journal of Society and Politics'', 4(1), 97\u2013123.</ref> Over time, he usurped many powers and functions that nominally were vested in the State Council as a whole.<ref name=cs>{{csref|country=romania|author=Sergiu Verona|section=Government and Politics}}</ref>\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Ceau\u0219escu now held all governing power in the nation; virtually all party and state institutions were subordinated to his will. The principles of democratic centralism, combined with the legislature's infrequent sessions (it sat in full session only twice a year) meant that for all intents and purposes, his decisions had the force of law.\n\n===Oil embargo, strike and foreign relations===\nStarting with the [[1973 oil crisis|1973\u201374 Arab oil embargo]] against the West, a period of prolonged high oil prices set in that characterised the rest of the 1970s. Romania as a major oil producer greatly benefited from the high oil prices of the 1970s, which led Ceau\u0219escu to embark on an ambitious plan to invest heavily in oil-refining plants.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 356\">Crampton, Richard ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century-And After'', London: Routledge, 1997 page 356.</ref> Ceau\u0219escu's plan was to make Romania into Europe's number one oil refiner not only of its oil, but also of oil from Middle Eastern states like Iraq and Iran, and then to sell all of the refined oil at a profit on the Rotterdam spot market.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 356\" /> As Romania lacked the money to build the necessary oil refining plants and Ceau\u0219escu chose to spend the windfall from the high oil prices on aid to the Third World in an attempt to buy Romania international influence, Ceau\u0219escu borrowed heavily from Western banks on the assumption that when the loans came due, the profits from the sales of the refined oil would be more than enough to pay off the loans.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 356\" /> A major problem with Ceau\u0219escu's oil-refining plan which led to Romania taking enormous loans was the low productivity of Romanian workers, which meant that the oil-refining plants were finished years behind schedule.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 356\" /> [[1977 Vrancea earthquake|The 1977 earthquake]] which destroyed much of Bucharest also led to delays in the oil plan.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 356\" /> By the time the oil refining plants were finished in the early 1980s, a slump in oil prices had set in, leading to major financial problems for Romania.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 356\" />\n\n[[File:Ceausescu and Carter 2.jpg|thumb|Ceau\u0219escu with [[Jimmy Carter]] during a visit in Washington, D.C. in 1978]]\nIn August 1977 over 30,000 miners went on strike in the [[Jiu River]] valley complaining of low pay and poor working conditions.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 355\" /> The [[Jiu Valley miners' strike of 1977|Jiu valley miners' strike]] was the most significant expression of opposition to Ceau\u0219escu's rule prior to the late 1980s. The striking miners were inspired by similar strikes along Poland's Baltic coast in December 1970, and just as in Poland in 1970, the striking Romanian miners demanded face-to-face negotiations with their nation's leader.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 355\" /> When Ceau\u0219escu appeared before the miners on the third day of the strike, he was greeted in the words of the British historian Richard Crampton \"... once again ''\u00e1 la polonaise'', with cries of 'Down with the Red Bourgeoisie!'\".<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 355\" /> Hearing reports that his soldiers were reluctant to fire on fellow Romanians led Ceau\u0219escu to negotiate a compromise solution to the strike.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 355\" /> In the years after the strike, the majority of its leaders died of cancer. After 1989, it was revealed that the ''Securitate'' had doctors give the strike leaders 5-minute chest X-rays to ensure the development of cancer.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 355\" />\n\nHe continued to follow an independent policy in foreign relations\u2014for example, in 1984, Romania was one of few communist states (notably including the People's Republic of China, and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) to take part in the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles, despite a Soviet-led boycott.\n\n[[File:Mugabe76Romania.jpg|thumb|Ceau\u0219escu in a meeting with [[Robert Mugabe]] in 1979]]\nAlso, the Socialist Republic of Romania was the first of the [[Eastern bloc]] nations to have official relations with the [[Western bloc]] and the [[European Community]]: an agreement including Romania in the Community's Generalised System of Preferences was signed in 1974 and an Agreement on Industrial Products was signed in 1980. On 4 April 1975, Ceau\u0219escu visited Japan and met with [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]].\n\nIn June 1978, Ceau\u0219escu made a state visit to the UK where a \u00a3200m licensing agreement was signed between the Romanian government and [[British Aerospace]] for the production of more than eighty [[BAC One-Eleven]] aircraft. The deal was said at the time to be the biggest between two countries involving a civil aircraft.<ref>{{cite news|title=Britain and Romania sign \u00a3200m plane deal|last=Spainer|first=David|date=16 June 1978|work=The Times|page=1|location=London}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1978, Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Michael O'Kennedy]] met Romanian leader Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu when he stopped off at the [[Shannon Airport]] on his way to visit [[Jimmy Carter]] in the United States. This kind of activity was an aspect of O'Kennedy's duties as international leaders often stopped at the airport on their way to the US. Ceau\u0219escu told journalists \"that there was a great similarity between the Romanian and Irish people in that they were hard working, diligent and endeavoured to maintain their independence and sovereignty.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/ceausescu-expected-fanfare-on-stopover-81021.html|title=Ceausescu expected fanfare on stopover|date=1 January 2009|website=www.irishexaminer.com|accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Pacepa defection===\nIn 1978, [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], a senior member of the Romanian political police ([[Securitate]], State Security), defected to the United States. A three-star general, he was the highest ranking defector from the [[Eastern Bloc]] during the [[Cold War]]. His defection was a powerful blow against the administration, forcing Ceau\u0219escu to overhaul the architecture of the Security. Pacepa's 1986 book, ''Red Horizons: Chronicles of a Communist Spy Chief'' ({{ISBN|0-89526-570-2}}), claims to expose details of Ceau\u0219escu's government activities, such as massive spying on American industry and elaborate efforts to rally Western political support.\n\n===Foreign debt===\n{{main|1980s austerity policy in Romania}}\n[[File:Personality Cult Romania 1986.jpg|thumb|left|By the 1980s, the Ceau\u0219escus had developed a [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu's cult of personality|personality cult]]. ]]\nCeau\u0219escu's political independence from the Soviet Union and his protest against the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]] drew the interest of Western powers, whose governments briefly believed that he was an anti-Soviet maverick and hoped to create a schism in the Warsaw Pact by funding him. Ceau\u0219escu did not realise that the funding was not always favorable. Ceau\u0219escu was able to borrow heavily (more than $13&nbsp;billion) from the West to finance economic development programs, but these loans ultimately devastated the country's finances.  He also secured a deal for cheap oil from [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]], but that deal fell through after the Shah was [[Iranian Revolution|overthrown]].\n\nIn an attempt to correct this, Ceau\u0219escu decided to repay Romania's [[foreign debt]]s. He organised a referendum and managed to change the constitution, adding a clause that barred Romania from taking foreign loans in the future. According to official results, the referendum yielded a nearly unanimous \"yes\" vote.<ref>Mungiu\u2010Pippidi, A. (2001). \"The Return of Populism\u2010The 2000 Romanian Elections\". ''[[Government and Opposition]]'', 36(2), 230\u2013252.</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, Ceau\u0219escu ordered the export of much of the country's agricultural and industrial production in order to repay its debts. The resulting domestic shortages made the everyday lives of Romanians a fight for survival as food rationing was introduced and heating, gas and electricity blackouts became the rule. During the 1980s, there was a steady decrease in the Romanian population's living standards, especially in the availability and quality of food and general goods in shops. During this time, all regional radio stations were closed, and television was limited to a single channel broadcasting for only two hours a day.\n\nThe debt was fully paid in the summer of 1989, shortly before Ceau\u0219escu was overthrown.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\n===1984 failed coup d'\u00e9tat attempt===\nA tentative [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] planned in October 1984 failed when the military unit assigned to carry out the plan was sent to harvest maize instead.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ceau\u015fescu and the Securitate: Coercion and Dissent in Romania, 1965\u20131989|first=Dennis|last=Deletant|page=351|isbn=978-1563246333|publisher=M.E.Sharpe|year=1995}}</ref>\n\n===Romani Rights===\nDuring the Ceau\u0219escu regime, the [[Romani people|Romani]] were largely neglected. This can be seen, perhaps most blatantly, with a motion from the [[Romanian Communist Party|Politburo of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers Party]], which largely laid the foundation for the Ceau\u0219escu regime's policies regarding the rights of ethnic minorities. The motion ignored the Romani entirely.<ref name=\"books.openedition.org\">{{Cite book|url=http://books.openedition.org/ceup/1554|title=The Roma in Romanian History|first=Viorel|last=Achim|date=23 January 2013|publisher=Central European University Press|pages=189\u2013202|accessdate=29 August 2019|via=OpenEdition Books}}</ref>\n\nUnder the regime, the Romani were excluded in the list of \"co-inhabiting nationalities\" drafted by the regime, and lacked any representation in government as an ethnic group. This was the case even after representation increased for other minorities such as [[Hungarians]] and [[Germans]]. Ceau\u0219escu largely wished to conjure away the living conditions of the Romani, which were ignored by his predecessors and put in place as early as the regime of [[Ion Antonescu]].<ref name=\"books.openedition.org\"/>\n\nThe result of the neglect of the Romani, who had long since been a highly vulnerable ethnic minority group across Europe, left the majority of Romani people in Romania in significant poverty and at risk to hate-crimes. Such conditions have lasted into modern-day Romania with the policies of several subsequent presidents.\n\n==Revolution and death ==\n{{Main|Romanian Revolution}}\n[[File:Ceausescu, Nicolae.jpg|thumb|Ceau\u0219escu in 1988]]\nIn November 1989, the XIVth Congress of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) saw Ceau\u0219escu, then aged 71, re-elected for another five years as leader of the PCR. During the Congress, Ceau\u0219escu made a speech denouncing the anti-Communist revolutions happening throughout the rest of Eastern Europe. The following month, Ceau\u0219escu's government itself collapsed after a series of violent events in [[Timi\u0219oara]] and [[Bucharest]].\n\n===Timi\u0219oara===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2018}}\n\nDemonstrations in the city of Timi\u0219oara (Temesv\u00e1r) were triggered by the government-sponsored attempt to evict [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u0151k\u00e9s]], an ethnic Hungarian pastor, accused by the government of inciting [[ethnic hatred]]. Members of his ethnic Hungarian [[wikt:congregation|congregation]] surrounded his apartment in a show of support.\n\nRomanian students spontaneously joined the demonstration, which soon lost nearly all connection to its initial cause and became a more general anti-government demonstration. Regular military forces, police, and the Securitate fired on demonstrators on 17 December 1989, killing and injuring men, women, and children.\n\nOn 18 December 1989, Ceau\u0219escu departed for a state visit to [[Iran]], leaving the duty of crushing the Timi\u0219oara revolt to his subordinates and his wife. Upon his return to Romania on the evening of December 20, the situation became even more tense, and he gave a televised speech from the TV studio inside the Central Committee Building (CC Building), in which he spoke about the events at Timi\u0219oara in terms of an \"interference of foreign forces in Romania's internal affairs\" and an \"external aggression on Romania's sovereignty.\"\n\nThe country, which had little to no information of the events transpiring in Timi\u0219oara from the national media, learned about the revolt from radio stations (such as [[Voice of America]] and [[Radio Free Europe]]) and by word of mouth. On the next day, December 21, Ceau\u0219escu staged a [[Ceausescu's final speech|mass meeting in Bucharest]]. Official media presented it as a \"spontaneous movement of support for Ceau\u0219escu\", emulating the [[Ceausescu's speech of 21 August 1968|1968 meeting]] in which he had spoken against the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact forces.\n\n===Overthrow===\n====Speech on December 21st====\n{{Main|Ceau\u0219escu's final speech}}\nThe mass meeting of December 21, held in what is now [[Revolution Square, Bucharest|Revolution Square]], began like many of Ceau\u0219escu's speeches over the years.  He spoke of the achievements of the \"Socialist revolution\" and Romania's \"multi-laterally developed Socialist society.\"  He also blamed the Timi\u0219oara riots on \"fascist agitators who want to destroy socialism.\"<ref>Text of Speech in Revolution Square, 21 December 1989</ref>\n\nHowever, Ceau\u0219escu had misjudged the crowd's mood.  Roughly eight minutes into his speech, several people began jeering and booing, and others began chanting \"[[Timi\u0219oara]]!\" He tried to silence them by raising his right hand and calling for the crowd's attention before order was temporarily restored, then proceeded to announce social benefit reforms that included raising the national minimum wage by 200 [[Romanian lei|lei]] per month to a total of 2,200 per month by January 1.  Images of Ceau\u0219escu's facial expression as the crowd began to boo and heckle him were among the most widely broadcast of the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe.<ref name=Revolution1989>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=978-0-375-42532-5|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref>\n\nFailing to control the crowd, the Ceau\u0219escus finally took cover inside the building that housed the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party. The rest of the day saw an open revolt of Bucharest's population, which had assembled in University Square and confronted the police and army at barricades. The rioters, however, were no match for the military apparatus concentrated in Bucharest, which cleared the streets by midnight and arrested hundreds of people in the process.\n\n====Flight on December 22nd====\nBy the morning of December 22, the [[rebellion]] had already spread to all major cities across the country. The suspicious death of [[Vasile Milea]], Ceau\u0219escu's [[defence minister]], later confirmed as a suicide (he tried to incapacitate himself with a flesh wound but a bullet severed his artery),<ref>Marcau, Flavius Cristian, [http://www.utgjiu.ro/revista/lit/pdf/2013-04/16_Flavius%20Cristian%20Marcau%20-%20Revolution%20of%201989%20-%20Milea%60s%20suicide.pdf \"Revolution of 1989: Milea's Suicide\"], University of T\u00e2rgu Jiu, Letter and Social Science Series, Issue 4, 2013, Retrieved February 27, 2016.</ref> was announced by the media. Immediately thereafter, Ceau\u0219escu presided over the CPEx (Political Executive Committee) meeting and assumed the leadership of the army.\nBelieving that Milea had been murdered, rank-and-file soldiers switched sides to the revolution almost ''en masse''.  The commanders wrote off Ceau\u0219escu as a lost cause and made no effort to keep their men loyal to the government. Ceau\u0219escu made a last desperate attempt to address the crowd gathered in front of the Central Committee building, but the people in the square began throwing stones and other projectiles at him, forcing him to take refuge in the building once more.  One group of protesters forced open the doors of the building, by now left unprotected.  They managed to overpower Ceau\u0219escu's bodyguards and rushed through his office and onto the balcony.  Although they did not know it, they were only a few metres from Ceau\u0219escu, who was trapped in an elevator.  He, Elena and four others managed to get to the roof and escape by helicopter, only seconds ahead of a group of demonstrators who had followed them there.<ref name=Revolution1989/> The [[Romanian Communist Party]] disappeared soon afterwards; unlike its kindred parties in the former Soviet bloc, it has never been revived.\n\nDuring the course of the revolution, the Western press{{who?|date=January 2020}} published estimates of the number of people killed by [[Securitate]] forces in an attempt to support Ceau\u0219escu and quell the rebellion{{fact?|date=January 2020}}.

They abandoned the helicopter near T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, having been ordered to land by the army, which by that time had restricted flying in Romania's airspace.

Ceau\u0219escu repeatedly denied the court's authority to try him, and asserted he was still legally the President of Romania. At the end of the quick [[show trial]], the Ceau\u0219escus were found guilty and sentenced to death. A soldier standing guard in the proceedings was ordered to take the Ceau\u0219escus out the back one by one and shoot them, but the Ceau\u0219escus demanded to die together.

This can be explained by the largely crude and [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]] character of the dogma. Ceau\u0219escu attempted to [[Revisionism (Marxism)|include his views]] in mainstream [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, to which he added his belief in a \"multilaterally developed Socialist society\" as a necessary stage between the [[Marxism-Leninism|Leninist]] concepts of [[Socialist mode of production|Socialist]] and [[Communist society|Communist societies]] (a critical view reveals that the main reason for the interval is the [[Withering away of the state|disappearance of the State]] and Party structures in Communism). A Romanian Encyclopedic Dictionary entry in 1978 underlines the concept as \"a new, superior, stage in the Socialist development of Romania [...] begun by the 1971\u20131975 Five-Year Plan, prolonged over several [succeeding and projected] Five-Year Plans\".<ref>''Mic Dic\u021bionar Enciclopedic''</ref>\n\nCeau\u0219ism's main trait was a form of [[Romanian nationalism]],<ref>Geran Pilon, Chapter III, ''Communism with a Nationalist Face'', pp. 60\u201366; T\u0103nase, p. 24</ref> one which arguably propelled Ceau\u0219escu to power in 1965, and probably accounted for the Party leadership under [[Ion Gheorghe Maurer]] choosing him over the more orthodox [[Gheorghe Apostol]]. Although he had previously been a careful supporter of the official lines, Ceau\u0219escu came to embody Romanian society's wish for independence after what many considered years of Soviet directives and purges, during and after the [[SovRom]] fiasco. He carried this nationalist option inside the Party, manipulating it against the nominated successor Apostol. This nationalist policy had more timid precedents:<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Geran Pilon, p.60</ref> for example, Gheorghiu-Dej had overseen the withdrawal of the [[Red Army]] in 1958.\n\n[[File:Moldovan workers during Ceausescu visit (1972). (14549532742).jpg|thumb|Moldovan workers during Ceau\u0219escu's visit to [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Moldavia]] in 1972]]\nIt had also engineered the publishing of several works that subverted the Russian and Soviet image, such as the final volumes of the official ''History of Romania'', no longer glossing over traditional points of tension with Russia and the Soviet Union (even alluding to an unlawful Soviet presence in Bessarabia). In the final years of Gheorghiu-Dej's rule, more problems were openly discussed, with the publication of a collection of [[Karl Marx]]'s writings that dealt with Romanian topics, showing Marx's previously censored, politically uncomfortable views of Russia.\n\nCeau\u0219escu was prepared to take a more decisive step in questioning Soviet policies. In the early years of his rule, he generally relaxed political pressures inside Romanian society,<ref>T\u0103nase, p.23</ref> which led to the late 1960s and early 1970s being the most liberal decade in Socialist Romania. Gaining the public's confidence, Ceau\u0219escu took a clear stand against the 1968 crushing of the [[Prague Spring]] by [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. After a visit from [[Charles de Gaulle]] earlier in the same year, during which the French President gave recognition to the incipient maverick, Ceau\u0219escu's public speech in August deeply impressed the population, not only through its themes, but also because, uniquely, it was unscripted. He immediately attracted Western sympathies and backing, which lasted well beyond the 'liberal' phase of his rule; at the same time, the period brought forward the threat of armed Soviet invasion: significantly, many young men inside Romania joined the ''[[Patriotic Guards (Romania)|Patriotic Guards]]'' created on the spur of the moment, in order to meet the perceived threat.<ref>Geran Pilon, p.62</ref> President Richard Nixon was invited to Bucharest in 1969, which was the first visit of a United States president to a communist country after the start of the Cold War.\n\n[[Alexander Dub\u010dek]]'s version of ''[[Socialism with a human face]]'' was never suited to Romanian Communist goals. Ceau\u0219escu found himself briefly aligned with Dub\u010dek's [[Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The latter friendship was to last until Tito's death in 1980, with Ceau\u0219escu adapting the [[Titoism|Titoist]] doctrine of \"independent Socialist development\" to suit his own objectives. Romania proclaimed itself a \"Socialist\" (in place of \"People's\") Republic to show that it was fulfilling Marxist goals without Moscow's oversight.\n\nThe system's nationalist traits grew and progressively blended with [[North Korea]]n ''[[Juche]]'' and [[China|Chinese]] [[Maoism|Maoist]] ideals. In 1971, the Party, which had already been completely purged of internal opposition (with the possible exception of [[Gheorghe Gaston Marin]]),<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> approved the ''[[July Theses]]'', expressing Ceau\u0219escu's disdain of Western models as a whole, and the reevaluation of the recent liberalisation as ''[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]''. The 1974 XIth Party Congress tightened the Party's grip on Romanian culture, guiding it towards Ceau\u0219escu's nationalist principles.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Geran Pilon, p.61</ref> Notably, it demanded that Romanian historians refer to [[Dacians]] as having \"an unorganised State\", part of a political continuum that culminated in the Socialist Republic.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> The government continued its cultural dialogue with ancient forms, with Ceau\u0219escu connecting his cult of personality to figures such as [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n]] (lit. \"Mircea the Elder\", whom he styled \"Mircea the Great\") and [[Mihai Viteazul]] (Michael the Brave). It also started adding Dacian or [[Imperial Rome|Roman]] versions to the names of cities and towns (''Drobeta'' to [[Turnu Severin]], ''Napoca'' to [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]]).<ref>Geran Pilon, pp. 61\u201363</ref> Although Ceau\u0219escu maintained an independent, \"national Communist\" course, his absolute control over the country, as well as the intensity of the personality cult surrounding him, led many non-Romanian observers to describe his rule as one of the closest things to an old-style Stalinist regime. The last edition of the [[Country Studies|Country Study]] on Romania, for instance, referred to the PCR's \"Stalinist repression of individual liberties.\"<ref>http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+ro0010%29</ref> A new generation of committed supporters on the outside confirmed the administration's character. Ceau\u0219escu probably never emphasized that his policies constituted a paradigm for theorists of [[National Bolshevism]] such as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Thiriart]], but there was a publicised connection between him and [[Iosif Constantin Dr\u0103gan]], an [[Iron Guard]]ist Romanian-Italian \u00e9migr\u00e9 millionaire (Dr\u0103gan was already committed to a Dacian [[Protochronism]] that largely echoed the official cultural policy).\n\nNicolae Ceau\u0219escu had a major influence on modern-day Romanian populist rhetoric. In his final years, he had begun to rehabilitate the image of pro-[[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] dictator [[Ion Antonescu]]. Although Antonescu's image was never a fully official myth in Ceau\u0219escu's time, today's politicians such as [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]] have coupled the images of the two leaders into their versions of a national Pantheon. The conflict with Hungary over the treatment of the [[Hungarian minority in Romania|Magyar minority]] in Romania had several unusual aspects: not only was it a vitriolic argument between two officially [[Socialist state]]s, it also marked the moment when Hungary, a state behind the [[Iron Curtain]], appealed to the [[Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] for sanctions to be taken against Romania. This meant that the later 1980s were marked by a pronounced anti-Hungarian discourse, which owed more to nationalist tradition than to Marxism,<ref>Geran Pilon, p.63</ref> and the ultimate isolation of Romania on the world stage.\n\nThe strong opposition to Ceau\u0219escu on all forms of ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'' placed Ceau\u0219escu at odds with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. He was very displeased when other Warsaw Pact countries decided to try their own versions of Gorbachev's reforms. In particular, he was incensed when [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]]'s leaders opted for a power-sharing arrangement with the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] trade union. He even went as far as to call for a Warsaw Pact invasion of Poland\u2014a significant reversal, considering how violently he opposed the invasion of Czechoslovakia 20 years earlier. For his part, Gorbachev made no secret of his distaste for Ceau\u0219escu, whom he called \"the Romanian [[f\u00fchrer]].\" At a meeting between the two, Gorbachev upbraided Ceau\u0219escu for his inflexible attitude. \"You are running a dictatorship here,\" the Soviet leader warned.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nIn November 1989, at the XIVth and last congress of the PCR, Ceau\u0219escu condemned the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] and asked for the annulment of its consequences. In effect, this amounted to a demand for the return of Bessarabia (most of which was then a Soviet republic and since 1991 has been independent [[Moldova]]) and northern [[Bukovina]], both of which had been [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupied by the Soviet Union]] in 1940 and again at the end of World War II.\n\n===Non-aligned policy feats===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0529-029, Berlin, Tagung Warschauer Pakt, Gruppenfoto.jpg|thumb|[[Warsaw Pact]] leaders in 1987 from left to right: [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k|Hus\u00e1k]] of [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Todor Zhivkov|Zhivkov]] of [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Erich Honecker|Honecker]] of [[East Germany]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] of the [[Soviet Union]], Ceau\u0219escu, [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski]] of [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r|K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] of [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]]]]\n\nCeau\u0219escu's Romania was the only Eastern Bloc country that retained diplomatic relations with Israel and did not sever diplomatic relations after Israel's pre-emptive strike against [[Egypt]] at the start of the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. Ceau\u0219escu made efforts to act as a mediator between the [[PLO]] and [[Israel]].\n\nSimilarly, Romania was the only Eastern Bloc country to attend the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], which had been [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotted]] by the Soviets and the rest of their allies in response to the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led boycott]] of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow.\n\nCeau\u0219escu's Romania was the only [[Warsaw Pact]] country that did not sever diplomatic relations with [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u201390)|Chile]] after [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|Augusto Pinochet's coup]].<ref>Valenzuela, J.

Relations were in fact not just state-to-state, but party-to-party between their respective [[One-party state|political machineries]], the [[Popular Movement of the Revolution|MPR]] and the [[Romanian Communist Party|PCR]].

In December 1976, at one of his meetings in Bucharest, [[Ivan Bodiul]] said that \"the good relationship was initiated by Ceau\u0219escu's visit to Soviet Moldova\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/53-1-68.shtml|title=Romanian-Moldavian SSR relations, by Patrick Moore and the Romanian Section|publisher=}}</ref> The final volumes of the official ''History of Romania'' alluded to an unlawful Soviet presence in Bessarabia.\n\n===Personality cult and totalitarianism===\n[[File:TimbruNicolaeCeausescu.png|thumb|Stamp commemorating the 70th birthday (and 55 years of political activity) of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, 1988]]\n{{main|Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu's cult of personality}}\nCeau\u0219escu created a pervasive [[Cult of personality|personality cult]], giving himself such titles as \"[[Conduc\u0103tor]]\" (\"Leader\") and \"Geniul din Carpa\u021bi\" (\"The Genius of the Carpathians\"), with inspiration from [[Proletarian Culture]] ([[Proletkult]]). After his election as President of Romania, he even had a [[Kings of Romania|king]]-like [[sceptre]] made for himself.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=September 2019}} \n\nThe most important day of the year during Ceau\u0219escu's rule was his birthday, 26 January \u2013 a day which saw Romanian media saturated with praise for him. According to historian [[Victor Sebestyen]], it was one of the few days of the year when the average Romanian put on a happy face, since appearing miserable on this day was too risky to contemplate.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nSuch excesses prompted painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] to send a congratulatory telegram to the Romanian president, in which he sarcastically congratulated Ceau\u0219escu on his \"introducing the presidential sceptre\". The Communist Party daily ''[[Sc\u00eenteia]]'' published the message, unaware that it was a work of satire. To lessen the chance of further treason after Pacepa's defection, Ceau\u0219escu also invested his wife Elena and other members of his family with important positions in the government. This led Romanians to joke that Ceau\u0219escu was creating \"[[socialism in one country|socialism in one family]]\".{{Cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nNot surprisingly, Ceau\u0219escu was greatly concerned about his public image. For years, nearly all official photographs of him showed him in his late 40s. Romanian state television was under strict orders to portray him in the best possible light.<ref name=Revolution1989/> Additionally, producers had to take great care to make sure that Ceau\u0219escu's height (he was only {{convert|1.68|m}} tall<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realitatea.net/un-ceausescu-pe-care-nu-il-stiati-cret-cu-ochii-blonzi-si-nasul-borcanat_858565.html|title=Un Ceau\u015fescu pe care nu \u00eel \u015ftia\u0163i: cre\u0163, cu ochii \"blonzi\" \u015fi nasul borc\u0103nat|language=Romanian|publisher=Realitatea.net|date=3 August 2011|accessdate=July 22, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726194246/http://www.realitatea.net/un-ceausescu-pe-care-nu-il-stiati-cret-cu-ochii-blonzi-si-nasul-borcanat_858565.html|archivedate=26 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>) was never emphasized on screen. Consequences for breaking these rules were severe; one producer showed footage of Ceau\u0219escu blinking and stuttering, and was banned for three months.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nAs part of a propaganda ploy arranged by the Ceau\u0219escus through the consular cultural attach\u00e9s of Romanian embassies, they managed to receive orders and titles from numerous states and institutions. France granted Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu the [[Legion of Honour]]. In 1978 he became a Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Bath]] (GCB) in the [[UK]],<ref>[[List of honorary British Knights]]</ref> a title of which he was stripped in 1989. Elena Ceau\u0219escu was arranged to be \"elected\" to membership of a science academy in the U.S.\n\nTo execute a massive redevelopment project during the rule of Nicolae Ceausescu, the government conducted extensive demolition of churches and many other historic structures in Romania. According to Alexandru Budistenu, former chief architect of Bucharest, \"The sight of a church bothered Ceausescu.  It didn't matter if they demolished or moved it, as long as it was no longer in sight.\" Nevertheless, a project organized by Romanian engineer Eugeniu Iordachescu was able to move many historic structures to less-prominent sites and save them.<ref>Smith, Harrison.

He was the [[Romanian Communist Party#General Secretaries (1921\u20131989)|general secretary]] of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] from 1965 to 1989 and hence the second and last [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist leader]] of Romania. He was also the country's head of state from 1967, serving as President of the [[State Council of Romania|State Council]] and from 1974 concurrently as [[President of Romania|President of the Republic]] until his overthrow and execution in the [[Romanian Revolution]] in December 1989, part of a series of [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] and [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet Union]] uprisings in [[Eastern Europe]] that year.\n\nBorn in 1918 in [[Scornice\u0219ti]], [[Olt County]], Ceau\u0219escu was a member of the Romanian Communist youth movement. Ceau\u0219escu rose up through the ranks of [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]]'s Socialist government and, upon Gheorghiu-Dej's death in 1965, he succeeded to the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party as general secretary.<ref>Behr, E.

London: Hamish Hamilton.</ref>\n\nUpon his rise to power, he eased [[Censorship in Communist Romania|press censorship]] and openly condemned the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in his [[Ceau\u0219escu's speech of 21 August 1968|speech on 21 August 1968]], which resulted in a surge in popularity. However, the resulting period of stability was very brief as his government very soon became severely [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] and was considered the most repressive in the [[Eastern Bloc]] at the time. His [[secret police]], the [[Securitate]], was responsible for [[mass surveillance]] as well as [[Securitate#Method|severe repression]] and human rights abuses within the country, and he suppressed and controlled the media and press, implementing methods that were among the harshest, most restrictive and brutal in the world. Economic mismanagement [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu#Oil embargo, strike and foreign relations|due to failed oil ventures during the 1970s]] led to skyrocketing foreign debts for Romania. In 1982, he exported much of the country's agricultural and industrial production in an effort to repay them. The shortages that followed drastically lowered living standards, leading to [[1980s austerity policy in Romania|heavy rationing of food, water, oil, heat, electricity, medicine and other necessities]].

In 1952, Gheorghiu-Dej brought him onto the [[Central Committee]] months after the party's \"Muscovite faction\" led by [[Ana Pauker]] had been purged. In the late 1940s-early 1950s, the Party had been divided into the \"home communists\" headed by Gheorghiu-Dej who remained inside Romania prior to 1944 and the \"Muscovites\" who had gone into exile in the Soviet Union. With the partial exception of Poland, where the [[Polish October]] crisis of 1956 brought to power the previously imprisoned \"home communist\" [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], Romania was the only Eastern European nation where the \"home communists\" triumphed over the \"Muscovites\". In the rest of the Soviet bloc, there were a series of purges in this period that led to the \"home communists\" being executed or imprisoned. Like his patron Gheorghiu-Dej, Ceau\u0219escu was a \"home communist\" who benefited from the fall of the \"Muscovites\" in 1952.

In 1967, he consolidated his power by becoming president of the [[State Council of Romania|State Council]], making him ''de jure'' head of state.

In the 1960s, he eased press censorship and ended Romania's active participation in the Warsaw Pact, but Romania formally remained a member.

This quasi-[[Maoism|Maoist]] speech, which came to be known as the [[July Theses]], contained seventeen proposals. Among these were: continuous growth in the \"leading role\" of the Party; improvement of Party education and of mass political action; youth participation on large construction projects as part of their \"patriotic work\"; an intensification of political-ideological education in schools and universities, as well as in children's, youth and student organizations; and an expansion of political propaganda, orienting radio and television shows to this end, as well as publishing houses, theatres and cinemas, opera, ballet, artists' unions, promoting a \"militant, revolutionary\" character in artistic productions. The [[De-Stalinization in Romania|liberalization of 1965]] was condemned and an index of banned books and authors was re-established.\n\nThe Theses heralded the beginning of a \"mini cultural revolution\" in Romania, launching a [[Neo-Stalinism|Neo-Stalinist]] offensive against cultural autonomy, reaffirming an ideological basis for literature that, in theory, the Party had hardly abandoned. Although presented in terms of \"Socialist Humanism\", the Theses in fact marked a return to the strict guidelines of [[Socialist realism in Romania|Socialist Realism]], and attacks on non-compliant intellectuals. Strict ideological conformity in the humanities and social sciences was demanded. Competence and aesthetics were to be replaced by ideology; professionals were to be replaced by [[Agitprop|agitators]]; and culture was once again to become an instrument for political-ideological propaganda and hardline measures. In a 1972 speech, Ceau\u0219escu stated he wanted \" a certain blending of party and state activities...in the long run we shall witness an ever closer blending of the activities of the party, state and other social bodies.\"<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 354\">Crampton, Richard ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century-And After'', London: Routledge, 1997 page 354.</ref> In practice, a number of joint party-state organizations were founded such as the Council for Socialist Education and Culture, which had no precise counterpart in any of the other communist states of Eastern Europe, and the Romanian Communist Party was embedded into the daily life of the nation in a way that it never had been before.<ref>Crampton, Richard ''Eastern Europe In the Twentieth Century-And After'', London: Routledge, 1997 pages 354\u2013355.</ref> In 1974, the party programme of the Romanian Communist Party announced that structural changes in society were insufficient to create a full socialist consciousness in the people, and that a full socialist consciousness could only come about if the entire population was made aware of socialist values that guided society.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 354\"/> The Communist Party was to be the agency that would so \"enlighten\" the population and in the words of the British historian Richard Crampton \"...the party would merge state and society, the individual and the collective, and would promote 'the ever more organic participation of party members in the entire social life'\".<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 354\"/>\n\n=== President of the Socialist Republic of Romania ===\n[[File:Flag of Chairman of Councils of State and of Ministers of Romania.svg|thumb|Standard as President of Romania]]\nIn 1974, Ceau\u0219escu converted his post of president of the State Council to a full-fledged [[President of Romania|executive presidency]]. He was first elected to this post [[1974 Romanian presidential election|in 1974]], and would be reelected every five years until 1989.\n\nAlthough Ceau\u0219escu had been nominal head of state since 1967, he had merely been first among equals on the State Council, deriving his real power coming from his status as party leader. The new post, however, made him the nation's top decision-maker both in name and in fact. He was empowered to carry out those functions of the State Council that did not require [[plenum (meeting)|plenums]]. He also appointed and dismissed the president of the Supreme Court and the prosecutor general whenever the legislature was not in session. In practice, from 1974 onward Ceau\u0219escu frequently ruled by decree.<ref>Grosescu, R. (2004). \"The Political Regrouping of Romanian Nomenklatura during the 1989 Revolution\".

The principles of democratic centralism, combined with the legislature's infrequent sessions (it sat in full session only twice a year) meant that for all intents and purposes, his decisions had the force of law.\n\n===Oil embargo, strike and foreign relations===\nStarting with the [[1973 oil crisis|1973\u201374 Arab oil embargo]] against the West, a period of prolonged high oil prices set in that characterised the rest of the 1970s. Romania as a major oil producer greatly benefited from the high oil prices of the 1970s, which led Ceau\u0219escu to embark on an ambitious plan to invest heavily in oil-refining plants.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 356\">Crampton, Richard ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century-And After'', London: Routledge, 1997 page 356.</ref> Ceau\u0219escu's plan was to make Romania into Europe's number one oil refiner not only of its oil, but also of oil from Middle Eastern states like Iraq and Iran, and then to sell all of the refined oil at a profit on the Rotterdam spot market.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 356\" /> As Romania lacked the money to build the necessary oil refining plants and Ceau\u0219escu chose to spend the windfall from the high oil prices on aid to the Third World in an attempt to buy Romania international influence, Ceau\u0219escu borrowed heavily from Western banks on the assumption that when the loans came due, the profits from the sales of the refined oil would be more than enough to pay off the loans.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 356\" /> A major problem with Ceau\u0219escu's oil-refining plan which led to Romania taking enormous loans was the low productivity of Romanian workers, which meant that the oil-refining plants were finished years behind schedule.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 356\" /> [[1977 Vrancea earthquake|The 1977 earthquake]] which destroyed much of Bucharest also led to delays in the oil plan.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 356\" /> By the time the oil refining plants were finished in the early 1980s, a slump in oil prices had set in, leading to major financial problems for Romania.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 356\" />\n\n[[File:Ceausescu and Carter 2.jpg|thumb|Ceau\u0219escu with [[Jimmy Carter]] during a visit in Washington, D.C. in 1978]]\nIn August 1977 over 30,000 miners went on strike in the [[Jiu River]] valley complaining of low pay and poor working conditions.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 355\" /> The [[Jiu Valley miners' strike of 1977|Jiu valley miners' strike]] was the most significant expression of opposition to Ceau\u0219escu's rule prior to the late 1980s. The striking miners were inspired by similar strikes along Poland's Baltic coast in December 1970, and just as in Poland in 1970, the striking Romanian miners demanded face-to-face negotiations with their nation's leader.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 355\" /> When Ceau\u0219escu appeared before the miners on the third day of the strike, he was greeted in the words of the British historian Richard Crampton \"... once again ''\u00e1 la polonaise'', with cries of 'Down with the Red Bourgeoisie!'\".<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 355\" /> Hearing reports that his soldiers were reluctant to fire on fellow Romanians led Ceau\u0219escu to negotiate a compromise solution to the strike.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 355\" /> In the years after the strike, the majority of its leaders died of cancer. After 1989, it was revealed that the ''Securitate'' had doctors give the strike leaders 5-minute chest X-rays to ensure the development of cancer.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 355\" />\n\nHe continued to follow an independent policy in foreign relations\u2014for example, in 1984, Romania was one of few communist states (notably including the People's Republic of China, and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) to take part in the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles, despite a Soviet-led boycott.\n\n[[File:Mugabe76Romania.jpg|thumb|Ceau\u0219escu in a meeting with [[Robert Mugabe]] in 1979]]\nAlso, the Socialist Republic of Romania was the first of the [[Eastern bloc]] nations to have official relations with the [[Western bloc]] and the [[European Community]]: an agreement including Romania in the Community's Generalised System of Preferences was signed in 1974 and an Agreement on Industrial Products was signed in 1980. On 4 April 1975, Ceau\u0219escu visited Japan and met with [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]].\n\nIn June 1978, Ceau\u0219escu made a state visit to the UK where a \u00a3200m licensing agreement was signed between the Romanian government and [[British Aerospace]] for the production of more than eighty [[BAC One-Eleven]] aircraft. The deal was said at the time to be the biggest between two countries involving a civil aircraft.<ref>{{cite news|title=Britain and Romania sign \u00a3200m plane deal|last=Spainer|first=David|date=16 June 1978|work=The Times|page=1|location=London}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1978, Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Michael O'Kennedy]] met Romanian leader Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu when he stopped off at the [[Shannon Airport]] on his way to visit [[Jimmy Carter]] in the United States. This kind of activity was an aspect of O'Kennedy's duties as international leaders often stopped at the airport on their way to the US. Ceau\u0219escu told journalists \"that there was a great similarity between the Romanian and Irish people in that they were hard working, diligent and endeavoured to maintain their independence and sovereignty.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/ceausescu-expected-fanfare-on-stopover-81021.html|title=Ceausescu expected fanfare on stopover|date=1 January 2009|website=www.irishexaminer.com|accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Pacepa defection===\nIn 1978, [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], a senior member of the Romanian political police ([[Securitate]], State Security), defected to the United States. A three-star general, he was the highest ranking defector from the [[Eastern Bloc]] during the [[Cold War]]. His defection was a powerful blow against the administration, forcing Ceau\u0219escu to overhaul the architecture of the Security. Pacepa's 1986 book, ''Red Horizons: Chronicles of a Communist Spy Chief'' ({{ISBN|0-89526-570-2}}), claims to expose details of Ceau\u0219escu's government activities, such as massive spying on American industry and elaborate efforts to rally Western political support.\n\n===Foreign debt===\n{{main|1980s austerity policy in Romania}}\n[[File:Personality Cult Romania 1986.jpg|thumb|left|By the 1980s, the Ceau\u0219escus had developed a [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu's cult of personality|personality cult]]. ]]\nCeau\u0219escu's political independence from the Soviet Union and his protest against the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]] drew the interest of Western powers, whose governments briefly believed that he was an anti-Soviet maverick and hoped to create a schism in the Warsaw Pact by funding him. Ceau\u0219escu did not realise that the funding was not always favorable. Ceau\u0219escu was able to borrow heavily (more than $13&nbsp;billion) from the West to finance economic development programs, but these loans ultimately devastated the country's finances.  He also secured a deal for cheap oil from [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]], but that deal fell through after the Shah was [[Iranian Revolution|overthrown]].\n\nIn an attempt to correct this, Ceau\u0219escu decided to repay Romania's [[foreign debt]]s. He organised a referendum and managed to change the constitution, adding a clause that barred Romania from taking foreign loans in the future. According to official results, the referendum yielded a nearly unanimous \"yes\" vote.<ref>Mungiu\u2010Pippidi, A. (2001). \"The Return of Populism\u2010The 2000 Romanian Elections\". ''[[Government and Opposition]]'', 36(2), 230\u2013252.</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, Ceau\u0219escu ordered the export of much of the country's agricultural and industrial production in order to repay its debts. The resulting domestic shortages made the everyday lives of Romanians a fight for survival as food rationing was introduced and heating, gas and electricity blackouts became the rule. During the 1980s, there was a steady decrease in the Romanian population's living standards, especially in the availability and quality of food and general goods in shops. During this time, all regional radio stations were closed, and television was limited to a single channel broadcasting for only two hours a day.\n\nThe debt was fully paid in the summer of 1989, shortly before Ceau\u0219escu was overthrown.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\n===1984 failed coup d'\u00e9tat attempt===\nA tentative [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] planned in October 1984 failed when the military unit assigned to carry out the plan was sent to harvest maize instead.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ceau\u015fescu and the Securitate: Coercion and Dissent in Romania, 1965\u20131989|first=Dennis|last=Deletant|page=351|isbn=978-1563246333|publisher=M.E.Sharpe|year=1995}}</ref>\n\n===Romani Rights===\nDuring the Ceau\u0219escu regime, the [[Romani people|Romani]] were largely neglected. This can be seen, perhaps most blatantly, with a motion from the [[Romanian Communist Party|Politburo of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers Party]], which largely laid the foundation for the Ceau\u0219escu regime's policies regarding the rights of ethnic minorities. The motion ignored the Romani entirely.<ref name=\"books.openedition.org\">{{Cite book|url=http://books.openedition.org/ceup/1554|title=The Roma in Romanian History|first=Viorel|last=Achim|date=23 January 2013|publisher=Central European University Press|pages=189\u2013202|accessdate=29 August 2019|via=OpenEdition Books}}</ref>\n\nUnder the regime, the Romani were excluded in the list of \"co-inhabiting nationalities\" drafted by the regime, and lacked any representation in government as an ethnic group. This was the case even after representation increased for other minorities such as [[Hungarians]] and [[Germans]]. Ceau\u0219escu largely wished to conjure away the living conditions of the Romani, which were ignored by his predecessors and put in place as early as the regime of [[Ion Antonescu]].<ref name=\"books.openedition.org\"/>\n\nThe result of the neglect of the Romani, who had long since been a highly vulnerable ethnic minority group across Europe, left the majority of Romani people in Romania in significant poverty and at risk to hate-crimes. Such conditions have lasted into modern-day Romania with the policies of several subsequent presidents.\n\n==Revolution and death ==\n{{Main|Romanian Revolution}}\n[[File:Ceausescu, Nicolae.jpg|thumb|Ceau\u0219escu in 1988]]\nIn November 1989, the XIVth Congress of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) saw Ceau\u0219escu, then aged 71, re-elected for another five years as leader of the PCR. During the Congress, Ceau\u0219escu made a speech denouncing the anti-Communist revolutions happening throughout the rest of Eastern Europe. The following month, Ceau\u0219escu's government itself collapsed after a series of violent events in [[Timi\u0219oara]] and [[Bucharest]].\n\n===Timi\u0219oara===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2018}}\n\nDemonstrations in the city of Timi\u0219oara (Temesv\u00e1r) were triggered by the government-sponsored attempt to evict [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u0151k\u00e9s]], an ethnic Hungarian pastor, accused by the government of inciting [[ethnic hatred]]. Members of his ethnic Hungarian [[wikt:congregation|congregation]] surrounded his apartment in a show of support.\n\nRomanian students spontaneously joined the demonstration, which soon lost nearly all connection to its initial cause and became a more general anti-government demonstration. Regular military forces, police, and the Securitate fired on demonstrators on 17 December 1989, killing and injuring men, women, and children.\n\nOn 18 December 1989, Ceau\u0219escu departed for a state visit to [[Iran]], leaving the duty of crushing the Timi\u0219oara revolt to his subordinates and his wife. Upon his return to Romania on the evening of December 20, the situation became even more tense, and he gave a televised speech from the TV studio inside the Central Committee Building (CC Building), in which he spoke about the events at Timi\u0219oara in terms of an \"interference of foreign forces in Romania's internal affairs\" and an \"external aggression on Romania's sovereignty.\"\n\nThe country, which had little to no information of the events transpiring in Timi\u0219oara from the national media, learned about the revolt from radio stations (such as [[Voice of America]] and [[Radio Free Europe]]) and by word of mouth. On the next day, December 21, Ceau\u0219escu staged a [[Ceausescu's final speech|mass meeting in Bucharest]]. Official media presented it as a \"spontaneous movement of support for Ceau\u0219escu\", emulating the [[Ceausescu's speech of 21 August 1968|1968 meeting]] in which he had spoken against the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact forces.\n\n===Overthrow===\n====Speech on December 21st====\n{{Main|Ceau\u0219escu's final speech}}\nThe mass meeting of December 21, held in what is now [[Revolution Square, Bucharest|Revolution Square]], began like many of Ceau\u0219escu's speeches over the years.  He spoke of the achievements of the \"Socialist revolution\" and Romania's \"multi-laterally developed Socialist society.\"  He also blamed the Timi\u0219oara riots on \"fascist agitators who want to destroy socialism.\"<ref>Text of Speech in Revolution Square, 21 December 1989</ref>\n\nHowever, Ceau\u0219escu had misjudged the crowd's mood.  Roughly eight minutes into his speech, several people began jeering and booing, and others began chanting \"[[Timi\u0219oara]]!\" He tried to silence them by raising his right hand and calling for the crowd's attention before order was temporarily restored, then proceeded to announce social benefit reforms that included raising the national minimum wage by 200 [[Romanian lei|lei]] per month to a total of 2,200 per month by January 1.  Images of Ceau\u0219escu's facial expression as the crowd began to boo and heckle him were among the most widely broadcast of the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe.<ref name=Revolution1989>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=978-0-375-42532-5|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref>\n\nFailing to control the crowd, the Ceau\u0219escus finally took cover inside the building that housed the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party. The rest of the day saw an open revolt of Bucharest's population, which had assembled in University Square and confronted the police and army at barricades. The rioters, however, were no match for the military apparatus concentrated in Bucharest, which cleared the streets by midnight and arrested hundreds of people in the process.\n\n====Flight on December 22nd====\nBy the morning of December 22, the [[rebellion]] had already spread to all major cities across the country. The suspicious death of [[Vasile Milea]], Ceau\u0219escu's [[defence minister]], later confirmed as a suicide (he tried to incapacitate himself with a flesh wound but a bullet severed his artery),<ref>Marcau, Flavius Cristian, [http://www.utgjiu.ro/revista/lit/pdf/2013-04/16_Flavius%20Cristian%20Marcau%20-%20Revolution%20of%201989%20-%20Milea%60s%20suicide.pdf \"Revolution of 1989: Milea's Suicide\"], University of T\u00e2rgu Jiu, Letter and Social Science Series, Issue 4, 2013, Retrieved February 27, 2016.</ref> was announced by the media. Immediately thereafter, Ceau\u0219escu presided over the CPEx (Political Executive Committee) meeting and assumed the leadership of the army.\nBelieving that Milea had been murdered, rank-and-file soldiers switched sides to the revolution almost ''en masse''.  The commanders wrote off Ceau\u0219escu as a lost cause and made no effort to keep their men loyal to the government. Ceau\u0219escu made a last desperate attempt to address the crowd gathered in front of the Central Committee building, but the people in the square began throwing stones and other projectiles at him, forcing him to take refuge in the building once more.  One group of protesters forced open the doors of the building, by now left unprotected.  They managed to overpower Ceau\u0219escu's bodyguards and rushed through his office and onto the balcony.  Although they did not know it, they were only a few metres from Ceau\u0219escu, who was trapped in an elevator.  He, Elena and four others managed to get to the roof and escape by helicopter, only seconds ahead of a group of demonstrators who had followed them there.<ref name=Revolution1989/> The [[Romanian Communist Party]] disappeared soon afterwards; unlike its kindred parties in the former Soviet bloc, it has never been revived.\n\nDuring the course of the revolution, the Western press{{who?|date=January 2020}} published estimates of the number of people killed by [[Securitate]] forces in an attempt to support Ceau\u0219escu and quell the rebellion{{fact?|date=January 2020}}.

They abandoned the helicopter near T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, having been ordered to land by the army, which by that time had restricted flying in Romania's airspace.

This can be explained by the largely crude and [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]] character of the dogma. Ceau\u0219escu attempted to [[Revisionism (Marxism)|include his views]] in mainstream [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, to which he added his belief in a \"multilaterally developed Socialist society\" as a necessary stage between the [[Marxism-Leninism|Leninist]] concepts of [[Socialist mode of production|Socialist]] and [[Communist society|Communist societies]] (a critical view reveals that the main reason for the interval is the [[Withering away of the state|disappearance of the State]] and Party structures in Communism). A Romanian Encyclopedic Dictionary entry in 1978 underlines the concept as \"a new, superior, stage in the Socialist development of Romania [...] begun by the 1971\u20131975 Five-Year Plan, prolonged over several [succeeding and projected] Five-Year Plans\".<ref>''Mic Dic\u021bionar Enciclopedic''</ref>\n\nCeau\u0219ism's main trait was a form of [[Romanian nationalism]],<ref>Geran Pilon, Chapter III, ''Communism with a Nationalist Face'', pp. 60\u201366; T\u0103nase, p. 24</ref> one which arguably propelled Ceau\u0219escu to power in 1965, and probably accounted for the Party leadership under [[Ion Gheorghe Maurer]] choosing him over the more orthodox [[Gheorghe Apostol]]. Although he had previously been a careful supporter of the official lines, Ceau\u0219escu came to embody Romanian society's wish for independence after what many considered years of Soviet directives and purges, during and after the [[SovRom]] fiasco. He carried this nationalist option inside the Party, manipulating it against the nominated successor Apostol. This nationalist policy had more timid precedents:<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Geran Pilon, p.60</ref> for example, Gheorghiu-Dej had overseen the withdrawal of the [[Red Army]] in 1958.\n\n[[File:Moldovan workers during Ceausescu visit (1972).

In the final years of Gheorghiu-Dej's rule, more problems were openly discussed, with the publication of a collection of [[Karl Marx]]'s writings that dealt with Romanian topics, showing Marx's previously censored, politically uncomfortable views of Russia.\n\nCeau\u0219escu was prepared to take a more decisive step in questioning Soviet policies. In the early years of his rule, he generally relaxed political pressures inside Romanian society,<ref>T\u0103nase, p.23</ref> which led to the late 1960s and early 1970s being the most liberal decade in Socialist Romania. Gaining the public's confidence, Ceau\u0219escu took a clear stand against the 1968 crushing of the [[Prague Spring]] by [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. After a visit from [[Charles de Gaulle]] earlier in the same year, during which the French President gave recognition to the incipient maverick, Ceau\u0219escu's public speech in August deeply impressed the population, not only through its themes, but also because, uniquely, it was unscripted. He immediately attracted Western sympathies and backing, which lasted well beyond the 'liberal' phase of his rule; at the same time, the period brought forward the threat of armed Soviet invasion: significantly, many young men inside Romania joined the ''[[Patriotic Guards (Romania)|Patriotic Guards]]'' created on the spur of the moment, in order to meet the perceived threat.<ref>Geran Pilon, p.62</ref> President Richard Nixon was invited to Bucharest in 1969, which was the first visit of a United States president to a communist country after the start of the Cold War.\n\n[[Alexander Dub\u010dek]]'s version of ''[[Socialism with a human face]]'' was never suited to Romanian Communist goals. Ceau\u0219escu found himself briefly aligned with Dub\u010dek's [[Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The latter friendship was to last until Tito's death in 1980, with Ceau\u0219escu adapting the [[Titoism|Titoist]] doctrine of \"independent Socialist development\" to suit his own objectives. Romania proclaimed itself a \"Socialist\" (in place of \"People's\") Republic to show that it was fulfilling Marxist goals without Moscow's oversight.\n\nThe system's nationalist traits grew and progressively blended with [[North Korea]]n ''[[Juche]]'' and [[China|Chinese]] [[Maoism|Maoist]] ideals. In 1971, the Party, which had already been completely purged of internal opposition (with the possible exception of [[Gheorghe Gaston Marin]]),<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> approved the ''[[July Theses]]'', expressing Ceau\u0219escu's disdain of Western models as a whole, and the reevaluation of the recent liberalisation as ''[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]''. The 1974 XIth Party Congress tightened the Party's grip on Romanian culture, guiding it towards Ceau\u0219escu's nationalist principles.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Geran Pilon, p.61</ref> Notably, it demanded that Romanian historians refer to [[Dacians]] as having \"an unorganised State\", part of a political continuum that culminated in the Socialist Republic.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> The government continued its cultural dialogue with ancient forms, with Ceau\u0219escu connecting his cult of personality to figures such as [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n]] (lit. \"Mircea the Elder\", whom he styled \"Mircea the Great\") and [[Mihai Viteazul]] (Michael the Brave). It also started adding Dacian or [[Imperial Rome|Roman]] versions to the names of cities and towns (''Drobeta'' to [[Turnu Severin]], ''Napoca'' to [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]]).<ref>Geran Pilon, pp. 61\u201363</ref> Although Ceau\u0219escu maintained an independent, \"national Communist\" course, his absolute control over the country, as well as the intensity of the personality cult surrounding him, led many non-Romanian observers to describe his rule as one of the closest things to an old-style Stalinist regime. The last edition of the [[Country Studies|Country Study]] on Romania, for instance, referred to the PCR's \"Stalinist repression of individual liberties.\"<ref>http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+ro0010%29</ref> A new generation of committed supporters on the outside confirmed the administration's character. Ceau\u0219escu probably never emphasized that his policies constituted a paradigm for theorists of [[National Bolshevism]] such as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Thiriart]], but there was a publicised connection between him and [[Iosif Constantin Dr\u0103gan]], an [[Iron Guard]]ist Romanian-Italian \u00e9migr\u00e9 millionaire (Dr\u0103gan was already committed to a Dacian [[Protochronism]] that largely echoed the official cultural policy).\n\nNicolae Ceau\u0219escu had a major influence on modern-day Romanian populist rhetoric. In his final years, he had begun to rehabilitate the image of pro-[[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] dictator [[Ion Antonescu]]. Although Antonescu's image was never a fully official myth in Ceau\u0219escu's time, today's politicians such as [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]] have coupled the images of the two leaders into their versions of a national Pantheon. The conflict with Hungary over the treatment of the [[Hungarian minority in Romania|Magyar minority]] in Romania had several unusual aspects: not only was it a vitriolic argument between two officially [[Socialist state]]s, it also marked the moment when Hungary, a state behind the [[Iron Curtain]], appealed to the [[Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] for sanctions to be taken against Romania. This meant that the later 1980s were marked by a pronounced anti-Hungarian discourse, which owed more to nationalist tradition than to Marxism,<ref>Geran Pilon, p.63</ref> and the ultimate isolation of Romania on the world stage.\n\nThe strong opposition to Ceau\u0219escu on all forms of ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'' placed Ceau\u0219escu at odds with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. He was very displeased when other Warsaw Pact countries decided to try their own versions of Gorbachev's reforms. In particular, he was incensed when [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]]'s leaders opted for a power-sharing arrangement with the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] trade union. He even went as far as to call for a Warsaw Pact invasion of Poland\u2014a significant reversal, considering how violently he opposed the invasion of Czechoslovakia 20 years earlier. For his part, Gorbachev made no secret of his distaste for Ceau\u0219escu, whom he called \"the Romanian [[f\u00fchrer]].\" At a meeting between the two, Gorbachev upbraided Ceau\u0219escu for his inflexible attitude. \"You are running a dictatorship here,\" the Soviet leader warned.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nIn November 1989, at the XIVth and last congress of the PCR, Ceau\u0219escu condemned the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] and asked for the annulment of its consequences. In effect, this amounted to a demand for the return of Bessarabia (most of which was then a Soviet republic and since 1991 has been independent [[Moldova]]) and northern [[Bukovina]], both of which had been [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupied by the Soviet Union]] in 1940 and again at the end of World War II.\n\n===Non-aligned policy feats===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0529-029, Berlin, Tagung Warschauer Pakt, Gruppenfoto.jpg|thumb|[[Warsaw Pact]] leaders in 1987 from left to right: [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k|Hus\u00e1k]] of [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Todor Zhivkov|Zhivkov]] of [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Erich Honecker|Honecker]] of [[East Germany]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] of the [[Soviet Union]], Ceau\u0219escu, [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski]] of [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r|K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] of [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]]]]\n\nCeau\u0219escu's Romania was the only Eastern Bloc country that retained diplomatic relations with Israel and did not sever diplomatic relations after Israel's pre-emptive strike against [[Egypt]] at the start of the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. Ceau\u0219escu made efforts to act as a mediator between the [[PLO]] and [[Israel]].\n\nSimilarly, Romania was the only Eastern Bloc country to attend the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], which had been [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotted]] by the Soviets and the rest of their allies in response to the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led boycott]] of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow.\n\nCeau\u0219escu's Romania was the only [[Warsaw Pact]] country that did not sever diplomatic relations with [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u201390)|Chile]] after [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|Augusto Pinochet's coup]].<ref>Valenzuela, J.

Relations were in fact not just state-to-state, but party-to-party between their respective [[One-party state|political machineries]], the [[Popular Movement of the Revolution|MPR]] and the [[Romanian Communist Party|PCR]].

In December 1976, at one of his meetings in Bucharest, [[Ivan Bodiul]] said that \"the good relationship was initiated by Ceau\u0219escu's visit to Soviet Moldova\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/53-1-68.shtml|title=Romanian-Moldavian SSR relations, by Patrick Moore and the Romanian Section|publisher=}}</ref> The final volumes of the official ''History of Romania'' alluded to an unlawful Soviet presence in Bessarabia.\n\n===Personality cult and totalitarianism===\n[[File:TimbruNicolaeCeausescu.png|thumb|Stamp commemorating the 70th birthday (and 55 years of political activity) of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, 1988]]\n{{main|Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu's cult of personality}}\nCeau\u0219escu created a pervasive [[Cult of personality|personality cult]], giving himself such titles as \"[[Conduc\u0103tor]]\" (\"Leader\") and \"Geniul din Carpa\u021bi\" (\"The Genius of the Carpathians\"), with inspiration from [[Proletarian Culture]] ([[Proletkult]]). After his election as President of Romania, he even had a [[Kings of Romania|king]]-like [[sceptre]] made for himself.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=September 2019}} \n\nThe most important day of the year during Ceau\u0219escu's rule was his birthday, 26 January \u2013 a day which saw Romanian media saturated with praise for him. According to historian [[Victor Sebestyen]], it was one of the few days of the year when the average Romanian put on a happy face, since appearing miserable on this day was too risky to contemplate.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nSuch excesses prompted painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] to send a congratulatory telegram to the Romanian president, in which he sarcastically congratulated Ceau\u0219escu on his \"introducing the presidential sceptre\". The Communist Party daily ''[[Sc\u00eenteia]]'' published the message, unaware that it was a work of satire. To lessen the chance of further treason after Pacepa's defection, Ceau\u0219escu also invested his wife Elena and other members of his family with important positions in the government. This led Romanians to joke that Ceau\u0219escu was creating \"[[socialism in one country|socialism in one family]]\".{{Cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nNot surprisingly, Ceau\u0219escu was greatly concerned about his public image. For years, nearly all official photographs of him showed him in his late 40s. Romanian state television was under strict orders to portray him in the best possible light.<ref name=Revolution1989/> Additionally, producers had to take great care to make sure that Ceau\u0219escu's height (he was only {{convert|1.68|m}} tall<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realitatea.net/un-ceausescu-pe-care-nu-il-stiati-cret-cu-ochii-blonzi-si-nasul-borcanat_858565.html|title=Un Ceau\u015fescu pe care nu \u00eel \u015ftia\u0163i: cre\u0163, cu ochii \"blonzi\" \u015fi nasul borc\u0103nat|language=Romanian|publisher=Realitatea.net|date=3 August 2011|accessdate=July 22, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726194246/http://www.realitatea.net/un-ceausescu-pe-care-nu-il-stiati-cret-cu-ochii-blonzi-si-nasul-borcanat_858565.html|archivedate=26 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>) was never emphasized on screen. Consequences for breaking these rules were severe; one producer showed footage of Ceau\u0219escu blinking and stuttering, and was banned for three months.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nAs part of a propaganda ploy arranged by the Ceau\u0219escus through the consular cultural attach\u00e9s of Romanian embassies, they managed to receive orders and titles from numerous states and institutions. France granted Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu the [[Legion of Honour]]. In 1978 he became a Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Bath]] (GCB) in the [[UK]],<ref>[[List of honorary British Knights]]</ref> a title of which he was stripped in 1989. Elena Ceau\u0219escu was arranged to be \"elected\" to membership of a science academy in the U.S.\n\nTo execute a massive redevelopment project during the rule of Nicolae Ceausescu, the government conducted extensive demolition of churches and many other historic structures in Romania. According to Alexandru Budistenu, former chief architect of Bucharest, \"The sight of a church bothered Ceausescu.  It didn't matter if they demolished or moved it, as long as it was no longer in sight.\" Nevertheless, a project organized by Romanian engineer Eugeniu Iordachescu was able to move many historic structures to less-prominent sites and save them.<ref>Smith, Harrison.
