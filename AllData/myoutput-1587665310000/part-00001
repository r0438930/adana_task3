The classical definition, described but not ultimately endorsed by [[Plato]],<ref>In Plato's ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', Socrates and Theaetetus discuss three definitions of ''knowledge'': knowledge as nothing but perception, knowledge as true judgment, and, finally, knowledge as a true judgment with an account. Each of these definitions is shown to be unsatisfactory.</ref> specifies that a [[statement (logic)|statement]] must meet three [[wikt:criterion|criteria]] in order to be considered knowledge: it must be [[theory of justification|justified]], [[truth|true]], and [[belief|believed]]. Some claim that these conditions are not sufficient, as [[Gettier case]] examples allegedly demonstrate. There are a number of alternatives proposed, including [[Robert Nozick]]'s arguments for a requirement that knowledge 'tracks the truth' and [[Simon Blackburn]]'s additional requirement that we do not want to say that those who meet any of these conditions 'through a defect, flaw, or failure' have knowledge. [[Richard Kirkham]] suggests that our definition of knowledge requires that the evidence for the belief necessitates its truth.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Does the Gettier Problem Rest on a Mistake? |first1=Richard L. |last1=Kirkham |journal=Mind |series=New Series |volume=93 |number=372 |date=October 1984 |pages=501\u2013513 |jstor=2254258 }} [[jstor]] {{subscription}}{{Dead link|date=November 2016}}<!-- the pdf link is the dead one --></ref>\n\nIn contrast to this approach, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] observed, following [[Moore's paradox]], that one can say \"He believes it, but it isn't so,\" but not \"He knows it, but it isn't so.\"<ref>Ludwig Wittgenstein, ''[[On Certainty]]'', remark 42</ref> He goes on to argue that these do not correspond to distinct mental states, but rather to distinct ways of talking about conviction. What is different here is not the mental state of the speaker, but the activity in which they are engaged. For example, on this account, to ''know'' that the kettle is boiling is not to be in a particular state of mind, but to perform a particular task with the statement that the kettle is boiling. Wittgenstein sought to bypass the difficulty of definition by looking to the way \"knowledge\" is used in natural languages. He saw knowledge as a case of a [[family resemblance]]. Following this idea, \"knowledge\" has been reconstructed as a cluster concept that points out relevant features but that is not adequately captured by any definition.<ref>Gottschalk-Mazouz, N.

Hence the transfer of the symbolic representation can be viewed as one [[wikt:ascription|ascription]] process whereby knowledge can be transferred. Other forms of communication include observation and imitation, verbal exchange, and audio and video recordings. Philosophers of language and [[semiotician]]s construct and analyze theories of knowledge transfer or communication.\n\nWhile many would agree that one of the most universal and significant tools for the transfer of knowledge is writing and reading (of many kinds), argument over the usefulness of the written word exists nonetheless, with some scholars skeptical of its impact on societies. In his collection of essays ''[[Technopoly: the Surrender of Culture to Technology|Technopoly]]'', [[Neil Postman]] demonstrates the argument against the use of writing through an excerpt from Plato's work ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' (Postman, Neil (1992) ''Technopoly'', Vintage, New York, p.&nbsp;73). In this excerpt, the scholar [[Socrates]] recounts the story of Thamus, the Egyptian king and Theuth the inventor of the written word. In this story, Theuth presents his new invention \"writing\" to King Thamus, telling Thamus that his new invention \"will improve both the [[wisdom]] and memory of the Egyptians\" (Postman, Neil (1992) Technopoly, Vintage, New York, p.&nbsp;74). King Thamus is skeptical of this new invention and rejects it as a tool of recollection rather than retained knowledge. He argues that the written word will infect the Egyptian people with fake knowledge as they will be able to attain facts and stories from an external source and will no longer be forced to mentally retain large quantities of knowledge themselves (Postman, Neil (1992) ''Technopoly'', Vintage, New York, p.&nbsp;74).\n\nClassical early modern theories of knowledge, especially those advancing the influential empiricism of the philosopher John Locke, were based implicitly or explicitly on a model of the mind which likened ideas to words.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hacking|first=Ian|title=Why Does Language Matter to Philosophy?|date=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/?id=07bB6_WfeUoC&dq=ian+hacking+language+philosophy|isbn=978-0521099981}}</ref> This analogy between language and thought laid the foundation for a graphic conception of knowledge in which the mind was treated as a table, a container of content, that had to be stocked with facts reduced to letters, numbers or symbols.

It was used by [[Donna Haraway]] as an extension of the [[Feminism|feminist]] approaches of \"successor science\" suggested by [[Sandra Harding]], one which \"offers a more adequate, richer, better account of a world, in order to live in it well and in critical, reflexive relation to our own as well as others' practices of domination and the unequal parts of privilege and oppression that makes up all positions.\"<ref name=\"Haraway1988\">\"[https://philpapers.org/archive/HARSKT.pdf Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective]\". Haraway, Donna. ''Feminist Studies'' Vol. 14, No. 3. pp. 575\u2013599. 1988.</ref> This situation partially transforms science into a [[narrative]], which [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]] explains as, \"neither fictions nor supposed facts.\" This narrative of situation is historical textures woven of fact and fiction, and as Escobar explains further, \"even the most neutral scientific domains are narratives in this sense,\" insisting that rather than a purpose dismissing science as a trivial matter of contingency, \"it is to treat (this narrative) in the most serious way, without succumbing to its mystification as 'the truth' or to the ironic [[skepticism]] common to many critiques.\"<ref>\"Introduction: Development and the Anthropology of Modernity\". Escobar, Arturo. ''Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World''.</ref>\n\nHaraway's argument stems from the limitations of the [[human perception]], as well as the overemphasis of the [[Visual perception|sense of vision]] in [[science]]. According to Haraway, [[Visual perception|vision]] in [[science]] has been, \"used to signify a leap out of the marked body and into a conquering gaze from nowhere.\" This is the \"gaze that mythically inscribes all the marked bodies, that makes the unmarked category claim the power to see and not be seen, to represent while escaping representation.\"<ref name=\"Haraway1988\" /> This causes a limitation of views in the position of [[science]] itself as a potential player in the creation of knowledge, resulting in a position of \"modest witness\". This is what Haraway terms a \"god trick\", or the aforementioned representation while escaping representation.<ref>Chapter 1. Haraway, Donna. ''Modest_Witness@Second_Millennium. FemaleMan\u00a9 Meets_OncoMouse2. Feminism and Technoscience''. 1997.</ref> In order to avoid this, \"Haraway perpetuates a tradition of thought which emphasizes the importance of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] in terms of both ethical and political accountability\".<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0263276406069232| title=Posthuman, All Too Human| journal=Theory, Culture & Society| volume=23| issue=7\u20138| pages=197\u2013208| year=2006| last1=Braidotti| first1=Rosi| doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nSome methods of generating knowledge, such as [[trial and error]], or learning from [[experience]], tend to create highly situational knowledge.\nSituational knowledge is often embedded in language, culture, or traditions.

Fundamentally, both argue the [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]] of knowledge on the presence of [[history]]; [[Power (social and political)|power]], and [[geography]], as well as the rejection of universal rules or laws or elementary structures; and the idea of [[Power (social and political)|power]] as an inherited trait of [[objectification]].<ref>\"The Subject and Power\".

In most cases, it is not possible to understand an information domain exhaustively; our knowledge is always ''incomplete'' or partial. Most real problems have to be solved by taking advantage of a partial understanding of the problem context and problem data, unlike the typical math problems one might solve at school, where all data is given and one is given a complete understanding of formulas necessary to solve them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nThis idea is also present in the concept of [[bounded rationality]] which assumes that in real life situations people often have a limited amount of information and make decisions accordingly.\n\n== Scientific knowledge ==\n[[File:Francis Bacon 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Sir Francis Bacon]], \"[[Scientia potentia est|Knowledge is Power]]\"]]\nThe development of the [[scientific method]] has made a significant contribution to how knowledge of the physical world and its phenomena is acquired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/science|title=Science \u2013 Definition of science by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}</ref> To be termed scientific, a method of [[inquiry]] must be based on gathering [[observable]] and [[Measurement|measurable]] [[evidence]] subject to specific principles of [[reasoning]] and experimentation.<ref>\"[4] Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]\", {{harvnb|Newton|1999|pp=794\u2013796}}, from the [[General Scholium]], which follows Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.</ref> The scientific method consists of the collection of [[data]] through [[observation]] and [[experiment]]ation, and the formulation and testing of [[hypotheses]].<ref>[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/scientific%20method scientific method], ''[[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary''.</ref> Science, and the nature of scientific knowledge have also become the subject of [[Philosophy of science|philosophy]].

Note that \"[[epistemology]]\" is the study of knowledge and how it is acquired. Science is \"the process used everyday to logically complete thoughts through inference of facts determined by calculated experiments.\" [[Sir Francis Bacon]] was critical in the historical development of the scientific method; his works established and popularized an inductive methodology for scientific inquiry. His famous aphorism, \"[[Scientia potentia est|knowledge is power]]\", is found in the Meditations Sacrae (1597).<ref>{{cite web\n| title       = Sir Francis Bacon \u2013 Quotationspage.com\n| url         = http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/2060.html\n| accessdate  = 2009-07-08}}</ref>\n\nUntil recent times, at least in the Western tradition, it was simply taken for granted that knowledge was something possessed only by humans \u2013 and probably ''adult'' humans at that. Sometimes the notion might stretch to ''Society-as-such'', as in (e.&nbsp;g.) \"the knowledge possessed by the Coptic culture\" (as opposed to its individual members), but that was not assured either. Nor was it usual to consider ''unconscious'' knowledge in any systematic way until this approach was popularized by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].<ref>There is quite a good case for this exclusive specialization used by philosophers, in that it allows for in-depth study of logic-procedures and other abstractions which are not found elsewhere. However this may lead to problems whenever the topic spills over into those excluded domains \u2013 e.&nbsp;g. when Kant (following Newton) dismissed ''Space and Time'' as axiomatically \"transcendental\" and \"a priori\" \u2013 a claim later disproved by [[Jean Piaget|Piaget's]] clinical studies. It also seems likely that the vexed problem of \"''[[infinite regress]]''\" can be largely (but not completely) solved by proper attention to how unconscious concepts are ''actually'' developed, both during infantile learning ''and'' as inherited \"pseudo-transcendentals\" inherited from the trial-and-error of previous generations.

See the list of four \"epistemological domains\": [[Karl Popper|Popper]], (1975);<ref>[[Karl Popper|Popper, K.R.]] (1975). \"The rationality of scientific revolutions\"; in Rom Harr\u00e9 (ed.), ''Problems of Scientific Revolution: Scientific Progress and Obstacles to Progress in the Sciences''.

For biologists, knowledge must be usefully ''available'' to the system, though that system need not be conscious. Thus the criteria seem to be:\n* The system should apparently be dynamic and self-organizing (unlike a mere book ''on its own'').\n* The knowledge must constitute some sort of representation of \"the outside world\",<ref>This \"outside world\" could include other subsystems within the same organism \u2013 e.&nbsp;g. different \"mental levels\" corresponding to different Piagetian stages. See [[Theory of cognitive development]].</ref> or ways of dealing with it (directly or indirectly).\n* Some way must exist for the system to access this information quickly enough for it to be useful.\n\nScientific knowledge may not involve a claim to [[certainty]], maintaining [[skepticism]] means that a scientist will never be absolutely certain when they are correct and when they are not. It is thus an irony of proper [[scientific method]] that one must doubt even when correct, in the hopes that this practice will lead to greater convergence on the [[truth]] in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philosophybites.com/2007/12/barry-stroud-on.html|title=philosophy bites|work=philosophybites.com}}</ref>\n\n== Religious meaning of knowledge ==\nIn many expressions of [[Christianity]], such as [[Catholicism]] and [[Anglicanism]], knowledge is one of the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a7.htm#1831\n|title=Part Three, No. 1831\n|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church\n|accessdate=2007-04-20\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504201314/http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a7.htm#1804#1831\n|archivedate=2007-05-04\n|df=\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Old Testament]]'s [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] contained the knowledge that separated Man from God: \"And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil...\" ({{bibleverse||Genesis|3:22|KJV}})\n\nIn [[Gnosticism]], divine knowledge or [[gnosis]] is hoped to be attained.\n\n\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u093e\u0928 (Vidya Daan) i.e. [[knowledge sharing]] is a major part of [[D\u0101na|Daan]], a [[Niyama|tenet]] of all [[Indian religions|Dharmic Religions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vhp.org/news/news-regional/delhi-seva|title=\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0940 \u0938\u092c\u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0921\u093e \u0926\u093e\u0928 : \u0935\u093f\u0939\u093f\u092a \u2013 Vishva Hindu Parishad \u2013 Official Website|work=vhp.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820205238/http://vhp.org/news/news-regional/delhi-seva|archivedate=2011-08-20|df=}}</ref>\n[[Hindu]] Scriptures present two kinds of knowledge, ''Paroksh Gyan'' and ''Prataksh Gyan''.

Without this idea of a \"theory of knowledge,\" it is hard to imagine what \"philosophy\" could have been in the age of modern science.|[[Richard Rorty]]|''[[Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature]]''}}\n\nThe definition of knowledge is a matter of ongoing [[debate]] among [[philosopher]]s in the field of [[epistemology]]. The classical definition, described but not ultimately endorsed by [[Plato]],<ref>In Plato's ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', Socrates and Theaetetus discuss three definitions of ''knowledge'': knowledge as nothing but perception, knowledge as true judgment, and, finally, knowledge as a true judgment with an account. Each of these definitions is shown to be unsatisfactory.</ref> specifies that a [[statement (logic)|statement]] must meet three [[wikt:criterion|criteria]] in order to be considered knowledge: it must be [[theory of justification|justified]], [[truth|true]], and [[belief|believed]]. Some claim that these conditions are not sufficient, as [[Gettier case]] examples allegedly demonstrate. There are a number of alternatives proposed, including [[Robert Nozick]]'s arguments for a requirement that knowledge 'tracks the truth' and [[Simon Blackburn]]'s additional requirement that we do not want to say that those who meet any of these conditions 'through a defect, flaw, or failure' have knowledge. [[Richard Kirkham]] suggests that our definition of knowledge requires that the evidence for the belief necessitates its truth.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Does the Gettier Problem Rest on a Mistake? |first1=Richard L. |last1=Kirkham |journal=Mind |series=New Series |volume=93 |number=372 |date=October 1984 |pages=501\u2013513 |jstor=2254258 }} [[jstor]] {{subscription}}{{Dead link|date=November 2016}}<!-- the pdf link is the dead one --></ref>\n\nIn contrast to this approach, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] observed, following [[Moore's paradox]], that one can say \"He believes it, but it isn't so,\" but not \"He knows it, but it isn't so.\"<ref>Ludwig Wittgenstein, ''[[On Certainty]]'', remark 42</ref> He goes on to argue that these do not correspond to distinct mental states, but rather to distinct ways of talking about conviction. What is different here is not the mental state of the speaker, but the activity in which they are engaged. For example, on this account, to ''know'' that the kettle is boiling is not to be in a particular state of mind, but to perform a particular task with the statement that the kettle is boiling. Wittgenstein sought to bypass the difficulty of definition by looking to the way \"knowledge\" is used in natural languages. He saw knowledge as a case of a [[family resemblance]]. Following this idea, \"knowledge\" has been reconstructed as a cluster concept that points out relevant features but that is not adequately captured by any definition.<ref>Gottschalk-Mazouz, N.

Hence the transfer of the symbolic representation can be viewed as one [[wikt:ascription|ascription]] process whereby knowledge can be transferred. Other forms of communication include observation and imitation, verbal exchange, and audio and video recordings. Philosophers of language and [[semiotician]]s construct and analyze theories of knowledge transfer or communication.\n\nWhile many would agree that one of the most universal and significant tools for the transfer of knowledge is writing and reading (of many kinds), argument over the usefulness of the written word exists nonetheless, with some scholars skeptical of its impact on societies. In his collection of essays ''[[Technopoly: the Surrender of Culture to Technology|Technopoly]]'', [[Neil Postman]] demonstrates the argument against the use of writing through an excerpt from Plato's work ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' (Postman, Neil (1992) ''Technopoly'', Vintage, New York, p.&nbsp;73). In this excerpt, the scholar [[Socrates]] recounts the story of Thamus, the Egyptian king and Theuth the inventor of the written word. In this story, Theuth presents his new invention \"writing\" to King Thamus, telling Thamus that his new invention \"will improve both the [[wisdom]] and memory of the Egyptians\" (Postman, Neil (1992) Technopoly, Vintage, New York, p.&nbsp;74). King Thamus is skeptical of this new invention and rejects it as a tool of recollection rather than retained knowledge. He argues that the written word will infect the Egyptian people with fake knowledge as they will be able to attain facts and stories from an external source and will no longer be forced to mentally retain large quantities of knowledge themselves (Postman, Neil (1992) ''Technopoly'', Vintage, New York, p.&nbsp;74).\n\nClassical early modern theories of knowledge, especially those advancing the influential empiricism of the philosopher John Locke, were based implicitly or explicitly on a model of the mind which likened ideas to words.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hacking|first=Ian|title=Why Does Language Matter to Philosophy?|date=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/?id=07bB6_WfeUoC&dq=ian+hacking+language+philosophy|isbn=978-0521099981}}</ref> This analogy between language and thought laid the foundation for a graphic conception of knowledge in which the mind was treated as a table, a container of content, that had to be stocked with facts reduced to letters, numbers or symbols.

It is only recently that audio and video technology for recording knowledge have become available and the use of these still requires replay equipment and electricity. Verbal teaching and handing down of knowledge is limited to those who would have contact with the transmitter or someone who could interpret written work.

It was used by [[Donna Haraway]] as an extension of the [[Feminism|feminist]] approaches of \"successor science\" suggested by [[Sandra Harding]], one which \"offers a more adequate, richer, better account of a world, in order to live in it well and in critical, reflexive relation to our own as well as others' practices of domination and the unequal parts of privilege and oppression that makes up all positions.\"<ref name=\"Haraway1988\">\"[https://philpapers.org/archive/HARSKT.pdf Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective]\". Haraway, Donna. ''Feminist Studies'' Vol. 14, No. 3. pp. 575\u2013599. 1988.</ref> This situation partially transforms science into a [[narrative]], which [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]] explains as, \"neither fictions nor supposed facts.\" This narrative of situation is historical textures woven of fact and fiction, and as Escobar explains further, \"even the most neutral scientific domains are narratives in this sense,\" insisting that rather than a purpose dismissing science as a trivial matter of contingency, \"it is to treat (this narrative) in the most serious way, without succumbing to its mystification as 'the truth' or to the ironic [[skepticism]] common to many critiques.\"<ref>\"Introduction: Development and the Anthropology of Modernity\". Escobar, Arturo. ''Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World''.</ref>\n\nHaraway's argument stems from the limitations of the [[human perception]], as well as the overemphasis of the [[Visual perception|sense of vision]] in [[science]]. According to Haraway, [[Visual perception|vision]] in [[science]] has been, \"used to signify a leap out of the marked body and into a conquering gaze from nowhere.\" This is the \"gaze that mythically inscribes all the marked bodies, that makes the unmarked category claim the power to see and not be seen, to represent while escaping representation.\"<ref name=\"Haraway1988\" /> This causes a limitation of views in the position of [[science]] itself as a potential player in the creation of knowledge, resulting in a position of \"modest witness\". This is what Haraway terms a \"god trick\", or the aforementioned representation while escaping representation.<ref>Chapter 1. Haraway, Donna. ''Modest_Witness@Second_Millennium. FemaleMan\u00a9 Meets_OncoMouse2. Feminism and Technoscience''. 1997.</ref> In order to avoid this, \"Haraway perpetuates a tradition of thought which emphasizes the importance of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] in terms of both ethical and political accountability\".<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0263276406069232| title=Posthuman, All Too Human| journal=Theory, Culture & Society| volume=23| issue=7\u20138| pages=197\u2013208| year=2006| last1=Braidotti| first1=Rosi| doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nSome methods of generating knowledge, such as [[trial and error]], or learning from [[experience]], tend to create highly situational knowledge.\nSituational knowledge is often embedded in language, culture, or traditions. This integration of situational knowledge is an allusion to the community, and its attempts at collecting subjective perspectives into an embodiment \"of views from somewhere.\" <ref name=\"Haraway1988\" />\n\nEven though Haraway's arguments are largely based on [[Feminism|feminist studies]],<ref name=\"Haraway1988\" /> this idea of different worlds, as well as the [[Skepticism|skeptic]] stance of situated knowledge is present in the main arguments of [[post-structuralism]]. Fundamentally, both argue the [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]] of knowledge on the presence of [[history]]; [[Power (social and political)|power]], and [[geography]], as well as the rejection of universal rules or laws or elementary structures; and the idea of [[Power (social and political)|power]] as an inherited trait of [[objectification]].<ref>\"The Subject and Power\".

In most cases, it is not possible to understand an information domain exhaustively; our knowledge is always ''incomplete'' or partial. Most real problems have to be solved by taking advantage of a partial understanding of the problem context and problem data, unlike the typical math problems one might solve at school, where all data is given and one is given a complete understanding of formulas necessary to solve them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nThis idea is also present in the concept of [[bounded rationality]] which assumes that in real life situations people often have a limited amount of information and make decisions accordingly.\n\n== Scientific knowledge ==\n[[File:Francis Bacon 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Sir Francis Bacon]], \"[[Scientia potentia est|Knowledge is Power]]\"]]\nThe development of the [[scientific method]] has made a significant contribution to how knowledge of the physical world and its phenomena is acquired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/science|title=Science \u2013 Definition of science by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}</ref> To be termed scientific, a method of [[inquiry]] must be based on gathering [[observable]] and [[Measurement|measurable]] [[evidence]] subject to specific principles of [[reasoning]] and experimentation.<ref>\"[4] Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]\", {{harvnb|Newton|1999|pp=794\u2013796}}, from the [[General Scholium]], which follows Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.</ref> The scientific method consists of the collection of [[data]] through [[observation]] and [[experiment]]ation, and the formulation and testing of [[hypotheses]].<ref>[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/scientific%20method scientific method], ''[[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary''.</ref> Science, and the nature of scientific knowledge have also become the subject of [[Philosophy of science|Philosophy]].

Note that \"[[epistemology]]\" is the study of knowledge and how it is acquired. Science is \"the process used everyday to logically complete thoughts through inference of facts determined by calculated experiments.\" [[Sir Francis Bacon]] was critical in the historical development of the scientific method; his works established and popularized an inductive methodology for scientific inquiry. His famous aphorism, \"[[Scientia potentia est|knowledge is power]]\", is found in the Meditations Sacrae (1597).<ref>{{cite web\n| title       = Sir Francis Bacon \u2013 Quotationspage.com\n| url         = http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/2060.html\n| accessdate  = 2009-07-08}}</ref>\n\nUntil recent times, at least in the Western tradition, it was simply taken for granted that knowledge was something possessed only by humans \u2013 and probably ''adult'' humans at that. Sometimes the notion might stretch to ''Society-as-such'', as in (e.&nbsp;g.) \"the knowledge possessed by the Coptic culture\" (as opposed to its individual members), but that was not assured either. Nor was it usual to consider ''unconscious'' knowledge in any systematic way until this approach was popularized by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].<ref>There is quite a good case for this exclusive specialization used by philosophers, in that it allows for in-depth study of logic-procedures and other abstractions which are not found elsewhere. However this may lead to problems whenever the topic spills over into those excluded domains \u2013 e.&nbsp;g. when Kant (following Newton) dismissed ''Space and Time'' as axiomatically \"transcendental\" and \"a priori\" \u2013 a claim later disproved by [[Jean Piaget|Piaget's]] clinical studies. It also seems likely that the vexed problem of \"''[[infinite regress]]''\" can be largely (but not completely) solved by proper attention to how unconscious concepts are ''actually'' developed, both during infantile learning ''and'' as inherited \"pseudo-transcendentals\" inherited from the trial-and-error of previous generations.

Inhelder (1948/1956). ''The child's conception of space''. Routledge & Kegan Paul: London.</ref>\n\nOther biological domains where \"knowledge\" might be said to reside, include: (iii) the ''immune system'', and (iv) in the ''DNA of the genetic code''. See the list of four \"epistemological domains\": [[Karl Popper|Popper]], (1975);<ref>[[Karl Popper|Popper, K.R.]] (1975). \"The rationality of scientific revolutions\"; in Rom Harr\u00e9 (ed.), ''Problems of Scientific Revolution: Scientific Progress and Obstacles to Progress in the Sciences''.

For biologists, knowledge must be usefully ''available'' to the system, though that system need not be conscious. Thus the criteria seem to be:\n* The system should apparently be dynamic and self-organizing (unlike a mere book ''on its own'').\n* The knowledge must constitute some sort of representation of \"the outside world\",<ref>This \"outside world\" could include other subsystems within the same organism \u2013 e.&nbsp;g. different \"mental levels\" corresponding to different Piagetian stages. See [[Theory of cognitive development]].</ref> or ways of dealing with it (directly or indirectly).\n* Some way must exist for the system to access this information quickly enough for it to be useful.\n\nScientific knowledge may not involve a claim to [[certainty]], maintaining [[skepticism]] means that a scientist will never be absolutely certain when they are correct and when they are not. It is thus an irony of proper [[scientific method]] that one must doubt even when correct, in the hopes that this practice will lead to greater convergence on the [[truth]] in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philosophybites.com/2007/12/barry-stroud-on.html|title=philosophy bites|work=philosophybites.com}}</ref>\n\n== Religious meaning of knowledge ==\nIn many expressions of [[Christianity]], such as [[Catholicism]] and [[Anglicanism]], knowledge is one of the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a7.htm#1831\n|title=Part Three, No. 1831\n|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church\n|accessdate=2007-04-20\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504201314/http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a7.htm#1804#1831\n|archivedate=2007-05-04\n|df=\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Old Testament]]'s [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] contained the knowledge that separated Man from God: \"And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil...\" ({{bibleverse||Genesis|3:22|KJV}})\n\nIn [[Gnosticism]], divine knowledge or [[gnosis]] is hoped to be attained.\n\n\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u093e\u0928 (Vidya Daan) i.e. [[knowledge sharing]] is a major part of [[D\u0101na|Daan]], a [[Niyama|tenet]] of all [[Indian religions|Dharmic Religions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vhp.org/news/news-regional/delhi-seva|title=\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0940 \u0938\u092c\u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0921\u093e \u0926\u093e\u0928 : \u0935\u093f\u0939\u093f\u092a \u2013 Vishva Hindu Parishad \u2013 Official Website|work=vhp.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820205238/http://vhp.org/news/news-regional/delhi-seva|archivedate=2011-08-20|df=}}</ref>\n[[Hindu]] Scriptures present two kinds of knowledge, ''Paroksh Gyan'' and ''Prataksh Gyan''.
