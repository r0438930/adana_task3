Lake Bonneville was a pluvial lake in the sense that it formed in response to an increase in precipitation and a decrease in evaporation as a result of cooler temperatures. Lake Bonneville covered much of what is now western Utah and at its highest level extended into present-day Idaho and Nevada. Many other hydrographically closed basins in the Great Basin contained expanded lakes during the Late Pleistocene, including Lake Lahontan in northwestern Nevada.\n\n==Geologic description==\n[[File:Lake bonneville map.svg|thumb|Lake Bonneville and other ice age [[pluvial]] lakes (17,500 years before the present), and modern remnants]]\nShorelines of Lake Bonneville are visible above Salt Lake City along the western front of the Wasatch Mountains and on other mountains throughout the Bonneville basin.<ref name=\":0\">Gilbert, G.K., 1890.

Lake Bonneville was a pluvial lake in the sense that it formed in response to an increase in precipitation and a decrease in evaporation as a result of cooler temperatures. Lake Bonneville covered much of what is now western Utah and at its highest level extended into present-day Idaho and Nevada. Many other hydrographically closed basins in the Great Basin contained expanded lakes during the Late Pleistocene, including Lake Lahontan in northwestern Nevada.\n\n==Geologic description==\n[[File:Lake bonneville map.svg|thumb|Lake Bonneville and other ice age [[pluvial]] lakes (17,500 years before the present), and modern remnants]]\nShorelines of Lake Bonneville are visible above Salt Lake City along the western front of the Wasatch Mountains and on other mountains throughout the Bonneville basin.<ref name=\":0\">Gilbert, G.K., 1890.
