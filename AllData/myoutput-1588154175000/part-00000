He was also closely associated with the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic|Liverpool Philharmonic]] and [[The Hall\u00e9|Hall\u00e9]] orchestras. From the early 20th century until his death, Beecham was a major influence on the musical life of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and, according to the [[BBC]], was Britain's first international conductor.\n\nBorn to a rich industrial family, Beecham began his career as a conductor in 1899. He used his access to the family fortune to finance opera from the 1910s until the start of the Second World War, staging seasons at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] and [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]] with international stars, his own orchestra and a wide repertoire. Among the works he introduced to England were [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' and ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and three operas by [[Frederick Delius]].\n\nTogether with his younger colleague [[Malcolm Sargent]], Beecham founded the London Philharmonic, and he conducted its first performance at the [[Queen's Hall]] in 1932. In the 1940s he worked for three years in the United States where he was music director of the [[Seattle Symphony]] and conducted at the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. After his return to Britain, he founded the Royal Philharmonic in 1946 and conducted it until his death in 1961.\n\nBeecham's repertoire was eclectic, sometimes favouring lesser-known composers over famous ones. His specialities included composers whose works were neglected in Britain before he became their advocate, such as Delius and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. Other composers with whose music he was frequently associated were [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] and the composer he revered above all others, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:BeechamsBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|alt=exterior of nineteenth century industrial building|The Beecham factory in St Helens]]\nBeecham was born in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]], Lancashire (now Merseyside), in a house adjoining the [[Beecham's Pills]] laxative factory founded by his grandfather, [[Thomas Beecham (chemist)|Thomas Beecham]].<ref name=reid19>Reid, p. 19</ref> His parents were [[Sir Joseph Beecham, 1st Baronet|Joseph Beecham]], the elder son of Thomas, and Josephine, ''n\u00e9e'' Burnett.<ref name=reid19/> He was an uncle of poet [[Audrey Beecham]].

As a result of his estrangement from his father between 1899 and 1909, his access to the Beecham family fortune was strictly limited. From 1907 he had an annuity of \u00a3700 left to him in his grandfather's will, and his mother subsidised some of his loss-making concerts,<ref name=reid62>Reid, p. 62</ref> but it was not until father and son were reconciled in 1909 that Beecham was able to draw on the family fortune to promote opera.<ref>Reid, p. 88</ref>\n\n===1910\u20131920===\nFrom 1910, subsidised by his father, Beecham realised his ambition to mount opera seasons at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] and other houses.

in 1948]]\n'''Sir Thomas Beecham, 2nd Baronet''', [[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]] (29 April 1879{{spaced ndash}}8 March 1961) was an English conductor and [[impresario]] best known for his association with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra|London Philharmonic]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra|Royal Philharmonic]] orchestras. He was also closely associated with the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic|Liverpool Philharmonic]] and [[The Hall\u00e9|Hall\u00e9]] orchestras. From the early 20th century until his death, Beecham was a major influence on the musical life of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and, according to the [[BBC]], was Britain's first international conductor.\n\nBorn to a rich industrial family, Beecham began his career as a conductor in 1899. He used his access to the family fortune to finance opera from the 1910s until the start of the Second World War, staging seasons at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] and [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]] with international stars, his own orchestra and a wide repertoire. Among the works he introduced to England were [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' and ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and three operas by [[Frederick Delius]].\n\nTogether with his younger colleague [[Malcolm Sargent]], Beecham founded the London Philharmonic, and he conducted its first performance at the [[Queen's Hall]] in 1932. In the 1940s he worked for three years in the United States where he was music director of the [[Seattle Symphony]] and conducted at the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. After his return to Britain, he founded the Royal Philharmonic in 1946 and conducted it until his death in 1961.\n\nBeecham's repertoire was eclectic, sometimes favouring lesser-known composers over famous ones. His specialities included composers whose works were neglected in Britain before he became their advocate, such as Delius and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. Other composers with whose music he was frequently associated were [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] and the composer he revered above all others, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:BeechamsBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|alt=exterior of nineteenth century industrial building|The Beecham factory in St Helens]]\nBeecham was born in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]], Lancashire (now Merseyside), in a house adjoining the [[Beecham's Pills]] laxative factory founded by his grandfather, [[Thomas Beecham (chemist)|Thomas Beecham]].<ref name=reid19>Reid, p. 19</ref> His parents were [[Sir Joseph Beecham, 1st Baronet|Joseph Beecham]], the elder son of Thomas, and Josephine, ''n\u00e9e'' Burnett.<ref name=reid19/> He was an uncle of poet [[Audrey Beecham]].

In his early discussions with his new orchestra, he proposed works by a long list of barely known composers such as [[\u00c9tienne M\u00e9hul]], [[Nicolas Dalayrac]] and [[Ferdinando Paer]].<ref>Reid, p. 54</ref> During this period, Beecham first encountered the music of [[Frederick Delius]], which he at once loved deeply and with which he became closely associated for the rest of his life.<ref>Jefferson, p. 32</ref>\n\nBeecham quickly concluded that to compete with the two existing London orchestras, the [[Queen's Hall]] Orchestra and the recently founded [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO), his forces must be expanded to full symphonic strength and play in larger halls.<ref>Lucas, p. 24</ref> For two years starting in October 1907, Beecham and the enlarged New Symphony Orchestra gave concerts at the Queen's Hall. He paid little attention to the box office: his programmes were described by a biographer as \"even more certain to deter the public then than it would be in our own day\".<ref name=reid55>Reid, p. 55</ref>  The principal pieces of his first concert with the orchestra were [[Vincent d'Indy|d'Indy]]'s symphonic ballad ''La for\u00eat enchant\u00e9e'', [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana|Smetana]]'s symphonic poem ''\u0160\u00e1rka'', and [[\u00c9douard Lalo|Lalo]]'s little-known [[Symphony in G minor (Lalo)|Symphony in G minor]].<ref>Reid, pp. 55\u201356</ref> Beecham retained an affection for the last work: it was among the works he conducted at his final recording sessions more than fifty years later.<ref name=salter>Salter, p. 4; and Procter-Gregg, pp. 37\u201338</ref>\n\nIn 1908 Beecham and the New Symphony Orchestra parted company, disagreeing about artistic control and, in particular, the deputy system. Under this system, orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement elsewhere, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert.<ref>Russell, p. 10</ref>  The treasurer of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] described it thus: \"''A'', whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends ''B'' (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. ''B'', without your knowledge or consent, sends ''C'' to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, ''C'' sends ''D'', whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away.\"<ref>Reid, p. 50</ref>{{refn|The lines are put into Beecham's mouth in the 1980 play ''Beecham'' by [[Caryl Brahms]] and [[Ned Sherrin]].|group= n}} [[Henry Wood]] had already banned the deputy system in the Queen's Hall Orchestra (provoking rebel players to found the London Symphony Orchestra), and Beecham followed suit.<ref name=reid70>Reid, p. 70</ref> The New Symphony Orchestra survived without him and subsequently became the [[Royal Albert Hall]] Orchestra.<ref name=reid70/>\n\nIn 1909, Beecham founded the Beecham Symphony Orchestra.<ref name=reid71>Reid, p. 71</ref> He did not poach from established symphony orchestras, but instead he recruited from theatre bandrooms, local symphony societies, the [[palm court]]s of hotels, and music colleges.<ref>Reid, pp. 70\u201371</ref> The result was a youthful team&nbsp;\u2013 the typical age of his players was 25. They included names that would become celebrated in their fields, such as [[Albert Sammons]], [[Lionel Tertis]], [[Eric Coates]] and [[Eugene Cruft]].<ref name=reid71/>\n\nBecause he persistently programmed works that did not attract the public, Beecham's musical activities at this time consistently lost money. As a result of his estrangement from his father between 1899 and 1909, his access to the Beecham family fortune was strictly limited. From 1907 he had an annuity of \u00a3700 left to him in his grandfather's will, and his mother subsidised some of his loss-making concerts,<ref name=reid62>Reid, p. 62</ref> but it was not until father and son were reconciled in 1909 that Beecham was able to draw on the family fortune to promote opera.<ref>Reid, p. 88</ref>\n\n===1910\u20131920===\nFrom 1910, subsidised by his father, Beecham realised his ambition to mount opera seasons at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] and other houses. In the [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] opera house, the star singers were regarded as all-important, and conductors were seen as ancillary.<ref name=reid98>Reid, p. 98</ref> Between 1910 and 1939 Beecham did much to change the balance of power.<ref name=reid98/>\n\n[[File:Beecham-Strauss-Pitt-Walter.jpg|thumb|left|alt=face shots of four middle aged men, one bearded, one moustached, two clean shaven|Clockwise from top left: Beecham, [[Richard Strauss]], [[Bruno Walter]] and [[Percy Pitt]], all in 1910]]\nIn 1910, Beecham either conducted or was responsible as [[impresario]] for 190&nbsp;performances at Covent Garden and [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]].
