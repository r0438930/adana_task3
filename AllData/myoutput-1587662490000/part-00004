The Bears increased their lead to 13\u20133 late in the third quarter, with running back [[David Montgomery (American football)|David Montgomery]] diving for a 1-yard touchdown. For a second consecutive week, the Broncos were held without a touchdown for the first three quarters, and were once again plagued by red-zone woes. The Broncos reached the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but were forced to settle on a 32-yard field goal by McManus to pull to within a 13\u20136 deficit. After forcing a Bears' punt, the Broncos were attempting to tie the game and reached the Bears' 2-yard line with 4:51 remaining; however, quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] was intercepted by Bears' cornerback [[Kyle Fuller]]. The Broncos forced another Bears' punt, and got the football back at their own 38-yard line with 2:48 remaining in the game. After burning all of their timeouts, the Broncos finally reached the end zone with 37 seconds remaining, with Flacco connecting with wide receiver [[Emmanuel Sanders]] on a 7-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos were initially planning to go for the two-point conversion, but a delay-of-game penalty pushed them back five yards. The Broncos then attempted the game-tying extra point, which McManus missed wide right; however, Bears' cornerback [[Buster Skrine]] was whistled for an offsides penalty. The Broncos attempted another two-point conversion, which was successful, with a Flacco completion to Sanders. The Bears had one final drive, which began at their own 25-yard line with 31 seconds remaining. On the first play, Broncos' linebacker [[Bradley Chubb]] was whistled for a questionable roughing the passer penalty on Bears' quarter [[Mitchell Trubisky]], which added 15 yards to a 5-yard completion to tight end [[Trey Burton]]. After three consecutive incomplete passes and a 5-yard penalty for having too many men on the field, the Bears faced a 4th-and-15 from their own 40-yard line. Trubisky completed a 25-yard pass to wide receiver [[Allen Robinson]] in the middle of the field to the Broncos' 35-yard line, and the Bears' final timeout was called with one second remaining.

Broncos return specialist [[Diontae Spencer]] returned the ensuing kickoff to the Packers' 43-yard line, but the Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their initial possession. After forcing a Green Bay punt, the Broncos pulled even early in the second quarter, with running back [[Phillip Lindsay]] rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. The next two scoring plays came from each placekicker\u2014a 42-yard field goal by the Packers' [[Mason Crosby]], followed by one from 30 yards by the Broncos' [[Brandon McManus]]. The Broncos suffered turnovers on two of their next three possessions, and the Packers capitalized as a result. First, Broncos quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] was strip-sacked by Packers linebacker [[Preston Smith (linebacker)|Preston Smith]] at the Denver 5-yard line. The Packers reclaimed the lead just before halftime, with a 7-yard touchdown run by running back [[Aaron Jones (running back)|Aaron Jones]]. Then early in the third quarter, linebacker [[Jaire Alexander]] forced a fumble off Broncos tight end [[Noah Fant]] at the Denver 37-yard line, and Jones' second rushing touchdown\u2014from 1 yard out\u2014increased the Packers' lead to 24\u201310. The Broncos responded with a 12-play, 75-yard drive, with Lindsay's second 1-yard touchdown run\u2014this one on a 4th-and-goal. However, McManus hit the left upright on his extra point attempt, leaving the score at 24\u201316. After forcing the Packers to punt, the Broncos advanced to the Green Bay 38-yard line late in the third quarter; however, Flacco was intercepted by safety [[Darnell Savage Jr.]] The Packers increased their lead to 27\u201316 with less than 6 minutes to play, thanks to a 41-yard field goal by Crosby. The Broncos had two more possessions, but could not reach midfield on either drive\u2014both ending with Flacco getting sacked and turning over the football on downs. Flacco was sacked six times, and for a third consecutive game, the Broncos' defense failed to record a sack or force a turnover.

The only points of the first half came courtesy of two field goals by placekicker [[Brandon McManus]]\u2014a 31-yarder in the first quarter and a 53-yarder in the second. A 2-yard touchdown run by running back [[Phillip Lindsay]] increased the Broncos' lead to 13\u20130 late in the third quarter. Titans quarterback [[Marcus Mariota]] was benched midway through the third quarter following a poor performance that included two interceptions, and was replaced by backup quarterback [[Ryan Tannehill]]. The Titans' offense did not advance past midfield until the fourth quarter, and reached the Broncos' 13-yard line with 9:22 remaining; however, Tannehill was sacked by defensive end [[DeMarcus Walker]] on a 4th-and-4. A 48-yard field goal by McManus increased the Broncos' lead to 16\u20130 with 4:57 remaining in the game. The Titans had one last offensive possession, and reached the Broncos' 5-yard line at the two-minute warning. Following an offensive holding penalty, a 10-yard sack of Tannehill by defensive tackle [[Derek Wolfe]] and an 18-yard pass completion from Tannehill to tight end [[Delanie Walker]] to the 12-yard line, Tannehill was intercepted by cornerback [[Kareem Jackson]] near the goal line, ending the Titans' rally attempt and preserving the shutout.

The drive was aided by a pair of penalties against the [[2019 Kansas City Chiefs season|Chiefs]]' defense on two third-down plays. The Broncos elected for a two-point conversion attempt at the 1-yard line following an offside penalty against the Chiefs on the extra-point attempt. However, running back [[Phillip Lindsay]] was denied by the Chiefs' defense, and it was all downhill for the Broncos after that, as the Chiefs scored the final 30 points of the game. First, quarterback [[Patrick Mahomes]] connected on a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Mecole Hardman]], which was followed by a pair of field goals by placekicker [[Harrison Butker]]\u2014a 33-yarder near the end of the first quarter and a 20-yarder midway through the second. Between the two field goals, Mahomes left the game with a dislocated patella and Broncos' punter [[Colby Wadman]] was sacked on a fake punt attempt. The Chiefs' defense then strip-sacked Broncos' quarterback [[Joe Flacco]], with linebacker [[Reggie Ragland]] returning it 5 yards for a touchdown and a 20\u20136 halftime lead. Mahomes was replaced by backup quarterback [[Matt Moore (American football)|Matt Moore]], who launched a 57-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Tyreek Hill]] in the third quarter, and Butker later added a 39-yard field goal in the fourth. After Broncos' placekicker [[Brandon McManus]] missed wide right on a 45-yard field goal attempt late in the second quarter, the Broncos' offense did not advance past the midfield line for the remainder of the game. In addition, Flacco was sacked nine times by the Chiefs' defense, and for a second consecutive week, the Broncos' offense performed poorly on third down, going 1-for-13 (.077).<ref>{{cite news |last=O'Halloran |first=Ryan |title=Broncos Analysis: Last two weeks forgotten as Chiefs outclass Denver |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2019/10/17/broncos-chiefs-week-7-analysis/ |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=October 17, 2019 |accessdate=October 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Week 8: at Indianapolis Colts====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|Denver Broncos|year=2019|border=2}};text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week Eight: Denver Broncos at Indianapolis Colts&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|date=October 27\n|time=1:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]/11:00&nbsp;a.m. MDT\n|road=Broncos\n|R1=0|R2=6|R3=7|R4=0\n|home='''Colts'''\n|H1=0|H2=3|H3=9|H4=3\n|stadium=[[Lucas Oil Stadium]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]\n|attendance=61,653\n|weather=Mostly sunny, {{convert|55|F|C}} ([[retractable roof]] open)\n|referee=[[Walt Anderson (American football)|Walt Anderson]]\n|TV=CBS\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Ian Eagle]], [[Dan Fouts]] and [[Evan Washburn]]\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2019102710/2019/REG8/broncos@colts Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/58017/IND_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* ''No scoring plays.''\n'''Second quarter'''\n* DEN \u2013 [[Brandon McManus]] 21-yard field goal, 12:56.

[[2019 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]]' placekicker [[Adam Vinatieri]], who missed wide-right on a 45-yard field goal attempt on the game's opening drive, kicked a 55-yard field goal at the end of the first half. The Broncos took the opening possession of the second half, and increased their lead to 13\u20133, with running back [[Royce Freeman]] rushing for a 4-yard touchdown. However, the Broncos were held scoreless for the remainder of the game. After a 45-yard field goal by Vinatieri, Colts' running back [[Marlon Mack]] rushed for a 10-yard touchdown. However, Vinatieri missed wide-left on the extra-point attempt, keeping the score at 13\u201312. After an exchange of punts, which included the Broncos nearly blocking a punt in the Colts' end zone, Broncos' defensive end [[Derek Wolfe]] forced a fumble off Colts' quarterback [[Jacoby Brissett]] near midfield and midway through the fourth quarter; however, the Broncos were unable to capitalize, going three-and-out. The Broncos failed to convert a 3rd-and-5 at the Colts' 43-yard line at the two-minute warning, giving the Colts the football on their own 11-yard line. On the first play, Brissett evaded a sack by linebacker [[Von Miller]], and completed a 35-yard pass to wide receiver [[T. Y. Hilton]] on the right sideline that was reviewed, but upheld by instant replay. A personal foul horse-collar tackle penalty on linebacker [[A. J. Johnson (linebacker)|A. J.

Four plays later, Vinatieri atoned for the aforementioned missed field goal and extra-point attempts by kicking the go-ahead 51-yard field goal with 26 seconds remaining. Without any timeouts, the Broncos had two offensive plays at their own 24-yard line, but failed to gain any yardage on either play.

The Broncos' defense yielded four red zone opportunities by the [[2019 Cleveland Browns season|Browns]]' offense in the second quarter, but forced the Browns to settle for four field goals by placekicker [[Austin Seibert]] in the second quarter\u2014the third one occurred after the Browns' defense forced a fumble deep in Broncos' territory. Broncos' placekicker [[Brandon McManus]] added a 43-yard field goal just after the two-minute warning for a 17\u201312 halftime lead. The Broncos' defense subdued the Browns on another red zone opportunity at the 5:23 mark of the third quarter, with linebackers [[Todd Davis (American football)|Todd Davis]] and [[Von Miller]] denying Browns' quarterback [[Baker Mayfield]] on a 4th-and-1 at the 5-yard line. The Browns unsuccessfully challenged the ruling on the field, and seven plays later, the Broncos increased their lead to 24\u201312, with a 30-yard run by running back [[Phillip Lindsay]] late in the third quarter. The Browns responded on their next drive, and with 10:53 remaining in the fourth quarter, Mayfield connected with wide receiver [[Jarvis Landry]] on a 9-yard touchdown to narrow the Broncos' lead to 24\u201319. The drive was aided by a defensive pass interference penalty on cornerback [[Chris Harris, Jr.]] on a 3rd-and-7 at the Broncos' 19-yard line. After forcing a Broncos' punt, the Browns reached the Broncos' 28-yard line with 3:23 remaining in the game and no timeouts, facing a 4th-and-4.

The Raiders got on the scoreboard early in the second quarter, with a 23-yard field goal by placekicker [[Daniel Carlson (American football)|Daniel Carlson]], who missed wide left on a 39-yard attempt midway through the first quarter. The Broncos responded, with a 43-yard field goal by placekicker [[Brandon McManus]]. The Raiders faced a 3rd-and-goal at the Broncos' 5-yard line on their next possession, and a 5-yard pass from quarterback [[Derek Carr]] to wide receiver [[Hunter Renfrow]] was initially ruled a touchdown. However, after a booth review, Renfrow was ruled down at the 1-yard line. On the very next play, fullback [[Alec Ingold]] was stopped inches short of the goal line on fourth down by the Broncos' defense. The Raiders thought Ingold had broken the plane of the goal line, and unsuccessfully challenged the ruling of the play, resulting in a turnover on downs.

However, after a false start and an unnecessary roughness penalty on offensive tackle [[Garett Bolles]] pushes the Broncos back 15 yards, McManus missed wide-right on a 57-yard field goal attempt, giving the Raiders one last possession at their own 47-yard line.

The Broncos fell behind 14\u20130 in the first half against the [[2019 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] on [[Monday Night Football]]. On the game's opening drive, Raiders' quarterback [[Derek Carr]] threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Tyrell Williams]], and running back [[Josh Jacobs]] added a 2-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. Broncos placekicker [[Brandon McManus]] missed short on a 63-yard field goal attempt just before halftime. The Broncos reached the red zone on their first three possessions of the second half, but were forced to settle for field goals by McManus on each drive\u2014two 26-yarders in the third quarter and a 39-yarder midway through the fourth quarter. Wide receiver [[DaeSean Hamilton]] dropped a potential touchdown pass on the second drive. Following the second field goal, the Raiders increased their lead to 21\u20136, with Jacobs' second touchdown run of the game (a 4-yarder), and then to 24\u20139, with a 29-yard field goal by placekicker [[Daniel Carlson (American football)|Daniel Carlson]] at the 4:41 mark of the third quarter. After three red zone attempts that all resulted in short field goals, the Broncos finally reached the end zone with 2:18 remaining in the fourth quarter. [[Joe Flacco]], in his debut as the Broncos' starting quarterback, connected on a 1\u2013yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Emmanuel Sanders]] to narrow the Raiders' lead to 24\u201316.

The Bears increased their lead to 13\u20133 late in the third quarter, with running back [[David Montgomery (American football)|David Montgomery]] diving for a 1-yard touchdown. For a second consecutive week, the Broncos were held without a touchdown for the first three quarters, and were once again plagued by red-zone woes. The Broncos reached the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but were forced to settle on a 32-yard field goal by McManus to pull to within a 13\u20136 deficit. After forcing a Bears' punt, the Broncos were attempting to tie the game and reached the Bears' 2-yard line with 4:51 remaining; however, quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] was intercepted by Bears' cornerback [[Kyle Fuller]]. The Broncos forced another Bears' punt, and got the football back at their own 38-yard line with 2:48 remaining in the game. After burning all of their timeouts, the Broncos finally reached the end zone with 37 seconds remaining, with Flacco connecting with wide receiver [[Emmanuel Sanders]] on a 7-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos were initially planning to go for the two-point conversion, but a delay-of-game penalty pushed them back five yards. The Broncos then attempted the game-tying extra point, which McManus missed wide right; however, Bears' cornerback [[Buster Skrine]] was whistled for an offsides penalty. The Broncos attempted another two-point conversion, which was successful, with a Flacco completion to Sanders. The Bears had one final drive, which began at their own 25-yard line with 31 seconds remaining. On the first play, Broncos' linebacker [[Bradley Chubb]] was whistled for a questionable roughing the passer penalty on Bears' quarter [[Mitchell Trubisky]], which added 15 yards to a 5-yard completion to tight end [[Trey Burton]]. After three consecutive incomplete passes and a 5-yard penalty for having too many men on the field, the Bears faced a 4th-and-15 from their own 40-yard line. Trubisky completed a 25-yard pass to wide receiver [[Allen Robinson]] in the middle of the field to the Broncos' 35-yard line, and the Bears' final timeout was called with one second remaining.

Broncos return specialist [[Diontae Spencer]] returned the ensuing kickoff to the Packers' 43-yard line, but the Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their initial possession. After forcing a Green Bay punt, the Broncos pulled even early in the second quarter, with running back [[Phillip Lindsay]] rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. The next two scoring plays came from each placekicker\u2014a 42-yard field goal by the Packers' [[Mason Crosby]], followed by one from 30 yards by the Broncos' [[Brandon McManus]]. The Broncos suffered turnovers on two of their next three possessions, and the Packers capitalized as a result. First, Broncos quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] was strip-sacked by Packers linebacker [[Preston Smith (linebacker)|Preston Smith]] at the Denver 5-yard line. The Packers reclaimed the lead just before halftime, with a 7-yard touchdown run by running back [[Aaron Jones (running back)|Aaron Jones]]. Then early in the third quarter, linebacker [[Jaire Alexander]] forced a fumble off Broncos tight end [[Noah Fant]] at the Denver 37-yard line, and Jones' second rushing touchdown\u2014from 1 yard out\u2014increased the Packers' lead to 24\u201310. The Broncos responded with a 12-play, 75-yard drive, with Lindsay's second 1-yard touchdown run\u2014this one on a 4th-and-goal. However, McManus hit the left upright on his extra point attempt, leaving the score at 24\u201316. After forcing the Packers to punt, the Broncos advanced to the Green Bay 38-yard line late in the third quarter; however, Flacco was intercepted by safety [[Darnell Savage Jr.]] The Packers increased their lead to 27\u201316 with less than 6 minutes to play, thanks to a 41-yard field goal by Crosby. The Broncos had two more possessions, but could not reach midfield on either drive\u2014both ending with Flacco getting sacked and turning over the football on downs.

[[2019 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]]' placekicker [[Adam Vinatieri]], who missed wide-right on a 45-yard field goal attempt on the game's opening drive, kicked a 55-yard field goal at the end of the first half. The Broncos took the opening possession of the second half, and increased their lead to 13\u20133, with running back [[Royce Freeman]] rushing for a 4-yard touchdown. However, the Broncos were held scoreless for the remainder of the game. After a 45-yard field goal by Vinatieri, Colts' running back [[Marlon Mack]] rushed for a 10-yard touchdown. However, Vinatieri missed wide-left on the extra-point attempt, keeping the score at 13\u201312. After an exchange of punts, which included the Broncos nearly blocking a punt in the Colts' end zone, Broncos' defensive end [[Derek Wolfe]] forced a fumble off Colts' quarterback [[Jacoby Brissett]] near midfield and midway through the fourth quarter; however, the Broncos were unable to capitalize, going three-and-out. The Broncos failed to convert a 3rd-and-5 at the Colts' 43-yard line at the two-minute warning, giving the Colts the football on their own 11-yard line. On the first play, Brissett evaded a sack by linebacker [[Von Miller]], and completed a 35-yard pass to wide receiver [[T. Y. Hilton]] on the right sideline that was reviewed, but upheld by instant replay. A personal foul horse-collar tackle penalty on linebacker [[A. J. Johnson (linebacker)|A. J. Johnson]] added 15-yards to a 5-yard pass completion from Brissett to running back [[Nyheim Hines]]. Four plays later, Vinatieri atoned for the aforementioned missed field goal and extra-point attempts by kicking the go-ahead 51-yard field goal with 26 seconds remaining. Without any timeouts, the Broncos had two offensive plays at their own 24-yard line, but failed to gain any yardage on either play.

The Broncos' defense yielded four red zone opportunities by the [[2019 Cleveland Browns season|Browns]]' offense in the second quarter, but forced the Browns to settle for four field goals by placekicker [[Austin Seibert]] in the second quarter\u2014the third one occurred after the Browns' defense forced a fumble deep in Broncos' territory. Broncos' placekicker [[Brandon McManus]] added a 43-yard field goal just after the two-minute warning for a 17\u201312 halftime lead. The Broncos' defense subdued the Browns on another red zone opportunity at the 5:23 mark of the third quarter, with linebackers [[Todd Davis (American football)|Todd Davis]] and [[Von Miller]] denying Browns' quarterback [[Baker Mayfield]] on a 4th-and-1 at the 5-yard line. The Browns unsuccessfully challenged the ruling on the field, and seven plays later, the Broncos increased their lead to 24\u201312, with a 30-yard run by running back [[Phillip Lindsay]] late in the third quarter. The Browns responded on their next drive, and with 10:53 remaining in the fourth quarter, Mayfield connected with wide receiver [[Jarvis Landry]] on a 9-yard touchdown to narrow the Broncos' lead to 24\u201319.
