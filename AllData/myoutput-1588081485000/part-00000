Originally designed by [[Baldassarre Longhena]] in the mid-17th century, the construction was completed by Gian Antonio Gaspari in 1710. As at Longhena's [[Ca' Rezzonico]], a double order of [[Colossal order|colossal columns]] and colonnettes flanking arch-headed windows, reinterpreting a motif of [[Jacopo Sansovino]], Longhena creates the impression of double [[loggia]]s extending across the main [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]] frontage, above a boldly [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] basement. Today it is one of the 11 museums run by the [[Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia]] system.\n\n==The building==\n[[File:Palazzo Pesaro, Venice, Italy.jpg|thumbnail|Pesaro Palace, Venice, Italy. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]\nThe palace was built in the second half of the 17th century for the noble and wealthy [[Pesaro family]], a project by the Venetian architect, [[Baldassarre Longhena]], who also designed the church of the Salute and [[Ca' Rezzonico]]. Works began in 1659 starting from the landside; the courtyard was completed by 1676. By 1679, the fa\u00e7ade on the Grand Canal had already reached the second floor, but when Longhena died 3 years after, the palace was still unfinished. The Pesaro family then entrusted its completion to [[Gian Antonio Gaspari]] who concluded it in 1710, according to the original project. Longhena was inspired by [[Jacopo Sansovino|Sansovinian]] classicism when designing Ca\u2019 Pesaro, creating expressions of a new and sumptuous harmony, with its complex and powerful composition, yet well-balanced. The Sansovinian motif is more explicit on the first floor, with the [[chiaroscuro]] rhythm of the arches and columns. On the second floor, the fa\u00e7ade is enriched by ornamentation in the pendentives and the entablatures. The entrance-hall, laid out along the axis of the entire building, contrasts with the clarity of the courtyard, articulated around the monumental well and enclosed by a terrace and an ashlar-arcade. The palace still conserves some of the [[fresco]] and oil decorations of the ceilings by artists such as [[Niccol\u00f2 Bambini|Bambini]], [[Giovanni Battista Pittoni|Pittoni]], Crosato, [[Francesco Trevisani|Trevisani]] and [[Girolamo Brusaferro]]. The collections of the Pesaro family, as documented in the archives, must have been even more remarkable, including works by artists such as [[Alvise Vivarini|Vivarini]], [[Vittore Carpaccio|Carpaccio]], [[Giovanni Bellini|Bellini]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], as well as other famous Venetian artists of the 17th and 18th centuries. This great heritage was completely dispersed by 1830, the year of the death of the last Pesaro family member, who auctioned most of the collection in [[London]]. The palace was passed on firstly to the Gradenigo family and then to the Armenian Mechitarist Fathers, who used it as a college. It was finally bought by the Bevilacqua family, and became the property of Duchess Felicita [[Bevilacqua La Masa]]. It was she who decreed the present usage of the building, bequeathing it to the city in 1898, as a museum of Modern Art.\n\nIn 1902, thanks to the bequest of the Duchess, the City Council decided to use the palace to host the [[Modern Art]] municipal collection, which had been started in 1897, when the second [[Venice Biennale]] was held. Shortly afterwards, between 1908 and 1924, it also was used to host the Bevilacqua La Masa exhibitions, which, in lively contrast with the Venice Biennale, favored a generation of young artists, including [[Boccioni]], [[Casorati]], [[Gino Rossi (painter)|Gino Rossi]], [[Juti Ravenna]] and [[Arturo Martini]]. The collection was enriched over the years by further acquisitions and donations.\n\n==Modern Art Museum==\nCa' Pesaro houses   19th and 20th century collections of paintings and sculptures, as well as a section on graphic art.\n\n* Room 1: Works by Venetian painters of the second half of the 19th century, such as [[Ippolito Caffi]], [[Guglielmo Ciardi]], [[Giacomo Favretto]], and [[Pietro Fragiacomo]] are on display, testifying to the city's art variety in the 19th and the early 20th century.\n* Room 2: This room brings together 19th century Italian works: there are paintings by [[Telemaco Signorini|Signorini]], [[Giovanni Fattori]], [[De Nittis]], [[Pellizza]], [[Gaetano Previati]], and [[Angelo Morbelli]]. The city of Venice was stirred by the presence of these artists at the city's Biennale to acquire their works, which testify to the vitality of Italian painting at the turn of the century. The collection of sculptures by [[Medardo Rosso]] is also of special importance.\n* Central Hall: The central hall displays works from the very first [[Venice Biennale]] up to the 1950s. The room begins with a homage to one of the founders of the Biennale, [[Riccardo Selvatico]], portrayed by [[Alessandro Milesi]], and continues with works by artists from England, Belgium, Scandinavia, Germany, France and Russia. Alongside masterpieces (such as [[Gustav Klimt]]\u2019s ''Judith II'' and ''Aunt Luisa'' by [[Ignacio Zuloaga|Zuloaga]]), a number of other paintings that met with outstanding success during the early editions of the Biennale by [[Filipp Malyavin]], [[Charles Cottet]], and [[Joaquin Sorolla]] are exhibited. These works give an idea of the Biennale\u2019s role in promoting \u201csalon-art\u201d, followed by others of experimental kind such as [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]\u2019s ''White Zig Zags''. Finally, works from the museum\u2019s graphic art collection and sculptures are also on display, together with some renowned paintings by [[Pierre Bonnard]] and [[Marc Chagall]].\n* Room 3: This room is devoted to [[Adolfo Wildt]]'s sculptures, donated to Ca' Pesaro by the Wildt-Scheiwiller heirs in 1990. The Milanese artist was a protagonist of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], but also of a period of experimentalism and innovation that influenced later generations.\n* Room 4: The De Lisi bequest, exhibited in this room, was donated to the museum in 1961, and include major artworks by Italian and foreign artists. There are paintings by [[Felice Casorati]] (a central figure of the intellectual avant-garde in [[Turin]] during the early 1920s), [[Mario Sironi]], and [[Alberto Martini]]. Other artists present in this room include [[Carlo Carr\u00e0|Carr\u00e0]], [[Filippo De Pisis]], [[Giorgio Morandi]], [[Massimo Campigli]], [[Ottone Rosai]], and [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. [[Yves Tanguy|Tanguy]], [[Brauner]], [[Roberto Matta|Matta Echaurren]], [[Joan Mir\u00f2]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], who testify the collector\u2019s preference for [[Surrealism|surrealist]] themes, even in artists not generally identified with the movement.\n* Rooms 5 and 6: These rooms are devoted to the ''Ca\u2019 Pesaro Years'', a term applied to the first season of the [[Bevilacqua La Masa]] exhibitions organized by Nino Barbantini (from 1908 to 1924). The works exhibited here brought some of the most important Italian artists to public notice and provide a clear idea of this period. Works by [[Ugo Valeri]], [[Alberto Martini]], [[Boccioni]], [[Gino Rossi (painter)|Gino Rossi]], [[Umberto Moggioli]], and [[Felice Casorati]] on display, alongside the Burano School, which is represented by [[Pio Semeghini]]. The rooms also displays later works  by [[Guido Cadorin]], [[Guido Marussig]], and [[Gennaro Favai]].\n* Room 7: This room offers an overview of the Italian art trends in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, with works by [[Antonio Donghi]], [[Luigi Tito]], [[Lorenzo Viani]], [[Giuseppe Cesetti]], and [[Guido Cadorin]]. A tapestry work by [[Fortunato Depero]] is displayed together with works by [[Enrico Prampolini]] and [[Toti Scialoja]]. In the center of the room is a work by [[Umberto Mastroianni]]. Other artists present in this room include [[Leone Minassian]] and [[Franco Gentilini]].\n* Room 8: This room offers an overview of some Italian art trends during the post-[[World War II]] period. [[Figurative art]] is well represented by works by [[Filippo De Pisis]], [[Fausto Pirandello]], [[Bruno Cassinari]], and [[Pericle Fazzini]]. By contrast, the informal experiences of [[Renato Birolli]], [[Ennio Morlotti]], [[Zoran Music]], [[Afro Basadella]], and [[Achille Perilli]] are flanked by abstract works by [[Bice Lazzari]]. Works range from [[Emilio Vedova]]\u2019s ''Europe'' to [[Renato Birlolli]]\u2019s ''Wall of a Fisherman\u2019s House''. Visitors can also see on display works by artists such as [[Mirko Basaldella]] and [[Leoncillo]].\n* Room 9: After [[World War II]], Venetian art entered a new, lively phase, with the ''[[Fronte Nuovo delle Arti]]'' and the [[Spatialism]]. The protagonists of these movements are all present in this room, including [[Armando Pizzinato]], [[Giuseppe Santomaso]], [[Emilio Vedova]], [[Parmeggiani Tancredi|Tancredi]], [[Edmondo Bacci]], [[Guidi]], [[Bruno Saetti]], [[Mario Deluigi]], [[Alberto Gianquinto]], and [[Vittorio Basaglia]].\n* Room 10: A small [[Contemporary Art]] gallery inside the museum, this room is dedicated to temporary exhibitions on unpublished works, young artists\u2019 experiments, and video art.\n\n==Oriental Art Museum==\nThe upper floor is dedicated to [[The Oriental Art Museum (Venice)|the Oriental Art Museum]], housing some 30,000 objects, mainly from Japan (armoury, inros, netsukes, paintings by [[Koryusai]], [[Harunobu]], [[Hokusai]], etc.), but also from China and Indonesia. This collection of oriental objects was brought back from a stay in Asia by [[Prince Henry, Count of Bardi|Prince Henry of Bourbon-Parma, Count of Bardi]], at the end of the 19th century, and bequeathed to the Italian state.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Venezia - Ca' Pesaro - Galleria Internazionale d'Arte Moderna 01.jpg|Galleria Internazionale d'Arte Moderna\nFile:Ca' pesaro, portego, 01.jpg\nFile:Francesco Guardi Ca Pesaro 1755-60.jpg|Francesco Guardi Ca Pesaro 1755-60\nFile:Salle du mus\u00e9e dart oriental (Venise) (6175353471).jpg|art oriental\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Ca' Pesaro (Venice)}}\n* {{Official website|1=http://capesaro.visitmuve.it/en/home/}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090929081020/http://www.arteorientale.org/sito/home.html Oriental Art Museum]\n\n{{Venice landmarks}}\n{{coord|45.440381|12.331145|type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Art museums and galleries in Venice]]\n[[Category:Art museums established in 1902]]\n[[Category:Baroque architecture in Venice]]\n[[Category:Houses completed in 1710]]\n[[Category:Modern art museums in Italy]]\n[[Category:Museums in Venice]]\n[[Category:Palaces in Sestiere Santa Croce|Pesaro]]\n[[Category:Palaces on the Grand Canal (Venice)|Pesaro]]\n[[Category:1902 establishments in Italy]]\n[[Category:Pesaro family]]\n", "text_old": "{{No footnotes|date=November 2012}}\n{{Infobox museum\n|name = Ca' Pesaro \u2013 International Gallery of Modern Art\n| image            = Ca'Pesaro di Baldassarre Longhena facciata sul Canal Grande.jpg\n| imagesize        = 200\n| caption          = Ca' Pesaro in Venice\n| alt              = Ca' Pesaro in Venice\n|established = {{start date|1902}}\n|location = Santa Croce 2076,<br />30135 [[Venice]], [[Italy]]\n|type = [[Art museum]], [[Historic site]]\n|director = Silvio Fuso\n|website = {{URL|1=http://capesaro.visitmuve.it/en/home/|2=capesaro.visitmuve.it}}\n}}\nThe '''Ca' Pesaro''' is a [[Baroque]] marble palace facing the [[Grand Canal of Venice|Grand Canal]] of [[Venice]], Italy.
