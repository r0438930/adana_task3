Production halted again in 1950 when the Standard engine ceased to be available, but resumed in 1955 when a suitable replacement, the side-valve 1,172 cc Ford 100E engine was found, and has continued ever since.\n\nThe 4/4 now uses the +8 chassis and a Ford engine.\n\n=== Morgan +8 ===\n{{main|Morgan Plus 8}}\nFaced with the decreasing availability of large four-cylinder engines for use in their +4 models, Morgan began to install the recently available [[Rover V8 engine]] in their cars in 1968, giving these cars the model designation \"+8\".\n\nThe engine displacement jumped from the 2.3&nbsp;L of the Triumph TR4 engine to 3.5&nbsp;L, then 3.9&nbsp;L (1990), 4.0 (1998\u20132004) with an optional 4.6L (1996\u20132000) all based on the same Land Rover block. However, this V-8 was no heavier than the Triumph engine. These features made the +8 accelerate much more quickly than the early +4 and also improved its road-holding capability.\n\nHorsepower (143\u2013204&nbsp;bhp), weight and performance varied with emission and structural laws through its history. Thus powered, the car could accelerate from 0\u201360 mph in 5.6 seconds. In its final form, the GEMS Land Rover V8 produced {{convert|190|hp|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:2006 SAG - Morgan roadster - 05.jpg|thumb|Roadster at 76e international Motorshow Geneva 2006]]\n\n=== Roadster ===\n{{main|Morgan Roadster}}\nIn 2004, Morgan came out with a traditional styled model to replace the departing Plus 8. The Mk I Roadsters with the Ford UK Mondeo V6 produced 223&nbsp;bhp (166&nbsp;kW, 226 PS) at 6150 rev/min. It had a [[Magna PT|Getrag]] gearbox with direct drive in 5th with a 3.08 axle ratio. Later Marks had a Ford gearbox with direct drive in 4th with a 3.73 axle ratio. The overall gearing is virtually the same. The later Roadsters were powered by a Ford UK Mondeo V6 producing {{convert|204|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 2007, the Mondeo engine was replaced by a US-specification version of the same engine in the Roadster II. In 2011\u201312, the engine was replaced by the 3.7 Duratec Cyclone engine and output increased to {{convert|280|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.

(Contrary to popular myth, however, the [[chassis]] is metal; [[aluminium]] for the Aero 8.) The Aero 8, with a [[BMW]] [[V8 engine]] in a car weighing less than a [[BMW Z4]] and considerably less than a [[BMW M3]], (though more than traditional Morgans) is even faster than the Plus 8, delivering what ''[[Autoweek]]'' magazine termed [[supercar]] performance. The newest Aero 8 (series V), presented in March 2015, puts out {{convert|367|hp|abbr=on}} at 6100 rpm with the company suggesting a top speed of over {{convert|170|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Due to the Aero 8's light weight it can do 0\u201362&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) in 4.5 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-2006-Morgan-Aeromax.htm |title=2006 Morgan Aeromax |publisher=Seriouswheels.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring its customer production lifetime (2002\u20132009), the Aero was configured in five official versions, (I, II, III, IV, the Aero America and V) with mild variations in styling, engines, transmissions, braking and suspension. The company canceled the model in 2009 but relaunched it in 2015 for 2016 deliveries. The year of highest production for any Aero variation was 2002.\n\n=== Morgan AeroMax ===\n[[File:Morgan-Aeromax-rear.jpg|thumb|Morgan AeroMax, showing distinct boat tail rear]]\n{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}\nThe Aero was followed by the Aeromax, a limited edition of 100 units produced between 2008 and early 2010.

The Eva GT would use [[BMW N54]] twin-turbo straight-6 producing 302&nbsp;bhp, Euro-6 emissions compliant. Shown at Pebble Beach in clay in 2010 and expected to go on sale in 2012, deposits have been taken since 2010. At the end of 2011, Morgan announced that it would use new magnesium technology for the body and therefore it would not be represented until 2014 with deliveries after that.

This vehicle was driven across the States, from New York to Los Angeles by Charles Morgan and his wife, covering 3000 miles, in the [[Gumball 3000]]. At the end of the seven-day drive, the Morgan 3 Wheeler was awarded the \"Spirit of Gumball\" prize.\n\n== General characteristics ==\n[[File:MorganSuspension.jpg|thumb|Traditional Morgan [[sliding pillar suspension]]]]\nIn spite of their traditional design, Morgans have always had sporting or \"sports car\" performance, due to their extremely low weight.\n\nAmong their enthusiasts, Morgans are affectionately known as \"Moggies\".\n\n=== Suspension ===\nH.F.S. Morgan's 1909 runabout used [[sliding pillar suspension]], an [[independent front suspension]] system with each front wheel mounted on a stub axle able to slide up and down a fixed pillar that also acts as the [[kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]] and supported by a spring and external shock absorber (damper). One advantage is reduced unsprung weight, theoretically allowing the tyre and wheel to better respond to road surface irregularities. The Morgan system is described as an 'inverted' sliding pillar, as the pillar is fixed and the hub carrier slides over it. Earlier systems had the wheel carried on the pillar, sliding through a bush on the axle.\n\nMorgan used developments of this suspension system throughout its existence, and it is still used on Morgan's \"classic\" line, although not on the Aero 8 or its derivatives. It has been cancelled, along with all the Morgan Classic line, in 2019. However, some \"classics\", shipped in parts to avoid the need for normal compliancy, will be shipped to the USA, and assembled there for an indefinite period.\n\n== Models ==\n* 1909 Runabout\n* 1911\u20131939 [[V-Twin 3-wheeler]]\n* 1932\u20131952 [[F-Series 3-wheeler]]\n* 1936\u2013present [[Morgan 4/4|4/4 Two-Seater and Four-Seater]]\n* 1950\u20131969 [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 1964\u20131967 [[Morgan +4+|Plus 4 Plus]]\n* 1965-1967 [[Morgan +4#Competition use|Morgan +4 Competition two seater]]\n* 1968\u20132004 (and 2012\u201319) [[Morgan Plus 8|Plus 8]]\n* 1985\u20132000 [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 2001\u20132009 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero 8]]\n* 2004\u20132012 [[Morgan Roadster|V6 Roadster]]\n* 2005\u2013present [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 2006\u2013pending [[Morgan LIFEcar]]\n* 2008\u20132009 [[Morgan Aero 8|AeroMax]]\n* 2009\u2013present [[Morgan 4/4 Sport]]\n* 2010\u20132015 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero SuperSports]]\n* 2010\u2013cancelled [[Morgan Eva GT]]\n* 2011\u2013cancelled [[Morgan Plus E]]\n* 2011\u20132012 [[Morgan Plus 4 Supersports]]\n* 2011\u2013present [[Morgan Anniversary 4/4]]\n* 2012\u20132015 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero Coupe]]\n* 2012\u2013present [[Morgan 3-Wheeler]]\n* 2012\u201319 [[Morgan Aero 8]]\n* 2012\u2013present [[Morgan Roadster|Roadster 3.7]]\n* 2015\u201319 [[Morgan Aero 8]]\n* 2018 Morgan EV3<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.morgan-motor.co.uk/ev3/|title=EV3|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n* 2019\u2013present [[Morgan Plus Six]]\n\n== Motorsports ==\nMorgan cars can be found in many areas of motorsport, from club and historic racing to more prominent examples, including the Le Mans 24hr race.

Morgan quit the [[Great Western Railway]] in 1904 and co-founded a motor sales and servicing garage in Malvern Link. In 1909 he designed and built a car for his own use.

Production of three wheelers approached 1000 by WW1 and quickly resumed with both racing and touring models. Morgan's first four wheeler came in 1935 with three wheelers phased out in 1952.

Production halted again in 1950 when the Standard engine ceased to be available, but resumed in 1955 when a suitable replacement, the side-valve 1,172 cc Ford 100E engine was found, and has continued ever since.\n\nThe 4/4 now uses the +8 chassis and a Ford engine.\n\n=== Morgan +8 ===\n{{main|Morgan Plus 8}}\nFaced with the decreasing availability of large four-cylinder engines for use in their +4 models, Morgan began to install the recently available [[Rover V8 engine]] in their cars in 1968, giving these cars the model designation \"+8\".\n\nThe engine displacement jumped from the 2.3&nbsp;L of the Triumph TR4 engine to 3.5&nbsp;L, then 3.9&nbsp;L (1990), 4.0 (1998\u20132004) with an optional 4.6L (1996\u20132000) all based on the same Land Rover block. However, this V-8 was no heavier than the Triumph engine. These features made the +8 accelerate much more quickly than the early +4 and also improved its road-holding capability.\n\nHorsepower (143\u2013204&nbsp;bhp), weight and performance varied with emission and structural laws through its history. Thus powered, the car could accelerate from 0\u201360 mph in 5.6 seconds. In its final form, the GEMS Land Rover V8 produced {{convert|190|hp|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:2006 SAG - Morgan roadster - 05.jpg|thumb|Roadster at 76e international Motorshow Geneva 2006]]\n\n=== Roadster ===\n{{main|Morgan Roadster}}\nIn 2004, Morgan came out with a traditional styled model to replace the departing Plus 8. The Mk I Roadsters with the Ford UK Mondeo V6 produced 223&nbsp;bhp (166&nbsp;kW, 226 PS) at 6150 rev/min. It had a [[Magna PT|Getrag]] gearbox with direct drive in 5th with a 3.08 axle ratio. Later Marks had a Ford gearbox with direct drive in 4th with a 3.73 axle ratio. The overall gearing is virtually the same. The later Roadsters were powered by a Ford UK Mondeo V6 producing {{convert|204|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 2007, the Mondeo engine was replaced by a US-specification version of the same engine in the Roadster II. In 2011\u201312, the engine was replaced by the 3.7 Duratec Cyclone engine and output increased to {{convert|280|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.

(Contrary to popular myth, however, the [[chassis]] is metal; [[aluminium]] for the Aero 8.) The Aero 8, with a [[BMW]] [[V8 engine]] in a car weighing less than a [[BMW Z4]] and considerably less than a [[BMW M3]], (though more than traditional Morgans) is even faster than the Plus 8, delivering what ''[[Autoweek]]'' magazine termed [[supercar]] performance. The newest Aero 8 (series V), presented in March 2015, puts out {{convert|367|hp|abbr=on}} at 6100 rpm with the company suggesting a top speed of over {{convert|170|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Due to the Aero 8's light weight it can do 0\u201362&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) in 4.5 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-2006-Morgan-Aeromax.htm |title=2006 Morgan Aeromax |publisher=Seriouswheels.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring its customer production lifetime (2002\u20132009), the Aero was configured in five official versions, (I, II, III, IV, the Aero America and V) with mild variations in styling, engines, transmissions, braking and suspension. The company canceled the model in 2009 but relaunched it in 2015 for 2016 deliveries. The year of highest production for any Aero variation was 2002.\n\n=== Morgan AeroMax ===\n[[File:Morgan-Aeromax-rear.jpg|thumb|Morgan AeroMax, showing distinct boat tail rear]]\n{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}\nThe Aero was followed by the Aeromax, a limited edition of 100 units produced between 2008 and early 2010. The Aeromax was a coup\u00e9 variation of the Aero 8. Customers have included [[Richard Hammond]], [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Paul O'Grady]].\n\n=== Morgan Aero SuperSports ===\n{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}\nThe Morgan Aero SuperSports is a [[Targa top|targa-roofed]] version of the AeroMax, sharing its bonded aluminium chassis and lower bodywork with the coupe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/CarReviews/FirstDrives/Morgan-Aero-Supersports-V8-Supersports-auto/251830/|title=Morgan Aero 8 Review (2017) \u2013 Autocar|website=www.autocar.co.uk|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> It was launched at the 2009 Pebble Beach car show in California.

The Eva GT would use [[BMW N54]] twin-turbo straight-6 producing 302&nbsp;bhp, Euro-6 emissions compliant. Shown at Pebble Beach in clay in 2010 and expected to go on sale in 2012, deposits have been taken since 2010. At the end of 2011, Morgan announced that it would use new magnesium technology for the body and therefore it would not be represented until 2014 with deliveries after that. In 2013 dealers confirmed that the EvaGT had been cancelled.\n\n=== {{Visible anchor|Morgan 3-Wheeler}} ===\n{{main|Morgan 3-Wheeler}}\n[[File:2012 US-spec Morgan 3-wheeler.jpg|thumb|Morgan 3-wheeler (2012)]]\n\nThe Morgan Motor Company announced that they would launch the \"3&nbsp;Wheeler\" in 2011<ref name=\"EIL20101104\">{{cite news| title = 2011 Morgan Threewheeler| url = http://www.insideline.com/morgan/2011-morgan-threewheeler.html| magazine = Edmunds Inside Line| publisher = Edmunds Inc.| date = 4 November 2010 | accessdate = 19 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Car20101103\">{{cite news| title = Morgan 3&nbsp;Wheeler (2011) first official pictures| first = Sarah-Jayne| last = Harrison | url = http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/News/Search-Results/First-Official-Pictures/Morgan-going-back-to-their-roots/| magazine = Car Magazine| publisher = Bauer Media| location = Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, UK| date = 3 November 2010| accessdate = 19 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"AE20101104\">{{cite news| title=Morgan revives the Threewheeler| first=Tom| last=Phillips| url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/259048/morgan_revives_the_threewheeler.html| magazine=Auto Express| publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]| location=London| date=4 November 2010| accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"AW20101103\">{{cite news| title=Morgan Threewheeler returns after 58-year break| first=Brad| last=Constant| url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20101103/CARNEWS/101109946| magazine=Autoweek| publisher=Crain Communications| location=Detroit| date=11 March 2010| accessdate=19 February 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311062516/http://www.autoweek.com/article/20101103/CARNEWS/101109946| archive-date=11 March 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topgearhk.com/2019/03/29/morgan-3-wheeler%EF%BC%882012%E5%B9%B4%E5%9E%8B%EF%BC%89%E9%99%B8%E5%9C%B0%E9%9B%99%E7%BF%BC%E6%A9%9F/|title=Morgan 3 Wheeler car review \u2013 TopGearhk|website=www.topgearhk|accessdate=29 Mar 2019}}</ref> at the [[Geneva Motor Show]].<ref name=\"Car20101103\" /><ref name=\"AE20101104\" /> The 3&nbsp;Wheeler was initially said to have a [[Harley-Davidson]] ''Screaming Eagle'' V-twin engine and a [[Mazda]] 5-speed manual transmission,<ref name= \"EIL20101104\" /><ref name=\"Car20101103\" /><ref name=\"AE20101104\" /><ref name=\"AW20101103\" /><ref name= \"WR20101103\">{{cite news| title=First Look: 2011 Morgan Threewheeler| first=Seyth| last=Miersma| url= http://www.windingroad.com/articles/news/first-look-2011-morgan-threewheeler/| magazine=Winding Road| location= Ypsilanti, Michigan, US| date=3 November 2010| accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref> and was estimated to deliver {{cvt|115|hp|kW|0}}<ref name=\"EIL20101104\" /><ref name=\"AE20101104\" /><ref name=\"AW20101103\" /><ref name= \"WR20101103\" /> at the rear wheel.<ref name=\"AW20101103\" /><ref name=\"WR20101103\" /> However, the prototype that was shown at Geneva had an [[S&S Cycle|S&S]] engine.

This was the first time in 10 years that Morgan had had a presence at the largest of the American car shows and was the first US specification Morgan 3-Wheeler in the United States. The Morgan 3 Wheeler was voted one of the \"Hottest Cars Of The Show\" by G4TV.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hardiman|first=Paul |website=Hagerty.com |title=The New Morgan Three Wheeler|url=http://www.hagerty.com/articles-videos/Articles/2012/11/12/TheNew-2012-Morgan|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2012, Manhattan Motorsports took delivery of Charles Morgan's Superdry edition Morgan 3-Wheeler and prepared it for its first major American trial. This vehicle was driven across the States, from New York to Los Angeles by Charles Morgan and his wife, covering 3000 miles, in the [[Gumball 3000]]. At the end of the seven-day drive, the Morgan 3 Wheeler was awarded the \"Spirit of Gumball\" prize.\n\n== General characteristics ==\n[[File:MorganSuspension.jpg|thumb|Traditional Morgan [[sliding pillar suspension]]]]\nIn spite of their traditional design, Morgans have always had sporting or \"sports car\" performance, due to their extremely low weight.\n\nAmong their enthusiasts, Morgans are affectionately known as \"Moggies\".\n\n=== Suspension ===\nH.F.S. Morgan's 1909 runabout used [[sliding pillar suspension]], an [[independent front suspension]] system with each front wheel mounted on a stub axle able to slide up and down a fixed pillar that also acts as the [[kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]] and supported by a spring and external shock absorber (damper). One advantage is reduced unsprung weight, theoretically allowing the tyre and wheel to better respond to road surface irregularities. The Morgan system is described as an 'inverted' sliding pillar, as the pillar is fixed and the hub carrier slides over it. Earlier systems had the wheel carried on the pillar, sliding through a bush on the axle.\n\nMorgan used developments of this suspension system throughout its existence, and it is still used on Morgan's \"classic\" line, although not on the Aero 8 or its derivatives. It has been cancelled, along with all the Morgan Classic line, in 2019. However, some \"classics\", shipped in parts to avoid the need for normal compliancy, will be shipped to the USA, and assembled there for an indefinite period.\n\n== Models ==\n* 1909 Runabout\n* 1911\u20131939 [[V-Twin 3-wheeler]]\n* 1932\u20131952 [[F-Series 3-wheeler]]\n* 1936\u2013present [[Morgan 4/4|4/4 Two-Seater and Four-Seater]]\n* 1950\u20131969 [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 1964\u20131967 [[Morgan +4+|Plus 4 Plus]]\n* 1965-1967 [[Morgan +4#Competition use|Morgan +4 Competition two seater]]\n* 1968\u20132004 (and 2012\u201319) [[Morgan Plus 8|Plus 8]]\n* 1985\u20132000 [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 2001\u20132009 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero 8]]\n* 2004\u20132012 [[Morgan Roadster|V6 Roadster]]\n* 2005\u2013present [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 2006\u2013pending [[Morgan LIFEcar]]\n* 2008\u20132009 [[Morgan Aero 8|AeroMax]]\n* 2009\u2013present [[Morgan 4/4 Sport]]\n* 2010\u20132015 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero SuperSports]]\n* 2010\u2013cancelled [[Morgan Eva GT]]\n* 2011\u2013cancelled [[Morgan Plus E]]\n* 2011\u20132012 [[Morgan Plus 4 Supersports]]\n* 2011\u2013present [[Morgan Anniversary 4/4]]\n* 2012\u20132015 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero Coupe]]\n* 2012\u2013present [[Morgan 3-Wheeler]]\n* 2012\u201319 [[Morgan Aero 8]]\n* 2012\u2013present [[Morgan Roadster|Roadster 3.7]]\n* 2015\u201319 [[Morgan Aero 8]]\n* 2018 Morgan EV3<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.morgan-motor.co.uk/ev3/|title=EV3|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n* 2019\u2013present [[Morgan Plus Six]]\n\n== Motorsports ==\nMorgan cars can be found in many areas of motorsport, from club and historic racing to more prominent examples, including the Le Mans 24hr race.
