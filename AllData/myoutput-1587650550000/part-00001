Malegaon is the second largest city of [[Nashik district]] after [[Nashik]] city and one of the largest cities in North Maharashtra.\n\n==History==\nMalegaon (previously Maligaon<ref name=mulligaum>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cyQDAAAAYAAJ|title=''A New and Comprehensive Gazetteer''|last1=Wright|first1=George Newenham|year=1837}} G.N. Wright, 1837. See entry for MULLIGAUM, p216.</ref>) at the confluence of the [[Mausam River|Mausam]] (previously Moosy<ref name=mulligaum/>) and [[Girna River|Girna]] rivers.\n\nOn the road linking Mumbai and Agra \u2014 now [[Indian highways|national highway]] No 3, NH3 \u2014 it used to be a small junction known as ''Maliwadi'' (hamlet of gardens). It quickly gained the reputation for being a source of employment in 1740 when a local jahagirdar, Naro Shankar Raje Bahadur, started building a fort in the area. As the fort took 25 years, a sizeable number of Muslim workers and artisans from places like Surat and northern India settled in the area.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nAfter the British capture of the [[Malegaon fort]] in 1818, Muslims from Hyderabad migrated to the region. The 1857 revolt saw many Muslims from the north move here, and the pattern repeated over the years. Malegaon, with its growing Muslim presence, became something of a shelter and a source of employment for the community whenever it faced reversals. If famine in 1862 forced Muslim weavers in the Varanasi area to move to Malegaon, the political upheavals in the Hyderabad of the late 1940s and 1950s saw a similar exodus to the town. Communal riots, specially from the 1960s onward, have undoubtedly contributed to swelling the number of Muslim migrants to Malegaon.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Geography==\nMalegaon is at the confluence of the Girna and Mausam rivers, at elevation of 438&nbsp;metres (1437&nbsp;feet) at {{Coord|18.42|N|77.53|E}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/16/Malegaon.html |title=Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Malegaon |publisher=Fallingrain.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}</ref>\n\nIt is 280&nbsp;km northeast of the state capital [[Mumbai]].

The era of power looms in the city emerged after 1935. Malegaon was a traditional handloom-weaving centre in Maharashtra. Most of the preparatory work before weaving like starching the yarn, transferring it over the tubes, and preparing tanabana was done by the women. Even after power looms were introduced, women continued to help men in the weaving procedure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nWith the introduction of power looms, the cloth industry in Malegaon flourished due to increased productivity. Many people bought power looms and very few were left with handlooms. It has an estimated 3 lakh power looms producing about 1 crore (10 million) meters of cloth every day. It attracts workers from around India, majority of migrants from U.P., Khandesh and Deccan, due to lower cost of living and Muslim dominance.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nIn recent times, the power loom industry is going through difficult phase due to factors like fluctuating government policies, frequent electricity outage, lack of political will, middleman at every stage and reluctance to migrate to advanced machines.<ref>Smriti Irani has taken charge as Textile Minister when the industry is in its worst phase http://ummid.com/news/2016/July/13.07.2016/smriti-irani-takes-charge-as-textile-minister.html</ref> Though it is still a major source of employment, most of workers struggle to make a living. As a result, the city has observed a change in migration pattern wherein the worker prefer to move to metros compared to Malegaon for better and stable job opportunities.\n\nMalegaon of late{{when|date=July 2019}} has been diversifying and new industries are rapidly expanding. PVC pipe manufacturing is one such industry. Malegaon is soon becoming a regional centre for PVC pipes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Mollywood film industry ===\n\nMalegaon's notoriously wacky film spoof industry has introduced many classic Hollywood and Bollywood characters to the satellite town of Malegaon by giving them its quintessential dialogue, looks, circumstances, and food. After having conquered local imagination with such cult spoofs as ''Malegaon ki Sholay'', ''Malegaon ke Karan arjun'', ''Malegaon ka James Bond'' and ''[[Supermen of Malegaon]],'' the impoverished film-maker{{who|date=February 2018}} invaded national television with his second version of ''[[Malegaon Ka Chintu]]'', ''Chintu ban gaya Gentleman'', a mute comedy based loosely on [[Mr. Bean]].\n\nA crew named Sky View Pictures in Malegaon produce and make movies. They have made several short films like ''Dillage'', ''Caller Tunes'', ''The Lost Lover'', and ''Independence''. The crew is currently working on their next feature film.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Jayesh Sonar |url=http://jayeshsonar2.wixsite.com/svfpmh41 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20161217195839/http://jayeshsonar2.wixsite.com/svfpmh41 |archivedate=17 December 2016 |title=Caller Tunes Official Trailer |url-status=live |accessdate=17 December 2016 }}</ref>\n\nMollywood artists work on daily wages. They earn a livelihood selling vegetables, working in the textile factories in Malegaon, or running eateries or tea stalls. In the credits their names reflect their professions, like Salim Electrician, Iqbal Chaiwala, badshah khan, or Zaheer Cyclewala. Since Mollywood films are not released all over India, they don't make much money. The urge to make the movies is almost always personal passion. ''Malegoan Ke Karan Arjun,'' for example, was made on a budget of Rs 50,000 and made around Rs 2.50 lakh.\n\nIn the early days of Mollywood, local actors from Malegaon were excited to work in film with no fees. Later it was a trend that actors were not paid for the work. Owner of \u201cADD Films\u201d production Atul Dusane was the first in Malegaon who started to pay actors, crew, and cast. Since then actors are being paid for the work.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe male actors are locals, Some of the biggest stars, such as superstar Sarthak Nagpal, jainya, shafique chotu, badshah khan, ramzan shahrukh. but Malegaon's conservative society does not allow local women to act in films, so actresses are mostly from Jalgaon.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Agriculture===\n\nVillages near Malegaon and towards Satana, Nampur Talwade and vadel are indulged into agriculture and major producers of [[onion]]s. [[Pomegranate]] is another crop of commercial importance that is cultivated by farmers in nearby pockets. Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) of Malegaon has a front office at Malegaon and research farm at Vadel.<ref>http://www.kvkmalegaon.org/home.html</ref> There is also a campus of Mahatma Gandhi Vidyamandir's H.

Malegaon is the second largest city of [[Nashik district]] after [[Nashik]] city and one of the largest cities in North Maharashtra.\n\n==History==\nMalegaon (previously Maligaon<ref name=mulligaum>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cyQDAAAAYAAJ|title=''A New and Comprehensive Gazetteer''|last1=Wright|first1=George Newenham|year=1837}} G.N. Wright, 1837. See entry for MULLIGAUM, p216.</ref>) at the confluence of the [[Mausam River|Mausam]] (previously Moosy<ref name=mulligaum/>) and [[Girna River|Girna]] rivers.\n\nOn the road linking Mumbai and Agra \u2014 now [[Indian highways|national highway]] No 3, NH3 \u2014 it used to be a small junction known as ''Maliwadi'' (hamlet of gardens). It quickly gained the reputation for being a source of employment in 1740 when a local jahagirdar, Naro Shankar Raje Bahadur, started building a fort in the area. As the fort took 25 years, a sizeable number of Muslim workers and artisans from places like Surat and northern India settled in the area.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nAfter the British capture of the [[Malegaon fort]] in 1818, Muslims from Hyderabad migrated to the region. The 1857 revolt saw many Muslims from the north move here, and the pattern repeated over the years. Malegaon, with its growing Muslim presence, became something of a shelter and a source of employment for the community whenever it faced reversals. If famine in 1862 forced Muslim weavers in the Varanasi area to move to Malegaon, the political upheavals in the Hyderabad of the late 1940s and 1950s saw a similar exodus to the town. Communal riots, specially from the 1960s onward, have undoubtedly contributed to swelling the number of Muslim migrants to Malegaon.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Geography==\nMalegaon is at the confluence of the Girna and Mausam rivers, at elevation of 438&nbsp;metres (1437&nbsp;feet) at {{Coord|18.42|N|77.53|E}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/16/Malegaon.html |title=Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Malegaon |publisher=Fallingrain.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}</ref>\n\nIt is 280&nbsp;km northeast of the state capital [[Mumbai]].

The era of power looms in the city emerged after 1935. Malegaon was a traditional handloom-weaving centre in Maharashtra. Most of the preparatory work before weaving like starching the yarn, transferring it over the tubes, and preparing tanabana was done by the women. Even after power looms were introduced, women continued to help men in the weaving procedure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nWith the introduction of power looms, the cloth industry in Malegaon flourished due to increased productivity. Many people bought power looms and very few were left with handlooms. It has an estimated 3 lakh power looms producing about 1 crore (10 million) meters of cloth every day. It attracts workers from around India, majority of migrants from U.P., Khandesh and Deccan, due to lower cost of living and Muslim dominance.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nIn recent times, the power loom industry is going through difficult phase due to factors like fluctuating government policies, frequent electricity outage, lack of political will, middleman at every stage and reluctance to migrate to advanced machines.<ref>Smriti Irani has taken charge as Textile Minister when the industry is in its worst phase http://ummid.com/news/2016/July/13.07.2016/smriti-irani-takes-charge-as-textile-minister.html</ref> Though it is still a major source of employment, most of workers struggle to make a living. As a result, the city has observed a change in migration pattern wherein the worker prefer to move to metros compared to Malegaon for better and stable job opportunities.\n\nMalegaon of late{{when|date=July 2019}} has been diversifying and new industries are rapidly expanding. PVC pipe manufacturing is one such industry. Malegaon is soon becoming a regional centre for PVC pipes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Mollywood film industry ===\n\nMalegaon's notoriously wacky film spoof industry has introduced many classic Hollywood and Bollywood characters to the satellite town of Malegaon by giving them its quintessential dialogue, looks, circumstances, and food. After having conquered local imagination with such cult spoofs as ''Malegaon ki Sholay'', ''Malegaon ke Karan arjun'', ''Malegaon ka James Bond'' and ''[[Supermen of Malegaon]],'' the impoverished film-maker{{who|date=February 2018}} invaded national television with his second version of ''[[Malegaon Ka Chintu]]'', ''Chintu ban gaya Gentleman'', a mute comedy based loosely on [[Mr. Bean]].\n\nA crew named Sky View Pictures in Malegaon produce and make movies. They have made several short films like ''Dillage'', ''Caller Tunes'', ''The Lost Lover'', and ''Independence''. The crew is currently working on their next feature film.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Jayesh Sonar |url=http://jayeshsonar2.wixsite.com/svfpmh41 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20161217195839/http://jayeshsonar2.wixsite.com/svfpmh41 |archivedate=17 December 2016 |title=Caller Tunes Official Trailer |url-status=live |accessdate=17 December 2016 }}</ref>\n\nMollywood artists work on daily wages. They earn a livelihood selling vegetables, working in the textile factories in Malegaon, or running eateries or tea stalls. In the credits their names reflect their professions, like Salim Electrician, Iqbal Chaiwala, badshah khan, or Zaheer Cyclewala. Since Mollywood films are not released all over India, they don't make much money. The urge to make the movies is almost always personal passion. ''Malegoan Ke Karan Arjun,'' for example, was made on a budget of Rs 50,000 and made around Rs 2.50 lakh.\n\nIn the early days of Mollywood, local actors from Malegaon were excited to work in film with no fees. Later it was a trend that actors were not paid for the work. Owner of \u201cADD Films\u201d production Atul Dusane was the first in Malegaon who started to pay actors, crew, and cast. Since then actors are being paid for the work.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe male actors are locals, Some of the biggest stars, such as superstar Sarthak Nagpal, jainya, shafique chotu, badshah khan, ramzan shahrukh. but Malegaon's conservative society does not allow local women to act in films, so actresses are mostly from Jalgaon.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Agriculture===\n\nVillages near Malegaon and towards Satana, Nampur Talwade and vadel are indulged into agriculture and major producers of [[onion]]s. [[Pomegranate]] is another crop of commercial importance that is cultivated by farmers in nearby pockets.
