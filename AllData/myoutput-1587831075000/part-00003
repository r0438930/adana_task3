Understandably, many believe this because of depictions of such raindrops on [[weather channel]]s.\n\nIn the past few years, hypercorrection research has focused on the factors behind it and whether people of all ages exhibit this phenomenon. There has been evidence that surprise or embarrassment of getting the answer wrong has an important role in hypercorrection. As people fear from being made fun of for answering a general knowledge question incorrectly, they will be more likely to remember a confident mistake they had made once. For example, a person suggests that [[scallop]]s come from trees. This person's friends laugh, pointing out that scallops come from the ocean. Embarrassed that the response was incorrect, the person makes sure to remember this fact to avoid embarrassment.\n\nAnother factor implicated in hypercorrection is that there will be more vocabulary or knowledge used about answers that the individual is certain of instead of unsure about,possibly implying that people are more familiar with the answers they are confident with.

The experimenters delivered a questionnaire to the participants and recorded brain activities using fMRI, while correcting incorrect answers. It was discovered that while participants received their correction after committing a mistake, the brain was showing activation of the Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) which indicates that they were entertaining the original false belief as well as the true belief.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00228|title=Neural Correlates of People's Hypercorrection of Their False Beliefs|year=2012|last1=Metcalfe|first1=Janet|last2=Butterfield|first2=Brady|last3=Habeck|first3=Christian|last4=Stern|first4=Yaakov|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=24|issue=7|pages=1571\u20131583|pmid=22452558|pmc=3970786}}</ref>\n\nBecause the hypercorrection effect is all about our knowledge, knowledge errors, and their effects on our correction of knowledge errors, it seems likely that this effect will have been studied in genuine classroom settings. Yet, hypercorrection effects have mostly been studied by observation only of past scenarios. This effect has mostly been studied only in typical laboratory settings. A study done by Carpenter, Haynes, Corral, and Yeung (2018) is one of the first times this effect has been studied in an authentic educational context. This study was conducted in a university\u2019s introductory horticulture class. The students in this class were first presented with questionnaires related to the educational content of that course. They were then presented with the correct answers and were later given a post-test to test the same information in the same way once again. When analyzing the test results, the researchers determined that a powerful hypercorrection effect was present. In analyzing these results, the researchers found that students who had a higher previous knowledge and understanding of the material not only showed a higher confidence in their original answers but also exhibited a much more prevalent and more impressive hypercorrection effect of their inaccurate answers. We see from this and the other studies mentioned that a higher general knowledge of the topic seems to also bring along with it a more potent hypercorrection effect.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/09658211.2018.1477164|title=Hypercorrection of high-confidence errors in the classroom|year=2018|last1=Carpenter|first1=Shana K.|last2=Haynes|first2=Cynthia L.|last3=Corral|first3=Daniel|last4=Yeung|first4=Kam Leung|journal=Memory|volume=26|issue=10|pages=1379\u20131384|pmid=29781391}}</ref>\n\nJanet Metcalfe (2017) explores the effect and possible repercussions of not using this hypercorrection effect to our advantage in the classroom. In an annual psychology review she wrote on this topic; she explains how focusing solely on avoiding errors completely before testing in the classroom may actually be a disadvantageous method of teaching and learning. This claim is made only for neurologically typical students. Metcalfe even goes as far to say that it may actually be a beneficial practice for students in education to commit and correct errors while in low-stakes situations as a method of coming to learn and understand the given material more unshakably.<ref name=\"Metcalfe 2017\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-010416-044022|title=Learning from Errors|year=2017|last1=Metcalfe|first1=Janet|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=68|pages=465\u2013489|pmid=27648988|doi-access=free}}</ref> In addition to the benefits of making errors to the learners, Metcalfe also claims that the process of hearing the errors and correcting them can be helpful for the teachers: Aside from the direct benefit to learners, teachers gain valuable information from errors, and error tolerance encourages students\u2019 active, exploratory, generative engagement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Metcalfe|first=Janet|date=2017-01-03|title=Learning from Errors|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-010416-044022?fbclid=IwAR00aS_TBEkCKQ9IMw0rNJVnLzgQFkapTRHOIN-y583frBU8TFc5XtydwH0|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=465\u2013489|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-010416-044022|issn=0066-4308}}</ref> This adds another beneficial aspect of hypercorrection in education, further proving the importance of the theory.\n\n==Hypercorrection and age==\n\nThere have been implications that age plays a role within the hypercorrection effect, after research showed that not all people showed this effect. Most studies in the past have asked young adults to answer general knowledge questions. Recently, older adults have been tested and have not shown the hypercorrection effect, though this does not provide definitive evidence to state that older adults cannot exhibit this phenomenon.<ref name=\"Eich 2013\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13825585.2012.754399|title=The hypercorrection effect in younger and older adults|year=2013|last1=Eich|first1=Teal S.|last2=Stern|first2=Yaakov|last3=Metcalfe|first3=Janet|journal=Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition|volume=20|issue=5|pages=511\u2013521|pmid=23241028|pmc=3604148}}</ref> However, whether older adults are better at correcting knowledge they are unsure about or they are worse at hypercorrection is still to be determined.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Casal-Roscum|first2=L.|last3=Radin|first3=A.|last4=Friedman|first4=D.|title=On Teaching Old Dogs New Tricks|journal=Psychological Science|date=2015|doi=10.1177/0956797615597912|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1833\u20131842|pmid=26494598|pmc=4679660}}</ref> The result for children are not concrete, but some say that the [[prefrontal cortex]], a part of the brain that is crucial to memory, is important for the hypercorrection effect. This would be a plausible explanation since elders may have impaired prefrontal cortices and children's may be underdeveloped.\n\nIn speaking about the difference in hypercorrection\u2019s effects relative to age, we learn from Metcalfe, Stern, and Eich (2014) that while older adults were seen to do a better job with general test accuracy, they had a low occurrence of the hypercorrection effect while younger adults were shown to display this phenomenon more frequently.<ref name=\"Eich 2013\"/> However, the researchers found out later that this was not because of a problem with their memory and processing mechanisms of older people. They tend to hypercorrect less, because older adults tended to correct ''all'' of their errors rather than just focusing on high-confidence errors.<ref name=\"Metcalfe 1833\u20131842\">{{Cite journal|last=Metcalfe|first=Janet|last2=Casal-Roscum|first2=Lindsey|last3=Radin|first3=Arielle|last4=Friedman|first4=David|date=December 2015|title=On Teaching Old Dogs New Tricks|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4679660/|journal=Psychological science|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1833\u20131842|doi=10.1177/0956797615597912|issn=0956-7976|pmc=4679660|pmid=26494598}}</ref> Although this finding raises another question regarding the learning abilities of older adults, if they are so better at focusing on all errors they make than young people, how is it harder to learn at an older age? The researchers suggest that their experiment, that was conducted [[in vitro]] with factual pieces of information, can have a different outcome than real life, since older adults could be particularly motivated to learn the truth, and capable of engaging their attention to this end.<ref name=\"Metcalfe 1833\u20131842\"/> However, this suggestion remains unexplored in the field and needs further research to be proven.\n\n== Problems ==\nA research conducted by Andrew Butler, Lisa Fazio and Elizabeth Marsh found out that high-confidence errors are more likely to be corrected, but they are also more likely to be reproduced if the correct answer is forgotten.<ref name=\"Butler 1238\u20131244\">{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Andrew C.|last2=Fazio|first2=Lisa K.|last3=Marsh|first3=Elizabeth J.|date=2011-12-01|title=The hypercorrection effect persists over a week, but high-confidence errors return|url=https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-011-0173-y|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review|language=en|volume=18|issue=6|pages=1238\u20131244|doi=10.3758/s13423-011-0173-y|issn=1531-5320}}</ref> For the research, subjects were presented with general knowledge questions and asked about their confidence levels for their answers, as the wrong answers were corrected afterwards. Half of the subjects were asked the same question right after the test, while the other half were asked a week later. The research showed that after an initial period of one week, subjects were less likely to remember the answers to the same general knowledge questions correctly. Even more importantly, high-confidence errors were more likely than low-confidence errors to be reproduced on the delayed test.<ref name=\"Butler 1238\u20131244\"/> The findings suggest an important fact about hyperorrection: high-confidence errors are more likely to be corrected, but they are also more likely to be reproduced if the correct answer is forgotten,<ref name=\"Butler 1238\u20131244\"/> especially after a period of time.\n\n==Recent developments==\nThe hypercorrection effect has been demonstrated and replicated in several settings and with many different types of participants in recent years. Metcalfe, J., & Miele, D. B. (2014).

Recently, older adults have been tested and have not shown the hypercorrection effect, though this does not provide definitive evidence to state that older adults cannot exhibit this phenomenon.<ref name=\"Eich 2013\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13825585.2012.754399|title=The hypercorrection effect in younger and older adults|year=2013|last1=Eich|first1=Teal S.|last2=Stern|first2=Yaakov|last3=Metcalfe|first3=Janet|journal=Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition|volume=20|issue=5|pages=511\u2013521|pmid=23241028|pmc=3604148}}</ref> However, whether older adults are better at correcting knowledge they are unsure about or they are worse at hypercorrection is still to be determined.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Casal-Roscum|first2=L.|last3=Radin|first3=A.|last4=Friedman|first4=D.|title=On Teaching Old Dogs New Tricks|journal=Psychological Science|date=2015|doi=10.1177/0956797615597912|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1833\u20131842|pmid=26494598|pmc=4679660}}</ref> The result for children are not concrete, but some say that the [[prefrontal cortex]], a part of the brain that is crucial to memory, is important for the hypercorrection effect. This would be a plausible explanation since elders may have impaired prefrontal cortices and children's may be underdeveloped.\n\nIn speaking about the difference in hypercorrection\u2019s effects relative to age, we learn from Metcalfe, Stern, and Eich (2014) that while older adults were seen to do a better job with general test accuracy, they had a low occurrence of the hypercorrection effect while younger adults were shown to display this phenomenon more frequently.<ref name=\"Eich 2013\"/> However, the researchers found out later that this was not because of a problem with their memory and processing mechanisms of older people. They tend to hypercorrect less, because older adults tended to correct ''all'' of their errors rather than just focusing on high-confidence errors.<ref name=\"Metcalfe 1833\u20131842\">{{Cite journal|last=Metcalfe|first=Janet|last2=Casal-Roscum|first2=Lindsey|last3=Radin|first3=Arielle|last4=Friedman|first4=David|date=December 2015|title=On Teaching Old Dogs New Tricks|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4679660/|journal=Psychological science|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1833\u20131842|doi=10.1177/0956797615597912|issn=0956-7976|pmc=4679660|pmid=26494598}}</ref> Althouh this finding raises another question regarding the learning abilities of older adults, if they are so better at focusing on all errors they make than young people, how is it harder to learn at an older age? The researchers suggest that their experiment, that was conducted [[in vitro]] with factual pieces of information, can have a different outcome than real life, since older adults could be particularly motivated to learn the truth, and capable of engaging their attention to this end.<ref name=\"Metcalfe 1833\u20131842\"/> However, this suggestion remains unexplored in the field and needs further research to be proven.\n\n== Problems ==\nA research conducted by Andrew Butler, Lisa Fazio and Elizabeth Marsh found out that high-confidence errors are more likely to be corrected, but they are also more likely to be reproduced if the correct answer is forgotten.<ref name=\"Butler 1238\u20131244\">{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Andrew C.|last2=Fazio|first2=Lisa K.|last3=Marsh|first3=Elizabeth J.|date=2011-12-01|title=The hypercorrection effect persists over a week, but high-confidence errors return|url=https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-011-0173-y|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review|language=en|volume=18|issue=6|pages=1238\u20131244|doi=10.3758/s13423-011-0173-y|issn=1531-5320}}</ref> For the research, subjects were presented with general knowledge questions and asked about their confidence levels for their answers, as the wrong answers were corrected afterwards. Half of the subjects were asked the same question right after the test, while the other half were asked a week later. The research showed that after an initial period of one week, subjects were less likely to remember the answers to the same general knowledge questions correctly. Even more importantly, high-confidence errors were more likely than low-confidence errors to be reproduced on the delayed test.<ref name=\"Butler 1238\u20131244\"/> The findings suggest an important fact about hyperorrection: high-confidence errors are more likely to be corrected, but they are also more likely to be reproduced if the correct answer is forgotten,<ref name=\"Butler 1238\u20131244\"/> especially after a period of time.\n\n==Recent developments==\nThe hypercorrection effect has been demonstrated and replicated in several settings and with many different types of participants in recent years. Metcalfe, J., & Miele, D. B. (2014). Hypercorrection of high confidence errors: Prior testing both enhances delayed performance and blocks the return of the errors.<ref name=\"Metcalfe 2014\"/> The hypercorrection effect was tested with participants from the general population but was also demonstrated with a group of children with autism spectrum disorder.<ref name=\"Williams 2016\"/> Though those tested with autism spectrum disorder had a significantly weaker general metacognitive ability than previous participants without any mental disorders, they did not show any evidence of a weakened hypercorrection effect. Thus, the hypercorrection effect is seen by many to be completely disconnected from general metacognitive ability and is a phenomenon common among us all.<ref name=\"Williams 2016\">{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=David M|last2=Bergstr\u00f6m|first2=Zara|last3=Grainger|first3=Catherine|date=2016-12-15|title=Metacognitive monitoring and the hypercorrection effect in autism and the general population: Relation to autism(-like) traits and mindreading|journal=Autism|language=en-US|volume=22|issue=3|pages=259\u2013270|doi=10.1177/1362361316680178|pmid=29671645|issn=1362-3613|url=https://kar.kent.ac.uk/58824/1/Wiliams%2C%20Bergstrom%2C%20and%20Grainger%202016.%20Hypercorrection.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Educational research]]\n[[Category:Memory processes]]\n[[Category:Cognitive psychology]]\n", "name_user": "Geysirhead", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHypercorrection and age", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercorrection_(psychology)"}
