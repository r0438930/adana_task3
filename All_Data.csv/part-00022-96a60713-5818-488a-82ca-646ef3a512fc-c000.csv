'''Fanny Mendelssohn''' (14 November 1805 – 14 May 1847),<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> later '''Fanny [Cäcilie] Mendelssohn Bartholdy''' and, after her marriage, '''Fanny Hensel''', was a German composer and pianist from the [[Romantic era]]. She grew up in Berlin, Germany, and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to the reservations of her family, and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had their only child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.

She composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 [[Lied|Lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. Since the 1990s her life and works have been the subject of more detailed research. Her ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' was inaccurately credited to her brother in 1970, before analysis of new documents in 2010 corrected the error.  

The [[Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum]] opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.

==Life==
=== Early life and education ===
[[File:Fannymendelssohn-improved.jpg|thumb|upright|Fanny Mendelssohn, sketched in 1829 by her future husband [[Wilhelm Hensel]]]]Mendelssohn was born in [[Hamburg]], the [[Mendelssohn family|oldest of four children]], including her brother Felix Mendelssohn born four years after her.<ref name=Grove>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> She was descended on both sides from distinguished [[Jewish]] families; her parents were [[Abraham Mendelssohn]] (who was the son of philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and later changed the family surname to Mendelssohn Bartholdy), and Lea, née Salomon, a granddaughter of the entrepreneur [[Daniel Itzig]].<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 3–5</ref> Her uncle was the banker [[Joseph Mendelssohn]]. She was baptised as a Christian in 1816, becoming Fanny Cäcilie Mendelssohn Bartholdy.<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Despite this, she and her family continued an affinity with the social and moral values of Judaism.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987), pp. xxix, 629</ref><ref>Citron (1994), p. 322</ref> Like her brother Felix, she objected strongly when their father Abraham changed the family surname to 'Mendelssohn Bartholdy' with the intention of playing down their Jewish origins: she wrote to Felix of  \"Bartholdy, that name which we all dislike.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) 1987, p. 66</ref>

While growing up in the family's new home in Berlin,<ref>Forney (2015), p. 278</ref> Mendelssohn showed prodigious musical ability and began to write music. She received her first piano instruction from her mother, who had learned the Berlin Bach tradition through the writings of [[Johann Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref>Todd (2010){{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Thus as a 14 year old, Mendelssohn could already play all 24 preludes from Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' from memory alone, and she did so in honour of her father's birthday in 1819.<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref> Beyond inspiration from her mother, Mendelssohn may also have been influenced by the role-models of her great-aunts [[Fanny von Arnstein]] and [[Itzig family#Sarah Itzig|Sarah Levy]], both lovers of music, the former the patroness of a well-known [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] and the latter a skilled keyboard player in her own right.<ref>Citron (1994), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> 

After studying briefly with the pianist [[Marie Bigot]] in Paris,<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received piano lessons from [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]] and composition instruction from [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]].<ref>Rogers (2011), p. 178</ref> At one point, Zelter favoured Fanny over Felix: he wrote to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1816, in a letter introducing Abraham Mendelssohn to the poet, \"He has adorable children and his oldest daughter could give you something of Sebastian Bach. This child is really something special.\"<ref>Conway (2011), 171</ref> Both Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received instruction in composition from Zelter starting in 1819. In 1820, they joined the [[Sing-Akademie zu Berlin]], which was led by Zelter at the time.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Much later, in an 1831 letter to Goethe, Zelter described Fanny's skill as a pianist with the highest praise for a woman at the time: \"She plays like a man.\"<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Visitors to the Mendelssohn household in the early 1820s, including [[Ignaz Moscheles]] and [[George Thomas Smart|Sir George Smart]], were equally impressed by both siblings.<ref>Conway (2011), p. 169</ref><ref>Smart (1907), pp. 173, 179</ref>

=== Gender and class limitations ===
In the words of the music historian Kristine Forney, at this period \"social assumptions about women long discouraged them from composing (and limited their public performances)\".<ref>Forney et al. (2015), page not given</ref> Such attitudes were shared by Mendelssohn's father, who was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. In 1820, he wrote to her, \"Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I p. 82</ref> Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote:
<blockquote>From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it.<ref>Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, 24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113</ref>  </blockquote>

The music historian Angela Mace Christian has written that Fanny Mendelssohn \"struggled her entire life with the conflicting impulses of authorship versus the social expectations for her high-class status[...]; her hesitation was variously a result of her dutiful attitude towards her father, her intense relationship with her brother, and her awareness of contemporary social thought on women in the public sphere.\"<ref name=Grove /> Felix's friend [[Henry Chorley]] wrote of Fanny: \"Had Madame Hensel been a poor man's daughter, she must have become known to the world by the side of [[Clara Schumann|Madame Schumann]] and [[Marie Pleyel|Madame Pleyel]] as a female pianist of the highest class\", suggesting that her social class was limiting for her career as well as her sex.<ref>Conway (2011) pp. 27–28</ref> 

The biography of the Mendelssohn family compiled from family documents by Fanny's son Sebastian Hensel<ref>Hensel (1884)</ref> has been construed by the musicologist Marian Kimber as intending to represent Fanny as having no aspirations to perform outside the private sphere.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 115</ref> However, the editor of Fanny's correpondence, [[Marcia Citron]], notes that Fanny's \"oft-reported longing for a professional music career is not supported by her ... diaries, which are somewhat surprising for how little they reveal about her musical life.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\">Kimber (2004), p.&nbsp;51</ref>

===Felix and Fanny===
[[ File:Mendelssohn Bartholdy 1821.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=|right|Felix Mendelssohn aged 12 (1821) by [[Carl Joseph Begas]]]]The siblings' bond was strengthened by their shared passion for music. Fanny's works were often played alongside her brother's at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organised by her father, and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 631</ref> In 1822, when Fanny was 17 and Felix 13, she wrote \"Up to the present moment I possess his {Felix's] unbounded confidence. I have watched the progress of his talent step by step, and may say I have contributed to his development. I have always been his only musical adviser, and he never writes down a thought before submitting it to my judgment.\"<ref>Hensel (1884), p. 117</ref>

In 1826/1827 Felix arranged with Fanny for some of her songs to be published under his name,<ref name=Hensel>Hensel (1884), II 168–71</ref> three in his Op. 8 collection<ref name=Todd175>Todd (2003), p. 175</ref> and three more in his Op. 9.<ref>Todd (2003), p. 224</ref> In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when [[Queen Victoria]], receiving Felix at [[Buckingham Palace]], expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, ''Italien'' (to words by [[Franz Grillparzer]]), which Felix confessed was by Fanny.<ref name=Hensel/><ref name=Todd175/>

There was a lifelong musical correspondence between the two. Fanny helped Felix by providing constructive criticism of pieces and projects, which he always considered very carefully.<ref>Reich (1991), p. 92</ref> Felix would rework pieces solely based on the suggestions she made, and nicknamed her \"Minerva\" after the [[Minerva|Roman goddess of wisdom]].<ref>Library of Congress (n.d.)</ref> Their correspondence of 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios for an opera on the subject of the [[Nibelungenlied]]: Fanny wrote \"The hunt with Siegfried's death provides a splendid finale to the second act.\"<ref>Letter of 9 December 1840. See Fanny Mendelssohn (1987), pp. 299–301</ref>

=== Marriage and later life===
[[File:Wilhelm Hensel - Selbstbildnis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Wilhelm Hensel: Self-portrait (1829)]]In 1829, after a courtship of several years (they had first met in 1821 when she was 16),<ref name=Grove /> Fanny married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]], and the following year had her only child, {{ill|Sebastian Hensel|de|Sebastian Hensel (Landwirt)|lt=Sebastian Ludwig Felix Hensel}}.<ref>Todd (2003), pp. 219, 230</ref> She later had at least two miscarriages or stillbirths, in 1832 and 1837.<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />

In 1830 came her first public notice as a composer, when John Thomson, who had met her in Berlin the previous year, wrote in the London journal ''[[The Harmonicon]]'' in praise of a number of her songs that had been shown to him by Felix.<ref>Gates (2006), p. 7</ref> Her public debut at the piano (one of only three known public performances according to Mendelssohn scholar R. Larry Todd)<ref>Todd (2010), p. x</ref> came in 1838, when she played her brother's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Piano Concerto No. 1]].<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. xxiv</ref> 

Wilhelm Hensel, like Felix, was supportive of Fanny's composing, but unlike many others of her circle was also in favour of her seeking publication of her works.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 116</ref><ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" /><ref>Reich (1991), p. 95.</ref> The historian [[Nancy B. Reich]] has suggested two events which may have increased her confidence.  One was her visit to Italy with her husband and Sebastian in 1839–40. This was her first visit to the South and she felt invigorated and inspired; they also spent time with young French musicians who had won the [[Prix de Rome]] (one was the young [[Charles Gounod]]) and whose respect for Fanny powered her self-esteem as a musician. The other event was her acquaintance shortly afterwards with the Berlin critic Robert von Keudell; in her diary she wrote: \"Keudell looks at everything new that I write with the greatest interest, and points out to me if there is something to be corrected [...] He has always given me the very best counsel.\"<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 95–6</ref> 

[[File:Fannyhenselgrave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Grave of Fanny Hensel in Berlin]]In 1846, she decided, after an approach by two Berlin publishers,<ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, p. 325</ref> and without consulting Felix, to publish a collection of her songs (as her Op. 1).<ref>Citron, (1994)</ref> After publication, Felix wrote to her \"[I] send you my professional blessing on becoming a member of the craft [...] may you have much happiness in giving pleasure to others; may you taste only the sweets and none of the bitterness of authorship; may the public pelt you with roses, and never with sand.\" (12 August 1846). On 14 August Fanny wrote in her journal \"Felix has written, and given me his professional blessing in the kindest manner. I know that he is not quite satisfied in his heart of hearts, but I am glad he has said a kind word to me about it.\" <ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, pp. 325–326</ref> She also wrote about the publication to her friend Angelica von Woringen: \"I can truthfully say that I let it happen more than made it happen, and it is this in particular which cheers me [...] If [the publishers] want more from me, it should act as a stimulus to achieve. If the matter comes to an end then, I also won't grieve, for I'm not ambitious.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />

===Death===
Throughout March 1847 Fanny had many visits from [[Clara Schumann]]. At this time Fanny was working on her Piano Trio Op. 11 and Clara had recently completed her own Piano Trio (Op. 17), which she may have intended to dedicate to Fanny.<ref name=Grove /> 

On 14 May 1847 Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel died in Berlin of complications from a stroke suffered while rehearsing one of her brother's [[Cantata|cantatas]], ''[[Die erste Walpurgisnacht|The First Walpurgis Night]]''.<ref>Todd (2002), p. 557</ref> Felix himself died less than six months later from the same cause (which was also responsible for the deaths of both of their parents and their grandfather Moses),<ref>Sterndale Bennett (1955) 376</ref> but not before completing his [[String Quartet No. 6 (Mendelssohn)|String Quartet No. 6 in F minor]], written in memory of his sister.<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 348–349</ref>

== Compositions ==
{{see also|List of compositions by Fanny Mendelssohn}}
[[File:April (Fanny Hensel, Das Jahr).jpg|thumb|left|''April'' from the manuscript of Fanny Hensel's ''Das Jahr'' (illustration by Wilhelm Hensel)]] 
Fanny Mendelssohn composed over 460 pieces of music.<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> Her compositions include a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and an excess of 250 Lieder (German art songs).<ref>Forney (2014), p. 278</ref>A number of her songs were originally published under Felix's name in his [[opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections.<ref>Song (2016), pp. 2–3</ref> Her piano works are often in the manner of songs, and many carry the name ''Lied für Klavier (Song for Piano)'', analagous to Felix's ''Lieder ohne Worte ([[Songs Without Words]])''. This style of piano music was most successfully developed by Felix, whose first set (Op. 19b) appeared in 1829–30, with a second set (Op.30) appearing in 1833–34. Fanny's sets of ''Lieder für Klavier'' were written in the period 1836–1837, at about the same time as Felix's set Op. 38.<ref name=Mace118>Mace (2013) p. 118</ref><ref>Song (2016), pp. 5–7</ref>

[[File:IMSLP99178-PMLP194743-Hensel Fanny Sechs Lieder fuer eine Stimme mit Begleitung des Pianoforte Op 1 Bote 1046 1846 p 1pdf.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Title page of first edition of Fanny Hensel's Op. 1, 1846]]The majority of Fanny Mendelssohn's compositions are limited to lieder and piano pieces as she felt her abilities did not extend to larger, more intricate compositions. She was also undoubtedly hampered by the fact that, unlike her brother, she had never studied or played any string instruments, experience which would have assisted her in writing chamber or orchestral works.<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 93–4</ref> After completing her string quartet, she wrote to Felix in 1835, \"I lack the ability to sustain ideas properly and give them the needed consistency. Therefore lieder suit me best, in which, if need be, merely a pretty idea without much potential for development can suffice.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 174.</ref> She was an early example of women composers of a string quartet; she had also earlier written, with the assistance of Zelter, a [[piano quartet]] in 1822 (her first large-scale work), and, despite her reservations in her letter to Felix, she wrote in her last year a [[piano trio]] (Op. 11).<ref name=Grove /><ref>Todd (2003), pp. 104, 542–544</ref> Amongst her works is the ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' written in 1828, which was unpublished in her lifetime, then discovered and attributed to her brother in 1970, before examination of the manuscript and a mention of the work in her diary finally established in 2010 that the work was hers.<ref>Hawkins (2017)</ref> It was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>

She also composed in 1841 a cycle of pieces depicting the months of the year, ''Das Jahr'' (The Year).<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> The music was written on tinted sheets of paper and illustrated by her husband Wilhelm, with each piece accompanied by a short poem.{{refn|See {{IMSLP|work=Das Jahr, H.385 (Hensel, Fanny)|cname=''Das Jahr''}}|group=n}} The writer Kristine Forney has suggested that the poems, artwork and coloured paper may represent the different stages of life, with some suggesting they represent Mendelssohn's life.<ref>Forney (2014), p. 177</ref> In a letter from Rome, Fanny described the process behind composing ''Das Jahr'':<blockquote>I have been composing a good deal lately, and have called my piano pieces after the names of my favourite haunts, partly because they really came into my mind at these spots, partly because our pleasant excursions were in my mind while I was writing them. They will form a delightful souvenir, a kind of second diary. But do not imagine that I give these names when playing them in society, they are for home use entirely.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Style and form ===
[[File:Julius Eduard Wilhelm Helfft - The Music Room of Fanny Hensel (nee Mendelssohn) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Fanny Hensel's music room in the Hensel house, Leipziger Str. 3, Berlin]] Angela Mace, the musicologist who proved Fanny Hensel's authorship of the ''Easter Sonata'', considers that Fanny was much more experimental with her lieder than Felix, noting that her works have a \"harmonic density\" that serves to express emotion.<ref>Mace (2013) p. 10</ref> 

R. Larry Todd has pointed out that, although there has been much comment about the influence of Felix's music on Fanny (and some comment on that of Fanny on Felix), both were strongly influenced by the later music of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in terms of [[ musical form|form]], [[tonality]] and [[fugue|fugal]] [[counterpoint]].<ref>Todd (2010), p. 182</ref>. This is reflected for example in Fanny's string quartet.<ref>Song (2016), p. 1</ref>

Musicologist Stephen Rodgers has claimed that the relative lack of analysis of Fanny Mendelssohn's music has left the presence of triple [[hypermeter]] in her songs mostly overlooked. He points to this type of meter being used by Mendelssohn to alter the speed of vocals in the song and to reflect emotions through distortion of duple norms.<ref>Rogers (2011b), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> He also points to a lack of [[tonic (music)|tonic]] harmony as a recurring characteristic of her lieder, identifying it in the lied ''Verlust'' as a deliberate means to reflect the song's themes of abandonment and failing to find love. Mendelssohn's use of [[word painting]] is also acknowledged as a common element of her style, a method of stressing emotion in the song text.<ref>Rogers (2011a), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> She commonly used [[strophic form]] for her songs, and her piano accompaniments frequently doubled the voice-line, characteristics also of the music of her teachers Zelter and Berger.<ref>Draper (2012), p. 87</ref> Though the foundation created by her teachers would remain, Rodgers suggests that she increasingly turned to [[through-composed]] forms as her style developed, as a way to respond to elements of poetic text.<ref>Rogers (2011b) p. 201</ref>

==Legacy==
===Museum===
The Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum, which is dedicated to the lives and work of Fanny Mendelssohn and her brother Felix, opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.<ref>KomponistenQuartier (n.d.)</ref>

===Music===
In the six months before his death, Felix attempted to ensure that his sister received the recognition that had been withheld throughout most of her life by collecting many of her works with the intent of releasing them to the public through his publisher, [[Breitkopf & Härtel]]. In 1850, the publisher began to distribute Fanny Mendelssohn's unreleased works, starting with ''Vier Lieder'' Op. 8.<ref>Todd (2010), p. 351</ref>

In recent{{when|date=April 2020}} years, Fanny Mendelssohn's music has become better known thanks to concert performances and a number of CDs being released on labels such as [[Hyperion Records|Hyperion]] and [[Classic Produktion Osnabrück|CPO]].{{cn|date=April 2020}} Her ''Easter Sonata'' for piano, formerly attributed to Felix, was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>

===Writings===
Fanny Mendelssohn published no writings during her lifetime. Selected letters and journal entries were published during the nineteenth century, notably by Sebastian Hensel in his book on the Mendelssohn family. Her collected letters to Felix, edited by Marcia Citron, were published in 1987.<ref name=Grove /><ref>Hensel (1884)</ref><ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) 1987</ref>

===Biographical and musicological studies===
During the 19th century Fanny mainly figured as a bystander in biographes and studies of her brother Felix; typically she was a representative of a supposed 'feminizing' influence that sapped his artistry.<ref>Kimber (2004), pp. 48-49</ref> In the 20th century the conventional narrative switched to presenting Felix as disapproving of his sister's musical activities and seeking to contain them, whilst the 'feminizing' accusation against Fanny evaporated.<ref>Kimber (2004), pp. 49-50</ref> From the 1980s onwards Fanny Hensel Mendelssohn has been the subject of many academic books and articles.<ref>See bibliography in Mace Christian (2018)</ref>{{Sfnp|Stokes|2019}} Kimber opines that \"The tale of Fanny, the \"supressed\" composer, has so readily found as place in the biographies of the siblings because of its resemblance to prevailing models  for the life of a 'Great Composer' [...] based in Romantic ideology about male artists [...] Hensel fits neatly into a traditonal narrative of the suffering artistic genius[...] with a modern twist: the feminine gender of its main character. Thus two characters [Felix and Fanny] are forced to bear the weight of two centuries of gender ideology.\"<ref>Kimber (2004), p. 52</ref>

'''Fanny Mendelssohn''' (14 November 1805 – 14 May 1847),<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> later '''Fanny [Cäcilie] Mendelssohn Bartholdy''' and, after her marriage, '''Fanny Hensel''', was a German composer and pianist from the [[Romantic era]]. She grew up in Berlin, Germany, and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to the reservations of her family, and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had their only child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.

She composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 [[Lied|Lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. Since the 1990s her life and works have been the subject of more detailed research. Her ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' was inaccurately credited to her brother in 1970, before analysis of new documents in 2010 corrected the error.  

The [[Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum]] opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.

==Life==
=== Early life and education ===
[[File:Fannymendelssohn-improved.jpg|thumb|upright|Fanny Mendelssohn, sketched in 1829 by her future husband [[Wilhelm Hensel]]]]Mendelssohn was born in [[Hamburg]], the [[Mendelssohn family|oldest of four children]], including her brother Felix Mendelssohn born four years after her.<ref name=Grove>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> She was descended on both sides from distinguished [[Jewish]] families; her parents were [[Abraham Mendelssohn]] (who was the son of philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and later changed the family surname to Mendelssohn Bartholdy), and Lea, née Salomon, a granddaughter of the entrepreneur [[Daniel Itzig]].<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 3–5</ref> Her uncle was the banker [[Joseph Mendelssohn]]. She was baptised as a Christian in 1816, becoming Fanny Cäcilie Mendelssohn Bartholdy.<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Despite this, she and her family continued an affinity with the social and moral values of Judaism.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987), pp. xxix, 629</ref><ref>Citron (1994), p. 322</ref> Like her brother Felix, she objected strongly when their father Abraham changed the family surname to 'Mendelssohn Bartholdy' with the intention of playing down their Jewish origins: she wrote to Felix of  \"Bartholdy, that name which we all dislike.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) 1987, p. 66</ref>

While growing up in the family's new home in Berlin,<ref>Forney (2015), p. 278</ref> Mendelssohn showed prodigious musical ability and began to write music. She received her first piano instruction from her mother, who had learned the Berlin Bach tradition through the writings of [[Johann Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref>Todd (2010){{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Thus as a 14 year old, Mendelssohn could already play all 24 preludes from Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' from memory alone, and she did so in honour of her father's birthday in 1819.<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref> Beyond inspiration from her mother, Mendelssohn may also have been influenced by the role-models of her great-aunts [[Fanny von Arnstein]] and [[Itzig family#Sarah Itzig|Sarah Levy]], both lovers of music, the former the patroness of a well-known [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] and the latter a skilled keyboard player in her own right.<ref>Citron (1994), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> 

After studying briefly with the pianist [[Marie Bigot]] in Paris,<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received piano lessons from [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]] and composition instruction from [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]].<ref>Rogers (2011), p. 178</ref> At one point, Zelter favoured Fanny over Felix: he wrote to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1816, in a letter introducing Abraham Mendelssohn to the poet, \"He has adorable children and his oldest daughter could give you something of Sebastian Bach. This child is really something special.\"<ref>Conway (2011), 171</ref> Both Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received instruction in composition from Zelter starting in 1819. In 1820, they joined the [[Sing-Akademie zu Berlin]], which was led by Zelter at the time.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Much later, in an 1831 letter to Goethe, Zelter described Fanny's skill as a pianist with the highest praise for a woman at the time: \"She plays like a man.\"<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Visitors to the Mendelssohn household in the early 1820s, including [[Ignaz Moscheles]] and [[George Thomas Smart|Sir George Smart]], were equally impressed by both siblings.<ref>Conway (2011), p. 169</ref><ref>Smart (1907), pp. 173, 179</ref>

=== Gender and class limitations ===
In the words of the music historian Kristine Forney, at this period \"social assumptions about women long discouraged them from composing (and limited their public performances)\".<ref>Forney et al. (2015), page not given</ref> Such attitudes were shared by Mendelssohn's father, who was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. In 1820, he wrote to her, \"Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I p. 82</ref> Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote:
<blockquote>From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it.<ref>Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, 24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113</ref>  </blockquote>

The music historian Angela Mace Christian has written that Fanny Mendelssohn \"struggled her entire life with the conflicting impulses of authorship versus the social expectations for her high-class status[...]; her hesitation was variously a result of her dutiful attitude towards her father, her intense relationship with her brother, and her awareness of contemporary social thought on women in the public sphere.\"<ref name=Grove /> Felix's friend [[Henry Chorley]] wrote of Fanny: \"Had Madame Hensel been a poor man's daughter, she must have become known to the world by the side of [[Clara Schumann|Madame Schumann]] and [[Marie Pleyel|Madame Pleyel]] as a female pianist of the highest class\", suggesting that her social class was limiting for her career as well as her sex.<ref>Conway (2011) pp. 27–28</ref> 

The biography of the Mendelssohn family compiled from family documents by Fanny's son Sebastian Hensel<ref>Hensel (1884)</ref> has been construed by the musicologist Marian Kimber as intending to represent Fanny as having no aspirations to perform outside the private sphere.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 115</ref> However, the editor of Fanny's correpondence, [[Marcia Citron]], notes that Fanny's \"oft-reported longing for a professional music career is not supported by her ... diaries, which are somewhat surprising for how little they reveal about her musical life.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\">Kimber (2004), p.&nbsp;51</ref>

===Felix and Fanny===
[[ File:Mendelssohn Bartholdy 1821.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=|right|Felix Mendelssohn aged 12 (1821) by [[Carl Joseph Begas]]]]The siblings' bond was strengthened by their shared passion for music. Fanny's works were often played alongside her brother's at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organised by her father, and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 631</ref> In 1822, when Fanny was 17 and Felix 13, she wrote \"Up to the present moment I possess his {Felix's] unbounded confidence. I have watched the progress of his talent step by step, and may say I have contributed to his development. I have always been his only musical adviser, and he never writes down a thought before submitting it to my judgment.\"<ref>Hensel (1884), p. 117</ref>

In 1826/1827 Felix arranged with Fanny for some of her songs to be published under his name,<ref name=Hensel>Hensel (1884), II 168–71</ref> three in his Op. 8 collection<ref name=Todd175>Todd (2003), p. 175</ref> and three more in his Op. 9.<ref>Todd (2003), p. 224</ref> In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when [[Queen Victoria]], receiving Felix at [[Buckingham Palace]], expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, ''Italien'' (to words by [[Franz Grillparzer]]), which Felix confessed was by Fanny.<ref name=Hensel/><ref name=Todd175/>

There was a lifelong musical correspondence between the two. Fanny helped Felix by providing constructive criticism of pieces and projects, which he always considered very carefully.<ref>Reich (1991), p. 92</ref> Felix would rework pieces solely based on the suggestions she made, and nicknamed her \"Minerva\" after the [[Minerva|Roman goddess of wisdom]].<ref>Library of Congress (n.d.)</ref> Their correspondence of 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios for an opera on the subject of the [[Nibelungenlied]]: Fanny wrote \"The hunt with Siegfried's death provides a splendid finale to the second act.\"<ref>Letter of 9 December 1840. See Fanny Mendelssohn (1987), pp. 299–301</ref>

=== Marriage and later life===
[[File:Wilhelm Hensel - Selbstbildnis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Wilhelm Hensel: Self-portrait (1829)]]In 1829, after a courtship of several years (they had first met in 1821 when she was 16),<ref name=Grove /> Fanny married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]], and the following year had her only child, {{ill|Sebastian Hensel|de|Sebastian Hensel (Landwirt)|lt=Sebastian Ludwig Felix Hensel}}.<ref>Todd (2003), pp. 219, 230</ref> She later had at least two miscarriages or stillbirths, in 1832 and 1837.<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />

In 1830 came her first public notice as a composer, when John Thomson, who had met her in Berlin the previous year, wrote in the London journal ''[[The Harmonicon]]'' in praise of a number of her songs that had been shown to him by Felix.<ref>Gates (2006), p. 7</ref> Her public debut at the piano (one of only three known public performances according to Mendelssohn scholar R. Larry Todd)<ref>Todd (2010), p. x</ref> came in 1838, when she played her brother's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Piano Concerto No. 1]].<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. xxiv</ref> 

Wilhelm Hensel, like Felix, was supportive of Fanny's composing, but unlike many others of her circle was also in favour of her seeking publication of her works.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 116</ref><ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" /><ref>Reich (1991), p. 95.</ref> The historian [[Nancy B. Reich]] has suggested two events which may have increased her confidence.  One was her visit to Italy with her husband and Sebastian in 1839–40. This was her first visit to the South and she felt invigorated and inspired; they also spent time with young French musicians who had won the [[Prix de Rome]] (one was the young [[Charles Gounod]]) and whose respect for Fanny powered her self-esteem as a musician. The other event was her acquaintance shortly afterwards with the Berlin critic Robert von Keudell; in her diary she wrote: \"Keudell looks at everything new that I write with the greatest interest, and points out to me if there is something to be corrected [...] He has always given me the very best counsel.\"<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 95–6</ref> 

[[File:Fannyhenselgrave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Grave of Fanny Hensel in Berlin]]In 1846, she decided, after an approach by two Berlin publishers,<ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, p. 325</ref> and without consulting Felix, to publish a collection of her songs (as her Op. 1).<ref>Citron, (1994)</ref> After publication, Felix wrote to her \"[I] send you my professional blessing on becoming a member of the craft [...] may you have much happiness in giving pleasure to others; may you taste only the sweets and none of the bitterness of authorship; may the public pelt you with roses, and never with sand.\" (12 August 1846). On 14 August Fanny wrote in her journal \"Felix has written, and given me his professional blessing in the kindest manner. I know that he is not quite satisfied in his heart of hearts, but I am glad he has said a kind word to me about it.\" <ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, pp. 325–326</ref> She also wrote about the publication to her friend Angelica von Woringen: \"I can truthfully say that I let it happen more than made it happen, and it is this in particular which cheers me [...] If [the publishers] want more from me, it should act as a stimulus to achieve. If the matter comes to an end then, I also won't grieve, for I'm not ambitious.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />

===Death===
Throughout March 1847 Fanny had many visits from [[Clara Schumann]]. At this time Fanny was working on her Piano Trio Op. 11 and Clara had recently completed her own Piano Trio (Op. 17), which she may have intended to dedicate to Fanny.<ref name=Grove /> 

On 14 May 1847 Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel died in Berlin of complications from a stroke suffered while rehearsing one of her brother's [[Cantata|cantatas]], ''[[Die erste Walpurgisnacht|The First Walpurgis Night]]''.<ref>Todd (2002), p. 557</ref> Felix himself died less than six months later from the same cause (which was also responsible for the deaths of both of their parents and their grandfather Moses),<ref>Sterndale Bennett (1955) 376</ref> but not before completing his [[String Quartet No. 6 (Mendelssohn)|String Quartet No. 6 in F minor]], written in memory of his sister.<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 348–349</ref>

== Compositions ==
{{see also|List of compositions by Fanny Mendelssohn}}
[[File:April (Fanny Hensel, Das Jahr).jpg|thumb|left|''April'' from the manuscript of Fanny Hensel's ''Das Jahr'' (illustration by Wilhelm Hensel)]] 
Fanny Mendelssohn composed over 460 pieces of music.<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> Her compositions include a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and an excess of 250 Lieder (German art songs).<ref>Forney (2014), p. 278</ref>A number of her songs were originally published under Felix's name in his [[opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections.<ref>Song (2016), pp. 2–3</ref> Her piano works are often in the manner of songs, and many carry the name ''Lied für Klavier (Song for Piano)'', analagous to Felix's ''Lieder ohne Worte ([[Songs Without Words]])''. This style of piano music was most successfully developed by Felix, whose first set (Op. 19b) appeared in 1829–30, with a second set (Op.30) appearing in 1833–34. Fanny's sets of ''Lieder für Klavier'' were written in the period 1836–1837, at about the same time as Felix's set Op. 38.<ref name=Mace118>Mace (2013) p. 118</ref><ref>Song (2016), pp. 5–7</ref>

[[File:IMSLP99178-PMLP194743-Hensel Fanny Sechs Lieder fuer eine Stimme mit Begleitung des Pianoforte Op 1 Bote 1046 1846 p 1pdf.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Title page of first edition of Fanny Hensel's Op. 1, 1846]]The majority of Fanny Mendelssohn's compositions are limited to lieder and piano pieces as she felt her abilities did not extend to larger, more intricate compositions. She was also undoubtedly hampered by the fact that, unlike her brother, she had never studied or played any string instruments, experience which would have assisted her in writing chamber or orchestral works.<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 93–4</ref> After completing her string quartet, she wrote to Felix in 1835, \"I lack the ability to sustain ideas properly and give them the needed consistency. Therefore lieder suit me best, in which, if need be, merely a pretty idea without much potential for development can suffice.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 174.</ref> She was an early example of women composers of a string quartet; she had also earlier written, with the assistance of Zelter, a [[piano quartet]] in 1822 (her first large-scale work), and, despite her reservations in her letter to Felix, she wrote in her last year a [[piano trio]] (Op. 11).<ref name=Grove /><ref>Todd (2003), pp. 104, 542–544</ref> Amongst her works is the ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' written in 1828, which was unpublished in her lifetime, then discovered and attributed to her brother in 1970, before examination of the manuscript and a mention of the work in her diary finally established in 2010 that the work was hers.<ref>Hawkins (2017)</ref> It was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>

She also composed in 1841 a cycle of pieces depicting the months of the year, ''Das Jahr'' (The Year).<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> The music was written on tinted sheets of paper and illustrated by her husband Wilhelm, with each piece accompanied by a short poem.{{refn|See {{IMSLP|work=Das Jahr, H.385 (Hensel, Fanny)|cname=''Das Jahr''}}|group=n}} The writer Kristine Forney has suggested that the poems, artwork and coloured paper may represent the different stages of life, with some suggesting they represent Mendelssohn's life.<ref>Forney (2014), p. 177</ref> In a letter from Rome, Fanny described the process behind composing ''Das Jahr'':<blockquote>I have been composing a good deal lately, and have called my piano pieces after the names of my favourite haunts, partly because they really came into my mind at these spots, partly because our pleasant excursions were in my mind while I was writing them. They will form a delightful souvenir, a kind of second diary. But do not imagine that I give these names when playing them in society, they are for home use entirely.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Style and form ===
[[File:Julius Eduard Wilhelm Helfft - The Music Room of Fanny Hensel (nee Mendelssohn) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Fanny Hensel's music room in the Hensel house, Leipziger Str. 3, Berlin]] Angela Mace, the musicologist who proved Fanny Hensel's authorship of the ''Easter Sonata'', considers that Fanny was much more experimental with her lieder than Felix, noting that her works have a \"harmonic density\" that serves to express emotion.<ref>Mace (2013) p. 10</ref> 

R. Larry Todd has pointed out that, although there has been much comment about the influence of Felix's music on Fanny (and some comment on that of Fanny on Felix), both were strongly influenced by the later music of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in terms of [[ musical form|form]], [[tonality]] and [[fugue|fugal]] [[counterpoint]].<ref>Todd (2010), p. 182</ref>. This is reflected for example in Fanny's string quartet.<ref>Song (2016), p. 1</ref>

Musicologist Stephen Rodgers has claimed that the relative lack of analysis of Fanny Mendelssohn's music has left the presence of triple [[hypermeter]] in her songs mostly overlooked. He points to this type of meter being used by Mendelssohn to alter the speed of vocals in the song and to reflect emotions through distortion of duple norms.<ref>Rogers (2011b), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> He also points to a lack of [[tonic (music)|tonic]] harmony as a recurring characteristic of her lieder, identifying it in the lied ''Verlust'' as a deliberate means to reflect the song's themes of abandonment and failing to find love. Mendelssohn's use of [[word painting]] is also acknowledged as a common element of her style, a method of stressing emotion in the song text.<ref>Rogers (2011a), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> She commonly used [[strophic form]] for her songs, and her piano accompaniments frequently doubled the voice-line, characteristics also of the music of her teachers Zelter and Berger.<ref>Draper (2012), p. 87</ref> Though the foundation created by her teachers would remain, Rodgers suggests that she increasingly turned to [[through-composed]] forms as her style developed, as a way to respond to elements of poetic text.<ref>Rogers (2011b) p. 201</ref>

==Legacy==
===Museum===
The Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum, which is dedicated to the lives and work of Fanny Mendelssohn and her brother Felix, opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.<ref>KomponistenQuartier (n.d.)</ref>

===Music===
In the six months before his death, Felix attempted to ensure that his sister received the recognition that had been withheld throughout most of her life by collecting many of her works with the intent of releasing them to the public through his publisher, [[Breitkopf & Härtel]]. In 1850, the publisher began to distribute Fanny Mendelssohn's unreleased works, starting with ''Vier Lieder'' Op. 8.<ref>Todd (2010), p. 351</ref>

In recent{{when|date=April 2020}} years, Fanny Mendelssohn's music has become better known thanks to concert performances and a number of CDs being released on labels such as [[Hyperion Records|Hyperion]] and [[Classic Produktion Osnabrück|CPO]].{{cn|date=April 2020}} Her ''Easter Sonata'' for piano, formerly attributed to Felix, was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>

===Writings===
Fanny Mendelssohn published no writings during her lifetime. Selected letters and journal entries were published during the nineteenth century, notably by Sebastian Hensel in his book on the Mendelssohn family. Her collected letters to Felix, edited by Marcia Citron, were published in 1987.<ref name=Grove /><ref>Hensel (1884)</ref><ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) 1987</ref>

===Biographical and musicological studies===
During the 19th century Fanny mainly figured as a bystander in biographes and studies of her brother Felix; typically she was a representative of a supposed 'feminizing' influence that sapped his artistry.<ref>Kimber (2004), pp. 48-49</ref> In the 20th century the conventional narrative switched to presenting Felix as disapproving of his sister's musical activities and seeking to contain them, whilst the 'feminizing' accusation against Fanny evaporated.<ref>Kimber (2004), pp. 49-50</ref> From the 1980s onwards Fanny Hensel Mendelssohn has been the subject of many academic books and articles.<ref>See bibliography in Mace Christian (2018)</ref><ref>{{Harvp|Stokes|2019}}</ref> Kimber opines that \"The tale of Fanny, the \"supressed\" composer, has so readily found as place in the biographies of the siblings because of its resemblance to prevailing models  for the life of a 'Great Composer' [...] based in Romantic ideology about male artists [...] Hensel fits neatly into a traditonal narrative of the suffering artistic genius[...] with a modern twist: the feminine gender of its main character. Thus two characters [Felix and Fanny] are forced to bear the weight of two centuries of gender ideology.\"<ref>Kimber (2004), p. 52</ref>

==Education and early life==
Conway was born in [[Liverpool]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/680/000082434/ |title=John Conway |publisher=www.nndb.com |accessdate=10 August 2010 }}</ref> on 26 December 1937, the son of Cyril Horton Conway and Agnes Boyce.<ref name=\"whoswho\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U11688 |title=CONWAY, Prof. John Horton |work=Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014; online edn, Oxford University Press }}{{subscription required}}</ref><ref name=\"mactutor\" /> He became interested in mathematics at a very early age. By the age of eleven his ambition was to become a mathematician.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Horton Conway|website=Dean of the Faculty, Princeton University|url=https://dof.princeton.edu/about/clerk-faculty/emeritus/john-horton-conway}}</ref><ref name=\"frontiers\">{{cite book|title=Mathematical Frontiers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmCSpNhXMooC&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38 | page=38 | publisher=Infobase Publishing | year = 2006 | isbn=978-0-7910-9719-9}}</ref>

After leaving [[sixth form]], Conway entered [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]<ref name=\"whoswho\"/> to study mathematics. Conway, who was a \"terribly introverted adolescent\" in school, interpreted his admission to Cambridge as an opportunity to transform himself into a new person: an \"extrovert\".<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Siobhan|authorlink=Siobhan Roberts|title=John Horton Conway: the world's most charismatic mathematician|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/23/john-horton-conway-the-most-charismatic-mathematician-in-the-world|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Ronan2006\">{{cite book|author=Mark Ronan|title=Symmetry and the Monster: One of the greatest quests of mathematics|url=https://archive.org/details/symmetrymonstero0000rona|url-access=registration|date=18 May 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-157938-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/symmetrymonstero0000rona/page/163 163]|author-link=Mark Ronan}}</ref>

He was awarded his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1959 and began to undertake research in number theory supervised by [[Harold Davenport]]. Having solved the open problem posed by Davenport on [[Waring's problem|writing numbers as the sums of fifth powers]], Conway began to become interested in infinite ordinals.<ref name=\"frontiers\" /> It appears that his interest in games began during his years studying the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]], where he became an avid [[backgammon]] player, spending hours playing the game in the common room. He was awarded his doctorate in 1964 and was appointed as College Fellow and Lecturer in Mathematics at [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]].<ref name=\"genealogy\">{{cite book|author=Sooyoung Chang|year=2011|title = Academic Genealogy of Mathematicians | publisher = World Scientific | page=205 | ISBN=978-981-4282-29-1}}</ref>

After leaving Cambridge in 1986, he took up the appointment to the [[John von Neumann]] Chair of Mathematics at Princeton University.<ref name=\"genealogy\" />

==Conway's Game of Life==
{{Main|Conway's Game of Life}}
[[File:Gospers glider gun.gif|thumb|right|A single [[Bill Gosper|Gosper]]'s [[Gun (cellular automaton)|Glider Gun]] creating \"[[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]]\" in [[Conway's Game of Life]]]]
Conway is especially known for the invention of the [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]], one of the early examples of a [[cellular automaton]]. His initial experiments in that field were done with pen and paper, long before personal computers existed.

Since the game was introduced by Martin Gardner in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1970,<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Mathematical Games: The fantastic combinations of John Conway's new solitaire game \"Life\"|first=Martin|last=Gardner|magazine=Scientific American|volume=223|date=October 1970|pages=120–123}}</ref> it has spawned hundreds of computer programs, web sites, and articles.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Artificial_Life/Cellular_Automata/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life |title=DMOZ: Conway's Game of Life: Sites |access-date=11 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317103511/http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Artificial_Life/Cellular_Automata/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life/ |archive-date=17 March 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is a staple of recreational mathematics. There is an extensive [[wiki]] devoted to curating and cataloging the various aspects of the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page|title=LifeWiki|website=www.conwaylife.com}}</ref> From the earliest days, it has been a favorite in computer labs, both for its theoretical interest and as a practical exercise in programming and data display. At times Conway had said he hates the Game of Life—largely because it has come to overshadow some of the other deeper and more important things he has done.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8kUJL04ELA Does John Conway hate his Game of Life?] (video)</ref> Nevertheless, the game did help launch a new branch of mathematics, the field of [[cellular automata]].<ref>MacTutor History: The game made Conway instantly famous, but it also opened up a whole new field of mathematical research, the field of cellular automata.</ref>

The Game of Life is known to be [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]].<ref>Rendell (2015)</ref><ref name=case>Case (2014)</ref>

==Conway and Martin Gardner==
Conway's career was intertwined with that of mathematics popularizer and ''[[Scientific American]]'' columnist [[Martin Gardner]]. When Gardner featured Conway's Game of Life in his [[Mathematical Games column]] in October 1970, it became the most widely read of all his columns and made Conway an instant celebrity.<ref>''[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29688355 Martin Gardner, puzzle master extraordinaire]'' by [[Colm Mulcahy]], [[BBC News Magazine]], 21 October 2014: \"The Game of Life appeared in Scientific American in 1970, and was by far the most successful of Gardner's columns, in terms of reader response.\"</ref><ref name=topten>Mulcahy (2014).</ref> Gardner and Conway had first corresponded in the late 1950s, and over the years Gardner had frequently written about recreational aspects of Conway's work.<ref>[http://mathfactor.uark.edu/2010/06/ha-conway-on-gardner/ The Math Factor Podcast Website] John H. Conway reminisces on his long friendship and collaboration with Martin Gardner.</ref> For instance, he discussed Conway's game of [[Sprouts (game)|Sprouts]] (Jul 1967), [[Hackenbush]] (Jan 1972), and his [[Angel problem|angel and devil problem]] (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column, he reviewed Conway's book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and even managed to explain Conway's [[surreal numbers]].<ref>Martin Gardner, ''Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers'', W. H. Freeman & Co., 1989, {{ISBN|0-7167-1987-8}}, Chapter 4. A non-technical overview; reprint of the 1976 Scientific American article.</ref> 

Conway was probably the most important member of [[Martin Gardner#Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine|Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine]]. He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit, Gardner kept him for a week, pumping him for information on the [[Penrose tiling]]s which had just been announced. Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.<ref>''[http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/fea-gardner.pdf Interview with Martin Gardner]'' [[Notices of the AMS]], Vol. 52, No. 6, June/July 2005, pp. 602–611</ref> Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.<ref>[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/ A Life In Games: The Playful Genius of John Conway] by [[Siobhan Roberts]], [[Quanta Magazine]], 28 August 2015</ref> The cover of that issue of ''Scientific American'' features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.<ref name=topten/>

Conferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.<ref>[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner</ref><ref name= bellos>Bellos, Alex (2008).

==Major areas of research==

===Combinatorial game theory===
Conway was widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.

He was also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.

He invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.

===Geometry===
In the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]].<ref>J. H. Conway, \"Four-dimensional Archimedean polytopes\", Proc. Colloquium on Convexity, Copenhagen 1965, Kobenhavns Univ. Mat. Institut (1967) 38–39.</ref> Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].

In the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329–353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>

He investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].

===Geometric topology===
In knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>

===Group theory===
He was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].

Based on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics—[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>

Conway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.

===Number theory===
As a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>

===Algebra===
Conway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>

===Analysis===
He invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].

===Algorithmics===
For calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practiced his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.

===Theoretical physics===
In 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>

==Awards and honours==
Conway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[Pólya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]] for Mathematical Exposition (2000) of the [[American Mathematical Society]].
His nomination, in 1981, reads: {{quote|A versatile mathematician who combines a deep combinatorial insight with algebraic virtuosity, particularly in the construction and manipulation of \"off-beat\" algebraic structures which illuminate a wide variety of problems in completely unexpected ways. He has made distinguished contributions to the theory of finite groups, to the theory of knots, to mathematical logic (both set theory and automata theory) and to the theory of games (as also to its practice).<ref name=royal/>}}

In 2017 Conway was given honorary membership of the British [[Mathematical Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.m-a.org.uk/honorary-members|title=Honorary Members|last=|first=|date=|website=The Mathematical Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>

==Death==
On 8 April 2020, Conway, who had been struggling with health problems for years, developed a fever from [[COVID-19]].

==Education and early life==
Conway was born in [[Liverpool]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/680/000082434/ |title=John Conway |publisher=www.nndb.com |accessdate=10 August 2010 }}</ref> on 26 December 1937, the son of Cyril Horton Conway and Agnes Boyce.<ref name=\"whoswho\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U11688 |title=CONWAY, Prof. John Horton |work=Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014; online edn, Oxford University Press }}{{subscription required}}</ref><ref name=\"mactutor\" /> He became interested in mathematics at a very early age. By the age of eleven his ambition was to become a mathematician.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Horton Conway|website=Dean of the Faculty, Princeton University|url=https://dof.princeton.edu/about/clerk-faculty/emeritus/john-horton-conway}}</ref><ref name=\"frontiers\">{{cite book|title=Mathematical Frontiers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmCSpNhXMooC&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38 | page=38 | publisher=Infobase Publishing | year = 2006 | isbn=978-0-7910-9719-9}}</ref>

After leaving [[sixth form]], Conway entered [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]<ref name=\"whoswho\"/> to study mathematics. Conway, who was a \"terribly introverted adolescent\" in school, interpreted his admission to Cambridge as an opportunity to transform himself into a new person: an \"extrovert\".<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Siobhan|authorlink=Siobhan Roberts|title=John Horton Conway: the world's most charismatic mathematician|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/23/john-horton-conway-the-most-charismatic-mathematician-in-the-world|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Ronan2006\">{{cite book|author=Mark Ronan|title=Symmetry and the Monster: One of the greatest quests of mathematics|url=https://archive.org/details/symmetrymonstero0000rona|url-access=registration|date=18 May 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-157938-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/symmetrymonstero0000rona/page/163 163]|author-link=Mark Ronan}}</ref>

He was awarded his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1959 and began to undertake research in number theory supervised by [[Harold Davenport]]. Having solved the open problem posed by Davenport on [[Waring's problem|writing numbers as the sums of fifth powers]], Conway began to become interested in infinite ordinals.<ref name=\"frontiers\" /> It appears that his interest in games began during his years studying the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]], where he became an avid [[backgammon]] player, spending hours playing the game in the common room. He was awarded his doctorate in 1964 and was appointed as College Fellow and Lecturer in Mathematics at [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]].<ref name=\"genealogy\">{{cite book|author=Sooyoung Chang|year=2011|title = Academic Genealogy of Mathematicians | publisher = World Scientific | page=205 | ISBN=978-981-4282-29-1}}</ref>

==Conway's Game of Life==

[[File:Gospers glider gun.gif|thumb|right|A single [[Bill Gosper|Gosper]]'s [[Gun (cellular automaton)|Glider Gun]] creating \"[[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]]\" in [[Conway's Game of Life]]]]
Conway is especially known for the invention of the [[Game of Life]], one of the early examples of a [[cellular automaton]]. His initial experiments in that field were done with pen and paper, long before personal computers existed.

Since the game was introduced by Martin Gardner in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1970,<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Mathematical Games: The fantastic combinations of John Conway's new solitaire game \"Life\"|first=Martin|last=Gardner|magazine=Scientific American|volume=223|date=October 1970|pages=120–123}}</ref> it has spawned hundreds of computer programs, web sites, and articles.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Artificial_Life/Cellular_Automata/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life |title=DMOZ: Conway's Game of Life: Sites |access-date=11 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317103511/http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Artificial_Life/Cellular_Automata/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life/ |archive-date=17 March 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is a staple of recreational mathematics. There is an extensive [[wiki]] devoted to curating and cataloging the various aspects of the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page|title=LifeWiki|website=www.conwaylife.com}}</ref> From the earliest days, it has been a favorite in computer labs, both for its theoretical interest and as a practical exercise in programming and data display. At times Conway had said he hates the Game of Life—largely because it has come to overshadow some of the other deeper and more important things he has done.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8kUJL04ELA Does John Conway hate his Game of Life?] (video)</ref> Nevertheless, the game did help launch a new branch of mathematics, the field of [[cellular automata]].<ref>MacTutor History: The game made Conway instantly famous, but it also opened up a whole new field of mathematical research, the field of cellular automata.</ref>

The Game of Life is known to be [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]].<ref>Rendell (2015)</ref><ref name=case>Case (2014)</ref>

==Conway and Martin Gardner==
Conway's career was intertwined with that of mathematics popularizer and ''[[Scientific American]]'' columnist [[Martin Gardner]]. When Gardner featured Conway's Game of Life in his [[Mathematical Games column]] in October 1970, it became the most widely read of all his columns and made Conway an instant celebrity.<ref>''[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29688355 Martin Gardner, puzzle master extraordinaire]'' by [[Colm Mulcahy]], [[BBC News Magazine]], 21 October 2014: \"The Game of Life appeared in Scientific American in 1970, and was by far the most successful of Gardner's columns, in terms of reader response.\"</ref><ref name=topten>Mulcahy (2014).</ref> Gardner and Conway had first corresponded in the late 1950s, and over the years Gardner had frequently written about recreational aspects of Conway's work.<ref>[http://mathfactor.uark.edu/2010/06/ha-conway-on-gardner/ The Math Factor Podcast Website] John H. Conway reminisces on his long friendship and collaboration with Martin Gardner.</ref> For instance, he discussed Conway's game of [[Sprouts (game)|Sprouts]] (Jul 1967), [[Hackenbush]] (Jan 1972), and his [[Angel problem|angel and devil problem]] (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column, he reviewed Conway's book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and even managed to explain Conway's [[surreal numbers]].<ref>Martin Gardner, ''Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers'', W. H. Freeman & Co., 1989, {{ISBN|0-7167-1987-8}}, Chapter 4. A non-technical overview; reprint of the 1976 Scientific American article.</ref> 

Conway was probably the most important member of [[Martin Gardner#Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine|Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine]]. He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit, Gardner kept him for a week, pumping him for information on the [[Penrose tiling]]s which had just been announced. Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.<ref>''[http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/fea-gardner.pdf Interview with Martin Gardner]'' [[Notices of the AMS]], Vol. 52, No. 6, June/July 2005, pp. 602–611</ref> Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.<ref>[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/ A Life In Games: The Playful Genius of John Conway] by [[Siobhan Roberts]], [[Quanta Magazine]], 28 August 2015</ref> The cover of that issue of ''Scientific American'' features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.<ref name=topten/>

Conferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.<ref>[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner</ref><ref name= bellos>Bellos, Alex (2008).

==Major areas of research==

===Combinatorial game theory===
Conway was widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.

He was also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.

He invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.

===Geometry===
In the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]].<ref>J. H. Conway, \"Four-dimensional Archimedean polytopes\", Proc. Colloquium on Convexity, Copenhagen 1965, Kobenhavns Univ. Mat. Institut (1967) 38–39.</ref> Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].

In the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329–353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>

He investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].

===Geometric topology===
In knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>

===Group theory===
He was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].

Based on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics—[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>

Conway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.

===Number theory===
As a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>

===Algebra===
Conway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>

===Analysis===
He invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].

===Algorithmics===
For calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practiced his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.

===Theoretical physics===
In 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>

==Awards and honours==
Conway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[Pólya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]] for Mathematical Exposition (2000) of the [[American Mathematical Society]].
His nomination, in 1981, reads: {{quote|A versatile mathematician who combines a deep combinatorial insight with algebraic virtuosity, particularly in the construction and manipulation of \"off-beat\" algebraic structures which illuminate a wide variety of problems in completely unexpected ways. He has made distinguished contributions to the theory of finite groups, to the theory of knots, to mathematical logic (both set theory and automata theory) and to the theory of games (as also to its practice).<ref name=royal/>}}

In 2017 Conway was given honorary membership of the British [[Mathematical Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.m-a.org.uk/honorary-members|title=Honorary Members|last=|first=|date=|website=The Mathematical Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>

==Death==
On 8 April 2020, Conway, who had been struggling with health problems for years, developed a fever from [[COVID-19]]. On 11 April 2020, Conway died at age 82.<ref name=\"dailyvoice\" /><ref name=\"NRC\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://math.unm.edu/news-events/news/famous-british-mathematician-john-horton-conway-passed-april-11|title=Famous British mathematician John Horton Conway passed on April 11 |last=|first=|date=|website=UNM|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

[[The Strokes]] are an American [[indie rock]] band. Formed in New York City in 1999, the group consists of singer [[Julian Casablancas]], guitarists [[Nick Valensi]] and [[Albert Hammond Jr.]], bassist [[Nikolai Fraiture]] and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]]. The Strokes [[discography]] consists of six [[studio album]]s, two [[extended play]]s (EP), twelve [[single (music)|single]]s, one video album and eighteen [[music video]]s.

In January 2001, the Strokes released a [[Demo (music)|demo]] EP, ''[[The Modern Age]]'', on [[independent record label]] [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]. The large amount of hype generated by the record, especially among the British music press, led to a bidding war among [[major record label]]s.<ref>Phares, Heather. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p478260/biography|pure_url=yes}} The Strokes Biography]. [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved on May 21, 2008.</ref> The band signed with [[RCA Records]], and released its debut LP ''[[Is This It]]'' in October 2001. Helped by lead single \"[[Hard to Explain]]\", the album debuted at number two in the [[UK Albums Chart|UK]] and number 33 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Highly acclaimed by critics, ''Is This It'' was certified platinum in the US and UK, selling over two million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"pitchfork\">Deusner, Stephen M. (January 3, 2006). [http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/22084-first-impressions-of-earth \"''First Impressions of Earth'' Record Review\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516094236/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/22084-first-impressions-of-earth |date=2008-05-16 }}. [[Pitchfork Media]]. Retrieved on May 21, 2008.</ref>

The Strokes released their next LP, ''[[Room on Fire]]'', in October 2003. The album did well on the charts, reaching number two and going platinum in the UK, while peaking at the fourth spot in the US. Three singles were released from the album, the highest-charting of which was \"[[12:51 (The Strokes song)|12:51]]\", which reached number seven in the UK. The band's third album ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'' was released in December 2005 in Germany and January 2006 elsewhere. Although critics suggested the post-Christmas release date was an indication of the band's lower expectations of the record, it was the first Strokes album to top the UK charts.<ref name=\"pitchfork\"/> \"[[Juicebox (song)|Juicebox]]\" became the first single by the group to break into the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was its highest-charting effort in Britain, where it reached number five.

Released after a long hiatus, The Strokes' fourth album ''[[Angles (The Strokes album)|Angles]]'' (2011) became their third consecutive LP to chart at number four on the ''Billboard'' 200. Its 2013 follow-up ''[[Comedown Machine]]'' reached number ten on both the U.S. and British charts. In 2016 the Strokes released their second EP, ''[[Future Present Past]]''.

[[The Strokes]] are an American [[indie rock]] band. Formed in New York City in 1999, the group consists of singer [[Julian Casablancas]], guitarists [[Nick Valensi]] and [[Albert Hammond Jr.]], bassist [[Nikolai Fraiture]] and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]]. The Strokes [[discography]] consists of six [[studio album]]s, two [[extended play]]s (EP), twelve [[single (music)|single]]s, one video album and eighteen [[music video]]s.

In January 2001, the Strokes released a [[Demo (music)|demo]] EP, ''[[The Modern Age]]'', on [[independent record label]] [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]. The large amount of hype generated by the record, especially among the British music press, led to a bidding war among [[major record label]]s.<ref>Phares, Heather. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p478260/biography|pure_url=yes}} The Strokes Biography]. [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved on May 21, 2008.</ref> The band signed with [[RCA Records]], and released its debut LP ''[[Is This It]]'' in October 2001. Helped by lead single \"[[Hard to Explain]]\", the album debuted at number two in the [[UK Albums Chart|UK]] and number 33 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Highly acclaimed by critics, ''Is This It'' was certified platinum in the US and UK, selling over two million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"pitchfork\">Deusner, Stephen M. (January 3, 2006). [http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/22084-first-impressions-of-earth \"''First Impressions of Earth'' Record Review\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516094236/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/22084-first-impressions-of-earth |date=2008-05-16 }}. [[Pitchfork Media]]. Retrieved on May 21, 2008.</ref>

The Strokes released their next LP, ''[[Room on Fire]]'', in October 2003. The album did well on the charts, reaching number two and going platinum in the UK, while peaking at the fourth spot in the US. Three singles were released from the album, the highest-charting of which was \"[[12:51 (The Strokes song)|12:51]]\", which reached number seven in the UK. The band's third album ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'' was released in December 2005 in Germany and January 2006 elsewhere. Although critics suggested the post-Christmas release date was an indication of the band's lower expectations of the record, it was the first Strokes album to top the UK charts.<ref name=\"pitchfork\"/> \"[[Juicebox (song)|Juicebox]]\" became the first single by the group to break into the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was its highest-charting effort in Britain, where it reached number five.

Released after a long hiatus, The Strokes' fourth album ''[[Angles (The Strokes album)|Angles]]'' (2011) became their third consecutive LP to chart at number four on the ''Billboard'' 200. Its 2013 follow-up ''[[Comedown Machine]]'' reached number ten on both the U.S. and British charts. In 2016 the Strokes released their second EP, ''[[Future Present Past]]''.

Eversource predecessor Northeast Utilities (NU) was formed on July 1, 1966, with the merger of [[Connecticut Light and Power Company]] (CL&P, formed in 1917), [[Western Massachusetts Electric Company]] (WMECO, formed in 1886), and the [[Hartford Electric Light Company]] (HELCO, formed in 1878) under a single parent company, creating the first new multi-state public utility holding company since the enactment of the [[Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935]]. In 1967, [[Holyoke Water Power Company]] (HWP) (formed in 1859) joined the NU System, and in 1992 the '''Public Service Company of New Hampshire''' ([[PSNH]], formed in 1926) followed.

After some up-and-down growth under CEO [[Lelan Sillin]] (1970–1983) and his successor, William B. Ellis, PSNH declared bankruptcy in January 1988 due to problems getting a license for the completed [[Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/29/business/bankruptcy-filed-by-leading-utility-in-seabrook-plant.html |author=Lee A. Daniels |date=29 Jan 1988 |title=BANKRUPTCY FILED BY LEADING UTILITY IN SEABROOK PLANT}}</ref>

In 1999 Con Edison and Northeast Utilities entered negotiations that would have created one of the largest utilities in the United States. However, Con Edison backed out of the merger in 2001 after Connecticut's [[Attorney General]] [[Richard Blumenthal]] threatened lawsuits to block it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/06/nyregion/northeast-says-merger-with-con-edison-has-collapsed.html|title=Northeast Says Merger With Con Edison Has Collapsed|date=6 March 2001|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

Legislation passed in the late 1990s deregulated the electricity market in New England and required regulated utilities to divest generating stations to competitive suppliers. In 1999 the company divested all of the generating assets of WMECO and CL&P per requirements of the Massachusetts and Connecticut legislation. The company retained some of these assets by transferring them to a new subsidiary called Northeast Generation which functioned as a competitive supplier and sold the other assets entirely: WMECO's [[West Springfield Generating Station]] and several related hydroelectric and fossil fuel generating units were sold to Con Edison, while other assets (most notably the [[Northfield Mountain hydroelectric facility]]) were transferred to Northeast Generation.

In 2001, NU sold the assets and operations of its subsidiary, the Holyoke Water Power Company, to the [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|City of Holyoke]] including the HWP electrical distribution system and customer base and all generation with the exception of the [[Mount Tom Station|Mt. Tom coal-fired power plant]] which NU retained. The city's municipal gas and electric department assumed responsibility for the generators and absorbed the HWP distribution customer base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hged.com/html/our_history.html|title=History|work=hged.com|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref> Between 2000 and 2002 due to state laws, NU divested WMECO, CL&P, and PSNH's nuclear generating assets which consisted of their stakes in the [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant|Seabrook]], [[Millstone Nuclear Power Plant|Millstone]], and [[Vermont Yankee]] stations.

In November 2005, the company announced it would sell its unregulated competitive businesses, including generation and energy services.  In November 2006 the company had essentially completed the divestiture of its competitive businesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/northeast-utilities-completes-sale-of-competitive-generation-business-to-energy-capital-partners-55838902.html|title=Northeast Utilities Completes Sale of Competitive Generation Business to Energy Capital Partners|author=Northeast Utilities|date=1 November 2006|work=prnewswire.com|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref>

In 2006, NU decided to sell the generating units it had earlier retained in the 1999 divestiture as competitive suppliers and shut down its competitive generation business units. The Northeast Generation assets, including [[Mount Tom Station]] and Northfield Mountain, were all sold to Energy Capital Partners. PSNH continued to operate regulated hydroelectric and fossil fuel generation assets to serve its default/basic service customers who did not choose an alternative competitive supplier.

In October 2010, Northeast Utilities announced that it would merge with [[NSTAR (company)|NSTAR]], the major electric and gas provider in [[Greater Boston]], with the resulting company retaining the Northeast Utilities name for the next several years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2010/10/northeast_utili_2.html|title=NStar and Northeast Utilities agree to merger|last=Ailworth|first=Erin|date=2010-10-18|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=2010-10-18}}</ref>  After government approvals, the deal closed in April 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nu-closes-nstar-merger-deal-223023927.html|title=NU Closes NSTAR Merger Deal|date=2012-04-11|accessdate=2013-05-16}}</ref>

In 2015 the company (now known as Eversource) agreed to sell all of its New Hampshire generation assets in the same manner it sold its assets in Massachusetts and Connecticut between 2000 and 2006. The sale of the New Hampshire generation fleet was approved by the state's Public Utilities Commission on November 29, 2017,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.puc.state.nh.us/Home/Press%20Releases/112917%20eversource%20generation%20assets%20sale.pdf|title=NH Public Utilities Commission Issues Order Approving sale of Eversource Generation Facilities|last=Noonan|first=Amanda|date=November 29, 2017|website=State of NH Public Utilities Commission|access-date=February 16, 2018}}</ref> and completed on January 10, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unionleader.com/energy/Eversource-finalizes-sale-of-energy-plants-01102018|title=Eversource finalizes sale of energy plants|last=Feely|first=Paul|date=10 January 2018|work=The Union Leader (www.unionleader.com)|accessdate=16 February 2018}}</ref>

In June 2017 Eversource announced its merger with Aquarion Water Company for $1.675 billion. <ref>https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/06/02/eversource-enters-water-business-with-aquarion-acquisition/e2dLtfSYKOfe4et7jcvcFI/story.html</ref>  Aquarion would become a fully owned subsidiary and retain its own name, adding 300 employees and 230,000 customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. In December 2017, the merger was completed after government approval. <ref>https://globalenergymedia.com/eversource-completes-acquisition-of-aquarion-water-company-2</ref>

==  Major projects ==
Eversource Energy has participated in a number of projects to improve the reliability of the [[power grid]] in southwest Connecticut.  The first project was construction of the $350 million 345 kilovolt [[Bethel-Norwalk transmission line]] through the western part of the state, and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as Northeast Utilities.

With [[United Illuminating]], an upgrade to the 69-mile (112&nbsp;km), 345 kilovolt [[Middletown-Norwalk transmission line]] was energized in 2009 at a cost of $900 million.

In 2013, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, a component of the ongoing New England East-West Solution, was energized at a cost of $795 million. The project addressed numerous reliability issues with the Springfield, MA area's 115 kV transmission system by constructing two new 345 kV lines to the Agawam substation; one line north to Ludlow and the other south to North Bloomfield, Connecticut.

The new 345 kV corridor added a new strong interface between Massachusetts and Connecticut. The project also involved rebuilding all of the 115 kV lines along the transmission corridor between South Agawam and Ludlow to increase their capacities, building a new 115 kV transmission substation in East Springfield (Cadwell), replacing the Fairmont 115 kV transmission substation in Chicopee with a new substation across the street, and configuring a new 115 kV line from South Agawam to Southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former 115 kV path between Agawam and North Bloomfield. The new Cadwell and Fairmont switching stations allowed a number of three-terminal 115 kV lines to be broken up into two-terminal lines. Finally, the project allowed a problematic underground 115 kV transmission path through the city of Springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle. The underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the Breckwood substation in Springfield. A previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary. On November 20, 2013, cutover of 115 kV lines to the new Fairmont Switching Station was complete, marking substantial completion of the GSRP.

In May 2016, Eversource began an electrical infrastructure project in QueensBrook. The project involves replacing underground wire and transformers throughout the QB.

Eversource has taken action to support the use of [[electric vehicle]]s. Starting in 2018, the company began spending $45 million over five years to install over 400 electric vehicle charging stations in Massachusetts. The project is part of the company's Grid Modernization plan. The company has switched much of its power source from coal to [[natural gas]], wind, [[hydroelectricity]] and solar power.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.masslive.com/business-news/index.ssf/2018/08/eversource_rolls_out_electric_car_charge.html|title=Eversource begins rollout of 400 electric car chargers across Massachusetts; 'range anxiety' seen as enemy to emissions progress|work=masslive.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}</ref>

==HVDC transmission (\"Northern Pass\" Project)==
As Northeast Utilities the company signed on a joint venture with [[Hydro-Québec]] and [[NSTAR (company)|NSTAR]] to build a new [[High-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) line from [[Windsor, Quebec]] (connecting with the [[Hydro-Québec's electricity transmission system|Quebec grid]]) to a location in [[Franklin, New Hampshire]].  It is projected that the line will either run in an existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains.  This 180- to 190-mile line, projected to carry 1,200 megawatts, will carry electricity to approximately one million homes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rutlandherald.com/article/20081219/NEWS03/812190315/1004/NEWS03 |title=Utilities plan for N.E. expansion |work=Rutland Herald |first=Louis |last=Porter |date=19 December 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615232130/http://www.rutlandherald.com/article/20081219/NEWS03/812190315/1004/NEWS03 |archive-date=15 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The issue of buying hydropower from Hydro-Québec had been an issue during the [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2010|Massachusetts gubernatorial election of 2010]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Beth |last=Daley |title=Canadian firm offers N.E. more hydropower |work=The Boston Globe |date=2010-10-23 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/10/23/canadian_firm_offers_ne_more_hydropower/?page=full |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> In November 2015, the [[Sierra Club]] of New Hampshire also expressed opposition for the new line, saying that it would not only benefit Connecticut and Massachusetts residents more than those in New Hampshire, but also the concern of the flooding of [[Boreal forest of Canada|Boreal forests]] during the construction of Hydro-Québec's dams in northern Quebec, disputes with the [[Innu]] First Nations, and the effects of tourism and the environment within the [[White Mountain National Forest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/quebec-is-facing-its-own-dirty-energy-problem/article27502571/?click=sf_globefb|title=Quebec is facing its own ‘dirty’ energy export problem|publisher=}}</ref>

== Rate hikes and solar charges ==
In Massachusetts, Attorney General [[Maura Healey]] testified in March, 2017 before the DPU urging it to deny Eversource's proposed $300 million rate increase. In her testimony,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mass.gov/ago/news-and-updates/press-releases/2017/ag-healey-testifies-deny-eversource-rate-increase.html|title=AG Healey Testifies Against Eversource Rate Increase|date=2017-03-24|work=Attorney General of Massachusetts|access-date=2017-06-24|language=en}}</ref> she challenged the need for Eversource's rate increase, noting NSTAR's and WMECo's high returns over the last few years. Referencing NSTAR's 2015 return of more than 13 percent, Attorney General Healey told the DPU that “[l]ast year, no state public utility commission in the country allowed a return that high.” Between 2010 and 2015, Eversource's shareholders of common stock received a cumulative total return (including quarterly dividends and the change in the market price per share) of 89 percent.

On November 30, 2017, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities on Thursday approved a much-reduced rate hike<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/11/30/mass-officials-approve-eversource-rate-hike/gujPfvGU0uGKX6yKiHNa7N/story.html|title=Mass. officials approve Eversource rate hike - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2018-02-11}}</ref> for Eversource Energy that will allow it to charge its Massachusetts electric customers tens of millions of dollars more a year. On December 20, 2017, Attorney General Maura Healey appealed the DPU ruling in the Eversource rate case, specifically the DPU's approval of a costly 10 percent shareholder return, one of the highest rates allowed by an electric distribution company regulator in the last five years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mass.gov/news/ag-healey-appeals-eversource-rate-case-decision|title=AG Healey Appeals Eversource Rate Case Decision|work=Mass.gov|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en}}</ref>

On January 30, 2018, Massachusetts Rep. Thomas Golden and Sen. Michael Barrett held an Oversight Hearing on the DPU's decision to approve Eversource's proposal to include a demand charge as part of a monthly minimum reliability contribution on net metering customers. Rep. Golden accused the utility of purposefully making the new charges \"as confusing as possible.\" He said, \"Let me tell you something gentlemen, I'm not happy how this was rolled out. I'm not happy with the lack of information my office has received.\" Golden, co-chairman of the Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, helped write the 2016 law that permits utilities to levy a new minimum monthly charge, and he told Eversource executives they were making it \"extremely, extremely difficult\" for him to continue to support them in the policy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lowellsun.com/breakingnews/ci_31633713/frustration-grows-over-eversource-solar-charge|title=Golden, Barrett upset over Eversource solar charge|access-date=2018-02-11}}</ref>

== Price manipulation controversy ==
In 2017, an environmental group accused Eversource and Avangrid of driving up electric, gas rates over several winters<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/talking-points/2017/10/13/the-week-business/Eooyag6H74Q83W4JewxSvI/story.html|title=The week in business - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref> by buying up shipment capacity on a major pipeline that they ultimately did not use. The Environmental Defense Fund said both utilities routinely reserved big deliveries of natural gas on the Algonquin pipeline system for frigid days, but then sharply reduced those orders too late in the day for others to use that capacity. Those orders had the effect of driving up wholesale prices for natural gas during peak winter heating periods and in turn increasing the costs of electricity generated by gas-fired power plants. The two utilities “engaged in behavior that would tend to have the largest impact on prices,” said N. Jonathan Peress, a senior director at the New York-based environmental group. “That implies they knew their efforts would have some sort of pricing impact that would provide them with some commercial benefit.” Representatives for both utilities denied they did anything improper.

Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey is reviewing the findings,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-local-utilities-gamed-the-natural-gas-market-1510869318|title=How Local Utilities Gamed the Natural-Gas Market|last=Krupp|first=Fred|date=2017-11-17|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}</ref>{{update inline|date=November 2019}} U.S. Senator [[Richard Blumenthal]] asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to open an investigation on the matter, and both the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority and the Massachusetts Public Utilities Department are launching inquiries of their own.

==  Corporate structure ==
Before its rebranding the company operated six main subsidiaries: CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas.<ref name=\"nu.com\" />  All now currently operate under the Eversource name.

Eversource remains Connecticut's largest electric utility, serving more than 1.2 million residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers in approximately 149 cities and towns. It also serves approximately 229,000 natural gas customers in 73 cities and towns.

Eversource is also New Hampshire's largest electric utility, serving more than 500,000 homes and businesses in 211 cities and towns throughout the state.

It is also a main distributor of energy to 1.7 million customers throughout Massachusetts, including more than 1.4 million electric customers in 140 communities and more than 300,000 natural gas customers in 51 communities.

Eversource predecessor Northeast Utilities (NU) was formed on July 1, 1966, with the merger of [[Connecticut Light and Power Company]] (CL&P, formed in 1917), [[Western Massachusetts Electric Company]] (WMECO, formed in 1886), and the [[Hartford Electric Light Company]] (HELCO, formed in 1878) under a single parent company, creating the first new multi-state public utility holding company since the enactment of the [[Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935]]. In 1967, [[Holyoke Water Power Company]] (HWP) (formed in 1859) joined the NU System, and in 1992 the '''Public Service Company of New Hampshire''' ([[PSNH]], formed in 1926) followed.

After some up-and-down growth under CEO [[Lelan Sillin]] (1970–1983) and his successor, William B. Ellis, PSNH declared bankruptcy in January 1988 due to problems getting a license for the completed [[Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/29/business/bankruptcy-filed-by-leading-utility-in-seabrook-plant.html |author=Lee A. Daniels |date=29 Jan 1988 |title=BANKRUPTCY FILED BY LEADING UTILITY IN SEABROOK PLANT}}</ref>

In 1999 Con Edison and Northeast Utilities entered negotiations that would have created one of the largest utilities in the United States. However, Con Edison backed out of the merger in 2001 after Connecticut's [[Attorney General]] [[Richard Blumenthal]] threatened lawsuits to block it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/06/nyregion/northeast-says-merger-with-con-edison-has-collapsed.html|title=Northeast Says Merger With Con Edison Has Collapsed|date=6 March 2001|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

Legislation passed in the late 1990s deregulated the electricity market in New England and required regulated utilities to divest generating stations to competitive suppliers. In 1999 the company divested all of the generating assets of WMECO and CL&P per requirements of the Massachusetts and Connecticut legislation. The company retained some of these assets by transferring them to a new subsidiary called Northeast Generation which functioned as a competitive supplier and sold the other assets entirely: WMECO's [[West Springfield Generating Station]] and several related hydroelectric and fossil fuel generating units were sold to Con Edison, while other assets (most notably the [[Northfield Mountain hydroelectric facility]]) were transferred to Northeast Generation.

In 2001, NU sold the assets and operations of its subsidiary, the Holyoke Water Power Company, to the [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|City of Holyoke]] including the HWP electrical distribution system and customer base and all generation with the exception of the [[Mount Tom Station|Mt. Tom coal-fired power plant]] which NU retained. The city's municipal gas and electric department assumed responsibility for the generators and absorbed the HWP distribution customer base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hged.com/html/our_history.html|title=History|work=hged.com|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref> Between 2000 and 2002 due to state laws, NU divested WMECO, CL&P, and PSNH's nuclear generating assets which consisted of their stakes in the [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant|Seabrook]], [[Millstone Nuclear Power Plant|Millstone]], and [[Vermont Yankee]] stations.

In November 2005, the company announced it would sell its unregulated competitive businesses, including generation and energy services.  In November 2006 the company had essentially completed the divestiture of its competitive businesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/northeast-utilities-completes-sale-of-competitive-generation-business-to-energy-capital-partners-55838902.html|title=Northeast Utilities Completes Sale of Competitive Generation Business to Energy Capital Partners|author=Northeast Utilities|date=1 November 2006|work=prnewswire.com|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref>

In 2006, NU decided to sell the generating units it had earlier retained in the 1999 divestiture as competitive suppliers and shut down its competitive generation business units. The Northeast Generation assets, including [[Mount Tom Station]] and Northfield Mountain, were all sold to Energy Capital Partners. PSNH continued to operate regulated hydroelectric and fossil fuel generation assets to serve its default/basic service customers who did not choose an alternative competitive supplier.

In October 2010, Northeast Utilities announced that it would merge with [[NSTAR (company)|NSTAR]], the major electric and gas provider in [[Greater Boston]], with the resulting company retaining the Northeast Utilities name for the next several years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2010/10/northeast_utili_2.html|title=NStar and Northeast Utilities agree to merger|last=Ailworth|first=Erin|date=2010-10-18|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=2010-10-18}}</ref>  After government approvals, the deal closed in April 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nu-closes-nstar-merger-deal-223023927.html|title=NU Closes NSTAR Merger Deal|date=2012-04-11|accessdate=2013-05-16}}</ref>

In 2015 the company (now known as Eversource) agreed to sell all of its New Hampshire generation assets in the same manner it sold its assets in Massachusetts and Connecticut between 2000 and 2006. The sale of the New Hampshire generation fleet was approved by the state's Public Utilities Commission on November 29, 2017,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.puc.state.nh.us/Home/Press%20Releases/112917%20eversource%20generation%20assets%20sale.pdf|title=NH Public Utilities Commission Issues Order Approving sale of Eversource Generation Facilities|last=Noonan|first=Amanda|date=November 29, 2017|website=State of NH Public Utilities Commission|access-date=February 16, 2018}}</ref> and completed on January 10, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unionleader.com/energy/Eversource-finalizes-sale-of-energy-plants-01102018|title=Eversource finalizes sale of energy plants|last=Feely|first=Paul|date=10 January 2018|work=The Union Leader (www.unionleader.com)|accessdate=16 February 2018}}</ref>

In June 2017 Eversource announced its merger with Aquarion Water Company for $1.675 billion. <ref>https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/06/02/eversource-enters-water-business-with-aquarion-acquisition/e2dLtfSYKOfe4et7jcvcFI/story.html</ref>  Aquarion would become a fully owned subsidiary and retain its own name, adding 300 employees and 230,000 customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. In December 2017, the merger was completed after government approval. <ref>https://globalenergymedia.com/eversource-completes-acquisition-of-aquarion-water-company-2</ref>

==  Major projects ==
Eversource Energy has participated in a number of projects to improve the reliability of the [[power grid]] in southwest Connecticut.  The first project was construction of the $350 million 345 kilovolt [[Bethel-Norwalk transmission line]] through the western part of the state, and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as Northeast Utilities.

With [[United Illuminating]], an upgrade to the 69-mile (112&nbsp;km), 345 kilovolt [[Middletown-Norwalk transmission line]] was energized in 2009 at a cost of $900 million.

In 2013, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, a component of the ongoing New England East-West Solution, was energized at a cost of $795 million. The project addressed numerous reliability issues with the Springfield, MA area's 115 kV transmission system by constructing two new 345 kV lines to the Agawam substation; one line north to Ludlow and the other south to North Bloomfield, Connecticut.

The new 345 kV corridor added a new strong interface between Massachusetts and Connecticut. The project also involved rebuilding all of the 115 kV lines along the transmission corridor between South Agawam and Ludlow to increase their capacities, building a new 115 kV transmission substation in East Springfield (Cadwell), replacing the Fairmont 115 kV transmission substation in Chicopee with a new substation across the street, and configuring a new 115 kV line from South Agawam to Southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former 115 kV path between Agawam and North Bloomfield. The new Cadwell and Fairmont switching stations allowed a number of three-terminal 115 kV lines to be broken up into two-terminal lines. Finally, the project allowed a problematic underground 115 kV transmission path through the city of Springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle. The underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the Breckwood substation in Springfield. A previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary. On November 20, 2013, cutover of 115 kV lines to the new Fairmont Switching Station was complete, marking substantial completion of the GSRP.

In May 2016, Eversource began an electrical infrastructure project in QueensBrook. The project involves replacing underground wire and transformers throughout the QB.

Eversource has taken action to support the use of [[electric vehicle]]s. Starting in 2018, the company began spending $45 million over five years to install over 400 electric vehicle charging stations in Massachusetts. The project is part of the company's Grid Modernization plan. The company has switched much of its power source from coal to [[natural gas]], wind, [[hydroelectricity]] and solar power.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.masslive.com/business-news/index.ssf/2018/08/eversource_rolls_out_electric_car_charge.html|title=Eversource begins rollout of 400 electric car chargers across Massachusetts; 'range anxiety' seen as enemy to emissions progress|work=masslive.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}</ref>

==HVDC transmission (\"Northern Pass\" Project)==
As Northeast Utilities the company signed on a joint venture with [[Hydro-Québec]] and [[NSTAR (company)|NSTAR]] to build a new [[High-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) line from [[Windsor, Quebec]] (connecting with the [[Hydro-Québec's electricity transmission system|Quebec grid]]) to a location in [[Franklin, New Hampshire]].  It is projected that the line will either run in an existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains.  This 180- to 190-mile line, projected to carry 1,200 megawatts, will carry electricity to approximately one million homes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rutlandherald.com/article/20081219/NEWS03/812190315/1004/NEWS03 |title=Utilities plan for N.E. expansion |work=Rutland Herald |first=Louis |last=Porter |date=19 December 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615232130/http://www.rutlandherald.com/article/20081219/NEWS03/812190315/1004/NEWS03 |archive-date=15 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The issue of buying hydropower from Hydro-Québec had been an issue during the [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2010|Massachusetts gubernatorial election of 2010]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Beth |last=Daley |title=Canadian firm offers N.E. more hydropower |work=The Boston Globe |date=2010-10-23 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/10/23/canadian_firm_offers_ne_more_hydropower/?page=full |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> In November 2015, the [[Sierra Club]] of New Hampshire also expressed opposition for the new line, saying that it would not only benefit Connecticut and Massachusetts residents more than those in New Hampshire, but also the concern of the flooding of [[Boreal forest of Canada|Boreal forests]] during the construction of Hydro-Québec's dams in northern Quebec, disputes with the [[Innu]] First Nations, and the effects of tourism and the environment within the [[White Mountain National Forest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/quebec-is-facing-its-own-dirty-energy-problem/article27502571/?click=sf_globefb|title=Quebec is facing its own ‘dirty’ energy export problem|publisher=}}</ref>

==  Political connections ==
In 2015, Eversource fought the rooftop solar industry and supported anti-solar policies. In Massachusetts, they staffed the State House with lobbyists in order to end legislation promoting growth of the solar industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/boston/index.ssf/2015/11/action_on_solar_bill_at_center.html|title=Action on solar bill at center of fight between Eversource, National Grid and environmental groups|work=masslive.com|accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref> During the 2015 legislative session in New Hampshire, Eversource opposed an increase to the state's solar net metering cap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150324/NEWS05/150329553/-1/|title=Solar bill before NH House panel has both sides shifting stances|work=unionleader.com|accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref> New Hampshire's cap is lower than all neighboring states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtrf.com/story/30509508/tusk-calls-on-new-hampshire-to-protect-competition-and-solar-choice|title=TUSK Calls on New Hampshire to Protect Competition and Solar Choice|work=WTRF.com|accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref>

== Rate hikes and solar charges ==
In Massachusetts, Attorney General [[Maura Healey]] testified in March, 2017 before the DPU urging it to deny Eversource's proposed $300 million rate increase. In her testimony,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mass.gov/ago/news-and-updates/press-releases/2017/ag-healey-testifies-deny-eversource-rate-increase.html|title=AG Healey Testifies Against Eversource Rate Increase|date=2017-03-24|work=Attorney General of Massachusetts|access-date=2017-06-24|language=en}}</ref> she challenged the need for Eversource's rate increase, noting NSTAR's and WMECo's high returns over the last few years. Referencing NSTAR's 2015 return of more than 13 percent, Attorney General Healey told the DPU that “[l]ast year, no state public utility commission in the country allowed a return that high.” Between 2010 and 2015, Eversource's shareholders of common stock received a cumulative total return (including quarterly dividends and the change in the market price per share) of 89 percent.

On November 30, 2017, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities on Thursday approved a much-reduced rate hike<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/11/30/mass-officials-approve-eversource-rate-hike/gujPfvGU0uGKX6yKiHNa7N/story.html|title=Mass. officials approve Eversource rate hike - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2018-02-11}}</ref> for Eversource Energy that will allow it to charge its Massachusetts electric customers tens of millions of dollars more a year. On December 20, 2017, Attorney General Maura Healey appealed the DPU ruling in the Eversource rate case, specifically the DPU's approval of a costly 10 percent shareholder return, one of the highest rates allowed by an electric distribution company regulator in the last five years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mass.gov/news/ag-healey-appeals-eversource-rate-case-decision|title=AG Healey Appeals Eversource Rate Case Decision|work=Mass.gov|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en}}</ref>

On January 30, 2018, Massachusetts Rep. Thomas Golden and Sen. Michael Barrett held an Oversight Hearing on the DPU's decision to approve Eversource's proposal to include a demand charge as part of a monthly minimum reliability contribution on net metering customers. Rep. Golden accused the utility of purposefully making the new charges \"as confusing as possible.\" He said, \"Let me tell you something gentlemen, I'm not happy how this was rolled out. I'm not happy with the lack of information my office has received.\" Golden, co-chairman of the Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, helped write the 2016 law that permits utilities to levy a new minimum monthly charge, and he told Eversource executives they were making it \"extremely, extremely difficult\" for him to continue to support them in the policy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lowellsun.com/breakingnews/ci_31633713/frustration-grows-over-eversource-solar-charge|title=Golden, Barrett upset over Eversource solar charge|access-date=2018-02-11}}</ref>

The Environmental Defense Fund said both utilities routinely reserved big deliveries of natural gas on the Algonquin pipeline system for frigid days, but then sharply reduced those orders too late in the day for others to use that capacity. Those orders had the effect of driving up wholesale prices for natural gas during peak winter heating periods and in turn increasing the costs of electricity generated by gas-fired power plants. The two utilities “engaged in behavior that would tend to have the largest impact on prices,” said N. Jonathan Peress, a senior director at the New York-based environmental group. “That implies they knew their efforts would have some sort of pricing impact that would provide them with some commercial benefit.” Representatives for both utilities denied they did anything improper.

Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey is reviewing the findings,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-local-utilities-gamed-the-natural-gas-market-1510869318|title=How Local Utilities Gamed the Natural-Gas Market|last=Krupp|first=Fred|date=2017-11-17|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}</ref>{{update inline|date=November 2019}} U.S. Senator [[Richard Blumenthal]] asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to open an investigation on the matter, and both the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority and the Massachusetts Public Utilities Department are launching inquiries of their own.

On Feb. 27, 2018, FERC announced their investigation “revealed no evidence of anticompetitive withholding of natural gas pipeline capacity on Algonquin Gas Transmission by New England shippers.”  It said that following an extensive review Commission staff “determined that EDF’s study was flawed and led to incorrect conclusions about the alleged withholding.”<ref>{{Cite press release |title=FERC Staff Inquiry Finds No Withholding of Pipeline Capacity in New England Markets |date=February 27, 2018 |publisher=Federal Energy Regulatory Commission |url=https://www.ferc.gov/media/news-releases/2018/2018-1/02-27-18.asp#.WriR2-jwbrc}}</ref>

'''Proslavery''' is an [[ideology]] that perceives [[slavery]] as a [[Slavery as a positive good |positive good]].

==Ancient and medieval views==
[[Aristotle]] claimed that some people were [[natural slavery|natural slaves]], and as a result of this belief, he argued that their enslavement was the only way to serve their best interests. He wrote in book I of the [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]: <blockquote>Accordingly, those who are as different [from other men] as the soul from the body or man from beast—and they are in this state if their work is the use of the body, and if this is the best that can come from them—are slaves by nature. For them it is better to be ruled in accordance with this sort of rule, if such is the case for the other things mentioned. For he is a slave by nature who is capable of belonging to another–which is also why he belongs to another–and who participates in reason only to the extent of perceiving it, but does not have it.<ref name=\"Aristotle\">[[Aristotle]], ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', 1254b16–21; in: {{cite book|author=Aristotle|title=The Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEwLXFyp0ccC&pg=PA41|year=1985|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-02670-1|page=41|translator=Carnes Lord}}</ref></blockquote>

Among the [[Church Fathers]], the majority opinion was in favour of the moral permissibility of slavery.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=De Wet|first=C.L.|date=2016-10-17|title=The punishment of slaves in early Christianity: the views of some selected church fathers|url=https://www.ajol.info/index.php/actat/article/view/146051|journal=Acta Theologica|volume=23|issue=1|pages=263|doi=10.4314/actat.v23i1S.13|issn=1015-8758}}</ref> According to [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], God approved of the [[Flagellation|flogging]] of disobedient slaves: \"You must use the whip, use it! God allows it. Rather, he is angered if you do not lash the slave. But do it in a loving and not a cruel spirit.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> [[John Chrysostom]] wrote that \"to discipline and punish ignorant slaves is a great accolade, and not a perchance commendation\".<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Tertullian]] condemned the [[Marcionism|Marcionites]] for their advocacy of the liberation of slaves: \"what is more unrighteous, more unjust, more dishonest, than to benefit a foreign slave in such a way as to take him away from his master, claim him who is someone else's property\".<ref name=\":0\" />

[[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that slavery was not part of [[natural law]], but nonetheless he defended it as a consequence of human sinfulness and necessary for the good of society. He viewed the natural state of humanity as that which had existed prior to the [[fall of man]], in which slavery was non-existent; on those grounds, many commentators see him as rejecting Aristotle's claim that some people were naturally slaves, although it is a matter of controversy as to whether he fully rejected Aristotle's views on the matter.<ref name=\"KretzmannStump1993\">{{cite book|author1=Norman Kretzmann|author2=Eleonore Stump|title=The Cambridge Companion to Aquinas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fi4rA6LQN5sC&pg=PA226|date=28 May 1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43769-1|pages=222–226}}</ref>

==John Locke==
[[John Locke]] discusses slavery in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise of Government]]''. He rejects the idea that a person could voluntarily consent to enslavement, saying \"a man, not having the power of his own life, ''cannot'', by compact or by his own consent, ''enslave himself'' to any one, nor put himself under the absolute, arbitrary power of another\" (emphasis in original).<ref name=\"Locke1821\">{{cite book|author=John Locke|title=Two treatises of government|url=https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofg00lockuoft|year=1821|publisher=Whitmore and Fenn, and C. Brown|page=[https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofg00lockuoft/page/206 206]|orig-year=First published 1690}}</ref> However, he goes on to argue that enslavement of those who are guilty of [[capital offence]]s is permissible.<ref name=\"Locke1821\" /> He also defends the enslavement of those captured in war: \"This is the perfect condition of ''slavery'', which is nothing else, but ''the state of war continued, between a lawful conqueror and a captive''\" (emphasis in original).<ref name=\"Locke1821a\">{{cite book|author=John Locke|title=Two treatises of government|url=https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofg00lockuoft|year=1821|publisher=Whitmore and Fenn, and C. Brown|page=[https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofg00lockuoft/page/207 207]|orig-year=First published 1690}}</ref>

James Farr describes John Locke as \"a merchant adventurer in the African slave trade and an instrument of English colonial policy who proposed legislation [the [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]]] to ensure that 'every freeman of Carolina shall have absolute power and authority over his negro slaves'\".<ref name=\"Farr1986\">{{cite journal|issn=0090-5917|jstor=191463|author=James Farr|journal=[[Political Theory (journal)|Political Theory]]|number=2|pages=263–289|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|Sage Publications, Inc.]]|title=\"So Vile and Miserable an Estate\": The Problem of Slavery in Locke's Political Thought|volume=14|year=1986}}</ref> Farr argues that Locke's theoretical justifications of slavery were inadequate to justify his practical involvement in the enslavement of Africans. He sees this contradiction as ultimately unsolvable:
<blockquote>Locke never addressed, much less resolved, this contradiction. On Afro-American slavery, silence seems to have been his principal bequest to posterity. Locke's silence is all the more difficult to fathom inasmuch as in the ''Two Treatises'' he developed a general theory and justification of slavery for captives taken in a just war ... I hope to show that this theory is woefully inadequate as an account of Afro-American slavery and, further, that ''Locke knew this'' ... Locke's silence about the Afro-American slave practices that he helped forward remains profoundly unsettling and poses one of the greatest problems for understanding Locke as a theorist and political actor<ref name=\"Farr1986\" /></blockquote>
While Locke criticised slavery as \"so vile and miserable an estate of man\",<ref>{{cite book|author=John Locke|title=Two treatises of government|url=https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofg00lockuoft|year=1821|publisher=Whitmore and Fenn, and C. Brown|page=[https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofg00lockuoft/page/n30 1]|orig-year=First published 1690}}</ref> Farr argues that this statement was meant primarily as a condemnation of the enslavement of the English (which Locke accused advocates of [[absolute monarchy]] as effectively proposing), not necessarily as a judgement of the African slave trade.

==Islamic views==
{{Further|Islamic views on slavery|Slavery in 21st-century Islamism}}
While [[Islam]] traditionally permits slavery, most contemporary Islamic authorities argue that the practice is inapplicable in the modern world. However, a minority of contemporary Islamic jurists defend slavery by arguing that it is still relevant and permissible today, and it is actively practiced by [[Islamism|Islamist]] extremist groups.<ref>Bernard K. Freamon, [http://fordhamilj.org/files/2015/12/FREAMON_IsisBokoHaramandthehumanrighttofreedom.pdf Isis, Boko Haram, and the Human Right to Freedom from Slavery Under Islamic Law], 39 Fordham Int'l L.J. 245 (2015)</ref>

==In the British Empire==
The British proslavery movement opposed the abolition of the slave trade – from when the campaign for its abolition first began in 1783 until its victory in 1807 – and then opposed the abolition of slavery itself in British colonies until that was achieved in 1833. Most of the British defenders of slavery were absentee owners of plantations in the [[British West Indies]] who economically benefited from the continuation of the institution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/campaignforabolition/sources/proslavery/proslaverysources.html|title=Pro-slavery sources|website=www.bl.uk|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/slavery/|title=How did the Abolition Acts of 1807 and 1833 affect the slave trade?|date=|website=The National Archives|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>

Paula E. Dumas, in her study of the history of the British proslavery movement, draws a distinction between anti-abolitionist and proslavery positions: \"Anti-abolition arguments in this period focused on defects in the abolitionist platform, emphasising the illegal, illogical, inhumane, or pro-French nature of their aims. Proslavery arguments, on the other hand, positively promoted slavery and the slave trade\". Dumas notes that proslavery (as opposed to anti-abolitionist) positions largely disappeared from the British Parliament after the 1807 abolition of the slave trade.<ref name=\"Dumas2016\">{{cite book|author=Paula E. Dumas|title=Proslavery Britain: Fighting for Slavery in an Era of Abolition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c__MCwAAQBAJ|date=15 March 2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-1-137-55858-9}}</ref>{{rp|3}} However, other authors do not so clearly draw such a distinction and include what Dumas calls anti-abolitionism in the topic of proslavery.

Dumas traces the beginning of organised British proslavery to 1787, when the [[London Society of West India Planters and Merchants]] formed a subcommittee to organise opposition to abolitionism.<ref name=\"Dumas2016\"/>{{rp|10}}

British proslavery thinkers defended slavery on the basis of the Bible. General [[Isaac Gascoyne]] MP gave a speech to the House of Commons on 10 June 1806 in which he argued that slavery was authorised by Leviticus 25:44-46.<ref name=\"Dumas2016\"/>{{rp|40}} Similarly, on 23 February 1807, [[George Hibbert]] MP gave a speech to the House of Commons defending slavery on the basis of the Old Testament and the Epistle to Philemon.<ref name=\"Dumas2016\"/>{{rp|41}} Dumas notes that attempts to directly defend slavery on the basis of the Bible largely disappeared following the 1807 abolition of the slave trade, but its defenders still drew on religious arguments, such that the institution of slavery (allegedly) benefited slaves by encouraging them to convert to Christianity.<ref name=\"Dumas2016\"/>{{rp|41}}

After the abolition of the slave trade, British defenders of slavery drew a distinction between slavery itself and the slave trade, acknowledging the latter to be prohibited by the Bible (in particular, Exodus 21:6, Deut 24:7, 1 Tim 1:9-10), but arguing that the Bible permitted the former.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Michael|date=2016-01-02|title=British Proslavery Arguments and the Bible, 1823–1833|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0144039X.2015.1093394|journal=Slavery & Abolition|volume=37|issue=1|pages=139–158|doi=10.1080/0144039X.2015.1093394|issn=0144-039X}}</ref>

The American proslavery movement drew at times on the British proslavery movement as support. For example, [[Thomas Roderick Dew]], in an essay published in September 1832, quoted approvingly British Foreign Secretary (and later Prime Minister) [[George Canning]]'s speech to the House of Commons of 16 March 1824 opposing abolition, in which he compared emancipated slaves to Shelley's Frankenstein.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rugemer|first=Edward B.|date=2004-05-01|title=The Southern Response to British Abolitionism: The Maturation of Proslavery Apologetics|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/27648398?origin=crossref|journal=The Journal of Southern History|language=en|volume=70|issue=2|pages=221|doi=10.2307/27648398}}</ref>

==In the United States==
{{also|Treatment of slaves in the United States}}
In the United States, pro-slavery sentiment arose in the [[Antebellum South|antebellum]] period as a reaction to the growing [[abolitionism in the United States|antislavery]] movement in the United States in the late 18th century and early 19th century. [[Zephaniah Kingsley]] is the author of [[A Treatise on the Patriarchal, or Co-operative System of Society|the most popular pro-slavery tract]], self-published in 1828 and reprinted three times. In 1846, Matthew Estes published  ''A defence of Negro slavery, as it exists in the United States''.<ref>{{cite book

The authors are [[William Harper (South Carolina)|William Harper]], a South Carolina jurist and politician, [[James Henry Hammond]], South Carolina governor and then senator, [[J. Marion Sims]], an Alabama physician, and [[Thomas Roderick Dew]], president of the [[College of William & Mary]].

Pro-slavery apologists fought against the abolitionists with their own promotion, which invariably stressed their view that slaves were both well treated and happy, and included illustrations which were designed to prove their points.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Freedom on my mind|last = white|first = Deborah|publisher = Mary.

Larry E. Tise argues against what he believes is the mistaken position that proslavery thought was unique to the antebellum American South:
<blockquote>Among the numerous myths perpetuated by traditional interpretations of proslavery history, none has stood on shakier ground or proved more misleading than the notion that, for all practical purposes, proslavery was a phenomenon that appeared only in the antebellum South. From the age of the abolitionist through recent historiography the impression has remained that the Old South alone deserved the dubious distinction of fostering proslavery thought and building a culture largely defined by its buttressing of slavery.<ref name=\"Tise1990\">{{cite book|author=Larry E.

Tise goes on to describe in detail the history of proslavery thought in the British West Indies and the broader British Empire. He argues that the debate over slavery is more accurately seen, not as something exclusively American, but as a debate occurring throughout the English-speaking world.<ref name=\"Tise1990\"/>

===Abolitionism in the United States===
{{main|Abolitionism in the United States}}
Until the middle of the 18th century, slavery was practiced with little challenge anywhere in the world.  For centuries philosophers as varied as [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[John Locke]] accepted slavery as part of a proper social system. However, across Europe through the last part of the 18th century there were intellectual antislavery arguments based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, as well as moral arguments (notably among [[Quakers]], in Great Britain and the United States) which questioned the legitimacy of slavery. Only in the [[American Revolution|American Revolutionary War]] era did slavery first become a significant social issue in North America.<ref>Kolchin (2003) pp. 63-64</ref> In the North, beginning during the Revolution and continuing through the first decade of the next century, state by state emancipation was achieved by legislation or lawsuit<ref>African Americans and the End of slavery in Massachusetts http://www.masshist.org/endofslavery/index.php?id=54,</ref> although in the larger slaveholding states such as New York and Pennsylvania emancipation was gradual. By 1810, 75% of Northern slaves had been freed and virtually all were freed within the next generation.<ref>Kolchin (2003) p. 78</ref>

In the United States, the antislavery contention that slavery was both economically inefficient and socially detrimental{{how|date=August 2019}} to the country as a whole was more prevalent than philosophical and moral arguments against slavery.<ref>Kolchin (2003) pp. 65-68</ref> In Virginia, as the economy shifted away from tobacco towards less labor-intensive wheat crops, more slaves were freed between 1783 and 1812 than any time until 1865.  There was the potential, in many Southern minds, for a relatively short transition away from slavery.  However this perspective rapidly changed as the worldwide demand for sugar and cotton from America increased and the [[Louisiana Purchase]] opened up vast new territories ideally suited for a plantation economy.<ref>Wilentz (2005) pp. 218-220</ref>

Only in the early 19th century did abolitionist movements gather momentum, and many countries abolished slavery in the first half of the 19th century. The increasing rarity of slavery, combined with an increase in the number of slaves caused by a boom in the cotton trade, drew attention and criticism to the [[Southern United States|Southern states']] continuation of slavery. Faced with this growing 'antislavery' movement, slaveholders and their sympathizers began to articulate an explicit defense of slavery.

===Political proslavery===
[[Image:JHHammond.jpg|thumb|left|189px|James Henry Hammond]]
The famous ''Mudsill Speech (1858)'' of [[James Henry Hammond]] and [[John C. Calhoun]]'s [[s:Slavery a Positive Good|Speech to the U.S. Senate (1837)]]  articulated the pro-slavery political argument during the period at which the ideology was at its most mature (late 1830s – early 1860s). These pro-slavery theorists championed a class-sensitive view of American antebellum society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerome Hampton|first1=Gregory|title=magining Slaves and Robots in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-9146-0|page=25}}</ref> They felt that the bane of many past societies was the existence of the class of the landless poor. Southern pro-slavery theorists felt that this class of landless poor was inherently transient and easily manipulated, and as such often destabilized society as a whole. Thus, the greatest threat to democracy was seen as coming from class warfare that destabilized a nation's economy, society, government, and threatened the peaceful and harmonious implementation of laws.

This theory supposes that there must be, and supposedly always has been, a lower class for the upper classes to rest upon: the metaphor of a [[mudsill theory]] being that the lowest threshold (mudsill) supports the foundation for a building. This theory was used by its composer, Senator and Governor James Henry Hammond, a wealthy Southern plantation owner, to justify what he saw as the willingness of the non-whites to perform menial work which enabled the higher classes to move civilization forward. With this in mind, any efforts for class or racial equality that ran counter to the theory would inevitably run counter to [[civilization]] itself.

Southern pro-slavery theorists asserted that slavery eliminated this problem by elevating all free people to the status of \"citizen\", and removing the landless poor (the \"mudsill\") from the political process entirely by means of enslavement. Thus, those who would most threaten economic stability and political harmony were not allowed to undermine a democratic society, because they were not allowed to participate in it. So, in the mindset of pro-slavery men, slavery was for protecting the common good of slaves, masters, and society as a whole.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerome Hampton|first1=Gregory|title=Imagining Slaves and Robots in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=Lexington Book|isbn=978-0-7391-9146-0|page=25}}</ref>

These and other arguments fought for the rights of the propertied elite against what were perceived as threats from the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], lower classes, and non-whites to gain higher [[standards of living]]. The economic self-interest of slaveholders certainly played a role, as slaves represented a massive amount of wealth – at the time of the Civil War some historians estimate the over 20% of private wealth in the US was slaves.<ref>Piketty, Thomas. \"Capital in the Twenty-First Century.\" Harvard University Press, 2014 067443000X, 9780674430006</ref>  They saw the abolition of slavery as a threat to their powerful Southern economy: an economy that revolved almost entirely around the plantation system and was supported by the use of black slaves.

===Proslavery Christians===
{{Further|The Bible and slavery|Christian views on slavery|Curse of Ham|Curse and mark of Cain}}
Passages in the [[Bible]] which justify and regulate the institution of slavery have been used as a justification for the keeping of slaves throughout history, and they have also been used as a source of guidance on how it should be done. Therefore, when abolition was proposed, many Christians spoke vociferously against it, citing the Bible's acceptance of slavery as 'proof' that it was part of the normal condition. [[George Whitefield]], who is famed for his sparking of the ''Great Awakening'' of American evangelicalism, campaigned, in the [[Province of Georgia]], for the legalisation of slavery,<ref name=Cashin>Edward J. Cashin, ''Beloved Bethesda : A History of George Whitefield's Home for Boys'' (2001)</ref><ref>Arnold Dallimore, ''George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century'' (1980), Volume 2</ref>  joining the ranks of the slave owners who he had denounced in his earlier years, while contending that slaves had souls and opposing their mistreatment by owners who resisted his evangelism to slaves.<ref>{{cite web|last=Piper|first=John|title=I Will Not Be a Velvet-Mouthed Preacher!|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/biographies/i-will-not-be-a-velvet-mouthed-preacher|work=February 3, 2009|accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref>  Slavery had been outlawed in Georgia, but it was legalised in 1751 due in large part to Whitefield's efforts. He bought enslaved Africans and put them to work on his plantation as well as at the [[Bethesda Orphanage]] which he established. [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], who played a major role in financing and guiding early Methodism, inherited these slaves and kept them in bondage.<ref name=Cashin/>

In both Europe and the United States many Christians went further, arguing that slavery was actually justified by the words and doctrines of the Bible.

===Proslavery views in the 20th century===
In the 20th century, the American philosopher [[Robert Nozick]] defended the notion of [[voluntary slavery]], whereby persons voluntarily sell themselves into slavery. In ''[[Anarchy, State and Utopia]]'', Nozick writes that \"The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery. I believe that it would.\"<ref name=\"Nozick2013\">{{citation|author=Robert Nozick|title=Anarchy, State, and Utopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVITAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT192|year=2013|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-06374-1|page=192}}</ref> Commenting on Nozick's views, [[David Ellerman]] (writing under the pseudonym \"J.

XIV, n. 1, Fall 1982, p.46; [http://www.ellerman.org/the-libertarian-case-for-slavery-a-note-on-nozick/ available online]</ref>

Another 20th-century advocate of legal slavery was [[Rousas Rushdoony]]. Rushdoony, an adherent of [[theonomy]], believed that [[Old Testament]] laws should be applied in the present day, including those laws which permitted slavery. Unlike Nozick, who believed that slavery should be limited to those who voluntarily agreed to it, Rushdoony supported the forcible enslavement of all who rejected Christianity.<ref name=\"Rushdoony1973\">{{citation|author=R.J.

'''Proslavery''' is an [[ideology]] that perceives [[slavery]] as a [[Slavery as a positive good |positive good]].

==Ancient and medieval views==
[[Aristotle]] claimed that some people were [[natural slavery|natural slaves]], and as a result of this belief, he argued that their enslavement was the only way to serve their best interests. He wrote in book I of the [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]: <blockquote>Accordingly, those who are as different [from other men] as the soul from the body or man from beast—and they are in this state if their work is the use of the body, and if this is the best that can come from them—are slaves by nature. For them it is better to be ruled in accordance with this sort of rule, if such is the case for the other things mentioned. For he is a slave by nature who is capable of belonging to another–which is also why he belongs to another–and who participates in reason only to the extent of perceiving it, but does not have it.<ref name=\"Aristotle\">[[Aristotle]], ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', 1254b16–21; in: {{cite book|author=Aristotle|title=The Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEwLXFyp0ccC&pg=PA41|year=1985|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-02670-1|page=41|translator=Carnes Lord}}</ref></blockquote>

Among the [[Church Fathers]], the majority opinion was in favour of the moral permissibility of slavery.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=De Wet|first=C.L.|date=2016-10-17|title=The punishment of slaves in early Christianity: the views of some selected church fathers|url=https://www.ajol.info/index.php/actat/article/view/146051|journal=Acta Theologica|volume=23|issue=1|pages=263|doi=10.4314/actat.v23i1S.13|issn=1015-8758}}</ref> According to [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], God approved of the [[Flagellation|flogging]] of disobedient slaves: \"You must use the whip, use it! God allows it. Rather, he is angered if you do not lash the slave. But do it in a loving and not a cruel spirit.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> [[John Chrysostom]] wrote that \"to discipline and punish ignorant slaves is a great accolade, and not a perchance commendation\".<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Tertullian]] condemned the [[Marcionism|Marcionites]] for their advocacy of the liberation of slaves: \"what is more unrighteous, more unjust, more dishonest, than to benefit a foreign slave in such a way as to take him away from his master, claim him who is someone else's property\".<ref name=\":0\" />

[[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that slavery was not part of [[natural law]], but nonetheless he defended it as a consequence of human sinfulness and necessary for the good of society. He viewed the natural state of humanity as that which had existed prior to the [[fall of man]], in which slavery was non-existent; on those grounds, many commentators see him as rejecting Aristotle's claim that some people were naturally slaves, although it is a matter of controversy as to whether he fully rejected Aristotle's views on the matter.<ref name=\"KretzmannStump1993\">{{cite book|author1=Norman Kretzmann|author2=Eleonore Stump|title=The Cambridge Companion to Aquinas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fi4rA6LQN5sC&pg=PA226|date=28 May 1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43769-1|pages=222–226}}</ref>

==John Locke==
[[John Locke]] discusses slavery in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise of Government]]''. He rejects the idea that a person could voluntarily consent to enslavement, saying \"a man, not having the power of his own life, ''cannot'', by compact or by his own consent, ''enslave himself'' to any one, nor put himself under the absolute, arbitrary power of another\" (emphasis in original).<ref name=\"Locke1821\">{{cite book|author=John Locke|title=Two treatises of government|url=https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofg00lockuoft|year=1821|publisher=Whitmore and Fenn, and C. Brown|page=[https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofg00lockuoft/page/206 206]|orig-year=First published 1690}}</ref> However, he goes on to argue that enslavement of those who are guilty of [[capital offence]]s is permissible.<ref name=\"Locke1821\" /> He also defends the enslavement of those captured in war: \"This is the perfect condition of ''slavery'', which is nothing else, but ''the state of war continued, between a lawful conqueror and a captive''\" (emphasis in original).<ref name=\"Locke1821a\">{{cite book|author=John Locke|title=Two treatises of government|url=https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofg00lockuoft|year=1821|publisher=Whitmore and Fenn, and C. Brown|page=[https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofg00lockuoft/page/207 207]|orig-year=First published 1690}}</ref>

James Farr describes John Locke as \"a merchant adventurer in the African slave trade and an instrument of English colonial policy who proposed legislation [the [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]]] to ensure that 'every freeman of Carolina shall have absolute power and authority over his negro slaves'\".<ref name=\"Farr1986\">{{cite journal|issn=0090-5917|jstor=191463|author=James Farr|journal=[[Political Theory (journal)|Political Theory]]|number=2|pages=263–289|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|Sage Publications, Inc.]]|title=\"So Vile and Miserable an Estate\": The Problem of Slavery in Locke's Political Thought|volume=14|year=1986}}</ref> Farr argues that Locke's theoretical justifications of slavery were inadequate to justify his practical involvement in the enslavement of Africans. He sees this contradiction as ultimately unsolvable:
<blockquote>Locke never addressed, much less resolved, this contradiction. On Afro-American slavery, silence seems to have been his principal bequest to posterity. Locke's silence is all the more difficult to fathom inasmuch as in the ''Two Treatises'' he developed a general theory and justification of slavery for captives taken in a just war ... I hope to show that this theory is woefully inadequate as an account of Afro-American slavery and, further, that ''Locke knew this'' ... Locke's silence about the Afro-American slave practices that he helped forward remains profoundly unsettling and poses one of the greatest problems for understanding Locke as a theorist and political actor<ref name=\"Farr1986\" /></blockquote>
While Locke criticised slavery as \"so vile and miserable an estate of man\",<ref>{{cite book|author=John Locke|title=Two treatises of government|url=https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofg00lockuoft|year=1821|publisher=Whitmore and Fenn, and C. Brown|page=[https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofg00lockuoft/page/n30 1]|orig-year=First published 1690}}</ref> Farr argues that this statement was meant primarily as a condemnation of the enslavement of the English (which Locke accused advocates of [[absolute monarchy]] as effectively proposing), not necessarily as a judgement of the African slave trade.

==Islamic views==
{{Further|Islamic views on slavery|Slavery in 21st-century Islamism}}
While [[Islam]] traditionally permits slavery, most contemporary Islamic authorities argue that the practice is inapplicable in the modern world. However, a minority of contemporary Islamic jurists defend slavery by arguing that it is still relevant and permissible today, and it is actively practiced by [[Islamism|Islamist]] extremist groups.<ref>Bernard K. Freamon, [http://fordhamilj.org/files/2015/12/FREAMON_IsisBokoHaramandthehumanrighttofreedom.pdf Isis, Boko Haram, and the Human Right to Freedom from Slavery Under Islamic Law], 39 Fordham Int'l L.J. 245 (2015)</ref>

==In the British Empire==
The British proslavery movement opposed the abolition of the slave trade – from when the campaign for its abolition first began in 1783 until its victory in 1807 – and then opposed the abolition of slavery itself in British colonies until that was achieved in 1833. Most of the British defenders of slavery were absentee owners of plantations in the [[British West Indies]] who economically benefited from the continuation of the institution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/campaignforabolition/sources/proslavery/proslaverysources.html|title=Pro-slavery sources|website=www.bl.uk|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/slavery/|title=How did the Abolition Acts of 1807 and 1833 affect the slave trade?|date=|website=The National Archives|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>

Paula E. Dumas, in her study of the history of the British proslavery movement, draws a distinction between anti-abolitionist and proslavery positions: \"Anti-abolition arguments in this period focused on defects in the abolitionist platform, emphasising the illegal, illogical, inhumane, or pro-French nature of their aims. Proslavery arguments, on the other hand, positively promoted slavery and the slave trade\". Dumas notes that proslavery (as opposed to anti-abolitionist) positions largely disappeared from the British Parliament after the 1807 abolition of the slave trade.<ref name=\"Dumas2016\">{{cite book|author=Paula E. Dumas|title=Proslavery Britain: Fighting for Slavery in an Era of Abolition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c__MCwAAQBAJ|date=15 March 2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-1-137-55858-9}}</ref>{{rp|3}} However, other authors do not so clearly draw such a distinction and include what Dumas calls anti-abolitionism in the topic of proslavery.

Dumas traces the beginning of organised British proslavery to 1787, when the [[London Society of West India Planters and Merchants]] formed a subcommittee to organise opposition to abolitionism.<ref name=\"Dumas2016\"/>{{rp|10}}

British proslavery thinkers defended slavery on the basis of the Bible. General [[Isaac Gascoyne]] MP gave a speech to the House of Commons on 10 June 1806 in which he argued that slavery was authorised by Leviticus 25:44-46.<ref name=\"Dumas2016\"/>{{rp|40}} Similarly, on 23 February 1807, [[George Hibbert]] MP gave a speech to the House of Commons defending slavery on the basis of the Old Testament and the Epistle to Philemon.<ref name=\"Dumas2016\"/>{{rp|41}} Dumas notes that attempts to directly defend slavery on the basis of the Bible largely disappeared following the 1807 abolition of the slave trade, but its defenders still drew on religious arguments, such that the institution of slavery (allegedly) benefited slaves by encouraging them to convert to Christianity.<ref name=\"Dumas2016\"/>{{rp|41}}

After the abolition of the slave trade, British defenders of slavery drew a distinction between slavery itself and the slave trade, acknowledging the latter to be prohibited by the Bible (in particular, Exodus 21:6, Deut 24:7, 1 Tim 1:9-10), but arguing that the Bible permitted the former.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Michael|date=2016-01-02|title=British Proslavery Arguments and the Bible, 1823–1833|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0144039X.2015.1093394|journal=Slavery & Abolition|volume=37|issue=1|pages=139–158|doi=10.1080/0144039X.2015.1093394|issn=0144-039X}}</ref>

The American proslavery movement drew at times on the British proslavery movement as support. For example, [[Thomas Roderick Dew]], in an essay published in September 1832, quoted approvingly British Foreign Secretary (and later Prime Minister) [[George Canning]]'s speech to the House of Commons of 16 March 1824 opposing abolition, in which he compared emancipated slaves to Shelley's Frankenstein.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rugemer|first=Edward B.|date=2004-05-01|title=The Southern Response to British Abolitionism: The Maturation of Proslavery Apologetics|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/27648398?origin=crossref|journal=The Journal of Southern History|language=en|volume=70|issue=2|pages=221|doi=10.2307/27648398}}</ref>

==In the United States==

In the United States, pro-slavery sentiment arose in the [[Antebellum South|antebellum]] period as a reaction to the growing [[abolitionism in the United States|antislavery]] movement in the United States in the late 18th century and early 19th century. [[Zephaniah Kingsley]] is the author of [[A Treatise on the Patriarchal, or Co-operative System of Society|the most popular pro-slavery tract]], self-published in 1828 and reprinted three times. In 1846, Matthew Estes published  ''A defence of Negro slavery, as it exists in the United States''.<ref>{{cite book

Pro-slavery apologists fought against the abolitionists with their own promotion, which invariably stressed their view that slaves were both well treated and happy, and included illustrations which were designed to prove their points.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Freedom on my mind|last = white|first = Deborah|publisher = Mary.

Larry E. Tise argues against what he believes is the mistaken position that proslavery thought was unique to the antebellum American South:
<blockquote>Among the numerous myths perpetuated by traditional interpretations of proslavery history, none has stood on shakier ground or proved more misleading than the notion that, for all practical purposes, proslavery was a phenomenon that appeared only in the antebellum South. From the age of the abolitionist through recent historiography the impression has remained that the Old South alone deserved the dubious distinction of fostering proslavery thought and building a culture largely defined by its buttressing of slavery.<ref name=\"Tise1990\">{{cite book|author=Larry E. Tise|title=Proslavery: A History of the Defense of Slavery in America, 1701-1840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvWA08GsAAwC&pg=PA75|date=1 October 1990|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-2396-1|page=75}}</ref></blockquote>
Tise goes on to describe in detail the history of proslavery thought in the British West Indies and the broader British Empire. He argues that the debate over slavery is more accurately seen, not as something exclusively American, but as a debate occurring throughout the English-speaking world.<ref name=\"Tise1990\"/>

===Abolitionism in the United States===
{{main|Abolitionism in the United States}}
Until the middle of the 18th century, slavery was practiced with little challenge anywhere in the world.  For centuries philosophers as varied as [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[John Locke]] accepted slavery as part of a proper social system. However, across Europe through the last part of the 18th century there were intellectual antislavery arguments based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, as well as moral arguments (notably among [[Quakers]], in Great Britain and the United States) which questioned the legitimacy of slavery. Only in the [[American Revolution|American Revolutionary War]] era did slavery first become a significant social issue in North America.<ref>Kolchin (2003) pp. 63-64</ref> In the North, beginning during the Revolution and continuing through the first decade of the next century, state by state emancipation was achieved by legislation or lawsuit<ref>African Americans and the End of slavery in Massachusetts http://www.masshist.org/endofslavery/index.php?id=54,</ref> although in the larger slaveholding states such as New York and Pennsylvania emancipation was gradual. By 1810, 75% of Northern slaves had been freed and virtually all were freed within the next generation.<ref>Kolchin (2003) p. 78</ref>

In the United States, the antislavery contention that slavery was both economically inefficient and socially detrimental{{how|date=August 2019}} to the country as a whole was more prevalent than philosophical and moral arguments against slavery.<ref>Kolchin (2003) pp. 65-68</ref> In Virginia, as the economy shifted away from tobacco towards less labor-intensive wheat crops, more slaves were freed between 1783 and 1812 than any time until 1865.  There was the potential, in many Southern minds, for a relatively short transition away from slavery.  However this perspective rapidly changed as the worldwide demand for sugar and cotton from America increased and the [[Louisiana Purchase]] opened up vast new territories ideally suited for a plantation economy.<ref>Wilentz (2005) pp. 218-220</ref>

Only in the early 19th century did abolitionist movements gather momentum, and many countries abolished slavery in the first half of the 19th century. The increasing rarity of slavery, combined with an increase in the number of slaves caused by a boom in the cotton trade, drew attention and criticism to the [[Southern United States|Southern states']] continuation of slavery. Faced with this growing 'antislavery' movement, slaveholders and their sympathizers began to articulate an explicit defense of slavery.

===Political proslavery===
[[Image:JHHammond.jpg|thumb|left|189px|James Henry Hammond]]
The famous ''Mudsill Speech (1858)'' of [[James Henry Hammond]] and [[John C. Calhoun]]'s [[s:Slavery a Positive Good|Speech to the U.S. Senate (1837)]]  articulated the pro-slavery political argument during the period at which the ideology was at its most mature (late 1830s – early 1860s). These pro-slavery theorists championed a class-sensitive view of American antebellum society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerome Hampton|first1=Gregory|title=magining Slaves and Robots in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-9146-0|page=25}}</ref> They felt that the bane of many past societies was the existence of the class of the landless poor. Southern pro-slavery theorists felt that this class of landless poor was inherently transient and easily manipulated, and as such often destabilized society as a whole. Thus, the greatest threat to democracy was seen as coming from class warfare that destabilized a nation's economy, society, government, and threatened the peaceful and harmonious implementation of laws.

This theory supposes that there must be, and supposedly always has been, a lower class for the upper classes to rest upon: the metaphor of a [[mudsill theory]] being that the lowest threshold (mudsill) supports the foundation for a building. This theory was used by its composer, Senator and Governor James Henry Hammond, a wealthy Southern plantation owner, to justify what he saw as the willingness of the non-whites to perform menial work which enabled the higher classes to move civilization forward. With this in mind, any efforts for class or racial equality that ran counter to the theory would inevitably run counter to [[civilization]] itself.

Southern pro-slavery theorists asserted that slavery eliminated this problem by elevating all free people to the status of \"citizen\", and removing the landless poor (the \"mudsill\") from the political process entirely by means of enslavement. Thus, those who would most threaten economic stability and political harmony were not allowed to undermine a democratic society, because they were not allowed to participate in it. So, in the mindset of pro-slavery men, slavery was for protecting the common good of slaves, masters, and society as a whole.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerome Hampton|first1=Gregory|title=Imagining Slaves and Robots in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=Lexington Book|isbn=978-0-7391-9146-0|page=25}}</ref>

These and other arguments fought for the rights of the propertied elite against what were perceived as threats from the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], lower classes, and non-whites to gain higher [[standards of living]]. The economic self-interest of slaveholders certainly played a role, as slaves represented a massive amount of wealth – at the time of the Civil War some historians estimate the over 20% of private wealth in the US was slaves.<ref>Piketty, Thomas. \"Capital in the Twenty-First Century.\" Harvard University Press, 2014 067443000X, 9780674430006</ref>  They saw the abolition of slavery as a threat to their powerful Southern economy: an economy that revolved almost entirely around the plantation system and was supported by the use of black slaves.

===Proslavery Christians===
{{Further|The Bible and slavery|Christian views on slavery|Curse of Ham|Curse and mark of Cain}}
Passages in the [[Bible]] which justify and regulate the institution of slavery have been used as a justification for the keeping of slaves throughout history, and they have also been used as a source of guidance on how it should be done. Therefore, when abolition was proposed, many Christians spoke vociferously against it, citing the Bible's acceptance of slavery as 'proof' that it was part of the normal condition. [[George Whitefield]], who is famed for his sparking of the ''Great Awakening'' of American evangelicalism, campaigned, in the [[Province of Georgia]], for the legalisation of slavery,<ref name=Cashin>Edward J. Cashin, ''Beloved Bethesda : A History of George Whitefield's Home for Boys'' (2001)</ref><ref>Arnold Dallimore, ''George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century'' (1980), Volume 2</ref>  joining the ranks of the slave owners who he had denounced in his earlier years, while contending that slaves had souls and opposing their mistreatment by owners who resisted his evangelism to slaves.<ref>{{cite web|last=Piper|first=John|title=I Will Not Be a Velvet-Mouthed Preacher!|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/biographies/i-will-not-be-a-velvet-mouthed-preacher|work=February 3, 2009|accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref>  Slavery had been outlawed in Georgia, but it was legalised in 1751 due in large part to Whitefield's efforts. He bought enslaved Africans and put them to work on his plantation as well as at the [[Bethesda Orphanage]] which he established. [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], who played a major role in financing and guiding early Methodism, inherited these slaves and kept them in bondage.<ref name=Cashin/>

In both Europe and the United States many Christians went further, arguing that slavery was actually justified by the words and doctrines of the Bible.

In 1837, Southerners in the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] denomination joined forces with conservative Northerners in order to drive the antislavery [[New School Presbyterians]] out of the denomination. In 1844, the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] split into Northern and Southern wings over the issue of slavery. In 1845, the [[Baptists]] in the South formed the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] due to disputes with Northern Baptists over slavery and missions.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Enduring Vision: A History of the American People |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2007 |author1=Paul S.

===Proslavery views in the 20th century===
In the 20th century, the American philosopher [[Robert Nozick]] defended the notion of [[voluntary slavery]], whereby persons voluntarily sell themselves into slavery. In ''[[Anarchy, State and Utopia]]'', Nozick writes that \"The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery. I believe that it would.\"<ref name=\"Nozick2013\">{{citation|author=Robert Nozick|title=Anarchy, State, and Utopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVITAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT192|year=2013|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-06374-1|page=192}}</ref> Commenting on Nozick's views, [[David Ellerman]] (writing under the pseudonym \"J. Philmore\") notes their parallels with provisions in the [[Institutes of Justinian]] which permit individuals to sell themselves into slavery.<ref>Philmore, J. \"The Libertarian Case For Slavery: A Note on Nozick\", ''[[The Philosophical Forum]]'', vol. XIV, n. 1, Fall 1982, p.46; [http://www.ellerman.org/the-libertarian-case-for-slavery-a-note-on-nozick/ available online]</ref>

Another 20th-century advocate of legal slavery was [[Rousas Rushdoony]]. Rushdoony, an adherent of [[theonomy]], believed that [[Old Testament]] laws should be applied in the present day, including those laws which permitted slavery. Unlike Nozick, who believed that slavery should be limited to those who voluntarily agreed to it, Rushdoony supported the forcible enslavement of all who rejected Christianity.<ref name=\"Rushdoony1973\">{{citation|author=R.J.

==History==
Indiana was admitted as a state to the United States on 11 December 1816, although much of its territory was still disputed or held by native peoples at that time. These indigenous claims were quickly reduced and removed by various treaties. The [[Treaty of St. Mary's (1818)#New Purchase Tract|1818 Treaty with the Delaware Indians]] brought most of central Indiana into state control, and [[Madison County, Indiana|Madison County]] was organized on a portion of that area. The lower portion of Madison County was quickly settled, and by the late 1820s the inhabitants were petitioning for a separate county government. Accordingly, a portion of the county was partitioned on 1 March 1828, to form Hancock County. Greenfield was named as the county seat on 11 April. The county name recognized [[John Hancock]], president of the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]], who had signed his name prominently to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776.<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The legislative branch of the county government; controls the county's spending and revenue collection. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve staggered four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name=inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html|title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=16 September 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name=inc2102>{{cite web|author=Indiana Code|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf|title=Title 2, Article 10, Section 2|accessdate=16 September 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered four-year terms. One commissioner serves as president. The commissioners carry out the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name=inc3623/><ref name=inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name=inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]]. They are elected to four-year terms. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name=inc2102/>

Hancock County is part of [[Indiana's 5th congressional district]]; [[Indiana Senate]] district 28;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/sos/elections/3006.htm|title=Indiana Senate Districts|publisher=State of Indiana|accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref> and [[Indiana House of Representatives]] districts 29 and 53.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/sos/elections/3005.htm|title=Indiana House Districts|publisher=State of Indiana|accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref>

=== Public health and law enforcement ===
On February 19, 2020, it was announced that Hancock County Prosecutor Brent Eaton intends to prosecute victims of drug overdoses with felony drug possession charges. To do so, his plan is to use the administration of [[Naloxone|Narcan]] (an overdose-reversal nasal spray) by a police officer as probable cause for search warrants requiring the overdose victim to provide an oral swab for law enforcement to aid in the county's prosecution of the victim for felony drug possession charges. In fact, Eaton created a one-page Hancock County Overdose Report form for officers to fill out when they turn in an affidavit for a search warrant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filtermag.org/overdose-prosecution-indiana-naloxone-hancock/|title=Naloxone Now Used as Evidence to Prosecute Indiana OD Victims|date=2020-02-19|website=Filter|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref>

==History==
Indiana was admitted as a state to the United States on 11 December 1816, although much of its territory was still disputed or held by native peoples at that time. These indigenous claims were quickly reduced and removed by various treaties. The [[Treaty of St. Mary's (1818)#New Purchase Tract|1818 Treaty with the Delaware Indians]] brought most of central Indiana into state control, and [[Madison County, Indiana|Madison County]] was organized on a portion of that area. The lower portion of Madison County was quickly settled, and by the late 1820s the inhabitants were petitioning for a separate county government. Accordingly, a portion of the county was partitioned on 1 March 1828, to form Hancock County. Greenfield was named as the county seat on 11 April. The county name recognized [[John Hancock]], president of the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]], who had signed his name prominently to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776.<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

'''County Council:''' The legislative branch of the county government; controls the county's spending and revenue collection. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve staggered four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name=inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html|title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=16 September 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name=inc2102>{{cite web|author=Indiana Code|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf|title=Title 2, Article 10, Section 2|accessdate=16 September 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered four-year terms. One commissioner serves as president. The commissioners carry out the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name=inc3623/><ref name=inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name=inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]].

=== Public health and law enforcement ===
On February 19, 2020, it was announced that Hancock County Prosecutor Brent Eaton intends to prosecute victims of drug overdoses with felony drug possession charges. To do so, his plan is to use the administration of [[Naloxone|Narcan]] (an overdose-reversal nasal spray) by a police officer as probable cause for search warrants requiring the overdose victim to provide an oral swab for law enforcement to aid in the county's prosecution of the victim for felony drug possession charges. In fact, Eaton created a one-page Hancock County Overdose Report form for officers to fill out when they turn in an affidavit for a search warrant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filtermag.org/overdose-prosecution-indiana-naloxone-hancock/|title=Naloxone Now Used as Evidence to Prosecute Indiana OD Victims|date=2020-02-19|website=Filter|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref>

The [[single-elimination tournament|knockout stage]] comprised the sixteen teams that advanced from the group stage of the tournament. There were three rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final. There was also a play-off to decide third and fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by thirty minutes of [[extra time]]; if scores were still level, there was a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] to determine who progressed to the next round. FIFA did abolish the [[golden goal]] rule in 2005.

The [[single-elimination tournament|knockout stage]] comprised the sixteen teams that advanced from the group stage of the tournament. There were three rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final. There was also a play-off to decide third and fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by thirty minutes of [[extra time]]; if scores were still level, there was a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] to determine who progressed to the next round. FIFA did abolish the [[golden goal]] rule in 2005.

\"'''A Rose for Emily'''\" is a [[short story]] by American author [[William Faulkner]], first published in April 30, 1930, in an issue of ''[[The Forum (defunct magazine)|The Forum]]''. The story takes place in Faulkner's fictional city Jefferson, Mississippi, in the southern county of [[Yoknapatawpha]]. It was Faulkner's first short story published in a national magazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~egjbp/faulkner/r_ss_roseforemily.html|title=WFotW ~ \"A Rose for Emily\": COMMENTARY & RESOURCES|website=www.mcsr.olemiss.edu|access-date=2017-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420052408/http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~egjbp/faulkner/r_ss_roseforemily.html|archive-date=2017-04-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Title==
[[Faulkner]]&nbsp;described the title \"A Rose For Emily\" as an [[allegorical]]&nbsp;title: this woman had undergone a great tragedy, and for this Faulkner pitied her. As a salute, he handed her a rose.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DFrtepkWqWoC&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=allegorical+title%3B+the+meaning+was,+here+was+a+woman+who+had+had+a+tragedy,+an+irrevocable+tragedy+and+nothing+could+be+done+about+it|title=Introducción a la narrative breve de William Faulkner|language=es|isbn=9788481217469|author1=Outón|first1=Cristina Blanco|year=1999}}</ref> The word \"rose\" in the title has multiple meanings to it. The rose may be seen as Homer, when interpreting the rose as a dried rose. Homer's body could be the dried rose, such as one that is pressed between the pages of a book, kept in perfect condition as Emily did with Homer's body.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Getty|first=Laura|date=Summer 2005|title=Faulkner's A ROSE FOR EMILY|url=http://mrsstaceybrown.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/4/4/12441735/rose_for_emily_literary_analysis.pdf|journal=The Explicator|volume=63|pages=230–234}}</ref> The rose also represents secrecy. Roses have been portrayed in Greek legends as a gift of secrecy and of confidentiality, known as ''[[sub rosa]]'', introducing that the rose is a symbol of silence between the narrator and Miss Emily, the narrator keeps Emily's secrets until her death.

==Plot summary==
The story opens with a brief first-person account of the funeral of [[Emily Grierson]], an elderly Southern woman whose funeral is the obligation of their small town. It then proceeds in a [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linear fashion]] to the narrator's recollections of Emily's archaic and increasingly strange behavior throughout the years. Emily is a member of a family of the [[antebellum South]]ern aristocracy. After the Civil War, the family falls into hard times. She and her father, the last two of the clan, continue to live as if in the past; Emily's father refuses for her to marry.  Her father dies when Emily is about the age of 30, which takes her by surprise. She refuses to give up his corpse, and the townspeople write it off as her grieving process. The townspeople pity Emily not only after her father's death but also during his life when he wouldn't let Emily marry. Emily depended heavily on her father, believing he would never leave her; he was all she had.

After her father's death, the only person seen moving about Emily's home is Tobe, a black man serving as Emily's butler. He is frequently seen entering and exiting the house for groceries. Although Emily did not have a strong relationship with her community, she did give art lessons to young children within her town at the age of forty. A prime reason why she gave art lessons was her financial problem since she was running out of money. The townspeople make cruel comments and nasty looks behind Miss Emily's back, as she wasn't respected in her town. With the acceptance of her father's death, Emily somewhat revives, even changing the style of her hair, and becomes friendly with Homer Barron. He is a Northern laborer who comes to town shortly after Mr. Grierson's death. The connection surprises some of the community while others are glad she is taking an interest; however, \"Homer likes men and claims that he is not a marrying man.\" <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\" /> This draws attention to Homer's questionable sexuality in the story. Emily shortly buys arsenic from a druggist in town, presumably to kill rats, however, the townspeople are convinced that she will use it to poison herself. Emily's distant cousins are called into town by the minister's wife to supervise Miss Emily and Homer Barron. Homer leaves town for some time, reputedly to give Emily a chance to get rid of her cousins, and returns three days later after the cousins have left. After he is observed entering Miss Emily's home one evening, Homer is never seen alive again.

Despite these turnabouts in her social status, Emily continues to behave mysteriously, as she had before her father died. Her reputation is such that the city council finds itself unable to confront her about a strong smell that has begun to emanate from the house. They believed Tobe was unable to maintain the house and something was rotting, unaware that a death has occurred.  Instead, the council decide to send men to her house under the cover of darkness to sprinkle lime around the house, after which the smell dissipates. The mayor of the town, [[Colonel (title)|Colonel]] Sartorius, makes a [[gentleman's agreement]] to overlook her taxes as an act of charity, though it is done under a pretense of repayment towards her father, to assuage Emily's pride after her father's death. Years later, when the next generation has come to power, Emily insists on this informal arrangement, flatly refusing that she owes any taxes, stating \"I have no taxes in Jefferson.\" After this, the council declines to press the issue due to her stubbornness. Emily has become a [[recluse]]: she is never seen outside of the house, and only rarely accepts people into it. The community eventually comes to view her as a \"hereditary obligation\" on the town, who must be humored and tolerated.

The funeral is a large affair: Emily had become an institution, so her death sparks a great deal of curiosity about her reclusive nature and what remains of her house. After she is buried, a group of townsfolk enters her house to see what remains of her life there. Tobe walked out of the house and was never seen again, giving the townspeople access to Miss Emily's home. The door to her upstairs bedroom is locked, and some of the townsfolk break down the door to see what has been hidden for so long. Inside, among the possessions that Emily had bought for Homer, lies the decomposed corpse of Homer Barron on the bed. On the pillow beside him is the indentation of a head and a single strand of gray hair, indicating that Emily had slept with Homer's corpse. The house is an indicator revealing how Emily struggled to keep everything the same, in a frozen time period, avoiding change.

== Characters ==

'''Emily Grierson''' - The main character of the story. Emily's father kept her from seeing suitors and controlled her social life, keeping her in isolation until his death, when she is 30 years old.<ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> Her struggle with loss and attachment is the impetus for the plot, driving her to kill Homer Barron, the man that is assumed to have married her. Emily presumably poisons and kills Homer, as she sees murder as the only way to keep Homer with her permanently. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> She treats him as her living husband even after his death, which is shown by her keeping his clothes in the room, keeping his engraved wedding items on the dresser, and the strand of her hair found beside his corpse at the end of the story that indicated she even slept beside him. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> Emily's murderous act also displays her obstinate nature. This is evident in Emily's refusal to pay her taxes, her denial of her father's death, and the fact that she kills Homer to ensure that he will never leave her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> 

'''Homer Barron''' - Emily's romantic interest. He is later found dead and decomposed in Emily's bedroom after her funeral. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> He initially enters the story as a foreman for a road construction project occurring in the town. He is soon seen to be with Emily in her Sunday carriage rides, and it is expected for them to be married. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> Homer differs from the rest of the town because he is a Northerner. The story takes place in the South shortly after the Civil War, and while Homer is not necessarily unwelcome to the town, he does stand out. This, along with the fact that he is seemingly courting Emily, sets him apart from all of the other characters in the story. It is because he is an outlier that Emily becomes attracted to him. It is generally unknown if Homer reciprocates the romantic feelings Emily has for him. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> It is stated in the story, that Homer likes men and is \"not the marrying kind\"  he has commitment issues. Furthermore this brings into light Homer's homosexuality.

'''The Narrator''' - An unnamed member(s) of the town who watches the events of Emily's life unfold in its entirety. The story is presented to the reader in a non-chronological order; this suggests that the story may have been patched together by multiple tellers. Some parts of the story are repeated, such as Homer's disappearance, the idea that Emily and Homer will get married, and Emily's refusal to pay taxes, also indicating that the narrator is a voice for the town. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Getty|first=Laura|date=Summer 2005|title=Faulkner's A ROSE FOR EMILY|url=http://mrsstaceybrown.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/4/4/12441735/rose_for_emily_literary_analysis.pdf|journal=The Explicator|volume=63|pages=230–234}}</ref> Though the townspeople disapprove of most of Emily's actions, such as refusing to pay her taxes and purchasing poison, nobody intervenes.

'''Colonel Sartoris''' - The former mayor who remitted Emily's taxes. While he is in the story very little, his decision to remit Emily's taxes leads to her refusal to pay them ever again, contributing to her stubborn personality. The reason for Sartoris remitting her taxes is never given, only that he told Emily it was because her father loaned the money to the town. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref>

'''Mr. Grierson''' - Emily's father, the patriarchal head of the Grierson family. His control over Emily's personal life prohibited her from romantic involvement. The reason for his refusal to let Emily court men is not explained in the story.<ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> 
Whatever the reason, Mr. Grierson shapes the person that Emily becomes. His decision to ban all men from her life drives her to kill the first man she is attracted to and can be with, Homer Barron, in order to keep him with her permanently. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>

'''The cousins''' - Emily's extended relatives from Alabama. They come to town during Emily's courting of Homer Barron to check on Emily's well-being. They are thought of as even more uptight and stuffy than Emily by the townspeople. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> They are called in to prevent Emily and Homer from marrying; however, they are later sent back home so that the two can be wed. It is speculated that there may be some type of dispute between Emily and the cousins, indicated by them living far away from Emily and the fact that they did not attend Emily's father's funeral. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>

'''Tobe''' - Emily's cook/gardener, who is also acts as her secret keeper. Tobe is a loyal individual to Emily. During the years of Emily's isolation, he provides no details of her life to the townspeople and promptly disappears directly following her death. He became old and stooped from all of his work while Emily grew large and immobile. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> This could suggest that he resented Emily, or at the very least disliked working for her, as he does not mourn her or stay for her funeral.

== Structure ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2019}} 
{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}

Faulkner tells this story in a series of flashbacks and stretches the story out over decades. It starts with the announcement of Emily's death, an event that has the entire town talking. This leads the reader to assume that she was an important figure in the town. As Fassler says in his article “The Key,” “Clearly, this lady who died unmarried was of importance to everyone. And yet the town itself is eventually divided,”<ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/the-key-to-writing-a-mystery-is-asking-the-perfect-question/515799/</ref> and we see that division with the events depicted in between the announcement at the beginning and the revelation at the end are told out of order, making the reader analyze the story more closely than if it was told chronologically. Based on the townspeople's thoughts of Emily displayed in this section, the reader discovers that the town was not dreading Emily's death. On the other hand, it was somewhat welcomed. Emily stuck out from the rest of the town as a figure stuck in the past, desperately trying to cling to old traditions and ways of life. With her passing on, the town can finally be free of this remnant, being wholly set in the present. Had the story been told in a linear fashion, this understanding would have been lost, something Faulkner knew and incorporated into the story. By presenting the story in terms of present and past events, he could examine how they influence each other. In terms of mathematical precision, time moves on and what exists is only the present. In terms of the more subjective time, time moves on but memories can exist no matter how much time changes. Those memories stay unhindered. Through this Faulkner could analyze the depth at which Miss Emily could change as a character. If Faulkner presented the story in a linear fashion, the chances of the reader sympathizing with Emily would be far less. By telling the story out of order, the reader sees Emily as a tragic product of her environment rather than a twisted necrophiliac.

== Themes ==

{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}

\"A Rose for Emily\" discusses many dark themes that characterized the Old South and [[Southern Gothic]] fiction. 

The story explores themes of death and resistance to change. Also, it reflects the decaying of the societal tenets of the South in the 1930s. [[Emily Grierson]] had been oppressed by her father for most of her life and hadn't questioned it because that was her way of living. Likewise, the antiquated traditions of the south (often harmful, such as in the treatment of black people) had remained acceptable, as that was their way of living. Once her father had passed, Emily, in denial, refused to give his corpse up for burial—this shows her inability to functionally adapt to change. When the present mayor and aldermen insist Miss Emily pay the taxes which she had been exempted from, she refuses and continues to live in her house. Miss Emily's stubborn insistence that she \"pays no taxes in Jefferson\" and her mistaking the new mayor for Colonel Sartoris brings into question whether her acts of resistance are a conscious act of defiance or a result of a decayed mental stability. The reader is only shown Emily from an external perspective, we can not ascertain whether she acts in a rational manner or not. The death of Homer, if interpreted as having been a murder, can be seen in the context of the North-South clash. Homer, notably a northerner, is not one for the tradition of marriage. In the framework that his death was not an accident, but a murder on the part of Emily, Homer's rejection of the marriage can be seen as the North's rejection of Southern tradition. The South ends its relations with the North in retaliation. Emily continuing to sleep next to Homer's body can be seen as the south holding on to an ideal that is no longer feasible. 

Control and its repercussions is a persistent theme throughout the story. Emily's father was an intimidating and manipulative figure, keeping her from experiencing life in her own terms. She was never able to grow, learn, live her life, start a family, and marry the one she truly loved. Even after Emily's father died, his presence and impact on his daughter were still apparent. Discussing Emily and her father, the townspeople said \"We had long thought of them as a tableau, Miss Emily a slender figure in white in the background, her father a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a horsewhip, the two of them framed by the back-flung front door.\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Literature An Introduction to Fiction, Poetry, Drama, and Writing|date=2016|page=32|last1=Kennedy|first1=X.J.}}</ref> Emily is portrayed as small and powerless, placed behind the overbearing frame of her father. She wears white, a symbol of innocence and purity. Emily falls victim to the ruling hand of her father and to her place in the society: she has to uphold the [[noblesse oblige]] to which she was born into. In this way, her father's influence remains after he has passed. This control leads to Emily's isolation, both externally and internally imposed. Emily is alone, yet always being watched by the townspeople; she is both apart from and a part of the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> Her position prevents her from ever finding happiness.

The power of death is a consistent theme throughout the story. Emily herself is portrayed as a \"skeleton\" that is both \"small and spare\" which is representative of the fact that she emanates death. When it comes to death itself, Emily is in denial and most of that feeling has to do with her loneliness. After her father dies, she keeps his corpse for three days and refuses to admit that he is dead. The reader also sees this with the corpse of Homer Barron, except she is the one who inflicts death upon him. She poisons him and keeps him locked away in her room; she did not want to lose the only other person she had ever loved, so she made his stay permanent. These examples show that the power of death triumphs over everything, including \"poor Emily\", herself.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Ji-won|title=Narrator as Collective 'We':The Narrative Structure of \"A Rose for Emily\"|journal=English Language and Literature Teaching|date=2011}}</ref>

Due to this inevitability in the portrayal of death, A Rose for Emily is seen as a tale based on determinism, making the short story part of the [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism literary movement]]. Here, a character's fate is already determined no matter how much the individual struggles to change it. There are impersonal forces of nature that prevent him or her from taking control. As the very universe itself appear indifferent, this character descends into an inevitable death and decay. The case of Emily is the same. She had a mental illness, an unavoidable fate, which her father must have sought to finally end by refusing to let Emily marry, which would have continued his line. No matter what she did, there was the implication that she would ultimately go mad. There was also the depiction of a cursed land due to slavery and the class structure based upon it and that no matter how the people clung to the glorious past and soldier on, there was a tarnished way of life that leads to an impending ruin. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Strategies and Genre Conventions in Literary Studies: Teaching and Writing in the Disciplines|last=Wilder|first=Laura|publisher=SIU Press|year=2012|isbn=9780809330942|location=|pages=146}}</ref>

== Critical response ==

{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}
Floyd C. Watkins wrote about the structure of \"A Rose for Emily\" in \"[[Modern Language Notes]]\". Watkins claims that this is Faulkner's best story and that he is among the best American writers of this time period. Faulkner had to carefully dissect his sections, bringing importance to every aspect of Miss Emily's life, but Watkins sees this as a \"structural problem\" but later goes on to rave about the symmetry of this short story. Watkins enjoys this story in its entirety, and is impressed by Faulkner's ordering, as building suspense was an important aspect in the response.<ref>Watkins, Floyd C. \"Structure of \"A Rose for Emily\".\" Modern Language Notes 7th ser. 69 (1954): 508-10. JSTOR. Web. 5 Apr. 2017.</ref>

This critical response by John Skinner explores the interpretations of Faulkner's short story in detail while reviewing the importance of over-analyzing a piece of literary work. William Faulkner published this story in the 1930s, Skinner had published his critical response in 1985. More than 40 years have passed and people are still ignoring his claim; “A Rose for Emily” should not be interpreted any further. The characters and theme of this tale have been scrutinized by many. There have been numerous interpretations of what Miss Emily stands for; Skinner gives examples of scholars including S.W. M. Johnson “Emily represented a refusal to submit to, or even concede, to the inevitability of change”. Whereas, William Going pictures Emily as a rose, “the treasured memory of the Confederate veterans”. The point of view according to Skinner is of immediate relevance to the story as the chief character, the narrator tells the chronology of the story. This narrator gives approximately “round figures” for the important events of the accounts. Yet the exact chronology is of little relevance to the overall importance of the story itself. John Skinner states that Faulkner should be taken literally, appreciate his formal subtlety in his works.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Skinner|first=John|date=Winter 1985|title=\"A Rose for Emily\": Against Interpretation.\"|url=|journal=The Journal of Narrative Technique|volume=15.1|pages=42–51}}</ref>

Alice Petry introduces a different type of critical response that is not focused on the usual subjects. Rather, she focuses on the complex and provocative language. For example, Hall discusses how the sentence, \"Thus she passed from generation to generation-dear, inescapable, impervious, tranquil and perverse\" has been considered misleading, but is in fact strategically placed to provide foreshadowing and unification of plot. The five descriptive words used in the sentence each correspond to one of the five parts in the order they are seen. For example, the adjective \"inescapable\" corresponds to Part II, to the incident of the strange smell coming from Miss Emily's home. Faulkner's placement of these adjectives at the end of Part IV serves as an important unifying sentence that connects all five parts to each other.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petry|first=Alice|date=Spring 1986|title=Faulkner's A ROSE FOR EMILY|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=509417186&S=R&D=brb&EbscoContent=dGJyMNXb4kSeqLQ4v%2BbwOLCmr0%2BeprZSsam4SrKWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGvsku1p69MuePfgeyx43zx|journal=Explicator|volume=44|pages=52–54}}</ref>

Jim Barloon of the University of St. Thomas wrote about an idea introduced to him by his students, that Homer was homosexual, possibly providing another reason for his murder. He proposes that Emily did not kill Homer because of her own insecurities, but also because he did not reciprocate her romantic feelings. Thus, she could have murdered him out of affection as well as spite. Whether or not this theory is correct, it proves that the story is still being closely analyzed decades after it was written. As Barloon states in his article, “Positing that Homer Barron is gay not only raises a new set of questions but transforms [the story], or at least our perspective of it.”<ref>http://www.semo.edu/cfs/teaching/10186.html</ref>

The psychology of Emily Grierson has been analyzed countless times, with many people reaching the conclusion that she was mentally ill, and from that point, the reasons why. Though many different diagnoses have been made, the most common can be summarized as follows by Nicole Smith in her psychological analysis of the character: “It is reasonable to propose that Miss Emily developed [schizophrenia] as a response to the demanding conditions in which she was living as a Southern woman from an aristocratic family.”<ref>http://www.articlemyriad.com/psychological-character-analysis-rose-emily/{{full|date=September 2018}}</ref> This has been thought to represent just how unbearable life in the old South could be, not only for a person similar to Emily but to the people around them as well. A contributing factor to this point would change. The story is an allegory for the change that the South dealt with after the Civil War, with Emily representing the resistance of that change. This is shown in the story through Emily's conflicts with the town and her refusal of cooperation. Tuncay Tezcan in his analysis of the story states, “It represents the numerous conflicts in the main character's life, illustrating the effect of social change on the individual.”<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.12.101 |title=A Stylistic Analysis of a Rose for Emily by William Faulkner and its Turkish Translation |journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences |volume=158 |pages=364–9 |year=2014 |last1=Tezcan |first1=Tuncay }}</ref>

There has been much discussion over the title of the story. Why have a rose for Emily? At that time, giving a rose to a woman was common if they had been through a great tragedy. Emily's tragedy is her environment, changing quickly and with volatility, causing her to cling to the past in hopes of stopping the change from occurring. This has a deep impact on her mental state, driving her to extreme acts such as murdering Homer and then sleeping with his corpse for years. The town does nothing to stop these events, merely entertain the idea. Terry Heller writes in his analysis of the story that the town, “[chose] to deal with an idea of Emily, rather than with Emily herself; they are different in that they have different ideas of her and, therefore, approach her… differently.”<ref>http://www.public.coe.edu/~theller/essays/rose.html{{full|date=September 2018}}</ref> With nobody willing to help her, Emily died a broken person, and for that Faulkner gave her a rose, in sympathy of her ending.

\"'''A Rose for Emily'''\" is a [[short story]] by American author [[William Faulkner]], first published in April 30, 1930, in an issue of ''[[The Forum (defunct magazine)|The Forum]]''. The story takes place in Faulkner's fictional city Jefferson, Mississippi, in the fictional southern county of [[Yoknapatawpha]]. It was Faulkner's first short story published in a national magazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~egjbp/faulkner/r_ss_roseforemily.html|title=WFotW ~ \"A Rose for Emily\": COMMENTARY & RESOURCES|website=www.mcsr.olemiss.edu|access-date=2017-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420052408/http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~egjbp/faulkner/r_ss_roseforemily.html|archive-date=2017-04-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Title==
[[Faulkner]]&nbsp;described the title \"A Rose For Emily\" as an [[allegorical]]&nbsp;title: this woman had undergone a great tragedy, and for this Faulkner pitied her. As a salute, he handed her a rose.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DFrtepkWqWoC&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=allegorical+title%3B+the+meaning+was,+here+was+a+woman+who+had+had+a+tragedy,+an+irrevocable+tragedy+and+nothing+could+be+done+about+it|title=Introducción a la narrative breve de William Faulkner|language=es|isbn=9788481217469|author1=Outón|first1=Cristina Blanco|year=1999}}</ref> The word \"rose\" in the title has multiple meanings to it. The rose may be seen as Homer, when interpreting the rose as a dried rose. Homer's body could be the dried rose, such as one that is pressed between the pages of a book, kept in perfect condition as Emily did with Homer's body.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Getty|first=Laura|date=Summer 2005|title=Faulkner's A ROSE FOR EMILY|url=http://mrsstaceybrown.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/4/4/12441735/rose_for_emily_literary_analysis.pdf|journal=The Explicator|volume=63|pages=230–234}}</ref> The rose also represents secrecy. Roses have been portrayed in Greek legends as a gift of secrecy and of confidentiality, known as ''[[sub rosa]]'', introducing that the rose is a symbol of silence between the narrator and Miss Emily, the narrator keeps Emily's secrets until her death.

==Plot summary==
The story opens with a brief first-person account of the funeral of [[Emily Grierson]], an elderly Southern woman whose funeral is the obligation of their small town. It then proceeds in a [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linear fashion]] to the narrator's recollections of Emily's archaic and increasingly strange behavior throughout the years. Emily is a member of a family of the [[antebellum South]]ern aristocracy. After the Civil War, the family falls into hard times. She and her father, the last two of the clan, continue to live as if in the past; Emily's father refuses for her to marry.  Her father dies when Emily is about the age of 30, which takes her by surprise. She refuses to give up his corpse, and the townspeople write it off as her grieving process. The townspeople pity Emily not only after her father's death but also during his life when he wouldn't let Emily marry. Emily depended heavily on her father, believing he would never leave her; he was all she had.

After her father's death, the only person seen moving about Emily's home is Tobe, a black man serving as Emily's butler. He is frequently seen entering and exiting the house for groceries. Although Emily did not have a strong relationship with her community, she did give art lessons to young children within her town at the age of forty. A prime reason why she gave art lessons was her financial problem since she was running out of money. The townspeople make cruel comments and nasty looks behind Miss Emily's back, as she wasn't respected in her town. With the acceptance of her father's death, Emily somewhat revives, even changing the style of her hair, and becomes friendly with Homer Barron. He is a Northern laborer who comes to town shortly after Mr. Grierson's death. The connection surprises some of the community while others are glad she is taking an interest; however, \"Homer likes men and claims that he is not a marrying man.\" <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\" /> This draws attention to Homer's questionable sexuality in the story. Emily shortly buys arsenic from a druggist in town, presumably to kill rats, however, the townspeople are convinced that she will use it to poison herself. Emily's distant cousins are called into town by the minister's wife to supervise Miss Emily and Homer Barron. Homer leaves town for some time, reputedly to give Emily a chance to get rid of her cousins, and returns three days later after the cousins have left. After he is observed entering Miss Emily's home one evening, Homer is never seen alive again.

Despite these turnabouts in her social status, Emily continues to behave mysteriously, as she had before her father died. Her reputation is such that the city council finds itself unable to confront her about a strong smell that has begun to emanate from the house. They believed Tobe was unable to maintain the house and something was rotting, unaware that a death has occurred.  Instead, the council decide to send men to her house under the cover of darkness to sprinkle lime around the house, after which the smell dissipates. The mayor of the town, [[Colonel (title)|Colonel]] Sartorius, makes a [[gentleman's agreement]] to overlook her taxes as an act of charity, though it is done under a pretense of repayment towards her father, to assuage Emily's pride after her father's death. Years later, when the next generation has come to power, Emily insists on this informal arrangement, flatly refusing that she owes any taxes, stating \"I have no taxes in Jefferson.\" After this, the council declines to press the issue due to her stubbornness. Emily has become a [[recluse]]: she is never seen outside of the house, and only rarely accepts people into it. The community eventually comes to view her as a \"hereditary obligation\" on the town, who must be humored and tolerated.

The funeral is a large affair: Emily had become an institution, so her death sparks a great deal of curiosity about her reclusive nature and what remains of her house. After she is buried, a group of townsfolk enters her house to see what remains of her life there. Tobe walked out of the house and was never seen again, giving the townspeople access to Miss Emily's home. The door to her upstairs bedroom is locked, and some of the townsfolk break down the door to see what has been hidden for so long. Inside, among the possessions that Emily had bought for Homer, lies the decomposed corpse of Homer Barron on the bed. On the pillow beside him is the indentation of a head and a single strand of gray hair, indicating that Emily had slept with Homer's corpse. The house is an indicator revealing how Emily struggled to keep everything the same, in a frozen time period, avoiding change.

== Characters ==

'''Emily Grierson''' - The main character of the story. Emily's father kept her from seeing suitors and controlled her social life, keeping her in isolation until his death, when she is 30 years old.<ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> Her struggle with loss and attachment is the impetus for the plot, driving her to kill Homer Barron, the man that is assumed to have married her. Emily presumably poisons and kills Homer, as she sees murder as the only way to keep Homer with her permanently. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> She treats him as her living husband even after his death, which is shown by her keeping his clothes in the room, keeping his engraved wedding items on the dresser, and the strand of her hair found beside his corpse at the end of the story that indicated she even slept beside him. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> Emily's murderous act also displays her obstinate nature. This is evident in Emily's refusal to pay her taxes, her denial of her father's death, and the fact that she kills Homer to ensure that he will never leave her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> 

'''Homer Barron''' - Emily's romantic interest. He is later found dead and decomposed in Emily's bedroom after her funeral. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> He initially enters the story as a foreman for a road construction project occurring in the town. He is soon seen to be with Emily in her Sunday carriage rides, and it is expected for them to be married. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> Homer differs from the rest of the town because he is a Northerner. The story takes place in the South shortly after the Civil War, and while Homer is not necessarily unwelcome to the town, he does stand out. This, along with the fact that he is seemingly courting Emily, sets him apart from all of the other characters in the story. It is because he is an outlier that Emily becomes attracted to him. It is generally unknown if Homer reciprocates the romantic feelings Emily has for him. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> It is stated in the story, that Homer likes men and is \"not the marrying kind\"  he has commitment issues. Furthermore this brings into light Homer's homosexuality.

'''The Narrator''' - An unnamed member(s) of the town who watches the events of Emily's life unfold in its entirety. The story is presented to the reader in a non-chronological order; this suggests that the story may have been patched together by multiple tellers. Some parts of the story are repeated, such as Homer's disappearance, the idea that Emily and Homer will get married, and Emily's refusal to pay taxes, also indicating that the narrator is a voice for the town. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Getty|first=Laura|date=Summer 2005|title=Faulkner's A ROSE FOR EMILY|url=http://mrsstaceybrown.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/4/4/12441735/rose_for_emily_literary_analysis.pdf|journal=The Explicator|volume=63|pages=230–234}}</ref> Though the townspeople disapprove of most of Emily's actions, such as refusing to pay her taxes and purchasing poison, nobody intervenes.

'''Colonel Sartoris''' - The former mayor who remitted Emily's taxes. While he is in the story very little, his decision to remit Emily's taxes leads to her refusal to pay them ever again, contributing to her stubborn personality. The reason for Sartoris remitting her taxes is never given, only that he told Emily it was because her father loaned the money to the town. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref>

'''Mr. Grierson''' - Emily's father, the patriarchal head of the Grierson family. His control over Emily's personal life prohibited her from romantic involvement. The reason for his refusal to let Emily court men is not explained in the story.<ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> 
Whatever the reason, Mr. Grierson shapes the person that Emily becomes. His decision to ban all men from her life drives her to kill the first man she is attracted to and can be with, Homer Barron, in order to keep him with her permanently. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>

'''The cousins''' - Emily's extended relatives from Alabama. They come to town during Emily's courting of Homer Barron to check on Emily's well-being. They are thought of as even more uptight and stuffy than Emily by the townspeople. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> They are called in to prevent Emily and Homer from marrying; however, they are later sent back home so that the two can be wed. It is speculated that there may be some type of dispute between Emily and the cousins, indicated by them living far away from Emily and the fact that they did not attend Emily's father's funeral. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>

'''Tobe''' - Emily's cook/gardener, who is also acts as her secret keeper. Tobe is a loyal individual to Emily. During the years of Emily's isolation, he provides no details of her life to the townspeople and promptly disappears directly following her death. He became old and stooped from all of his work while Emily grew large and immobile. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> This could suggest that he resented Emily, or at the very least disliked working for her, as he does not mourn her or stay for her funeral.

== Structure ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2019}} 
{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}

Faulkner tells this story in a series of flashbacks and stretches the story out over decades. It starts with the announcement of Emily's death, an event that has the entire town talking. This leads the reader to assume that she was an important figure in the town. As Fassler says in his article “The Key,” “Clearly, this lady who died unmarried was of importance to everyone. And yet the town itself is eventually divided,”<ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/the-key-to-writing-a-mystery-is-asking-the-perfect-question/515799/</ref> and we see that division with the events depicted in between the announcement at the beginning and the revelation at the end are told out of order, making the reader analyze the story more closely than if it was told chronologically. Based on the townspeople's thoughts of Emily displayed in this section, the reader discovers that the town was not dreading Emily's death. On the other hand, it was somewhat welcomed. Emily stuck out from the rest of the town as a figure stuck in the past, desperately trying to cling to old traditions and ways of life. With her passing on, the town can finally be free of this remnant, being wholly set in the present. Had the story been told in a linear fashion, this understanding would have been lost, something Faulkner knew and incorporated into the story. By presenting the story in terms of present and past events, he could examine how they influence each other. In terms of mathematical precision, time moves on and what exists is only the present. In terms of the more subjective time, time moves on but memories can exist no matter how much time changes. Those memories stay unhindered. Through this Faulkner could analyze the depth at which Miss Emily could change as a character. If Faulkner presented the story in a linear fashion, the chances of the reader sympathizing with Emily would be far less. By telling the story out of order, the reader sees Emily as a tragic product of her environment rather than a twisted necrophiliac.

== Themes ==

{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}

\"A Rose for Emily\" discusses many dark themes that characterized the Old South and [[Southern Gothic]] fiction. 

The story explores themes of death and resistance to change. Also, it reflects the decaying of the societal tenets of the South in the 1930s. [[Emily Grierson]] had been oppressed by her father for most of her life and hadn't questioned it because that was her way of living. Likewise, the antiquated traditions of the south (often harmful, such as in the treatment of black people) had remained acceptable, as that was their way of living. Once her father had passed, Emily, in denial, refused to give his corpse up for burial—this shows her inability to functionally adapt to change. When the present mayor and aldermen insist Miss Emily pay the taxes which she had been exempted from, she refuses and continues to live in her house. Miss Emily's stubborn insistence that she \"pays no taxes in Jefferson\" and her mistaking the new mayor for Colonel Sartoris brings into question whether her acts of resistance are a conscious act of defiance or a result of a decayed mental stability. The reader is only shown Emily from an external perspective, we can not ascertain whether she acts in a rational manner or not. The death of Homer, if interpreted as having been a murder, can be seen in the context of the North-South clash. Homer, notably a northerner, is not one for the tradition of marriage. In the framework that his death was not an accident, but a murder on the part of Emily, Homer's rejection of the marriage can be seen as the North's rejection of Southern tradition. The South ends its relations with the North in retaliation. Emily continuing to sleep next to Homer's body can be seen as the south holding on to an ideal that is no longer feasible. 

Control and its repercussions is a persistent theme throughout the story. Emily's father was an intimidating and manipulative figure, keeping her from experiencing life in her own terms. She was never able to grow, learn, live her life, start a family, and marry the one she truly loved. Even after Emily's father died, his presence and impact on his daughter were still apparent. Discussing Emily and her father, the townspeople said \"We had long thought of them as a tableau, Miss Emily a slender figure in white in the background, her father a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a horsewhip, the two of them framed by the back-flung front door.\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Literature An Introduction to Fiction, Poetry, Drama, and Writing|date=2016|page=32|last1=Kennedy|first1=X.J.}}</ref> Emily is portrayed as small and powerless, placed behind the overbearing frame of her father. She wears white, a symbol of innocence and purity. Emily falls victim to the ruling hand of her father and to her place in the society: she has to uphold the [[noblesse oblige]] to which she was born into. In this way, her father's influence remains after he has passed. This control leads to Emily's isolation, both externally and internally imposed. Emily is alone, yet always being watched by the townspeople; she is both apart from and a part of the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> Her position prevents her from ever finding happiness.

The power of death is a consistent theme throughout the story. Emily herself is portrayed as a \"skeleton\" that is both \"small and spare\" which is representative of the fact that she emanates death. When it comes to death itself, Emily is in denial and most of that feeling has to do with her loneliness. After her father dies, she keeps his corpse for three days and refuses to admit that he is dead. The reader also sees this with the corpse of Homer Barron, except she is the one who inflicts death upon him. She poisons him and keeps him locked away in her room; she did not want to lose the only other person she had ever loved, so she made his stay permanent. These examples show that the power of death triumphs over everything, including \"poor Emily\", herself.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Ji-won|title=Narrator as Collective 'We':The Narrative Structure of \"A Rose for Emily\"|journal=English Language and Literature Teaching|date=2011}}</ref>

Due to this inevitability in the portrayal of death, A Rose for Emily is seen as a tale based on determinism, making the short story part of the [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism literary movement]]. Here, a character's fate is already determined no matter how much the individual struggles to change it. There are impersonal forces of nature that prevent him or her from taking control. As the very universe itself appear indifferent, this character descends into an inevitable death and decay. The case of Emily is the same. She had a mental illness, an unavoidable fate, which her father must have sought to finally end by refusing to let Emily marry, which would have continued his line. No matter what she did, there was the implication that she would ultimately go mad. There was also the depiction of a cursed land due to slavery and the class structure based upon it and that no matter how the people clung to the glorious past and soldier on, there was a tarnished way of life that leads to an impending ruin. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Strategies and Genre Conventions in Literary Studies: Teaching and Writing in the Disciplines|last=Wilder|first=Laura|publisher=SIU Press|year=2012|isbn=9780809330942|location=|pages=146}}</ref>

== Critical response ==

{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}
Floyd C. Watkins wrote about the structure of \"A Rose for Emily\" in \"[[Modern Language Notes]]\". Watkins claims that this is Faulkner's best story and that he is among the best American writers of this time period. Faulkner had to carefully dissect his sections, bringing importance to every aspect of Miss Emily's life, but Watkins sees this as a \"structural problem\" but later goes on to rave about the symmetry of this short story. Watkins enjoys this story in its entirety, and is impressed by Faulkner's ordering, as building suspense was an important aspect in the response.<ref>Watkins, Floyd C. \"Structure of \"A Rose for Emily\".\" Modern Language Notes 7th ser. 69 (1954): 508-10. JSTOR. Web. 5 Apr. 2017.</ref>

This critical response by John Skinner explores the interpretations of Faulkner's short story in detail while reviewing the importance of over-analyzing a piece of literary work. William Faulkner published this story in the 1930s, Skinner had published his critical response in 1985. More than 40 years have passed and people are still ignoring his claim; “A Rose for Emily” should not be interpreted any further. The characters and theme of this tale have been scrutinized by many. There have been numerous interpretations of what Miss Emily stands for; Skinner gives examples of scholars including S.W. M. Johnson “Emily represented a refusal to submit to, or even concede, to the inevitability of change”. Whereas, William Going pictures Emily as a rose, “the treasured memory of the Confederate veterans”. The point of view according to Skinner is of immediate relevance to the story as the chief character, the narrator tells the chronology of the story. This narrator gives approximately “round figures” for the important events of the accounts. Yet the exact chronology is of little relevance to the overall importance of the story itself. John Skinner states that Faulkner should be taken literally, appreciate his formal subtlety in his works.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Skinner|first=John|date=Winter 1985|title=\"A Rose for Emily\": Against Interpretation.\"|url=|journal=The Journal of Narrative Technique|volume=15.1|pages=42–51}}</ref>

Alice Petry introduces a different type of critical response that is not focused on the usual subjects. Rather, she focuses on the complex and provocative language. For example, Hall discusses how the sentence, \"Thus she passed from generation to generation-dear, inescapable, impervious, tranquil and perverse\" has been considered misleading, but is in fact strategically placed to provide foreshadowing and unification of plot. The five descriptive words used in the sentence each correspond to one of the five parts in the order they are seen. For example, the adjective \"inescapable\" corresponds to Part II, to the incident of the strange smell coming from Miss Emily's home. Faulkner's placement of these adjectives at the end of Part IV serves as an important unifying sentence that connects all five parts to each other.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petry|first=Alice|date=Spring 1986|title=Faulkner's A ROSE FOR EMILY|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=509417186&S=R&D=brb&EbscoContent=dGJyMNXb4kSeqLQ4v%2BbwOLCmr0%2BeprZSsam4SrKWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGvsku1p69MuePfgeyx43zx|journal=Explicator|volume=44|pages=52–54}}</ref>

Jim Barloon of the University of St. Thomas wrote about an idea introduced to him by his students, that Homer was homosexual, possibly providing another reason for his murder. He proposes that Emily did not kill Homer because of her own insecurities, but also because he did not reciprocate her romantic feelings. Thus, she could have murdered him out of affection as well as spite. Whether or not this theory is correct, it proves that the story is still being closely analyzed decades after it was written. As Barloon states in his article, “Positing that Homer Barron is gay not only raises a new set of questions but transforms [the story], or at least our perspective of it.”<ref>http://www.semo.edu/cfs/teaching/10186.html</ref>

The psychology of Emily Grierson has been analyzed countless times, with many people reaching the conclusion that she was mentally ill, and from that point, the reasons why. Though many different diagnoses have been made, the most common can be summarized as follows by Nicole Smith in her psychological analysis of the character: “It is reasonable to propose that Miss Emily developed [schizophrenia] as a response to the demanding conditions in which she was living as a Southern woman from an aristocratic family.”<ref>http://www.articlemyriad.com/psychological-character-analysis-rose-emily/{{full|date=September 2018}}</ref> This has been thought to represent just how unbearable life in the old South could be, not only for a person similar to Emily but to the people around them as well. A contributing factor to this point would change. The story is an allegory for the change that the South dealt with after the Civil War, with Emily representing the resistance of that change. This is shown in the story through Emily's conflicts with the town and her refusal of cooperation. Tuncay Tezcan in his analysis of the story states, “It represents the numerous conflicts in the main character's life, illustrating the effect of social change on the individual.”<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.12.101 |title=A Stylistic Analysis of a Rose for Emily by William Faulkner and its Turkish Translation |journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences |volume=158 |pages=364–9 |year=2014 |last1=Tezcan |first1=Tuncay }}</ref>

There has been much discussion over the title of the story. Why have a rose for Emily? At that time, giving a rose to a woman was common if they had been through a great tragedy. Emily's tragedy is her environment, changing quickly and with volatility, causing her to cling to the past in hopes of stopping the change from occurring. This has a deep impact on her mental state, driving her to extreme acts such as murdering Homer and then sleeping with his corpse for years. The town does nothing to stop these events, merely entertain the idea. Terry Heller writes in his analysis of the story that the town, “[chose] to deal with an idea of Emily, rather than with Emily herself; they are different in that they have different ideas of her and, therefore, approach her… differently.”<ref>http://www.public.coe.edu/~theller/essays/rose.html{{full|date=September 2018}}</ref> With nobody willing to help her, Emily died a broken person, and for that Faulkner gave her a rose, in sympathy of her ending.

==History==

=== Beginnings ===
The band met and was formed through a series of open mic nights at Seattle's Conor Byrne pub in [[Ballard, Seattle|Ballard]].<ref name=SS>{{cite web|last1=Messer|first1=Kaylyn|title=Interview: The Head and The Heart|url=http://seattlescenester.com/music/interview-the-head-and-the-heart/|website=Seattle Scenester|accessdate=4 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423214613/http://seattlescenester.com/music/interview-the-head-and-the-heart/|archivedate=23 April 2011|date=11 May 2010}}</ref> Josiah Johnson had moved to Seattle from Southern California to pursue graduate school, and Jonathan Russell was a recent transfer from [[Richmond, Virginia]]. They met keyboardist Kenny Hensley, who had also moved to Seattle to pursue musical score-writing, and Charity Rose Thielen, who had recently returned from a year studying abroad in Paris at the [[Sciences Po]]. Drummer Tyler Williams had been in the band [[Prabir and The Substitutes]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], but then moved to Seattle to be a part of the nascent Head and The Heart, after hearing one demo that Russell sent to him for the song \"Down In The Valley\". Chris Zasche was bartending at the Conor Byrne, working aftercare shifts at The Perkins School, and playing in Seattle bands [[The Maldives (band)|The Maldives]] and [[Grand Hallway]], and was the last to be added to original lineup. Johnson explained how the name of the band was chosen: \"Your head is telling you to be stable and find a good job, you know in your heart that this [the band] is what you're supposed to do even if it's crazy.\"<ref name=\"MJ\">{{cite news|last1=Caldwell|first1=Maggie|title=Such a Nice Band: The Head and the Heart|url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/10/head-and-the-heart-lets-be-still-interview|accessdate=4 February 2016|work=Mother Jones|date=7 October 2013}}</ref>

==History==

=== Beginnings ===
The band met and was formed through a series of open mic nights at Seattle's Conor Byrne pub in [[Ballard, Seattle|Ballard]].<ref name=SS>{{cite web|last1=Messer|first1=Kaylyn|title=Interview: The Head and The Heart|url=http://seattlescenester.com/music/interview-the-head-and-the-heart/|website=Seattle Scenester|accessdate=4 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423214613/http://seattlescenester.com/music/interview-the-head-and-the-heart/|archivedate=23 April 2011|date=11 May 2010}}</ref> Josiah Johnson had moved to Seattle from Southern California to pursue graduate school, and Jonathan Russell was a recent transfer from [[Richmond, Virginia]]. They met keyboardist Kenny Hensley, who had also moved to Seattle to pursue musical score-writing, and Charity Rose Thielen, who had recently returned from a year studying abroad in Paris at the [[Sciences Po]]. Drummer Tyler Williams had been in the band [[Prabir and The Substitutes]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], but then moved to Seattle to be a part of the nascent Head and The Heart, after hearing one demo that Russell sent to him for the song \"Down In The Valley\". Chris Zasche was bartending at the Conor Byrne, working aftercare shifts at The Perkins School, and playing in Seattle bands [[The Maldives (band)|The Maldives]] and [[Grand Hallway]], and was the last to be added to original lineup. Johnson explained how the name of the band was chosen: \"Your head is telling you to be stable and find a good job, you know in your heart that this [the band] is what you're supposed to do even if it's crazy.\"<ref name=\"MJ\">{{cite news|last1=Caldwell|first1=Maggie|title=Such a Nice Band: The Head and the Heart|url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/10/head-and-the-heart-lets-be-still-interview|accessdate=4 February 2016|work=Mother Jones|date=7 October 2013}}</ref>

==Controversy==
===2006===
In 2006, one of the runner ups of Miss Pakistan World was sent to China to represent Pakistan in Miss Bikini of the Universe. That caused a stir<ref>https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/pakistan/row-over-bikini-contestant-rages-1.255267</ref> in Pakistan.<ref>https://www.theasiantoday.com/index.php/2006/12/06/crowning-glory-for-miss-pakistan-beauty-pageants/</ref> However, Pakistan got its title of Best in Media<ref>https://www.houstonpress.com/news/bikini-revolution-6544639</ref> in the year 2006.<ref>http://old.paktribune.com/news/Pakistans-first-Miss-Bikini!-153100.html/?page=3</ref> The president of Miss Pakistan World, [[Sonia Ahmed]]<ref>https://www.financialexpress.com/archive/expat-pakistani-beauties-launch-bikini-rebellion/186675/</ref> defended the pageant and the titleholder<ref>https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-a-rewarding-2006-for-pak-beauties-1065796</ref> and said that the contest will continue no matter what happened. 

===2008-2009===
The pageant has been criticised by Pakistani [[feminist]] [[Amna Buttar]] of the Asian-American Network Against Abuse of Human Rights, who wrote in an email to the ''[[New York Times]]'': <blockquote>\"In Pakistan, we are trying to get basic rights for women: right to marry, right to divorce, equal opportunity for job and education, and issues like Miss Pakistan create problems for this movement. An average Pakistani young woman does not want to wear a [[bikini]]<ref>https://gulfnews.com/news/asia/pakistan/row-over-bikini-contestant-rages-1.255267</ref> in public, and for her it is important to have equal opportunity and all focus should be on that, and not on a pageant where only the elite can participate.\"<ref name=\"NYT\"/></blockquote> [[Sonia Ahmed]] President of Miss Pakistan World defended<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.southasianpost.com/article/4747-beauty-aims-fight-beasts-pakistan.html|title=Beauty aims to fight the beasts of Pakistan {{!}} South Asian Post {{!}} Indo Canadian newspaper - Vancouver, Surrey, Calgary, Toronto, Brampton, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Montreal|website=www.southasianpost.com|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> the event as a movement to express one's rights and freedom to do as one wishes.

In 2008, Miss Pakistan World landed in yet another controversy<ref>http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/apr/16look.htm</ref> and that was pertaining to the President of Pakistan<ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/I-want-to-date-Mush-the-hunk/articleshow/2957969.cms</ref>, [[Pervez Musharraf]].<ref>https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-i-fell-in-love-with-musharraf-miss-pakistan-world-1160695</ref> The current Miss Pakistan World<ref>https://www.news18.com/news/india/musharraf-is-a-hunk-says-miss-pakistan-world-287413.html</ref> had expressed her desire<ref>http://www.sify.com/news/i-fell-in-love-with-musharraf-miss-pakistan-world-news-international-jegq0xbjjdgsi.html</ref> to date the President and confessed that she was in love<ref>https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/news/world/miss-pakistan-thinks-musharraf-is-a-hunk/articleshow/15802953.cms</ref> with the President.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/nyregion/19bigcity.html</ref>

In December 2008, the reigning Miss Pakistan World, Natasha Paracha<ref>https://www.dawn.com/news/335008/</ref> used the word \"condone<ref>https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/oops-pak-beauty-condones-blasts/cid/515859</ref>\" instead of condemn<ref>https://southasia.typepad.com/south_asia_daily/2008/12/miss-pakistan-condones-mumbai-attacks-while-condemning-them-.html</ref> for the terrorist attacks on Mumbai. This caused the Indian community around the world to react.<ref>https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-miss-pakistan-minces-her-words-condones-2611-1215341</ref>

===2010===
In 2010 the pageant also fell into some controversy when it was held in the month of [[Ramadan]] as well as when the floods affected Pakistan 3 weeks prior to the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/today/node/11438|title=Beauty Pageant Rookie Wins Crown - BU Today - Boston University|publisher=|access-date=16 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904033347/http://www.bu.edu/today/node/11438|archive-date=4 September 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Toronto Star\">[[Toronto Star]], [https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/850312--pakistani-beauty-pageant-to-go-ahead The flood in Pakistan will not stop the pageant in Toronto], Published On Thu 19 August 2010</ref><ref name=\"Globe and Mail\">Globe and Mail, ''[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/organizers-criticized-for-running-pakistani-pageant-in-wake-of-flood-disaster/article1679280/]'', Published on Thursday, 19 August 2010 10:30PM EDT</ref><ref name=\"The Guardian\">Alia Waheed, [[The Guardian]], \"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/19/pakistan-anger-beauty-contest-floods Miss Pakistan World pageant's timing causes dismay: Demands for Toronto beauty contest to be called off in light of humanitarian crisis brought by flooding in Pakistan]\", Thursday 19 August 2010 18.16 BST</ref>

===2013-2019===

According to the police<ref>https://www.brecorder.com/2019/12/04/550282/former-miss-pakistan-world-zanib-naveed-dies-in-car-crash/</ref>, she attempted to take a curve to Route 1 and her vehicle struck a curb and flipped over. She<ref>https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/04-Dec-2019/former-miss-pakistan-dies-in-car-crash-in-usa</ref> was ejected from the vehicle and died at the scene. Alcohol did not appear to be a factor in the crash, according to a preliminary investigation. Naveed<ref>https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/briarcliff/news/32-year-old-area-woman-killed-in-crash-was-miss-pakistan-world/780057/</ref> was the only person<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/new-york-woman-killed-in-crash-along-icc-in-college-park-area/2019/12/02/1103c724-1518-11ea-8406-df3c54b3253e_story.html</ref> in the car.

On December 5th, 2019, [[Sonia Ahmed]]<ref>http://www.itssouthasian.com/former-miss-pakistan-world-zanib-naveed-dies-in-a-car-crash/</ref> President of Miss Pakistan World was interviewed by [[People (magazine)]]<ref>https://people.com/human-interest/former-miss-pakistan-world-zanib-naveed-dies-car-crash/</ref> Los Angeles USA for the untimely death of one of the winners of Miss Pakistan World [[Zanib Naveed]]. Ahmed answered, “As the President of Miss Pakistan World, we gave Naveed an amazing platform to represent Pakistan internationally and hearing about her death is very upsetting to all of us,” Ahmed said. “Being a beauty queen to a country like Pakistan where there have been no beauty pageants on the soil of Pakistan is a tough job!” “Naveed along with other winners of Miss Pakistan World had a huge responsibility of carrying the title of a Muslim Nation,” she continued. “It is a very upsetting time and terrible news and we can all hope and pray that her family gets through this painful situation.”
===2020===
On 12 April 2020, Ravish Zahid Thomas<ref name=\":42\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewallet.com.pk/thepage/mrs-pakistan-world-2020m-ravish-zahid-thomas/|title=Meet Mrs Pakistan World 2020, Ravish Zahid Thomas|last=Mahmud Kasuri|first=Fraaz|date=2020-04-11|website=The Wallet|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> won the title of Miss Pakistan World 2020. She is 26 years old, lived in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], and married with Drew Thomas.

==Expansion==

In 2007 Mrs. Pakistan World,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/pakistan-gets-mrs-pakistan-world-221800650.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130412051958/http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/pakistan-gets-mrs-pakistan-world-221800650.html |archivedate=2013-04-12 }}</ref> for married women, was created as a spin-off. Both the Miss Pakistan World and the Mrs. Pakistan World pageant were created on the basis of issues faced by [[women in Pakistan]].The pageant is running successfully since 2007.

In 2011 Mr. Pakistan World, for single males of Pakistani descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbiedressupgames.site/|title=Meet the new Mr. Pakistan World|website=pageantcenter.com}}</ref> The pageant has been running since 2011 and has been incorporated with the Miss Pakistan World pageant on stage.

In 2016, [[Sonia Ahmed]] got successful sending the first delegate directly from [[Pakistan]] to represent Pakistan in international pageants. Diya Ali<ref>https://tribune.com.pk/story/1648074/4-lahore-based-diya-ali-participate-miss-eco-international-2018/</ref> was the first representative from Pakistan<ref>https://images.dawn.com/news/1176877</ref> in 2016, and won the Miss Perpetual<ref>http://tribune.com.pk/story/1281667/pakistani-model-aiming-miss-world-title/</ref> title in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] at the [[Miss Asia Pacific International]] pageant. That created a base for sending contestants directly from Pakistan for Miss Pakistan, Mrs. Pakistan and Mr. Pakistan, all new contests for Pakistan only.

==Controversy==
===2006===
In 2006, one of the runner ups of Miss Pakistan World was sent to China to represent Pakistan in Miss Bikini of the Universe. That caused a stir<ref>https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/pakistan/row-over-bikini-contestant-rages-1.255267</ref> in Pakistan.<ref>https://www.theasiantoday.com/index.php/2006/12/06/crowning-glory-for-miss-pakistan-beauty-pageants/</ref> However, Pakistan got its title of Best in Media<ref>https://www.houstonpress.com/news/bikini-revolution-6544639</ref> in the year 2006.<ref>http://old.paktribune.com/news/Pakistans-first-Miss-Bikini!-153100.html/?page=3</ref> The president of Miss Pakistan World, [[Sonia Ahmed]]<ref>https://www.financialexpress.com/archive/expat-pakistani-beauties-launch-bikini-rebellion/186675/</ref> defended the pageant and the titleholder<ref>https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-a-rewarding-2006-for-pak-beauties-1065796</ref> and said that the contest will continue no matter what happened. 

===2008-2009===
The pageant has been criticised by Pakistani [[feminist]] [[Amna Buttar]] of the Asian-American Network Against Abuse of Human Rights, who wrote in an email to the ''[[New York Times]]'': <blockquote>\"In Pakistan, we are trying to get basic rights for women: right to marry, right to divorce, equal opportunity for job and education, and issues like Miss Pakistan create problems for this movement. An average Pakistani young woman does not want to wear a [[bikini]]<ref>https://gulfnews.com/news/asia/pakistan/row-over-bikini-contestant-rages-1.255267</ref> in public, and for her it is important to have equal opportunity and all focus should be on that, and not on a pageant where only the elite can participate.\"<ref name=\"NYT\"/></blockquote> [[Sonia Ahmed]] President of Miss Pakistan World defended<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.southasianpost.com/article/4747-beauty-aims-fight-beasts-pakistan.html|title=Beauty aims to fight the beasts of Pakistan {{!}} South Asian Post {{!}} Indo Canadian newspaper - Vancouver, Surrey, Calgary, Toronto, Brampton, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Montreal|website=www.southasianpost.com|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> the event as a movement to express one's rights and freedom to do as one wishes.

In 2008, Miss Pakistan World landed in yet another controversy<ref>http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/apr/16look.htm</ref> and that was pertaining to the President of Pakistan<ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/I-want-to-date-Mush-the-hunk/articleshow/2957969.cms</ref>, [[Pervez Musharraf]].<ref>https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-i-fell-in-love-with-musharraf-miss-pakistan-world-1160695</ref> The current Miss Pakistan World<ref>https://www.news18.com/news/india/musharraf-is-a-hunk-says-miss-pakistan-world-287413.html</ref> had expressed her desire<ref>http://www.sify.com/news/i-fell-in-love-with-musharraf-miss-pakistan-world-news-international-jegq0xbjjdgsi.html</ref> to date the President and confessed that she was in love<ref>https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/news/world/miss-pakistan-thinks-musharraf-is-a-hunk/articleshow/15802953.cms</ref> with the President.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/nyregion/19bigcity.html</ref>

In December 2008, the reigning Miss Pakistan World, Natasha Paracha<ref>https://www.dawn.com/news/335008/</ref> used the word \"condone<ref>https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/oops-pak-beauty-condones-blasts/cid/515859</ref>\" instead of condemn<ref>https://southasia.typepad.com/south_asia_daily/2008/12/miss-pakistan-condones-mumbai-attacks-while-condemning-them-.html</ref> for the terrorist attacks on Mumbai. This caused the Indian community around the world to react.<ref>https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-miss-pakistan-minces-her-words-condones-2611-1215341</ref>

According to the police<ref>https://www.brecorder.com/2019/12/04/550282/former-miss-pakistan-world-zanib-naveed-dies-in-car-crash/</ref>, she attempted to take a curve to Route 1 and her vehicle struck a curb and flipped over. She<ref>https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/04-Dec-2019/former-miss-pakistan-dies-in-car-crash-in-usa</ref> was ejected from the vehicle and died at the scene. Alcohol did not appear to be a factor in the crash, according to a preliminary investigation.

On December 5th, 2019, [[Sonia Ahmed]]<ref>http://www.itssouthasian.com/former-miss-pakistan-world-zanib-naveed-dies-in-a-car-crash/</ref> President of Miss Pakistan World was interviewed by [[People (magazine)]]<ref>https://people.com/human-interest/former-miss-pakistan-world-zanib-naveed-dies-car-crash/</ref> Los Angeles USA for the untimely death of one of the winners of Miss Pakistan World [[Zanib Naveed]]. Ahmed answered, “As the President of Miss Pakistan World, we gave Naveed an amazing platform to represent Pakistan internationally and hearing about her death is very upsetting to all of us,” Ahmed said. “Being a beauty queen to a country like Pakistan where there have been no beauty pageants on the soil of Pakistan is a tough job!” “Naveed along with other winners of Miss Pakistan World had a huge responsibility of carrying the title of a Muslim Nation,” she continued. “It is a very upsetting time and terrible news and we can all hope and pray that her family gets through this painful situation.”

==Expansion==

In 2007 Mrs. Pakistan World,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/pakistan-gets-mrs-pakistan-world-221800650.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130412051958/http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/pakistan-gets-mrs-pakistan-world-221800650.html |archivedate=2013-04-12 }}</ref> for married women, was created as a spin-off. Both the Miss Pakistan World and the Mrs. Pakistan World pageant were created on the basis of issues faced by [[women in Pakistan]].The pageant is running successfully since 2007.

In 2011 Mr. Pakistan World, for single males of Pakistani descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbiedressupgames.site/|title=Meet the new Mr. Pakistan World|website=pageantcenter.com}}</ref> The pageant has been running since 2011 and has been incorporated with the Miss Pakistan World pageant on stage.

In 2016, [[Sonia Ahmed]] got successful sending the first delegate directly from [[Pakistan]] to represent Pakistan in international pageants. Diya Ali<ref>https://tribune.com.pk/story/1648074/4-lahore-based-diya-ali-participate-miss-eco-international-2018/</ref> was the first representative from Pakistan<ref>https://images.dawn.com/news/1176877</ref> in 2016, and won the Miss Perpetual<ref>http://tribune.com.pk/story/1281667/pakistani-model-aiming-miss-world-title/</ref> title in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] at the [[Miss Asia Pacific International]] pageant. That created a base for sending contestants directly from Pakistan for Miss Pakistan, Mrs. Pakistan and Mr. Pakistan, all new contests for Pakistan only.

=== New elections ===
Netanyahu was unable to form a coalition by the deadline of 29 May. Instead of letting [[Benny Gantz]] attempt to form a coalition of his own, the majority of the Knesset dissolved itself and a snap election was held on 17 September 2019.<ref name=guardian/> 

The second election was inconclusive, prompting warnings of a third election.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/elections/.premium-real-voter-fraud-will-be-a-third-israel-election-we-shouldn-t-let-this-happen-1.7857567|title=Real voter fraud will be a third Israel election. We shouldn’t let it happen|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=18 September 2019|accessdate=19 September 2019|author=Noa Landau}}</ref>

The threat was deemed unacceptable by the opposition and the general public, and the prime minister called on Gantz to form a [[national unity government]], even offering to cede the top job sometime in the future. Gantz rejected this offer<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/netanyahu-calls-for-unity-government-after-election-deadlock-11568881009|title=Gantz Declares Win, Rejects Netanyahu’s Call for Negotiations|author1=Felicia Schwartz|author2=Dov Lieber|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=19 September 2019|accessdate=19 September 2019}}</ref> , noting Netanyahu's proposed unity government would include all of Netanyahu's right-wing allies but none of Gantz's centre-left allies. Gantz has also refused to sit with Likud so long as Netanyahu is its leader, due to the [[Investigations involving Benjamin Netanyahu|criminal cases against Netanyahu]].{{cn|date=September 2019}}

[[Yisrael Beitenu]] and its leader, [[Avigdor Lieberman]], have called for a secular unity government composed of themselves, Likud, and Blue and White, and that would specifically exclude Netanyahu's right-wing and religious allies. As Lieberman's party holds the [[kingmaker|balance of power]] in the Knesset, analysts have identified such a coalition as the most viable option.{{cn|date=September 2019}}

Netanyahu agreed to this stipulation and called for a \"unity government\" between himself, his allied religious parties, and Gantz. Gantz refused on the basis that he had promised during the election not to join a Netanyahu-led coalition, and furthermore a coalition that included all of Netanyahu's allies would not truly be a unity government.

On 27 March 2020, it was revealed that a major obstacle to a possible long-term alliance between Gantz and Netanyahu emerged with regards to implementing U.S. President [[Trump peace plan|Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan]]. Barak Ravid of Israel's Channel 13 news revealed that despite Gantz's previous claim that he wanted to implement the peace plan, Gantz still wanted to hold peace talks with the Palestinians, which Trump and Netanyahu still opposed. Ravid stated that this would likely make the upcoming deal between Gantz and Netanyahu short-lived. As part of the proposed coalition deal between Netanyahu and Gantz, Gantz would replace Netanyahu as Prime Minister of Israel in 18 months.<ref name=\"gantzcrack\">{{cite web|url=https://www.axios.com/trump-peace-plan-annexation-gantz-netanyahu-02d228a7-b5a9-49e7-ac15-e8676a193ce7.html|title=Trump peace plan a sticking point in Israel's Netanyahu-Gantz pact|author=Barak Ravid|date=27 March 2020|work=[[Axios (website)|Axios]]|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> Gantz' term as prime minister-designate will end on 14 April.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-faces-a-rebellion-on-the-right-as-new-government-takes-shape/|title=Netanyahu faces a rebellion on the right as new government takes shape|author=Haviv Retig Gur|date=1 April 2020|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>

The second election was inconclusive, prompting warnings of a third election.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/elections/.premium-real-voter-fraud-will-be-a-third-israel-election-we-shouldn-t-let-this-happen-1.7857567|title=Real voter fraud will be a third Israel election. We shouldn’t let it happen|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=18 September 2019|accessdate=19 September 2019|author=Noa Landau}}</ref>

The threat was deemed unacceptable by the opposition and the general public, and the prime minister called on Gantz to form a [[national unity government]], even offering to cede the top job sometime in the future. Gantz rejected this offer<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/netanyahu-calls-for-unity-government-after-election-deadlock-11568881009|title=Gantz Declares Win, Rejects Netanyahu’s Call for Negotiations|author1=Felicia Schwartz|author2=Dov Lieber|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=19 September 2019|accessdate=19 September 2019}}</ref> , noting Netanyahu's proposed unity government would include all of Netanyahu's right-wing allies but none of Gantz's centre-left allies. Gantz has also refused to sit with Likud so long as Netanyahu is its leader, due to the [[Investigations involving Benjamin Netanyahu|criminal cases against Netanyahu]].{{cn|date=September 2019}}

[[Yisrael Beitenu]] and its leader, [[Avigdor Lieberman]], have called for a secular unity government composed of themselves, Likud, and Blue and White, and that would specifically exclude Netanyahu's right-wing and religious allies. As Lieberman's party holds the [[kingmaker|balance of power]] in the Knesset, analysts have identified such a coalition as the most viable option.{{cn|date=September 2019}}

Rivlin officially chose Netanyahu to form the next government on 25 September,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/politics/1569423363-israeli-president-to-name-candidate-to-form-government-within-hours|title=Israel elections: President Rivlin to tap incumbent Netanyahu to form govt|date=25 September 2019|work=[[i24 News]]|access-date=25 September 2019|language=en}}</ref> though he conditioned it on Netanyahu giving back the mandate if he failed to form a government, in order to avoid another dissolution of the Knesset.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/back-to-square-one-new-elections-loom-after-rivlins-unity-bid-falls-short/|title=Back to square one: New elections loom after Rivlin’s unity bid falls short|date=25 September 2019|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|access-date=25 September 2019|language=en|author=Raoul Wootliff}}</ref>

Netanyahu agreed to this stipulation and called for a \"unity government\" between himself, his allied religious parties, and Gantz. Gantz refused on the basis that he had promised during the election not to join a Netanyahu-led coalition, and furthermore a coalition that included all of Netanyahu's allies would not truly be a unity government.

On 27 March 2020, it was revealed that a major obstacle to a possible long-term alliance between Gantz and Netanyahu emerged with regards to implementing U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan. Barak Ravid of Israel's Channel 13 news revealed that despite Gantz's previous claim that he wanted to implement the peace plan, Gantz still wanted to hold peace talks with the Palestinians, which Trump and Netanyahu still opposed. Ravid stated that this would likely make the upcoming deal between Gantz and Netanyahu short-lived. As part of the proposed coalition deal between Netanyahu and Gantz, Gantz would replace Netanyahu as Prime Minister of Israel in 18 months.<ref name=\"gantzcrack\">{{cite web|url=https://www.axios.com/trump-peace-plan-annexation-gantz-netanyahu-02d228a7-b5a9-49e7-ac15-e8676a193ce7.html|title=Trump peace plan a sticking point in Israel's Netanyahu-Gantz pact|author=Barak Ravid|date=27 March 2020|work=[[Axios (website)|Axios]]|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> Gantz' term as prime minister-designate will end on 14 April.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-faces-a-rebellion-on-the-right-as-new-government-takes-shape/|title=Netanyahu faces a rebellion on the right as new government takes shape|author=Haviv Retig Gur|date=1 April 2020|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>

The '''Massillon Tigers''' were an early professional [[American football|football]] team from [[Massillon, Ohio]]. Playing in the \"[[Ohio League]]\", the team was a rival to the pre-[[National Football League]] version of the [[Canton Bulldogs]]. The Tigers won Ohio League championships in 1903, 1904, 1905, and 1906, then merged to become \"All-Massillons\" to win another title in 1907. The team returned as the Tigers in 1915 but, with the reemergence of the Bulldogs, only won one more Ohio League title. Pro football was popularized in Ohio when the amateur Massillon Tigers, hired four Pittsburgh pros to play in the season-ending game against Akron. At the same time, pro football declined in the [[Pittsburgh]] area, and the emphasis on the pro game moved west from [[Pennsylvania]] to Ohio.

The team opted not to join the APFA (later renamed the NFL) in 1920; it remained an independent club through 1923, when the Tigers folded. During their time as an independent, the Tigers never played against any team in the NFL, even though several other independent teams did. The Massillon Tigers team name was transferred to [[Massillon Washington High School]], which still uses it today.

==History==

===Origins===
The Massillon area had fielded several amateur football teams featuring only local players since the early 1890s. However while some had performed well, the others were more likely to be defeated when they played their [[Stark County, Ohio|cross-county]] arch-rival, [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]]. Therefore, a group of 35 area businessmen met on September 3, 1903, at the Hotel Sailor in Massillon to form the area's first professional football team. [[Jack Goodrich]], who expected to play [[halfback (American football)|halfback]] for the new team, was named manager. Meanwhile, [[E. J. Stewart|Ed J. Stewart]], a young and ambitious editor of the city newspaper ''The Evening Independent'', was named as the team's first coach. Stewart had playing experience while attending [[Western Reserve Academy|Western Reserve College]] and [[Mount Union College]]. Apart from being the team's coach, he later appointed himself as the team's [[quarterback]].

====Name origin====
[[J.J. Wise]], who was the Massillon Clerk of City Council, led a committee to secure the necessary funds for a new football and jerseys that were nearly the same color. The local venders only had a sufficient quantity of one jersey style to outfit an entire team. Those jerseys imitated the orange and black striped attire of the [[Princeton Tigers]], so the new Massillon team was christened the \"Tigers.\"

===1900s===

====Inaugural season====
When the Tigers began play in 1903, several of the expected starters hadn't touched a football in eight or more years. According to locals belief, [[Baldy Wittman]], 32-year-old proprietor of a local cigar store and a spare-time police officer, had never played the game at all. [[Cy Rigler|Charles \"Cy\" Rigler]], who later became a famous [[major league baseball]] umpire started at [[Offensive tackle|tackle]]. Wittman opened at an end and was elected the [[team captain]]. Meanwhile, Stewart lined himself up at quarterback. The Tigers first game against [[Wooster College]] ended in a 6-0 defeat. A biased official was the excuse for the loss.<ref name=\"Carroll, Bob 1–4\">{{cite journal|title=Ohio Tiger Trap |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;4 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Ohio_Tiger_Trap.pdf |author=Carroll, Bob |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226105857/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Ohio_Tiger_Trap.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-26 }}</ref> The Tigers followed their first ever game with a 16-0 victory over Stewart's [[alma mater]], [[Mount Union College]], a 6-0 victory over the [[Akron Imperials]], and a 38-0 over the [[Akron Blues]]. After a 34-0 victory over the [[Dennison Panhandles]], the Tigers prepared for their cross-county rivals, a sandlot team from Canton. Betting on the games, during the early 1900s was common. It is believed that over $1000 was risked on the game's outcome. The Tigers held on to a 16-0 score to win the first game between the two clubs.

After the Canton-Massillon game, the Tigers began to look at winning the mythical \"Ohio League\" championship. On [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] 1903, the Tigers avenged their only loss of the season against Wooster College with a 34-0 score. This outcome gave legitimacy to the belief that the Tigers were robbed by a corrupt official in their inaugural game.<ref name=\"Carroll, Bob 1–4\"/> On December 5, an agreement was signed by Massillon and the [[Akron East Ends]] to play. The contract called for a 75-25 split of the gate, with the winner taking the 75% of the gate. However Massillon soon found itself in a troubling situation due to injuries to several of their star players. The team's management decided to replace the injured players with \"ringers\". Several pro football players from the [[Pittsburgh]] area soon traveled to Ohio to play for Massillon. Among them was [[Bob Shiring]] and [[Harry McChesney]], who played in 1902 with the [[Pittsburgh Stars]] of the [[National Football League (1902)|first National Football League]]. These player developments did not sit well with the Akron media, most notably the ''[[Akron Beacon-Journal]]''.  Massillon would go on to win the championship game 12-0, however the ''Akron Beacon-Journal'' later stated that most of Massillon's 75% gate money went to the Pittsburgh ringers. Plans were soon in the mix for spending $1,000 on a 1904 Tigers team.<ref name=\"Carroll, Bob 1–4\"/>

===1904===
[[File:Massillon tigers team 1905.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1905 Massillon Tigers, \"Ohio League\" Champions.]]
In 1904 the Tigers repeated as Ohio League champions. It was during this time that at least seven teams in Ohio began hiring players for games. Most of these \"ringers\" were from Pittsburgh. Many players were hired on a per game basis and were never signed to any written contract. [[Ted Nesser]], of the infamous [[Nesser Brothers]], played for the [[Shelby Blues]] until he was hired to play one game for the Tigers. For the next two season he remained in the Tigers lineup.<ref name=\"PFRA Research 1–5\">{{cite journal|title=Ohio Pounce Again |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;5 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Tigers_Pounce_Again.pdf |author=PFRA Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126225418/http://profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Tigers_Pounce_Again.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-26 }}</ref> However, after the Tigers began the 1904 season, many Massillonians were bored with the ease of the Tigers' wins, even at this early stage. That season the Tigers defeated a club from [[Marion, Ohio|Marion]] 148-0. Also keep in mind that a [[touchdown]] counted only five points until 1912. However under the rules of the time, the team that scored turned around and received the next kickoff (traditionally, [[onside kick]]s were far more commonplace—and easier—at this time, but Marion chose not to use them for reasons unexplained). During the game a Massillon [[End (American football)|end]] named [[Walt Roepke]] ran a punt back for a touchdown. Marion never got another chance to handle the ball, as Massillon took kickoff after kickoff and moved down the field to touchdown after touchdown.

The Tigers defeated the Akron East Ends again (now renamed the Akron Athletic Club) 6-5 after Akron's [[Joe Fogg]] missed an [[extra point]] kick on the last play of the game.<ref name=\"PFRA Research 1–5\"/>

===Bulldogs-Tigers rivalry: 1905-1906===
By 1905 the Tigers were considered one of the top three teams in the country, along with the [[Latrobe Athletic Association]] and the [[Canton Bulldogs]]. Both teams were constantly fighting for the best players in football. In fact the Bulldogs, or Canton Athletic Club as it was called at the time, formed their football team in 1905 with sole objective of beating the Tigers, who had won every Ohio League championship since 1903.<ref name=\"Pigskin\">*{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=rCnbhSRZpgIC | title=Pigskin: The Early Years of Pro Football | first=Robert W. | last=Peterson | isbn=0-19-511913-4 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Sean|last=Lahmen|title=Canton vs. Masillon, 1906|work=In Lahmen's Terms|url=http://seanlahman.blogspot.com/2008_10_01_archive.html|date=October 10, 2008|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref>

====1905 championship====
[[File:Massillon tigers lineup 1905.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Massillon Tigers line up of 1905.]]
Both teams spent lavish amounts of money to bring in ringers from out of town. The teams first played each other twice in 1905, with Massillon winning the first game 14-4. The second game saw a 10-0 Massillon win, however the win drew protests from Canton coach [[Blondy Wallace]], who argued against a 10-ounce ball used by Massillon during the game, instead of the regular 16-ounce ball. The 10-ounce ball was provided to the Tigers by their owner, a Massillon newspaper editor. The protest fell on deaf ears, and Massillon was named the 1905 Ohio League champions.<ref name=\"PFRA\">{{cite journal|title=Blondy Wallace and the Biggest Football Scandal Ever |journal=PFRA Annual |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |volume=5 |year=1984 |pages=1&ndash;16 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/06-An-209.pdf |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uzZ0BFPf?url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/06-An-209.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-15 }}</ref>

====1906 financial charges====
In the off-season prior to the 1906 season,  a news story in ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' alleged that the Canton Athletic Club was financially broke and could not pay its players for that final game. The club denied the allegation and insisted that every dollar promised had indeed been delivered. Many Canton followers believed the story had originated in Massillon as a trick to discredit their team and make it tougher for Canton to recruit players for 1906. Massillon coach, [[E. J. Stewart|Ed Stewart]], who had newspaper connections was believed by Canton to have planted the story. However, while Canton was in fact losing money in 1905, a group of area businessmen shouldered the losses.

In a counter-charge, Canton insisted that the Tigers were also deeply in debt. However, a statement by the Tigers showed $16,037.90 in receipts and only $16,015.65 in expenditures. The only problem with Massillon's figures was that they only listed salaries, including railroad fare, at $6,740.95, which means the players were getting only about $50 per game. However, it is believed, like with Canton, that Massillon's area boosters picked up whatever losses the Tigers incurred during 1905.<ref name=\"Pigskin\"/><ref name=\"PFRA\"/>

====Recruitment====
For the 1906 season, Canton coach Wallace signed the entire [[backfield]] of the Tigers to the Canton team.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xRfnvszlOF8C| title=Outside the Lines: African Americans and the Integration of the National Football League

}}

In 1906, the Bulldogs and Tigers were involved in a game-rigging scandal that effectively killed both teams. It was the first major scandal in professional football, and the first known case of professional gamblers attempting to fix a professional sport. The ''[[The Independent (Massillon)|Massillon Independent]]'' newspaper alleged that the Bulldogs coach, Blondy Wallace, and Tigers end, [[Walter East]], had conspired to fix a two-game series between the two clubs. The conspiracy called for Canton to win the first game and Massillon to win the second, forcing a third game, which would have the largest gate. That game would be played legitimately, with the 1906 [[Ohio League]] championship at stake.

Canton denied the charges, maintaining that Massillon only wanted to damage the club's reputation. Although Massillon could not prove that Canton had indeed thrown the second game, the scandal tarnished the Bulldog and Tiger names and helped ruin professional football in Ohio until the mid 1910s. To this day the details of the scandal consist only of charges and counter-charges.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Blondy Wallace and the Biggest Football Scandal Ever |journal=PFRA Annual |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |volume=5 |year=1984 |pages=1&ndash;16 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/06-An-209.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uzZ0BFPf?url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/06-An-209.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-15 }}</ref>

===\"All-Massillons\"===
A reorganized \"All-Massillons\" played in 1907, after which professional football in Massillon effectively stopped. The team was made up of many of the former Tigers players and was managed by Sherburn Wightman. The team defeated the [[Columbus Panhandles]], with the Nesser Brothers in the line-up, 13-4, and celebrated its fifth consecutive state championship. Because of the game's importance, Massillon brought in two ringers, [[Peggy Parratt]] and [[Bob Shiring]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Glamourless Gridirons: 1907-09 |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;5 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Glamourless_Gridirons.pdf |author=PFRA Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326054129/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Glamourless_Gridirons.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-26 }}</ref>

In 1911 a Canton-Massillon game was hyped beforehand as a return to 1905-06. However, after seeing the 57-0 Canton victory, it became apparent that this Massillon team bore little resemblance to the Tiger teams of the past, although the lineup did include Tiger greats Baldy Wittmann and [[Frank Bast]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Parratt Wins Again |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;5 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Parratt_Wins_Again.pdf |author=PFRA Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326054144/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Parratt_Wins_Again.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-26 }}</ref>

===Resurrection===

====Dispute with Cusack====
During the summer of 1914, members of the Massillon Chamber of Commerce asked [[Jack Cusack]], the manager of the re-organized Canton Bulldogs, to attend a secret meeting to discuss a proposed new Massillon Tigers football team. Cusack believed that a game against a strong Massillon team and a restart of the historic Canton-Massillon rivalry was bound to bring in fans to Canton. However, in order to get the team fielded, Massillon planned to raid the [[Akron Indians]] roster of its key players. Because of this, Cusack refused to help Massillon restart their club. In 1914, an unwritten agreement existed among Ohio League managers that refrained them from raiding other teams. Also a raid of players would start a bidding war, raise players' salaries for all teams, and destroy the fragile profit margin already established. Cusack refused to provide a Canton-Massillon game if players from the Indians were raided. Plans for a new \"Tigers\" were put on hold until 1915.

====New Tigers====

=====1915=====
The Tigers returned to the Ohio League in 1915. They were backed by local businessmen, Jack Donahue and Jack Whalen. Massillon did end up raiding the Indians team of their top players. In turn Cusack took in the Akron players, and raided the [[Youngstown Patricians]], hoping to improve his team. Massillon hired new ringers for a new bidding war with Canton, however Cusack signed the legendary [[Jim Thorpe]] to his squad. The Tigers ended their 1915 season with a share of the 1915 championship with Canton. Both teams finished the season 5-2-0. One anonymous Massillon official revealed it had taken between $1,500 and $2,000 to bring in the Tigers lineup that opposed Canton in the final game, which included three players from [[Muhlenberg College]], who had their college eligibility stripped when they were discovered.<ref>{{cite news | title=College Gridders Are Declared Ineligible | newspaper=The Mansfield Shield | date=November 18, 1915 | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cqBgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QnINAAAAIBAJ&pg=4593,477284}}</ref> This would be Massillon's last \"Ohio League\" title, and a disputed one at that—the very Patricians squad that the Tigers had raided earlier in the season had racked up an even more impressive 9-0-1 record against lesser talent, including a win against the [[Washington Vigilants]], one of the East Coast's top professional teams, leading many observers to give Youngstown the title instead.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Thrope Arrives |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;5 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Thorpe_Arrives.pdf |author=PFRA Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311103541/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Thorpe_Arrives.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-11 }}</ref>

=====1916=====
The Tigers rebirth, saw the team incorporate many of the top players of the era. For example, [[Knute Rockne]], [[Charles Brickley]], [[Gus Dorais]], [[Bob Nash (American football)|Bob Nash]], [[Stan Cofall]], and, future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]], [[Greasy Neale]]. The 1916 season saw the Tigers end up in second place of the \"Ohio League\" standings behind the Canton Bulldogs. However, despite record crowds for two Bulldog-Tigers match-ups, Massillon lost money on the season, while Canton barely made a profit. Most of the Midwestern major teams were running into debt. Since every player knew Jim Thorpe was being paid $250 a game, many players of  considerably less talent were holding out for $100 or $125 a game. Team managers had to produce stars to draw crowds, but the crowds could never be big enough to pay for the stars. Teams desperately needed something like the old \"Ohio League\" sub-rosa agreement where the managers agreed to not raid other team rosters. Only that sort of agreement could hold salaries at a responsible level.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Super Bulldogs 1916 |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;5 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/The_Super_Bulldogs.pdf |author=PFRA Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906002557/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/articles/The_Super_Bulldogs.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-06 }}</ref>

=====1917=====
[[File:Massillon bulldog ad.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Massillon Tigers vs. Canton Bulldogs, advertisement for a 1917 game.]]
In 1917, Bob Nash promised an \"Ohio League\" championship to the fans in Massillon. In doing so he put together an offensive line that included [[Charlie Copley]] at tackle and [[Al Wesbecher]] at [[Center (American football)|center]]. However, after storming out to a 4-0 start, the Tigers were defeated by Stan Cofall and the Youngstown Patricians 14-6. However, later that season Cofall and [[Bob Peck (football)|Bob Peck]] decided to play for Massillon which prematurely ended the Pats 1917 campaign. However, despite their winning seasons and star talent, Massillon was still losing money. One reason for the disparity is that Massillon was smaller than Canton, meaning it had a smaller fan base to support its football team. The Tigers had highly devoted following, however they weren't enough of them. Also the city lacked a decent ballpark. as a result many of the Tigers' biggest home games were undersold. The only way to make the Tigers profitable was to use Peggy Parratt's old Akron scheme of bringing in just enough high-priced stars to win. Even then, the Tigers would have probably operated at a loss, but one small enough that it could be made up for by the team's backers. However Massillon did upset the Bulldogs in their second game of the season series 6-0, behind two field goals kicked by Cofall. But despite the upset, Canton was regarded as the U.S. champion; Massillon couldn't make a serious claim. The Tigers had lost their first game with the Bulldogs by a larger margin and dropped two other games to lesser opponents. It had not been a good season for Massillon. They lost three games on the field, and their backers dropped $4,700 at the gate. After the season, a \"Cleveland critic\" chose an all-pro team from among the four major northeastern Ohio teams. The Massillon players listed on the all-pr listing were Bob Nash, Bob Peck, [[Pike Johnson]], Charley Copley, and Stan Cofall.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Canton Wins Again 1917 |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;5 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Canton_Wins_Again.pdf |author=PFRA Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617101934/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Canton_Wins_Again.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-17 }}</ref> One of the teams Massillon would play (and defeat soundly) in 1917 was the [[Buffalo (1920s NFL teams)|Buffalo All-Stars]], who would later join the NFL as the Buffalo All-Americans in 1917.

The team suspended operations in 1918 due to a [[1918 flu pandemic|flu pandemic]] and the [[World War I|Great War]], but returned in 1919.

=====1919=====
Many of the top teams of the \"Ohio League\" returned to action in 1919. At a meeting on July 14, 1919, the managers held a \"get-together\" at Canton's Courtland Hotel. The managers decided on a pay scale for officials and agreed to refrain from stealing each other's players for the upcoming season. However, the big surprise came when Massillon backer Jack Donahue refused to go along with a proposal to limit salaries. Massillon had trouble with the increasing cost of players and would profit more by a salary cap than anyone else. Donahue insisted, \"If a manager wants to pay $10,000 for a player, that's his business.\"

The Tigers were set to begin their 1919 season in New York City against the [[New York Brickley Giants]], organized by the same Charles Brickley that had played for Massillon in 1917. However, due to a dispute over the application of New York's [[blue law]]s, that prohibited playing football on Sundays, Brickley's Giants were forced to fold.  (The Giants team would however regroup and play in the National Football League in [[1921 NFL season|1921]] and as an independent until 1923; a second, unrelated [[New York Giants]] would join the league for 1925 and this is the New York Giants team that is in the NFL today.) The Tigers did play well in 1919, however once again they came in second to Canton in the \"Ohio League\" standings. The team's backers then decided to fold the team after losing over $5,000 during the season. Stan Cofall also abandoned the Tigers after the season. He and many of the now former-Tigers players left to play for the [[Cleveland Tigers (NFL)|Cleveland Tigers]].<ref name=\"PFRA Research 1–6\">{{cite journal|title=Associating in Obscurity 1920 |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;6 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Associating_In_Obscurity.pdf |author=PFRA Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218174314/http://profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Associating_In_Obscurity.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Forward into Invisibility 1920 |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;6 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Forward_Into_Invisibility.pdf |author=PFRA Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65r51k68q?url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Forward_Into_Invisibility.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-02 }}</ref>

====Formation of the NFL====

=====Attempts to restart the Tigers=====
On August 20, 1920, during the first meeting aimed at establishing the American Professional Football Association (renamed the National Football League in 1922), there was hope that [[F.J. Griffiths]], of the Massillon steel industry, would resurrect the franchise, but the meeting passed with no word from Griffiths. During late August and early September of that same year, Ralph Hay and Jim Thorpe tried without success to find a backer for a new Massillon team. While the Tigers consistently lost money for themselves, they were always a good draw for others. In fact it was a strong rivalry with Massillion that helped lead Jim Thorpe to Canton. [[Cupid Black]], an All-America guard from Yale, was also rumored to restart the Tigers franchise, however he later turned down the offer.<ref name=\"PFRA Research 1–6\"/>

=====Vernon Maginnis issue=====
On September 17, 1920, at Ralph Hay's [[Hupmobile]] dealership in Canton, the charter members of the future NFL formally established the new league. During that meeting, the first order of business was to decide the future of the Massillon franchise. It was then that the managers were confronted by [[Vernon Maginnis]], the manager of the unsuccessful [[Akron Indians]] in 1919, who wanted to field a [[traveling team]] and call it the \"Massillon Tigers\". Hay and the other managers turned down the offer because they didn't feel the franchise would pan out and because nobody wanted to see the proud Massillon Tigers name demeaned and made a road attraction. The current Akron owners, now renamed the Pros, [[Art Ranney]] and [[Frank Nied]] were also associated with Maginnis during his ownership of the team in 1919, and had many problems with him during that season.<ref name=\"PFRA Research 1–6\"/>

Maginnis' representative was not admitted to the meeting, however the Massillon Tigers were counted as present at the charter meeting of the NFL. Hay, who'd tried to get a real Massillon team restarted, considered himself as their spokesman. Once the meeting started, he stood up and announced that Massillon was withdrawing from professional football for the season of 1920. And to resure that Maginnis wouldn't try to reestablish a Massillon \"franchise\", Hay told the American Professional Football Association managers: \"Do not schedule any `other' Massillon team\".<ref name=\"PFRA Research 1–6\"/>

=====Charter NFL member?=====
The 10 teams represented at the September 17 meeting are considered charter members of the AFPA, and, by extension, of the National Football league. Massillon is usually counted on a technicality: the team, under Hay, were there, they just never played in the new league.<ref name=\"PFRA Research 1–6\"/>

The '''Massillon Tigers''' were an early professional [[American football|football]] team from [[Massillon, Ohio]]. Playing in the \"[[Ohio League]]\", the team was a rival to the pre-[[National Football League]] version of the [[Canton Bulldogs]]. The Tigers won Ohio League championships in 1903, 1904, 1905, and 1906, then merged to become \"All-Massillons\" to win another title in 1907. The team returned as the Tigers in 1915 but, with the reemergence of the Bulldogs, only won one more Ohio League title. Pro football was popularized in Ohio when the amateur Massillon Tigers, hired four Pittsburgh pros to play in the season-ending game against Akron. At the same time, pro football declined in the [[Pittsburgh]] area, and the emphasis on the pro game moved west from [[Pennsylvania]] to Ohio.

The team opted not to join the APFA (later renamed the NFL) in 1920; it remained an independent club through 1923, when the Tigers folded. During their time as an independent, the Tigers never played against any team in the NFL, even though several other independent teams did. The Massillon Tigers team name was transferred to [[Massillon Washington High School]], which still uses it today.

==History==

===Origins===
The Massillon area had fielded several amateur football teams featuring only local players since the early 1890s. However while some had performed well, the others were more likely to be defeated when they played their [[Stark County, Ohio|cross-county]] arch-rival, [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]]. Therefore, a group of 35 area businessmen met on September 3, 1903, at the Hotel Sailor in Massillon to form the area's first professional football team. [[Jack Goodrich]], who expected to play [[halfback (American football)|halfback]] for the new team, was named manager. Meanwhile, [[E. J. Stewart|Ed J. Stewart]], a young and ambitious editor of the city newspaper ''The Evening Independent'', was named as the team's first coach. Stewart had playing experience while attending [[Western Reserve Academy|Western Reserve College]] and [[Mount Union College]]. Apart from being the team's coach, he later appointed himself as the team's [[quarterback]].

====Name origin====
[[J.J. Wise]], who was the Massillon Clerk of City Council, led a committee to secure the necessary funds for a new football and jerseys that were nearly the same color. The local venders only had a sufficient quantity of one jersey style to outfit an entire team. Those jerseys imitated the orange and black striped attire of the [[Princeton Tigers]], so the new Massillon team was christened the \"Tigers.\"

===1900s===

====Inaugural season====
When the Tigers began play in 1903, several of the expected starters hadn't touched a football in eight or more years. According to locals belief, [[Baldy Wittman]], 32-year-old proprietor of a local cigar store and a spare-time police officer, had never played the game at all. [[Cy Rigler|Charles \"Cy\" Rigler]], who later became a famous [[major league baseball]] umpire started at [[Offensive tackle|tackle]]. Wittman opened at an end and was elected the [[team captain]]. Meanwhile, Stewart lined himself up at quarterback. The Tigers first game against [[Wooster College]] ended in a 6-0 defeat. A biased official was the excuse for the loss.<ref name=\"Carroll, Bob 1–4\">{{cite journal|title=Ohio Tiger Trap |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;4 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Ohio_Tiger_Trap.pdf |author=Carroll, Bob |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226105857/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Ohio_Tiger_Trap.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-26 }}</ref> The Tigers followed their first ever game with a 16-0 victory over Stewart's [[alma mater]], [[Mount Union College]], a 6-0 victory over the [[Akron Imperials]], and a 38-0 over the [[Akron Blues]]. After a 34-0 victory over the [[Dennison Panhandles]], the Tigers prepared for their cross-county rivals, a sandlot team from Canton. Betting on the games, during the early 1900s was common. It is believed that over $1000 was risked on the game's outcome. The Tigers held on to a 16-0 score to win the first game between the two clubs.

After the Canton-Massillon game, the Tigers began to look at winning the mythical \"Ohio League\" championship. On [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] 1903, the Tigers avenged their only loss of the season against Wooster College with a 34-0 score. This outcome gave legitimacy to the belief that the Tigers were robbed by a corrupt official in their inaugural game.<ref name=\"Carroll, Bob 1–4\"/> On December 5, an agreement was signed by Massillon and the [[Akron East Ends]] to play. The contract called for a 75-25 split of the gate, with the winner taking the 75% of the gate. However Massillon soon found itself in a troubling situation due to injuries to several of their star players. The team's management decided to replace the injured players with \"ringers\". Several pro football players from the [[Pittsburgh]] area soon traveled to Ohio to play for Massillon. Among them was [[Bob Shiring]] and [[Harry McChesney]], who played in 1902 with the [[Pittsburgh Stars]] of the [[National Football League (1902)|first National Football League]]. These player developments did not sit well with the Akron media, most notably the ''[[Akron Beacon-Journal]]''.  Massillon would go on to win the championship game 12-0, however the ''Akron Beacon-Journal'' later stated that most of Massillon's 75% gate money went to the Pittsburgh ringers. Plans were soon in the mix for spending $1,000 on a 1904 Tigers team.<ref name=\"Carroll, Bob 1–4\"/>

===1904===
[[File:Massillon tigers team 1905.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1905 Massillon Tigers, \"Ohio League\" Champions.]]
In 1904 the Tigers repeated as Ohio League champions. It was during this time that at least seven teams in Ohio began hiring players for games. Most of these \"ringers\" were from Pittsburgh. Many players were hired on a per game basis and were never signed to any written contract. [[Ted Nesser]], of the infamous [[Nesser Brothers]], played for the [[Shelby Blues]] until he was hired to play one game for the Tigers. For the next two season he remained in the Tigers lineup.<ref name=\"PFRA Research 1–5\">{{cite journal|title=Ohio Pounce Again |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;5 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Tigers_Pounce_Again.pdf |author=PFRA Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126225418/http://profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Tigers_Pounce_Again.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-26 }}</ref> However, after the Tigers began the 1904 season, many Massillonians were bored with the ease of the Tigers' wins, even at this early stage. That season the Tigers defeated a club from [[Marion, Ohio|Marion]] 148-0. Also keep in mind that a [[touchdown]] counted only five points until 1912. However under the rules of the time, the team that scored turned around and received the next kickoff (traditionally, [[onside kick]]s were far more commonplace—and easier—at this time, but Marion chose not to use them for reasons unexplained). During the game a Massillon [[End (American football)|end]] named [[Walt Roepke]] ran a punt back for a touchdown. Marion never got another chance to handle the ball, as Massillon took kickoff after kickoff and moved down the field to touchdown after touchdown.

The Tigers defeated the Akron East Ends again (now renamed the Akron Athletic Club) 6-5 after Akron's [[Joe Fogg]] missed an [[extra point]] kick on the last play of the game.<ref name=\"PFRA Research 1–5\"/>

===Bulldogs-Tigers rivalry: 1905-1906===
By 1905 the Tigers were considered one of the top three teams in the country, along with the [[Latrobe Athletic Association]] and the [[Canton Bulldogs]]. Both teams were constantly fighting for the best players in football. In fact the Bulldogs, or Canton Athletic Club as it was called at the time, formed their football team in 1905 with sole objective of beating the Tigers, who had won every Ohio League championship since 1903.<ref name=\"Pigskin\">*{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=rCnbhSRZpgIC | title=Pigskin: The Early Years of Pro Football | first=Robert W. | last=Peterson | isbn=0-19-511913-4 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Sean|last=Lahmen|title=Canton vs. Masillon, 1906|work=In Lahmen's Terms|url=http://seanlahman.blogspot.com/2008_10_01_archive.html|date=October 10, 2008|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref>

====1905 championship====
[[File:Massillon tigers lineup 1905.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Massillon Tigers line up of 1905.]]
Both teams spent lavish amounts of money to bring in ringers from out of town. The teams first played each other twice in 1905, with Massillon winning the first game 14-4. The second game saw a 10-0 Massillon win, however the win drew protests from Canton coach [[Blondy Wallace]], who argued against a 10-ounce ball used by Massillon during the game, instead of the regular 16-ounce ball. The 10-ounce ball was provided to the Tigers by their owner, a Massillon newspaper editor. The protest fell on deaf ears, and Massillon was named the 1905 Ohio League champions.<ref name=\"PFRA\">{{cite journal|title=Blondy Wallace and the Biggest Football Scandal Ever |journal=PFRA Annual |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |volume=5 |year=1984 |pages=1&ndash;16 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/06-An-209.pdf |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uzZ0BFPf?url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/06-An-209.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-15 }}</ref>

====1906 financial charges====
In the off-season prior to the 1906 season,  a news story in ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' alleged that the Canton Athletic Club was financially broke and could not pay its players for that final game. The club denied the allegation and insisted that every dollar promised had indeed been delivered. Many Canton followers believed the story had originated in Massillon as a trick to discredit their team and make it tougher for Canton to recruit players for 1906. Massillon coach, [[E. J. Stewart|Ed Stewart]], who had newspaper connections was believed by Canton to have planted the story. However, while Canton was in fact losing money in 1905, a group of area businessmen shouldered the losses.

In a counter-charge, Canton insisted that the Tigers were also deeply in debt. However, a statement by the Tigers showed $16,037.90 in receipts and only $16,015.65 in expenditures. The only problem with Massillon's figures was that they only listed salaries, including railroad fare, at $6,740.95, which means the players were getting only about $50 per game. However, it is believed, like with Canton, that Massillon's area boosters picked up whatever losses the Tigers incurred during 1905.<ref name=\"Pigskin\"/><ref name=\"PFRA\"/>

====Recruitment====
For the 1906 season, Canton coach Wallace signed the entire [[backfield]] of the Tigers to the Canton team.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xRfnvszlOF8C| title=Outside the Lines: African Americans and the Integration of the National Football League

}}

In 1906, the Bulldogs and Tigers were involved in a game-rigging scandal that effectively killed both teams. It was the first major scandal in professional football, and the first known case of professional gamblers attempting to fix a professional sport. The ''[[The Independent (Massillon)|Massillon Independent]]'' newspaper alleged that the Bulldogs coach, Blondy Wallace, and Tigers end, [[Walter East]], had conspired to fix a two-game series between the two clubs. The conspiracy called for Canton to win the first game and Massillon to win the second, forcing a third game, which would have the largest gate. That game would be played legitimately, with the 1906 [[Ohio League]] championship at stake.

Canton denied the charges, maintaining that Massillon only wanted to damage the club's reputation. Although Massillon could not prove that Canton had indeed thrown the second game, the scandal tarnished the Bulldog and Tiger names and helped ruin professional football in Ohio until the mid 1910s. To this day the details of the scandal consist only of charges and counter-charges.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Blondy Wallace and the Biggest Football Scandal Ever |journal=PFRA Annual |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |volume=5 |year=1984 |pages=1&ndash;16 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/06-An-209.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uzZ0BFPf?url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/06-An-209.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-15 }}</ref>

===\"All-Massillons\"===
A reorganized \"All-Massillons\" played in 1907, after which professional football in Massillon effectively stopped. The team was made up of many of the former Tigers players and was managed by Sherburn Wightman. The team defeated the [[Columbus Panhandles]], with the Nesser Brothers in the line-up, 13-4, and celebrated its fifth consecutive state championship. Because of the game's importance, Massillon brought in two ringers, [[Peggy Parratt]] and [[Bob Shiring]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Glamourless Gridirons: 1907-09 |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;5 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Glamourless_Gridirons.pdf |author=PFRA Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326054129/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Glamourless_Gridirons.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-26 }}</ref>

In 1911 a Canton-Massillon game was hyped beforehand as a return to 1905-06. However, after seeing the 57-0 Canton victory, it became apparent that this Massillon team bore little resemblance to the Tiger teams of the past, although the lineup did include Tiger greats Baldy Wittmann and [[Frank Bast]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Parratt Wins Again |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;5 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Parratt_Wins_Again.pdf |author=PFRA Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326054144/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Parratt_Wins_Again.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-26 }}</ref>

===Resurrection===

====Dispute with Cusack====
During the summer of 1914, members of the Massillon Chamber of Commerce asked [[Jack Cusack]], the manager of the re-organized Canton Bulldogs, to attend a secret meeting to discuss a proposed new Massillon Tigers football team. Cusack believed that a game against a strong Massillon team and a restart of the historic Canton-Massillon rivalry was bound to bring in fans to Canton. However, in order to get the team fielded, Massillon planned to raid the [[Akron Indians]] roster of its key players. Because of this, Cusack refused to help Massillon restart their club. In 1914, an unwritten agreement existed among Ohio League managers that refrained them from raiding other teams. Also a raid of players would start a bidding war, raise players' salaries for all teams, and destroy the fragile profit margin already established. Cusack refused to provide a Canton-Massillon game if players from the Indians were raided. Plans for a new \"Tigers\" were put on hold until 1915.

====New Tigers====

=====1915=====
The Tigers returned to the Ohio League in 1915. They were backed by local businessmen, Jack Donahue and Jack Whalen. Massillon did end up raiding the Indians team of their top players. In turn Cusack took in the Akron players, and raided the [[Youngstown Patricians]], hoping to improve his team. Massillon hired new ringers for a new bidding war with Canton, however Cusack signed the legendary [[Jim Thorpe]] to his squad. The Tigers ended their 1915 season with a share of the 1915 championship with Canton. Both teams finished the season 5-2-0. One anonymous Massillon official revealed it had taken between $1,500 and $2,000 to bring in the Tigers lineup that opposed Canton in the final game, which included three players from [[Muhlenberg College]], who had their college eligibility stripped when they were discovered.<ref>{{cite news | title=College Gridders Are Declared Ineligible | newspaper=The Mansfield Shield | date=November 18, 1915 | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cqBgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QnINAAAAIBAJ&pg=4593,477284}}</ref> This would be Massillon's last \"Ohio League\" title, and a disputed one at that—the very Patricians squad that the Tigers had raided earlier in the season had racked up an even more impressive 9-0-1 record against lesser talent, including a win against the [[Washington Vigilants]], one of the East Coast's top professional teams, leading many observers to give Youngstown the title instead.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Thrope Arrives |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;5 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Thorpe_Arrives.pdf |author=PFRA Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311103541/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Thorpe_Arrives.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-11 }}</ref>

=====1916=====
The Tigers rebirth, saw the team incorporate many of the top players of the era. For example, [[Knute Rockne]], [[Charles Brickley]], [[Gus Dorais]], [[Bob Nash (American football)|Bob Nash]], [[Stan Cofall]], and, future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]], [[Greasy Neale]]. The 1916 season saw the Tigers end up in second place of the \"Ohio League\" standings behind the Canton Bulldogs. However, despite record crowds for two Bulldog-Tigers match-ups, Massillon lost money on the season, while Canton barely made a profit. Most of the Midwestern major teams were running into debt. Since every player knew Jim Thorpe was being paid $250 a game, many players of  considerably less talent were holding out for $100 or $125 a game. Team managers had to produce stars to draw crowds, but the crowds could never be big enough to pay for the stars. Teams desperately needed something like the old \"Ohio League\" sub-rosa agreement where the managers agreed to not raid other team rosters. Only that sort of agreement could hold salaries at a responsible level.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Super Bulldogs 1916 |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;5 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/The_Super_Bulldogs.pdf |author=PFRA Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906002557/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/articles/The_Super_Bulldogs.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-06 }}</ref>

=====1917=====
[[File:Massillon bulldog ad.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Massillon Tigers vs. Canton Bulldogs, advertisement for a 1917 game.]]
In 1917, Bob Nash promised an \"Ohio League\" championship to the fans in Massillon. In doing so he put together an offensive line that included [[Charlie Copley]] at tackle and [[Al Wesbecher]] at [[Center (American football)|center]]. However, after storming out to a 4-0 start, the Tigers were defeated by Stan Cofall and the Youngstown Patricians 14-6. However, later that season Cofall and [[Bob Peck (football)|Bob Peck]] decided to play for Massillon which prematurely ended the Pats 1917 campaign. However, despite their winning seasons and star talent, Massillon was still losing money. One reason for the disparity is that Massillon was smaller than Canton, meaning it had a smaller fan base to support its football team. The Tigers had highly devoted following, however they weren't enough of them. Also the city lacked a decent ballpark. as a result many of the Tigers' biggest home games were undersold. The only way to make the Tigers profitable was to use Peggy Parratt's old Akron scheme of bringing in just enough high-priced stars to win. Even then, the Tigers would have probably operated at a loss, but one small enough that it could be made up for by the team's backers. However Massillon did upset the Bulldogs in their second game of the season series 6-0, behind two field goals kicked by Cofall. But despite the upset, Canton was regarded as the U.S. champion; Massillon couldn't make a serious claim. The Tigers had lost their first game with the Bulldogs by a larger margin and dropped two other games to lesser opponents. It had not been a good season for Massillon. They lost three games on the field, and their backers dropped $4,700 at the gate. After the season, a \"Cleveland critic\" chose an all-pro team from among the four major northeastern Ohio teams. The Massillon players listed on the all-pr listing were Bob Nash, Bob Peck, [[Pike Johnson]], Charley Copley, and Stan Cofall.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Canton Wins Again 1917 |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;5 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Canton_Wins_Again.pdf |author=PFRA Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617101934/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Canton_Wins_Again.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-17 }}</ref> One of the teams Massillon would play (and defeat soundly) in 1917 was the [[Buffalo (1920s NFL teams)|Buffalo All-Stars]], who would later join the NFL as the Buffalo All-Americans in 1917.

The team suspended operations in 1918 due to a [[1918 flu pandemic|flu pandemic]] and the [[World War I|Great War]], but returned in 1919.

=====1919=====
Many of the top teams of the \"Ohio League\" returned to action in 1919. At a meeting on July 14, 1919, the managers held a \"get-together\" at Canton's Courtland Hotel. The managers decided on a pay scale for officials and agreed to refrain from stealing each other's players for the upcoming season. However, the big surprise came when Massillon backer Jack Donahue refused to go along with a proposal to limit salaries. Massillon had trouble with the increasing cost of players and would profit more by a salary cap than anyone else. Donahue insisted, \"If a manager wants to pay $10,000 for a player, that's his business.\"

The Tigers were set to begin their 1919 season in New York City against the [[New York Brickley Giants]], organized by the same Charles Brickley that had played for Massillon in 1917. However, due to a dispute over the application of New York's [[blue law]]s, that prohibited playing football on Sundays, Brickley's Giants were forced to fold.  (The Giants team would however regroup and play in the National Football League in [[1921 NFL season|1921]] and as an independent until 1923; a second, unrelated [[New York Giants]] would join the league for 1925 and this is the New York Giants team that is in the NFL today.) The Tigers did play well in 1919, however once again they came in second to Canton in the \"Ohio League\" standings. The team's backers then decided to fold the team after losing over $5,000 during the season. Stan Cofall also abandoned the Tigers after the season. He and many of the now former-Tigers players left to play for the [[Cleveland Tigers (NFL)|Cleveland Tigers]].<ref name=\"PFRA Research 1–6\">{{cite journal|title=Associating in Obscurity 1920 |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;6 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Associating_In_Obscurity.pdf |author=PFRA Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218174314/http://profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Associating_In_Obscurity.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Forward into Invisibility 1920 |journal=Coffin Corner |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |pages=1&ndash;6 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Forward_Into_Invisibility.pdf |author=PFRA Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65r51k68q?url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Forward_Into_Invisibility.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-02 }}</ref>

====Formation of the NFL====

=====Attempts to restart the Tigers=====
On August 20, 1920, during the first meeting aimed at establishing the American Professional Football Association (renamed the National Football League in 1922), there was hope that [[F.J. Griffiths]], of the Massillon steel industry, would resurrect the franchise, but the meeting passed with no word from Griffiths. During late August and early September of that same year, Ralph Hay and Jim Thorpe tried without success to find a backer for a new Massillon team. While the Tigers consistently lost money for themselves, they were always a good draw for others. In fact it was a strong rivalry with Massillion that helped lead Jim Thorpe to Canton. [[Cupid Black]], an All-America guard from Yale, was also rumored to restart the Tigers franchise, however he later turned down the offer.<ref name=\"PFRA Research 1–6\"/>

=====Vernon Maginnis issue=====
On September 17, 1920 at Ralph Hay's [[Hupmobile]] dealership in Canton, the charter members of the future NFL formally established the new league. During that meeting, the first order of business was to decide the future of the Massillon franchise. It was then that the managers were confronted by [[Vernon Maginnis]], the manager of the unsuccessful [[Akron Indians]] in 1919, who wanted to field a [[traveling team]] and call it the \"Massillon Tigers\". Hay and the other managers turned down the offer because they didn't feel the franchise would pan out and because nobody wanted to see the proud Massillon Tigers name demeaned and made a road attraction. The current Akron owners, now renamed the Pros, [[Art Ranney]] and [[Frank Nied]] were also associated with Maginnis during his ownership of the team in 1919, and had many problems with him during that season.<ref name=\"PFRA Research 1–6\"/>

Maginnis' representative was not admitted to the meeting, however the Massillon Tigers were counted as present at the charter meeting of the NFL. Hay, who'd tried to get a real Massillon team restarted, considered himself as their spokesman. Once the meeting started, he stood up and announced that Massillon was withdrawing from professional football for the season of 1920. And to resure that Maginnis wouldn't try to reestablish a Massillon \"franchise\", Hay told the American Professional Football Association managers: \"Do not schedule any `other' Massillon team\".<ref name=\"PFRA Research 1–6\"/>

=====Charter NFL member?=====
The 10 teams represented at the September 17 meeting are considered charter members of the AFPA, and, by extension, of the National Football league. Massillon is usually counted on a technicality: the team, under Hay, were there, they just never played in the new league.<ref name=\"PFRA Research 1–6\"/>

==History==
Jennings County was formed in 1817. It was named for the first [[Governor of Indiana]] and a nine-term congressman, [[Jonathan Jennings]]. Jennings was governor when the county was organized.<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R. S. Peale & co.|year=1875|location=Indiana|title=An Illustrated History of the State of Indiana|url=https://archive.org/details/anillustratedhi02tuttgoog| pages=[https://archive.org/details/anillustratedhi02tuttgoog/page/n568 563]}}</ref>

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of {{convert|378.34|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|376.58|sqmi}} (or 99.53%) is land and {{convert|1.76|sqmi}} (or 0.47%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>  It is a rural county, with majority of the county consisting of personal farms and woodlands.  There are only two incorporated towns in this county, Vernon, the county seat, and North Vernon.  Both are quite small and underdeveloped by urban standards.  The county is located in the center of an imaginary triangle consisting of Indianapolis, IN, Cincinnati, OH,  and Louisville, KY and requires only 1{{fraction|1|4}} hour drive time to any of these urban centers.

It is also home to the [[Muscatatuck Urban Training Center]], located just outside North Vernon, at which various training exercises and scenarios are conducted for homeland security and other similar purposes.<ref>{{cite web

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]] Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

==History==
Jennings County was formed in 1817. It was named for the first [[Governor of Indiana]] and a nine-term congressman, [[Jonathan Jennings]]. Jennings was governor when the county was organized.<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R. S. Peale & co.|year=1875|location=Indiana|title=An Illustrated History of the State of Indiana|url=https://archive.org/details/anillustratedhi02tuttgoog| pages=[https://archive.org/details/anillustratedhi02tuttgoog/page/n568 563]}}</ref>

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of {{convert|378.34|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|376.58|sqmi}} (or 99.53%) is land and {{convert|1.76|sqmi}} (or 0.47%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>  It is a rural county, with majority of the county consisting of personal farms and woodlands.  There are only two incorporated towns in this county, Vernon, the county seat, and North Vernon.  Both are quite small and underdeveloped by urban standards.  The county is located in the center of an imaginary triangle consisting of Indianapolis, IN, Cincinnati, OH,  and Louisville, KY and requires only 1{{fraction|1|4}} hour drive time to any of these urban centers.

It is also home to the [[Muscatatuck Urban Training Center]], located just outside North Vernon, at which various training exercises and scenarios are conducted for homeland security and other similar purposes.<ref>{{cite web

In [[vertebrate]] [[anatomy]], '''hip''' (or \"'''coxa'''\"<ref name=\"Diab-77\">Latin ''coxa'' was used by [[Celsus]] in the sense \"hip\", but by [[Pliny the Elder]] in the sense \"hip bone\" (Diab, p 77)</ref> in medical terminology) refers to either an anatomical region or a joint.

The '''hip region''' is located [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] and [[Anterior (anatomy)|anterior]] to the [[Buttocks|gluteal region]], [[Inferior (anatomy)|inferior]] to the [[iliac crest]], and overlying the [[greater trochanter]] of the [[femur]], or \"thigh bone\".<ref name=\"MediLexicon\">{{cite web|website=MediLexicon|url=https://www.medilexicon.com/dictionary/77165|title=hip region|accessdate=2018-08-02}}</ref> In adults, three of the bones of the pelvis have fused into the [[hip bone]] or [[acetabulum]] which forms part of the hip region.

The '''hip joint''', scientifically referred to as the '''acetabulofemoral joint''' (''art. coxae''), is the [[joint]] between the femur and [[acetabulum]] of the [[pelvis]] and its primary function is to support the weight of the body in both static (e.g. standing) and dynamic (e.g. walking or running) postures. The hip joints have very important roles in retaining balance, and for maintaining the [[Pelvic tilt|pelvic inclination angle]].

[[Hip pain|Pain of the hip]] may be the result of numerous causes, including nervous, osteoarthritic, infectious, traumatic, and genetic.

== Anatomy ==

=== Region ===
The proximal femur is largely covered by muscles and, as a consequence, the [[greater trochanter]] is often the only palpable bony structure in the hip region.<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-381\">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 381</ref>

=== Articulation ===
[[File:Hueftgelenk-gesund.jpg|thumb|Radiograph of a healthy human hip joint]]

<!-- Hip joint redirects here -->
The hip joint is a [[synovial joint]] formed by the articulation of the rounded [[Femur head|head of the femur]] and the cup-like [[acetabulum]] of the pelvis. It forms the primary connection between the bones of the lower limb and the [[axial skeleton]] of the trunk and pelvis. Both joint surfaces are covered with a strong but lubricated layer called articular hyaline [[cartilage]].

The cuplike acetabulum forms at the union of three pelvic bones&nbsp;— the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]], and [[ischium]].<ref name=\"Faller-174\">Faller (2004), pp 174-175</ref> The Y-shaped growth plate that separates them, the [[triradiate cartilage]], is fused definitively at ages 14–16.<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-365\">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 365</ref> It is a special type of spheroidal or [[ball and socket joint]] where the roughly spherical femoral head is largely contained within the acetabulum and has an average radius of curvature of 2.5&nbsp;cm.<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-378\">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 378</ref> The acetabulum grasps almost half the femoral ball, a grip augmented by a ring-shaped fibrocartilaginous lip, the [[acetabular labrum]], which extends the joint beyond the equator.<ref name=\"Faller-174\" /> The joint space between the femoral head and the superior acetabulum is normally between 2 and 7&nbsp;mm.<ref name=\"Lequesne2004\">{{cite journal|last1=Lequesne|first1=M|title=The normal hip joint space: variations in width, shape, and architecture on 223 pelvic radiographs|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|volume=63|issue=9|year=2004|pages=1145–1151|issn=0003-4967|doi=10.1136/ard.2003.018424|pmc=1755132|pmid=15308525}}</ref>

The head of the femur is attached to the shaft by a thin neck region that is often prone to fracture in the elderly, which is mainly due to the degenerative effects of [[osteoporosis]].

The acetabulum is oriented inferiorly, laterally and anteriorly, while the femoral neck is directed superiorly, medially, and slightly anteriorly.

=== Articular angles ===
* The ''transverse angle of the acetabular inlet'' (also called ''Sharp's angle'' and is generally the angle referred to by ''acetabular angle'' without further specification)<ref>{{cite journal |at=[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2739474/figure/F0002/ Figure 2]|vauthors=Saikia KC, Bhuyan SK, Rongphar R |title=Anthropometric study of the hip joint in northeastern region population with computed tomography scan |journal=Indian J Orthop |volume=42 |issue=3 <!-- |pages=260–6 -->|date=July 2008 |pmid=19753150 |pmc=2739474 |doi=10.4103/0019-5413.39572 |url=}}</ref> can be determined by measuring the angle between a line passing from the superior to the inferior acetabular rim and the horizontal plane; an angle which normally measures 51° at birth and 40° in adults, and which affects the acetabular lateral coverage of the femoral head and several other parameters.<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-379\"/>
* The ''sagittal angle of the acetabular inlet'' is an angle between a line passing from the anterior to the posterior acetabular rim and the sagittal plane.

=== Femoral neck angle ===
The angle between the longitudinal axes of the femoral neck and shaft, called the '''caput-collum-diaphyseal angle''' or CCD angle, normally measures approximately 150° in newborn and 126° in adults (''coxa norma'').<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-367\">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 367</ref>{{Dubious|date=April 2011}}

An abnormally small angle is known as ''[[coxa vara]]'' and an abnormally large angle as ''[[coxa valga]]''. Because changes in shape of the femur naturally affects the knee, ''coxa valga'' is often combined with ''[[genu varum]]'' (bow-leggedness), while ''coxa vara'' leads to ''[[genu valgum]]'' (knock-knees).<ref name=\"Platzer-196\">{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=196}}</ref>

[[File:Coxa-valga-norma-vara-000.svg|thumb|250px|Changes in trabecular patterns due to altered CCD angle. Coxa valga leads to more compression trabeculae, coxa vara to more tension trabeculae.<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-367\" />]]

Changes in the CCD angle is the result of changes in the stress patterns applied to the hip joint. Such changes, caused for example by a dislocation, change the [[trabecula]]r patterns inside the bones. Two continuous trabecular systems emerging on the auricular surface of the [[sacroiliac joint]] meander and criss-cross each other down through the hip bone, the femoral head, neck, and shaft.

* In the hip bone, one system arises on the upper part of the auricular surface to converge onto the posterior surface of the [[greater sciatic notch]], from where its trabeculae are reflected to the inferior part of the acetabulum. The other system emerges on the lower part of the auricular surface, converges at the level of the [[superior gluteal line]], and is reflected laterally onto the upper part of the acetabulum.
* In the femur, the first system lines up with a system arising from the lateral part of the femoral shaft to stretch to the inferior portion of the femoral neck and head. The other system lines up with a system in the femur stretching from the medial part of the femoral shaft to the superior part of the femoral head.<ref name=\"Palastanga-353\">Palastanga (2006), p 353</ref><!-- - ref for entire section above - -->

On the lateral side of the hip joint the [[fascia lata]] is strengthened to form the [[iliotibial tract]] which functions as a tension band and reduces the bending loads on the proximal part of the femur.<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-367\" />

=== Capsule ===
{{Main|Capsule of hip joint}}
The capsule attaches to the hip bone outside the acetabular lip which thus projects into the capsular space. On the femoral side, the distance between the head's cartilaginous rim and the capsular attachment at the base of the neck is constant, which leaves a wider extracapsular part of the neck at the back than at the front.<ref>Because the neck is wider in front than at the back.</ref><ref name=\"Platzer-198\">{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=198}}</ref>

The strong but loose fibrous capsule of the hip joint permits the hip joint to have the second largest range of movement (second only to the [[shoulder]]) and yet support the weight of the body, arms and head.

The capsule has two sets of fibers: longitudinal and circular.

* The circular fibers form a collar around the femoral neck called the [[zona orbicularis]].
* The longitudinal retinacular fibers travel along the neck and carry blood vessels.

=== Ligaments ===

}}
The hip joint is reinforced by four ligaments, of which three are extracapsular and one intracapsular.

The '''extracapsular''' ligaments are the [[Iliofemoral ligament|iliofemoral]], [[ischiofemoral ligament|ischiofemoral]], and [[pubofemoral ligament]]s attached to the bones of the pelvis (the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], [[ischium]], and [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] respectively). All three strengthen the capsule and prevent an excessive range of movement in the joint. Of these, the Y-shaped and twisted iliofemoral ligament is the strongest ligament in the human body.<ref name=\"Platzer-198\" />
In the upright position, it prevents the trunk from falling backward without the need for muscular activity. In the sitting position, it becomes relaxed, thus permitting the pelvis to tilt backward into its sitting position. The iliofemoral ligament prevents excessive adduction and internal rotation of the hip. The ischiofemoral ligament prevents medial (internal) rotation while the pubofemoral ligament restricts abduction and internal rotation of the hip joint.<ref name=\"Platzer-200\">{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=200}}</ref>
The [[zona orbicularis]], which lies like a collar around the most narrow part of the [[femur neck|femoral neck]], is covered by the other ligaments which partly radiate into it. The zona orbicularis acts like a buttonhole on the femoral head and assists in maintaining the contact in the joint.<ref name=\"Platzer-198\" />
All three ligaments become taut when the joint is extended - this stabilises the joint, and reduces the energy demand of muscles when standing<ref>[http://teachmeanatomy.net/lower-limb/the-hip-joint/ teachmeanatomy.net] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103005842/http://teachmeanatomy.net/lower-limb/the-hip-joint/ |date=2013-01-03 }}. teachmeanatomy.net. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.</ref>

The '''intracapsular''' ligament, the [[Ligament of head of femur|ligamentum teres]], is attached to a depression in the acetabulum (the acetabular notch) and a depression on the femoral head (the fovea of the head). It is only stretched when the hip is dislocated, and may then prevent further displacement.<ref name=\"Platzer-198\" />
It is not that important as a ligament but can often be vitally important as a conduit of a small artery to the head of the femur, that is, the {{visible anchor|foveal artery}}.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/825363-overview#aw2aab6b2b4 Hip Fracture in Emergency Medicine] at Medscape. Author: Moira Davenport. Updated: Apr 2, 2012</ref> This artery is not present in everyone but can become the only blood supply to the bone in the head of the femur when the neck of the femur is fractured or disrupted by injury in childhood.<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-383\">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), pp 383, 440</ref>

=== Blood supply ===
The hip joint is supplied with blood from the [[Medial circumflex femoral artery|medial circumflex femoral]] and [[Lateral circumflex femoral artery|lateral circumflex femoral]] arteries, which are both usually branches of the [[Profunda femoris artery|deep artery of the thigh]] (profunda femoris), but there are numerous variations and one or both may also arise directly from the [[femoral artery]]. There is also a small contribution from the foveal artery, a small vessel in the ligament of the head of the femur which is a branch of the [[posterior division of the obturator artery]], which becomes important to avoid [[avascular necrosis]] of the [[femur head|head of the femur]] when the blood supply from the medial and lateral circumflex arteries are disrupted (e.g. through fracture of the neck of the femur along their course).<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-383\" />

The hip has two anatomically important [[Anastomosis|anastomoses]], the [[Cruciate anastomosis|cruciate]] and the [[Trochanteric anastomosis|trochanteric anastomoses]], the latter of which provides most of the blood to the head of the femur. These anastomoses exist between the femoral artery or profunda femoris and the gluteal vessels.<ref name=\"Clemente-227\">Clemente (2006), p 227</ref>

=== Muscles and movements ===
{{Main|Muscles of the hip}}

The hip muscles act on three mutually perpendicular main axes, all of which pass through the center of the [[femur head|femoral head]], resulting in three [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] and three pair of principal directions: [[Flexion]] and [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] around a transverse axis (left-right); [[lateral rotation]] and [[medial rotation]] around a longitudinal axis (along the thigh); and [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abduction]] and [[adduction]] around a sagittal axis (forward-backward);<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-386\">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 386</ref> and a combination of these movements (i.e. [[Anatomical terms of motion#Other special motions|circumduction]], a compound movement in which the leg describes the surface of an irregular cone).<ref name=\"Platzer-200\" />
Some of the hip muscles also act on either the vertebral joints or the knee joint, that with their extensive areas of origin and/or insertion, different part of individual muscles participate in very different movements, and that the range of movement varies with the position of the hip joint.<ref name=Platzer_244>{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=244–246}}</ref><ref name=\"Platzer-244\">Platzer (2004), pp 244-246</ref>
Additionally, the [[Inferior gemellus muscle|inferior]] and [[Superior gemellus muscle|superior gemelli]] may be termed ''triceps coxae'' together with the [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]], and their function simply is to assist the latter muscle.<ref name=\"Platzer-238\">Platzer (2004), p 238</ref>

The movements of the hip joint is thus performed by a series of muscles which are here presented in order of importance<ref name=\"Platzer-244\" /> with the range of motion from the neutral zero-degree position<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-386\" /> indicated:

* '''Lateral''' or '''external rotation''' (30° with the hip extended, 50° with the hip flexed): [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]]; [[Quadratus femoris muscle|quadratus femoris]]; [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]]; dorsal fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[iliopsoas]] (including [[psoas major muscle|psoas major]] from the vertebral column); [[Obturator externus muscle|obturator externus]]; [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]], [[Adductor longus muscle|longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|brevis]], and [[Adductor minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]; and [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]]. The [[iliofemoral ligament]] inhibits lateral rotation and extension, this is why the hip can rotate laterally to a greater degree when it is flexed.
* '''Medial''' or '''internal rotation''' (40°): anterior fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[tensor fasciae latae]]; the part of [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] inserted into the [[adductor tubercle]]; and, with the leg abducted also the [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]].
* '''Extension''' or '''retroversion''' (20°): [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] (if put out of action, active standing from a sitting position is not possible, but standing and walking on a flat surface is); dorsal fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]]; and [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]. Additionally, the following thigh muscles extend the hip: [[Semimembranosus muscle|semimembranosus]], [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]], and long head of [[Biceps femoris muscle|biceps femoris]]. Maximal extension is inhibited by the [[iliofemoral ligament]].
* '''Flexion''' or '''anteversion''' (140°): the [[hip flexor]]s: [[iliopsoas]] (with psoas major from vertebral column); [[tensor fasciae latae]], [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[Adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]], and [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]]. Thigh muscles acting as hip flexors: [[Rectus femoris muscle|rectus femoris]] and [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]]. Maximal flexion is inhibited by the thigh coming in contact with the chest.
* '''Abduction''' (50° with hip extended, 80° with hip flexed): [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]]; [[tensor fasciae latae]]; [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] with its attachment at the [[fascia lata]]; [[Gluteus minimus muscle|gluteus minimus]]; [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]; and [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]]. Maximal abduction is inhibited by the neck of the femur coming into contact with the lateral pelvis. When the hips are flexed, this delays the impingement until a greater angle.
* '''Adduction''' (30° with hip extended, 20° with hip flexed): [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] with [[Adductor minimus muscle|adductor minimus]]; [[Adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]], [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] with its attachment at the [[gluteal tuberosity]]; [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]] (extends to the tibia); [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[Quadratus femoris muscle|quadratus femoris]]; and [[Obturator externus muscle|obturator externus]]. Of the thigh muscles, [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]] is especially involved in hip adduction. Maximal adduction is impeded by the thighs coming into contact with one another. This can be avoided by abducting the opposite leg, or having the legs alternately flexed/extended at the hip so they travel in different planes and do not intersect.

==Clinical significance==

}}</ref><!-- - ref does not support female hips are wider - --> The [[femur|femora]] are also more widely spaced in females, so as to widen the opening in the hip bone and thus facilitate childbirth. Finally, the ilium and its muscle attachment are shaped so as to situate the buttocks away from the birth canal, where contraction of the buttocks could otherwise damage the baby.

The female hips have long been associated with both [[fertility]] and general expression of [[human sexuality|sexuality]]. Since broad hips facilitate [[birth|child birth]] and also serve as an anatomical cue of sexual maturity, they have been seen as an attractive trait for women for thousands of years. Many of the classical poses women take when sculpted, painted or photographed, such as the ''[[Grande Odalisque]]'', serve to emphasize the prominence of their hips. Similarly, [[fashion|women's fashion]] through the ages has often drawn attention to the girth of the wearer's hips.

In [[vertebrate]] [[anatomy]], '''hip''' (or \"'''coxa'''\"<ref name=\"Diab-77\">Latin ''coxa'' was used by [[Celsus]] in the sense \"hip\", but by [[Pliny the Elder]] in the sense \"hip bone\" (Diab, p 77)</ref> in medical terminology) refers to either an anatomical region or a joint.

The '''hip region''' is located [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] and [[Anterior (anatomy)|anterior]] to the [[Buttocks|gluteal region]], [[Inferior (anatomy)|inferior]] to the [[iliac crest]], and overlying the [[greater trochanter]] of the [[femur]], or \"thigh bone\".<ref name=\"MediLexicon\">{{cite web|website=MediLexicon|url=https://www.medilexicon.com/dictionary/77165|title=hip region|accessdate=2018-08-02}}</ref> In adults, three of the bones of the pelvis have fused into the [[hip bone]] or [[acetabulum]] which forms part of the hip region.

The '''hip joint''', scientifically referred to as the '''acetabulofemoral joint''' (''art. coxae''), is the [[joint]] between the femur and [[acetabulum]] of the [[pelvis]] and its primary function is to support the weight of the body in both static (e.g. standing) and dynamic (e.g. walking or running) postures. The hip joints have very important roles in retaining balance, and for maintaining the [[Pelvic tilt|pelvic inclination angle]].

[[Hip pain|Pain of the hip]] may be the result of numerous causes, including nervous, osteoarthritic, infectious, traumatic, and genetic.

The proximal femur is largely covered by muscles and, as a consequence, the [[greater trochanter]] is often the only palpable bony structure in the hip region.<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-381\">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 381</ref>

=== Articulation ===
[[File:Hueftgelenk-gesund.jpg|thumb|Radiograph of a healthy human hip joint]]

<!-- Hip joint redirects here -->
The hip joint is a [[synovial joint]] formed by the articulation of the rounded [[Femur head|head of the femur]] and the cup-like [[acetabulum]] of the pelvis. It forms the primary connection between the bones of the lower limb and the [[axial skeleton]] of the trunk and pelvis. Both joint surfaces are covered with a strong but lubricated layer called articular hyaline [[cartilage]].

The cuplike acetabulum forms at the union of three pelvic bones&nbsp;— the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]], and [[ischium]].<ref name=\"Faller-174\">Faller (2004), pp 174-175</ref> The Y-shaped growth plate that separates them, the [[triradiate cartilage]], is fused definitively at ages 14–16.<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-365\">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 365</ref> It is a special type of spheroidal or [[ball and socket joint]] where the roughly spherical femoral head is largely contained within the acetabulum and has an average radius of curvature of 2.5&nbsp;cm.<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-378\">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 378</ref> The acetabulum grasps almost half the femoral ball, a grip augmented by a ring-shaped fibrocartilaginous lip, the [[acetabular labrum]], which extends the joint beyond the equator.<ref name=\"Faller-174\" /> The joint space between the femoral head and the superior acetabulum is normally between 2 and 7&nbsp;mm.<ref name=\"Lequesne2004\">{{cite journal|last1=Lequesne|first1=M|title=The normal hip joint space: variations in width, shape, and architecture on 223 pelvic radiographs|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|volume=63|issue=9|year=2004|pages=1145–1151|issn=0003-4967|doi=10.1136/ard.2003.018424|pmc=1755132|pmid=15308525}}</ref>

The head of the femur is attached to the shaft by a thin neck region that is often prone to fracture in the elderly, which is mainly due to the degenerative effects of [[osteoporosis]].

:*25° up to 2 years of age.<ref name=Caffey/>

=== Femoral neck angle ===
The angle between the longitudinal axes of the femoral neck and shaft, called the '''caput-collum-diaphyseal angle''' or CCD angle, normally measures approximately 150° in newborn and 126° in adults (''coxa norma'').<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-367\">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 367</ref>{{Dubious|date=April 2011}}

An abnormally small angle is known as ''[[coxa vara]]'' and an abnormally large angle as ''[[coxa valga]]''. Because changes in shape of the femur naturally affects the knee, ''coxa valga'' is often combined with ''[[genu varum]]'' (bow-leggedness), while ''coxa vara'' leads to ''[[genu valgum]]'' (knock-knees).<ref name=\"Platzer-196\">{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=196}}</ref>

[[File:Coxa-valga-norma-vara-000.svg|thumb|250px|Changes in trabecular patterns due to altered CCD angle. Coxa valga leads to more compression trabeculae, coxa vara to more tension trabeculae.<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-367\" />]]

Changes in the CCD angle is the result of changes in the stress patterns applied to the hip joint. Such changes, caused for example by a dislocation, change the [[trabecula]]r patterns inside the bones. Two continuous trabecular systems emerging on the auricular surface of the [[sacroiliac joint]] meander and criss-cross each other down through the hip bone, the femoral head, neck, and shaft.

* In the hip bone, one system arises on the upper part of the auricular surface to converge onto the posterior surface of the [[greater sciatic notch]], from where its trabeculae are reflected to the inferior part of the acetabulum. The other system emerges on the lower part of the auricular surface, converges at the level of the [[superior gluteal line]], and is reflected laterally onto the upper part of the acetabulum.
* In the femur, the first system lines up with a system arising from the lateral part of the femoral shaft to stretch to the inferior portion of the femoral neck and head. The other system lines up with a system in the femur stretching from the medial part of the femoral shaft to the superior part of the femoral head.<ref name=\"Palastanga-353\">Palastanga (2006), p 353</ref><!-- - ref for entire section above - -->

On the lateral side of the hip joint the [[fascia lata]] is strengthened to form the [[iliotibial tract]] which functions as a tension band and reduces the bending loads on the proximal part of the femur.<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-367\" />

=== Capsule ===
{{Main|Capsule of hip joint}}
The capsule attaches to the hip bone outside the acetabular lip which thus projects into the capsular space. On the femoral side, the distance between the head's cartilaginous rim and the capsular attachment at the base of the neck is constant, which leaves a wider extracapsular part of the neck at the back than at the front.<ref>Because the neck is wider in front than at the back.</ref>
<ref name=\"Platzer-198\">{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=198}}</ref>

The strong but loose fibrous capsule of the hip joint permits the hip joint to have the second largest range of movement (second only to the [[shoulder]]) and yet support the weight of the body, arms and head.

The capsule has two sets of fibers: longitudinal and circular.

* The circular fibers form a collar around the femoral neck called the [[zona orbicularis]].
* The longitudinal retinacular fibers travel along the neck and carry blood vessels.

=== Ligaments ===

}}
The hip joint is reinforced by four ligaments, of which three are extracapsular and one intracapsular.

The '''extracapsular''' ligaments are the [[Iliofemoral ligament|iliofemoral]], [[ischiofemoral ligament|ischiofemoral]], and [[pubofemoral ligament]]s attached to the bones of the pelvis (the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], [[ischium]], and [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] respectively). All three strengthen the capsule and prevent an excessive range of movement in the joint. Of these, the Y-shaped and twisted iliofemoral ligament is the strongest ligament in the human body.
<ref name=\"Platzer-198\" />
In the upright position, it prevents the trunk from falling backward without the need for muscular activity. In the sitting position, it becomes relaxed, thus permitting the pelvis to tilt backward into its sitting position. The iliofemoral ligament prevents excessive adduction and internal rotation of the hip. The ischiofemoral ligament prevents medial (internal) rotation while the pubofemoral ligament restricts abduction and internal rotation of the hip joint.
<ref name=\"Platzer-200\">{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=200}}</ref>
The [[zona orbicularis]], which lies like a collar around the most narrow part of the [[femur neck|femoral neck]], is covered by the other ligaments which partly radiate into it. The zona orbicularis acts like a buttonhole on the femoral head and assists in maintaining the contact in the joint.
<ref name=\"Platzer-198\" />
All three ligaments become taut when the joint is extended - this stabilises the joint, and reduces the energy demand of muscles when standing <ref>[http://teachmeanatomy.net/lower-limb/the-hip-joint/ teachmeanatomy.net] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103005842/http://teachmeanatomy.net/lower-limb/the-hip-joint/ |date=2013-01-03 }}. teachmeanatomy.net. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.</ref>

The '''intracapsular''' ligament, the [[Ligament of head of femur|ligamentum teres]], is attached to a depression in the acetabulum (the acetabular notch) and a depression on the femoral head (the fovea of the head). It is only stretched when the hip is dislocated, and may then prevent further displacement.
<ref name=\"Platzer-198\" />
It is not that important as a ligament but can often be vitally important as a conduit of a small artery to the head of the femur, that is, the {{visible anchor|foveal artery}}.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/825363-overview#aw2aab6b2b4 Hip Fracture in Emergency Medicine] at Medscape. Author: Moira Davenport. Updated: Apr 2, 2012</ref> This artery is not present in everyone but can become the only blood supply to the bone in the head of the femur when the neck of the femur is fractured or disrupted by injury in childhood.<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-383\">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), pp 383, 440</ref>

=== Blood supply ===
The hip joint is supplied with blood from the [[Medial circumflex femoral artery|medial circumflex femoral]] and [[Lateral circumflex femoral artery|lateral circumflex femoral]] arteries, which are both usually branches of the [[Profunda femoris artery|deep artery of the thigh]] (profunda femoris), but there are numerous variations and one or both may also arise directly from the [[femoral artery]]. There is also a small contribution from the foveal artery, a small vessel in the ligament of the head of the femur which is a branch of the [[posterior division of the obturator artery]], which becomes important to avoid [[avascular necrosis]] of the [[femur head|head of the femur]] when the blood supply from the medial and lateral circumflex arteries are disrupted (e.g. through fracture of the neck of the femur along their course).<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-383\" />

The hip has two anatomically important [[Anastomosis|anastomoses]], the [[Cruciate anastomosis|cruciate]] and the [[Trochanteric anastomosis|trochanteric anastomoses]], the latter of which provides most of the blood to the head of the femur. These anastomoses exist between the femoral artery or profunda femoris and the gluteal vessels.<ref name=\"Clemente-227\">Clemente (2006), p 227</ref>

=== Muscles and movements ===
{{Main|Muscles of the hip}}

The hip muscles act on three mutually perpendicular main axes, all of which pass through the center of the [[femur head|femoral head]], resulting in three [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] and three pair of principal directions: [[Flexion]] and [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] around a transverse axis (left-right); [[lateral rotation]] and [[medial rotation]] around a longitudinal axis (along the thigh); and [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abduction]] and [[adduction]] around a sagittal axis (forward-backward);<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-386\">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 386</ref> and a combination of these movements (i.e. [[Anatomical terms of motion#Other special motions|circumduction]], a compound movement in which the leg describes the surface of an irregular cone).<ref name=\"Platzer-200\" />
Some of the hip muscles also act on either the vertebral joints or the knee joint, that with their extensive areas of origin and/or insertion, different part of individual muscles participate in very different movements, and that the range of movement varies with the position of the hip joint.
<ref name=Platzer_244>{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=244–246}}</ref>
<ref name=\"Platzer-244\">Platzer (2004), pp 244-246</ref>
Additionally, the [[Inferior gemellus muscle|inferior]] and [[Superior gemellus muscle|superior gemelli]] may be termed ''triceps coxae'' together with the [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]], and their function simply is to assist the latter muscle.<ref name=\"Platzer-238\">Platzer (2004), p 238</ref>

The movements of the hip joint is thus performed by a series of muscles which are here presented in order of importance<ref name=\"Platzer-244\" /> with the range of motion from the neutral zero-degree position<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-386\" /> indicated:

* '''Lateral''' or '''external rotation''' (30° with the hip extended, 50° with the hip flexed): [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]]; [[Quadratus femoris muscle|quadratus femoris]]; [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]]; dorsal fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[iliopsoas]] (including [[psoas major muscle|psoas major]] from the vertebral column); [[Obturator externus muscle|obturator externus]]; [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]], [[Adductor longus muscle|longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|brevis]], and [[Adductor minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]; and [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]]. The [[iliofemoral ligament]] inhibits lateral rotation and extension, this is why the hip can rotate laterally to a greater degree when it is flexed.
* '''Medial''' or '''internal rotation''' (40°): anterior fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[tensor fasciae latae]]; the part of [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] inserted into the [[adductor tubercle]]; and, with the leg abducted also the [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]].
* '''Extension''' or '''retroversion''' (20°): [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] (if put out of action, active standing from a sitting position is not possible, but standing and walking on a flat surface is); dorsal fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]]; and [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]. Additionally, the following thigh muscles extend the hip: [[Semimembranosus muscle|semimembranosus]], [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]], and long head of [[Biceps femoris muscle|biceps femoris]]. Maximal extension is inhibited by the [[iliofemoral ligament]].
* '''Flexion''' or '''anteversion''' (140°): the [[hip flexor]]s: [[iliopsoas]] (with psoas major from vertebral column); [[tensor fasciae latae]], [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[Adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]], and [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]]. Thigh muscles acting as hip flexors: [[Rectus femoris muscle|rectus femoris]] and [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]]. Maximal flexion is inhibited by the thigh coming in contact with the chest.
* '''Abduction''' (50° with hip extended, 80° with hip flexed): [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]]; [[tensor fasciae latae]]; [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] with its attachment at the [[fascia lata]]; [[Gluteus minimus muscle|gluteus minimus]]; [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]; and [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]]. Maximal abduction is inhibited by the neck of the femur coming into contact with the lateral pelvis. When the hips are flexed, this delays the impingement until a greater angle.
* '''Adduction''' (30° with hip extended, 20° with hip flexed): [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] with [[Adductor minimus muscle|adductor minimus]]; [[Adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]], [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] with its attachment at the [[gluteal tuberosity]]; [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]] (extends to the tibia); [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[Quadratus femoris muscle|quadratus femoris]]; and [[Obturator externus muscle|obturator externus]]. Of the thigh muscles, [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]] is especially involved in hip adduction. Maximal adduction is impeded by the thighs coming into contact with one another. This can be avoided by abducting the opposite leg, or having the legs alternately flexed/extended at the hip so they travel in different planes and do not intersect.

==Clinical significance==

}}</ref><!-- - ref does not support female hips are wider - --> The [[femur|femora]] are also more widely spaced in females, so as to widen the opening in the hip bone and thus facilitate childbirth. Finally, the ilium and its muscle attachment are shaped so as to situate the buttocks away from the birth canal, where contraction of the buttocks could otherwise damage the baby.

The female hips have long been associated with both [[fertility]] and general expression of [[human sexuality|sexuality]]. Since broad hips facilitate [[birth|child birth]] and also serve as an anatomical cue of sexual maturity, they have been seen as an attractive trait for women for thousands of years. Many of the classical poses women take when sculpted, painted or photographed, such as the ''[[Grande Odalisque]]'', serve to emphasize the prominence of their hips. Similarly, [[fashion|women's fashion]] through the ages has often drawn attention to the girth of the wearer's hips.

'''Babson College''' is a [[private school|private]] [[business school]] in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]]. Established in 1919, its central focus is on [[entrepreneurship education]]. It was founded by [[Roger Babson|Roger W. Babson]] as an [[Men's colleges in the United States|all-male]] business institute but is now coeducational.

== History ==

===20th century===

====The Babson Institute====
On September 3, 1919, with an enrollment of twenty-seven students, the Babson Institute held its first classes in the former home of Roger and Grace Babson on Abbott Road in Wellesley Hills.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Roger Babson]], the founder of the school, set out to distinguish the '''Babson Institute''' from colleges offering mainly instruction in business. The Institute provided intensive training in the fundamentals of production, [[finance]] and distribution in just one academic year, rather than four. The curriculum was divided into four subject areas: practical [[economics]], [[financial management]], business psychology and personal efficiency (which covered topics such as ethics, personal hygiene and interpersonal relationships). The program's pace assumed that students would learn arts and sciences content elsewhere.

Babson favored a combination of class work and actual business training. Seasoned businessmen made up the majority of the faculty. To better prepare students for the realities of the business world, the Institute's curriculum focused more on practical experience and less on lectures. Students worked on group projects and class presentations, observed manufacturing processes during field trips to area factories and businesses, met with managers and executives, and viewed industrial films on Saturday mornings.

The institute also maintained a business environment as part of the students' everyday life. The students, required to wear professional attire, kept regular business hours (8:30&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m., Monday through Friday and 8:30&nbsp;a.m. to noon on Saturday) and were monitored by punching in and out on a time clock. They were also assigned an office desk equipped with a telephone, typewriter, adding machine, and Dictaphone. Personal secretaries typed the students' assignments and correspondence in an effort to accurately reflect the business world. Roger Babson aimed to \"prepare his students to enter their chosen careers as executives, not anonymous members of the work force.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.babson.edu/About/History.cfm |title=Babson College: History |work=babson.edu |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228002014/http://www3.babson.edu/About/History.cfm |archivedate=December 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 1969, the Babson Institute's three-year bachelor of science in business administration, still for young men only, became a four-year bachelor of science degree, the Institute became a College and women were admitted for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/babsons-history/timeline/Pages/default.aspx|title=Timeline – Babson History|first=Babson|last=College|website=www.babson.edu|accessdate=August 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826071426/http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/babsons-history/timeline/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=August 26, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===21st century===

====Three College Collaboration====
Babson is involved in a three college collaboration with [[Olin College]] and [[Wellesley College]] (a collaboration often referred to as BOW).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://centennial.babson.edu/babson100/|title=Babson 100|website=Babson Centennial|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bow3colleges.org/|title=Babson/Olin/Wellesley {{!}} Three College Collaboration|website=bow3colleges.org|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref>

==Campus==

===Wellesley Main Campus===
The main residential campus of Babson College is {{convert|350|acre|km2}} and located in the \"Babson Park\" section of [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], just fifteen miles west of [[Boston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babson.edu/About/ |title=About Babson |work=babson.edu |date=June 15, 2006 |accessdate=January 20, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101227181958/http://www3.babson.edu/About/| archivedate= December 27, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> It is adjacent to the [[Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering]].

Executive and Enterprise Education visitors have the opportunity to stay in guest rooms adjacent to the meeting center.

===Babson Boston===
The Babson Boston classroom and event space, located at 100 High Street, gives Babson a presence in downtown Boston and connects the resources of the College with the innovative companies, organizations and leaders in Boston's Financial District. Opened in 2016, this facility provides the opportunity to offer MBA courses in a location convenient to where entrepreneurial students live and work. Over the course of the academic year, there are opportunities at the Boston location for students to engage with Babson offices and resources, including graduate programs, the Graduate Center for Career Development, Graduate Admissions and the College's alumni network. From 2011 to 2016, Babson Boston campus was at 253 Summer Street in Boston's Innovation District.

===Babson San Francisco===
Babson has a San Francisco campus which includes a Blended Learning MBA program, an undergraduate semester experience and custom executive education.

===Babson Miami===
In July 2017, President [[Kerry Healey]] announced Babson's plans to expand to [[Miami, Florida]], where the Blended Learning MBA, Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) and Certificate in Advanced Management (CAM), three graduate programs are offered. Babson's new hub in Miami is located at 1200 Brickell Avenue.

'''Babson College''' is a [[private school|private]] [[business school]] in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]]. Established in 1919, its central focus is on [[entrepreneurship education]]. It was founded by [[Roger Babson|Roger W. Babson]] as an [[Men's colleges in the United States|all-male]] business institute but is now coeducational.

== History ==

===20th century===

====The Babson Institute====
On September 3, 1919, with an enrollment of twenty-seven students, the Babson Institute held its first classes in the former home of Roger and Grace Babson on Abbott Road in Wellesley Hills.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Roger Babson]], the founder of the school, set out to distinguish the '''Babson Institute''' from colleges offering mainly instruction in business. The Institute provided intensive training in the fundamentals of production, [[finance]] and distribution in just one academic year, rather than four. The curriculum was divided into four subject areas: practical [[economics]], [[financial management]], business psychology and personal efficiency (which covered topics such as ethics, personal hygiene and interpersonal relationships). The program's pace assumed that students would learn arts and sciences content elsewhere.

Babson favored a combination of class work and actual business training. Seasoned businessmen made up the majority of the faculty. To better prepare students for the realities of the business world, the Institute's curriculum focused more on practical experience and less on lectures. Students worked on group projects and class presentations, observed manufacturing processes during field trips to area factories and businesses, met with managers and executives, and viewed industrial films on Saturday mornings.

The institute also maintained a business environment as part of the students' everyday life. The students, required to wear professional attire, kept regular business hours (8:30&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m., Monday through Friday and 8:30&nbsp;a.m. to noon on Saturday) and were monitored by punching in and out on a time clock. They were also assigned an office desk equipped with a telephone, typewriter, adding machine, and Dictaphone. Personal secretaries typed the students' assignments and correspondence in an effort to accurately reflect the business world. Roger Babson aimed to \"prepare his students to enter their chosen careers as executives, not anonymous members of the work force.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.babson.edu/About/History.cfm |title=Babson College: History |work=babson.edu |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228002014/http://www3.babson.edu/About/History.cfm |archivedate=December 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 1969, the Babson Institute's three-year bachelor of science in business administration, still for young men only, became a four-year bachelor of science degree, the Institute became a College and women were admitted for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/babsons-history/timeline/Pages/default.aspx|title=Timeline – Babson History|first=Babson|last=College|website=www.babson.edu|accessdate=August 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826071426/http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/babsons-history/timeline/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=August 26, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===21st century===

====Three College Collaboration====
Babson is involved in a three college collaboration with [[Olin College]] and [[Wellesley College]] (a collaboration often referred to as BOW).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://centennial.babson.edu/babson100/|title=Babson 100|website=Babson Centennial|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bow3colleges.org/|title=Babson/Olin/Wellesley {{!}} Three College Collaboration|website=bow3colleges.org|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref>

===Babson Boston===
The Babson Boston classroom and event space, located at 100 High Street, gives Babson a presence in downtown Boston and connects the resources of the College with the innovative companies, organizations and leaders in Boston's Financial District. Opened in 2016, this facility provides the opportunity to offer MBA courses in a location convenient to where entrepreneurial students live and work. Over the course of the academic year, there are opportunities at the Boston location for students to engage with Babson offices and resources, including graduate programs, the Graduate Center for Career Development, Graduate Admissions and the College's alumni network. From 2011 to 2016, Babson Boston campus was at 253 Summer Street in Boston's Innovation District.

===Babson San Francisco===
Babson has a San Francisco campus which includes a Blended Learning MBA program, an undergraduate semester experience and custom executive education.

In July 2017, President [[Kerry Healey]] announced Babson's plans to expand to [[Miami, Florida]], where the Blended Learning MBA, Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) and Certificate in Advanced Management (CAM), three graduate programs are offered. Babson's new hub in Miami is located at 1200 Brickell Avenue.

'''Babson College''' is a [[private school|private]] [[business school]] in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]]. Established in 1919, its central focus is on [[entrepreneurship education]]. It was founded by [[Roger Babson|Roger W. Babson]] as an [[Men's colleges in the United States|all-male]] business institute but is now coeducational.

== History ==

===20th century===

====The Babson Institute====
On September 3, 1919, with an enrollment of twenty-seven students, the Babson Institute held its first classes in the former home of Roger and Grace Babson on Abbott Road in Wellesley Hills.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Roger Babson]], the founder of the school, set out to distinguish the '''Babson Institute''' from colleges offering mainly instruction in business. The Institute provided intensive training in the fundamentals of production, [[finance]] and distribution in just one academic year, rather than four. The curriculum was divided into four subject areas: practical [[economics]], [[financial management]], business psychology and personal efficiency (which covered topics such as ethics, personal hygiene and interpersonal relationships). The program's pace assumed that students would learn arts and sciences content elsewhere.

Babson favored a combination of class work and actual business training. Seasoned businessmen made up the majority of the faculty. To better prepare students for the realities of the business world, the Institute's curriculum focused more on practical experience and less on lectures. Students worked on group projects and class presentations, observed manufacturing processes during field trips to area factories and businesses, met with managers and executives, and viewed industrial films on Saturday mornings.

The institute also maintained a business environment as part of the students' everyday life. The students, required to wear professional attire, kept regular business hours (8:30&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m., Monday through Friday and 8:30&nbsp;a.m. to noon on Saturday) and were monitored by punching in and out on a time clock. They were also assigned an office desk equipped with a telephone, typewriter, adding machine, and Dictaphone. Personal secretaries typed the students' assignments and correspondence in an effort to accurately reflect the business world. Roger Babson aimed to \"prepare his students to enter their chosen careers as executives, not anonymous members of the work force.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.babson.edu/About/History.cfm |title=Babson College: History |work=babson.edu |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228002014/http://www3.babson.edu/About/History.cfm |archivedate=December 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 1969, the Babson Institute's three-year bachelor of science in business administration, still for young men only, became a four-year bachelor of science degree, the Institute became a College and women were admitted for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/babsons-history/timeline/Pages/default.aspx|title=Timeline – Babson History|first=Babson|last=College|website=www.babson.edu|accessdate=August 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826071426/http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/babsons-history/timeline/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=August 26, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===21st century===

====Three College Collaboration====
Babson is involved in a three college collaboration with [[Olin College]] and [[Wellesley College]] (a collaboration often referred to as BOW).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://centennial.babson.edu/babson100/|title=Babson 100|website=Babson Centennial|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bow3colleges.org/|title=Babson/Olin/Wellesley {{!}} Three College Collaboration|website=bow3colleges.org|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref>

==Campus==

===Wellesley Main Campus===
The main residential campus of Babson College is {{convert|350|acre|km2}} and located in the \"Babson Park\" section of [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], just fifteen miles west of [[Boston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babson.edu/About/ |title=About Babson |work=babson.edu |date=June 15, 2006 |accessdate=January 20, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101227181958/http://www3.babson.edu/About/| archivedate= December 27, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> It is adjacent to the [[Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering]]. Undergraduate and graduate students have the opportunity to take advantage of campus amenities including the student center, the cafeteria, Horn Library, multiple centers and institutes, the Webster fitness center, the Weissman Foundry the arts center, and a new centennial park known as the Kerry Murphy Healey Park. Executive and Enterprise Education visitors have the opportunity to stay in guest rooms adjacent to the meeting center.

===Babson Boston===
The Babson Boston classroom and event space, located at 100 High Street, gives Babson a presence in downtown Boston and connects the resources of the College with the innovative companies, organizations and leaders in Boston's Financial District. Opened in 2016, this facility provides the opportunity to offer MBA courses in a location convenient to where entrepreneurial students live and work. Over the course of the academic year, there are opportunities at the Boston location for students to engage with Babson offices and resources, including graduate programs, the Graduate Center for Career Development, Graduate Admissions and the College's alumni network. From 2011 to 2016, Babson Boston campus was at 253 Summer Street in Boston's Innovation District.

===Babson San Francisco===
Babson has a San Francisco campus which includes a Blended Learning MBA program, an undergraduate semester experience and custom executive education.

===Babson Miami===
In July 2017, President [[Kerry Healey]] announced Babson's plans to expand to [[Miami, Florida]], where the Blended Learning MBA, Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) and Certificate in Advanced Management (CAM), three graduate programs are offered. Babson's new hub in Miami is located at 1200 Brickell Avenue.

==Academics==

===Undergraduate===
Babson College offers all undergraduates a [[bachelor of science]] degree. Students are also given the option to declare concentrations their junior and senior year from a broad range of subjects in various business and other fields.  Programs are accredited by [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://datadirect.aacsb.edu/public/profiles/profile.cfm?runReport=1&unitid=54394&userType=All |title=AACSB: Accredited institutions |work=datadirect.aacsb.edu |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}</ref> and the College itself has been regionally accredited by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] (NEASC) since 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cihe.neasc.org/about_our_institutions/roster_of_institutions/details/8136|title=NEASC CIHE: Babson College|publisher=|accessdate=August 31, 2017}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Babson College also offers a study abroad they have created.

'''Babson College''' is a [[private school|private]] [[business school]] in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]]. Established in 1919, its central focus is on [[entrepreneurship education]]. It was founded by [[Roger Babson|Roger W. Babson]] as an [[Men's colleges in the United States|all-male]] business institute but is now coeducational.

== History ==

===20th century===

====The Babson Institute====
On September 3, 1919, with an enrollment of twenty-seven students, the Babson Institute held its first classes in the former home of Roger and Grace Babson on Abbott Road in Wellesley Hills.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Roger Babson]], the founder of the school, set out to distinguish the '''Babson Institute''' from colleges offering mainly instruction in business. The Institute provided intensive training in the fundamentals of production, [[finance]] and distribution in just one academic year, rather than four. The curriculum was divided into four subject areas: practical [[economics]], [[financial management]], business psychology and personal efficiency (which covered topics such as ethics, personal hygiene and interpersonal relationships). The program's pace assumed that students would learn arts and sciences content elsewhere.

Babson favored a combination of class work and actual business training. Seasoned businessmen made up the majority of the faculty. To better prepare students for the realities of the business world, the Institute's curriculum focused more on practical experience and less on lectures. Students worked on group projects and class presentations, observed manufacturing processes during field trips to area factories and businesses, met with managers and executives, and viewed industrial films on Saturday mornings.

The institute also maintained a business environment as part of the students' everyday life. The students, required to wear professional attire, kept regular business hours (8:30&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m., Monday through Friday and 8:30&nbsp;a.m. to noon on Saturday) and were monitored by punching in and out on a time clock. They were also assigned an office desk equipped with a telephone, typewriter, adding machine, and Dictaphone. Personal secretaries typed the students' assignments and correspondence in an effort to accurately reflect the business world. Roger Babson aimed to \"prepare his students to enter their chosen careers as executives, not anonymous members of the work force.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.babson.edu/About/History.cfm |title=Babson College: History |work=babson.edu |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228002014/http://www3.babson.edu/About/History.cfm |archivedate=December 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 1969, the Babson Institute's three-year bachelor of science in business administration, still for young men only, became a four-year bachelor of science degree, the Institute became a College and women were admitted for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/babsons-history/timeline/Pages/default.aspx|title=Timeline – Babson History|first=Babson|last=College|website=www.babson.edu|accessdate=August 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826071426/http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/babsons-history/timeline/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=August 26, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Since its origin as a [[music publisher (popular music)|music publishing]] company, Primary Wave has grown its business into a full service music company with additional in-house resources supporting music publishing, talent management, film & TV production, digital marketing, and branding.

== History ==
===2006–2015: Early years===
Primary Wave Music Publishing was founded in 2006 after an introduction of [[Courtney Love]] to founder Lawrence Mestel, resulted in the purchase of 50% of [[Kurt Cobain]]’s portion of the [[Nirvana (band)| Nirvana]] catalog. In years to come, the Nirvana purchase would galvanize Primary Wave's acquisitions of Chicago, Albert Hammond Jr., Bo Diddley, Steven Tyler, John Lennon, Lamont Dozier, Hall & Oates, Def Leppard and Maurice White's (of Earth, Wind & Fire) publishing catalogs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1340484820070415|title=Julian Lennon sells stake in Beatles songs: report|author=Reuters Editorial|date=13 April 2007|work=Reuters}}</ref>

Catalog acquisitions evolved to Primary Wave providing services in [[Synchronization_rights|synchronization licensing and placements]] in film, TV, advertising, video games, and new media.

The lottery tickets featured Aerosmith’s likeness and was promoted by a TV campaign featuring the band’s iconic rock anthem, “Dream On\". Part of the campaign allowed fans to scratch off prizes such as free concert tickets, backstage passes, and even a private performance by the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/aerosmith-let-fans-dream-on-with-lottery-tickets-20090512|title=Aerosmith collaborates with lottery ticket company for Aerosmith themed scratch off games.

'''Robert Fulton''' (November 14, 1765 – February 25, 1815) was an American [[engineer]] and [[inventor]] who is widely credited with developing a commercially successful [[steamboat]]; the first was called {{ship||North River Steamboat}} (later ''Clermont''). In 1807 that steamboat traveled on the [[Hudson River]] with passengers, from [[New York City]] to [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and back again, a round trip of {{convert|300|mi}}, in 62 hours. The success of his steamboat changed river traff my chiken
In 1800, Fulton had been commissioned by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], leader of France, to attempt to design a submarine; he produced {{ship||Nautilus|1800 submarine|2}}, the first practical [[submarine]] in history.<ref>American Treasures of the Library of Congress: [https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trr024.html \"Fulton's Submarine\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328020659/http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trr024.html |date=2009-03-28 }}</ref> Fulton is also credited with inventing some of the world's earliest naval [[torpedo]]es for use by the British [[Royal Navy]].<ref name=\"Best\">Best, Nicholas (2005). ''Trafalgar: The Untold Story of the Greatest Sea Battle in History''. London: Phoenix. {{ISBN|0-7538-2095-1}}.</ref>

Fulton became interested in [[steam engine]]s and the idea of steamboats in 1777 when he was around age 12 and visited state delegate [[William Henry (delegate)|William Henry]] of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], who was interested in this topic. Henry had learned about inventor [[James Watt]] and his [[Watt steam engine]] on an earlier visit to [[England]].

==Early life==
[[File:FultonNautilus.jpg|thumb|A drawing of Fulton's invention {{ship||Nautilus|1800 submarine|2}}]]
Robert Fulton was born on a farm in [[Little Britain Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Little Britain, Pennsylvania]], on November 14, 1765.  His father, Robert Fulton, married Mary Smith, daughter of Captain Joseph Smith and sister of Col. Lester Smith,<ref name=Reynolds1911/> a comparatively well off family.<ref name=\"Philip2003\">{{cite book |last1=Philip |first1=Cynthia Owen |title=Robert Fulton: A Biography |date=2003 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=9780595262038 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4zjI4-YrRE4C&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3 |accessdate=8 November 2019 |language=en}}</ref>  He had three sisters – Isabella,  Elizabeth, and Mary, and a younger brother, Abraham.<ref name=\"buckman\">{{cite book|url=http://www.hrmm.org/diglib/oldsteam/chapter1.html |title=Old Steamboat Days on The Hudson River |first=David Lear |last=Buckman |publisher=The Grafton Press |year=1907 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826072827/http://www.hrmm.org/diglib/oldsteam/chapter1.html |archivedate=August 26, 2010 }}</ref>

For six years, he lived in [[Philadelphia]], where he painted portraits and landscapes, drew houses and machinery, and was able to send money home to help support his mother. In 1785, Fulton bought a farm at [[Hopewell Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania|Hopewell Township]] in [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]] near [[Pittsburgh]] for £80 <!-- according to {{Inflation|UK|80|1785}}, £80 = £9,956 in 2018 pounds --> (equivalent to ${{To USD|9956|GBR|round=yes}} in 2018),{{Inflation/fn|UK}} and moved his mother and family into it.

== Work ==
=== Career in Europe (1786–1806) ===
[[File:Fulton's submarine design.jpg|alt=Fulton's 1806 submarine design for the U.S. government.|thumb|Fulton's 1806 submarine design for the U.S. government.]]
At the age of 23, Fulton traveled to Europe, where he would live for the next twenty years. He went to England in 1786, carrying several letters of introduction to Americans abroad from prominent individuals he had met in Philadelphia. He had already corresponded with artist [[Benjamin West]]; their fathers had been close friends. West took Fulton into his home, where Fulton lived for several years and studied painting. Fulton gained many commissions painting portraits and landscapes, which allowed him to support himself. He continued to experiment with mechanical inventions.<ref name=buckman/>

Fulton became caught up in the enthusiasm of the \"Canal Mania\". In 1793 he began developing his ideas for [[tugboat]] [[canal]]s with inclined planes instead of locks. He obtained a patent for this idea in 1794 and also  began working on ideas for the steam power of boats. He published a pamphlet about canals and patented a [[Dredging|dredging machine]] and several other inventions. In 1794, he moved to [[Manchester]] to gain practical knowledge of English canal engineering. While there he became friendly with [[Robert Owen]], a cotton manufacturer and early [[socialist]]. Owen agreed to finance the development and promotion of Fulton's designs for inclined planes and earth-digging machines; he was instrumental in introducing the American to a canal company, which awarded him a sub-contract. But Fulton was not successful at this practical effort and he gave up the contract after a short time.<ref>Boyes, Graham. ''The Peak Forest Canal''. {{ISBN|9780901461599}}.</ref>

[[File:Robert Fulton por HOUDON, Jean-Antoine 1803.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of Robert Fulton by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], 1803.]]

As early as 1793, Fulton proposed plans for steam-powered vessels to both the United States and British governments. The first [[steamship]]s had appeared considerably earlier. The earliest steam-powered ship, in which the engine moved oars, was built by [[Claude de Jouffroy]] in France. Called ''Palmipède'', it was tested on the [[Doubs (river)|Doubs]] in 1776. In 1783, de Jouffroy built {{ship||Phyroscaphe}}, the first paddle steamer, which sailed successfully on the [[Saône]]. The first successful trial run of a steamboat in America had been made by inventor [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]], on the [[Delaware River]] on August 22, 1787. [[William Symington]] had successfully tried steamboats in 1788, and it seems probable that Fulton was aware of these developments.

In Britain, Fulton met the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|Duke of Bridgewater, Francis Egerton]], whose canal, the first to be constructed in the country, was being used for trials of a steam tug. Fulton became very enthusiastic about the canals, and wrote a 1796 treatise on canal construction, suggesting improvements to locks and other features. Working for the Duke of Bridgewater between 1796 and 1799, Fulton had a boat constructed in the Duke's timber yard, under the supervision of [[Benjamin Powell]]. After installation of the machinery supplied by the engineers Bateman and Sherratt of Salford, the boat was duly christened ''Bonaparte'' in honour of Fulton having served under [[Napoleon]]. After expensive trials, because of the configuration of the design, the team feared the paddles might damage the clay lining of the canal and eventually abandoned the experiment. In 1801, Bridgewater instead ordered eight vessels for his canal based on {{ship||Charlotte Dundas}}, constructed by Symington. 

[[File:Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment 9 August 1803.jpg|thumb|Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment of August 9, 1803.]]

In 1797 Fulton went to [[Paris]], where he was well known as an inventor. He studied [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], along with mathematics and chemistry. In Paris, Fulton met [[James Rumsey]], an inventor from [[Virginia]] with an interest in steamboats, who in 1786 ran his own first steamboat up the [[Potomac River]]. Fulton also exhibited the first [[panorama]] painting to be shown in Paris, [[Pierre Prévost (painter)|Pierre Prévost]]'s ''Vue de Paris depuis les Tuileries'' (1800), on what is still called ''Rue des Panoramas'' (Panorama Street) today.<ref name=sutcliffe63>[[#sutcliffe|Sutcliffe, 1909]], p. 63.</ref> While living in France, Fulton designed the first working muscle-powered submarine, {{ship||Nautilus|1800 submarine|2}}, between 1793 and 1797. He also experimented with torpedoes. When tested, his submarine operated underwater for 17 minutes in 25 feet of water. He asked the government to subsidize its construction, but he was turned down twice. Eventually he approached the [[Minister of Marine (France)|Minister of Marine]] and in 1800 was granted permission to build.<ref name=\"Burgess1\">{{cite book|author=Burgess, Robert Forrest|title=Ships Beneath the Sea|url=https://archive.org/details/shipsbeneathseaa00burg|year=1975|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-008958-7|url-access=registration|author-link=Robert Forrest Burgess}}</ref> The shipyard Perrier in [[Rouen]] built it, and the submarine sailed first in July 1800 on the [[Seine River]] in the same city.

[[File:Plaque commémorative à Robert Fulton, Rouen.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque to Robert Fulton in the port of [[Rouen]], made in 1918 to thank the United States for their involvement in the First World War]]

In France, Fulton met [[Robert Livingston (1746–1813)|Robert R. Livingston]], who was appointed [[U.S. Ambassador to France]] in 1801. He also had a scientifically curious mind, and the two men decided to collaborate on building a steamboat and to try operating it on the Seine. Fulton experimented with the water resistance of various hull shapes, made drawings and models, and had a steamboat constructed. At the first trial the boat ran perfectly, but the hull was later rebuilt and strengthened. On August 9, 1803, when this boat was driven up the River Seine, it sank. The boat was {{convert|66|ft|m|1}} long, with an {{convert|8|ft|m|1|adj=on}} beam, and made between {{convert|3|and|4|mph|km/h}} against the current.

In 1804, Fulton [[allegiance|switched allegiance]] and moved to Britain, where he was commissioned by Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]] to build a range of weapons for use by the [[Royal Navy]] during [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon's]] invasion scares. Among his inventions were the world's first modern naval \"torpedoes\" (modern \"mines\"). These were tested, along with several other of his inventions, during the 1804 [[Raid on Boulogne]], but met with limited success. Although Fulton continued to develop his inventions with the British until 1806, the decisive naval victory by Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] at the 1805 [[Battle of Trafalgar]] greatly reduced the risk of French invasion. Fulton was increasingly ignored.<ref name=\"Best\"/>

=== Career in the United States (1806–1815) ===
In 1806, Fulton returned to the United States. In 1807, he and Robert R. Livingston built the first commercially successful steamboat, {{ship||North River Steamboat}} (later known as ''Clermont''). Livingston's shipping company began using it to carry passengers between [[New York City]] and up the Hudson River to the state capital [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. ''Clermont'' made the {{convert|150|mi|km|adj=on}} trip in 32 hours. Passengers on the [[maiden voyage]] included a lawyer Jones and his family from [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]]. His infant daughter Alexandra Jones later served as a [[Union (Civil War)|Union]] nurse on a steamboat hospital in the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Alice Crary Sutcliffe, ''Robert Fulton and the 'Claremont' ''</ref>

From 1811 until his death, Fulton was a member of the [[Erie Canal Commission]], appointed by the [[Governor of New York]].

Fulton's final design was the [[floating battery]] {{ship|United States floating battery|Demologos||2}}. This first steam-driven warship in the world was built for the [[United States Navy]] for the [[War of 1812]]. The heavy vessel was not completed until after Fulton's death and was named in his honor.

From October 1811 to January 1812, Fulton, along with Livingston and [[Nicholas Roosevelt (inventor)|Nicholas Roosevelt]] (1767–1854), worked together on a joint project to build a new steamboat, {{ship||New Orleans|steamboat|2}}, sturdy enough to take down the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers to [[New Orleans]], Louisiana. It traveled from industrial [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], where it was built, with stops at [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling, Virginia]]; [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; past the \"[[Falls of the Ohio]]\" at [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; to near [[Cairo, Illinois]], and the confluence with the Mississippi River; and down past [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and [[Natchez, Mississippi]], to New Orleans some {{convert|90|mi}} by river from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast. This was less than a decade after the United States had acquired the [[Louisiana Territory]] from [[France]]. These rivers were not well settled, mapped, or protected. By achieving this first breakthrough voyage and also proving the ability of the steamboat to travel upstream against powerful river currents, Fulton changed the entire trade and transportation outlook for the American heartland.

Fulton was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1814.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistf|title=MemberListF|work=American Antiquarian Society}}</ref>

==Personal life==
On January 8, 1808, Fulton married Harriet Livingston (1786–1824), the daughter of [[Walter Livingston]] and niece of Robert Livingston, prominent men in the Hudson River area, whose family dated to the colonial era.<ref name=Reynolds1911>{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Cuyler |title=Hudson-Mohawk Genealogical and Family Memoirs: A Record of Achievements of the People of the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys in New York State, Included Within the Present Counties of Albany, Rensselaer, Washington, Saratoga, Montgomery, Fulton, Schenectady, Columbia and Greene |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_b4k-AAAAYAAJ |year=1911 |publisher=Lewis Historical Publishing Company |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_b4k-AAAAYAAJ/page/n370 302]–303}}</ref><ref name=Lancaster1909>{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PP47AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA227 |year=1909 |pages=227–228}}</ref>  Harriet, who was nineteen years his junior, was well educated and was an accomplished amateur painter and musician.<ref name=\"Philip2003\"/>  Together, they had four children:<ref name=\"LCHS1909\">{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society: January 8, 1909.

Fulton died in 1815 in New York City from [[tuberculosis]] (then known as \"consumption\"). He had been walking home on the frozen Hudson River when one of his friends, Addis Emmet, fell through the ice. In the attempt to rescue his friend, Fulton got soaked with icy water. He is believed to have contracted [[pneumonia]]. When he got home, his sickness worsened. He was diagnosed with consumption and died at 49 years old. After his death, his widow remarried to Charles Augustus Dale on November 26, 1816.

He is buried in the [[Trinity Church Cemetery]] for [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church (Episcopal)]] at [[Wall Street]] in New York City, near other notable Americans such as former [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretaries of the Treasury]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Albert Gallatin]].

==Legacy==
=== Posthumous honors ===
The Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] donated a [[Robert Fulton (Roberts)|marble statue of Fulton]] to the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] in the [[United States Capitol]]. Fulton was also honored for his development of [[steamship]] technology in New York City's [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]] of the Centennial in 1909. A replica of his first steam-powered steam vessel, ''Clermont'', was built for the occasion.

Five ships of the [[United States Navy]] have borne the name {{USS|Fulton}} in honor of Robert Fulton.

Fulton Hall at the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]] houses the Department of Marine Engineering and included laboratories for diesel and steam engineering, refrigeration, marine engineering, thermodynamics, materials testing, machine shop, mechanical engineering, welding, electrical machinery, control systems, electric circuits, engine room simulators and graphics.

===In popular culture===
[[20th Century-Fox]]'s 1940 film, ''[[Little Old New York]]'', based on a 1920 play by [[Rida Johnson Young]], is a fictionalized version of Fulton's life from his arrival in New York to the first sailing of ''Clermont''. British actor [[Richard Greene]] starred as Fulton with Brenda Joyce as Harriet Livingston. [[Alice Faye]] and [[Fred MacMurray]] played wharf friends who help Fulton overcome problems to realize his dream. 

A fictionalized account of Fulton's role was produced by [[BBC]] television during the 1960s. In the first serial, ''Triton'' (1961,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/2a0da136dd914fc181a70f256b441695|title=Triton: Part 2|website=BBC Genome|access-date=8 December 2018}}</ref> re-made in 1968), two British naval officers, Captain Belwether and Lieutenant Lamb, are involved in spying on Fulton while he is working for the French. In the sequel, ''Pegasus'' (1969), they are surprised to find themselves working with Fulton, played by Robert Cawdron. In the 1961 version, Fulton was played by [[Reed De Rouen]].

A Robert Fulton cartoon character appears in ''[[Casper the Friendly Ghost]]'' short film titled \"Red, White, and Boo.\"

Author [[James McGee (author)|James McGee]] used Fulton's experiments in early submarine warfare (against wooden warships) as a major plot element in his novel ''Ratcatcher''

''Invasion'', {{ISBN|9780340961155}}, the tenth novel in the \"Kydd\" naval warfare series by [[Julian Stockwin]], uses Fulton and his submarine as an important plot element.

Until 2016, [[Disney Springs]] at [[Walt Disney World]] had a restaurant named Fulton's Crab House with a building in the shape of a steamboat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-fultons-crabhouse-paddlefish-20160425-story.html|title=Fulton's Crab House at Disney Springs changing to Paddlefish|last=Arnold|first=Kyle|work=OrlandoSentinel.com|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-et-paddlefish-disney-springs-20170203-story.html|title=First Look: Paddlefish in Disney Springs|last=Delgado|first=Lauren|work=OrlandoSentinel.com|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en-US}}</ref>

'''Robert Fulton''' (November 14, 1765 – February 25, 1815) was an American [[engineer]] and [[inventor]] who is widely credited with developing a commercially successful [[steamboat]]; the first was called {{ship||North River Steamboat}} (later ''Clermont''). In 1807 that steamboat traveled on the [[Hudson River]] with passengers, from [[New York City]] to [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and back again, a round trip of {{convert|300|mi}}, in 62 hours. The success of his steamboat changed river traffic and trade on major American rivers.

In 1800, Fulton had been commissioned by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], leader of France, to attempt to design a submarine; he produced {{ship||Nautilus|1800 submarine|2}}, the first practical [[submarine]] in history.<ref>American Treasures of the Library of Congress: [https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trr024.html \"Fulton's Submarine\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328020659/http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trr024.html |date=2009-03-28 }}</ref> Fulton is also credited with inventing some of the world's earliest naval [[torpedo]]es for use by the British [[Royal Navy]].<ref name=\"Best\">Best, Nicholas (2005). ''Trafalgar: The Untold Story of the Greatest Sea Battle in History''. London: Phoenix. {{ISBN|0-7538-2095-1}}.</ref>

Fulton became interested in [[steam engine]]s and the idea of steamboats in 1777 when he was around age 12 and visited state delegate [[William Henry (delegate)|William Henry]] of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], who was interested in this topic. Henry had learned about inventor [[James Watt]] and his [[Watt steam engine]] on an earlier visit to [[England]].

==Early life==
[[File:FultonNautilus.jpg|thumb|A drawing of Fulton's invention {{ship||Nautilus|1800 submarine|2}}]]
Robert Fulton was born on a farm in [[Little Britain Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Little Britain, Pennsylvania]], on November 14, 1765.  His father, Robert Fulton, married Mary Smith, daughter of Captain Joseph Smith and sister of Col. Lester Smith,<ref name=Reynolds1911/> a comparatively well off family.<ref name=\"Philip2003\">{{cite book |last1=Philip |first1=Cynthia Owen |title=Robert Fulton: A Biography |date=2003 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=9780595262038 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4zjI4-YrRE4C&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3 |accessdate=8 November 2019 |language=en}}</ref>  He had three sisters – Isabella,  Elizabeth, and Mary, and a younger brother, Abraham.<ref name=\"buckman\">{{cite book|url=http://www.hrmm.org/diglib/oldsteam/chapter1.html |title=Old Steamboat Days on The Hudson River |first=David Lear |last=Buckman |publisher=The Grafton Press |year=1907 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826072827/http://www.hrmm.org/diglib/oldsteam/chapter1.html |archivedate=August 26, 2010 }}</ref>

For six years, he lived in [[Philadelphia]], where he painted portraits and landscapes, drew houses and machinery, and was able to send money home to help support his mother. In 1785, Fulton bought a farm at [[Hopewell Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania|Hopewell Township]] in [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]] near [[Pittsburgh]] for £80 <!-- according to {{Inflation|UK|80|1785}}, £80 = £9,956 in 2018 pounds --> (equivalent to ${{To USD|9956|GBR|round=yes}} in 2018),{{Inflation/fn|UK}} and moved his mother and family into it.

== Work ==
=== Career in Europe (1786–1806) ===
[[File:Fulton's submarine design.jpg|alt=Fulton's 1806 submarine design for the U.S. government.|thumb|Fulton's 1806 submarine design for the U.S. government.]]
At the age of 23, Fulton traveled to Europe, where he would live for the next twenty years. He went to England in 1786, carrying several letters of introduction to Americans abroad from prominent individuals he had met in Philadelphia. He had already corresponded with artist [[Benjamin West]]; their fathers had been close friends. West took Fulton into his home, where Fulton lived for several years and studied painting. Fulton gained many commissions painting portraits and landscapes, which allowed him to support himself. He continued to experiment with mechanical inventions.<ref name=buckman/>

Fulton became caught up in the enthusiasm of the \"Canal Mania\". In 1793 he began developing his ideas for [[tugboat]] [[canal]]s with inclined planes instead of locks. He obtained a patent for this idea in 1794 and also  began working on ideas for the steam power of boats. He published a pamphlet about canals and patented a [[Dredging|dredging machine]] and several other inventions. In 1794, he moved to [[Manchester]] to gain practical knowledge of English canal engineering. While there he became friendly with [[Robert Owen]], a cotton manufacturer and early [[socialist]]. Owen agreed to finance the development and promotion of Fulton's designs for inclined planes and earth-digging machines; he was instrumental in introducing the American to a canal company, which awarded him a sub-contract. But Fulton was not successful at this practical effort and he gave up the contract after a short time.<ref>Boyes, Graham. ''The Peak Forest Canal''. {{ISBN|9780901461599}}.</ref>

[[File:Robert Fulton por HOUDON, Jean-Antoine 1803.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of Robert Fulton by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], 1803.]]

As early as 1793, Fulton proposed plans for steam-powered vessels to both the United States and British governments. The first [[steamship]]s had appeared considerably earlier. The earliest steam-powered ship, in which the engine moved oars, was built by [[Claude de Jouffroy]] in France. Called ''Palmipède'', it was tested on the [[Doubs (river)|Doubs]] in 1776. In 1783, de Jouffroy built {{ship||Phyroscaphe}}, the first paddle steamer, which sailed successfully on the [[Saône]]. The first successful trial run of a steamboat in America had been made by inventor [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]], on the [[Delaware River]] on August 22, 1787. [[William Symington]] had successfully tried steamboats in 1788, and it seems probable that Fulton was aware of these developments.

In Britain, Fulton met the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|Duke of Bridgewater, Francis Egerton]], whose canal, the first to be constructed in the country, was being used for trials of a steam tug. Fulton became very enthusiastic about the canals, and wrote a 1796 treatise on canal construction, suggesting improvements to locks and other features. Working for the Duke of Bridgewater between 1796 and 1799, Fulton had a boat constructed in the Duke's timber yard, under the supervision of [[Benjamin Powell]]. After installation of the machinery supplied by the engineers Bateman and Sherratt of Salford, the boat was duly christened ''Bonaparte'' in honour of Fulton having served under [[Napoleon]]. After expensive trials, because of the configuration of the design, the team feared the paddles might damage the clay lining of the canal and eventually abandoned the experiment. In 1801, Bridgewater instead ordered eight vessels for his canal based on {{ship||Charlotte Dundas}}, constructed by Symington. 

[[File:Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment 9 August 1803.jpg|thumb|Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment of August 9, 1803.]]

In 1797 Fulton went to [[Paris]], where he was well known as an inventor. He studied [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], along with mathematics and chemistry. In Paris, Fulton met [[James Rumsey]], an inventor from [[Virginia]] with an interest in steamboats, who in 1786 ran his own first steamboat up the [[Potomac River]]. Fulton also exhibited the first [[panorama]] painting to be shown in Paris, [[Pierre Prévost (painter)|Pierre Prévost]]'s ''Vue de Paris depuis les Tuileries'' (1800), on what is still called ''Rue des Panoramas'' (Panorama Street) today.<ref name=sutcliffe63>[[#sutcliffe|Sutcliffe, 1909]], p. 63.</ref> While living in France, Fulton designed the first working muscle-powered submarine, {{ship||Nautilus|1800 submarine|2}}, between 1793 and 1797. He also experimented with torpedoes. When tested, his submarine operated underwater for 17 minutes in 25 feet of water. He asked the government to subsidize its construction, but he was turned down twice. Eventually he approached the [[Minister of Marine (France)|Minister of Marine]] and in 1800 was granted permission to build.<ref name=\"Burgess1\">{{cite book|author=Burgess, Robert Forrest|title=Ships Beneath the Sea|url=https://archive.org/details/shipsbeneathseaa00burg|year=1975|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-008958-7|url-access=registration|author-link=Robert Forrest Burgess}}</ref> The shipyard Perrier in [[Rouen]] built it, and the submarine sailed first in July 1800 on the [[Seine River]] in the same city.

[[File:Plaque commémorative à Robert Fulton, Rouen.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque to Robert Fulton in the port of [[Rouen]], made in 1918 to thank the United States for their involvement in the First World War]]

In France, Fulton met [[Robert Livingston (1746–1813)|Robert R. Livingston]], who was appointed [[U.S. Ambassador to France]] in 1801. He also had a scientifically curious mind, and the two men decided to collaborate on building a steamboat and to try operating it on the Seine. Fulton experimented with the water resistance of various hull shapes, made drawings and models, and had a steamboat constructed. At the first trial the boat ran perfectly, but the hull was later rebuilt and strengthened. On August 9, 1803, when this boat was driven up the River Seine, it sank. The boat was {{convert|66|ft|m|1}} long, with an {{convert|8|ft|m|1|adj=on}} beam, and made between {{convert|3|and|4|mph|km/h}} against the current.

In 1804, Fulton [[allegiance|switched allegiance]] and moved to Britain, where he was commissioned by Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]] to build a range of weapons for use by the [[Royal Navy]] during [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon's]] invasion scares. Among his inventions were the world's first modern naval \"torpedoes\" (modern \"mines\"). These were tested, along with several other of his inventions, during the 1804 [[Raid on Boulogne]], but met with limited success. Although Fulton continued to develop his inventions with the British until 1806, the decisive naval victory by Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] at the 1805 [[Battle of Trafalgar]] greatly reduced the risk of French invasion. Fulton was increasingly ignored.<ref name=\"Best\"/>

=== Career in the United States (1806–1815) ===
In 1806, Fulton returned to the United States. In 1807, he and Robert R. Livingston built the first commercially successful steamboat, {{ship||North River Steamboat}} (later known as ''Clermont''). Livingston's shipping company began using it to carry passengers between [[New York City]] and up the Hudson River to the state capital [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. ''Clermont'' made the {{convert|150|mi|km|adj=on}} trip in 32 hours. Passengers on the [[maiden voyage]] included a lawyer Jones and his family from [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]]. His infant daughter Alexandra Jones later served as a [[Union (Civil War)|Union]] nurse on a steamboat hospital in the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Alice Crary Sutcliffe, ''Robert Fulton and the 'Claremont' ''</ref>

From 1811 until his death, Fulton was a member of the [[Erie Canal Commission]], appointed by the [[Governor of New York]].

Fulton's final design was the [[floating battery]] {{ship|United States floating battery|Demologos||2}}. This first steam-driven warship in the world was built for the [[United States Navy]] for the [[War of 1812]]. The heavy vessel was not completed until after Fulton's death and was named in his honor.

From October 1811 to January 1812, Fulton, along with Livingston and [[Nicholas Roosevelt (inventor)|Nicholas Roosevelt]] (1767–1854), worked together on a joint project to build a new steamboat, {{ship||New Orleans|steamboat|2}}, sturdy enough to take down the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers to [[New Orleans]], Louisiana. It traveled from industrial [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], where it was built, with stops at [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling, Virginia]]; [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; past the \"[[Falls of the Ohio]]\" at [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; to near [[Cairo, Illinois]], and the confluence with the Mississippi River; and down past [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and [[Natchez, Mississippi]], to New Orleans some {{convert|90|mi}} by river from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast. This was less than a decade after the United States had acquired the [[Louisiana Territory]] from [[France]]. These rivers were not well settled, mapped, or protected. By achieving this first breakthrough voyage and also proving the ability of the steamboat to travel upstream against powerful river currents, Fulton changed the entire trade and transportation outlook for the American heartland.

Fulton was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1814.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistf|title=MemberListF|work=American Antiquarian Society}}</ref>

==Personal life==
On January 8, 1808, Fulton married Harriet Livingston (1786–1824), the daughter of [[Walter Livingston]] and niece of Robert Livingston, prominent men in the Hudson River area, whose family dated to the colonial era.<ref name=Reynolds1911>{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Cuyler |title=Hudson-Mohawk Genealogical and Family Memoirs: A Record of Achievements of the People of the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys in New York State, Included Within the Present Counties of Albany, Rensselaer, Washington, Saratoga, Montgomery, Fulton, Schenectady, Columbia and Greene |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_b4k-AAAAYAAJ |year=1911 |publisher=Lewis Historical Publishing Company |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_b4k-AAAAYAAJ/page/n370 302]–303}}</ref><ref name=Lancaster1909>{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PP47AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA227 |year=1909 |pages=227–228}}</ref>  Harriet, who was nineteen years his junior, was well educated and was an accomplished amateur painter and musician.<ref name=\"Philip2003\"/>  Together, they had four children:<ref name=\"LCHS1909\">{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society: January 8, 1909.

Fulton died in 1815 in New York City from [[tuberculosis]] (then known as \"consumption\"). He had been walking home on the frozen Hudson River when one of his friends, Addis Emmet, fell through the ice. In the attempt to rescue his friend, Fulton got soaked with icy water. He is believed to have contracted [[pneumonia]]. When he got home, his sickness worsened. He was diagnosed with consumption and died at 49 years old. After his death, his widow remarried to Charles Augustus Dale on November 26, 1816.

He is buried in the [[Trinity Church Cemetery]] for [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church (Episcopal)]] at [[Wall Street]] in New York City, near other notable Americans such as former [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretaries of the Treasury]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Albert Gallatin]].

==Legacy==
=== Posthumous honors ===
The Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] donated a [[Robert Fulton (Roberts)|marble statue of Fulton]] to the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] in the [[United States Capitol]]. Fulton was also honored for his development of [[steamship]] technology in New York City's [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]] of the Centennial in 1909. A replica of his first steam-powered steam vessel, ''Clermont'', was built for the occasion.

Five ships of the [[United States Navy]] have borne the name {{USS|Fulton}} in honor of Robert Fulton.

===In popular culture===
[[20th Century-Fox]]'s 1940 film, ''[[Little Old New York]]'', based on a 1920 play by [[Rida Johnson Young]], is a fictionalized version of Fulton's life from his arrival in New York to the first sailing of ''Clermont''. British actor [[Richard Greene]] starred as Fulton with Brenda Joyce as Harriet Livingston. [[Alice Faye]] and [[Fred MacMurray]] played wharf friends who help Fulton overcome problems to realize his dream. 

A fictionalized account of Fulton's role was produced by [[BBC]] television during the 1960s. In the first serial, ''Triton'' (1961,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/2a0da136dd914fc181a70f256b441695|title=Triton: Part 2|website=BBC Genome|access-date=8 December 2018}}</ref> re-made in 1968), two British naval officers, Captain Belwether and Lieutenant Lamb, are involved in spying on Fulton while he is working for the French. In the sequel, ''Pegasus'' (1969), they are surprised to find themselves working with Fulton, played by Robert Cawdron. In the 1961 version, Fulton was played by [[Reed De Rouen]].

A Robert Fulton cartoon character appears in ''[[Casper the Friendly Ghost]]'' short film titled \"Red, White, and Boo.\"

Author [[James McGee (author)|James McGee]] used Fulton's experiments in early submarine warfare (against wooden warships) as a major plot element in his novel ''Ratcatcher''

''Invasion'', {{ISBN|9780340961155}}, the tenth novel in the \"Kydd\" naval warfare series by [[Julian Stockwin]], uses Fulton and his submarine as an important plot element.

Until 2016, [[Disney Springs]] at [[Walt Disney World]] had a restaurant named Fulton's Crab House with a building in the shape of a steamboat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-fultons-crabhouse-paddlefish-20160425-story.html|title=Fulton's Crab House at Disney Springs changing to Paddlefish|last=Arnold|first=Kyle|work=OrlandoSentinel.com|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-et-paddlefish-disney-springs-20170203-story.html|title=First Look: Paddlefish in Disney Springs|last=Delgado|first=Lauren|work=OrlandoSentinel.com|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==
This county was organized in 1844. It was first known as Richardville County. Its first name honored [[Jean Baptiste Richardville]], a chief of the [[Miami tribe|Miami]].<ref>{{cite news|title=A Look Back as We Move Forward |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/867261/history_of_howard_county_indiana/|newspaper=The Kokomo Tribune|date=March 28, 1999|page=58|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = August 16, 2014 }} {{Open access}}</ref> Richardville's name was ''[[Pe-che-wa]]'', which translates to “Wildcat”, hence [[Wildcat Creek (Indiana)|Wildcat Creek]].

{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |format=PDF|title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains five courts. Circuit Court, Superior Court I, Superior Court II Superior Court III and Superior Court IV. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be admitted to practice law in the State of Indiana. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals.

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]] Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government.

==Episodes==
<!-- Do not add any episode titles unless they are listed on official websites; sources such as Bulbapedia and other community driven sites are not considered '''reliable''' sources. Magazines also cannot be accepted, as only a select few have access to episode information before their official release date. Also, do not change the Japanese names to their English translations '''UNTIL''' they have finished airing in an English speaking nation in the English dub. Being just \"close\" to airing in English is not enough; they must actually air beforehand in whatever timezone is the country of the original English airing - in the U.S. in most cases, episodes generally air in the Saturday morning time slot starting 9:00 Am - 9:30 AM EST/EDT or on Saturday evening 6:00 pm - 6:30pm EST/EDT, although there can be unique time slots. To comply with WP:CRYSTAL, you must cite a source for future air dates - only remove the citation once the episode has actually aired in the United States, and the fact that there is \"usually\" a weekly airing schedule when Pokémon airs on Disney XD is also unreliable as other programs can be aired on the network in place of Pokémon's time slot, delaying new English episodes by a week. Also, do not re-add or remove hidden titles before the announcement date; do not used Wikia such as fake release date are not followed scheduled. Wikia is not an reliable sourced and provide the editor are not accepted. Please take to discussion first if you have objections, thank you. -->

Meanwhile, because Go had left behind his present to his parents, Satoshi and Pikachu come looking for Go, and after learning what happened volunteer to help.

| ShortSummary    = The Gangar that \"haunted\" the Sakuragi lab is back, and it's as mischievous as ever! Satoshi and Go resume their race to catch it, but it gets away. Go starts insinuating that Gangar might be back to curse Satoshi, and all of a sudden weird accidents start happening to Satoshi. Later, he literally runs into a Trainer whom Gangar (who's been hiding in Satoshi's shadow) recognizes as its former Trainer who had abandoned it. Satoshi intervenes when the enraged Gangar attacks its former Trainer, and Rocket-Dan (who've been watching from the sidelines) decides that they want Gangar for themselves.

| ShortSummary    = While battle-practicing with Satoshi and Pikachu, Hibanny is teased by Go's Hihidaruma into using a Fire-type move, but things don't go well. Hibanny is frustrated, and when Go seems unsympathetic Hibanny runs away. It manages to learn Sparks, but Go is too interested in catching Pokemon to notice. Chasing after a Pelipper, Go and Hibanny run into Rocket-Dan, who attack them using a Nyorobon and a Kamukame. Hibanny is quickly defeated when its Sparks move fails again, and Satoshi and Pikachu have to jump in, with Pikachu \"blasting off\" Rocket-Dan. When Go again seems unsympathetic, Hibanny runs away again and again runs into Rocket-Dan, who battle it again. This time, Go and Hibanny work as a team, causing Hibanny to evolve into Rabbifuto, whose new Sparks Kick move defeats Rocket-Dan. However, in the battle's aftermath, the relationship between Go and the former Hibanny may never be the same again.

That night at the Sakuragi Institute, the egg hatches to reveal a Riolu, who runs away and starts attacking wild Pokemon indiscriminately, including an Iwark that may be too strong for Riolu unless Satoshi and Pikachu can get there in time.

<!-- Do not add any episode titles unless they are listed on official websites; sources such as Bulbapedia and other community driven sites are not considered '''reliable''' sources. Magazines also cannot be accepted, as only a select few have access to episode information before their official release date. Also, do not change the Japanese names to their English translations '''UNTIL''' they have finished airing in an English speaking nation in the English dub. Being just \"close\" to airing in English is not enough; they must actually air beforehand in whatever timezone is the country of the original English airing - in the U.S. in most cases, episodes generally air in the Saturday morning time slot starting 9:00 Am - 9:30 AM EST/EDT or on Saturday evening 6:00 pm - 6:30pm EST/EDT, although there can be unique time slots. To comply with WP:CRYSTAL, you must cite a source for future air dates - only remove the citation once the episode has actually aired in the United States, and the fact that there is \"usually\" a weekly airing schedule when Pokémon airs on Disney XD is also unreliable as other programs can be aired on the network in place of Pokémon's time slot, delaying new English episodes by a week. Also, do not re-add or remove hidden titles before the announcement date; do not used Wikia such as fake release date are not followed scheduled. Wikia is not an reliable sourced and provide the editor are not accepted. Please take to discussion first if you have objections, thank you. -->

Chasing after a Pelipper, Go and Hibanny run into Rocket-Dan, who attack them using a Nyorobon and a Kamukame. Hibanny is quickly defeated when its Sparks move fails again, and Satoshi and Pikachu have to jump in, with Pikachu \"blasting off\" Rocket-Dan. When Go again seems unsympathetic, Hibanny runs away again and again runs into Rocket-Dan, who battle it again. This time, Go and Hibanny work as a team, causing Hibanny to evolve into Rabbifuto, whose new Sparks Kick move defeats Rocket-Dan. However, in the battle's aftermath, the relationship between Go and the former Hibanny may never be the same again.

<!-- Do not add any episode titles unless they are listed on official websites; sources such as Bulbapedia and other community driven sites are not considered '''reliable''' sources. Magazines also cannot be accepted, as only a select few have access to episode information before their official release date. Also, do not change the Japanese names to their English translations '''UNTIL''' they have finished airing in an English speaking nation in the English dub. Being just \"close\" to airing in English is not enough; they must actually air beforehand in whatever timezone is the country of the original English airing - in the U.S. in most cases, episodes generally air in the Saturday morning time slot starting 9:00 Am - 9:30 AM EST/EDT or on Saturday evening 6:00 pm - 6:30pm EST/EDT, although there can be unique time slots. To comply with WP:CRYSTAL, you must cite a source for future air dates - only remove the citation once the episode has actually aired in the United States, and the fact that there is \"usually\" a weekly airing schedule when Pokémon airs on Disney XD is also unreliable as other programs can be aired on the network in place of Pokémon's time slot, delaying new English episodes by a week. Also, do not re-add or remove hidden titles before the announcement date; do not used Wikia such as fake release date are not followed scheduled. Wikia is not an reliable sourced and provide the editor are not accepted. Please take to discussion first if you have objections, thank you. -->

This time, Go and Hibanny work as a team, causing Hibanny to evolve into Rabbifuto, whose new Sparks Kick move defeats Rocket-Dan. However, in the battle's aftermath, the relationship between Go and the former Hibanny may never be the same again.

<!-- Do not add any episode titles unless they are listed on official websites; sources such as Bulbapedia and other community driven sites are not considered '''reliable''' sources. Magazines also cannot be accepted, as only a select few have access to episode information before their official release date. Also, do not change the Japanese names to their English translations '''UNTIL''' they have finished airing in an English speaking nation in the English dub. Being just \"close\" to airing in English is not enough; they must actually air beforehand in whatever timezone is the country of the original English airing - in the U.S. in most cases, episodes generally air in the Saturday morning time slot starting 9:00 Am - 9:30 AM EST/EDT or on Saturday evening 6:00 pm - 6:30pm EST/EDT, although there can be unique time slots. To comply with WP:CRYSTAL, you must cite a source for future air dates - only remove the citation once the episode has actually aired in the United States, and the fact that there is \"usually\" a weekly airing schedule when Pokémon airs on Disney XD is also unreliable as other programs can be aired on the network in place of Pokémon's time slot, delaying new English episodes by a week. Also, do not re-add or remove hidden titles before the announcement date; do not used Wikia such as fake release date are not followed scheduled. Wikia is not an reliable sourced and provide the editor are not accepted. Please take to discussion first if you have objections, thank you. -->

| '''Large Prairie 4141''' is a [[GWR 5101 Class]] locomotive. Built in 1946 it is a medium-sized tank engine with a [[2-6-2]]T wheel arrangement and was designed for suburban and local passenger trains, often seen with GWR and BR suburban coaches. At time of purchase it had recently received a boiler certificate which would see it run for up to ten years, securing the position of steam when the two other residents' boiler tickets had expired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eorailway.co.uk/news/two-arrivals-destined-to-steam-onto-eor|title=Two Arrivals Destined to Steam onto EOR - Epping Ongar Railway - News|author=Paul Skinner|work=Epping Ongar Railway - News|access-date=19 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414091810/http://eorailway.co.uk/news/two-arrivals-destined-to-steam-onto-eor|archive-date=14 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Arrived at the Epping Ongar Railway in 2012, just in time for the \"Santa Specials\" in December 2012.

| [[British Rail Class 117|Class 117]]
|  The railway has the two driving cars from what was a three-car [[British Rail Class 117|Class 117 DMU]]. There were 127 of this type of vehicle and they were delivered new in 1959 to Southall depot working services between Paddington and the suburbs. They continued to be based in the London area until withdrawal in the 1990s, they arrived at the Railway in 2004. Each coach has two [[Leyland Motors|Leyland]] [[diesel engine]]s underneath, which drive the wheels mechanically through a [[fluid flywheel]]. The driver's cab at each end of the unit means it can be driven from either end, making it ideal when running to [[Coopersale]], and speeding up turn-around times. The windows in the ends mean passengers in either coach get an excellent view of the line ahead or behind and also get to watch the driver in action. The unit ran in an unusual dark blue and white 'EOR' livery until 2007, when it was taken out of service by the new owner when services were suspended. The interior has been refurbished, the unit is receiving attention to the exterior bodywork. DMBS is being restored; DMS is in service twinned with a Class 121 unpowered driving trailer.<ref>http://eorailway.co.uk/departments/rolling-stock/mus/{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

It has been brought back to the South East from the [[North Yorkshire Moors Railway]], and has been restored and again carries passengers. It is the usual motive power for the trains towards Epping. 205205 is the only unit with a corridor connection as it was experimentally converted and modernised by British Rail. The volunteer team at EOR has restored the unit, complete with its commuter-style interior and is now painted in former \"Network SouthEast\" livery. This ensures the preservation of this period of transport history and is attractive to film and TV companies who require a train of that era. It arrived at the Epping Ongar Railway in 2009. It is Out of Traffic - available as coaching stock.<ref>http://eorailway.co.uk/departments/rolling-stock/mus/{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==EMUs ==
Epping Ongar Railway has an affinity with [[electric multiple unit]] (EMU) preservation, as the branch used [[London Underground rolling stock|LT's electric stock]] from 1957 until 1994. There was talk of the line being electrified by the [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]] with overhead electrification before the [[Second World War]] intervened. Some local lines were electrified quite early on, for example to Shenfield and Southend, and the next generations of EMUs continue to work services on those lines into Liverpool Street.

While the 3rd & 4th conductor rails were removed by the new owners, the line still hosts electric style units, though without the electrification they are hauled by a [[diesel locomotive]]. Due to cost, safety issues and legislation it is not possible to re-electrify the branch.

The most iconic carriage design of the LNER, these lasted well into BR ownership. Finalised in 1923, the design utilised a 60&nbsp;ft underframe, with more traditional squared moulding and windows and wooden teak-panelled bodies. There are two examples on the EOR a Buffet car and Brake Tourist Open (BTO) examples..

| The buffet was built in 1936. After a short stay a Quainton Road, where it was used to serve refreshments, the carriage was then moved to Chappel and Wakes Colne in 1972. Restoration had, by this stage, been commenced, but was stalled as priority was given to a BTO (which later moved to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.) The Buffet was moved again in 2001 to the workshops at Ovington and where the coach finally received covered accommodation. The owner decided in 2010, that carriage would fit in well here, and after needing to vacate the site at Ovington, the ownership of carriage was transferred to Epping Ongar Railway Holdings Limited, on the understanding that, in due course, it would be restored to its former glory. The carriage arrived at North Weald in 2010. Stored awaitng Restoration.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eorailway.co.uk/departments/rolling-stock/coaches/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023105116/http://eorailway.co.uk/departments/rolling-stock/coaches/ |archive-date=23 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

| [[British Rail Class 117|Class 117]]
|  The railway has the two driving cars from what was a three-car [[British Rail Class 117|Class 117 DMU]]. There were 127 of this type of vehicle and they were delivered new in 1959 to Southall depot working services between Paddington and the suburbs. They continued to be based in the London area until withdrawal in the 1990s, they arrived at the Railway in 2004. Each coach has two [[Leyland Motors|Leyland]] [[diesel engine]]s underneath, which drive the wheels mechanically through a [[fluid flywheel]]. The driver's cab at each end of the unit means it can be driven from either end, making it ideal when running to [[Coopersale]], and speeding up turn-around times. The windows in the ends mean passengers in either coach get an excellent view of the line ahead or behind and also get to watch the driver in action. The unit ran in an unusual dark blue and white 'EOR' livery until 2007, when it was taken out of service by the new owner when services were suspended. The interior has been refurbished, the unit is receiving attention to the exterior bodywork. DMBS is being restored; DMS is in service twinned with a Class 121 unpowered driving trailer.<ref>http://eorailway.co.uk/departments/rolling-stock/mus/{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

| Unit 60110 and 60810 Set No 205205
| [[British Rail Class 205|Class 205]]
| The railway has a 2-car 1957 \"Hampshire\" [[British Rail Class 205|Class 205 DEMU]] 205205. It has been brought back to the South East from the [[North Yorkshire Moors Railway]], and has been restored and again carries passengers. It is the usual motive power for the trains towards Epping. 205205 is the only unit with a corridor connection as it was experimentally converted and modernised by British Rail. The volunteer team at EOR has restored the unit, complete with its commuter-style interior and is now painted in former \"Network SouthEast\" livery. This ensures the preservation of this period of transport history and is attractive to film and TV companies who require a train of that era. It arrived at the Epping Ongar Railway in 2009. It is Out of Traffic - available as coaching stock.<ref>http://eorailway.co.uk/departments/rolling-stock/mus/{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==EMUs ==
Epping Ongar Railway has an affinity with [[electric multiple unit]] (EMU) preservation, as the branch used [[London Underground rolling stock|LT's electric stock]] from 1957 until 1994. There was talk of the line being electrified by the [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]] with overhead electrification before the [[Second World War]] intervened. Some local lines were electrified quite early on, for example to Shenfield and Southend, and the next generations of EMUs continue to work services on those lines into Liverpool Street.

While the 3rd & 4th conductor rails were removed by the new owners, the line still hosts electric style units, though without the electrification they are hauled by a [[diesel locomotive]]. Due to cost, safety issues and legislation it is not possible to re-electrify the branch.

==Carriages==

===Gresley Carriages <ref>http://www.cs.vintagecarriagestrust.org/se/results.asp</ref>===
The most iconic carriage design of the LNER, these lasted well into BR ownership. Finalised in 1923, the design utilised a 60&nbsp;ft underframe, with more traditional squared moulding and windows and wooden teak-panelled bodies. There are two examples on the EOR a Buffet car and Brake Tourist Open (BTO) examples..

| The BTO, a six-bay open saloon, has seating for up to 48 passengers, and was built in 1938, it is believed to be the last surviving 6-bay Gresley coach built to diagram D196. Arrived at the Epping Ongar Railway in 2014.

| Buffet Car
| The buffet was built in 1936. After a short stay a Quainton Road, where it was used to serve refreshments, the carriage was then moved to Chappel and Wakes Colne in 1972. Restoration had, by this stage, been commenced, but was stalled as priority was given to a BTO (which later moved to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.) The Buffet was moved again in 2001 to the workshops at Ovington and where the coach finally received covered accommodation. The owner decided in 2010, that carriage would fit in well here, and after needing to vacate the site at Ovington, the ownership of carriage was transferred to Epping Ongar Railway Holdings Limited, on the understanding that, in due course, it would be restored to its former glory. The carriage arrived at North Weald in 2010. Stored awaitng Restoration.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eorailway.co.uk/departments/rolling-stock/coaches/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023105116/http://eorailway.co.uk/departments/rolling-stock/coaches/ |archive-date=23 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==
Spencer County was formed in 1818 from parts of [[Warrick County, Indiana|Warrick County]] and [[Perry County, Indiana|Perry County]]. It was named for Captain [[Spier Spencer]], killed at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] in 1811. He was also the namesake for [[Spencer, Indiana]], the county seat of [[Owen County, Indiana|Owen County]].<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R. S.

[[Abraham Lincoln]] lived in Spencer County from 1816 to 1830, between the ages of seven and twenty-one. Originally, the area his family settled in was in Perry County. His family moved to Illinois in 1830.  The [[Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial]] is located at the site of the Lincoln family farm.  In addition, the graves of his mother [[Nancy Lincoln]] and sister [[Sarah Lincoln Grigsby]] are located in Spencer County.

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

Spencer County is part of [[Indiana's 8th congressional district]] and is represented in [[United States Congress|Congress]] by [[USRepublican|Republican]] [[Larry Bucshon]].

Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

'''Westphalia''' ({{IPAc-en|w|ɛ|s|t|ˈ|f|eɪ|l|i|ə}}; {{lang-de|Westfalen}} {{IPA-de|vɛstˈfaːlən|}}; {{lang-nds|Westfalen}} {{IPA-nds|vεs(t)'fɔːln|}}) is a region of northwestern [[Germany]] and one of the three historic parts of the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. It has an area of 20,210&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (7,803&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi)<!-- {{subst:cvt|20,210|km2}} --> and 7.9 million inhabitants.

The region is almost identical with the [[Province of Westphalia]], which was a part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] from 1815 to 1918<ref name=\"Prussian Province 2\">[http://www.deutsche-schutzgebiete.de/provinz_westfalen.htm Deutsches Kaiserreich: Provinz Westfalen]</ref> and the [[Free State of Prussia]] from 1918 to 1946. In 1946, Westphalia merged with the Northern [[Rhine Province|Rhineland]], another former part of Prussia, to form the newly created state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. In 1947, the state with its two historic parts was joined by a third one: Lippe, a former [[Principality of Lippe|principality]] and [[Free State of Lippe|free state]].<ref name=\"1789 territories\">[http://www.lwl.org/LWL/Kultur/Westfalen_Regional/Gebiet_Identitaet/Territorien LWL: Die westfälischen Territorien 1789]</ref>

All of the seventeen [[Districts of Germany|districts]] and nine [[Independent city#Germany|independent cities]] of Westphalia and [[Lippe (district)|Lippe's only district]] are members of the [[North Rhine-Westphalia#Subdivisions|Westphalia-Lippe Regional Association]] ''([[:de:Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe|Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe]])''.<ref name=\"Westphalia-Lippe\">[http://www.lwl.org/LWL/Der_LWL/Der-LWL-im-Ueberblick/Westfalen-Lippe LWL: Die Region Westfalen-Lippe]</ref>

Previous to the formation of Westphalia as a province of Prussia and later state part of North Rhine-Westphalia, the term \"Westphalia\" was applied to different territories of different sizes such as a part of the ancient [[Duchy of Saxony]], the [[Duchy of Westphalia]] or the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]].<ref name=\"1789 territories\" /><ref name=\"Prussian Province 2\" />  The [[Westphalian language]], a variant of the [[German language]], spreads beyond Westphalia's borders into southwestern [[Lower Saxony]] and northwestern [[Hesse]].<ref name=\"dialects\">[https://www.lwl.org/LWL/Kultur/Westfalen_Regional/Gebiet_Identitaet/Mundarten/ LWL: Niederdeutsche Sprache – westfälische Mundarten]</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Sauerland.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sauerland]] mountainous landscape]]
[[File:Bauernhof Melle 2.jpg|thumb|left|Typical [[Low German house|Westphalian houses]]]]

===Landscapes===
Being a part of the [[North German Plain]], most of Westphalia's north is flat. In the south the German [[Central Uplands]] emerge. Westphalia is divided into the following landscapes.<ref name=\"Westphalia-Lippe\" />

'''Flat to hilly''' ''({{cvt|498|m}} and under):'' [[East Westphalia]], [[Münsterland]], eastern [[Ruhr|Ruhr Metropolitan Area]], [[Tecklenburg Land]], [[Hellweg Börde|Westphalian Hellweg]]

'''Hilly to mountainous''' ''(up to {{cvt|843|m}}):'' Westphalian part of the [[Sauerland]], [[Siegerland]], [[Wittgenstein Land|Wittgenstein]]

===Rivers===
Westphalia is roughly the region in between the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Weser]], located both north and south of the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] River. Other important rivers are the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] and the [[Lippe (river)|Lippe]].<ref>[https://www.lwl.org/LWL/Kultur/Westfalen_Regional/Naturraum/Natuerliche_Fliessgewaesser LWL: Gewässerbildung und Systeme der natürlichen Fließgewässer in Westfalen]</ref>

===Mountains===
{{see also|List of mountains and hills of North Rhine-Westphalia}}

The [[Langenberg (Rothaar)|Langenberg]] ({{cvt|843|m}}) and the [[Kahler Asten]] ({{cvt|842|m}}) in the Sauerland part of the [[Rothaar Mountains]] are Westphalia's and also North Rhine-Westphalia's highest mountains.

===Westphalia and Eastphalia===
The term \"Westphalia\" contrasts with the much less used term \"[[Eastphalia]]\", which roughly covers the southeastern part of the present-day state of [[Lower Saxony]], western [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and northern [[Thuringia]].<ref name=\"Part of Saxony\" /><ref>[http://www.rp-online.de/panorama/wissen/jeder-kennt-westfalen-gibt-es-auch-ostfalen-aid-1.1596440 RP online: Jeder kennt Westfalen — gibt es auch Ostfalen?]</ref>

===Division===
Westphalia is divided into three [[Regierungsbezirk|governmental districts]]. These are subdivided into further [[Districts of Germany|districts]] and [[Independent city#Germany|independent cities]].

All districts and independent cities of the governmental districts of [[Arnsberg (region)|Arnsberg]] and [[Münster (region)|Münster]] are considered to be a part of Westphalia as a historic region. The [[Lippe (district)|District of Lippe]] as successor of the [[Free State of Lippe]] in the [[Detmold (region)|Governmental District of Detmold]] is rather considered to be a separate historic region.

===Coat of arms===

====Current use====
The traditional symbol of Westphalia is the Westphalian Steed: a white horse on a red field. It is derived from the [[Saxon Steed]] in the coat of arms of the medieval [[Duchy of Saxony]] which most of today's Westphalia was part of. In official contexts the coat of arms of Westphalia is being used by the Westphalia-Lippe Regional Association,<ref name=\"Official Arms\">[http://www.lwl.org/lwl-download/datei-download2/Politik/satzungen/1031581787_0/Hauptsatzung_15.11.2007_mit_Anlagen.pdf Hauptsatzung des LWL]</ref> which represents these two historic parts of North Rhine-Westphalia.

The [[coat of arms of North Rhine-Westphalia]] uses the Westphalian Steed to represent Westphalia as one of its parts alongside the Lippish Rose representing Lippe and the [[Rhine]] River representing the Northern Rhineland.<ref>[https://www.landtag.nrw.de/portal/WWW/GB_II/II.1/OeA/60JAHRE/2707_Landeswappen.jsp Landtag NRW: Das Wappen des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen]</ref>

====Previous use====
[[Prussia]] already used the Westphalian Steed in the coat of arms of its [[Province of Westphalia]]. It also is a big part of Kisker Germany, the biggest county in Germany.

====Similar versions====
The [[coat of arms of Lower Saxony]] uses a different version of the Saxon Steed since the [[Lower Saxony|state]] also covers large parts of the Old Saxons' duchy.

===Flag===

====Current use====
The colors of Westphalia are white and red. The flag of the Westphalia-Lippe Regional Association uses these colors with the Westphalian coat of arms in its center.<ref name=\"Official Arms\" />

The [[flag of North Rhine-Westphalia]] is a combination of the Northern Rhineland's colors green/white and the Westphalian white/red.<ref>[http://www.mik.nrw.de/themen-aufgaben/verfassung-recht/hoheitszeichen/landesflagge.html MIK NRW: Landesflagge]</ref>

====Previous use====
The flag of the Prussian Province of Westphalia already displayed the colors white and red.

====Similar versions====
The [[flag of Lower Saxony]] shows the [[Flag of Germany|colors of Germany]] and the Saxon Steed.

===Anthem===
Composed in [[Iserlohn]] in 1886 by [[Emil Rittershaus]], the ''[[Westfalenlied]]'' is an unofficial anthem of Westphalia.

==Identity==
[[File:Dialekte in Nordrhein-Westfalen.PNG|thumb|340px|Dialects in North Rhine-Westphalia: [[Franconian languages|Franconian dialects]] in red, [[West Low German|West Low German dialects]] in blue.]]
[[File:Westphalian (German) ladies peasant costume.jpg|thumb|Westphalian (German) ladies peasant costume – illustration by Percy Anderson for Costume Fanciful, Historical and Theatrical, 1906.]]
While the Northern Rhineland, Westphalia and Lippe are different historic territories of today's [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], the old border between the former [[Rhine Province]] and the [[Province of Westphalia]] is also a language border. While in Westphalia and Lippe, people tend to speak [[West Low German|West Low German dialects]] and especially the [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] variant of the [[Low German language]], [[Central German]] and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] dialects are being spoken in the Northern Rhineland.<ref name=\"dialects\" /><ref>[http://www.lwl.org/komuna/pdf/mundartregionen_westfalens.pdf LWL: Mundartenregionen Westfalens]</ref>

These different regional identities are often being emphasized by different majorities of denomination between [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Lutheran Protestants]]. The different majorities date back to the days of the [[Kleinstaaterei|territorial fragmentation]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire (of the German Nation)]] which existed until 1806. The [[Münsterland]] and the region around [[Paderborn]] for instance are still mainly Catholic regions because of the former existence of the [[Prince-bishop|prince-bishoprics]] of [[Prince-Bishopric of Münster|Münster]] and [[Prince-Bishopric of Paderborn|Paderborn]]. The mainly Lutheran [[Lippe (district)|Lippe]] was even able to retain its independence as a small state within [[German Reich|Germany]] in the form of a [[Principality of Lippe|principality]] until 1918 and as a [[Free State of Lippe|free state]] until 1946. This continues to influence the identity of its people who often distinguish themselves from neighboring regions such as [[East Westphalia]].<ref name=\"1789 territories\" />

In addition to these historic, lingual and religious aspects, there are some regional differences in culture and mentality. That is why many of the citizens of North Rhine-Westphalia rather see themselves either as \"Rhinelanders\", \"Westphalians\" or \"Lippers\" rather than as \"North Rhine-Westphalians\".

==History==
{{see also|History of North Rhine-Westphalia|History of Germany}}
Westphalia is known for the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]] which ended the [[Thirty Years' War]], as the two treaties were signed in [[Münster]] and [[Osnabrück]].

It is one of the regions that were part of all [[Succession of states|incarnations]] of the [[History of Germany|German state]] since the [[Early Middle Ages]]: the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], the [[German Confederation]], the [[North German Confederation]], the [[German Empire]], the [[Weimar Republic]] and [[Nazi Germany|National Socialist Germany]]. After [[World War II]] it was a part of the [[Allied-occupied Germany|British occupation zone]] which merged with the American zone to become the [[Bizone]] in 1947 and again merged with the French zone to become the Trizone in 1948. The current [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] was founded on these territories making Westphalia a part of [[West Germany]]. It is a part of united Germany since 1990.

===Roman incursion===
Around 1 A.D. there were numerous incursions through Westphalia and perhaps even some permanent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] or Romanized settlements. The [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] took place near Osnabrück, which at this time was a place of settlement of the Westphalians, who were a part of the Germanic tribe of the [[Saxons]]. Some of the tribes who fought at this battle came from the area of Westphalia.<ref>[http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/portal/Internet/input_felder/langDatensatz_ebene4.php?urlID=850&url_tabelle=tab_websegmente LWL: Westfalen zur Zeit der Germanen und Römer]</ref><ref>[http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/portal/Internet/input_felder/langDatensatz_ebene4.php?urlID=28&url_tabelle=tab_websegmente LWL: Die Zeit der römischen Feldzüge in Germanien (12 v.-16 n. Chr.)]</ref>

===Charlemagne===
[[Charlemagne]] is thought to have spent considerable time in [[Paderborn]] and nearby parts. His [[Saxon Wars]] also partly took place in what is thought of as Westphalia today. Popular legends link his adversary [[Widukind]] to places near Detmold, Bielefeld, Lemgo, Osnabrück and other places in Westphalia. Widukind was buried in [[Enger]], which is also a subject of a legend.<ref name=\"Part of Saxony\" />

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Westfalia_locator_map_(1000).svg|thumb|right|Westphalia within Saxony circa 1000&nbsp;CE{{legend|#d40000|Westphalia}}{{legend|#FEFEE9|Other parts of Saxony}}{{legend|#F6E1B9|Rest of the [[German Kingdom]]}}]]
Along with [[Eastphalia]], [[Angria]] and [[Nordalbingia]], Westphalia ''(Westfalahi)'' was originally a district of the [[Duchy of Saxony]]. At the time, large portions of its territory in the north lay in what today is [[Lower Saxony]]. Following the deposition of the Saxon duke [[Henry the Lion]] in 1180 and the subsequent belittlement of the duchy, Westphalia was elevated to a duchy in its own right by Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Barbarossa]]. The [[Duchy of Westphalia]] comprised only a small area south of the [[Lippe (river)|Lippe River]].<ref name=\"Part of Saxony\" />

Modern Westphalia was a part of the [[Lower Rhenish–Westphalian Circle]] of the Holy Roman Empire, which comprised territories of [[Lower Lorraine]], [[Frisia]] and parts of the former [[Duchy of Saxony]].

===Early modern era===
[[File:Westfaelischer Friede in Muenster (Gerard Terborch 1648).jpg|thumb|left|Ratification of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648 in [[Münster]] by Gerard Terborch (1617–1681)]]
As a result of the [[Protestant Reformation]], there was no dominant religion in Westphalia. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Lutheranism]] were on a relatively equal footing. Lutheranism was strong in the eastern and northern parts with numerous free churches. Münster and especially Paderborn were considered to be Catholic. Osnabrück was divided almost equally between Catholicism and Protestantism.<ref name=\"Reformation\">[http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/portal/Internet/input_felder/langDatensatz_ebene4.php?urlID=32&url_tabelle=tab_websegmente LWL: Westfalen im konfessionellen Zeitalter]</ref>

Parts of Westphalia came under [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]n control during the 17th and 18th centuries, but most of it remained divided by duchies and other areas of feudal power. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648, signed in Münster and Osnabrück, ended the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The concept of nation-state sovereignty resulting from the treaty became known as \"[[Westphalian sovereignty]]\".<ref name=\"Reformation\" />

===Prussia===
{{see also|Province of Westphalia}}
[[File:Westphalia x3.svg|thumb|right|upright|Prussian Westphalia edged in red, the Kingdom of Westphalia edged in green with the territorial overlap of former [[Minden-Ravensberg]], pasted over today's borders with North Rhine-Westphalia in dark grey.]]<!-- [[File:Provinz Westfalen 1905.png|thumb|250px|The Prussian [[Province of Westphalia]] in 1905]] -->
After the defeat of the [[Prussian Army]] by the French at the [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt]], the [[Treaties of Tilsit|Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807 made the easternmost portion of today's Westphalia part of the [[First French Empire|French]] [[client state|client]] [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] until 1813. While this state shared its name with the historical region, it only contained a relatively small part of Westphalia, rather consisting of mostly [[Hesse|Hessian]] and [[Eastphalia]]n regions.<ref name=\"1770-1815\">[http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/portal/Internet/input_felder/langDatensatz_ebene4.php?urlID=34&url_tabelle=tab_websegmente LWL: Vom feudalen zum modernen Westfalen 1770-1815]</ref>

Following to the [[Congress of Vienna]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] received a large amount of territories in the Westphalian region and created the [[Province of Westphalia]] in 1815. After in 1816, the former [[Duchy of Westphalia]] and the counties of [[Wittgenstein Land|Wittgenstein]] and in 1851 the [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] of [[Lippstadt]] had joined the province, Westphalia had received its modern territorial shape.<ref name=\"1770-1815\" /><ref name=\"Prussian Province\" />

In 1816, the [[Regierungsbezirk|governmental districts]] of Arnsberg, Minden and Münster were created.<ref name=\"1770-1815\" /><ref name=\"Prussian Province\" />

===Modern Westphalia===
After [[World War II]] in 1946, the present state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] was created by the [[British occupation zone|British military government]] from the former Prussian Province of Westphalia and the northern half of the former Prussian [[Rhine Province]]. The old governmental districts of 1816 stayed in place. When in 1947 the former [[Free State of Lippe]] with its capital Detmold joined North Rhine-Westphalia, the \"Governmental District of Minden\" was enlarged by this territory and renamed \"Governmental District of Detmold\". In total, North Rhine-Westphalia is subdivided into five governmental districts ''([[Regierungsbezirk]]e)''. Westphalia today consists of the old governmental districts of [[Arnsberg (region)|Arnsberg]] and [[Münster (region)|Münster]] and of [[Detmold (region)|Detmold]] except of the [[Lippe|District of Lippe]] which is a separate historical region and state part of North Rhine-Westphalia. Inhabitants of the region call themselves Westphalians and their home region Westphalia even though there is no administrative division by that name.<ref name=\"post-WW2\" />

==Economy==
Westphalia is home to the headquarters of [[Westfalia|Westfalia-Werke]], the contractor that built the [[Volkswagen Westfalia Campers]].<ref>[http://www.westfalia-mobil.net/en/unternehmen/unternehmenshistorie.php Westfalia – Company history]</ref>

==In popular culture==
''[[Candide]]:'' The protagonist of [[Voltaire|Voltaire's]] novella of the same name, resides in Westphalia in the beginning of the story.

''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' – Series 4, Episode 3 – includes a sketch<ref>[http://www.ibras.dk/montypython/episode42.htm MPFC episode 42]: The Light Entertainment War (transcript)</ref> that discusses a questionable map showing a Basingstoke in Westphalia (as opposed to the better-known [[Basingstoke]] in south-central [[England]]).

'''Westphalia''' ({{IPAc-en|w|ɛ|s|t|ˈ|f|eɪ|l|i|ə}}; {{lang-de|Westfalen}} {{IPA-de|vɛstˈfaːlən|}}; {{lang-nds|Westfalen}} {{IPA-nds|vεs(t)'fɔːln|}}) is a region of northwestern [[Germany]] and one of the three historic parts of the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. It has an area of 20,210&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (7,803&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi)<!-- {{subst:cvt|20,210|km2}} --> and 7.9 million inhabitants.

The region is almost identical with the [[Province of Westphalia]], which was a part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] from 1815 to 1918<ref name=\"Prussian Province 2\">[http://www.deutsche-schutzgebiete.de/provinz_westfalen.htm Deutsches Kaiserreich: Provinz Westfalen]</ref> and the [[Free State of Prussia]] from 1918 to 1946. In 1946, Westphalia merged with the Northern [[Rhine Province|Rhineland]], another former part of Prussia, to form the newly created state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. In 1947, the state with its two historic parts was joined by a third one: Lippe, a former [[Principality of Lippe|principality]] and [[Free State of Lippe|free state]].<ref name=\"1789 territories\">[http://www.lwl.org/LWL/Kultur/Westfalen_Regional/Gebiet_Identitaet/Territorien LWL: Die westfälischen Territorien 1789]</ref>

All of the seventeen [[Districts of Germany|districts]] and nine [[Independent city#Germany|independent cities]] of Westphalia and [[Lippe (district)|Lippe's only district]] are members of the [[North Rhine-Westphalia#Subdivisions|Westphalia-Lippe Regional Association]] ''([[:de:Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe|Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe]])''.<ref name=\"Westphalia-Lippe\">[http://www.lwl.org/LWL/Der_LWL/Der-LWL-im-Ueberblick/Westfalen-Lippe LWL: Die Region Westfalen-Lippe]</ref>

Previous to the formation of Westphalia as a province of Prussia and later state part of North Rhine-Westphalia, the term \"Westphalia\" was applied to different territories of different sizes such as a part of the ancient [[Duchy of Saxony]], the [[Duchy of Westphalia]] or the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]].<ref name=\"1789 territories\" /><ref name=\"Prussian Province 2\" />  The [[Westphalian language]], a variant of the [[German language]], spreads beyond Westphalia's borders into southwestern [[Lower Saxony]] and northwestern [[Hesse]].<ref name=\"dialects\">[https://www.lwl.org/LWL/Kultur/Westfalen_Regional/Gebiet_Identitaet/Mundarten/ LWL: Niederdeutsche Sprache – westfälische Mundarten]</ref>

===Landscapes===
Being a part of the [[North German Plain]], most of Westphalia's north is flat. In the south the German [[Central Uplands]] emerge. Westphalia is divided into the following landscapes.<ref name=\"Westphalia-Lippe\" />

'''Flat to hilly''' ''({{cvt|498|m}} and under):'' [[East Westphalia]], [[Münsterland]], eastern [[Ruhr|Ruhr Metropolitan Area]], [[Tecklenburg Land]], [[Hellweg Börde|Westphalian Hellweg]]

'''Hilly to mountainous''' ''(up to {{cvt|843|m}}):'' Westphalian part of the [[Sauerland]], [[Siegerland]], [[Wittgenstein Land|Wittgenstein]]

===Rivers===
Westphalia is roughly the region in between the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Weser]], located both north and south of the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] River. Other important rivers are the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] and the [[Lippe (river)|Lippe]].<ref>[https://www.lwl.org/LWL/Kultur/Westfalen_Regional/Naturraum/Natuerliche_Fliessgewaesser LWL: Gewässerbildung und Systeme der natürlichen Fließgewässer in Westfalen]</ref>

===Mountains===
{{see also|List of mountains and hills of North Rhine-Westphalia}}

The [[Langenberg (Rothaar)|Langenberg]] ({{cvt|843|m}}) and the [[Kahler Asten]] ({{cvt|842|m}}) in the Sauerland part of the [[Rothaar Mountains]] are Westphalia's and also North Rhine-Westphalia's highest mountains.

===Westphalia and Eastphalia===
The term \"Westphalia\" contrasts with the much less used term \"[[Eastphalia]]\", which roughly covers the southeastern part of the present-day state of [[Lower Saxony]], western [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and northern [[Thuringia]].<ref name=\"Part of Saxony\" /><ref>[http://www.rp-online.de/panorama/wissen/jeder-kennt-westfalen-gibt-es-auch-ostfalen-aid-1.1596440 RP online: Jeder kennt Westfalen — gibt es auch Ostfalen?]</ref>

===Division===
Westphalia is divided into three [[Regierungsbezirk|governmental districts]]. These are subdivided into further [[Districts of Germany|districts]] and [[Independent city#Germany|independent cities]].

All districts and independent cities of the governmental districts of [[Arnsberg (region)|Arnsberg]] and [[Münster (region)|Münster]] are considered to be a part of Westphalia as a historic region. The [[Lippe (district)|District of Lippe]] as successor of the [[Free State of Lippe]] in the [[Detmold (region)|Governmental District of Detmold]] is rather considered to be a separate historic region.

===Coat of arms===

====Current use====
The traditional symbol of Westphalia is the Westphalian Steed: a white horse on a red field. It is derived from the [[Saxon Steed]] in the coat of arms of the medieval [[Duchy of Saxony]] which most of today's Westphalia was part of. In official contexts the coat of arms of Westphalia is being used by the Westphalia-Lippe Regional Association,<ref name=\"Official Arms\">[http://www.lwl.org/lwl-download/datei-download2/Politik/satzungen/1031581787_0/Hauptsatzung_15.11.2007_mit_Anlagen.pdf Hauptsatzung des LWL]</ref> which represents these two historic parts of North Rhine-Westphalia.

The [[coat of arms of North Rhine-Westphalia]] uses the Westphalian Steed to represent Westphalia as one of its parts alongside the Lippish Rose representing Lippe and the [[Rhine]] River representing the Northern Rhineland.<ref>[https://www.landtag.nrw.de/portal/WWW/GB_II/II.1/OeA/60JAHRE/2707_Landeswappen.jsp Landtag NRW: Das Wappen des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen]</ref>

====Previous use====
[[Prussia]] already used the Westphalian Steed in the coat of arms of its [[Province of Westphalia]]. It also is a big part of Kisker germany, the biggest county in germany

====Similar versions====
The [[coat of arms of Lower Saxony]] uses a different version of the Saxon Steed since the [[Lower Saxony|state]] also covers large parts of the Old Saxons' duchy.

===Flag===

====Current use====
The colors of Westphalia are white and red. The flag of the Westphalia-Lippe Regional Association uses these colors with the Westphalian coat of arms in its center.<ref name=\"Official Arms\" />

The [[flag of North Rhine-Westphalia]] is a combination of the Northern Rhineland's colors green/white and the Westphalian white/red.<ref>[http://www.mik.nrw.de/themen-aufgaben/verfassung-recht/hoheitszeichen/landesflagge.html MIK NRW: Landesflagge]</ref>

====Previous use====
The flag of the Prussian Province of Westphalia already displayed the colors white and red.

====Similar versions====
The [[flag of Lower Saxony]] shows the [[Flag of Germany|colors of Germany]] and the Saxon Steed.

===Anthem===
Composed in [[Iserlohn]] in 1886 by [[Emil Rittershaus]], the ''[[Westfalenlied]]'' is an unofficial anthem of Westphalia.

==Identity==
[[File:Dialekte in Nordrhein-Westfalen.PNG|thumb|340px|Dialects in North Rhine-Westphalia: [[Franconian languages|Franconian dialects]] in red, [[West Low German|West Low German dialects]] in blue.]]
[[File:Westphalian (German) ladies peasant costume.jpg|thumb|Westphalian (German) ladies peasant costume – illustration by Percy Anderson for Costume Fanciful, Historical and Theatrical, 1906.]]
While the Northern Rhineland, Westphalia and Lippe are different historic territories of today's [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], the old border between the former [[Rhine Province]] and the [[Province of Westphalia]] is also a language border. While in Westphalia and Lippe, people tend to speak [[West Low German|West Low German dialects]] and especially the [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] variant of the [[Low German language]], [[Central German]] and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] dialects are being spoken in the Northern Rhineland.<ref name=\"dialects\" /><ref>[http://www.lwl.org/komuna/pdf/mundartregionen_westfalens.pdf LWL: Mundartenregionen Westfalens]</ref>

These different regional identities are often being emphasized by different majorities of denomination between [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Lutheran Protestants]]. The different majorities date back to the days of the [[Kleinstaaterei|territorial fragmentation]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire (of the German Nation)]] which existed until 1806. The [[Münsterland]] and the region around [[Paderborn]] for instance are still mainly Catholic regions because of the former existence of the [[Prince-bishop|prince-bishoprics]] of [[Prince-Bishopric of Münster|Münster]] and [[Prince-Bishopric of Paderborn|Paderborn]]. The mainly Lutheran [[Lippe (district)|Lippe]] was even able to retain its independence as a small state within [[German Reich|Germany]] in the form of a [[Principality of Lippe|principality]] until 1918 and as a [[Free State of Lippe|free state]] until 1946. This continues to influence the identity of its people who often distinguish themselves from neighboring regions such as [[East Westphalia]].<ref name=\"1789 territories\" />

In addition to these historic, lingual and religious aspects, there are some regional differences in culture and mentality. That is why many of the citizens of North Rhine-Westphalia rather see themselves either as \"Rhinelanders\", \"Westphalians\" or \"Lippers\" rather than as \"North Rhine-Westphalians\".

==History==

Westphalia is known for the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]] which ended the [[Thirty Years' War]], as the two treaties were signed in [[Münster]] and [[Osnabrück]].

It is one of the regions that were part of all [[Succession of states|incarnations]] of the [[History of Germany|German state]] since the [[Early Middle Ages]]: the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], the [[German Confederation]], the [[North German Confederation]], the [[German Empire]], the [[Weimar Republic]] and [[Nazi Germany|National Socialist Germany]]. After [[World War II]] it was a part of the [[Allied-occupied Germany|British occupation zone]] which merged with the American zone to become the [[Bizone]] in 1947 and again merged with the French zone to become the Trizone in 1948. The current [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] was founded on these territories making Westphalia a part of [[West Germany]]. It is a part of united Germany since 1990.

===Roman incursion===
Around 1 A.D. there were numerous incursions through Westphalia and perhaps even some permanent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] or Romanized settlements. The [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] took place near Osnabrück, which at this time was a place of settlement of the Westphalians, who were a part of the Germanic tribe of the [[Saxons]]. Some of the tribes who fought at this battle came from the area of Westphalia.<ref>[http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/portal/Internet/input_felder/langDatensatz_ebene4.php?urlID=850&url_tabelle=tab_websegmente LWL: Westfalen zur Zeit der Germanen und Römer]</ref><ref>[http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/portal/Internet/input_felder/langDatensatz_ebene4.php?urlID=28&url_tabelle=tab_websegmente LWL: Die Zeit der römischen Feldzüge in Germanien (12 v.-16 n. Chr.)]</ref>

===Charlemagne===
[[Charlemagne]] is thought to have spent considerable time in [[Paderborn]] and nearby parts. His [[Saxon Wars]] also partly took place in what is thought of as Westphalia today. Popular legends link his adversary [[Widukind]] to places near Detmold, Bielefeld, Lemgo, Osnabrück and other places in Westphalia. Widukind was buried in [[Enger]], which is also a subject of a legend.<ref name=\"Part of Saxony\" />

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Westfalia_locator_map_(1000).svg|thumb|right|Westphalia within Saxony circa 1000&nbsp;CE{{legend|#d40000|Westphalia}}{{legend|#FEFEE9|Other parts of Saxony}}{{legend|#F6E1B9|Rest of the [[German Kingdom]]}}]]
Along with [[Eastphalia]], [[Angria]] and [[Nordalbingia]], Westphalia ''(Westfalahi)'' was originally a district of the [[Duchy of Saxony]]. At the time, large portions of its territory in the north lay in what today is [[Lower Saxony]]. Following the deposition of the Saxon duke [[Henry the Lion]] in 1180 and the subsequent belittlement of the duchy, Westphalia was elevated to a duchy in its own right by Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Barbarossa]]. The [[Duchy of Westphalia]] comprised only a small area south of the [[Lippe (river)|Lippe River]].<ref name=\"Part of Saxony\" />

Modern Westphalia was a part of the [[Lower Rhenish–Westphalian Circle]] of the Holy Roman Empire, which comprised territories of [[Lower Lorraine]], [[Frisia]] and parts of the former [[Duchy of Saxony]].

===Early modern era===
[[File:Westfaelischer Friede in Muenster (Gerard Terborch 1648).jpg|thumb|left|Ratification of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648 in [[Münster]] by Gerard Terborch (1617–1681)]]
As a result of the [[Protestant Reformation]], there was no dominant religion in Westphalia. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Lutheranism]] were on a relatively equal footing. Lutheranism was strong in the eastern and northern parts with numerous free churches. Münster and especially Paderborn were considered to be Catholic. Osnabrück was divided almost equally between Catholicism and Protestantism.<ref name=\"Reformation\">[http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/portal/Internet/input_felder/langDatensatz_ebene4.php?urlID=32&url_tabelle=tab_websegmente LWL: Westfalen im konfessionellen Zeitalter]</ref>

Parts of Westphalia came under [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]n control during the 17th and 18th centuries, but most of it remained divided by duchies and other areas of feudal power. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648, signed in Münster and Osnabrück, ended the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The concept of nation-state sovereignty resulting from the treaty became known as \"[[Westphalian sovereignty]]\".<ref name=\"Reformation\" />

===Prussia===
{{see also|Province of Westphalia}}
[[File:Westphalia x3.svg|thumb|right|upright|Prussian Westphalia edged in red, the Kingdom of Westphalia edged in green with the territorial overlap of former [[Minden-Ravensberg]], pasted over today's borders with North Rhine-Westphalia in dark grey.]]<!-- [[File:Provinz Westfalen 1905.png|thumb|250px|The Prussian [[Province of Westphalia]] in 1905]] -->
After the defeat of the [[Prussian Army]] by the French at the [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt]], the [[Treaties of Tilsit|Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807 made the easternmost portion of today's Westphalia part of the [[First French Empire|French]] [[client state|client]] [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] until 1813. While this state shared its name with the historical region, it only contained a relatively small part of Westphalia, rather consisting of mostly [[Hesse|Hessian]] and [[Eastphalia]]n regions.<ref name=\"1770-1815\">[http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/portal/Internet/input_felder/langDatensatz_ebene4.php?urlID=34&url_tabelle=tab_websegmente LWL: Vom feudalen zum modernen Westfalen 1770-1815]</ref>

Following to the [[Congress of Vienna]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] received a large amount of territories in the Westphalian region and created the [[Province of Westphalia]] in 1815. After in 1816, the former [[Duchy of Westphalia]] and the counties of [[Wittgenstein Land|Wittgenstein]] and in 1851 the [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] of [[Lippstadt]] had joined the province, Westphalia had received its modern territorial shape.<ref name=\"1770-1815\" /><ref name=\"Prussian Province\" />

In 1816, the [[Regierungsbezirk|governmental districts]] of Arnsberg, Minden and Münster were created.<ref name=\"1770-1815\" /><ref name=\"Prussian Province\" />

===Modern Westphalia===
After [[World War II]] in 1946, the present state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] was created by the [[British occupation zone|British military government]] from the former Prussian Province of Westphalia and the northern half of the former Prussian [[Rhine Province]]. The old governmental districts of 1816 stayed in place. When in 1947 the former [[Free State of Lippe]] with its capital Detmold joined North Rhine-Westphalia, the \"Governmental District of Minden\" was enlarged by this territory and renamed \"Governmental District of Detmold\". In total, North Rhine-Westphalia is subdivided into five governmental districts ''([[Regierungsbezirk]]e)''. Westphalia today consists of the old governmental districts of [[Arnsberg (region)|Arnsberg]] and [[Münster (region)|Münster]] and of [[Detmold (region)|Detmold]] except of the [[Lippe|District of Lippe]] which is a separate historical region and state part of North Rhine-Westphalia. Inhabitants of the region call themselves Westphalians and their home region Westphalia even though there is no administrative division by that name.<ref name=\"post-WW2\" />

==Economy==
Westphalia is home to the headquarters of [[Westfalia|Westfalia-Werke]], the contractor that built the [[Volkswagen Westfalia Campers]].<ref>[http://www.westfalia-mobil.net/en/unternehmen/unternehmenshistorie.php Westfalia – Company history]</ref>

==In popular culture==
''[[Candide]]:'' The protagonist of [[Voltaire|Voltaire's]] novella of the same name, resides in Westphalia in the beginning of the story.

''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' – Series 4, Episode 3 – includes a sketch<ref>[http://www.ibras.dk/montypython/episode42.htm MPFC episode 42]: The Light Entertainment War (transcript)</ref> that discusses a questionable map showing a Basingstoke in Westphalia (as opposed to the better-known [[Basingstoke]] in south-central [[England]]).

'''COVID-19 apps''' are [[mobile app]]s designed to aid [[contact tracing]] with the intention of suppressing the infectious disease [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]. On 10 April 2020, the market leaders in mobile devices, [[Google]] and [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]], jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such apps directly into their [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] [[operating system]]s.

== Countries with official tracking apps ==
The Chinese government, in conjunction with [[Alipay]], has deployed an app across 200 Chinese cities.<ref>{{cite web |title=China's coronavirus detection app is reportedly sharing citizen data with police |last=Mehta |first=Ivan |date=2020-03-03 |work=The Next Web |language=en-us |url=https://thenextweb.com/china/2020/03/03/chinas-covid-19-app-reportedly-color-codes-people-and-shares-data-with-cops/ |access-date=2020-04-01 |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref>

In South Korea, the [[Corona 100m]] app has been developed to notify people of nearby cases.<ref>{{Cite news |title=South Korea took rapid, intrusive measures against Covid-19 – and they worked |date=2020-03-20 |last1=Dudden |first1=Alexis |last2=Marks |first2=Andrew |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/south-korea-rapid-intrusive-measures-covid-19 |access-date=2020-04-01 |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref>

In Singapore, an app called [[TraceTogether]] is being used.<ref>{{cite web |title=Use of surveillance to fight coronavirus raises concerns about government power after pandemic ends |last=Kharpal |first=Arjun |date=2020-03-26 |work=[[CNBC]] |language=en |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/coronavirus-surveillance-used-by-governments-to-fight-pandemic-privacy-concerns.html |access-date=2020-04-01 |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref>

Czechia has launched a Singapore-inspired tracking app called eRouška (eFacemask). The app was developed by local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government.<ref name=\"czechcrunch1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.czechcrunch.cz/2020/04/v-cesku-se-spousti-aplikace-erouska-stavi-na-ochrane-soukromi-a-upozorni-pokud-jste-prisli-do-kontaktu-s-nakazenym/ |title=V Česku se spouští aplikace eRouška.

North Macedonia launched the Bluetooth-based app „StopKorona!“ to  trace exposure with potentially infected persons and  provide a fast response to healthcare authorities. The app was developed and donated by a Macedonian IT company. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stop.koronavirus.gov.mk/|title=StopKorona! – tracing of Coronavirus exposure and protection from COVID-19|website=stop.koronavirus.gov.mk|language=mk|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>


== Countries considering deployment ==
In the United Kingdom, [[Matthew Gould]], chief executive of [[NHSX]], the government body responsible for policy regarding technology in the [[NHS]], said in late March 2020 that the organisation was looking seriously at an app that would alert people if they had recently been in contact with someone testing positive for the virus after scientists advising the government suggested it \"could play a critical role\" in limiting lockdowns.<ref>{{cite web |title=UK considers virus-tracing app to ease lockdown |last=Kelion |first=Leo |date=31 March 2020 |website=www.bbc.co.uk  |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52095331 |access-date=2020-04-01 |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref>

A similar app is planned in Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |title=HSE announces coronavirus contact-tracing app, but privacy concerns remain |last=Gorey |first=Colm |date=2020-03-30 |website=Silicon Republic |language=en |url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/enterprise/hse-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app |access-date=2020-04-01 |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref>

== Privacy concerns == 
Privacy campaigners have voiced their concern regarding the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, in particular about whether surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat has passed.<ref>{{cite news |title=The coronavirus is expanding the surveillance state. How will this play out? |last=Power |first=Ben |series=Analysis |date=27 March 2020 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |language=en |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/27/coronavirus-is-expanding-surveillance-state-how-will-this-play-out/ |access-date=2020-04-01 |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref>  [[Amnesty International]] and over 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/behind-global-efforts-make-privacy-first-coronavirus-tracking-app-n1177871 |title=Behind the global efforts to make a privacy-first coronavirus tracking app |last1=Ingram |first1=David |last2=Ward |first2=Jacob |date=2020-04-07 |work=[[NBC News]] |language=en |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> The German [[Chaos Computer Club]] (CCC)<ref>{{cite web |title=10 Prüfsteine für die Beurteilung von „Contact Tracing“-Apps |date=2020-04-06 |editor-first=Linus |editor-last=Neumann |editor-link=:de:Linus Neumann |language=de |publisher=[[Chaos Computer Club]] (CCC) |url=https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2020/contact-tracing-requirements |access-date=2020-04-11 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200411072407/https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2020/contact-tracing-requirements |archive-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> and [[Reporters Without Borders]] ({{lang|de|Reporter ohne Grenzen}}) (RSF)<ref>{{cite web |title=Corona-App in Deutschland - Anonymität und Quellenschutz gewährleisten |language=de |date=2020-04-06 |publisher=[[Reporter ohne Grenzen]] |url=https://www.reporter-ohne-grenzen.de/pressemitteilungen/meldung/anonymitaet-und-quellenschutz-gewaehrleisten/ |access-date=2020-04-11 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200411072450/https://www.reporter-ohne-grenzen.de/pressemitteilungen/meldung/anonymitaet-und-quellenschutz-gewaehrleisten/ |archive-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> issued checklists.

=== Centralized network-based location tracking ===
Some countries are using network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking. In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Holmes |first=Oliver |title=Israel to track mobile phones of suspected coronavirus cases |date=2020-03-17 |work=[[The Guardian]] |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/israel-to-track-mobile-phones-of-suspected-coronavirus-cases |access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> However, network-based solutions have significant potential privacy problems.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/report/aclu-white-paper-limits-location-tracking-epidemic |title=ACLU White Paper: The Limits of Location Tracking in an Epidemic |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |language=en |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

=== Privacy-preserving contact tracking ===
As of 7 April 2020, over a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using [[Bluetooth Low Energy]] (BLE) to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.<ref name=\":2\"/> Users then receive a message if they've been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.<ref name=\":2\"/>

A group of European researchers, including from the [[Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute]] and [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]], are under the umbrella of the [[Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing]] (PEPP-PT) project,<ref>{{cite web |title=Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing |url=https://www.pepp-pt.org/ |access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> developing a BLE-based app to serve this purpose that is designed to avoid the need for intrusive surveillance by the state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Europe shares code for new coronavirus warning app |last1=Delcker |first1=Janosch |last2=Brown |first2=Stephen |date=2020-04-01 |work=POLITICO |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-cracks-code-for-coronavirus-warning-app/ |access-date=2020-04-01 |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=In Germany, High Hopes For New COVID-19 Contact Tracing App That Protects Privacy |last=Schmitz |first=Rob |date=2020-04-02 |website=NPR.org |language=en |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/02/825860406/in-germany-high-hopes-for-new-covid-19-contact-tracing-app-that-protects-privacy |access-date=2020-04-07 |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=An EU coalition of techies is backing a ‘privacy-preserving’ standard for COVID-19 contacts tracing |author-first=Natasha |author-last=Lomas |date=2020-04-01 |work=[[TechCrunch]] |url=https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/an-eu-coalition-of-techies-is-backing-a-privacy-preserving-standard-for-covid-19-contacts-tracing/ |access-date=2020-04-11 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://archive.today/oOuLb |archive-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> However, PEPP-PT is a co-ordination effort which contains both centralised and decentralised approaches, and is not a single protocol.<ref>{{cite web|author=DP-3T |url=https://github.com/DP-3T/documents/blob/master/README.md |title=documents/README.md at master · DP-3T/documents · GitHub |publisher=Github.com |date= |accessdate=2020-04-13}}</ref>

In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching happens on-device.

The Privacy Group at [[MIT Media Lab]] has been developing SafePaths,<ref>{{cite web |title=SafePaths |date=2020-04-09 |url=http://safepaths.mit.edu/ |access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or path intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19. It is based on research from the whitepaper \"Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic\" released in March 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic |date=2020-03-17 |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08567.pdf |access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>

Centralised protocols, where a central server must be trusted with all or part of a social graph, are prevalent, such as Singapore's TraceTogether.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/opentrace-community |title=OpenTrace |last= |first= |date= |work= |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=}}</ref> Countries including Germany are reportedly preparing centralised protocols, although these have not yet been released.<ref name=\"Lomas_20200406\"/>

'''COVID-19 apps''' are [[mobile app]]s designed to aid [[contact tracing]] with the intention of suppressing the infectious disease [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]. On 10 April 2020, the market leaders in mobile devices, [[Google]] and [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]], jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such apps directly into their [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] [[operating system]]s.

== Countries with official tracking apps ==
The Chinese government, in conjunction with [[Alipay]], has deployed an app across 200 Chinese cities.<ref>{{cite web |title=China's coronavirus detection app is reportedly sharing citizen data with police |last=Mehta |first=Ivan |date=2020-03-03 |work=The Next Web |language=en-us |url=https://thenextweb.com/china/2020/03/03/chinas-covid-19-app-reportedly-color-codes-people-and-shares-data-with-cops/ |access-date=2020-04-01 |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref>

Czechia has launched a Singapore-inspired tracking app called eRouška (eFacemask). The app was developed by local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government.<ref name=\"czechcrunch1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.czechcrunch.cz/2020/04/v-cesku-se-spousti-aplikace-erouska-stavi-na-ochrane-soukromi-a-upozorni-pokud-jste-prisli-do-kontaktu-s-nakazenym/ |title=V Česku se spouští aplikace eRouška.

North Macedonia launched the Bluetooth based app „StopKorona!“ to  trace exposure with potentially infected persons and  provide a fast response to healthcare authorities. The app was developed and donated by a Macedonian IT company. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stop.koronavirus.gov.mk/|title=StopKorona! – tracing of Coronavirus exposure and protection from COVID-19|website=stop.koronavirus.gov.mk|language=mk|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>


== Countries considering deployment ==
In the United Kingdom, [[Matthew Gould]], chief executive of [[NHSX]], the government body responsible for policy regarding technology in the [[NHS]], said in late March 2020 that the organisation was looking seriously at an app that would alert people if they had recently been in contact with someone testing positive for the virus after scientists advising the government suggested it \"could play a critical role\" in limiting lockdowns.<ref>{{cite web |title=UK considers virus-tracing app to ease lockdown |last=Kelion |first=Leo |date=31 March 2020 |website=www.bbc.co.uk  |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52095331 |access-date=2020-04-01 |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref>

== Privacy concerns == 
Privacy campaigners have voiced their concern regarding the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, in particular about whether surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat has passed.<ref>{{cite news |title=The coronavirus is expanding the surveillance state.

=== Centralized network-based location tracking ===
Some countries are using network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking. In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Holmes |first=Oliver |title=Israel to track mobile phones of suspected coronavirus cases |date=2020-03-17 |work=[[The Guardian]] |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/israel-to-track-mobile-phones-of-suspected-coronavirus-cases |access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> However, network-based solutions have significant potential privacy problems.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/report/aclu-white-paper-limits-location-tracking-epidemic |title=ACLU White Paper: The Limits of Location Tracking in an Epidemic |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |language=en |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

=== Privacy-preserving contact tracking ===
As of 7 April 2020, over a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using [[Bluetooth Low Energy]] (BLE) to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.<ref name=\":2\"/> Users then receive a message if they've been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.<ref name=\":2\"/>

A group of European researchers, including from the [[Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute]] and [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]], are under the umbrella of the [[Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing]] (PEPP-PT) project,<ref>{{cite web |title=Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing |url=https://www.pepp-pt.org/ |access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> developing a BLE-based app to serve this purpose that is designed to avoid the need for intrusive surveillance by the state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Europe shares code for new coronavirus warning app |last1=Delcker |first1=Janosch |last2=Brown |first2=Stephen |date=2020-04-01 |work=POLITICO |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-cracks-code-for-coronavirus-warning-app/ |access-date=2020-04-01 |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=In Germany, High Hopes For New COVID-19 Contact Tracing App That Protects Privacy |last=Schmitz |first=Rob |date=2020-04-02 |website=NPR.org |language=en |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/02/825860406/in-germany-high-hopes-for-new-covid-19-contact-tracing-app-that-protects-privacy |access-date=2020-04-07 |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=An EU coalition of techies is backing a ‘privacy-preserving’ standard for COVID-19 contacts tracing |author-first=Natasha |author-last=Lomas |date=2020-04-01 |work=[[TechCrunch]] |url=https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/an-eu-coalition-of-techies-is-backing-a-privacy-preserving-standard-for-covid-19-contacts-tracing/ |access-date=2020-04-11 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://archive.today/oOuLb |archive-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> However, PEPP-PT is a co-ordination effort which contains both centralised and decentralised approaches, and is not a single protocol.<ref>{{cite web|author=DP-3T |url=https://github.com/DP-3T/documents/blob/master/README.md |title=documents/README.md at master · DP-3T/documents · GitHub |publisher=Github.com |date= |accessdate=2020-04-13}}</ref>

In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching happens on-device.

The Privacy Group at [[MIT Media Lab]] has been developing SafePaths,<ref>{{cite web |title=SafePaths |date=2020-04-09 |url=http://safepaths.mit.edu/ |access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or path intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19. It is based on research from the whitepaper \"Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic\" released in March 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic |date=2020-03-17 |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08567.pdf |access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>

==History==

===2012–2013: Early years and self-titled album===
Best friends since attending elementary school outside of Reykjavik, bandleader JJ Julius Son, drummer David Antonsson, and bassist Daniel Kristjansson began playing together at the age of 17 before adding guitarist Rubin Pollock to the mix in 2012. They named the band Kaleo, which means \"the sound\" in Hawaiian, and started their career with a handful of well-received shows at the 2012 Iceland Airwaves music festival, which was the band's first major public appearance.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |title=ABOUT KALEO |url=http://www.officialkaleo.com/about |website=officialkaleo.com |accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref>
Kaleo gained fame after covering the song \"Vor í Vaglaskógi\" which received heavy rotation on Icelandic state broadcaster [[RÚV]]'s radio station [[Rás 2]] and was featured on the station's top 10 list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=29314&ew_0_a_id=401466|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130718210016/http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=29314&ew_0_a_id=401466|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 July 2013|title=Top 10 in Iceland|first=Iceland|last=Review|date=10 July 2013|publisher=}}</ref> This song is also featured in the first episode of the TV series ''[[Trapped (Icelandic TV series)|Trapped]]''.
