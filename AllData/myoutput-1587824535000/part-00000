A preliminary version of the character also appears in the novel ''[[Go Set a Watchman]]'', written in the mid-1950s but not published until 2015. Atticus is a lawyer and resident of the fictional Maycomb County, Alabama, and the father of Jeremy \"Jem\" Finch and Jean Louise \"Scout\" Finch. Lee based the character on her own father, [[Amasa Coleman Lee]], an Alabama lawyer, who, like Atticus, represented black defendants in a highly publicized criminal trial.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=''Who was Atticus Finch?'' |work=Texas Bar Journal |volume=73 |issue=6 |first1=Talmage |last1=Boston |date=June 2010 |pages=484\u2013485 |url=http://www.texasbar.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Texas_Bar_Journal&Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=9585 |format=PDF |access-date=2013-02-05}}</ref> ''[[Book (magazine)|Book]]'' magazine's list of ''The 100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900'' names Finch as the seventh best fictional character of 20th-century literature.<ref name=infoplease>{{Cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0932846.html |title=''Book Magazine's'' The 100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900 |publisher=InfoPlease.com |access-date=2010-05-21}}</ref><ref name=NPR>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/totn/features/2002/mar/020319.chohdsfsdhfaracters.html |title=100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900 |author=''Book'' Magazine, March/April 2002 |date=March 2002 |work=Talk of the Nation |publisher=[[NPR]] |access-date=November 17, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> In 2003, the [[American Film Institute]] voted Atticus Finch, as portrayed in an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]]-winning performance by [[Gregory Peck]] in the [[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|1962 film adaptation]], as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains|greatest hero of all American cinema]].<ref name=AFI_greatest_hero>{{Cite web|url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246 |title=AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains |publisher=afi.com |access-date=2010-05-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807135547/http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246 |archivedate=August 7, 2011 |df=mdy}}</ref> In the 2018 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[To Kill a Mockingbird (2018 play)|stage play]] adapted by [[Aaron Sorkin]], Finch is portrayed by various actors including [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Ed Harris]], [[Greg Kinnear]], [[Rhys Ifans]] and [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]].\n\n== Effect on the legal profession ==\nClaudia Durst Johnson has commented about critiques of the novel, saying, \"A greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals\".<ref>Johnson, ''Boundaries'' pp. 25\u201327</ref> Alice Petry remarked, \"Atticus has become something of a [[folk hero]] in legal circles and is treated almost as if he were an actual person\".<ref>Petry, p. xxiii</ref> Examples of Atticus Finch's impact on the legal profession are plentiful.

In a letter to the author, Harper Lee herself noted the \"obvious parallels\" between the cases (Lee was 12 at the time of the Charles White trial) and between Atticus Finch and Foster Beck, though she also stated that she could not recall the trial, and that ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' was a work of fiction.<ref>Beck, ''My Father & Atticus Finch'', p. vii</ref>\n\nFormer President [[Barack Obama]] referenced Atticus Finch as an ideal American character.

His closing argument is a more polished version of the progressive argument the adult Jean Louise makes in ''Watchman'' and there are other instances where both versions contain the same descriptions word for word.<ref name=\"qz.com\" /> This kind of character development, where motivations and ideals between characters, for reasons of plot, are changed is not unusual in the process of creative writing.

This has proved controversial to many readers, unaware perhaps that although ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' was published first, ''Watchman'' is the first draft of the text that later became ''Mockingbird'' and the characterizations and key plot details between the two books are not only different but sometimes contradictory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/dark-days-in-maycombto-killa-mockingbird-1436564966 |title=Book Review: In Harper Lee's 'Go Set a Watchman' Atticus Finch Defends Jim Crow |last=Sacks |first=Sam |date=July 10, 2015 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of plot, Tom Robinson is acquitted in ''Watchman'' while in ''Mockingbird'' his unjust conviction as the result of prejudice was a central part of not only the story but why Atticus is seen culturally as such a righteous and progressive character. His defense is based on not just Robinson's innocence but on his fundamental equality. His closing argument is a more polished version of the progressive argument the adult Jean Louise makes in ''Watchman'' and there are other instances where both versions contain the same descriptions word for word.<ref name=\"qz.com\" /> This kind of character development, where motivations and ideals between characters, for reasons of plot, are changed is not unusual in the process of creative writing. Apart from the more progressive depiction of Atticus, the depiction of the town itself, especially the African-American characters, is also dramatically altered between the two drafts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/books/review-harper-lees-go-set-a-watchman-gives-atticus-finch-a-dark-side.html|title=Review: Harper Lee's 'Go Set a Watchman' Gives Atticus Finch a Dark Side|author=|date=July 10, 2015|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> Real-life comparisons with Lee's father, Amasa Coleman Lee, have also been made in the two differing versions of Atticus in that originally Amasa Lee was in favor of segregation but became more liberal later in life, later changing his views to those of Integration.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/07/13/memories-of-the-man-who-inspired-atticus-finch/ |title=Memories of the Man Who Inspired Atticus Finch |first=Laura |last=Stevens |date=July 13, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |access-date=July 21, 2015}}</ref>\n[[Tay Hohoff]], Lee's editor, has also been argued to have played a major part in the character development of the novel and particularly Atticus' liberal transformation. Jonathan Mahler of ''The New York Times'' notes in his article ''The Invisible Hand Behind Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird{{'}}''<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/books/the-invisible-hand-behind-harper-lees-to-kill-a-mockingbird.html |title=The Invisible Hand Behind Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' |date=July 12, 2015 |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Jonathan |last=Mahler |access-date=July 18, 2015}}</ref> that Ms. Hohoff, at the same time as she was guiding Ms. Lee through the ''Mockingbird'' re-write, was working on her own biography of the early-20th-century New York activist and humanist John Lovejoy Elliot. He notes that the book, ''A Ministry to Man'', was published in 1959, a year before ''Mockingbird.''<ref name=\"NYTimes\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*Beck, J. M.
