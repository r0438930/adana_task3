With one monarch on the two thrones there was ''de facto'' a \"regnal union\"; since James was very widely accepted in England the debate was not on that plane. A political union was more controversial: it is often referred to as a \"statutory union\", underlining the fact that the legal systems and institutions involved were different, and had had distinct historical paths. This wider union did not in fact come about in the 17th century (apart from the arrangements of the 1650s under the Commonwealth); but at the time of the [[Union of England and Scotland]] in 1707 arguments from this earlier period were again put into circulation.\n\nWhile the \"[[Union of the Crowns]]\" represented by James on his accession in England was essentially undisputed, the further political union, thought of as \"Union of the Kingdoms\" or \"statutory union\", was resisted. Legislation was produced, north and south of the border, by costive parliamentary debate, in the period 1604 to 1607, but it was limited in scope, mainly removing hostile laws. While at the same time jurists and religious figures supported a deeper union, the envisaged process stalled, and incompatibilities of the English and Scottish societies became more apparent.\n\n==Background==\nThe union of England and Scotland was anticipated by the [[Treaty of Greenwich]] of 1543, under which [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] was to marry the future [[Edward VI of England]]. This dynastic union did not take place, despite [[The Rough Wooing]]; but it produced a pro-union literature, notably in works written by the Scots [[John Elder (writer)|John Elder]] and [[James Henrisoun]], and the Englishmen [[William Patten (historian)|William Patten]] and [[Protector Somerset]].<ref>{{cite book|author=David Armitage|title=The Ideological Origins of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkuozOfNnKkC&pg=PA40|date=4 September 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78978-3|page=40}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Roger A.

Christophe de Harlay, comte de Beaumont, French ambassador in England, saw the proposed closer union as a negative in terms of France's interests; and more so when James brought the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|Anglo-Spanish War]] to an end in 1604. He cultivated good relations with a small group of prominent Scottish nobles who were committed to the French alliance. It had brought to Scotland some commercial advantages, and privileges for [[naturalisation]]. [[Henry Savile (Bible translator)|Henry Savile]] and others analysed the union in terms of its security threat.<ref>Galloway, pp. 58\u20139.</ref>\n\nThe political systems of the two countries, despite some superficial similarities of structure, were in fact rather different. The councils and parliaments functioned in different ways, and the Scottish system had been in transition for two decades. Scotland had a deserved reputation for prolonged internal instability, a point brought up in the English parliament by the xenophobic [[Christopher Pigott]] in 1607.<ref>Galloway, pp. 2\u20134.</ref>\n\nA full commercial and customs union was seen as against English interests; and Savile mentioned that Scotland would retain trading advantages with France. The Scottish economy was less well developed, its merchant ships smaller, and the existing trade between the two countries was not very extensive. [[Free trade]], it was argued, would mostly benefit the Scots.<ref>Galloway, p. 6\u20137 and 43\u20134.</ref>\n\nIn religious terms, it was clear that full union would cement a Protestant alliance. This was a powerful argument in its favour, for many. But the churches of England and Scotland were not identical, in organisation and ceremony. There was a tension noticed at the time, between declaring the points of difference [[adiaphora]], and advocating for [[religious uniformity]]. In this context, [[Robert Pont]] pointed up the use of the term [[Puritan]] as pejorative in England.<ref name=\"Ferrell1998\">{{cite book|author=Lori Ferrell|title=Government by Polemic: James I, the King?s Preachers, and the Rhetorics of Conformity, 1603\u20131625|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKdFBR9E_ZoC&pg=PA51|accessdate=7 November 2012|date=1 August 1998|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-3221-5|pages=31\u20132, 48.}}</ref>\n\n==Supporters of the union==\nSupporters were those who wanted to see a union that went further than the union of the two crowns, or \"regnal union\", that had been realised in the person of King James.

This timing tied it to the Scottish writer, [[Thomas the Rhymer]]. The use of \"Great Britain\" as a title of the kingdom as united by James was considered to reference [[Brutus of Troy]], of the Anglo-Welsh traditional [[foundation myth]].

With one monarch on the two thrones there was ''de facto'' a \"regnal union\"; since James was very widely accepted in England the debate was not on that plane. A political union was more controversial: it is often referred to as a \"statutory union\", underlining the fact that the legal systems and institutions involved were different, and had had distinct historical paths. This wider union did not in fact come about in the 17th century (apart from the arrangements of the 1650s under the Commonwealth); but at the time of the [[Union of England and Scotland]] in 1707 arguments from this earlier period were again put into circulation.\n\nWhile the \"[[Union of the Crowns]]\" represented by James on his accession in England was essentially undisputed, the further political union, thought of as \"Union of the Kingdoms\" or \"statutory union\", was resisted. Legislation was produced, north and south of the border, by costive parliamentary debate, in the period 1604 to 1607, but it was limited in scope, mainly removing hostile laws. While at the same time jurists and religious figures supported a deeper union, the envisaged process stalled, and incompatibilities of the English and Scottish societies became more apparent.\n\n==Background==\nThe union of England and Scotland was anticipated by the [[Treaty of Greenwich]] of 1543, under which [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] was to marry the future [[Edward VI of England]]. This dynastic union did not take place, despite [[The Rough Wooing]]; but it produced a pro-union literature, notably in works written by the Scots [[John Elder (writer)|John Elder]] and [[James Henrisoun]], and the Englishmen [[William Patten (historian)|William Patten]] and [[Protector Somerset]].<ref>{{cite book|author=David Armitage|title=The Ideological Origins of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkuozOfNnKkC&pg=PA40|date=4 September 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78978-3|page=40}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Roger A.

Christophe de Harlay, comte de Beaumont, French ambassador in England, saw the proposed closer union as a negative in terms of France's interests; and more so when James brought the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|Anglo-Spanish War]] to an end in 1604. He cultivated good relations with a small group of prominent Scottish nobles who were committed to the French alliance. It had brought to Scotland some commercial advantages, and privileges for [[naturalisation]]. [[Henry Savile (Bible translator)|Henry Savile]] and others analysed the union in terms of its security threat.<ref>Galloway, pp. 58\u20139.</ref>\n\nThe political systems of the two countries, despite some superficial similarities of structure, were in fact rather different. The councils and parliaments functioned in different ways, and the Scottish system had been in transition for two decades. Scotland had a deserved reputation for prolonged internal instability, a point brought up in the English parliament by the xenophobic [[Christopher Pigott]] in 1607.<ref>Galloway, pp. 2\u20134.</ref>\n\nA full commercial and customs union was seen as against English interests; and Savile mentioned that Scotland would retain trading advantages with France. The Scottish economy was less well developed, its merchant ships smaller, and the existing trade between the two countries was not very extensive. [[Free trade]], it was argued, would mostly benefit the Scots.<ref>Galloway, p. 6\u20137 and 43\u20134.</ref>\n\nIn religious terms, it was clear that full union would cement a Protestant alliance. This was a powerful argument in its favour, for many. But the churches of England and Scotland were not identical, in organisation and ceremony. There was a tension noticed at the time, between declaring the points of difference [[adiaphora]], and advocating for [[religious uniformity]]. In this context, [[Robert Pont]] pointed up the use of the term [[Puritan]] as pejorative in England.<ref name=\"Ferrell1998\">{{cite book|author=Lori Ferrell|title=Government by Polemic: James I, the King?s Preachers, and the Rhetorics of Conformity, 1603\u20131625|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKdFBR9E_ZoC&pg=PA51|accessdate=7 November 2012|date=1 August 1998|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-3221-5|pages=31\u20132, 48.}}</ref>\n\n==Supporters of the union==\nSupporters were those who wanted to see a union that went further than the union of the two crowns, or \"regnal union\", that had been realised in the person of King James.

The use of \"Great Britain\" as a title of the kingdom as united by James was considered to reference [[Brutus of Troy]], of the Anglo-Welsh traditional [[foundation myth]].
