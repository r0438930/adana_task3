According to folklore, there were many ways people could protect themselves during the days when the ''kallikantzaroi'' were loose. One such method was to leave a [[colander]] on their doorstep to trick the visiting ''kallikantzaros''. It was believed that since it could not count above two \u2013 three was believed to be a holy number, and by pronouncing it, the ''kallikantzaros'' would supposedly kill itself \u2013 the ''kallikantzaros'' would sit at the doorstep all night, counting each hole of the colander, until the sun rose and it was forced to hide.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAnother supposed method of protection from ''kallikantzaroi'' was to leave the fire burning in the fireplace, all night, so that they could not enter through it. In some areas,{{Where|date=November 2014}} people would burn the [[Yule log]] for the duration of the twelve days. In other areas, people would throw foul-smelling shoes into the fire, as the stench was believed to repel the ''kallikantzaroi'' and thus force them to stay away. Additional ways to keep them away included marking one's door with a black cross on Christmas Eve and burning incense.<ref name=\"Miles 2008, p. 245\">Miles 2008, p. 245.</ref>\n\nAccording to legend, any child born during the twelve days of Christmas was in danger of [[shapeshifting|transforming]] into a ''kallikantzaros'' during each Christmas season, starting with adulthood. It was believed that the antidote to prevent this transformation was to bind the baby in tresses of garlic or straw, or to singe the child's toenails. According to another legend, anyone born on a Saturday could see and talk with the ''kallikantzaroi''.<ref>\u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u1f00\u03c2 2005, p. 20.</ref>\n\nOne particularity that set the ''kallikantzaroi'' apart from other goblins or creatures in folklore was that they were said to appear on Earth for only twelve days each year.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Their short duration on Earth, as well as the fact that they were not considered purely malevolent creatures but rather impish and stupid, led to a number of theories about their creation. One such theory connects them to the masquerades of the ancient Roman winter festival of [[Bacchanalia]], and later the Greek [[Dionysia]].  During the drunken, orgiastic parts of the festivals, people wearing masks, hidden under costumes in bestial shapes yet still appearing humanoid, may have made an exceptional impression on the minds of simple folk who were intoxicated.<ref name=\"Miles 2008, p. 245\"/>\n\nIn Greek, the term ''kallikantzaros'' is also used to describe a number of other short, ugly and usually mischievous beings in folklore. When not used for the abovementioned creatures, it seems to express the collective sense for the Irish word [[leprechaun]] and the English words [[gnome]] and [[goblin]].{{Original research inline|date=November 2014}}\n\n==In Serbian folklore==\nIn [[Serbian Christmas traditions]], the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] were previously called the \"unbaptized days\" and were considered a time when demonic forces of all kinds were believed to be more active and dangerous than usual.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} People were cautious not to attract their attention, and did not go out late at night. The latter precaution was especially because of the mythical demons called ''karakond\u017eula'' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u045f\u0443\u043b\u0430}}; also ''karakond\u017ea /'' \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u045f\u0430, ''karakand\u017ea /'' \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043d\u045f\u0430 or ''karapand\u017ea /'' \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0430\u043d\u045f\u0430), imagined as heavy, squat, and ugly creatures. According to tradition, when a ''karakond\u017eula'' found someone outdoors during the night of an unbaptized day, it would jump on the person's back and demand to be carried wherever it wanted. This torture would end only when roosters announced the dawn; at that moment the creature would release its victim and run away.\n\nThe karakond\u017eula is also known to punish and torment people who commit adultery. Adulterers were known to sneak out of their homes while their significant other would sleep, and then visit the person they were cheating with, or prostitutes, or brothels. The karakond\u017eula would sit and wait on the top of the doorframe of the front door to the house and jump on the back of the adulterers and lash them with a stick or scratch or dig its sharp nails in the person back and neck and force them to run through nearby forests all night. Similarity to other accounts the karakond\u017eula would flee by the sight of first dawn.\n\nThis can be seen as a warning to would be adulterers to think carefully about their intentions, desires and understand the consequences that they would incur if they were to fulfill such actions. In this version of the myth the  karakond\u017eula would come back every night and remain on the door lintel until the adulterers confess their sins to their significant other<ref name=Vukovic>{{Cite book | last = Vukovi\u0107 | first = Milan T. | script-title=sr:\u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0458\u0438, \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0434 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430 |trans-title=Serbian folk customs, beliefs, and sayings | chapter = \u0411\u043e\u0436\u0438\u045b\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438\n | pages = 94 | location = Belgrade | publisher = Sazve\u017e\u0111a | edition = 12 | language = Serbian | year = 2004 | isbn = 86-83699-08-0}}</ref>\n\n==In Anatolian folklore==\nThe ''karankoncolos'' is a malevolent creature in Northeast [[Anatolia]]n Turkish folklore.

The Turkish name is derived from the Greek name.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} According to late Ottoman Turkish myth, they appear on the first ten days of ''Zemheri'' (\"the dreadful cold\") when they stand on murky corners, and ask seemingly ordinary questions to passers-by. The legend states that in order to escape harm, one should answer each question, using the word ''kara'' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]] for \"black\"), or risk being struck dead by the creature.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} It was also said in [[Turkish folklore]] that the ''karakoncolos'' could call people out during the cold ''Zemheri'' nights by imitating voices of loved ones. The victim of the ''karakoncolos''  risked freezing to death if he or she could not awake from the charm.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==In Bulgarian folklore==\nThe Bulgarian name of the demon is ''karakondjul'' (also romanized ''karakondjol'', ''karakondzul/karakond\u017eul''; {{lang-bg|\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043b}}) or ''karakondjo'' ({{lang-bg|\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0436\u043e}}).

It was believed that the antidote to prevent this transformation was to bind the baby in tresses of garlic or straw, or to singe the child's toenails. According to another legend, anyone born on a Saturday could see and talk with the ''kallikantzaroi''.<ref>\u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u1f00\u03c2 2005, p. 20.</ref>\n\nOne particularity that set the ''kallikantzaroi'' apart from other goblins or creatures in folklore was that they were said to appear on Earth for only twelve days each year.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Their short duration on Earth, as well as the fact that they were not considered purely malevolent creatures but rather impish and stupid, led to a number of theories about their creation. One such theory connects them to the masquerades of the ancient Roman winter festival of [[Bacchanalia]], and later the Greek [[Dionysia]].  During the drunken, orgiastic parts of the festivals, people wearing masks, hidden under costumes in bestial shapes yet still appearing humanoid, may have made an exceptional impression on the minds of simple folk who were intoxicated.<ref name=\"Miles 2008, p. 245\"/>\n\nIn Greek, the term ''kallikantzaros'' is also used to describe a number of other short, ugly and usually mischievous beings in folklore. When not used for the abovementioned creatures, it seems to express the collective sense for the Irish word [[leprechaun]] and the English words [[gnome]] and [[goblin]].{{Original research inline|date=November 2014}}\n\n==In Serbian folklore==\nIn [[Serbian Christmas traditions]], the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] were previously called the \"unbaptized days\" and were considered a time when demonic forces of all kinds were believed to be more active and dangerous than usual.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} People were cautious not to attract their attention, and did not go out late at night. The latter precaution was especially because of the mythical demons called ''karakond\u017eula'' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u045f\u0443\u043b\u0430}}; also ''karakond\u017ea /'' \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u045f\u0430, ''karakand\u017ea /'' \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043d\u045f\u0430 or ''karapand\u017ea /'' \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0430\u043d\u045f\u0430), imagined as heavy, squat, and ugly creatures. According to tradition, when a ''karakond\u017eula'' found someone outdoors during the night of an unbaptized day, it would jump on the person's back and demand to be carried wherever it wanted. This torture would end only when roosters announced the dawn; at that moment the creature would release its victim and run away.\n\nThe karakond\u017eula is also known to punish and torment people who commit adultery. Adulterers were known to sneak out of their homes while their significant other would sleep, and then visit the person they were cheating with, or prostitutes, or brothels. The karakond\u017eula would sit and wait on the top of the doorframe of the front door to the house and jump on the back of the adulterers and lash them with a stick or scratch or dig its sharp nails in the person back and neck and force them to run through nearby forests all night. Similarity to other accounts the karakond\u017eula would flee by the sight of first dawn.\n\nThis can be seen as a warning to would be adulterers to think carefully about their intentions, desires and understand the consequences that they would incur if they were to fulfill such actions. In this version of the myth the  karakond\u017eula would come back every night and remain on the door lintel until the adulterers confess their sins to their significant other<ref name=Vukovic>{{Cite book | last = Vukovi\u0107 | first = Milan T. | script-title=sr:\u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0458\u0438, \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0434 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430 |trans-title=Serbian folk customs, beliefs, and sayings | chapter = \u0411\u043e\u0436\u0438\u045b\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438\n | pages = 94 | location = Belgrade | publisher = Sazve\u017e\u0111a | edition = 12 | language = Serbian | year = 2004 | isbn = 86-83699-08-0}}</ref>\n\n==In Anatolian folklore==\nThe ''karankoncolos'' is a malevolent creature in Northeast [[Anatolia]]n Turkish folklore.

The Turkish name is derived from the Greek name.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} According to late Ottoman Turkish myth, they appear on the first ten days of ''Zemheri'' (\"the dreadful cold\") when they stand on murky corners, and ask seemingly ordinary questions to passers-by. The legend states that in order to escape harm, one should answer each question, using the word ''kara'' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]] for \"black\"), or risk being struck dead by the creature.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} It was also said in [[Turkish folklore]] that the ''karakoncolos'' could call people out during the cold ''Zemheri'' nights by imitating voices of loved ones. The victim of the ''karakoncolos''  risked freezing to death if he or she could not awake from the charm.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==In Bulgarian folklore==\nThe Bulgarian name of the demon is ''karakondjul'' (also romanized ''karakondjol'', ''karakondzul/karakond\u017eul''; {{lang-bg|\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043b}}) or ''karakondjo'' ({{lang-bg|\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0436\u043e}}).
