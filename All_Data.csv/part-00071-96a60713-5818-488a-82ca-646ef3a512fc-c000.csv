''[[Evening's Empire]]'', set on the Oregon coast, concerns a bereaved opera composer drawn to the small town of Evening, and to mysteries that accord strangely with his current project, an adaptation of ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]''.

Real-life composers figure heavily in Herter's [[First Czechoslovak Republic|First Republic]] trilogy (comprising ''[[On the Overgrown Path]]'' (2006), ''[[The Luminous Depths]]'' (2008) and ''[[One Who Disappeared]]'').  Set in interbellum Czechoslovakia, the trilogy stars [[Leoš Janáček]], [[Pavel Haas]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]], as well as the writer [[Karel Čapek]] and his artist-brother [[Josef Čapek]].  The narrative employs modes of science fiction, fantasy and horror found in the works of Čapek and [[Franz Kafka]], among others, and weaves a story that crosses and recrosses the fault lines of the short-lived Czechoslovak Republic.  Critic and author [[Brian Stableford]] says in his introduction to ''One Who Disappeared'', \"David Herter’s trilogy, to which ''One Who Disappeared'' provides a spectacular and moving conclusion, does not fall; on the contrary, it remains perfectly suspended, sturdy and elegant—and by virtue of its topography, it does not, like more myopic literary projects, taper off into soothing closure, but opens wide to an even vaster and more glorious universe of possibility.\"
 
''[[October Dark]]'', published in 2010, is a fantasia on [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (novel)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'' set in 1977 and 1931.  It tells a secret history of the fantastic film, centering on special-effects wizard [[Willis O'Brien]]'s 1931 encounter with a magician whose career stretches back to the birth of the [[phantasmagoria]] in Post-Revolutionary France.

In 2012, Herter published e-book versions of ''[[Ceres Storm]]'', ''On the Overgrown Path'', ''The Luminous Depths'', ''One Who Disappeared'' and ''October Dark'', and also published a novella related to ''[[Ceres Storm]]'' called ''The Firebirds of Theriak''.

Herter lives in [[Seattle, Washington]], where he attended the [[Clarion West]] writing workshop.

The '''Province of Prussia''' ({{Lang-de|Provinz Preußen}} ; {{lang-pl|Prowincja Prusy}} ; {{lang-csb|Prowincjô Prësë}}) was a [[Provinces of Prussia|province]] of [[Prussia]] from 1829 to 1878. Prussia was established as a province of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1829 from the provinces of [[East Prussia]] and [[West Prussia]], and was dissolved in 1878 when the merger was reversed.

[[Königsberg]] (present-day [[Kaliningrad]], [[Russia]]) was the provincial capital.

==History==
The Province of Prussia was created on April 13, 1824, as the easternmost [[Provinces of Prussia|province]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. The province was formed in a merger with the pre-existing provinces of [[East Prussia]] and [[West Prussia]] joined together in a [[personal union]], and from December 3, 1829, in a [[real union]]. 

Prussia's territory roughly corresponded to the historical region of [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]], from which the province and the kingdom derived their names, that had been divided by the [[History of Poland during the Jagiellonian dynasty|Kingdom of Poland]] since the [[Second Peace of Thorn]] in 1466. The region was divided into [[Ducal Prussia]], a [[fief]] of Poland, and [[Royal Prussia]], which was an integral part of Poland under direct rule. Ducal Prussia became part of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] in 1618, and became the Kingdom of Prussia upon the [[coronation]] of King [[Frederick I of Prussia]] in 1701. After the coronation, the term \"Province of Prussia\" was used as a designation for East Prussia to differentiate the territory of the former duchy within the larger kingdom. Royal Prussia was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772 during the [[First Partition of Poland]], placing the entirety of the Prussia region under Prussian rule. The following year, Prussia converted the former Royal Prussia and Ducal Prussia (including [[Warmia|Ermland]]) into the provinces of West Prussia and East Prussia, respectively, with minor border changes.

On April 1, 1878, the Province of Prussia was divided back into the provinces of West Prussia and East Prussia.

'''Robert Norman Bruce Lockhart''' (13 April 1920 – 20 February 2008), known as '''Robin''', was a British journalist, stock broker, and [[author]].

==Biography==
Bruce Lockhart was the only son of British spy [[R. H. Bruce Lockhart]] and was educated at Eagle House School and the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. During the [[World War II|Second World War]] he served in British naval intelligence, and was stationed in Singapore, where he met and married his first wife, Peggy in 1942.<ref>Thomas B. Allen, ''Declassified: 50 Top-Secret Documents That Changed History'' (Simon and Schuster, 2008) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-3iXDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT109 p. 109]</ref> After the War he pursued a career in journalism, working for the Beaverbrook Press in London, Manchester and Glasgow. He later became a stock broker, while continuing to pursue his literary interests. He lived in Sussex and France. 

''Ace of Spies'', Lockhart's book about the legendary secret agent [[Sidney Reilly]], was published in 1967, and [[Troy Kennedy Martin]] adapted it into the television serial ''[[Reilly: Ace of Spies]]'' (1983), starring [[Sam Neill]] as the title character, with [[Ian Charleson]] as his father. The book was republished in 1984 as ''[[Reilly: Ace of Spies]]''.

Bruce Lockhart converted to [[Roman Catholicism]]. His book about the [[Carthusian]]s, ''Half-way to Heaven'' (1985), came from his own experiences as a lay guest at [[St. Hugh's Charterhouse, Parkminster|St Hugh's Charterhouse, Parkminster]].<ref>Dennis D. Martin, ''Fifteenth-century Carthusian reform: the world of Nicholas Kempf'' (1992), p. 5</ref>

In 1995, he wrote a Preface to a new edition of his father's ''Scotch: The Whisky of Scotland in Fact and Story''. Lockhart was then living in [[Hove]], [[Sussex]]. He said he had done much fishing in [[Sutherland]], in the [[River Oykell]], [[Loch Stack]], and [[Loch Craggie]], and that after fishing he found that the local [[Glenmorangie distillery|Glenmorangie whisky]] brought \"a joyous, happy peace\". A great-great-grandfather had owned the [[Balmenach distillery]], and about 1980 he had himself served on a [[Which?|Consumers Association]] ''Which?'' panel, tasting [[malt whisky|malt whiskies]].<ref>Robin Bruce Lockhart, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9QS18Ul6sxcC&pg=PT7&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false Preface] to 7th edition of ''Scotch: The Whisky of Scotland in Fact and Story''</ref>  The ancestor in question was James McGregor, who in 1824 had taken out a license for a distillery he had been working illicitly.<ref>[https://scotchwhisky.com/whiskypedia/1817/balmenach/ BALMENACH HISTORY] at scotchwhisky.com</ref>

Lockhart was married three times and had one daughter by his first wife.

'''Robert Norman Bruce Lockhart''' (13 April 1920 – 20 February 2008), known as '''Robin''', was a British [[author]].

==Biography==
Bruce Lockhart was the only son of British spy [[R. H. Bruce Lockhart]] and was educated at Eagle House School and the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. During the [[World War II|Second World War]] he served in British naval intelligence, and was stationed in Singapore, where he met and married his first wife, Peggy in 1942.<ref>Thomas B. Allen, ''Declassified: 50 Top-Secret Documents That Changed History'' (Simon and Schuster, 2008) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-3iXDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT109 p. 109]</ref> After the War he pursued a career in journalism, working for the Beaverbrook Press in London, Manchester and Glasgow. He later became a stock broker, while continuing to pursue his literary interests. He lived in Sussex and France. 

''Ace of Spies'', Lockhart's book about the legendary secret agent [[Sidney Reilly]], was published in 1967, and [[Troy Kennedy Martin]] adapted it into the television serial ''[[Reilly: Ace of Spies]]'' (1983), starring [[Sam Neill]] as the title character, with [[Ian Charleson]] as his father. The book was republished in 1984 as ''[[Reilly: Ace of Spies]]''.

Bruce Lockhart converted to [[Roman Catholicism]]. His book about the [[Carthusian]]s, ''Half-way to Heaven'' (1985), came from his own experiences as a lay guest at [[St. Hugh's Charterhouse, Parkminster|St Hugh's Charterhouse, Parkminster]].<ref>Dennis D. Martin, ''Fifteenth-century Carthusian reform: the world of Nicholas Kempf'' (1992), p. 5</ref>

In 1995, he wrote a Preface to a new edition of his father's ''Scotch: The Whisky of Scotland in Fact and Story''. Lockhart was then living in [[Hove]], [[Sussex]]. He said he had done much fishing in [[Sutherland]], in the [[River Oykell]], [[Loch Stack]], and [[Loch Craggie]], and that after fishing he found that the local [[Glenmorangie distillery|Glenmorangie whisky]] brought \"a joyous, happy peace\". A great-great-grandfather had owned the [[Balmenach distillery]], and about 1980 he had himself served on a [[Which?|Consumers Association]] ''Which?'' panel, tasting [[malt whisky|malt whiskies]].<ref>Robin Bruce Lockhart, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9QS18Ul6sxcC&pg=PT7&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false Preface] to 7th edition of ''Scotch: The Whisky of Scotland in Fact and Story''</ref>  The ancestor in question was James McGregor, who in 1824 had taken out a license for a distillery he had been working illicitly.<ref>[https://scotchwhisky.com/whiskypedia/1817/balmenach/ BALMENACH HISTORY] at scotchwhisky.com</ref>

Lockhart was married three times and had one daughter by his first wife.

==Biography==
Bruce Lockhart was the only son of British spy [[R. H. Bruce Lockhart]] and was educated at Eagle House School and the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth.

The terrain of [[Chad]] in central [[Africa]] is dominated by the low-lying [[Chad Basin]] (elevation about 250 m / 820&nbsp;ft), which rises gradually to mountains and plateaus on the north, east, and south.

In the east heights of more than 900 metres (3,000&nbsp;ft) are attained in the [[Ennedi]] and [[Ouaddaï highlands|Ouaddaï]] plateaus. The greatest elevations are reached in the [[Tibesti Mountains]] in the north, with a maximum height of 3,415 metres (11,204&nbsp;ft) at Emi [[Koussi]]. The northern half of the republic lies in the [[Sahara]].

==Geology==
The geology of Chad includes an area of [[metamorphic rock]]s of [[Precambrian]] age surrounding the [[Lake Chad|Chad Basin]] which is floored with [[Tertiary]] and [[Quaternary]] [[sediment]]s. There are Precambrian rocks in the [[Tibesti]] Mountains in the north and the east whilst in eastern Chad are basement rocks, some of which extend into [[Darfur]] in neighbouring [[Sudan]].

[[granite|Granitic]] [[gneiss]] and [[pelite|pelitic]]-[[graphite|graphitic]] [[schist]]s are widespread. These are commonly cut by late orogenic granites and [[pegmatite]]s. Within the [[Kufra Basin]] in the northeast are lower [[Palaeozoic]] sandstones which are overlain by [[Nubian Sandstone]]s. There are also continental [[clastic]] rocks of lower [[Cretaceous]] age and rocks of marine origin from the Upper Cretaceous.

Within the Chad Basin, the Neogene [[Chad Formation]] is composed of [[lake|lacustrine]] sediments.<ref name=EIS/>

The terrain of [[Chad]] in central [[Africa]] is dominated by the low-lying [[Chad Basin]] (elevation about 250 m / 820&nbsp;ft), which rises gradually to mountains and plateaus on the north, east, and south.

In the [[east]] heights of more than 900 metres (3,000&nbsp;ft) are attained in the [[Ennedi]] and [[Ouaddaï highlands|Ouaddaï]] plateaus. The greatest [[elevation]]s are reached in the [[Tibesti Mountains]] in the north, with a maximum height of 3,415 metres (11,204&nbsp;ft) at Emi [[Koussi]]. The northern half of the republic lies in the [[Sahara]]. The [[Bodélé Depression]] is a low region in the southern Sahara that is surrounded by basalt mountain ridges.<ref name=\"eureka\"/> Winds flow through this region and lift dust. The dust from this region supplies over half of the dust to [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] rainforests.<ref name=\"eureka\">{{cite web |url= http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-12/acft-dtg122806.php |title= Dust to gust |publisher= EurekAlert!, AAAS |date= 28 Dec 2006 |accessdate= 28 Dec 2012}}</ref>

==Geology==
The geology of Chad includes an area of [[metamorphic rock]]s of [[Precambrian]] age surrounding the [[Lake Chad|Chad Basin]] which is floored with [[Tertiary]] and [[Quaternary]] [[sediment]]s. There are Precambrian rocks in the [[Tibesti]] Mountains in the north and the east whilst in eastern Chad are basement rocks, some of which extend into [[Darfur]] in neighbouring [[Sudan]].

[[granite|Granitic]] [[gneiss]] and [[pelite|pelitic]]-[[graphite|graphitic]] [[schist]]s are widespread. These are commonly cut by late orogenic granites and [[pegmatite]]s. Within the [[Kufra Basin]] in the northeast are lower [[Palaeozoic]] sandstones which are overlain by [[Nubian Sandstone]]s. There are also continental [[clastic]] rocks of lower [[Cretaceous]] age and rocks of marine origin from the Upper Cretaceous.

Within the Chad Basin, the Neogene [[Chad Formation]] is composed of [[lake|lacustrine]] sediments.<ref name=EIS/>

'''Strecker's chorus frog''' (''Pseudacris streckeri'') is a [[species]] of [[nocturnal animal|nocturnal]] [[tree frog]] native to the south central [[United States]], from southern [[Kansas]], through [[Oklahoma]] and east to [[Arkansas]], the northwestern tip of [[Louisiana]] and south throughouth much of [[Texas]].

== Description ==
Strecker's chorus frogs can attain a size of approximately 1.5&nbsp;inches (about 3.5&nbsp;cm). They vary in color from light [[grey]], [[brown]] to [[green]] with darker longitudinal blotches, and a distinctive dark spot that runs underneath the eye. Their underside is typically [[white]] in color, with [[yellow]] or [[orange (colour)|orange]] around the groin region.

Whether this name refers to a species with two subspecies: Strecker's chorus frog, ''Pseudacris streckeri streckeri'' Wright & Wright, 1933 and Illinois chorus frog, ''Pseudacris streckeri illinoensis'' (Smith, 1951), or whether the [[Illinois chorus frog]] is split off as its own species is controversial.

'''''Freedom'' (IX-43)''', an [[unclassified miscellaneous vessel]], was the second ship of the [[United States Navy]] of that name. An auxiliary schooner, she was acquired by the Navy in 1940, and assigned to the [[United States Naval Academy]] where she served in a noncommissioned status through 1962.

==Ship History==

An Act of Congress of 6 June 1940 authorized the Secretary of the Navy to accept without expense to the Government the 88-foot 2-masted schooner FREEDOM and her equipment as a gift from her owner, Sterling Morton, to the Naval Academy. She had been designed by John G. Alden and built at Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The yacht was delivered to the Navy on 10 Sep 40 at the shipyard of [[Henry B. Nevins, Incorporated|Henry B. Nevins, Inc.]], [[City Island, Bronx]] and arrived at the Naval Academy two days later. On 24 Oct 40 CNO assigned her the class designation \"Unclassified\" and directed that her name be retained. On 8 Jan 41 SecNav approved the adoption by BuShips of the symbol IX, already in use in the Navy Filing Manual, for vessels designated \"Unclassified,\" and BuShips assigned her the hull designation IX-43. She proved to be an excellent boat for ocean cruising and for teaching midshipmen how to handle a large sailing rig. She was sold in 1968 following the investigation of the faltering sailing program at the Naval Academy by the Fales Committee in the mid-1960s. Purchased by the Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship in Annapolis, Md., she became the miscellaneous function (training) vessel FREEDOM and was still in service in 1972.

Secter released a second film in Canada, titled ''[[The Offering (film)|The Offering]]'' in 1966, and entered discussions with [[CBC Television]] to produce a drama series for the network. However, before that series was launched, he moved to New York City to pursue opportunities in the much larger American film and theatre industry.

→‎Gases:link redirects to itself,safe,Sir Trenzalore,"[[Image:Four nines fine gold.jpeg|thumb|upright|1 troy ounce of four nines fine gold (999.9)]]
'''Nines''' are an informal, [[logarithm]]ic notation for proportions very near to one, or equivalently percentages very near 100%. Their common uses including grading the purity of materials.

Put simply, \"nines\" are the number of consecutive nines in a [[percentage]] such as 99% (two nines) or a [[decimal fraction]] such as 0.999 (three nines). The number of nines of a proportion {{var|x}} is

<math>\\mathrm{nines} = -\\log_{10}(1-x)</math>

However, there are different conventions for stating a non-[[integer]] number of nines. 99.5% could be expressed as \"two nines five\" or 2.3 nines, as outlined below. A completely pure material ({{var|x}} = 1) would have [[0.999...|an infinite number of nines]].

==Precious metals==
Very fine precious metals such as [[platinum]], [[gold]] and [[silver]]. Based on the system of [[millesimal fineness]], a metal is said to be ''one nine'' or ''one nine fine'' if it is 900 fine, or 90% pure. A metal that is 990 fine is then described as ''two nines fine'' and one that is 999 fine is described as ''three nines fine''. Thus, nines are a [[logarithmic scale]] of purity for very fine precious metals. Similarly, percentages ending in a 5 have conventional names, traditionally the number of nines, then \"five\", so 999.5 fine (99.95% pure) is \"three nines five\", abbreviated 3N5.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McGachie |first1=Richard O. |last2=Bradley |first2=Anne Grace |title=Precious metals |journal=Precious metals |volume=4 |year=1981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOMYAAAAIAAJ&q=%22four+nines+five%22 |page=262}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=PVD for Microelectronics: Sputter Desposition to Semiconductor Manufacturing |year=1998 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hmvtBE_7i00C&pg=PA387&lpg=PA387&dq=%22four+nines+five%22 387]}}<!-- NOTE: reference has typo, writing 99.9995% as \"four-nines-five\" while it is actually *five* nines five. --></ref>

==Gases==
The nines scale is also sometimes used in describing the purity of bottled gases. The purity of gas is an indication of the amount of other gases it contains. A high purity refers to a low amount of other gases. Gases of higher purity are considered to be of better quality and are usually more expensive.

The purity of a gas is generally expressed as a grade prefixed with the letter N giving the  \"number of nines\" in the [[percentage]] or [[decimal fraction]].  For gasses, the number of nines is usually written after the letter N, rather than before it. An N2.0 gas is 99% pure, and 1% (by volume) impurities.  An N6.0 gas is 99.9999% (six nines) pure, with 1 [[part per million]] (1 ppm) impurities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Purity, Grades, and Concentration |url=http://www.boconline.co.uk/en/contact-and-support/technical-advice/speciality-products-advice/purity-grades-concentration/purity-grades.html |website=BOCOnline.co.uk |accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref>

Intermediate values are formed using the [[common logarithm]].  For example, a gas which is 99.97% pure would be described as N3.5, since log<sub>10</sub>(0.03%) = &minus;3.523.

Nines are used in a similar manner to describe [[High availability#Percentage_calculation|computer system availability]].

'''Nines''' are an informal, [[logarithm]]ic notation for proportions very near to one, or equivalently percentages very near 100%. Their common uses including grading the purity of materials.

Put simply, \"nines\" are the number of consecutive nines in a [[percentage]] such as 99% (two nines) or a [[decimal fraction]] such as 0.999 (three nines). The number of nines of a proportion {{var|x}} is

<math>\\mathrm{nines} = -\\log_{10}(1-x)</math>

However, there are different conventions for stating a non-[[integer]] number of nines. 99.5% could be expressed as \"two nines five\" or 2.3 nines, as outlined below. A completely pure material ({{var|x}} = 1) would have [[0.999...|an infinite number of nines]].

==Precious metals==
Very fine precious metals such as [[platinum]], [[gold]] and [[silver]]. Based on the system of [[millesimal fineness]], a metal is said to be ''one nine'' or ''one nine fine'' if it is 900 fine, or 90% pure. A metal that is 990 fine is then described as ''two nines fine'' and one that is 999 fine is described as ''three nines fine''. Thus, nines are a [[logarithmic scale]] of purity for very fine precious metals. Similarly, percentages ending in a 5 have conventional names, traditionally the number of nines, then \"five\", so 999.5 fine (99.95% pure) is \"three nines five\", abbreviated 3N5.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McGachie |first1=Richard O. |last2=Bradley |first2=Anne Grace |title=Precious metals |journal=Precious metals |volume=4 |year=1981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOMYAAAAIAAJ&q=%22four+nines+five%22 |page=262}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=PVD for Microelectronics: Sputter Desposition to Semiconductor Manufacturing |year=1998 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hmvtBE_7i00C&pg=PA387&lpg=PA387&dq=%22four+nines+five%22 387]}}<!-- NOTE: reference has typo, writing 99.9995% as \"four-nines-five\" while it is actually *five* nines five. --></ref>

The '''Nazas River''' is a [[river]] located in northern [[Mexico]], in territory of the states of [[Coahuila]] and [[Durango]]. It is part of the [[Endorheic basin|endorheic]] [[Bolsón de Mapimí]]. It is only {{convert|560|km|mi}} long, but irrigates an area of {{convert|71906|sqkm|sqmi}} in the middle of the desert. The Nazas is also nurtured by the San Juan, Ramos, Potreritos, del Oro, Nazas, Santiago, [[Tepehuanes River|Tepehuanes]] and Peñón Blanco rivers. The river starts at the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]]. The aboriginal title for this stream is ''Tlahualilo'', coming from the [[Nahuatl]] words ''tlalli'' meaning \"fertile land\" and ''ahualila'', meaning \"water for irrigation\".

==Etymology==
The Nazas took its name when the [[Spanish Empire|Spaniards]], during the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of Mexico]] in the early 1500s, saw the original inhabitants on the shore of the river fishing with some artifacts similar to baskets, whose Spanish name is 'nasa', for that reason it became known as the 'river of nazas'.

==Ecology==
The Nazas watershed contains considerable desertic habitat, outside of the immediate [[riparian zone]]. A large variety of flora and fauna populate the Nazas Basin, with a variety of succulent native plants. One of the widespread flora is the [[ocotillo]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2009</ref> A number of freshwater fishes are found in the Nazas River, including ''[[Notropis nazas]]''.<ref>Seth Eugene Meek. 1904</ref>

==Geography and economy==
The river acts as a geographic division between the cities of [[Gómez Palacio, Durango|Gómez Palacio]] in Durango and [[Torreón]] in Coahuila. The city of Torreón is named after a tower that was built in the area to monitor the water level of the Nazas from afar.<ref>[http://www.torreon.gob.mx/english/the_city/turism/alrededores/rionazas_english.php ''Torreon'']</ref>

The Nazas has served as one of the most important natural resources enabling development in the [[Comarca Lagunera|Laguna Region]] since the middle of the 19th century. All of its waters are locked in Francisco Zarco and Lázaro Cardenas dams, both located in Durango, which have significantly reduced the once mighty flow of the river. However, Coahuila receives an annual share by mutual agreement between the state governments. Indeed, on its course, the Nazas fills smaller water bodies like the Palmito dam (in Torreón) and the Santiaguillo lagoons. The river ends in the now-drained Mayrán Lagoon and the Caimán Lakes in the Tlahualilo region.

The river was an important shooting location for the film ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). In the celebrated scene where a bridge is dynamited, the Nazas stands in for the [[Rio Grande]].

There is an amateur annual [[kayak]] competition on the Nazas River between the cities of [[Rodeo, Durango|Rodeo]] and [[Lerdo, Durango|Lerdo]] in Durango.

The village has an approximate population of 1,700.

==History==
[[File:Zab 1.jpg|thumb|left|Former medieval stronghold]]
Skrwilno dates back to the [[Middle Ages]], when it was a Polish stronghold. The stronghold was probably built by first historic Polish ruler [[Mieszko I]] in the 10th century.<ref name=sk34>Stanisław Kostanecki, ''Odkrycie skarbu w Skrwilnie w pow. rypińskim'', \"Notatki Płockie\" 6/20, 1961, p. 34 (in Polish)</ref>

During the [[Deluge (history)|Swedish invasion of Poland]], in 1658, the Swedes murdered the local Polish priest Walerian Cząpski.<ref name=sk33>Kostanecki, p. 33</ref>
{{stack|[[File:Skrwilno, park dworski 1 (WLZ14).jpg|thumb|right|175px|Manok park]]}}
During the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupation of Poland]] ([[World War II]]), between October 15 and November 15, 1939, the Germans carried out mass executions of [[Poles]] from [[Rypin]], [[Wąbrzeźno]], [[Brodnica]] and Skrwilno in the village (see ''[[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation]]'').<ref>Maria Wardzyńska, ''Był rok 1939.

In 1961, a collection of gold and silver [[tableware]], jewelry and pearls from the 16th and 17th century, was found at the medieval stronghold.<ref>Kostanecki, p. 32</ref> Named the {{Interlanguage link multi|Skrwilno Treasure|pl|Skarb ze Skrwilna}}, it is considered one of the most valuable treasures found in Poland in the 20th century.
