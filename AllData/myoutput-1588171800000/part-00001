Because of this format, material from the first five seasons did not air, outside of their original run, until 2019 when [[MeTV]] acquired the rights to these earlier seasons and began airing them.

In 1959, she became a regular supporting cast member on the CBS-TV variety series ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]''. Departing the Moore Show in the spring of 1962, she pursued other projects in film,  Broadway productions, and headlining her own television specials.  Burnett signed a contract with CBS for 10 years which required her to do two guest appearances and a special a year. Within the first five years of this contract, she had the option to \"push the button\", a phrase the programming executives used,<ref>{{cite book |last= Burnett|first= Carol|date= 2016|title=  In Such Good Company: Eleven Years of Laughter, Mayhem, and Fun in the Sandbox|url= |location= New York City|publisher= Crown Archetype|page= 4|isbn= 978-1101904657|author-link= }}</ref> and be put on the air in 30 one-hour variety shows, [[pay-or-play]]. After discussion with her husband [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], in the last week of the fifth year of the contract, Burnett decided to call the head of CBS [[Michael Dann]] and exercise the clause. Dann, explaining that variety is a \"man's genre\", offered Burnett a sitcom called ''Here's Agnes''. Burnett had no interest in doing a sitcom, and because of the contract, CBS was obliged to give Burnett her own variety show.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Carol Burnett show cast 1977.JPG|thumb|230px|On the left, main cast members in 1967 (clockwise from the bottom): Burnett, Harvey Korman, Vicki Lawrence, and Lyle Waggoner, on the right, the 1977 cast: Burnett, Tim Conway, Lawrence, and Korman]]\nIn addition to Carol Burnett, the cast consisted of:\n*[[Vicki Lawrence]]\n*[[Harvey Korman]] (seasons 1\u201310)\n*[[Lyle Waggoner]] (seasons 1\u20137)\n*[[Tim Conway]] (seasons 9\u201311; frequent guest performer in seasons 1\u20138)\n*[[Dick Van Dyke]] (first half of season 11)\nComedic actor Harvey Korman had done many guest shots in TV sitcoms. From 1963 to 1967, he had been a semi-regular on the CBS variety series ''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''. When Kaye's program ended in the spring of 1967, Korman was immediately hired for ''The Carol Burnett Show''. \n\nAt this particular time, actor Lyle Waggoner had recently auditioned for the title role in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series [[Batman]] but was passed over in favor of [[Adam West]]. Shortly after, Waggoner auditioned for the Burnett show and was immediately hired.  He would sometimes play the handsome man for Burnett to fawn over. His participation on the series was somewhat modeled on [[Durward Kirby]]  of ''The Garry Moore Show'' as Waggoner also functioned as the show's announcer in addition to playing in sketches.\n\n[[File:Carol Burnett Vicki Lawrence Dinah Shore Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|left|Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, and guest star [[Dinah Shore]] in the 1976 ''[[Went with the Wind!]]'' sketch]]\nVicki Lawrence, a young singer from [[The Young Americans]] wrote a letter to Burnett when she was 17, remarking on their physical resemblance. This led to her audition and getting hired to play Burnett's kid sister in numerous \"Carol and Sis\" sketches.\n\n[[Jim Nabors]] was the guest star on every season premiere of the show. Burnett considered Nabors to be her annual good luck charm.\n\nIn addition, several notable actors were used in the comedy sketches in featured roles, especially in the first season, such as [[William Schallert]], [[Isabel Sanford]], and [[Reta Shaw]].\n\nThe popular variety show not only established Burnett as a television superstar, but it also made her regular supporting cast household names, with such sketches as \"[[As the Stomach Turns]]\", (a parody of ''[[As the World Turns]]'') and \"[[Went with the Wind!]]\" (a spoof of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''), \"Carol & Sis\", \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\", and \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" (which led to a [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie titled ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', as well as a spin-off television series titled ''[[Mama's Family]]''), \"Nora Desmond\" (Burnett's send-up of [[Gloria Swanson]]'s character [[Norma Desmond]] in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''), and \"Stella Toddler\". A frequent repeated segment was \"Kitchen Commercials\", in which cast members parodied TV commercials that drove a woman (Burnett) crazy. The long-running show was frequently nominated for [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] for best variety series and won three times.\n\nA favorite feature consisted of an unrehearsed question-and-answer segment with the audience in CBS Studio 33 (now [[Bob Barker]] Studio) lasting about three to four minutes at the start of most shows. Burnett stated that she borrowed the concept from Garry Moore, who did the same on his variety show, but never taped it.<ref>\"The Florence Henderson Show\" RLTV, 2009</ref> Burnett asked for the lights to be turned up (\"let's bump up the lights\") and then randomly picked audience members who raised their hands. Burnett often ad-libbed funny answers, but occasionally ended up as the straight (wo)man. For example:\n\n:Young woman: \"Have you ever taken acting lessons?\"\n:Carol: \"Yes, I have.\"\n:Young woman: \"Do you think it did any good?\"\n\nThe show was rehearsed each day until its two Friday tapings. Differently colored cue cards (black, blue, green, and red) were used for each major performer (\"Carol Burnett: Bump-Up the Lights\"). The second taping was fairly routine until Tim Conway came aboard as a guest star.\nAs a recurring guest star from the show's launch and later a regular cast member, Conway provided unrehearsed bits to sketches that became known to the staff as \"Conway's Capers\". Conway would play the first taping straight, but (if the sketch had played well in the first taping, and could be used) would ad-lib bizarre scenarios during the second. Some notable clips included Conway as a Nazi interrogator berating an American captive (Lyle Waggoner). Using a Hitler puppet and a pencil as a \"club\", Conway sang three verses of \"[[I've Been Working on the Railroad]]\" as Waggoner tried in vain to ignore him. Some, like the Hitler puppet, made it into the final broadcast; others, like a notably convoluted story about Siamese elephants joined at the trunk (ad-libbed during a 1977 \"Mama's Family\" sketch), were edited, the uncensored version only appearing years later on CBS specials. Conway's favorite victim was Harvey Korman, who often broke character reacting to Conway's zaniness, such as when Conway played a dentist misusing Novocain or the recurring role of [[The Oldest Man (character)|\"The Oldest Man\"]] \u2013 an elderly, shuffling, senile man who slowly rolled down stairways and fell prey to various mechanical mishaps (including an electric wheelchair and an automated dry-cleaning rack).\n\nThe show also became known for its closing theme song, written by Burnett's husband, with these lyrics:<ref>{{cite web| last=Bell| first=Warren| title=Have a Laugh and Sing a Song| url=http://old.nationalreview.com/bell/bell200511090809.asp| accessdate=August 19, 2011| date=November 9, 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> \n:I'm so glad we had this time together\n:Just to have a laugh or sing a song\n:Seems we just get started and before you know it\n:Comes the time we have to say, \"So long.\"\n\nAt the close of each episode, Burnett tugged her ear. This silent message was meant for her grandmother, who raised her, and meant she was thinking of her at that moment. After her grandmother's death, Burnett continued the tradition.\n\n==Broadcast==\nWhen ''The Carol Burnett Show'' made its network debut on CBS-TV in September 1967, it was scheduled on Monday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm opposite NBC\u2019s ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' and ABC\u2019s ''[[The Big Valley]]''. At the end of its first season and through the spring of 1971, it consistently ranked among the top-30 programs. (For the 1969\u201370 season, it posted its highest rating ever, ranking at number 13.) For season five, CBS moved the show to Wednesday nights at 8:00&nbsp;pm, where its chief competition was NBC\u2019s ''[[Adam-12]]'' and the ABC sitcoms ''[[Bewitched]]'' and ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]''. Despite the schedule change, the show continued to do well until the fall of 1972, when the ratings slipped. In December 1972, CBS again moved ''The Carol Burnett Show'' to Saturday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm (EST) where, for the next four years, it not only received solid ratings, but was also part of a powerhouse Saturday-night lineup of primetime shows that included ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', and ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''.\n\nIn the 1973\u201374 season, the \"Family\" sketches (with Burnett as Eunice, Korman as her husband Ed, and Lawrence as Eunice's mother) were introduced and the \"Carol and Sis\" segments were phased out. At the end of that season (the series' seventh), after having been with ''The Carol Burnett Show'' from the beginning, Lyle Waggoner left the series to pursue other acting opportunities. The following season, Waggoner's spot as a supporting regular remained vacant. Don Crichton, the lead male dancer on the show, began to inherit some of Waggoner's duties. Then in season nine, because of his many popular guest appearances on the series, Tim Conway was signed as a full-time regular, joining Korman and Lawrence.\n\n[[File:Tim Conway Carol Burnett Dick Van Dyke Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|150px|From left to right: Conway, Burnett, and Dick Van Dyke in the final season]]\nIn November, 1976, the series' tenth year, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' presented what would become one of its best-known and most well-regarded sketches: \"[[Went with the Wind!]],\" a parody of the 1939 film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', which had its television debut on NBC the week before. After the 1976-77 season ended, Harvey Korman decided to leave the series. After a decade of working with Burnett and winning several Emmy Awards, Korman had been offered a contract by ABC to headline his own series. Also, the ratings had begun to decline. Nevertheless, CBS renewed Burnett's show for an 11th season.\n\nDick Van Dyke, fresh from headlining his own short-lived Emmy-winning variety series, ''Van Dyke & Company'', was brought in to replace Korman. However, his presence did not help stem the sagging ratings, as the show faced new competition in ABC's ''[[The Love Boat]]''. After three months, Van Dyke departed the show, and CBS, in a desperate attempt to save the series, moved ''The Carol Burnett Show'' from Saturday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm to Sunday nights at the same hour, beginning in December 1977. Regular guest stars [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Ken Berry]] were brought in to fill the void left by Korman and Van Dyke. The ratings improved considerably.\n\nCBS wanted to renew the show for another year, but by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre, despite her success in it. With the changes in cast along with the mediocre ratings, she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out. Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later. Thus, on March 29, 1978, in a special two-hour finale entitled \"[[A Special Evening with Carol Burnett]]\", ''The Carol Burnett Show'' left primetime television after 11 years, finishing its last season in 66th place. Reruns were aired during the summer of 1978.\n\n==Notable characters/sketches==\n\n[[File:Carol Burnett charwoman character 1974.JPG|thumb|150px|Burnett as the Charwoman]]\n[[File:Carol Burnett Madeline Kahn Eunice Carol Burnett Show.JPG|thumb|150px|Burnett as Eunice with [[Madeline Kahn]] in \"The Family\" sketch]]\n\n*[[As the Stomach Turns]] \u2013 a [[soap opera]] parody taking place in the fictional town of Canoga Falls with Burnett as the main character Marian.\n*Carol and Sis \u2013 Burnett as Carol and Lawrence as her sister Chris with Korman as Carol's husband Roger;<ref name=\"Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004 1\">{{cite book| first= Wesley| last= Hyatt| year= 2006| title= Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004| edition=| publisher= McFarland & Company| location=| pages= 239| isbn= 978-0786423293}}</ref> the sketch was based on Burnett's life in New York raising her kid sister in New York with her first husband, and Lawrence was originally hired just for this sketch.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=9 January 2017}}</ref>\n*The Charwoman \u2013 Burnett's signature character, an unnamed [[charwoman]] (most often in a musical number),<ref name=\"Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004 2\">{{cite book| first= Wesley| last= Hyatt| year= 2006| title= Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004| edition=| publisher= McFarland & Company| location=| pages= 240| isbn= 978-0786423293}}</ref> whose animated image has been used in the opening credits, and also in the opening and closing credits of ''Carol Burnett and Friends''.\n*Chiquita \u2013 Burnett's parody of [[Charo]];

At that gathering, Burnett got wistful and started reminiscing about the show and making suggestions to Conway concerning sketches that she wished they could be creating if the show were still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series. Taking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979. CBS already had its schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea. However, ABC was interested, and as a result, four postscript episodes of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' were produced. Under the title ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'', the show premiered on Saturday, August 18, 1979, and included many favorite sketches such as \"Mr. Tudball and Mrs. Wiggins\", \"The Family\", \"As The Stomach Turns\", and Burnett doing her impersonation of Queen Elizabeth II. Its format was very much similar to Burnett's series, with two exceptions. Due to the unavailability of Harvey Korman (who, ironically, had been under contract to ABC since he had left Burnett's show in 1977), comic actors [[Kenneth Mars]] and [[Craig Richard Nelson]] were added to the supporting cast, joining Lawrence and Conway. [[Ernie Flatt]], who had been the choreographer on Burnett's show for its entire 11-year run, was replaced by the show's lead dancer Don Crichton. The guest stars in that four-week period were (chronologically) [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]], and [[Sally Field]]. The reviews of the series were very favorable, with several critics heartily welcoming Burnett back to weekly television, albeit on a limited basis. The ratings also were respectable and plans were announced for the program to become a yearly summer event, but it never happened.\n\nThe \"Family\" sketches led to a 1982 CBS made-for-television film called ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'' starring Burnett, Korman, Lawrence, Betty White, and Ken Berry. The success of this program spawned a spin-off sitcom titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'', starring Vicki Lawrence and Ken Berry, which ran from 1983 to 1990. It occasionally featured Burnett and Korman guest-starring as Eunice and Ed Higgins; Burnett's involvement in ''Mama's Family'' was limited due to her divorce from producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=123891&page=1 |title=Humor Helps Carol Burnett Cope \u2013 ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> In the first year and a half of the show's run, Korman also appeared as narrator Alastair Quince, introducing each episode (a parody of [[Alastair Cooke]] hosting ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'') and he also directed 31 episodes of the series.\n\n[[NBC]] aired a comedy half-hour repertory series called ''[[Carol & Company]]'' that premiered in March 1990. It proved to be moderately successful in the ratings and was renewed for a second season. The regulars on the show included [[Peter Krause]], [[Jeremy Piven]], [[Terry Kiser]], [[Meagen Fay]], [[Anita Barone]], and [[Richard Kind]] (and occasional guest stars, including [[Betty White]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]); each week's show was a different half-hour comedy play. This program lasted until July 1991.\n\nCBS brought back ''The Carol Burnett Show'' for another run in the fall of 1991; new regulars included Meagen Fay and Richard Kind (brought over from the NBC show), and [[Chris Barnes (actor)|Chris Barnes]], [[Roger Kabler]], and [[Jessica Lundy]]. However, the times had changed and Burnett's humor was tame compared to the edgier comedy popular in the 1990s. The series failed to catch on with the public and only six episodes of this revival were aired.\n\nIn 1994, reruns of the syndicated ''Carol Burnett and Friends'' package aired on [[Nick at Nite]]. The show also aired on [[History of Freeform (TV channel)#The Family Channel|The Family Channel]] in 1996 and on [[TV Land]] as part of that network's inaugural lineup from 1996 to 1997 and again from 2004 to 2005.

Because of this format, material from the first five seasons did not air, outside of their original run, until 2019 when [[MeTV]] acquired the rights to these earlier seasons and began airing them.  The cast has periodically reunited for various one-off specials and short appearances, and several members of the cast went on to star in ''[[Mama's Family]]'' (1983\u20131990), a half-hour [[situation comedy]] based on a sketch series from ''The Carol Burnett Show''.  \n\nIn 2013, ''TV Guide'' ranked ''The Carol Burnett Show'' number 17 on its list of the 60 Greatest Shows of All Time.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fretts |first=Bruce |last2=Roush |first2=Matt |title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Best Series of All Time |journal=TV Guide Magazine |date= 23 December 2013 |url= https://www.tvguide.com/news/tv-guide-magazine-60-best-series-1074962/|accessdate=15 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nBy 1967, Carol Burnett had been a popular veteran of television for 12 years, having made her first appearances in 1955 on ''The Paul Winchell Show'' and the sitcom ''[[Stanley (1956 TV series)|Stanley]]'' starring the comedian [[Buddy Hackett]]. In 1959, she became a regular supporting cast member on the CBS-TV variety series ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]''. Departing the Moore Show in the spring of 1962, she pursued other projects in film,  Broadway productions, and headlining her own television specials.  Burnett signed a contract with CBS for 10 years which required her to do two guest appearances and a special a year. Within the first five years of this contract, she had the option to \"push the button\", a phrase the programming executives used,<ref>{{cite book |last= Burnett|first= Carol|date= 2016|title=  In Such Good Company: Eleven Years of Laughter, Mayhem, and Fun in the Sandbox|url= |location= New York City|publisher= Crown Archetype|page= 4|isbn= 978-1101904657|author-link= }}</ref> and be put on the air in 30 one-hour variety shows, [[pay-or-play]]. After discussion with her husband [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], in the last week of the fifth year of the contract, Burnett decided to call the head of CBS [[Michael Dann]] and exercise the clause. Dann, explaining that variety is a \"man's genre\", offered Burnett a sitcom called ''Here's Agnes''. Burnett had no interest in doing a sitcom, and because of the contract, CBS was obliged to give Burnett her own variety show.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Carol Burnett show cast 1977.JPG|thumb|230px|On the left, main cast members in 1967 (clockwise from the bottom): Burnett, Harvey Korman, Vicki Lawrence, and Lyle Waggoner, on the right, the 1977 cast: Burnett, Tim Conway, Lawrence, and Korman]]\nIn addition to Carol Burnett, the cast consisted of:\n*[[Vicki Lawrence]]\n*[[Harvey Korman]] (seasons 1\u201310)\n*[[Lyle Waggoner]] (seasons 1\u20137)\n*[[Tim Conway]] (seasons 9\u201311; frequent guest performer in seasons 1\u20138)\n*[[Dick Van Dyke]] (first half of season 11)\nComedic actor Harvey Korman had done many guest shots in TV sitcoms. From 1963 to 1967, he had been a semi-regular on the CBS variety series ''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''. When Kaye's program ended in the spring of 1967, Korman was immediately hired for ''The Carol Burnett Show''. \n\nAt this particular time, actor Lyle Waggoner had recently auditioned for the title role in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series [[Batman]] but was passed over in favor of [[Adam West]]. Shortly after, Waggoner auditioned for the Burnett show and was immediately hired.  He would sometimes play the handsome man for Burnett to fawn over. His participation on the series was somewhat modeled on [[Durward Kirby]]  of ''The Garry Moore Show'' as Waggoner also functioned as the show's announcer in addition to playing in sketches.\n\n[[File:Carol Burnett Vicki Lawrence Dinah Shore Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|left|Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, and guest star [[Dinah Shore]] in the 1976 ''[[Went with the Wind!]]'' sketch]]\nVicki Lawrence, a young singer from [[The Young Americans]] wrote a letter to Burnett when she was 17, remarking on their physical resemblance. This led to her audition and getting hired to play Burnett's kid sister in numerous \"Carol and Sis\" sketches.\n\n[[Jim Nabors]] was the guest star on every season premiere of the show. Burnett considered Nabors to be her annual good luck charm.\n\nIn addition, several notable actors were used in the comedy sketches in featured roles, especially in the first season, such as [[William Schallert]], [[Isabel Sanford]], and [[Reta Shaw]].\n\nThe popular variety show not only established Burnett as a television superstar, but it also made her regular supporting cast household names, with such sketches as \"[[As the Stomach Turns]]\", (a parody of ''[[As the World Turns]]'') and \"[[Went with the Wind!]]\" (a spoof of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''), \"Carol & Sis\", \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\", and \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" (which led to a [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie titled ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', as well as a spin-off television series titled ''[[Mama's Family]]''), \"Nora Desmond\" (Burnett's send-up of [[Gloria Swanson]]'s character [[Norma Desmond]] in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''), and \"Stella Toddler\". A frequent repeated segment was \"Kitchen Commercials\", in which cast members parodied TV commercials that drove a woman (Burnett) crazy. The long-running show was frequently nominated for [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] for best variety series and won three times.\n\nA favorite feature consisted of an unrehearsed question-and-answer segment with the audience in CBS Studio 33 (now [[Bob Barker]] Studio) lasting about three to four minutes at the start of most shows. Burnett stated that she borrowed the concept from Garry Moore, who did the same on his variety show, but never taped it.<ref>\"The Florence Henderson Show\" RLTV, 2009</ref> Burnett asked for the lights to be turned up (\"let's bump up the lights\") and then randomly picked audience members who raised their hands. Burnett often ad-libbed funny answers, but occasionally ended up as the straight (wo)man. For example:\n\n:Young woman: \"Have you ever taken acting lessons?\"\n:Carol: \"Yes, I have.\"\n:Young woman: \"Do you think it did any good?\"\n\nThe show was rehearsed each day until its two Friday tapings. Differently colored cue cards (black, blue, green, and red) were used for each major performer (\"Carol Burnett: Bump-Up the Lights\"). The second taping was fairly routine until Tim Conway came aboard as a guest star.\nAs a recurring guest star from the show's launch and later a regular cast member, Conway provided unrehearsed bits to sketches that became known to the staff as \"Conway's Capers\". Conway would play the first taping straight, but (if the sketch had played well in the first taping, and could be used) would ad-lib bizarre scenarios during the second. Some notable clips included Conway as a Nazi interrogator berating an American captive (Lyle Waggoner). Using a Hitler puppet and a pencil as a \"club\", Conway sang three verses of \"[[I've Been Working on the Railroad]]\" as Waggoner tried in vain to ignore him. Some, like the Hitler puppet, made it into the final broadcast; others, like a notably convoluted story about Siamese elephants joined at the trunk (ad-libbed during a 1977 \"Mama's Family\" sketch), were edited, the uncensored version only appearing years later on CBS specials. Conway's favorite victim was Harvey Korman, who often broke character reacting to Conway's zaniness, such as when Conway played a dentist misusing Novocain or the recurring role of [[The Oldest Man (character)|\"The Oldest Man\"]] \u2013 an elderly, shuffling, senile man who slowly rolled down stairways and fell prey to various mechanical mishaps (including an electric wheelchair and an automated dry-cleaning rack).\n\nThe show also became known for its closing theme song, written by Burnett's husband, with these lyrics:<ref>{{cite web| last=Bell| first=Warren| title=Have a Laugh and Sing a Song| url=http://old.nationalreview.com/bell/bell200511090809.asp| accessdate=August 19, 2011| date=November 9, 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> \n:I'm so glad we had this time together\n:Just to have a laugh or sing a song\n:Seems we just get started and before you know it\n:Comes the time we have to say, \"So long.\"\n\nAt the close of each episode, Burnett tugged her ear. This silent message was meant for her grandmother, who raised her, and meant she was thinking of her at that moment. After her grandmother's death, Burnett continued the tradition.\n\n==Broadcast==\nWhen ''The Carol Burnett Show'' made its network debut on CBS-TV in September 1967, it was scheduled on Monday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm opposite NBC\u2019s ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' and ABC\u2019s ''[[The Big Valley]]''. At the end of its first season and through the spring of 1971, it consistently ranked among the top-30 programs. (For the 1969\u201370 season, it posted its highest rating ever, ranking at number 13.) For season five, CBS moved the show to Wednesday nights at 8:00&nbsp;pm, where its chief competition was NBC\u2019s ''[[Adam-12]]'' and the ABC sitcoms ''[[Bewitched]]'' and ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]''. Despite the schedule change, the show continued to do well until the fall of 1972, when the ratings slipped. In December 1972, CBS again moved ''The Carol Burnett Show'' to Saturday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm (EST) where, for the next four years, it not only received solid ratings, but was also part of a powerhouse Saturday-night lineup of primetime shows that included ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', and ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''.\n\nIn the 1973\u201374 season, the \"Family\" sketches (with Burnett as Eunice, Korman as her husband Ed, and Lawrence as Eunice's mother) were introduced and the \"Carol and Sis\" segments were phased out. At the end of that season (the series' seventh), after having been with ''The Carol Burnett Show'' from the beginning, Lyle Waggoner left the series to pursue other acting opportunities. The following season, Waggoner's spot as a supporting regular remained vacant. Don Crichton, the lead male dancer on the show, began to inherit some of Waggoner's duties. Then in season nine, because of his many popular guest appearances on the series, Tim Conway was signed as a full-time regular, joining Korman and Lawrence.\n\n[[File:Tim Conway Carol Burnett Dick Van Dyke Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|150px|From left to right: Conway, Burnett, and Dick Van Dyke in the final season]]\nIn November, 1976, the series' tenth year, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' presented what would become one of its best-known and most well-regarded sketches: \"[[Went with the Wind!]],\" a parody of the 1939 film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', which had its television debut on NBC the week before. After the 1976-77 season ended, Harvey Korman decided to leave the series. After a decade of working with Burnett and winning several Emmy Awards, Korman had been offered a contract by ABC to headline his own series. Also, the ratings had begun to decline. Nevertheless, CBS renewed Burnett's show for an 11th season.\n\nDick Van Dyke, fresh from headlining his own short-lived Emmy-winning variety series, ''Van Dyke & Company'', was brought in to replace Korman. However, his presence did not help stem the sagging ratings, as the show faced new competition in ABC's ''[[The Love Boat]]''. After three months, Van Dyke departed the show, and CBS, in a desperate attempt to save the series, moved ''The Carol Burnett Show'' from Saturday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm to Sunday nights at the same hour, beginning in December 1977. Regular guest stars [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Ken Berry]] were brought in to fill the void left by Korman and Van Dyke. The ratings improved considerably.\n\nCBS wanted to renew the show for another year, but by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre, despite her success in it. With the changes in cast along with the mediocre ratings, she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out. Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later. Thus, on March 29, 1978, in a special two-hour finale entitled \"[[A Special Evening with Carol Burnett]]\", ''The Carol Burnett Show'' left primetime television after 11 years, finishing its last season in 66th place. Reruns were aired during the summer of 1978.\n\n==Notable characters/sketches==\n\n[[File:Carol Burnett charwoman character 1974.JPG|thumb|150px|Burnett as the Charwoman]]\n[[File:Carol Burnett Madeline Kahn Eunice Carol Burnett Show.JPG|thumb|150px|Burnett as Eunice with [[Madeline Kahn]] in \"The Family\" sketch]]\n\n*[[As the Stomach Turns]] \u2013 a [[soap opera]] parody taking place in the fictional town of Canoga Falls with Burnett as the main character Marion.\n*Carol and Sis \u2013 Burnett as Carol and Lawrence as her sister Chris with Korman as Carol's husband Roger;<ref name=\"Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004 1\">{{cite book| first= Wesley| last= Hyatt| year= 2006| title= Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004| edition=| publisher= McFarland & Company| location=| pages= 239| isbn= 978-0786423293}}</ref> the sketch was based on Burnett's life in New York raising her kid sister in New York with her first husband, and Lawrence was originally hired just for this sketch.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=9 January 2017}}</ref>\n*The Charwoman \u2013 Burnett's signature character, an unnamed [[charwoman]] (most often in a musical number),<ref name=\"Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004 2\">{{cite book| first= Wesley| last= Hyatt| year= 2006| title= Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004| edition=| publisher= McFarland & Company| location=| pages= 240| isbn= 978-0786423293}}</ref> whose animated image has been used in the opening credits, and also in the opening and closing credits of ''Carol Burnett and Friends''.\n*Chiquita \u2013 Burnett's parody of [[Charo]];

Many of these film parodies were written or co-written by [[Stan Hart]], [[Arnie Kogen]] and [[Larry Siegel]], all prolific contributors for [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine, with each authoring dozens of the magazine's own movie satires.\n\n==After the series==\n\n===Continuations and revivals===\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2018}}\nIn the fall of 1977, while the series was still running in prime time, the comedy sketches of the show were re-edited into freestanding programs; the resulting show enjoyed success for many years in [[television syndication|syndicated]] [[rerun]]s (as ''Carol Burnett and Friends'', a half-hour edition of selected 1972\u201377 material).\n\nIn the spring of 1979, a year after ''The Carol Burnett Show'' left the air, Burnett and her husband Joe Hamilton were dining in a restaurant with friends, including Tim Conway. At that gathering, Burnett got wistful and started reminiscing about the show and making suggestions to Conway concerning sketches that she wished they could be creating if the show were still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series. Taking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979. CBS already had its schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea. However, ABC was interested, and as a result, four postscript episodes of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' were produced. Under the title ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'', the show premiered on Saturday, August 18, 1979, and included many favorite sketches such as \"Mr. Tudball and Mrs. Wiggins\", \"The Family\", \"As The Stomach Turns\", and Burnett doing her impersonation of Queen Elizabeth II. Its format was very much similar to Burnett's series, with two exceptions. Due to the unavailability of Harvey Korman (who, ironically, had been under contract to ABC since he had left Burnett's show in 1977), comic actors [[Kenneth Mars]] and [[Craig Richard Nelson]] were added to the supporting cast, joining Lawrence and Conway. [[Ernie Flatt]], who had been the choreographer on Burnett's show for its entire 11-year run, was replaced by the show's lead dancer Don Crichton. The guest stars in that four-week period were (chronologically) [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]], and [[Sally Field]]. The reviews of the series were very favorable, with several critics heartily welcoming Burnett back to weekly television, albeit on a limited basis. The ratings also were respectable and plans were announced for the program to become a yearly summer event, but it never happened.\n\nThe \"Family\" sketches led to a 1982 CBS made-for-television film called ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'' starring Burnett, Korman, Lawrence, Betty White, and Ken Berry. The success of this program spawned a spin-off sitcom titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'', starring Vicki Lawrence and Ken Berry, which ran from 1983 to 1990. It occasionally featured Burnett and Korman guest-starring as Eunice and Ed Higgins; Burnett's involvement in ''Mama's Family'' was limited due to her divorce from producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=123891&page=1 |title=Humor Helps Carol Burnett Cope \u2013 ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> In the first year and a half of the show's run, Korman also appeared as narrator Alastair Quince, introducing each episode (a parody of [[Alastair Cooke]] hosting ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'') and he also directed 31 episodes of the series.\n\n[[NBC]] aired a comedy half-hour repertory series called ''[[Carol & Company]]'' that premiered in March 1990. It proved to be moderately successful in the ratings and was renewed for a second season. The regulars on the show included [[Peter Krause]], [[Jeremy Piven]], [[Terry Kiser]], [[Meagen Fay]], [[Anita Barone]], and [[Richard Kind]] (and occasional guest stars, including [[Betty White]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]); each week's show was a different half-hour comedy play. This program lasted until July 1991.\n\nCBS brought back ''The Carol Burnett Show'' for another run in the fall of 1991; new regulars included Meagen Fay and Richard Kind (brought over from the NBC show), and [[Chris Barnes (actor)|Chris Barnes]], [[Roger Kabler]], and [[Jessica Lundy]]. However, the times had changed and Burnett's humor was tame compared to the edgier comedy popular in the 1990s. The series failed to catch on with the public and only six episodes of this revival were aired.\n\nIn 1994, reruns of the syndicated ''Carol Burnett and Friends'' package aired on [[Nick at Nite]]. The show also aired on [[History of Freeform (TV channel)#The Family Channel|The Family Channel]] in 1996 and on [[TV Land]] as part of that network's inaugural lineup from 1996 to 1997 and again from 2004 to 2005.
