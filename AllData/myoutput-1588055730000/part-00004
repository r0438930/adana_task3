Gross]]' book ''[[Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne, Poland|Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne, Poland]]''. The growing public interest in this issue prompted an official murder investigation by the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]] in 2000-2003 which confirmed that the main perpetrators were ethnic Poles. The country was shocked by its findings, which challenged the common narratives regarding [[The Holocaust in Poland]], where the main perpetrators were generally described as Germans and not the Poles. President of Poland, [[Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski]] apologized on behalf of the country in a memorial ceremony at Jedwabne in 2001. A decade later, the apology was repeated by President [[Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski]].\n\n==Background==\n===Jedwabne===\n[[File:Jedwabne synagogue 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Jedwabne synagogue]] was burned down in an accident in 1913.]]\nThe Jewish community in [[Jedwabne]] was established in the 17th or 18th century.{{sfn|Baker|Tzinovitz|1980|p=5}} In 1937, 60 percent of the population were ethnic Poles and 40 percent Jewish. In 1939 the total population was around 2,720 to 2,800.{{sfn|Cienciala|2003|p=52}} (At the time about 10 percent of the population of Poland\u201435 million\u2014was Jewish; it was the largest Jewish population in the world.){{sfn|Cienciala|2003|p=55}}\n\nThe region supported the right-wing [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] of the [[National Democracy]] movement,{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=18}} which sought to counter what it said was Jewish economic competition against Catholics, and opposed the Polish socialist government of [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] and his successors.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=39}} Prewar Polish-Jewish relations in the town were relatively good before 1939.{{sfn|Cienciala|2003|pp=53\u201354}} At their most tense, when a Jewish woman was killed in Jedwabne and a Polish peasant in another town was killed a few days later, a rumor began that the Jedwabne Jews had taken revenge. The Jews anticipated a pogrom, but the local priest and rabbi stepped in, addressing the matter together.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=39}}\n\n===World War II===\n{{main|Invasion of Poland|Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939\u20131946)}}\n[[European Theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]] began on 1 September 1939 with the invasion of Poland by [[Nazi Germany]]. Later that month, the Soviet [[Red Army]] invaded the [[Kresy|eastern regions of Poland]] under the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]].{{sfn|Kitchen|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QAStAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA74 74]}} The Germans transferred the area around Jedwabne to the Soviets in accordance with the [[German\u2013Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty|German\u2013Soviet Boundary Treaty]] of 28 September 1939.{{sfn|Tec|1993|p=17}} [[Anna M. Cienciala]] writes that most of the Jews understandably welcomed the Soviets as a \"lesser evil than the Germans\". The business and [[Orthodox Jew|Orthodox communities]] did not support the [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideology of the Soviets, and the latter, suspicious of the Jewish intelligentsia, arrested leaders of the socialist [[General Jewish Labour Bund|Jewish Bund]]. According to [[NKVD]] (Soviet secret police) documents about Jedwabne and the surrounding area, \"few Jews were involved as agents and informers, fewer in fact than Poles\", she writes.{{sfn|Cienciala|2003|p=58}} But a number of young Jews did accept roles within the Soviet administration and militia, and according to Cienciala, it was widely known that communist Jews helped the NKVD find and arrest Polish officials [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|to be deported]]. (Twenty percent of those deported in 1940\u20131941 were Jews.){{sfn|Cienciala|2003|p=56}} \n\nBikont writes that the Poles and Jews of Jedwabne had differing experiences of the local militia under Soviet occupation, which provided names to the authorities of anti-communist and antisemitic [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] members: \"Polish accounts repeated that they were made up of Jews. The Jews themselves talk about Jews who made themselves of service to the Soviets in this first period, but they emphasize that they were the exception rather than the rule.\"{{sfn|Bikont|2015|pp=167-174}} Regardless of the extent of the collaboration, it \"strengthened the widely held stereotype of [[Judaeo-communism]] which had been promoted by right-wing parties before the war\", write [[Jerzy Lukowski]] and Hubert Zawadzki. The betrayal felt by ethnic Poles provided a backdrop to the pogroms in Jedwabne and elsewhere.{{sfn|Cienciala|2003|pp=56\u201357, 59}}{{sfn|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2019|p=334}} Following Germany's [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, German forces again overran Jedwabne and other parts of Poland that had been occupied by the Soviets.{{sfn|Matth\u00e4us|2004|p=244}} [[Christopher Browning]] writes: \"Criminal orders from above and violent impulses from below created a climate of unmitigated violence.{{sfn|Browning|2004|p=259}}\n\n===Pogroms===\n{{further|W\u0105sosz pogrom|Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom}}\nAfter the German occupation, Polish villagers participated in [[pogrom]]s against Jews in 23 localities of the [[\u0141om\u017ca]] and [[Bia\u0142ystok]] areas of the [[Podlasie]] region, with varying degrees of German involvement.

Hooligans bestially beat them up on the way. Near the gate a few hooligans were standing, playing various instruments in order to drown the screams of horrified victims. Some tried to defend themselves, but they were defenseless. Bloodied and wounded, they were pushed into the barn.

According to various accounts, Persak writes, the Germans had set up a ''[[Feldgendarmerie#Operations|Feldgendarmerie]]'' in Jedwabne, staffed by eight or eleven military police.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=411\u2013412}} The police reportedly set up a \"collaborationist civilian town council\" led by a former mayor, Marian Karolak. Karolak established a local police force, whose members included Eugeniusz Kalinowsk and Jerzy Laudanski. The town council is reported to have included Eugeniusz Sliwecki, J\u00f3zef Sobutka, and J\u00f3zef Wasilewski. Karol Bardon, a translator for the Germans, may also have been a member.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=900}}\n\nThere is general agreement that German police were seen in Jedwabne on the morning of 10 July 1941, or the day before, and met with the town council.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=412\u2013413}} Szmuel Wasersztajn's witness statement in 1945 said that eight Gestapo men arrived on 10 July and met with the town authorities.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=18}} Another witness said four or five Gestapo men arrived and \"they began to talk in the town hall\". \"Gestapo man\" was used to refer to any German in a black uniform, Persak writes. The witnesses said they believed the meeting had been held to discuss murdering the town's Jews.{{efn|Krzysztof Persak (2011): \"The direct perpetrators of those crimes was a sizeable group of residents of Jedwabne and neighboring villages. Those involved in the pogrom took different roles: some killed the victims with their own hands, others supervised the Jews assembled in the market square and escorted them to the execution site in the barn, while some robbed Jewish homes or simply formed a hostile crowd of onlookers. The witnesses were fairly unanimous in assigning the role of pogrom organizers to members of the temporary municipal authorities, with Mayor Karolak at the head. Probably a significant part of the massacre was performed by members of the order service subordinated to them, of which, however, we know very little.{{pb}}\"Far less clear is the role played in Jedwabne by representatives of the German occupation authorities. Undoubtedly, they fully approved and possibly inspired the murder. According to testimony of the then-messenger at the gendarmerie post, Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski, before the pogrom 'four or five Gestapo men had arrived in a cab, and they began to talk in the town hall.' In colloquial Polish, a 'cab' (''taks\u00f3wka'') denoted a motor car, and 'Gestapo man' referred to any German in a black uniform. This reference, no doubt, relates to the meeting of the temporary municipal authorities with\u2014probably\u2014functionaries of the German Security Police or Security Service (''Sicherheitspolizei'' or ''Sicherheitsdienst''), mentioned by other witnesses as well. Although accounts regarding that issue are all secondhand, their common denominator is that during that 'conference' the decision to murder the Jedwabne Jews was taken.\"{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}}}\n\nThe IPN found that some Jews had been alerted by non-Jewish acquaintances the evening before that \"a collective action was being prepared against the Jews\".{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Gross writes that a leading role in the pogrom was carried out by four men, including Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski and Karol Bardo\u0144, who had earlier collaborated with the Soviet [[NKVD]] and were now trying to recast themselves as zealous collaborators with the Germans.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=75}} He also writes that no \"sustained organized activity\" could have taken place in the town without the Germans' consent.{{sfn|Gross|2001|pp=46\u201347}} Several witnesses reported seeing German photographers take pictures of the massacre. There was also speculation that the pogrom was filmed.{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Persak writes that the area around [[\u0141om\u017ca]] and western [[Bia\u0142ystok]] was one of the few Polish majority areas that had just undergone the cruelty of Soviet occupation since 1939. They therefore saw Germans as liberators when they arrived in 1941; paired with historical antisemitism, the conditions were right for German incitement.{{sfn|Persak|2011}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<!--primary sources: Several Jewish eyewitnesses reported that the Germans were directly involved in rounding up and abusing Jews in the town square, and that they shot at Jews who tried to escape from the burning barn.

Gross]]' book ''[[Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne, Poland|Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne, Poland]]''. The growing public interest in this issue prompted an official murder investigation by the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]] in 2000-2003 which confirmed that the main perpetrators were ethnic Poles. The country was shocked by its findings, which challenged the common narratives regarding [[The Holocaust in Poland]], where the main perpetrators were generally described as Germans and not the Poles. President of Poland, [[Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski]] apologized on behalf of the country in a memorial ceremony at Jedwabne in 2001. A decade later, the apology was repeated by President [[Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski]].\n\n==Background==\n===Jedwabne===\n[[File:Jedwabne synagogue 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Jedwabne synagogue]] was burned down in an accident in 1913.]]\nThe Jewish community in [[Jedwabne]] was established in the 17th or 18th century.{{sfn|Baker|Tzinovitz|1980|p=5}} In 1937, 60 percent of the population were ethnic Poles and 40 percent Jewish. In 1939 the total population was around 2,720 to 2,800.{{sfn|Cienciala|2003|p=52}} (At the time about 10 percent of the population of Poland\u201435 million\u2014was Jewish; it was the largest Jewish population in the world.){{sfn|Cienciala|2003|p=55}}\n\nThe region supported the right-wing [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] of the [[National Democracy]] movement,{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=18}} which sought to counter what it said was Jewish economic competition against Catholics, and opposed the Polish socialist government of [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] and his successors.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=39}} Prewar Polish-Jewish relations in the town were relatively good before 1939.{{sfn|Cienciala|2003|pp=53\u201354}} At their most tense, when a Jewish woman was killed in Jedwabne and a Polish peasant in another town was killed a few days later, a rumor began that the Jedwabne Jews had taken revenge. The Jews anticipated a pogrom, but the local priest and rabbi stepped in, addressing the matter together.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=39}}\n\n===World War II===\n{{main|Invasion of Poland|Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939\u20131946)}}\n[[European Theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]] began on 1 September 1939 with the invasion of Poland by [[Nazi Germany]].

Cienciala]] writes that most of the Jews understandably welcomed the Soviets as a \"lesser evil than the Germans\". The business and [[Orthodox Jew|Orthodox communities]] did not support the [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideology of the Soviets, and the latter, suspicious of the Jewish intelligentsia, arrested leaders of the socialist [[General Jewish Labour Bund|Jewish Bund]]. According to [[NKVD]] (Soviet secret police) documents about Jedwabne and the surrounding area, \"few Jews were involved as agents and informers, fewer in fact than Poles\", she writes.{{sfn|Cienciala|2003|p=58}} But a number of young Jews did accept roles within the Soviet administration and militia, and according to Cienciala, it was widely known that communist Jews helped the NKVD find and arrest Polish officials [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|to be deported]]. (Twenty percent of those deported in 1940\u20131941 were Jews.){{sfn|Cienciala|2003|p=56}} \n\nBikont writes that the Poles and Jews of Jedwabne had differing experiences of the local militia under Soviet occupation, which provided names to the authorities of anti-communist and antisemitic [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] members: \"Polish accounts repeated that they were made up of Jews.

Hooligans bestially beat them up on the way. Near the gate a few hooligans were standing, playing various instruments in order to drown the screams of horrified victims.

According to various accounts, Persak writes, the Germans had set up a ''[[Feldgendarmerie#Operations|Feldgendarmerie]]'' in Jedwabne, staffed by eight or eleven military police.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=411\u2013412}} The police reportedly set up a \"collaborationist civilian town council\" led by a former mayor, Marian Karolak. Karolak established a local police force, whose members included Eugeniusz Kalinowsk and Jerzy Laudanski. The town council is reported to have included Eugeniusz Sliwecki, J\u00f3zef Sobutka, and J\u00f3zef Wasilewski. Karol Bardon, a translator for the Germans, may also have been a member.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=900}}\n\nThere is general agreement that German police were seen in Jedwabne on the morning of 10 July 1941, or the day before, and met with the town council.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=412\u2013413}} Szmuel Wasersztajn's witness statement in 1945 said that eight Gestapo men arrived on 10 July and met with the town authorities.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=18}} Another witness said four or five Gestapo men arrived and \"they began to talk in the town hall\". \"Gestapo man\" was used to refer to any German in a black uniform, Persak writes. The witnesses said they believed the meeting had been held to discuss murdering the town's Jews.{{efn|Krzysztof Persak (2011): \"The direct perpetrators of those crimes was a sizeable group of residents of Jedwabne and neighboring villages. Those involved in the pogrom took different roles: some killed the victims with their own hands, others supervised the Jews assembled in the market square and escorted them to the execution site in the barn, while some robbed Jewish homes or simply formed a hostile crowd of onlookers. The witnesses were fairly unanimous in assigning the role of pogrom organizers to members of the temporary municipal authorities, with Mayor Karolak at the head. Probably a significant part of the massacre was performed by members of the order service subordinated to them, of which, however, we know very little.{{pb}}\"Far less clear is the role played in Jedwabne by representatives of the German occupation authorities. Undoubtedly, they fully approved and possibly inspired the murder. According to testimony of the then-messenger at the gendarmerie post, Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski, before the pogrom 'four or five Gestapo men had arrived in a cab, and they began to talk in the town hall.' In colloquial Polish, a 'cab' (''taks\u00f3wka'') denoted a motor car, and 'Gestapo man' referred to any German in a black uniform. This reference, no doubt, relates to the meeting of the temporary municipal authorities with\u2014probably\u2014functionaries of the German Security Police or Security Service (''Sicherheitspolizei'' or ''Sicherheitsdienst''), mentioned by other witnesses as well. Although accounts regarding that issue are all secondhand, their common denominator is that during that 'conference' the decision to murder the Jedwabne Jews was taken.\"{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}}}\n\nThe IPN found that some Jews had been alerted by non-Jewish acquaintances the evening before that \"a collective action was being prepared against the Jews\".{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Gross writes that a leading role in the pogrom was carried out by four men, including Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski and Karol Bardo\u0144, who had earlier collaborated with the Soviet [[NKVD]] and were now trying to recast themselves as zealous collaborators with the Germans.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=75}} He also writes that no \"sustained organized activity\" could have taken place in the town without the Germans' consent.{{sfn|Gross|2001|pp=46\u201347}} Several witnesses reported seeing German photographers take pictures of the massacre. There was also speculation that the pogrom was filmed.{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Persak writes that the area around [[\u0141om\u017ca]] and western [[Bia\u0142ystok]] was one of the few Polish majority areas that had just undergone the cruelty of Soviet occupation since 1939. They therefore saw Germans as liberators when they arrived in 1941; paired with historical antisemitism, the conditions were right for German incitement.{{sfn|Persak|2011}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<!--primary sources: Several Jewish eyewitnesses reported that the Germans were directly involved in rounding up and abusing Jews in the town square, and that they shot at Jews who tried to escape from the burning barn. According to a diary penned during the war, citing reports by Jews who fled Jedwabne and Radzi\u0142\u00f3w, \"With the help of local farmers, the Germans gathered the Jews of these places, the rabbi and community leaders foremost, in the market square.

The book includes articles from Polish and other historians, the IPN's findings, and essays from Polish newspapers such as ''[[Rzeczpospolita]]'' and ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]''. The collection features archival documents and essays covering the entire 1939\u20131941 period.

It was well preplanned, initiated by the Germans, and utterly lacked any pogrom-like spontaneity.\" Chodakiewicz's good arguments, Wr\u00f3bel wrote, are \"overshadowed by numerous flaws\", lack a sense of proportion, and make selective use of information from sources that support Chodakiewicz's view. According to Wr\u00f3bel, the book has a \"visible political agenda\" and is \"difficult to read, unoriginal, irritating, and unconvincing\".{{sfn|Wr\u00f3bel|2006b}}\n\nReviewing the book for ''[[History (journal)|History]]'', [[Peter D. Stachura]] agreed with Chodakiewicz that the pogrom had been executed by German police, \"with only limited involvement from a very small number of Poles\", including \"''Volksdeutsche'' (Polish citizens of German origin) and petty criminals\".{{sfn|Stachura|2007}} In response, [[Joanna Michlic]] and [[Antony Polonsky]] complained about the review to the editor of ''History''. Chodakiewicz's and Stachura's conclusions were \"very far from those reached by most historians\", they wrote, including the IPN. Chodakiewicz and Stachura \"uphold a view of the Polish past which seeks to return to an untenable vision of modern Poland as solely victim and hero&nbsp;... It is a matter of considerable regret to us that you have allowed your journal to be used to advance this neo-nationalist agenda.\"{{sfn|Michlic|Polonsky|2008}} Stachura took exception to their letter.
