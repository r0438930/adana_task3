In places where the earth's crust slowly rises or where mountainous land areas are destroyed for a long time, a plateau is formed. On the Northern slopes of the [[Zailiysky Alatau]] mountains, the [[Mynzhylki]] mountain plateau is located at the source of the [[Malaya Almaatinka]] river at an altitude of 3000 meters above sea level. Translated from the [[Kazakh language]], '''''Means a thousand mares'''''. That is, a place suitable for grazing many horses. From Mynzhylki you can climb to the glaciological station [[Tuyuksu]]-1 (3400 m), to [[Alpengrad]] (3450 m), from where climbers make ascents to the peaks of the [[Maloalmatinsky]] node, to the [[Titova]] pass (3630 m).\n\n==Description==\nIf you walk along the plateau to the final moraine of the Tuyuksu glacier and climb a little along the serpentine, you can see the famous Tuyuksu Horseshoe - the four-thousandth peaks that form the horseshoe. Climate mountain average annual temperature -2.7 degrees, 237 days a year there is snow, precipitation falls 743 millimeters a year. Here, at an altitude of 3020 meters above sea level, the Malaya Almatinsk river is blocked by an anti-settlement dam - a metal mesh filled with stones 17.0 m high, 300 meters long and with a storage capacity of 0.23 million m3. Next to the dam is the hydrometeorological station Mynzh, which has been conducting its observations since 1936. From the dam, it is impossible to see the entire panorama of the circus of the Tuyuksu glacier, because it is closed by a high moraine shaft in the upper reaches of the tract. Only Ordzhonikidze and Tuyuksu peaks are visible. In the North direction from the mynzhilki tract, the rock Bastion of the Yoshkar-Ola peak is visible on the right in the ridge above the road. From the weather station on the trail you can climb to the popular Parking lot called \"Alpingrad\", located in the circus of the glacier M. Mametova at the foot of the peaks of Amangeldy and Pioner.\nIt offers a panorama of the Central part of the Tuyuksu glacier and the Kumbel spur in the West, where the tops of Lokomotiv, Kosmodemyanskaya, Molodezhnaya, and Titova are located. There are three passes in the Kumbel spur: Lokomotiv and Molodezhny, leading to The kumbelsu gorge, and Titova pass, leading to the Gorelnik gorge.\nFrom the Alpingrad Parking lot, through the Pioner and Uchitel passes, you can get to the Bogdanovich glacier, which gives rise to the Sauruksai river, which flows into the Left Talgar river. [[Manshuk Mametova]] pass leads to The left Talgar gorge on the \"Sunny glade\".{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} From the Parking lot \"Alpingrad\" ascents are made to the peaks of Amangeldy, the pioneer-Teacher array, Panfilov Heroes, Manshuk Mametova, Antikainen. Then there is the well-known moraine lake No. 6.\nThe Mynzhylki mountain plateau is located at the source of the Little (Malaya) Almaatinka river, 28 kilometers South of [[Almaty]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The tract is surrounded by Tuyuksu glaciers. To get to mynzhilki, first you need to get to Medeo, then it is convenient to continue on the cable car to cimbulak, and then on foot-5.7&nbsp;km. the Road goes all the way to the plateau, the climb is not steep, starting from the \"Tuyuksu Gate\", it becomes harder to go \u2014 the height and slope increases. The weather, as elsewhere in the mountains, can change suddenly, especially outside the \"Gate\", where tourists are often met by a strong headwind. Above the beginning of the trail to \"Alpingrad\", between the right slope and the moraines of the Tuyuksu glacier, there are two more Parking lots - \"Tashkent\" and\"Black stone\". Parking \"Tashkent\" is a small enclosed grassy area, not blown by the winds. That's why it's warm in the Parking lot. The \"Black stone\" Parking lot is located above and is named after a characteristic large stone of dark color. From these sites, ascents are made to the tops of the Tuyuksu glacier circus, located in the Malo-Almaty spur, or category passes are passed in the Malo-Almaty spur, South of Mametova peak, leading to the Left Talgar gorge.\n\n==Protection and visit==\nThe Ile-Alatau state national natural Park<ref>http://www.ile-alatau.kz</ref> Administration is responsible for the preservation and protection of the monument. It has a favorable acoustic environment (silence, melodic sounds in nature). Recommended visiting periods: may - October. The route is avalanche-prone, namely after snowfall and in the spring.\n\n== Sources ==\n* [https://monographies.ru/en/book/section?id=13066 Ivashchenko A. A.
