{"title_page": "H\u00f8ve", "text_new": "'''H\u00f8ve''' is a village in northwest [[Zealand]] with fewer than 200 inhabitants (2011). H\u00f8ve is located near [[Sejer\u00f8]] Bay, five kilometers north of [[Asn\u00e6s]], 17 kilometers southwest of [[Nyk\u00f8bing Sj\u00e6lland]], and 25 kilometers northwest of [[Holb\u00e6k]]. The village is part of [[Odsherred Municipality]] and is in Asn\u00e6s Parish.\n[[File:hoeve esterhoej.jpg|thumb|210px|View from Esterh\u00f8j over H\u00f8ve and Lammefjorden]]\n\n== H\u00f8ve and the surrounding nature ==\nH\u00f8ve is where the road from [[Asn\u00e6s]] meets the main road stretching from Nyk\u00f8bing to Slagelse. Next to H\u00f8ve at 89 meters above sea level is [[Esterh\u00f8j]], an ancient burial mound, which has views over Sejer\u00f8 Bay and much of Lammefjorden. At the top of Esterh\u00f8j is a memorial stone commemorating the [[Schleswig Plebiscites]] in 1920. In earlier times, H\u00f8ve, like many other villages, had an active commercial life \u2013 there was a coop, a butcher, a baker, a painter, and even a little museum. Although these are gone, one can still buy specialty products such as stoves, curtains, and dried flowers.\n\nAbout a kilometer north of H\u00f8ve is H\u00f8ve beach. Earlier, the area down around Sejer\u00f8 Bay was grasslands, where animals went to graze, but now the beach is surrounded by woods and summerhouses. H\u00f8ve forest is quite small, but has a variety of conifers that were originally planted to prevent sand drifting, and beech trees on the moraine hills. The beach itself is popular swimming location. In the eastern end of the forest is a little campsite, while in the northern end, one can visit a summer restaurant.\n\n== Culture ==\nH\u00f8ve Friskole lies in the village's southern outskirts, overlooking Sejer\u00f8 Bay. The school was established in 1874 by a group of parents in H\u00f8ve and the surrounding region, and was inspired by the grundtvig-koldske school of thought. There are approximately 130 students at the school, which lends itself as a natural meeting place. The school's sports hall frequently doubles as a party room.\n\nThe grave site of Ole Olsen, the creator of [[Nordisk Film]], can be found a bit outside of H\u00f8ve, about 100 meters west of Esterh\u00f8j. The grave is perhaps inspired by the nearby Esterh\u00f8j, as it's shaped like an ancient burial mound. However, the grave's young age is revealed, as the door on the south side provides access to a peek inside the burial chamber. Through a small window, one can glimpse the urns that hold the remains of the famous filmmaker and his wife. The grave site is most easily accessed if one parks one's bike or car at the foot of Esterh\u00f8j and takes a short journey on foot.\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120829152651/http://www.hoeve-friskole.dk/index.php H\u00f8ve Friskole]\n* [http://www.hoeve-camping.dk/ H\u00f8ve Camping]\n* [http://www.hoeve-skov.dk/ H\u00f8ve Skovpavillon]\n\n{{coord|55.835|11.487|type:city_region:DK|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hove}}\n[[Category:Villages in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Odsherred Municipality]]\n", "text_old": "'''H\u00f8ve''' is a village in northwest [[Zealand]] with fewer than 200 inhabitants (2011).
