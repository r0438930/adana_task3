The current bridge is the second bridge located in Hay that crosses the Murrumbidgee; the first bridge was in operation from 1873 until 1973; the second and current bridge has operated since 1973.\n\n== Current bridge ==\nThe current Hay Bridge is a six-[[Span (architecture)|span]], [[reinforced concrete]] and steel [[box girder]] structure supported on steel piles and slender concrete piers. It has an overall length of {{convert|638|ft|m|0|order=flip}} with two {{convert|97|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} spans and four {{convert|105|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} spans, and is {{convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}} between kerbs. A {{convert|5|ft|m|0|adj=mid|order=flip|spell=on|-wide}} [[footway]] has been provided for pedestrian use.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n\nEach box girder is made up of five cells each {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} wide and {{convert|3|ft|3|in|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} high. The base and walls of each cell are steel plates and the reinforced concrete deck forms the top section. A feature of the design is the cantilever construction of the girders. This allows a greater distance between piers than a simply supported span design.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n\nHay is located on the Western Plains where the clay and silt deposit can be up to {{convert|1500|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in depth. Due to the complete absence of rock in this deposit, {{convert|10|x|10|in|cm|0|order=flip}} in rolled \"H\" section steel piles have been used for the [[Foundation (construction)|foundations]]. These vary from {{convert|51|to|81|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in length.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n\n[[Coffer dam]]s of steel sheet piling were constructed in the river to enable the construction of the two pile caps and the lower portions of the two piers in the river. The steel girders were manufactured at Sydney in pairs {{convert|15|ft|m|0|order=flip}} wide, transported by road to Hay and bolted together after having been placed in position on falsework. The longest sections handled were {{convert|65|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, end to end, and each weighed {{convert|24|ST|t|0|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n\nThe bridge was designed by Gordon Bull and Associates, Consulting Engineers and was constructed by contract to and under the supervision of the Department by Central Constructions Pty Ltd of New South Wales. The approaches were designed and constructed by the Department. The total cost of the bridge and approaches was {{AUD}}890,000. The completion of this bridge by the Department, together with the channelisation of the intersection of State Highways Nos 14 and 21 immediately south of the bridge and the reconstruction of Lachlan Street, State Highway No. 21, Cobb Highway by Hay Shire Council, immediately north of the bridge, ensured a smoother flow of traffic through the town of Hay.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n\nThe bridge was opened by the Honourable [[Harry Jago]], the NSW Assistant Minister for Highways, on {{start date|1973|06|08|df=y}}, the same day as he also opened a replacement bridge across the Murrumbidgee River at {{NSWcity|Balranald}}, located {{convert|80|mi|km|0|order=flip}} west.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n{{clear}}\n== Former bridge ==\n{{Infobox bridge\n| name                = (Old) Hay Bridge\n| native_name         = \n| native_name_lang    = \n| image               = Hay Bridge over Murrumbidgee River (Leader, Melbourne, Sat 3 Oct 1908 Page 28).jpg\n| image_upright       = 1.4\n| alt                 = \n| caption             = The old Hay Bridge in 1908\n| pushpin_map         = \n| pushpin_relief      = \n| pushpin_map_size    = \n| pushpin_map_alt     = \n| pushpin_map_caption = \n| coordinates         = <!-- {{Coord}} -->\n| os_grid_reference   = \n| qid                 = \n| refs                = \n| carries             = \n| crosses             = \n| locale              = \n| starts              = \n| ends                = \n| official_name       = \n| other_name          = \n| named_for           = \n| owner               = \n| maint               = \n| heritage            = \n| id                  = \n| id_type             = \n| website             = \n| preceded            = \n| followed            = \n| design              = \n| material            = \n| material1           = \n| material2           = \n| length              = \n| width               = \n| height              = \n| depth               = \n| traversable         = \n| towpath             = \n| mainspan            = {{convert|60|ft|m|1|order=flip}}\n| number_spans        = 4\n| piers_in_water      = \n| load                = \n| clearance_above     = \n| clearance_below     = \n| lanes               = \n| life                = \n| first_length        = \n| first_diameter      = \n| second_length       = \n| second_diameter     = \n| third_length        = \n| third_diameter      = \n| capacity            = \n| num_track           = \n| track_gauge         = \n| structure_gauge     = \n| electrification     = \n| architect           = \n| designer            = \n| contracted_designer = \n| winner              = \n| engineering         = \n| builder             = \n| fabricator          = [[Peter Nicol Russell|P.

The current bridge is the second bridge located in Hay that crosses the Murrumbidgee; the first bridge was in operation from 1873 until 1973; the second and current bridge has operated since 1973.\n\n== Current bridge ==\nThe current Hay Bridge is a six-[[Span (architecture)|span]], [[reinforced concrete]] and steel [[box girder]] structure supported on steel piles and slender concrete piers. It has an overall length of {{convert|638|ft|m|0|order=flip}} with two {{convert|97|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} spans and four {{convert|105|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} spans, and is {{convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}} between kerbs. A {{convert|5|ft|m|0|adj=mid|order=flip|spell=on|-wide}} [[footway]] has been provided for pedestrian use.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n\nEach box girder is made up of five cells each {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} wide and {{convert|3|ft|3|in|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} high. The base and walls of each cell are steel plates and the reinforced concrete deck forms the top section. A feature of the design is the cantilever construction of the girders. This allows a greater distance between piers than a simply supported span design.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n\nHay is located on the Western Plains where the clay and silt deposit can be up to {{convert|1500|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in depth. Due to the complete absence of rock in this deposit, {{convert|10|x|10|in|cm|0|order=flip}} in rolled \"H\" section steel piles have been used for the [[Foundation (construction)|foundations]]. These vary from {{convert|51|to|81|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in length.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n\n[[Coffer dam]]s of steel sheet piling were constructed in the river to enable the construction of the two pile caps and the lower portions of the two piers in the river. The steel girders were manufactured at Sydney in pairs {{convert|15|ft|m|0|order=flip}} wide, transported by road to Hay and bolted together after having been placed in position on falsework. The longest sections handled were {{convert|65|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, end to end, and each weighed {{convert|24|ST|t|0|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n\nThe bridge was designed by Gordon Bull and Associates, Consulting Engineers and was constructed by contract to and under the supervision of the Department by Central Constructions Pty Ltd of New South Wales. The approaches were designed and constructed by the Department. The total cost of the bridge and approaches was {{AUD}}890,000. The completion of this bridge by the Department, together with the channelisation of the intersection of State Highways Nos 14 and 21 immediately south of the bridge and the reconstruction of Lachlan Street, State Highway No. 21, Cobb Highway by Hay Shire Council, immediately north of the bridge, ensured a smoother flow of traffic through the town of Hay.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n\nThe bridge was opened by the Honourable [[Harry Jago]], the NSW Assistant Minister for Highways, on {{start date|1973|06|08|df=y}}, the same day as he also opened a replacement bridge across the Murrumbidgee River at {{NSWcity|Balranald}}, located {{convert|80|mi|km|0|order=flip}} west.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n{{clear}}\n== Former bridge ==\n{{Infobox bridge\n| name                = (Old) Hay Bridge\n| native_name         = \n| native_name_lang    = \n| image               = Hay Bridge over Murrumbidgee River (Leader, Melbourne, Sat 3 Oct 1908 Page 28).jpg\n| image_upright       = 1.4\n| alt                 = \n| caption             = The old Hay Bridge in 1908\n| pushpin_map         = \n| pushpin_relief      = \n| pushpin_map_size    = \n| pushpin_map_alt     = \n| pushpin_map_caption = \n| coordinates         = <!-- {{Coord}} -->\n| os_grid_reference   = \n| qid                 = \n| refs                = \n| carries             = \n| crosses             = \n| locale              = \n| starts              = \n| ends                = \n| official_name       = \n| other_name          = \n| named_for           = \n| owner               = \n| maint               = \n| heritage            = \n| id                  = \n| id_type             = \n| website             = \n| preceded            = \n| followed            = \n| design              = \n| material            = \n| material1           = \n| material2           = \n| length              = \n| width               = \n| height              = \n| depth               = \n| traversable         = \n| towpath             = \n| mainspan            = {{convert|60|ft|m|1|order=flip}}\n| number_spans        = 4\n| piers_in_water      = \n| load                = \n| clearance_above     = \n| clearance_below     = \n| lanes               = \n| life                = \n| first_length        = \n| first_diameter      = \n| second_length       = \n| second_diameter     = \n| third_length        = \n| third_diameter      = \n| capacity            = \n| num_track           = \n| track_gauge         = \n| structure_gauge     = \n| electrification     = \n| architect           = \n| designer            = \n| contracted_designer = \n| winner              = \n| engineering         = \n| builder             = \n| fabricator          = [[Peter Nicol Russell|P.
