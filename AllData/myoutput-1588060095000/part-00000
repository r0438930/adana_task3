Eventually,  both left [[Spain]] for [[Rome]]. When Sixtus became the [[Pope]] in 257, he ordained Lawrence as a [[deacon]], and though Lawrence was still young appointed him first among the seven deacons who served in the [[cathedral church]]. He is therefore called \"[[archdeacon]] of Rome\", a position of great trust that included the care of the treasury and riches of the Church and the distribution of alms to the indigent.<ref name=\"slocc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slocc.com/images/St.%20Lawrence.pdf|title=\"St. Lawrence, Deacon Martyr,\" said to have been martyred by being put on a gridiron.

After the martyr had suffered pain for a long time, the legend concludes, he cheerfully declared: \"I'm well done on this side. Turn me over!\"<ref name=SHMI /><ref name=foley/> From this St. Lawrence derives his patronage of [[cook (profession)|cooks]], [[chef]]s, and [[comedian]]s.\n\nLawrence was sentenced at [[San Lorenzo in Miranda]], imprisoned in and baptized fellow prisoners at San Lorenzo in Fonte, martyred at [[San Lorenzo in Panisperna]], and was buried in [[San Lorenzo fuori le Mura]]. The [[Chronography of 354|Almanac of Filocalus]] for 354 states that he was buried in the [[Catacomb]] of [[Cyriaca]] on the [[Via Tiburtina]]<ref name=kirsch/> by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] and [[Justin the Confessor]], a presbyter. One of the early sources for his martyrdom was the description of [[Prudentius|Aurelius Prudentius Clemens]] in his ''Peristephanon'', Hymn 2.\n[[File:Martirio di san Lorenzo - Borgianni.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''The Martyrdom of St Lawrence'' by [[Orazio Borgianni]]]]\n\nHistorian Patrick J.

[[Pope Damasus I]] rebuilt or repaired the church, now the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura]], while the Minor Basilica of [[San Lorenzo in Panisperna]] was erected over the site of his martyrdom. The gridiron of the martyrdom was placed by [[Pope Paschal II]] in the Minor Basilica of [[San Lorenzo in Lucina]].\n\n== Associated Roman churches ==\n[[File:St. Stephen the Martyr (Omaha), chapel window 4, St Lawrence.jpg|thumb|St. Lawrence in stained glass window by [[Franz Mayer & Co.]].

The earliest existing documentation of miracles associated with him is in the writings of [[Gregory of Tours]] (538\u2013594), who mentions the following:\n\n{{quote|A priest named Fr. Sanctulus was rebuilding a church of St Lawrence, which had been attacked and burnt, and hired many workmen to accomplish the job. At one point during the construction, he found himself with nothing to feed them. He prayed to St. Lawrence for help, and looking in his basket he found a fresh, white loaf of bread.

Tradition holds that annually, on the Feast of St. Lawrence, and sometimes on other occasions, the blood in the ampulla miraculously liquefies during the Feast and re-coagulates by the following day.<ref>[http://digilander.libero.it/sanlorenzoamaseno/ Parrocchia Santa Maria Assunta in Amaseno, Lazio, Italy];</ref>{{better source|again somewhat unclear|date=April 2018}}\n\n== Veneration ==\n[[File:Saint Lawrence stone.jpg|thumb|left|The stone on which St Lawrence's body was laid after death, in [[San Lorenzo fuori le mura]]]]\n\nDue to his conspiring to hide and protect the written documents of the Church, Lawrence is known as the patron saint of archivists and librarians.<ref>Owens, B. (2003). \"The safeguarding of memory: The divine function of the librarian and archivist\" . ''Library & Archival Security'', 18(1), 9\u201341</ref>\n\n=== Roman Catholic Church ===\n\nLawrence is one of the most widely venerated saints of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Legendary details of his death were known to Damasus, Prudentius, Ambrose, and Augustine. Devotion to him was widespread by the fourth century. His liturgical celebration on 10 August has the rank of [[religious festival|feast]] in the [[General Roman Calendar]], consistent with the oldest of Christian calendars, e. g. the [[Almanac of Philocalus]] for the year 354, the inventory of which contains the principal feasts of the Roman martyrs of the middle of the fourth century. He remains one of the saints enumerated in the \"Roman Canon\" of the [[Holy Mass]] as celebrated in the [[Latin Church]].\n\nLawrence is especially honoured in the city of [[Rome]], of which he is considered the '''third patron''' after [[St. Peter]] and [[St. Paul]].<ref>Parrocchia Santa Maria Assunta, Amaseno, \"I Luoghi di San Lorenzo a Roma\", [http://digilander.libero.it/sanlorenzoamaseno/], accessed 13 March 2017.</ref> The church built over his tomb, the Papal Minor [[Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura]], became one of the seven principal churches of Rome and a favourite place of Roman pilgrimages.<ref name=foley>[http://www.americancatholic.org/features/saints/saint.aspx?id=1103 Foley, OFM, Leonard, \"St. Lawrence\", ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast'' (Revised by Pat McCloskey, OFM), Franciscan Media] {{ISBN|978-0-86716-887-7}}</ref> The area proximate to the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura]] is named the \"[[Quartiere San Lorenzo]]\".\n\nBecause the [[Perseids|Perseid Meteor Shower]] typically occurs annually in mid-August on or proximate to his feast day, some refer to the shower as the \"Tears of St Lawrence\".<ref name=slocc/>\n\n[[File:san lorenzo's grill.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The shrine containing the [[Gridiron (cooking)|gridiron]] that was used to roast St Lawrence to death according to tradition is in the Church of [[San Lorenzo in Lucina]], [[Rome]].]]\n\nHis intercession to God is invoked by [[librarians]], [[archivists]], [[comedians]], [[cook (profession)|cook]]s and [[tanner (occupation)|tanner]]s as their patron. He is the [[patron saint]] of [[Ampleforth Abbey]], whose Benedictine monks founded one of the world's leading public schools for Catholics, located in [[North Yorkshire]] (North East [[England]]).\n\nOn his feast the reliquary containing his burnt head is displayed in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] ([[Basilica di San Pietro]]?) for veneration.\n\n=== Anglican Communion ===\n\nWithin Anglicanism Lawrence's name is traditionally spelled ''Laurence or Lawrence''. His feast is on 10 August which is in the calendar of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', the volume of prayers which, in its 1662 format, was the founding liturgical document of a majority of Anglican provinces. In the ''Book of Common Prayer'' the feast is titled \"S Laurence, Archdeacon of Rome and Martyr\". His feast on 10 August has been carried into the contemporary calendars of most Anglican provinces,<ref>See, for example, \"An Anglican Prayer Book\" (1989), the Province of Southern Africa, published by Collins Liturgical,  {{ISBN|0 00 599180 3}}, Calendar, page 24.</ref> including the [[Church of England]],<ref>See \"Common Worship\" (2000) core edition, published by Church House Publishing, {{ISBN|0 7151 2000 X}}, Calendar, page 12.</ref> which designates it as a lesser festival under the title \"Laurence, deacon, martyr, 258\".\n\n[[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]] venerate Lawrence, who is the patron of many Anglican parish churches, including 228 in [[England]].<ref>''The Oxford Dictionary of Saints'', published by Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0 19 283069 4}} (paperback), cites 228 churches.</ref><ref>The Church of England official index ([http://www.achurchnearyou.com ACNY]) cites 224 spelt \"Lawrence\" and \"Laurence\".</ref> A major church in [[Sydney]], Australia, in the former civil parish of St Laurence, is known as \"[[Christ Church St Laurence]]\". The Anglican charitable society, [[Brotherhood of St Laurence]] also bears his name.\n\n== Legacy ==\nAccording to Francesco Moraglia the role of [[deacon]] is distinguished by service of the poor. He is destined both to the service of the table ([[Works_of_mercy#Corporal_works_of_mercy|corporal works of mercy]]) and to the service of the word ([[Works_of_mercy#Spiritual_works_of_mercy|spiritual works of mercy]]). \"The beauty, power and the heroism of [d]eacons such as Lawrence help to discover and come to a deeper meaning of the special nature of the diaconal ministry.\"<ref name=moraglia/>\n[[File:El Escorial View from the north-west.jpg|thumb|[[El Escorial]], near Madrid, laid out in a grid pattern resembling a gridiron.]]\n\nMany churches, schools, parishes, towns, and geographic features throughout the world are named for Lawrence of Rome. Depending on locality they are named ''St. Lawrence'', ''St. Laurence'', ''San Lorenzo'', ''St. Laurent'', ''St. Lorenz'' or similarly in other languages. [[El Escorial|San Lorenzo del Escorial]], the [[monastery]] built by King [[Philip II of Spain]], commemorates his victory at the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)]] on the Feast of St. Lawrence.<ref name=\"Fodor's Review 2008\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/spain/madrid/review-101150.html|title=Real Monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial|author=Fodor's Review|year=2008}}</ref> The monastery and the attached palace, college, and library are laid out in a grid pattern that resembles the gridiron of Lawrence's martyrdom. The gridiron of Lawrence is also thought the basis of the design of the [[Certosa di Padula|Certosa di San Lorenzo di Padula]], which is a monastery in [[Padula]], [[Province of Salerno|Salerno]], [[Italy]]. Two universities bear his name: [[St. Lawrence University]] (non-Catholic) in [[Canton, St. Lawrence County]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]], and [[St. Lawrence University (Uganda)|St. Lawrence University]] in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]].\n\nOn his second voyage, French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]], arriving in the river [[estuary]] of the [[Great Lakes|North American Great Lakes]] on the Feast of St. Lawrence in 1535, named it the ''[[Gulf of St. Lawrence]]''.<ref>\n{{cite book | last= Johnson | first= William Henry | title= French Pathfinders in North America | publisher= Gutenberg.org | date= 20 May 2007 | url= http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21543/ | accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref>\nThe river emptying into the gulf was named the ''[[St. Lawrence River]]''. Many names in what are now [[Qu\u00e9bec]] and the [[Maritime Provinces]] of [[Canada]] are references to this important seaway, e. g., the ''[[Laurentian mountains]]'' north of the city of [[Montreal]], [[Saint-Laurent (borough)]], [[Saint Lawrence Boulevard]] which spans the width of the [[Island of Montreal]], and [[St. Lawrence County, New York]], [[United States]] near [[Lake Ontario]].\n\nThe rescue operation for the miners trapped in the [[2010 Copiap\u00f3 mining accident]] in [[Chile]] was named ''Operac\u00edon San Lorenzo'' after Lawrence, patron saint of miners.<ref>[http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/09/09/faith-plays-key-role-for-trapped-chilean-miners-families/ Oppman, Patrick. \"Faith plays key role for trapped Chilean miners, families\", CNN, September 9th, 2010]</ref>\n\nIn [[Freemasonry]] the ''Order of St. Lawrence the Martyr'' is a masonic degree whose ritual is based upon the story of Lawrence.

(2003). \"The safeguarding of memory: The divine function of the librarian and archivist\" . ''Library & Archival Security'', 18(1), 9\u201341</ref>\n\n=== Roman Catholic Church ===\n\nLawrence is one of the most widely venerated saints of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Legendary details of his death were known to Damasus, Prudentius, Ambrose, and Augustine. Devotion to him was widespread by the fourth century. His liturgical celebration on 10 August has the rank of [[religious festival|feast]] in the [[General Roman Calendar]], consistent with the oldest of Christian calendars, e. g. the [[Almanac of Philocalus]] for the year 354, the inventory of which contains the principal feasts of the Roman martyrs of the middle of the fourth century. He remains one of the saints enumerated in the \"Roman Canon\" of the [[Holy Mass]] as celebrated in the [[Latin Church]].\n\nLawrence is especially honoured in the city of [[Rome]], of which he is considered the '''third patron''' after [[St. Peter]] and [[St. Paul]].<ref>Parrocchia Santa Maria Assunta, Amaseno, \"I Luoghi di San Lorenzo a Roma\", [http://digilander.libero.it/sanlorenzoamaseno/], accessed 13 March 2017.</ref> The church built over his tomb, the Papal Minor [[Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura]], became one of the seven principal churches of Rome and a favourite place of Roman pilgrimages.<ref name=foley>[http://www.americancatholic.org/features/saints/saint.aspx?id=1103 Foley, OFM, Leonard, \"St. Lawrence\", ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast'' (Revised by Pat McCloskey, OFM), Franciscan Media] {{ISBN|978-0-86716-887-7}}</ref> The area proximate to the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura]] is named the \"[[Quartiere San Lorenzo]]\".\n\nBecause the [[Perseids|Perseid Meteor Shower]] typically occurs annually in mid-August on or proximate to his feast day, some refer to the shower as the \"Tears of St Lawrence\".<ref name=slocc/>\n\n[[File:san lorenzo's grill.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The shrine containing the [[Gridiron (cooking)|gridiron]] that was used to roast St Lawrence to death according to tradition is in the Church of [[San Lorenzo in Lucina]], [[Rome]].]]\n\nHis intercession to God is invoked by [[librarians]], [[archivists]], [[comedians]], [[cook (profession)|cook]]s and [[tanner (occupation)|tanner]]s as their patron. He is the [[patron saint]] of [[Ampleforth Abbey]], whose Benedictine monks founded one of the world's leading public schools for Catholics, located in [[North Yorkshire]] (North East [[England]]).\n\nOn his feast the reliquary containing his burnt head is displayed in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] ([[Basilica di San Pietro]]?) for veneration.\n\n=== Anglican Communion ===\n\nWithin Anglicanism Lawrence's name is traditionally spelled ''Laurence or Lawrence''. His feast is on 10 August which is in the calendar of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', the volume of prayers which, in its 1662 format, was the founding liturgical document of a majority of Anglican provinces. In the ''Book of Common Prayer'' the feast is titled \"S Laurence, Archdeacon of Rome and Martyr\". His feast on 10 August has been carried into the contemporary calendars of most Anglican provinces,<ref>See, for example, \"An Anglican Prayer Book\" (1989), the Province of Southern Africa, published by Collins Liturgical,  {{ISBN|0 00 599180 3}}, Calendar, page 24.</ref> including the [[Church of England]],<ref>See \"Common Worship\" (2000) core edition, published by Church House Publishing, {{ISBN|0 7151 2000 X}}, Calendar, page 12.</ref> which designates it as a lesser festival under the title \"Laurence, deacon, martyr, 258\".\n\n[[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]] venerate Lawrence, who is the patron of many Anglican parish churches, including 228 in [[England]].<ref>''The Oxford Dictionary of Saints'', published by Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0 19 283069 4}} (paperback), cites 228 churches.</ref><ref>The Church of England official index ([http://www.achurchnearyou.com ACNY]) cites 224 spelt \"Lawrence\" and \"Laurence\".</ref> A major church in [[Sydney]], Australia, in the former civil parish of St Laurence, is known as \"[[Christ Church St Laurence]]\". The Anglican charitable society, [[Brotherhood of St Laurence]] also bears his name.\n\n== Legacy ==\nAccording to Francesco Moraglia the role of [[deacon]] is distinguished by service of the poor. He is destined both to the service of the table ([[Works_of_mercy#Corporal_works_of_mercy|corporal works of mercy]]) and to the service of the word ([[Works_of_mercy#Spiritual_works_of_mercy|spiritual works of mercy]]). \"The beauty, power and the heroism of [d]eacons such as Lawrence help to discover and come to a deeper meaning of the special nature of the diaconal ministry.\"<ref name=moraglia/>\n[[File:El Escorial View from the north-west.jpg|thumb|[[El Escorial]], near Madrid, laid out in a grid pattern resembling a gridiron.]]\n\nMany churches, schools, parishes, towns, and geographic features throughout the world are named for Lawrence of Rome.
