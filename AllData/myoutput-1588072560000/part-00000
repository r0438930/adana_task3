This completely new port north of Gdansk was established on territory awarded in 1919.

In 1945, the city officially became part of Poland in accordance with the [[Potsdam Agreement]]. In the period immediately after the war, many surviving Germans [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|were expelled]] to [[West Germany|West]] or [[East Germany]], while members of the pre-war Polish ethnic minority started returning and as new Polish settlers began to come. Due to these events, Gda\u0144sk suffered severe [[underpopulation]] and did not recover until the late 1950s.\n\n==Establishment==\n\n===Periods of independence and autonomy===\n\nDanzig had an early history of independence. It was a leading player in the [[Prussian Confederation]] directed against the [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Monastic State of Prussia]]. The Confederation stipulated with the Polish king, [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], that the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish Crown]] would be invested with the role of head of state of western parts of Prussia ([[Royal Prussia]]). In contrast, [[Ducal Prussia]] remained a Polish fief. Danzig and other cities such as [[Elbl\u0105g|Elbing]] and [[Toru\u0144|Thorn]] financed most of the warfare and enjoyed a high level of city autonomy. Danzig used the title ''Royal Polish City of Danzig''.\n\nIn 1569, when Royal Prussia's [[estates of the realm|estates]] agreed to incorporate the region into the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the city insisted on preserving its special status. It defended itself through the costly [[Siege of Danzig (1577)|Siege of Danzig]] in 1577 in order to preserve special privileges, and subsequently insisted on negotiating by sending emissaries directly to the Polish king.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Danzig's location as a deep-water port where the [[Vistula river]] met the Baltic Sea had made it into one of the wealthiest cities in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries as grain from Poland and the Ukraine was shipped up the Vistula on barges to be loaded onto ships in Danzig, where it was shipped on to western Europe.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 211\">Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 211</ref> As many of the merchants shipping the grain from Danzig were Dutch, who built Dutch-style houses for themselves, leading to other Danzigers imitating them, the city was thus given a distinctively Dutch appearance.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 211\"/> Danzig become known as \"the Amsterdam of the East\", a wealthy seaport and trading crossroads that linked together the economics of western and eastern Europe, and whose location at where the Vistula flowed into the Baltic led to various powers competing to rule the city.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 211\"/>\n\nAlthough Danzig became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793, Prussia was conquered by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1806, and in September 1807 Napoleon declared Danzig a semi-independent [[client state]] of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]], known as the [[Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic)|Free City of Danzig]]. It lasted seven years, until it was re-incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1814, after Napoleon's defeat at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] ([[Battle of Nations]]) by a coalition that included Russia, Austria, and Prussia. The city remained part of Prussia until 1920, becoming part of the ''Reich'' in 1871.\n\nPoint 14 of U.S. president [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]] called for Polish independence to be restored and for Poland to have \"secure access to the sea\", a promise that implied that Danzig which occupied a strategic location where the Vistula river flowed into the Baltic sea, should become part of Poland.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 211\"/> At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, the Polish delegation led by [[Roman Dmowski]] asked for Wilson to honor point 14 of the 14 Points by transferring Danzig to Poland, arguing that Poland would not be economically viable without Danzig and that since the city had been part of Poland until 1793, it was rightfully part of Poland anyway.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 211.</ref> However, Wilson had promised that national self-determination would be the basis of the Treaty of Versailles. As 90% of the people in Danzig in this period were German, the Allied leaders at the Paris Peace Conference compromised by creating the Free City of Danzig, a city-state in which Poland had certain special rights.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 218\">Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 218.</ref> It was felt that including a city that was 90% German into Poland would be a violation of the principle of national self-determination, but at the same time the promise in the 14 Points of allowing Poland \"secure access to the sea\" gave Poland a claim on Danzig, hence the compromise of the Free City of Danzig.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 218\"/>\n\nThe Free City of Danzig was largely the work of British diplomacy as both the French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson supported the Polish claim to Danzig, and it was only objections from the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] that prevented Danzig from going to Poland.<ref name=\"Rothwell, Victor pages 106-107\">Rothwell, Victor ''The Origins of the Second World War'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001 pages 106-107.</ref> Despite creating the Free City, the British did not really believe in the viability of the Free City of Danzig with Lloyd George writing at the time: \"France would tomorrow fight for Alsace if her right to it were contested. But would we make war for Danzig?\".<ref name=\"Rothwell, Victor pages 106-107\"/> The Foreign Secretary [[Arthur Balfour]] wrote in the summer of 1918 that the Germans had such a ferocious contempt for Poles that it was unwise for Germany to lose any territory to Poland even if morally justified as the Germans would never accept losing land to the despised Poles and such a situation was bound to cause a war.<ref name=\"Rothwell, Victor page 11\">Rothwell, Victor ''The Origins of the Second World War'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001 page 11.</ref> During the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, the British consistently sought to minimize German territorial losses to Poland under the grounds that the Germans had such an utter contempt for the Poles together with the rest of the Slavic peoples that such losses were bound to deeply wound their feelings and cause a war.<ref name=\"Rothwell, Victor page 11\"/> For all the bitterness of the [[French\u2013German enmity]], the Germans had a certain grudging respect for the French that did not extend to the Poles at all. During the Paris Peace Conference, a commission of inquiry chaired by a British historian, [[James Headlam-Morley]], investigating where the borders between Germany and Poland should be, started to research Danzig's history.<ref name=\"Overy, Richard page 2\">Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew ''The Road to War'', Random House: London 2009 page 2.</ref> Upon discovering that Danzig had been a Free City in the past, Headlam-Morley came up with what he regarded as a brilliant compromise solution under which Danzig would become a Free City again that would belong to neither Germany nor Poland.<ref name=\"Overy, Richard page 2\"/> As the British were opposed to Danzig becoming part of Poland and the French and the Americans to Danzig remaining part of Germany, Headlam-Morley's compromise of the Free City of Danzig was embraced.<ref name=\"Overy, Richard page 2\"/>\n\nThe rural areas around Danzig were overwhelmingly Polish and the representatives of the Polish farmers around Danzig complained about being included in the Free City of Danzig, stating they wanted to join Poland.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>{{quotation needed|date=December 2018}} For their part, the representatives of the German population of Danzig complained about being severed from Germany, and constantly demanded that the Free City of Danzig be reincorporated into the ''Reich''.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 219\">Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 219.</ref> The Canadian historian [[Margaret MacMillan]] wrote that a sense of Danzig national identity never emerged during the Free City's existence, and the German population of Danzig always regarded themselves as Germans who had been unjustly taken out of Germany.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 219\"/> The loss of Danzig did indeed deeply hurt German national pride and in the interwar period, German nationalists spoke of the \"open wound in the east\" that was the Free City of Danzig.<ref name=\"Overy, Richard page 16\">Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew ''The Road to War'', Random House: London 2009 page 16.</ref> However, until the building of [[Gdynia]], almost all of Poland's exports went through Danzig, and Polish public opinion was opposed to Germany having a \"choke-hold\" on the Polish economy.<ref>Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew ''The Road to War'', Random House: London 2009 page 3.</ref>\n\n===Territory===\n{{CSS image crop|Image = DAN-57-Bank von Danzig-1,000 Gulden (1924).jpg|bSize = 233|cWidth = 230|cHeight = 128|oTop = 2|oLeft = 2|Description=<center>1,000 [[Danzig gulden]] (1924) depicting City Hall</center>}}\nThe Free City of Danzig (1920\u201339) included the city of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk), the towns of [[Sopot|Zoppot (Sopot)]], [[Oliwa|Oliva (Oliwa)]], [[Nowy Dw\u00f3r Gda\u0144ski|Tiegenhof (Nowy Dw\u00f3r Gda\u0144ski)]], [[Nowy Staw|Neuteich (Nowy Staw)]] and some 252 villages and 63 [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]], covering a total area of 1,966 square kilometers ({{nowrap|759 sq mi}}).

This included the Polish congregations of the United Evangelical Church in Poland in the homonymous [[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia]] and the German congregations in the [[West Prussia (region)|West Prussia governorate]]. Danzig's consistory functioned as an executive body for that region. With the flight and expulsion of most ethnically German Protestant parishioners from the area of the Free City of Danzig between 1945 and 1948, the congregations vanished.\n\nIn March 1945, the consistory had relocated to [[L\u00fcbeck]] and opened a refugee centre for Danzigers (Hilfsstelle beim evangelischen Konsistorium Danzig) led by Upper Consistorial Councillor {{ill|Gerhard M. G\u00fclzow|de}}.

Moreover, the comparatively few Danzig Jews were offered easier refuge in safe countries because of favorable Free City migration quotas.\n\nAfter the anti-Jewish riots of [[Kristallnacht]] of 9/10 November 1938 in Germany, similar riots took place on 12/13 November in Danzig.<ref name=\"Sodeikat\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/heftarchiv/1966_2_2_sodeikat.pdf |title=Der Nationalsozialismus und die Danziger Opposition |first1=Ernst |last1=Sodeikat |publisher=[[Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte]] |year=1966 |isbn= |page=139 ff |language=German}}</ref><ref name=\"TYM\">{{cite book |author2=Vivian B.

issue.<ref name=\"Overy, Richard page 16\" /> Besides for the possibility of a revolution in Poland overthrowing the ''Sanation'' regime should Danzig be allowed to return to Germany, Beck as part of his plans for a \"Third Europe\" (i.e. a block of Eastern European states under Polish leadership) had sought to develop economic relations with Sweden and Finland.<ref name=\"Prazmowska pages

told the Danzig government the ''Reich'' would carry out a policy to the ''Zerm\u00fcrbungspolitik'' (point of destruction) towards Poland, saying a compromise solution was not wanted, and on 5 April 1939 told [[Hans-Adolf von Moltke]] under no conditions was he to negotiate with the Poles.<ref>Weinberg Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany : Starting World War II 1937\u201339'',

\"guarantee\".<ref name=\"Overy, Richard page 16\"/> In April 1939, High Commissioner Burckhardt was told by the Polish Commissioner-General that any attempt to alter its status would be answered with armed resistance on the part of Poland.<ref>Woodward, E.L., Butler, Rohan, Orde, Anne, editors, ''Documents on British Foreign Policy 1919\u20131939'', 3rd series, vol.v, [[HMSO]], London,

embracing Britain, France, the Soviet Union and a number of other European states such as Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey with the aim of \"containing\" Germany.\n\nBeck made it clear that he wanted no Polish-Soviet treaty to go along with the British-inspired \"peace front\" since an alliance with the Soviets would rule out any possibility of a settlement with Germany, which he still had hopes of reaching.<ref name=\"Prazmowska pages 155-164\"/> Beck declined to have Polish diplomats take part in the talks between British, French and Soviet diplomats about having the Soviet Union join the \"peace front\", and during a visit to London in April 1939 he declined British offers to create a military alliance of Britain, Poland and Romania designed to block the ''Reich'''s offers to expand its influence in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Prazmowska pages 155-164\"/> The Polish historian Anita Prazmowska wrote that Beck's refusal of the British offers of assistance was partly due to his \"inflated sense of self-importance and the general overestimation of Poland's military potential\" as he believed that Poland was one of the world's great powers that could defeat Germany on its own, but also due to his desire not have Poland join the anti-German \"peace front\" at a time when he still believed that he could settle the Danzig issue.<ref name=\"Prazmowska pages 155-164\"/> During his visit to London on 4\u20136 April 1939 Beck told Chamberlain that any effort to include the Soviet Union in the \"peace front\" would cause the very war it was supposed to prevent, and wanted to exclude the Soviet Union from the \"peace front\" for that reason.<ref>Weinberg Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany : Starting World War II 1937\u201339'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 556.</ref> Before the Danzig crisis, the Polish General Staff had devoted far more time to planning a possible war with the Soviet Union rather than with Germany, and even after the Danzig crisis began, planning for a possible war with Germany went about in a rather haphazard and causal manner suggesting the Polish high command did not see war with Germany as very likely in 1939.<ref>Prazmowska, Anita ''Britain, Poland and the Eastern Front, 1939'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004 pages 90-92.</ref> On 5 May 1939, Beck in a speech broadcast on Polish radio stated that Poland wanted peace but that \"peace...has its price, high but definable. We in Poland do not recognize the conception of peace at any price. There is only one thing..which is without price, and that is honor\".<ref>Wandycz, Piotr \"Poland and the Origins of the Second World War\" pages 374-393 from ''The Origins of the Second World War'' edited by Frank McDonough, London: Continuum, 2011 page 388.</ref>\n\nAll through the spring and summer of 1939 there was a massive media campaign in Germany demanding the immediate return of the Free City of Danzig to Germany under the slogan \"Home to the ''Reich''!\". However, the Danzig crisis was a just a pretext for war. Ribbentrop ordered Count [[Hans-Adolf von Moltke]], the German ambassador to Poland, not to negotiate with the Poles over Danzig as it was always Ribbentrop's great fear that the Poles might actually agree to the Free City returning to Germany, thereby depriving the ''Reich'' out of its pretext for attacking Poland.<ref>Weinberg Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany : Starting World War II 1937\u201339'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 pages 560\u2013562 & 583\u2013584</ref>  However, the German propaganda that all the ''Reich'' wanted was to bring Danzig home did some effect abroad. In April 1943, when mass grave of the Polish officers massacred by the NKVD in Katyn Wood was discovered, the Canadian Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] wrote in his diary that it was the Poles who caused the outbreak of the war in 1939 by refusing to give in to Hitler's demand that Danzig be allowed to rejoin Germany, and as such it was the Poles' own fault for the Katyn Wood massacre and everything else they had suffered since 1939.<ref name=\"Rothwell, Victor page 108\">Rothwell, Victor ''The Origins of the Second World War'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001 page 108.</ref> The British historian Victor Rothwell described King's view that the Poles had caused their own suffering as one motivated by spite and his resentment at being pressured by public opinion into declaring war on Germany despite his own inclinations towards neutrality.<ref name=\"Rothwell, Victor page 108\"/> From distant New Zealand, the Prime Minister [[Michael Joseph Savage]] offered to return New Zealand Samoa, which had once been the colony of German Samoa together with the rest of the former German islands in the Pacific held by New Zealand, in exchange for Germany promising not to use violence to alter the status of Danzig.<ref name=\"Rothwell, Victor page 108\"/>\n\nHowever, in 1938, the ''Reich'' government had first demanded autonomy for the Sudetenland region and after Prague had conceded the demand for autonomy, had laid claim to the Sudetenland. On 15 March 1939, Germany had occupied the Czech part of Czecho-Slovakia, which had done immense damage to Hitler's claim that he was only trying to undo an \"unjust\" Treaty of Versailles by bringing all of the ethnic Germans \"home to the ''Reich''\". The British Foreign Secretary [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] late in August 1939 told [[Herbert von Dirksen]], the German ambassador in London:<blockquote>\u201cLast year the German government put forward the demand for the Sudetenland on purely racial grounds; but subsequent events proved that this demand was only put forward as a cover for the annihilation of Czechoslovakia. In view of this experience\u2026 it is not surprising that the Poles and we ourselves are afraid that the demand for Danzig is only a first move towards the destruction of Poland\u2019s independence\u201d.<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II'' University of Chicago Press: Chicago, 1980 page 348.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTensions escalated into the [[Danzig crisis]] during the summer of 1939.

This completely new port north of Gdansk was established on territory awarded in 1919.

In 1945, the city officially became part of Poland in accordance with the [[Potsdam Agreement]]. In the period immediately after the war, many surviving Germans [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|were expelled]] to [[West Germany|West]] or [[East Germany]], while members of the pre-war Polish ethnic minority started returning and as new Polish settlers began to come. Due to these events, Gda\u0144sk suffered severe [[underpopulation]] and did not recover until the late 1950s.\n\n==Establishment==\n\n===Periods of independence and autonomy===\n\nDanzig had an early history of independence. It was a leading player in the [[Prussian Confederation]] directed against the [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Monastic State of Prussia]]. The Confederation stipulated with the Polish king, [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], that the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish Crown]] would be invested with the role of head of state of western parts of Prussia ([[Royal Prussia]]). In contrast, [[Ducal Prussia]] remained a Polish fief. Danzig and other cities such as [[Elbl\u0105g|Elbing]] and [[Toru\u0144|Thorn]] financed most of the warfare and enjoyed a high level of city autonomy. Danzig used the title ''Royal Polish City of Danzig''.\n\nIn 1569, when Royal Prussia's [[estates of the realm|estates]] agreed to incorporate the region into the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the city insisted on preserving its special status. It defended itself through the costly [[Siege of Danzig (1577)|Siege of Danzig]] in 1577 in order to preserve special privileges, and subsequently insisted on negotiating by sending emissaries directly to the Polish king.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Danzig's location as a deep-water port where the [[Vistula river]] met the Baltic Sea had made it into one of the wealthiest cities in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries as grain from Poland and the Ukraine was shipped up the Vistula on barges to be loaded onto ships in Danzig, where it was shipped on to western Europe.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 211\">Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 211</ref> As many of the merchants shipping the grain from Danzig were Dutch, who built Dutch-style houses for themselves, leading to other Danzigers imitating them, the city was thus given a distinctively Dutch appearance.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 211\"/> Danzig become known as \"the Amsterdam of the East\", a wealthy seaport and trading crossroads that linked together the economics of western and eastern Europe, and whose location at where the Vistula flowed into the Baltic led to various powers competing to rule the city.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 211\"/>\n\nAlthough Danzig became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793, Prussia was conquered by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1806, and in September 1807 Napoleon declared Danzig a semi-independent [[client state]] of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]], known as the [[Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic)|Free City of Danzig]]. It lasted seven years, until it was re-incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1814, after Napoleon's defeat at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] ([[Battle of Nations]]) by a coalition that included Russia, Austria, and Prussia. The city remained part of Prussia until 1920, becoming part of the ''Reich'' in 1871.\n\nPoint 14 of U.S. president [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]] called for Polish independence to be restored and for Poland to have \"secure access to the sea\", a promise that implied that Danzig which occupied a strategic location where the Vistula river flowed into the Baltic sea, should become part of Poland.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 211\"/> At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, the Polish delegation led by [[Roman Dmowski]] asked for Wilson to honor point 14 of the 14 Points by transferring Danzig to Poland, arguing that Poland would not be economically viable without Danzig and that since the city had been part of Poland until 1793, it was rightfully part of Poland anyway.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 211.</ref> However, Wilson had promised that national self-determination would be the basis of the Treaty of Versailles. As 90% of the people in Danzig in this period were German, the Allied leaders at the Paris Peace Conference compromised by creating the Free City of Danzig, a city-state in which Poland had certain special rights.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 218\">Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 218.</ref> It was felt that including a city that was 90% German into Poland would be a violation of the principle of national self-determination, but at the same time the promise in the 14 Points of allowing Poland \"secure access to the sea\" gave Poland a claim on Danzig, hence the compromise of the Free City of Danzig.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 218\"/>\n\nThe Free City of Danzig was largely the work of British diplomacy as both the French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson supported the Polish claim to Danzig, and it was only objections from the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] that prevented Danzig from going to Poland.<ref name=\"Rothwell, Victor pages 106-107\">Rothwell, Victor ''The Origins of the Second World War'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001 pages 106-107.</ref> Despite creating the Free City, the British did not really believe in the viability of the Free City of Danzig with Lloyd George writing at the time: \"France would tomorrow fight for Alsace if her right to it were contested. But would we make war for Danzig?\".<ref name=\"Rothwell, Victor pages 106-107\"/> The Foreign Secretary [[Arthur Balfour]] wrote in the summer of 1918 that the Germans had such a ferocious contempt for Poles that it was unwise for Germany to lose any territory to Poland even if morally justified as the Germans would never accept losing land to the despised Poles and such a situation was bound to cause a war.<ref name=\"Rothwell, Victor page 11\">Rothwell, Victor ''The Origins of the Second World War'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001 page 11.</ref> During the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, the British consistently sought to minimize German territorial losses to Poland under the grounds that the Germans had such an utter contempt for the Poles together with the rest of the Slavic peoples that such losses were bound to deeply wound their feelings and cause a war.<ref name=\"Rothwell, Victor page 11\"/> For all the bitterness of the [[French\u2013German enmity]], the Germans had a certain grudging respect for the French that did not extend to the Poles at all. During the Paris Peace Conference, a commission of inquiry chaired by a British historian, [[James Headlam-Morley]], investigating where the borders between Germany and Poland should be, started to research Danzig's history.<ref name=\"Overy, Richard page 2\">Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew ''The Road to War'', Random House: London 2009 page 2.</ref> Upon discovering that Danzig had been a Free City in the past, Headlam-Morley came up with what he regarded as a brilliant compromise solution under which Danzig would become a Free City again that would belong to neither Germany nor Poland.<ref name=\"Overy, Richard page 2\"/> As the British were opposed to Danzig becoming part of Poland and the French and the Americans to Danzig remaining part of Germany, Headlam-Morley's compromise of the Free City of Danzing was embraced.<ref name=\"Overy, Richard page 2\"/>\n\nThe rural areas around Danzig were overwhelmingly Polish and the representatives of the Polish farmers around Danzig complained about being included in the Free City of Danzig, stating they wanted to join Poland.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>{{quotation needed|date=December 2018}} For their part, the representatives of the German population of Danzig complained about being severed from Germany, and constantly demanded that the Free City of Danzig be reincorporated into the ''Reich''.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 219\">Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 219.</ref> The Canadian historian [[Margaret MacMillan]] wrote that a sense of Danzig national identity never emerged during the Free City's existence, and the German population of Danzig always regarded themselves as Germans who had been unjustly taken out of Germany.<ref name=\"Macmillan, Margaret page 219\"/> The loss of Danzig did indeed deeply hurt German national pride and in the interwar period, German nationalists spoke of the \"open wound in the east\" that was the Free City of Danzig.<ref name=\"Overy, Richard page 16\">Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew ''The Road to War'', Random House: London 2009 page 16.</ref> However, until the building of [[Gdynia]], almost all of Poland's exports went through Danzig, and Polish public opinion was opposed to Germany having a \"choke-hold\" on the Polish economy.<ref>Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew ''The Road to War'', Random House: London 2009 page 3.</ref>\n\n===Territory===\n{{CSS image crop|Image = DAN-57-Bank von Danzig-1,000 Gulden (1924).jpg|bSize = 233|cWidth = 230|cHeight = 128|oTop = 2|oLeft = 2|Description=<center>1,000 [[Danzig gulden]] (1924) depicting City Hall</center>}}\nThe Free City of Danzig (1920\u201339) included the city of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk), the towns of [[Sopot|Zoppot (Sopot)]], [[Oliwa|Oliva (Oliwa)]], [[Nowy Dw\u00f3r Gda\u0144ski|Tiegenhof (Nowy Dw\u00f3r Gda\u0144ski)]], [[Nowy Staw|Neuteich (Nowy Staw)]] and some 252 villages and 63 [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]], covering a total area of 1,966 square kilometers ({{nowrap|759 sq mi}}).

This included the Polish congregations of the United Evangelical Church in Poland in the homonymous [[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia]] and the German congregations in the [[West Prussia (region)|West Prussia governorate]]. Danzig's consistory functioned as an executive body for that region. With the flight and expulsion of most ethnically German Protestant parishioners from the area of the Free City of Danzig between 1945 and 1948, the congregations vanished.\n\nIn March 1945, the consistory had relocated to [[L\u00fcbeck]] and opened a refugee centre for Danzigers (Hilfsstelle beim evangelischen Konsistorium Danzig) led by Upper Consistorial Councillor {{ill|Gerhard M. G\u00fclzow|de}}. The Lutheran congregation of [[St. Mary's Church, Gda\u0144sk|St. Mary's Church]] could relocate its valuable [[parament]] collection and the [[presbyterian polity|presbytery]] granted it on loan to [[St. Anne's Museum Quarter, L\u00fcbeck#Chamber of paraments|St. Annen Museum]] in L\u00fcbeck after the war. Other Lutheran congregations of Danzig could reclaim their church bells, which the [[Wehrmacht]] had requisitioned as non-ferrous metal for war purposes since 1940, but which had survived, not yet melted down, in storage (e.g. {{ill|Glockenfriedhof|de}}) in the British zone of occupation. The presbyteries granted them usually to Northwestern German Lutheran congregations which had lost bells due to the war.\n\n====Diocese of Danzig of the Roman Catholic Church====\n{{main|Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gda\u0144sk#history|l1=Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gda\u0144sk}}\n[[File:Archikatedra Oliwska 01.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Oliwa Cathedral|Archcathedral of the Holy Trinity, Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Bernard]] in Oliva, Danzig]]\nThe 36 Catholic [[parish]]es in the territory of the Free City in 1922 used to belong in equal shares to the [[Bishopric of Culm (Che\u0142mno)|Diocese of Culm]], which was mostly Polish, and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Warmia|Diocese of Ermland]], which was mostly German.

Danzig became a venue for international meetings of Jewish organisations, such as the convention of delegates from Jewish youth organisations of various nations, attended by [[David Ben-Gurion]], which founded the [[World Union of Jewish Youth]] on 2 September 1924 in the Sch\u00fctzenhaus venue. On 21 March 1926 the ''Zionistische Organisation f\u00fcr Danzig'' convened delegates of [[Hechalutz]] from all over for the first conference in Danzig using [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as common language, also attended by Ben Gurion.\n\nWith a Nazi majority in the Volkstag and Senate, anti-Semitic persecution and discrimination occurred unsanctioned by the authorities. In contrast to Germany, which exercised capital outflow control since 1931, emigration of Danzig's Jews was nonetheless somewhat easier, with capital transfers enabled by the Bank of Danzig. Moreover, the comparatively few Danzig Jews were offered easier refuge in safe countries because of favorable Free City migration quotas.\n\nAfter the anti-Jewish riots of [[Kristallnacht]] of 9/10 November 1938 in Germany, similar riots took place on 12/13 November in Danzig.<ref name=\"Sodeikat\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/heftarchiv/1966_2_2_sodeikat.pdf |title=Der Nationalsozialismus und die Danziger Opposition |first1=Ernst |last1=Sodeikat |publisher=[[Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte]] |year=1966 |isbn= |page=139 ff |language=German}}</ref><ref name=\"TYM\">{{cite book |author2=Vivian B.

issue.<ref name=\"Overy, Richard page 16\" /> Besides for the possibility of a revolution in Poland overthrowing the ''Sanation'' regime should Danzig be allowed to return to Germany, Beck as part of his plans for a \"Third Europe\" (i.e. a block of Eastern European states under Polish leadership) had sought to develop economic relations with Sweden and Finland.<ref name=\"Prazmowska pages

told the Danzig government the ''Reich'' would carry out a policy to the ''Zerm\u00fcrbungspolitik'' (point of destruction) towards Poland, saying a compromise solution was not wanted, and on 5 April

\"guarantee\".<ref name=\"Overy, Richard page 16\"/> In April 1939, High Commissioner Burckhardt was told by the Polish Commissioner-General that any attempt to alter its status would be answered with armed resistance on the part of Poland.<ref>Woodward, E.L., Butler, Rohan, Orde, Anne, editors, ''Documents on British Foreign Policy 1919\u20131939'', 3rd series, vol.v, [[HMSO]], London,

embracing Britain, France, the Soviet Union and a number of other European states such as Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey with the aim of \"containing\" Germany.\n\nBeck made it clear that he wanted no Polish-Soviet treaty to go along with the British-inspired \"peace front\" since an alliance with the Soviets would rule out any possibility of a settlement with Germany, which he still had hopes of reaching.<ref name=\"Prazmowska pages 155-164\"/> Beck declined to have Polish diplomats take part in the talks between British, French and Soviet diplomats about having the Soviet Union join the \"peace front\", and during a visit to London in April 1939 he declined British offers to create a military alliance of Britain, Poland and Romania designed to block the ''Reich'''s offers to expand its influence in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Prazmowska pages 155-164\"/> The Polish historian Anita Prazmowska wrote that Beck's refusal of the British offers of assistance was partly due to his \"inflated sense of self-importance and the general overestimation of Poland's military potential\" as he believed that Poland was one of the world's great powers that could defeat Germany on its own, but also due to his desire not have Poland join the anti-German \"peace front\" at a time when he still believed that he could settle the Danzig issue.<ref name=\"Prazmowska pages 155-164\"/> During his visit to London on 4\u20136 April 1939 Beck told Chamberlain that any effort to include the Soviet Union in the \"peace front\" would cause the very war it was supposed to prevent, and wanted to exclude the Soviet Union from the \"peace front\" for that reason.<ref>Weinberg Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany : Starting World War II 1937\u201339'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 556.</ref> Before the Danzig crisis, the Polish General Staff had devoted far more time to planning a possible war with the Soviet Union rather than with Germany, and even after the Danzig crisis began, planning for a possible war with Germany went about in a rather haphazard and causal manner suggesting the Polish high command did not see war with Germany as very likely in 1939.<ref>Prazmowska, Anita ''Britain, Poland and the Eastern Front, 1939'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004 pages 90-92.</ref> On 5 May 1939, Beck in a speech broadcast on Polish radio stated that Poland wanted peace but that \"peace...has its price, high but definable. We in Poland do not recognize the conception of peace at any price. There is only one thing..which is without price, and that is honor\".<ref>Wandycz, Piotr \"Poland and the Origins of the Second World War\" pages 374-393 from ''The Origins of the Second World War'' edited by Frank McDonough, London: Continuum, 2011 page 388.</ref>\n\nAll through the spring and summer of 1939 there was a massive media campaign in Germany demanding the immediate return of the Free City of Danzig to Germany under the slogan \"Home to the ''Reich''!\". However, the Danzig crisis was a just a pretext for war. Ribbentrop ordered Count [[Hans-Adolf von Moltke]], the German ambassador to Poland, not to negotiate with the Poles over Danzig as it was always Ribbentrop's great fear that the Poles might actually agree to the Free City returning to Germany, thereby depriving the ''Reich'' out of its pretext for attacking Poland.<ref>Weinberg Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany : Starting World War II 1937\u201339'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 pages 560\u2013562 & 583\u2013584</ref>  However, the German propaganda that all the ''Reich'' wanted was to bring Danzig home did some effect abroad. In April 1943, when mass grave of the Polish officers massacred by the NKVD in Katyn Wood was discovered, the Canadian Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] wrote in his diary that it was the Poles who caused the outbreak of the war in 1939 by refusing to give in to Hitler's demand that Danzig be allowed to rejoin Germany, and as such it was the Poles' own fault for the Katyn Wood massacre and everything else they had suffered since 1939.<ref name=\"Rothwell, Victor page 108\">Rothwell, Victor ''The Origins of the Second World War'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001 page 108.</ref> The British historian Victor Rothwell described King's view that the Poles had caused their own suffering as one motivated by spite and his resentment at being pressured by public opinion into declaring war on Germany despite his own inclinations towards neutrality.<ref name=\"Rothwell, Victor page 108\"/> From distant New Zealand, the Prime Minister [[Michael Joseph Savage]] offered to return New Zealand Samoa, which had once been the colony of German Samoa together with the rest of the former German islands in the Pacific held by New Zealand, in exchange for Germany promising not to use violence to alter the status of Danzig.<ref name=\"Rothwell, Victor page 108\"/>\n\nHowever, in 1938, the ''Reich'' government had first demanded autonomy for the Sudetenland region and after Prague had conceded the demand for autonomy, had laid claim to the Sudetenland. On 15 March 1939, Germany had occupied the Czech part of Czecho-Slovakia, which had done immense damage to Hitler's claim that he was only trying to undo an \"unjust\" Treaty of Versailles by bringing all of the ethnic Germans \"home to the ''Reich''\". The British Foreign Secretary [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] late in August 1939 told [[Herbert von Dirksen]], the German ambassador in London:<blockquote>\u201cLast year the German government put forward the demand for the Sudetenland on purely racial grounds; but subsequent events proved that this demand was only put forward as a cover for the annihilation of Czechoslovakia. In view of this experience\u2026 it is not surprising that the Poles and we ourselves are afraid that the demand for Danzig is only a first move towards the destruction of Poland\u2019s independence\u201d.<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II'' University of Chicago Press: Chicago, 1980 page 348.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTensions escalated into the [[Danzig crisis]] during the summer of 1939.

About 20,000 Germans left on their own and by late 1945 between 10,0000 and 15,000 pre-war inhabitants remained.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gdansk.pl/wiadomosci/maj-1945-i-pozniej-tak-narodzil-sie-polski-gdansk-rozmowa,a,113891 |title=Wiosna 1945 - czas, gdy rodzi\u0142 si\u0119 polski Gda\u0144sk |first=Sylwia |last=Bykowska |date=13 May 2018 |publisher= City of Gda\u0144sk|language=Polish}}</ref>\nBy 1950, around 285,000 fled and expelled citizens of the former Free City were living in Germany,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and 13,424 citizens of the former Free City had been \"verified\" and granted Polish citizenship.<ref name=\"BIPN\">{{cite journal |last=Bykowska |first=Sylwia |year=2005 |title=Gda\u0144sk&nbsp;\u2013 Miasto (Szybko) Odzyskane |journal=Biuletyn Instytutu Pami\u0119ci Narodowej |volume=9\u201310 |issue=56\u201357 |pages=35\u201344 |issn=1641-9561 |url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/pl/24/1363/ |language=Polish |accessdate=2009-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022223440/http://ipn.gov.pl/portal/pl/24/1363/ |archive-date=2007-10-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By 1947, 126,472 Danzigers of German ethnicity were expelled to Germany from Gda\u0144sk, and 101,873 Poles from Central Poland and 26,629 from [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-annexed Eastern Poland took their place (these figures refer to the [[Gda\u0144sk|city of Gda\u0144sk]] itself, not to the whole area of pre-war Free City).<ref name=\"BIPN\"/>\n\n=== Origin of the post-war population ===\nDuring the Polish post-war census of December 1950, data about the pre-war places of residence of the inhabitants as of August 1939 was collected. In case of children born between September 1939 and December 1950, their origin was reported based on the pre-war places of residence of their mothers. Thanks to this data it is possible to reconstruct the pre-war geographical origin of the post-war population.

Another 25% came from neighbouring areas of [[Pomeranian Voivodeship (1919\u20131939)|pre-war Polish Pomerania]]. Almost 20% were Poles from areas of [[Kresy|former Eastern Poland]] annexed by the USSR (many from [[Wilno Voivodeship (1926\u20131939)|Wilno Voivodeship]]). Several percent came from the city of Warsaw, which had been [[Warsaw Uprising|largely destroyed in 1944]].\n\n==In fiction==\nHistorical Danzig forms the setting for several major works of [[Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[G\u00fcnter Grass]], including his acclaimed [[Danzig Trilogy]] novels ''[[The Tin Drum]]'', ''[[Cat and Mouse (novella)|Cat and Mouse]]'' and ''[[Dog Years (novel)|Dog Years]]'', as well as in his memoirs.
