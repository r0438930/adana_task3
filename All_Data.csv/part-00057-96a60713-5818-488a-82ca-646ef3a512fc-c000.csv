'''''C! True Hollywood Stories''''' is the third studio album by the [[rapper]] [[Canibus]], released through Archives Music on October 30, 2001. The album is Canibus' first release on an [[independent record label]] (his first two albums, ''[[Can-I-Bus]]'' and ''[[2000 B.C. (album)|2000 B.C.]]'', were released on [[Universal Records]]). The album was named after the television show ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]''. This album sets itself apart from his first two albums by seemingly being a concept album, some songs rapped from the perspective of Stan, the fan from the [[Eminem]] song \"[[Stan (song)|Stan]]\". It can also be noted Canibus' rhyme style and flow resemble more that of Eminem than the style presented on his first two albums, which led to mixed reviews from the public.

''C! True Hollywood Stories'' garnered mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critic]]s. Wise Q of ''[[HipHopDX]]'' said that despite the album's lack of engaging topics and powerful beats, he gave credit to tracks like \"Hate U 2/Luv U 2\", \"I Gotta Story 2 Tell\" and \"The Rip Off\" for finding that right merger of ingredients, concluding that \"Lyrically, he is still the top of the field and, with the right feedback and right amount of work, Canibus will be able to receive the respect he deserves.\"<ref name=\"HHDX\"/> Brad Mills of [[AllMusic]] was ambivalent towards the album, admiring the chill vibe used throughout but found the video games beats not working half the time with Canibus' battle flow, concluding that \"If you're a die-hard fan, don't expect the MC murderer listeners have grown used to, but don't completely write it off either.

== Plot ==
===First story arc===
The first four issues of the series focuses on Daniel Llanso. His story is set some 400 years in the future in an apocalyptic world some time after Armageddon where the Devil Phlegethonyarre has his servant, Abaddon the Angel of the Bottomless Pit and their Undead Army of Nightmares (Necro-Soldiers, Zombies powered by Hell's Darklight) dominate and hunt all humans.<ref name=\"McElroyWood1999\">{{cite book|last1=McElroy|first1=Alan|last2=Wood|first2=Ashley|authorlink2=Ashley Wood|title=Spawn: Blood and Salvation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rEcIAAAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Image Comics|isbn=978-1-58240-114-0|page=2}}</ref>

Daniel's life was an abusive one for the young man: he killed his abusive/drunken father with a laser rifle in order to protect his mother and sister, Madrid. He consequently spends most of his teen years and a portion of his 20s in various prison facilities on the Moons of Mars and Earth. During his time behind bars, he falls in love with a female Public Defender named \"Mrs. Noon,\" with whom he has a strong but short love, as she is apparently killed because of him for an unknown reason. Daniel's memories of his past are mostly filled with pain and anger, of being shocked with tazer-prods in prison or murdering a Crater-Gang thug by smashing the face-mask of his spacesuit with a rock. At some point Daniel Llanso escapes from a lunar prison in a stolen freighter, but as the story points out, the cargo on board was 'Fetid' or, more likely, booby-trapped. Daniel Llanso dies as his spaceship burns up in the Earth's atmosphere; his space suit melts and his flesh burns. He screams as his soul falls burning into the darkness of damnation ending deep within the Twelfth Level of Hell.

Having died and resurrected as a [[Hellspawn (Spawn)|Hellspawn]], Daniel is at first lost in a blur of treacherous memory and whispers to do evil deeds and use his energy to violent ends. The Hellspawn rises from the barren earth just in time to stop a large demon from killing his sister and her son Matthew. Daniel instantly recognizes her, but not his nephew. She then fires her Energy rifle at the Hellspawn as Madrid and Matt escape. Spawn is left alone only to be 'found' by Abaddon who goads Spawn to kill the last humans on Earth. Spawn agrees. 

The forces of evil, now gathered within Vatican City, are led by the \"Anti-Pope\", who summons a demon named Bune to attack a human stronghold, while Abaddon goads Spawn to kill human soldiers and become Hell's General. Daniel resists at every turn, remembering the promise he made the last time he saw his sister alive: to never give up on himself. Abaddon reveals to Spawn that the Anti-Pope has already sent Death to claim Madrid and Matt, Spawn removes his mask and sees what he has become in a pool of water. In a moment of anger, he is confronted by his master Phlegethonyarre who admits to Daniel that his fate was sealed from the beginning and using his new necro powers consumes a part of his soul. The hellspawn Daniel races against time to rescue Madrid and her son Matt from an army of 'Navkies'(undead children) under the command of Bune. Phlegethonyarre gloats to Abaddon that once Spawn kills Madrid & Matthew the REAL Game can begin.

The story arc during Curse of the Spawn ends on a cliffhanger. Daniel rescues his sister yet discovers that Matthew was kidnapped by Abaddon and taken to \"The Tower\". Spawn battles Bune and ultimately kills him with his own scythe. Spawn races to the top of the tower only to find Abaddon waiting, preparing Matthew for a demonic sacrifice. Abaddon gives Spawn the chance to 'save' Matt's soul by killing him so he'll go to heaven (though this is probably a lie); instead, Spawn talks to Matt and tells him to picture the place he most wants to be, teleporting Matt back to his mother, who flee while Spawn confronts Abaddon. Spawn and Abaddon battle and Spawn appears to win by using his Darklight energy to completely destroy the tower and Abaddon in one huge blast.

Daniel, Madrid, Matthew and a few other minor characterss survive the end of the story arc.
The story concludes in its own miniseries called ''Spawn: Blood & Salvation''.

===Issues 5-29===
The rest of the ''Curse of the Spawn'' issues focuses around related characters from the main ''Spawn'' series, like [[Jessica Priest]], [[Sam and Twitch]], [[Abdiel|The Angel Abdiel]] and [[Angela (comics)|Angela]], Hatchet a Zombie Spawn, and other tales of other hell throughout the comics timelines.

Some of these stories include; An angel named Abdiel sent to spy on Malebolgia is tricked and banished from heaven, A Greek boy named Raenius, who was killed by Zeus (the god) and resurrected as a Hellspawn, who kills [[Zeus]] with the [[gorgon]] [[Medusa]] by his side.

== Plot ==
===First story arc===
The first four issues of the series focuses on Daniel Llanso. His story is set some 400 years in the future in an apocalyptic world some time after Armageddon where the Devil Phlegethonyarre has his servant, Abaddon the Angel of the Bottomless Pit and their Undead Army of Nightmares (Necro-Soldiers, Zombies powered by Hell's Darklight) dominate and hunt all humans.<ref name=\"McElroyWood1999\">{{cite book|last1=McElroy|first1=Alan|last2=Wood|first2=Ashley|authorlink2=Ashley Wood|title=Spawn: Blood and Salvation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rEcIAAAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Image Comics|isbn=978-1-58240-114-0|page=2}}</ref>

Daniel's life was an abusive one for the young man: he killed his abusive/drunken father with a laser rifle in order to protect his mother and sister, Madrid. He consequently spends most of his teen years and a portion of his 20s in various prison facilities on the Moons of Mars and Earth. During his time behind bars, he falls in love with a female Public Defender named \"Mrs. Noon,\" with whom he has a strong but short love, as she is apparently killed because of him for an unknown reason. Daniel's memories of his past are mostly filled with pain and anger, of being shocked with tazer-prods in prison or murdering a Crater-Gang thug by smashing the face-mask of his spacesuit with a rock. At some point Daniel Llanso escapes from a lunar prison in a stolen freighter, but as the story points out, the cargo on board was 'Fetid' or, more likely, booby-trapped. Daniel Llanso dies as his spaceship burns up in the Earth's atmosphere; his space suit melts and his flesh burns. He screams as his soul falls burning into the darkness of damnation ending deep within the Twelfth Level of Hell.

Having died and resurrected as a [[Hellspawn (Spawn)|Hellspawn]], Daniel is at first lost in a blur of treacherous memory and whispers to do evil deeds and use his energy to violent ends. The Hellspawn rises from the barren earth just in time to stop a large demon from killing his sister and her son Matthew. Daniel instantly recognizes her, but not his nephew. She then fires her Energy rifle at the Hellspawn as Madrid and Matt escape. Spawn is left alone only to be 'found' by Abaddon who goads Spawn to kill the last humans on Earth. Spawn agrees. 

The forces of evil, now gathered within Vatican City, are led by the \"Anti-Pope\", who summons a demon named Bune to attack a human stronghold, while Abaddon goads Spawn to kill human soldiers and become Hell's General. Daniel resists at every turn, remembering the promise he made the last time he saw his sister alive: to never give up on himself. Abaddon reveals to Spawn that the Anti-Pope has already sent Death to claim Madrid and Matt, Spawn removes his mask and sees what he has become in a pool of water. In a moment of anger, he is confronted by his master Phlegethonyarre who admits to Daniel that his fate was sealed from the beginning and using his new necro powers consumes a part of his soul. The hellspawn Daniel races against time to rescue Madrid and her son Matt from an army of 'Navkies'(undead children) under the command of Bune. Phlegethonyarre gloats to Abaddon that once Spawn kills Madrid & Matthew the REAL Game can begin.

The story arc during Curse of the Spawn ends on a cliffhanger. Daniel rescues his sister yet discovers that Matthew was kidnapped by Abaddon and taken to \"The Tower\". Spawn battles Bune and ultimately kills him with his own scythe. Spawn races to the top of the tower only to find Abaddon waiting, preparing Matthew for a demonic sacrifice. Abaddon gives Spawn the chance to 'save' Matt's soul by killing him so he'll go to heaven (though this is probably a lie); instead, Spawn talks to Matt and tells him to picture the place he most wants to be, teleporting Matt back to his mother, who flee while Spawn confronts Abaddon. Spawn and Abaddon battle and Spawn appears to win by using his Darklight energy to completely destroy the tower and Abaddon in one huge blast.

Daniel, Madrid, Matthew and a few other minor characterss survive the end of the story arc.
The story concludes in its own miniseries called ''Spawn: Blood & Salvation''.

===Issues 5-29===
The rest of the ''Curse of the Spawn'' issues focuses around related characters from the main ''Spawn'' series, like [[Jessica Priest]], [[Sam and Twitch]], [[Abdiel|The Angel Abdiel]] and [[Angela (comics)|Angela]], Hatchet a Zombie Spawn, and other tales of other hell throughout the comics timelines.

Some of these stories include; An angel named Abdiel sent to spy on Malebolgia is tricked and banished from heaven, A Greek boy named Raenius, who was killed by Zeus (the god) and resurrected as a Hellspawn, who kills [[Zeus]] with the [[gorgon]] [[Medusa]] by his side.

'''Des Raj Goyal''' (1929-2013), also known as '''Desraj Goyal''' or '''D. R. Goyal''', is an Indian journalist, academic and a well-known author of books on [[secularism in India|secularism]] and [[communalism (South Asia)|communalism]].  Having been a member of the [[Hindutva|Hindu nationalist]] organisation [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) in his younger days, he wrote a seminal book on the organisation in 1979, which is widely cited in academic works.<ref name=Raina>

== Life and career ==
Des Raj Goyal was born in 1929 in [[Moga, Punjab|Moga]], [[Panjab region|Panjab]].

Goyal became a member of the RSS in 1942, when he was still a school student.  He joined it with the belief that it was an organisation fighting for India's independence and worked as a full-time [[pracharak]]. He subsequently got disillusioned with the organisation and left it in 1947.  He continued with his interest in the organisation at an analytical level and published a book on it in 1979, which is considered authentic by academics.<ref name=converting>

</ref>

Goyal started working as a journalist since 1946, associated with several publications, including the Urdu weekly ''Sandesh'', Urdu daily ''Sangram'' and Hindu daily ''Milap''.  While working at ''Milap'', he was told by acquaintances in the ''Hindu Mahasabha Bhawan'' in Delhi to go to Gandhi's prayer meeting on 30 January 1948 because \"something historic was to happen.\"  By the time he reached the meeting, Gandhi had already been [[assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|assassinated]]. Subsequently, Goyal was arrested on suspicion of involvement in a conspiracy to assassinate [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].  While in prison, he read various books borrowed from the prison library, which broadened his horizons and helped him get out of the indoctrination he has had from the RSS.  Determined to find an organisation different from the RSS but opposed to the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], he joined the [[Communist Party of India]].<ref name=communal/>

Goyal worked as a lecturer at the [[Kirori Mal College]] of the [[Delhi University]] between 1956 and 1963.<ref name=Goyal>

</ref>

He was led to renew activism after noting the diatribes of [[M. S. Golwalkar]] against Nehru after the 1962 [[India-China War]].  He found it odd that Golwalkar had no issues with keeping aloof from the freedom struggle but was now prone to equate anti-Nehruism with patriotism.
Jointly with [[Subhadra Joshi]], Member of Parliament from [[Jabalpur]], he co-founded the organisation ''Sampradayikta Virodhi Committee'' (Anti-sectarian committee), which was later renamed to ''Qaumi Ekta Trust'' (National unity trust).  It focuses on inter-faith dialogue and communal harmony in India and publishes the ''Seculary Democracy'' magazine. Goyal was the editor of the ''Mainstream Weekly'' from 1963 to 1967 and the editor of
''Secular Democracy'' since 1968.<ref name=communal/><ref name=converting/><ref name=hardnews>

==Geography==
Located in the central part of the county, it borders the following townships:
*[[Brunswick Hills Township, Medina County, Ohio|Brunswick Hills Township]] - north
*[[Hinckley Township, Medina County, Ohio|Hinckley Township]] - northeast corner
*[[Granger Township, Medina County, Ohio|Granger Township]] - east

*[[York Township, Medina County, Ohio|York Township]] - west
*[[Liverpool Township, Medina County, Ohio|Liverpool Township]] - northwest corner

The City of Medina, the County seat, borders the Township to the southwest.

==Name and history==
The township derives its name from [[Medina]], in Arabia. The original name for the Township was to be Mecca, but was changed after a dispute among early settlers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n203 204]}}</ref> It is the only Medina Township statewide.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Detailed map of Ohio| publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]]| year = 2000| url = http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/general_ref/cousub_outline/cen2k_pgsz/oh_cosub.pdf| accessdate =2007-02-16}}</ref> The Township is attributed as being the oldest organized government in Medina County. Land from the Township was given to create the City of Medina in 1818.

== Business and Community ==
Medina Township is home to over 480 businesses that operate within the township. These businesses range from construction companies to law firms and fast food. These businesses help build a bustling economy. While it is often stated the Township is a \"Bedroom Community\", since 2007, more than 125 new businesses have opened their doors within the Township.

The Township has multiple community areas including Blakeslee Sports Complex, two cemeteries, and plans to build a community park. Among that the Township was one of the Top 100 Safest Communities in Ohio according to SafeWise.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.safewise.com/blog/safest-cities-ohio/ |website=SafeWise|title=Ohio's 20 Safest Cities of 2019|date=February 2019}}</ref> The community is also home to the Masonic Community which houses senior citizens and hosts numerous social events.

==Government==
The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.

The Township employs its own police force and contracts with the [[Medina, Ohio|City of Medina]] for Fire and EMS services. The Township is also in charge of maintaining and operating four cemeteries. These cemeteries are: Weymouth, Hamilton Corners, Remsen, and Medina Center Cemetery. The only operational cemetery is Medina Center Cemetery.

'''Alenka Sottler''' (born 24 October 1958) is a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[painting|painter]] and [[illustrator]]. She lives and works in Ljubljana as a freelance illustrator and is a member of New York Society of Illustrators. She has illustrated over 50 books for children and adults, for which she received numerous awards and honours including her second nomination for the [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] in 2014.<ref>[http://www.jakrs.si/fileadmin/user_upload/Brosure_in_katalogi/slo_best_for_young_readers_2010_1.pdf Slovenia's Best for Young Readers by the [[Slovenian Book Agency]]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203214650/http://www.jakrs.si/fileadmin/user_upload/Brosure_in_katalogi/slo_best_for_young_readers_2010_1.pdf |date=2013-02-03 }}</ref>

== Life and career ==
Alenka Sottler was born in [[Ljubljana]], the capital city of [[Slovenia]]. Her father, [[Gorazd Sotler]], was a sculptor, a pupil of the prominent Croatian sculptor [[Antun Augustinčić|Antun Augustinčič]] and her mother worked for Slovenia's leading newspaper and printing company, [[Delo (newspaper)|Delo]]. Alenka received her first informal training in drawing and sculpture in her father's studio. She studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Ljubljana (1976–1981) and successfully finished her postgraduate study in painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Ljubljana in 1983. From 1988, she works as freelance painter/ illustrator for the best Slovene and foreign publishers and magazines, including Mladinska knjiga, the largest and leading Slovene publisher. In 2011, she was awarded the title of Assistant Professor of Painting by the University of Ljubljana.

She has illustrated more than 50 books and produced many illustrations for children's magazines. An important part of her output is devoted to fairytales, both modern ([[Oscar Wilde]], [[Svetlana Makarovič]]) and classic (Folk Tales from Around the World, [[Brothers Grimm]]). Her black-white illustrations for Folk Tales from Around the World signalled her mastery and a number of awards followed. Her work is inventive, visually appealing and drawn with faultless confidence. She is contemporary in style but also well-versed in the history of visual imagery and the imagery of power, meaning and clarity. In recent years she has mainly illustrated poetry and fairytales and made original graphics/engravings for collections of poems by [[Malcolm de Chazal]], and works on paper inspired by literature and poetry.

Today, she lives and works in Ljubljana.

'''Magic Mountain''' was a theme park in [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]], a beachside suburb of [[Adelaide]], South Australia. It opened in December 1982 and closed on 18 July 2004.

Magic Mountain was popular among the young and \"young at heart\", but had also been criticised for its design, which was likened to a \"giant dog dropping\".<ref name=\"farewell\">[http://www.news.com.au/mercury/story/0,22884,20390694-421,00.html Farewell Magic Mountain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714020406/http://www.news.com.au/mercury/story/0%2C22884%2C20390694-421%2C00.html |date=14 July 2009 }}, ''891 ABC Adelaide'', 18 July 2004</ref> It was [[demolished]] amid controversy late in 2004 as part of the final stage of the Holdfast Shores development and replaced by [[The Beachouse]] in 2006.

==Operation==
Magic Mountain was popular more with locals than [[tourists]], and especially with younger people.

The main attraction of Magic Mountain was its four [[water slide]]s, particularly during the hot Adelaide summers.
(These were accessible on Level 2 of the facility. They were also the largest water slide setup in the southern hemisphere at the time.)

==Currency==

To reduce the risk of stolen money from customers (many children), Magic Mountain took a page from Disney's book and made their own tokens for all of the attractions in the buildings. No matter which machine, One Token equalled One Game.

([[Dazzeland]] and [[Downtown (disambiguation)#Places|Downtown]] also made their own tokens.)

Each token was similar to Australian $1 coins, one side showing the Magic Mountain logo, surrounded by both ''\"NO CASH VALUE\"'' above and the year of use below. The other side either had a sponsor's logo (e.g.: [[Coca-Cola]]) or ''\"NO CASH VALUE\"'' in big font around a logo shaped like [[South Australia]] labelled ''\"SA\"''.

==Closure and demolition==
Demolition of Magic Mountain was part of the second stage of the Holdfast Shores development, and was required in order to maintain the stipulated amount of open space. The plan, signed in 1997, included a profit-sharing agreement between the [[Government of South Australia|state government]] and the Holdfast Shores consortium, and a separate agreement concerning public infrastructure with the local government (the [[City of Holdfast Bay]]).

Stage 1 saw the construction of the marina, the Marina Pier and two apartment blocks. The second stage was construction of the Pier Hotel. Agreements changed before Stage 2 began. The state government withdrew from the now-considered risky hotel development and sold the land to the consortium. The plan also changed, with the separation of the hotel from the Platinum Apartments – the new plan became known as Stage 2B.

Meanwhile, a public-opinion survey in the lead-up to the May 2003 local government elections caused the council to rethink its support of the new plan. Their new-found opposition to the proposed beachfront high-rise apartments focused on Magic Mountain as the one parcel of land within the project that was under their control.<ref name=\"cracks\">[http://www.adelaidereview.com.au/archives/2004_02/issuesandopinion_story1.shtml Cracks in the plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823010151/http://www.adelaidereview.com.au/archives/2004_02/issuesandopinion_story1.shtml |date=23 August 2006 }}, ''The Adelaide Review'', February 2004</ref>

==Description and history==
The Thurgood Marshall Center is located on the west side of 12th Street NW, between S and T Streets.  It is a large rectangular four-story masonry building, built out of red brick with trim of limestone and gray brick.  Its main facade is three bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by a Tuscan portico with entablature, modillioned cornice, and low balustrade above.  The ground floor is finished in bands of gray brick arranged to appear as rough stone, while the upper floors are red brick with gray brick corner quoining. Limestone stringcourses serve as a water table between the basement and first floor, between the first and second floors, and above the top floor.  The building is crowned by a modillioned and dentillated cornice and a low balustrade.  Windows are set in pairs in each bay, with limestone keystones.<ref name=\"nrhpinv2\"/>

The international YMCA was founded in Great Britain in 1844, and its first American branch opened in 1851.  [[Anthony Bowen]] founded the first African-American branch of the organization in 1853 in Washington, one year after a branch for whites was opened in the city.  The organization struggled financially in its early years, and was not formally incorporated until 1892.  The organization moved into its first permanent home on 11th Street in 1891, which it soon had sell due to declining membership.  After a membership drive revitalized the organization, it secured a pledge from [[John D. Rockefeller Sr.]] of $25,000, which was matched by fundraising from across the nation's African-American community.  It is believed to be the first such campaign of its type in that community.  This building was completed in 1912 to a design by African-American architect [[William Sidney Pittman]].<ref name=\"nrhpinv2\"/>

In 1973 Twelfth Street YMCA was officially renamed Anthony Bowen YMCA in honor of its founder.  It closed in 1982, suffering from declining membership and mounting building maintenance costs.<ref name=\"nrhpinv2\"/>  After undergoing restoration, it reopened in 2000 as the Thurgood Marshall Community Center.

You go to college; you wake up {{sic|ev|eryday}} and mow the lawn; and go to work for eight or nine hours a day. We didn't want to do that. We wanted to say that you don't have to do what everyone else does. It was an eerie picture, like it was straight out of ''American Beauty''. So we thought it was cool to have on the front.\"<ref>{{cite news | first = C. | last = Bottomley | title = Trapt: Face Forward | date = 2004-04-19 | publisher = [[MTV]] | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1486446/trapt-face-forward.jhtml | work = mtv.com | accessdate = 2013-06-24}}{{dead link|date=September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Rousseau |first=Caryn |url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/20040520/News/305209952 |title=Trapt’s lead singer surprises parents, maybe even himself |work=South Coast Today |date=2004-05-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115192231/http://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/20040520/News/305209952 |archivedate=2018-01-15 |accessdate=2018-01-15 }}</ref>

'''The Jim Jones Revue''' were an English [[garage rock|garage]] [[rock and roll]] band composed of Jim Jones, Rupert Orton, Henri Herbert, Gavin Jay and Nick Jones.

==History==

The band was formed after Jim Jones met Rupert Orton ([[Beth Orton]]'s brother) at his ''Not The Same Old Blues Crap'' club night in London.<ref name=\"Catchpole\">{{cite news|last=Catchpole|first=Chris |title=Blood And Guts And Rock N Roll|work=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|issue=203|date=October 2010|pages=49–51}}</ref> In 2008, the band recorded their self-titled debut album in just 48 hours, in a rehearsal space in [[Camden Town]], London.<ref name=\"Catchpole\"/> The album was released on 8 September 2008 via Punk Rock Blues Records.

A collection of singles and B-sides entitled ''Here To Save Your Soul'' was released on 5 October 2009.

The band then recorded their second album, ''Burning Your House Down'', which was produced by [[Jim Sclavunos]] of [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]] and [[Grinderman]]. In interview Jim Jones has explained that they also chose Sclavunos for his work with bands like [[Sonic Youth]] and [[The Cramps]].<ref name =\"Jones\">{{cite web|url=https://tech.blorge.com/2011/08/30/burning-your-stereo-down-an-interview-with-the-jim-jones-revue/77467 |title=Burning Your Stereo Down - an interview with The Jim Jones Revue|work=Blorge|date=30 August 2011|accessdate=4 February 2018|archivedate=5 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205023038/https://tech.blorge.com/2011/08/30/burning-your-stereo-down-an-interview-with-the-jim-jones-revue/77467}}</ref> This second album was released on 16 August 2011 through Punk Rock Blues Records / [[PIAS Recordings]].

On 2 September 2010, the band previewed ''Burning Your House Down'' at London nightclub Madame Jojo's in front of a sold-out audience, which included [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] singer [[Liam Gallagher]] as well as members of Grinderman and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.<ref name=\"Marszalek\">{{cite web|last=Marszalek|first=Julian|url=http://www.spinnermusic.co.uk/2010/09/03/jim-jones-revue-london-show/ |title=The Jim Jones Revue Preview New Album In London|work=[[Spinner (website)|Spinner]]|date=3 September 2010 |accessdate=4 February 2018|archivedate=28 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728100825/http://www.spinnermusic.co.uk/2010/09/03/jim-jones-revue-london-show/}}</ref>

They appeared on the ''Late Show with David Letterman'' (CBS-TV) on 7 September 2011.

The band released their third album ''The Savage Heart'' on 12 October 2012 through Punk Rock Blues Records / [[PIAS Recordings]].

The band pianist, Henri Herbert, put on an impromptu performance on a public piano at St. Pancras International train station, London.  The video was uploaded on 6 July 2013 and has since gone viral, receiving more than 19,000,000 views.

In June 2014 the band announced that they would cease performing and recording in October 2014 after their \"Last Hurrah\" tour.

Jim Jones has since been leading [[Jim Jones and The Righteous Mind]].

The [[BBC]]'s Johnny Sharp wrote that the band's  \"string-shredding guitar, furiously chattering piano and blistering, blustery rhythm\" meant that \"you’re bombarded with sonic viscera\".<ref name=\"Sharp\">Sharp, Johnny (2010) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/9gx2 \"Blues Rock Renegades rip the genre a new orifice\"] ''[[BBC Online]]'', accessed online on 03.09.10</ref>

In reference to the band's second album, ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' Michael Hann said that, \"''Burning Your House Down'' sounds like a gangfight set to 12-bar blues\" and that \"The Jim Jones Revue imagine that rock'n'roll didn't really need to evolve after 1956; it just needed to get much, much louder, and wildly more distorted\".<ref name=\"Hann\"/>

'''The Jim Jones Revue''' were an English [[garage rock|garage]] [[rock and roll]] band composed of Jim Jones, Rupert Orton, Henri Herbert, Gavin Jay and Nick Jones.

==History==

The band was formed after Jim Jones met Rupert Orton ([[Beth Orton]]'s brother) at his ''Not The Same Old Blues Crap'' club night in London.<ref name=\"Catchpole\">{{cite news|last=Catchpole|first=Chris |title=Blood And Guts And Rock N Roll|work=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|issue=203|date=October 2010|pages=49-51}}</ref> In 2008, the band recorded their self-titled debut album in just 48 hours, in a rehearsal space in [[Camden Town]], London.<ref name=\"Catchpole\"/> The album was released on 8 September 2008 via Punk Rock Blues Records.

A collection of singles and B-sides entitled ''Here To Save Your Soul'' was released on 5 October 2009.

The band then recorded their second album, ''Burning Your House Down'', which was produced by [[Jim Sclavunos]] of [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]] and [[Grinderman]]. In interview Jim Jones has explained that they also chose Sclavunos for his work with bands like [[Sonic Youth]] and [[The Cramps]].<ref name =\"Jones\">{{cite web|url=https://tech.blorge.com/2011/08/30/burning-your-stereo-down-an-interview-with-the-jim-jones-revue/77467 |title=Burning Your Stereo Down - an interview with The Jim Jones Revue|work=Blorge|date=30 August 2011|accessdate=4 February 2018|archivedate=5 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205023038/https://tech.blorge.com/2011/08/30/burning-your-stereo-down-an-interview-with-the-jim-jones-revue/77467}}</ref> This second album was released on 16 August 2011 through Punk Rock Blues Records / [[PIAS Recordings]].

On 2 September 2010, the band previewed ''Burning Your House Down'' at London nightclub Madame Jojo's in front of a sold-out audience, which included [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] singer [[Liam Gallagher]] as well as members of Grinderman and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.<ref name=\"Marszalek\">{{cite web|last=Marszalek|first=Julian|url=http://www.spinnermusic.co.uk/2010/09/03/jim-jones-revue-london-show/ |title=The Jim Jones Revue Preview New Album In London|work=[[Spinner (website)|Spinner]]|date=3 September 2010 |accessdate=4 February 2018|archivedate=28 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728100825/http://www.spinnermusic.co.uk/2010/09/03/jim-jones-revue-london-show/}}</ref>

They appeared on the ''Late Show with David Letterman'' (CBS-TV) on 7 September 2011.

The band released their third album ''The Savage Heart'' on 12 October 2012 through Punk Rock Blues Records / [[PIAS Recordings]].

The band pianist, Henri Herbert, put on an impromptu performance on a public piano at St. Pancras International train station, London.  The video was uploaded on 6 July 2013 and has since gone viral, receiving more than 19,000,000 views.

In June 2014 the band announced that they would cease performing and recording in October 2014 after their \"Last Hurrah\" tour.

Jim Jones has since been leading [[Jim Jones and The Righteous Mind]].

Their style has been compared to early [[rock and roll]] artists [[Little Richard]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]<ref name=\"Hann\">Hann, Michael (2010) [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/26/jim-jones-revue-burning-your-house-down-cd-review \"The Jim Jones Revue: Burning Your House Down\"], ''[[The Guardian|Guardian.co.uk]]'', accessed online on 27.08.10</ref><ref name=\"Hughes\">Hughes, Rob (2010) \"The Jim Jones Revue: Burning Your House Down\", ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock Magazine]]'', Issue 123, September 2008.</ref> as well as to [[punk rock]] bands such as [[The Stooges]], [[MC5]] and [[Motörhead]].<ref name=\"Hughes\"/><ref name=\"Jelbert\">Jelbert, Steve (2009) [http://thequietus.com/articles/03255-jim-jones-revue-here-to-save-your-soul-album-review \"Jim Jones Revue: Here To Save Your Soul\"], ''[[The Quietus]]'', accessed online on 27.08 2010</ref>

The [[BBC]]'s Johnny Sharp wrote that the band's  \"string-shredding guitar, furiously chattering piano and blistering, blustery rhythm\" meant that \"you’re bombarded with sonic viscera\".<ref name=\"Sharp\">Sharp, Johnny (2010) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/9gx2 \"Blues Rock Renegades rip the genre a new orifice\"] ''[[BBC Online]]'', accessed online on 03.09.10</ref>

In reference to the band's second album, ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' Michael Hann said that, \"''Burning Your House Down'' sounds like a gangfight set to 12-bar blues\" and that \"The Jim Jones Revue imagine that rock'n'roll didn't really need to evolve after 1956; it just needed to get much, much louder, and wildly more distorted\".<ref name=\"Hann\"/>

==World war 2==
On January 6, 1943 ''Benjamin Contee'' took part in [[Convoy#Atlantic|convoy]] ON-187, a [[Liverpool]] - [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] trip.  To support the [[Britain]], the ship operated under the [[Combined Shipping Adjustment Board]]. At the request of Britain, the Benjamin Contee was used to transport [[Italians|Italian]] [[prisoners of War]] from [[El Alamein]], [[Egypt]] to [[Oran]], [[Algeria]]. With 1800 Italian [[POW]]’s onboard and just 23 minutes out of El Alamein in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on August 16, 1943 at night she was hit by an [[aircraft]] dropped [[aerial torpedo]] 16 miles north of [[Bone, Algeria]]. The explosion killed 264 and injures 142 of the 1,800 Italian POWs on board. There were no casualties to the crew of 43 [[Merchant Marine]]s, 27 [[US Navy Armed Guard]], 26 British guards, and 7 Army security detail. It was a harrowing experience for the POWs in the [[cargo hold]]s. Many of the POWs later would join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Italian Service Units]]. The torpedo hit in cargo hold No. 1 and No. 2, which flooded quickly. The able Italian POW when to the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], but they did not know how to lower them. The Flooding of hold 1 nad 2 caused the [[bow (ship) to start to sink and [[rudder]] and [[propeller]] to rise out of the water. Cargo hold 4 and 5 were flooded so the propeller was back in the water, thus the ship could continue. 
Under her own power, she was able to continue to [[Bone, Algeria]] for temporary repairs. The ship was received permanent repairs at Gibraltar to fix the 25 by 21-foot hole in her side. After repairs, she returned to [[New York City]] and returned to [[Southhampton]].

Next on March 14, 1944 she took part in convoy SC-155 (Liverpool-Halifax). SC-155 was a convoy of slower ships, traveling at 4 knots. She joined SC-155 was she was not able to travel at she top speed of 11 knots after her damage.

==Normandy landings D-Day==
Due to ''Benjamin Contee'' damage, she was selecited to help with the [[Normandy landings]], she was used as a sea [[breakwater]] by [[scuttling]] on the 8 June 1944 in position Gooseberry No. 1 in [[Mulberry Harbour]] off of [[Utah Beach]], [[Normandy]] at the beachhead.  She was damaged more by a severe storm on 19-22 June 1944. On July 16, 1944 she was declared a complete loss and officially abandoned. Nine other ships were scuttled to from [[Mulberry_harbour#Breakwaters|Gooseberry 1]].  Some of the other ships were the''David O. Saylor'', ''George S. Wasson'', ''Matt W.

'''Mary Elizabeth  Coleridge''' (23 September 1861 – 25 August 1907) was a British [[novelist]] and [[poet]] who also wrote essays and reviews.<ref>[http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/mary_elizabeth_coleridge Mary Elizabeth Coleridge – Poems, Biography, Quotes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> She wrote poetry under the [[pseudonym]] Anodos, taken from [[George MacDonald]]; other influences on her were [[Richard Watson Dixon]] and [[Christina Rossetti]]. [[Robert Bridges]], the Poet Laureate, described her poems as 'wonderously beautiful… but mystical rather and enigmatic'.<ref>Phillips, Catherine, 'Robert Bridges' Oxford University Press, Oxford 1992 {{ISBN|0-19-212251-7}}</ref>

Mary Coleridge was <!-- born somewhere, -->the daughter of [[Arthur Coleridge|Arthur Duke Coleridge]]. With the singer [[Jenny Lind]], her father was responsible for the formation of the [[The Bach Choir|London Bach Choir]] in 1875. Other family friends included [[Robert Browning]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], [[John Millais]] and [[Fanny Kemble]]. She was the great-grandniece of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and the great niece of [[Sara Coleridge]], the author of ''Phantasmion''. 

Coleridge travelled widely throughout her life, although her home was in London, where she lived with her family. She taught at the London Working Women's College for twelve years from 1895 to 1907.

She completed five novels. Her first was ''The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus'', which [[Chatto & Windus]] published in February 1893 as by M. E. Coleridge. At least one newspaper noted it as \"a new story by Mr M. E. Coleridge\".<ref>\"Books of the Week\", ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 20 February 1893, p. 2 (no review).</ref> The story is not related to the [[Seven Sleepers of Ephesus]] legend; it features a modern Brotherhood which takes that name.<ref>{{citation|magazine=[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]|date=8 April 1893|page=302|title=New novels|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000020223694&view=1up&seq=318}}</ref> [[Edward Arnold (publisher) |Edward Arnold]] published the other four novels. The best known is ''The King with Two Faces'', which earned her £900 in royalties in 1897. 

Coleridge died of complications arising from [[appendicitis]] while on holiday in [[Harrogate]] in 1907, leaving an unfinished manuscript for her next novel and hundreds of unpublished poems.

Eight of her poems, including \"The Blue Bird\" (originally published in 1897 under the French title \"L'Oiseau Bleu\"),<ref>{{cite book |title=Fancy's Guerdon |author=Anodos |year=1897 |publisher=Elkin Mathews |location=London |url=https://archive.org/details/fancysguerdon00cole/page/26/mode/2up |page=27}} </ref> were set to music for chorus by [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], and three poems including \"Thy Hand in Mine\" were set by [[Frank Bridge]]. A family friend, the composer [[Hubert Parry]], also set several of her poems as songs for voice and piano. And [[Cyril Rootham]] (an erstwhile pupil of Stanford and Parry) set four of her poems for solo voice and orchestra, though when published in 1913 the songs were rewritten for voice and piano.

Coleridge's poetry was first published under her own name in the posthumous ''Poems'' (1908).  In the preface to this volume, [[Henry Newbolt]] wrote:<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/poemscoleridge00cole/page/n11/mode/2up |pages=v-vi |title=Poems |first=Mary E. |last=Coleridge |year=1908 |location=London |publisher=Elkin Mathews}}</ref> {{quote |As a poetess, Mary Coleridge never came before the public under her own name; her printed verse was always either anonymous or signed with the pseudonym ’Άνοδος {{--}} a name taken from George Macdonald's romance, \"Phantastes,\" where it is evidently intended to bear the meaning of \"Wanderer.\"  Probably several reasons or feelings prompted this concealment; the one by which my own arguments were always met was the fear of tarnishing the name which an ancestor had made illustrious in English poetry [...] I believe that no poems that no poems are less likely than these to jar upon lovers of \"Christabel\" and \"The Ancient Mariner.\"}}

The '''Parish Church of Our Lady of Help''' ({{lang-pt|Igreja Matriz de Nossa Senhora da Ajuda}}) is a 19th-century [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church located in [[Jaguaripe]], [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]]. The church is dedicated to [[Our Lady of Help]] and belongs to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Salvador da Bahia]].

==History==

The Parish Church of Our Lady of Help was built in the 18th century. It replaced a simple [[wattle and daub]] chapel and school built by the [[Jesuits]] in early 1700s; they arrived in present-day Jaguaripe from Salvador via [[Ilha dos Frades]]. It was renovated in the 19th century in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style, typical of church renovations in Bahia in the same century.<ref name=\"bahia\" /><ref name=\"hpip\" /><ref name=\"ipac-ba\" />

==Location==

The Parish Church of Our Lady of Help is located at the highest point of the historic center of Jaguaripe. A winding, paved street connects Largo da Matriz, the church yard, to the town hall below. The church has broad views of the small historic center of Jaguaripe, the [[Jaguaripe River]], and rolling hills of the region.<ref name=\"hpip\" /><ref name=\"ipac-ba\" />

==Structure==

The Parish Church of Our Lady of Help is constructed of lime and stone masonry and covers {{convert|1480|m2|ft2}}. The division of the plan of the church into three sections (a nave and two side corridors) is emphasized on the façade by [[pilaster]]s. The church has gable roofs, one on the central body and one over the sacristies. The façade has three portals with five windows at the choir level. Each of the windows has an arched lintel.<ref name=\"hpip\" />

The church has a single bell tower with a bulbous dome. The church has a monumental, rococo-style pediment with volutes, a stylized oculus at center, and tracings in terra-cotta painted yellow. The church has three bronze bells with heavy wooden bell yolks painted green.

The church opens to a broad church yard, now known as the Largo da Matriz. It has a concrete platform with small stair constructed in the 20th century. Two large yards are located to the sides of the church, a feature not found in other churches of the region.<ref name=\"hpip\" /><ref name=\"ipac-ba\" />

===Interior===

The interior of the church consists of a nave and side corridors surmounted by tribunes, a plan typical of Bahian churches of the 18th century. The church has two side chapels at the front of the church, one dedicated to the Blessed Sacrament. The church, somewhat unusually, has two sacristies, one on side of the chancel. The sacristies are accessed via the chancel and side chapels. The high altars and side altars are in the Neoclassical style with [[talha dourado]], or gilded wood carvings; they replace the baroque altars of the original structures. The church interior once had numerous baroque-style paintings; they were removed during renovations of the church in the 18th century. The church has numerous examples of wood carving, including those located in the chancel, tribune handrails, a screen of the side chapel dedicated to the Blessed Sacrament, the chancel, and the tribune handrail.

===Sacristies===

The sacristies of the Parish Church of Our Lady of Help retain their 18th-century appearance. They have carved rococo alterpieces, a sacristy cabinet, and built-in closets. One altar is in the style typical during the reign of [[John V of Portugal]]. Its design is based on an altar originally in the [[Monastery of St. Benedict]] in Salvador and now located in the [[Church and Monastery of Our Lady of Monserrate]]. The other is in the late Rococo style, and is similar to that found in the [[Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar]] in Salvador.<ref name=\"b\" />

==Access==

The Parish Church of Our Lady of Help is open to the public and may be visited.

The '''Parish Church of Our Lady of Help''' ({{lang-pt|Igreja Matriz de Nossa Senhora da Ajuda}}) is a 19th-century [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church located in [[Jaguaripe]], [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]]. The church is dedicated to [[Our Lady of Help]] and belongs to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Salvador da Bahia]].

==History==

The Parish Church of Our Lady of Help was built in the 18th century. It replaced a simple [[wattle and daub]] chapel and school built by the [[Jesuits]] in early 1700s; they arrived in present-day Jaguaripe from Salvador via [[Ilha dos Frades]]. It was renovated in the 19th century in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style, typical of church renovations in Bahia in the same century.<ref name=\"bahia\" /><ref name=\"hpip\" /><ref name=\"ipac-ba\" />

==Location==

The Parish Church of Our Lady of Help is located at the highest point of the historic center of Jaguaripe. A winding, paved street connects Largo da Matriz, the church yard, to the town hall below. The church has broad views of the small historic center of Jaguaripe, the [[Jaguaripe River]], and rolling hills of the region.<ref name=\"hpip\" /><ref name=\"ipac-ba\" />

==Structure==

The Parish Church of Our Lady of Help is constructed of lime and stone masonry and covers {{convert|1480|m2|ft2}}. The division of the plan of the church into three sections (a nave and two side corridors) is emphasized on the façade by [[pilaster]]s. The church has gable roofs, one on the central body and one over the sacristies. The façade has three portals with five windows at the choir level. Each of the windows has an arched lintel.<ref name=\"hpip\" />

The church has a single bell tower with a bulbous dome. The church has a monumental, rococo-style pediment with volutes, a stylized oculus at center, and tracings in terra-cotta painted yellow. The church has three bronze bells with heavy wooden bell yolks painted green.

The church opens to a broad church yard, now known as the Largo da Matriz. It has a concrete platform with small stair constructed in the 20th century. Two large yards are located to the sides of the church, a feature not found in other churches of the region.<ref name=\"hpip\" /><ref name=\"ipac-ba\" />

===Interior===

The interior of the church consists of a nave and side corridors surmounted by tribunes, a plan typical of Bahian churches of the 18th century. The church has two side chapels at the front of the church, one dedicated to the Blessed Sacrament. The church, somewhat unusually, has two sacristies, one on side of the chancel. The sacristies are accessed via the chancel and side chapels. The high altars and side altars are in the neoclassical style with [[talha dourado]], or gilded wood carvings; they replace the baroque altars of the original structures. The church interior once had numerous baroque-style paintings; they were removed during renovations of the church in the 18th century. The church has numerous examples of wood carving, including those located in the chancel, tribune handrails, a screen of the side chapel dedicated to the Blessed Sacrament, the chancel, and the tribune handrail.

===Sacristies===

The sacristies of the Parish Church of Our Lady of Help retain their 18th-century appearance. They have carved rococo alterpieces, a sacristy cabinet, and built-in closets. One altar is in the style typical during the reign of [[John V of Portugal]]. Its design is based on an altar originally in the [[Monastery of St. Benedict]] in Salvador and now located in the [[Church and Monastery of Our Lady of Monserrate]]. The other is in the late Rococo style, and is similar to that found in the [[Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar]] in Salvador.<ref name=\"b\" />

==Access==

The Parish Church of Our Lady of Help is open to the public and may be visited.

==Key contributions==

===Conway's Game of Life===
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2019}}
He became intensely interested in the [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]] shortly after [[John Horton Conway]] had proposed it.  Conway conjectured the existence of infinitely growing patterns, and offered a reward for an example. Gosper was the first to find such a pattern, the [[Gun (cellular automaton)|glider gun]], and won the prize.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Colossal Book of Mathematics |publisher=W. W. Norton |location=New York |author-first=Martin |author-last=Gardner |author-link=Martin Gardner |date=2001 |isbn=0-393-02023-1}}</ref> Gosper was also the originator of the [[Hashlife]] algorithm that can speed up the computation of Life patterns by many orders of magnitude.

===Packing problems===
Gosper has created numerous [[packing problem]] puzzles, such as \"Twubblesome Twelve\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Nested Scrolls: The Autobiography of Rudolf Von Bitter Rucker |author-first=Rudy |author-last=Rucker |author-link=Rudy Rucker |publisher=Macmillan |date=2012 |isbn=978-0-76532753-6 |page=240 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-rbwOWK4Dn8C&pg=PA240}}</ref>

===Symbolic computation===
Gosper was the first person to realize the possibilities of [[symbolic computation]] on a computer as a mathematics research tool,{{cn|date=June 2016}} whereas computer methods were previously limited to purely numerical methods. In particular, this research resulted in his work on [[continued fraction]]<ref name=\"contfrac\">{{cite web |url=https://perl.plover.com/yak/cftalk/INFO/gosper.txt |title=Continued Fraction Arithmetic |author-last=Gosper |author-first=Bill |author-link=Bill Gosper |access-date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> representations of real numbers and [[Gosper's algorithm]] for finding closed form [[Hypergeometric series|hypergeometric]] identities.

In 1985, Gosper briefly held the world record for computing the most digits of [[pi#Rapidly convergent series|pi]] with 17 million digits.<ref>{{cite book |author-last1=Arndt |author-first1=Jörg |author-last2=Haenel |author-first2=Christoph |title=Pi Unleashed |publisher=Springer-Verlag |date=2006 |isbn=978-3-540-66572-4<!--isbn only volume 1--> |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QwwcmweJCDQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |pages=104, 206}} English translation by Catriona and David Lischka. Record was in 1985.</ref> See [[chronology of computation of π]].

===Space-filling curves===
In the continuity of early 20th century examples of [[space-filling curve]]s—the Koch-Peano curve, Cesàro and [[Lévy C curve]], all special cases of the general [[de Rham curve]]—and following the path of [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], Gosper discovered the [[Peano-Gosper curve]], before engaging with variations on the [[Dragon curve|Harter-Heighway dragon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WqK4ZWbzI6M |title=Plane-Filling Functions vs. Space-Filling Curves |author-last=Gosper |author-first=Bill |author-link=Bill Gosper |access-date=November 1, 2019}}</ref> In the late 80s, Gosper independently discovered the [[Gosper-Lafitte triangle]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Distribution of nonempty triangles inside a fractal rep-4-tile|encyclopedia=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences |date=1995 |url=https://oeis.org/A000360}}</ref>

Gosper has created numerous [[packing problem]] puzzles, such as \"Twubblesome Twelve\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Nested Scrolls: The Autobiography of Rudolf Von Bitter Rucker |author-first=Rudy |author-last=Rucker |author-link=Rudy Rucker |publisher=Macmillan |date=2012 |isbn=978-0-76532753-6 |page=240 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-rbwOWK4Dn8C&pg=PA240}}</ref>

===Symbolic computation===
Gosper was the first person to realize the possibilities of [[symbolic computation]] on a computer as a mathematics research tool,{{cn|date=June 2016}} whereas computer methods were previously limited to purely numerical methods. In particular, this research resulted in his work on [[continued fraction]]<ref name=\"contfrac\">{{cite web |url=https://perl.plover.com/yak/cftalk/INFO/gosper.txt |title=Continued Fraction Arithmetic |author-last=Gosper |author-first=Bill |author-link=Bill Gosper |access-date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> representations of real numbers and [[Gosper's algorithm]] for finding closed form [[Hypergeometric series|hypergeometric]] identities.

In 1985 Gosper briefly held the world record for computing the most digits of [[pi#Rapidly convergent series|pi]] with 17 million digits.<ref>{{cite book |author-last1=Arndt |author-first1=Jörg |author-last2=Haenel |author-first2=Christoph |title=Pi Unleashed |publisher=Springer-Verlag |date=2006 |isbn=978-3-540-66572-4<!--isbn only volume 1--> |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QwwcmweJCDQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |pages=104, 206}} English translation by Catriona and David Lischka. Record was in 1985.</ref> See [[chronology of computation of π]].

===Space-filling curves===
In the continuity of early 20th century examples of [[space-filling curve]]s—the Koch-Peano curve, Cesàro and [[Lévy C curve]], all special cases of the general [[de Rham curve]]—and following the path of [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], Gosper discovered the [[Peano-Gosper curve]], before engaging with variations on the [[Dragon curve|Harter-Heighway dragon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WqK4ZWbzI6M |title=Plane-Filling Functions vs. Space-Filling Curves |author-last=Gosper |author-first=Bill |author-link=Bill Gosper |access-date=November 1, 2019}}</ref> In the late 80s, Gosper independently discovered the [[Gosper-Lafitte triangle]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Distribution of nonempty triangles inside a fractal rep-4-tile|encyclopedia=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences |date=1995 |url=https://oeis.org/A000360}}</ref>

==James VI and I==
Maxwell was the son of Robert Maxwell of Kirkhouse (d. 1583) and Nichola[s] Murray, daughter of Charles Murray of Cockpool. His mother was a sister of [[John Murray, 1st Earl of Annandale|John Murray of the bedchamber]] who became [[Earl of Annandale]].<ref>J. C. Sainty, 'A Biographical note on James Maxwell, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod', ''Parliamentary History'', 37:2 (2018), pp. 293-298. at p. 294.</ref>

Maxwell was made an usher daily waiter in the household of [[James VI of Scotland|King James]] in 1603.<ref>J. C. Sainty, 'A Biographical note on James Maxwell, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod', ''Parliamentary History'', 37:2 (2018), p. 294.</ref> A younger brother, Robert Maxwell (d. 1627) was a sergeant-at-arms.

Maxwell was appointed [[Black Rod]] in 1620 on the death of Sir Richard Coningsby in February 1620. The Black Rod officiated at the annual feast of the [[Order of the Garter]] at [[Windsor Castle]] and Maxwell was given a house there, and in 1629 he was made Keeper of the little park at Windsor.<ref>J. C. Sainty, 'A Biographical note on James Maxwell, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod', ''Parliamentary History'', 37:2 (2018), p. 294.</ref>

James Maxwell injured the ear of barrister James (or Edward) Hawley at a masque or reception for the [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon|Duke of Bouillon]] at court in May 1612, when he dragged Hawley from a room by his ear string.<ref>Norman Egbert McClure, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.32106005854481&view=1up&seq=372 ''Letters of John Chamberlain'', vol. 1 (Philadelphia, 1939), pp. 348, 352-3.]</ref>  This became a more serious affair after Hawley threatened to fight a duel, and his lawyer friends at the [[Inns of Court]] took his side, only resolved by the intervention of the king.<ref>John Nichols, ''The progresses, processions, and magnificent festivities of King James the First'', vol. 2 (London, 1828), pp. 443, 449: [https://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/venice/vol12/pp358-366 ''Calendar State Papers Venice: 1610-1613'', vol. 12, (London, 1905), p. 358 no. 516.]</ref> There was adverse feeling in London against the Scots in the court of King James which this incident reflected, and subsequently there was discussion in 1620 if a Scot could be Black Rod, and Maxwell found it difficult to be naturalized as a denizen of England until 1622.<ref>J. C. Sainty, 'A Biographical note on James Maxwell, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod', ''Parliamentary History'', 37:2 (2018), p. 295.</ref>

In July 1622 [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Earl of Kellie|Thomas Erskine, Earl of Kellie]] recommended him to the [[John Erskine, Earl of Mar (1558–1634)|Earl of Mar]] writing that he was probably more useful to Mar than his kinsman [[John Murray, 1st Earl of Annandale]]. Previously Kellie had written how Maxwell had tried to get King Charles to read a letter from Mar, and would encourage Archibald Primrose to further Mar's business with the king.<ref>''HMC Mar & Kellie'', 2 (London, 1930), pp. 112, 120, 127.</ref>

==Charles I==
In 1625 he became a groom of the bedchamber to [[Charles I of England|King Charles]].<ref>J. C. Sainty, 'A Biographical note on James Maxwell, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod', ''Parliamentary History'', 37:2 (2018), p. 295.</ref> As a gentleman in the king's household he was able to access the king and gain patronage for others. He acquired estates in England including, [[Wanborough Manor]], [[Guildford Black Friary|Guildford Priory House]], and [[Kidland|Kidland Manor]], and obtained patents for iron-making and pipe-clay.<ref>J. C. Sainty, 'A Biographical note on James Maxwell, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod', ''Parliamentary History'', 37:2 (2018), p. 295.</ref>

[[File:James I de Critz Mirror of GB (cropped).jpg|thumb|The \"Mirror of Great Britain\" on King James' hat]]
In March 1630 Maxwell, by now wealthy, was involved in the sale of older [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|crown jewels]] with [[Francis Cottington, 1st Baron Cottington|Francis Cottington]] and acquired a number of pieces himself including the two pearls remaining from the [[Mirror of Great Britain]] and [[Anne of Denmark|Anna of Denmark's]] gold circlet set with diamonds, emeralds, rubies and pearls, which had been made for her coronation in England by [[John Spilman|Spilman]] and [[William Herrick (MP)|Herrick]]. There was also a head attire with nine great round pearls.<ref>''Foedera'', vol. 8 part 3 (Hague, 1742), pp. 88-94: ''Calendar State Papers Domestic: Charles I: 1629-1631'' (London, 1860), pp. 216-7, TNA SP16/163 f.31: ''HMC Laing Manuscripts Edinburgh University'', vol. 1 (London, 1914), p. 95: Diana Scarisbrick, 'Anne of Denmark's Jewellery Inventory', ''Archaeologia'' (Torquay, 1991), p. 207 no. 151: Arthur Collins, ''Jewels and Plate of Elizabeth I'' (London 1955), pp. 178-9 fn.</ref>

Maxwell acquired [[Innerwick Castle]], and was known as \"Maxwell of Innerwick\". He bought the lordship of Dirleton and [[Dirleton Castle]] in 1631, and was made [[Earl of Dirletoun]] around 1646, though as in the case his courtier of [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Dysart|William Murray]], [[Earl of Dysart]] and Patrick Maule, [[Earl of Panmure]], the process of granting and confirming these peerages is obscure.<ref>J. C. Sainty, 'A Biographical note on James Maxwell, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod', ''Parliamentary History'', 37:2 (2018), p. 298.</ref>

James Maxwell died at [[Holyrood Palace]] in April 1650, and was buried at [[Dirleton Kirk]].<ref>John Fox, ''The King's Smuggler'' (Stroud, 2010), p. 175.</ref>

==Family==
In 1619 Maxwell married Elizabeth de Boussy, or Bousson de Podolsko (d. 1659), from Antwerp, who had been [[Anne of Denmark]]'s laundry woman and was the widow of William Ryder (d. 1617), a harbinger or clerk of the royal stables.<ref>Nadine Akkerman, ''Invisible Agents'' (Oxford, 2018), p. 34: John Fox, ''The King's Smuggler'' (Stroud, 2010), pp. 323.</ref> She owned a minature portrait of Anna of Denmark's brother, the [[Ulrik of Denmark (1578–1624)|Duke of Holstein]], set with diamonds.<ref>John Fox, ''The King's Smuggler'' (Stroud, 2010), p. 182.</ref> The Royalist agent [[Jane Whorwood]] was her daughter from her marriage to Ryder.

Their daughter Diana Maxwell married [[Charles Cecil, Viscount Cranborne]], and Elizabeth Maxwell married the [[William Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]].

Robert Maxwell, his brother, died in 1627 leaving an embroidered scarf and £50 for a gown to his niece Elizabeth, and a pair of embroidered slippers and £50 to Diana. Another brother, Charles, may have been the Charles Maxwell killed by [[Robert Kerr, 1st Earl of Ancram|Sir Robert Ker]] in a duel at Cambridge in 1620.<ref>Will of Robert Maxwell, sergeant-at-arms, TNA PROB 11-175-74.</ref>

''Yours Truly, the Commuter'' was generally well received by critics. [[AllMusic]] called it \"a gorgeously atmospheric record, a panorama of lush California landscapes filtered through the lonely lens of winter air and rural, mountainous terrain. There's a familiar mix of electronics and acoustic instruments here, but they're linked together more discreetly than before\", calling it \"more cohesive than many of those past [Grandaddy] albums\".<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] wrote: \"''Yours Truly, the Commuter'' sounds an awful lot like a Grandaddy album&nbsp;– not just another Grandaddy album, though, but a really good one, the best since ''[[Sumday]]''.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/>

Less favourable was ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', writing: \"Lytle settles for repetitive mood-setters that merely re-shuffle the elements he's been working with for more than a decade now, with no discernible progress or mastery.\"<ref name=\"A.V. Club\"/>

''Yours Truly, the Commuter'' was generally well received by critics. [[AllMusic]] called it \"a gorgeously atmospheric record, a panorama of lush California landscapes filtered through the lonely lens of winter air and rural, mountainous terrain. There's a familiar mix of electronics and acoustic instruments here, but they're linked together more discreetly than before\", calling it \"more cohesive than many of those past [Grandaddy] albums\".<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] wrote: \"''Yours Truly, the Commuter'' sounds an awful lot like a Grandaddy album&nbsp;– not just another Grandaddy album, though, but a really good one, the best since ''[[Sumday]]''.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/>

Less favourable was ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', writing: \"Lytle settles for repetitive mood-setters that merely re-shuffle the elements he's been working with for more than a decade now, with no discernible progress or mastery.\"<ref name=\"A.V. Club\"/>

'''Mkfancy''' (foaled 28 January 2017) is a French [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse. He was one of the best French juveniles of 2019 when he won two of his three races including the [[Group races|Group 1]] [[Criterium de Saint-Cloud]].

==Background==
Mkfancy is a bay colt with no white [[Horse markings|markings]] bred in France by Marbat LLC, the breeding company of his owner Abdullah Al Maddah. He was sent into training with the Swedish-born Pia Brandt at [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]] in France.

He was from the sixth crop of foals sired by [[Makfi]], who won the [[2000 Guineas]] and the [[Prix Jacques le Marois]] in 2010. Makfi's other foals have included [[Make Believe (horse)|Make Believe]] in Europe and the top-class Australasian winners Marky Mark ([[Manawatu Sires Produce Stakes]]), Sofia Rose ([[Australian Oaks (ATC)|Australian Oaks]]) and Bonneval ([[Underwood Stakes]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/profile/horse/752305/makfi|title=Makfi - Stud Record|work=Racing Post}}</ref>

Mkfancy's dam Fancy Green showed little racing ability, finishing second on her debut but running unplaced in three subsequent starts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/profile/horse/845501/fancy-green/form|title=Fancy Green race record|publisher=Racing Post}}</ref> She was a great-granddaughter of the British broodmare Martingale (foaled 1975, and a half-sister to [[Madelia (horse)|Madelia]]) who produced the [[Group races|Group 1]] winners [[Mersey (horse)|Mersey]] ([[Prix Royal Oak]]) and [[Muncie (horse)|Muncie]] ([[Prix Saint-Alary]]).<ref name=\"tbl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodlines.net/TB/Families/Family1p.htm |title=Hilarity - Family 1-p |website=Thoroughbred Bloodlines |date= |accessdate=2014-06-25}}</ref>

==Racing career==
===2019: two-year-old season===
Mkfancy made his debut in an event for previously unraced juveniles over 1600 metres at [[Longchamp Racecourse]] on 1 September when he was ridden by [[Theo Bachelot]]. Starting at odds of [[Fractional odds|13/1]] in an eleven-runner field he came home third behind [[Victor Ludorum (horse)|Victor Ludorum]] and Twist, beaten five and a quarter [[Horse length|lengths]] from Twist by the winner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/results/211/longchamp/2019-09-01/739278|title=Prix de Fontenoy result |date=1 September 2019|website=Racing Post}}</ref> [[Maxime Guyon]] took the ride when the colt contested a [[maiden race]] on [[Going (horse racing)|very soft ground]] at [[Saint-Cloud Racecourse]] 26 days later and recorded his first success as he won by three lengths from thirteen opponents at odds of 3.1/1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/results/219/saint-cloud/2019-09-27/741284|title=Prix Louqsor result |date=27 September 2019|website=Racing Post}}</ref> 

Bachelot was back in the saddle when Mkfancy was stepped up in class and distance for the [[Group races|Group 1]] Criterium de Saint-Cloud over 2000 metres on heavy ground on 26 October. He started the 5.3/1 third favourite behind The Summit (third in the [[Prix de Conde]]), while the other six runners included Mythical, Arthur's Kingdom and Celtic High King from Ireland and Sound of Cannons and Via de Vega from England. With no previous Group or Listed winners in the field the race appeared to be a sub-standard one by Group 1 standards. Mkfancy led from the start, fought off a challenge from Mythical 300 metres from the finish and kept on well in the closing stages to win by three lengths from Arthur's Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/results/219/saint-cloud/2019-10-26/743601|title=Criterium de Saint-Cloud result |date=26 October 2019|website=Racing Post}}</ref> After the race Pia Brandt said \"He's homebred, and it's a great feeling.

'''Larry's Hideaway''' was a bar in the '''Prince Carlton Hotel''' in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. The venue was notable for being one of the first venues in Toronto to open itself to [[punk rock|punk]] and [[new wave]] music acts, as well as [[hard rock]].<ref name=\"ts\"/> The venue was well known for its good [[acoustics]].<ref name=\"mfe\">{{cite web |url=http://www.myfreakinears.com/10-unforgettable-defunct-toronto-music-venues/ |title=10 Unforgettable Defunct Toronto Music Venues - My Freakin Ears! |accessdate=April 4, 2016}}</ref> Several artists recorded live albums at the venue.

==Venue==
The bar was located in the basement of the Prince Carlton Hotel on the north-west corner of [[Allan Gardens]], on [[Carlton Street]] at [[Jarvis Street]].<ref name=\"eyeopener\"/> The room was a restaurant prior to 1961, when it became a jazz venue.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Globe and Mail |title=JAZZ SCENE: He Had It Once, But It's All Gone Now |first=Patrick |last=Scott |date=August 16, 1961 |page=13}}</ref>

Starting in the late 1970s, the venue was booked by the \"Two Garys\", Gary Topp and Gary Cormier, who also booked bands to \"The Edge\" and to the [[Horseshoe Tavern]]. The bar had a dirty, un-clean reputation<ref name=\"eyeopener\"/><ref name=\"ts\"/> although bands reputedly loved to play there.<ref name=\"eyeopener\"/>

The bar closed in the summer of 1986, but the hotel remained open and was the site of several robberies and sexual assaults.<ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Most robberies on the increase but bank holdups are down 8% |date=29 Oct 1986 |page=A2 |first=Gwyn |last=Jocko}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=2 Men charged in downtown sex attacks |date=October 14, 1986 |page=A7}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Robbed man beaten with clubs and chain |date=November 11, 1986 |page=A6}}</ref> In September 1986, the hotel was raided by the Toronto Police.

It was boarded up and left vacant, sometimes used by squatters and vagrants. On October 16, 1991, a three-alarm fire destroyed much of the hotel.<ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |date=October 16, 1991 |title=Arson Suspected in $1 million fire |first=Henry |last=Stancu |page=A7}}</ref> The [[City of Toronto government]] bought it in 1993 to increase the size of Allan Gardens park. It is now the location of the off-leash dog area in the park.

'''Larry's Hideaway''' was a bar in the '''Prince Carlton Hotel''' in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. The venue was notable for being one of the first venues in Toronto to open itself to [[punk rock|punk]] and [[new wave]] music acts, as well as [[hard rock]].<ref name=\"ts\"/> The venue was well known for its good [[acoustics]].<ref name=\"mfe\">{{cite web |url=http://www.myfreakinears.com/10-unforgettable-defunct-toronto-music-venues/ |title=10 Unforgettable Defunct Toronto Music Venues - My Freakin Ears! |accessdate=April 4, 2016}}</ref> Several artists recorded live albums at the venue.

==Venue==
The bar was located in the basement of the Prince Carlton Hotel on the north-west corner of [[Allan Gardens]], on [[Carlton Street]] at [[Jarvis Street]].<ref name=\"eyeopener\"/> The room was a restaurant prior to 1961, when it became a jazz venue.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Globe and Mail |title=JAZZ SCENE: He Had It Once, But It's All Gone Now |first=Patrick |last=Scott |date=August 16, 1961 |page=13}}</ref>

Starting in the late 1970s, the venue was booked by the \"Two Garys\", Gary Topp and Gary Cormier, who also booked bands to \"The Edge\" and to the [[Horseshoe Tavern]]. The bar had a dirty, un-clean reputation<ref name=\"eyeopener\"/><ref name=\"ts\"/> although bands reputedly loved to play there.<ref name=\"eyeopener\"/>

The bar closed in the summer of 1986, but the hotel remained open and was the site of several robberies and sexual assaults.<ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Most robberies on the increase but bank holdups are down 8% |date=29 Oct 1986 |page=A2 |first=Gwyn |last=Jocko}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=2 Men charged in downtown sex attacks |date=October 14, 1986 |page=A7}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Robbed man beaten with clubs and chain |date=November 11, 1986 |page=A6}}</ref> In September 1986, the hotel was raided by the Toronto Police.

It was boarded up and left vacant, sometimes used by squatters and vagrants. On October 16, 1991, a three-alarm fire destroyed much of the hotel.<ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |date=October 16, 1991 |title=Arson Suspected in $1 million fire |first=Henry |last=Stancu |page=A7}}</ref> The [[City of Toronto government]] bought it in 1993 to increase the size of Allan Gardens park. It is now the location of the off-leash dog area in the park.

'''Beeston Hall School''' is an independent day and boarding [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] for boys and girls in the village of [[Beeston Regis]], [[Norfolk]].<ref>{{citenews|title=Schools Guide 2016: Beeston Hall|url=http://www.tatler.com/guides/schools-guide/2016/prep/beeston-hall|work=[[Tatler]]}}</ref> 
Founded in 1948, Beeston Hall currently accommodates 125 pupils aged 4 – 13 making it the largest boarding [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] in East Anglia.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/about-us/origins/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525045348/http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/about-us/origins/ |archive-date=25 May 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== History ==
Originally called Beeston Regis Hall, it was once the family home of the Wyndham Ketton-Cremers on the Beeston Regis Estate, part of the much larger [[Felbrigg Hall|Felbrigg Estate]], the family seat. In 1940 a German bomb hit the school, causing slight damage. The Hall was leased to Thomas Tapping and his wife Bessie, who opened the private Beeston Hall School in 1948. In 1967 the school became an incorporated trust, and in 1970, following the death of [[Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer]], the last squire of Felbrigg, the school acquired the freehold and about 14 acres (5.7 ha) of land. Over the years the school has expanded; it is the biggest employer in the parish. It has also acquired other surrounding land including Beeston Hall Common, which it purchased from the parish of Beeston Regis.

== Present school ==
The school is currently split into two parts;
* Pre-Prep (ages 4 – 6)
* Prep (ages 7 – 13)

Its pupils take the [[Common Entrance Examination]], going on to a range of [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] such as [[Oundle School|Oundle]], [[Uppingham School|Uppingham]], [[Oakham School|Oakham]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Radley College|Radley]], [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Tudor Hall School, Banbury|Tudor Hall]], [[Norwich High School for Girls|Norwich High School]], [[Gresham's School|Gresham’s]], [[The leys]] and [[Stowe School|Stowe]].<ref>http://www.tatler.com/guides/schools-guide/2016/prep/beeston-hall</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/curriculum/senior-schools/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425064243/http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/curriculum/senior-schools/ |archive-date=2016-04-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2009 55 percent of Common Entrance papers were graded A or B, rising to 76 percent by 2013; in 2014 figures stood at 92 percent.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/curriculum/achievements-results/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425062759/http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/curriculum/achievements-results/ |archive-date=25 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

'''The Spooklight''', also called the '''Hornet Spooklight''', '''Hollis Light''' and '''Joplin Spook Light''', is a light that appears in a small area known locally as the \"Devil's Promenade\" on the border between southwestern [[Missouri]] and northeastern [[Oklahoma]] west of the small town of [[Hornet, Missouri]].

Even though it is named after a small, unincorporated community in Missouri from which it is most commonly reached, the light is most commonly described as being visible from inside the Oklahoma border looking to the west. The Spooklight is commonly described as a single ball of light or a tight grouping of lights that is said to appear in the area regularly, usually at night. Although the description of the light is similar to that of other visual phenomena witnessed throughout the world, the term \"Spooklight\" when standing alone generally refers to this specific case. Numerous legends exist that attempt to describe the origin of the Spooklight, one of which involves the ghosts of two young [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lovers looking for each other.

== History ==
According to most accounts, it has appeared continually since the late 19th century,<ref name=unknown>[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=071030_1_A4_spanc63203 Spooklights' source is still unknown ], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', October 30, 2007</ref> although it was generally not well known to anyone but locals until after [[World War II]]. Some date the first encounters with the light back to the [[Trail of Tears]] in the 1830s. However, the first documented sighting is generally accepted to have occurred in 1881, although some report sightings as far back as 1866. The earliest published report was in 1936 in the ''[[Kansas City Star]]''.

In 1946 the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] supposedly studied the \"Hornet Light\", but could not find a cause for it. In their words, it was a \"mysterious light of unknown origin\".<ref name=unknown />  Early residents of the area reported seeing lights in the woods, over their land, or even in their yards.

During the 1960s, there was a [[general store]] in Hornet that gave out information about the light to sightseers. It included a \"Spooklight Museum\". There have also been various establishments along the Missouri-Oklahoma state line that served a similar function, but they have since closed. During the 1960s and 1970s the roads where the Spooklight usually appears were often packed with parked vehicles and people hoping to get a glimpse of the mysterious light.

== Appearance ==
Aficionados say the best chances for spotting the light occur after dark when parked on Oklahoma East 50 Road, four miles south of the three-state junction of [[Kansas]], Missouri and Oklahoma in [[Ottawa County, Oklahoma]] and looking to the west. One must sit very silently. The light has been seen in backyards of the area and has been spotted both near to and far away from sightseers. Its color is also not consistent: some eyewitnesses report a greenish glow while others describe it as orange, red, yellow, or even blue. It is almost always said to be in the shape of a ball, although some say it more resembles a camping [[lantern]] traveling a couple of feet off the ground.

== Explanations ==
Explanations for the light's appearance vary widely from the extraordinary to the mundane. The area of Oklahoma in which the light is seen is very hilly and forested and out to the west of where the light is seen lies [[Interstate 44]]. It has been suggested that the headlights of cars seen over the hills explain the light's appearance, which is sometimes said to bob up and down, dance, or even split into multiple globules of light. In [[William Least Heat-Moon]]'s 2008 book ''Roads to Quoz'', the author suggests that the lights seen at the end of E 50 are explained perfectly by the fact that the road aligns directly with [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] across the interstate and the river valley, some ten miles distant. He also claims that earlier sightings of the light from E 40 Road, one mile to the north, are explained by an earlier alignment of Route 66 to the north of the town of [[Quapaw, Oklahoma]], also aligned with E 40 Road. The author suggests that there are no reliable sightings of the light in any location but directly west along the road and therefore explainable by the Route 66 connection. Robert Gannon, writing for Popular Mechanics Magazine, also claims that the Spooklights are headlights from Route 66, citing a test in which he flashed his headlights on Route 66 at a certain time and the Spooklights were reported to flash as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOMDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&lr&rview=1&pg=PA116#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Popular Mechanics|work=google.com|accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref>

Other explanations for the light's appearance include atmospheric gases being affected by electrical fields. A [[University of Arkansas]] professor studied the light in the 1960s and suggested that it was from a fixed object.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

In 2014, professor Allen Rice, Ph.D. of the University of Central Oklahoma investigated the Spooklight with a team of investigators called the Boomers and discovered the source of the light as car headlights and taillights 9 miles west of the viewing spot. He conducted an experiment with the Boomers and was able to recreate a light with the headlights of a car from the junction of E 50 and [[Oklahoma State Highway 137|State Highway 137]], located south of [[Quapaw, Oklahoma|Quapaw]].

The \"Leaning Tower of Dallas\" is the core of an 11-story building in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] that unexpectedly remained standing and slightly leaning after the demolition of the building it was part of. On February 16, 2020, Lloyd D. Nabors Demolition company demolished it to make way for a $2.5 billion mixed-use project. The building quickly became an Internet meme and a social media hotspot for selfies. People went to Dallas from all over Texas to take photos with it, much like people do when visiting the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2020/02/20/leaning-tower-dallas-citys-accidental-tourist-destination/4825127002/ | title=Leaning Tower of Dallas survived demolition to become city's accidental Instagram star  | publisher=USA Today | accessdate= April 7, 2020}}</ref>.

== Background ==

The building was built in 1971 and was the Southland Corporation Office Tower. It later became the Affiliated Computer Services building until Xerox acquired them and then Xerox took ownership of it. The building was later acquired by De La Vega Development. It was a concrete office building located at 2828 North Haskell Avenue. It had 11 stories and was 47.9 m / 157 ft tall<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building/id/37017 | title=Affiliated Computer Services Building  | publisher=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat | accessdate= April 7, 2020}}</ref>. The reason why the core did not collapse with the rest of building was explained by Thomas Taylor, the principal design engineer. He said, \"[It had] a cast-in-place concrete core, we call it a slip-form concrete core. And that became the stabilizing element for the building. So it's sort of like the tree trunk of a tree. I mean, what came off is all the branches and the leaves. But the tree trunk is a little harder to bring down than the branches<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/engineer-who-helped-design-dallas-leaning-tower-explains-why-its-so-hard-to-tear-down/287-81ef45c3-c6de-43a4-bd25-96c57aaadd48 | title=Engineer who helped design 'Leaning Tower of Dallas' building explains why it's so hard to tear down  | publisher=WFAA-TV | accessdate= April 7, 2020}}</ref>.\"

== Demolition ==

On February 16, 2020 Lloyd D. Nabors Demolition used 300 pounds of dynamite to demolish the building to make room for a $2.5 billion mixed-use project by De La Vega Development for that property<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/the-leaning-tower-of-dallas-has-finally-been-demolished/ar-BB10EG2s | title=The 'leaning tower of Dallas' has finally been demolished  | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate= April 7, 2020}}</ref>. The entire building collapsed except the core which housed the elevator shaft and stairwell. The core collapsed slightly at its base then just stopped falling. The core ended up stabilizing with a slight lean. According to Artemio De La Vega, CEO of De La Vega Development, \"The core settled into the basement probably, approximately...I'd say 35 to 40 feet down into the basement, which is basically what is holding the tower.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/leaning-tower-of-dallas-draws-crowd-for-lawn-party/2321936/ | title=‘Leaning Tower of Dallas’ Draws Crowd for Lawn Party  | publisher=NBC Universal Inc. | accessdate= April 7, 2020}}</ref>

After the demolition, Dallas-based Lloyd D. Nabors Demolition, said they had a multistep plan to bring down the rest of the building. They planned on using a combination of a wrecking ball to destroy the upper portion of the core and a high-reach excavator to knock down the rest of it.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.enr.com/articles/48762-leaning-tower-of-dallas-still-standing-after-failed-demolition | title=Leaning Tower of Dallas' Still Standing After Failed Demolition  | publisher=BNP Media | accessdate= April 7, 2020}}</ref>. On February 24 they began the new phase of demolition. When the wrecking ball hit the building it appeared to do no damage at all. The wrecking ball was about 3.5 feet tall and weighed 5,600 pounds, giving it a tiny appearance in photos and videos as it swung into the building.

==Family==
His father was Augustin-Antoine de Ferriol (1653-1736 or 1737), comte d'Argental, [[président à mortier]] of the [[parlement]] of [[Metz]] and brother of Charles de Ferriol d'Argental, French ambassador to the [[Sublime Porte]].  His mother was Marie-Angélique de Tencin, sister of cardinal [[Pierre Guérin de Tencin]] and [[Claudine Guérin de Tencin]], mother of [[d'Alembert]]. His brother was the dramatic writer [[:fr:Antoine de Ferriol de Pont-de-Veyle]].  In 1737 he married Jeanne-Grâce Bosc du Bouchet (d.1774).<ref>{{cite web |title=Charles-Augustin de Ferriol, Count of Argental |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Charles-Augustin-de-Ferriol-Count-of-Argental/6000000046191088200 |website=geni.com |publisher=Geni.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}</ref> He was nicknamed 'goussaut' ('sturdy horse') within his family.<ref>Pittet Joël, ''Lettres privées de Mme de Tencin et du futur cardinal de Tencin à leur frère le président de Tencin et autres'', Imp.

==Career==
D'Argental passed his bar exams in 1719 and became an advocate in the Parlement of Paris in 1721.  He was offered the post of intendant of [[Saint-Domingue]] in 1738, but turned it down; he did however accept the post of Minister Plenipotentiary to France of the [[Duchy of Parma]] and [[Piacenza]] from 1759 to 1788. During the disputes between [[Louis XV]] and the Parlement in the 1750s, he was more inclined to the side of the Crown than of those seeking greater independence for the Parlement.<ref>{{cite book|title=Autobiography: A Collection of the Most Instructive and Amusing Lives Ever Published|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn09AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA131|year=1829|publisher=Whittaker, Treacher, and Arnot|page=131}}</ref><ref name=\"VS\"/>

==Friendship with Voltaire==
Like Voltaire, d'Argental was educated at Louis-le-Grand, though as he was six years younger, it is not certain that they knew each other at school.  Like Voltaire he was devoted to the theatre.<ref name=\"Davidson\">{{cite book|author=Ian Davidson|title=Voltaire: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFU0CgAAQBAJ&pg=PT325|date=2012-03-12|publisher=Pegasus Books|isbn=978-1-68177-039-0}}</ref>{{rp|325}}  Voltaire's first letter to him was written in 1724 and after this they corresponded frequently - more than 1,200 from Voltaire to d'Argental have survived, though d'Argental wrote much less often, and never visited Voltaire in [[Ferney-Voltaire|Ferney]].<ref name=\"Davidson\"/>

From 1737, supported by his wife, he became Voltaire’s literary critical friend, as well as his theatre agent and even his stage director. While Voltaire was exiled in Ferney it was the d’Argentals who did what was necessary to bring his plays to the stage, securing the venues, contracting the actors, and working with them intensively to ensure that Voltaire’s meaning was properly communicated.<ref name=\"VS\">{{cite web |title=Charles Augustin de Ferriol, comte d'Argental |url=http://www.correspondance-voltaire.de/html/argental.php |website=Correspondence-Voltaire.de |publisher=Voltaire-Stiftung |accessdate=29 October 2018}}</ref>

As well as helping Voltaire in theatrical matters, d’Argental was his indispensable organiser in the campaigns against injustice in the 1760s - the [[Jean Calas|Calas]], [[François-Jean de la Barre|de la Barre]] and [[Pierre-Paul Sirven|Sirven Affairs]]. His close connections with the court and in particular with the Foreign Minister [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul|Choiseul]] were especially useful in these cases.<ref name=\"VS\"/>

In 1760, when funds were being raised to pay for a statue of Voltaire by [[Jean-Baptiste Pigalle|Pigalle]], he did not have enough money to make a contribution, so he borrowed 10,000 livres from Voltaire himself. From the time Voltaire returned from exile to Paris in February 1788 until his death in May, d’Argental was with him constantly.<ref name=\"VS\"/>

==Relationship with Adrienne Lecouvreur==
As a young man he developed an infatuation for the famous actress [[Adrienne Lecouvreur]].  His mother was afraid that he would marry her, and threatened to send him to the colonies to prevent this.  The actress wrote to her in 1721 promising to spurn his advances, and urging her not to exile a son so able and so full of promise. D'Argental knew nothing of this correspondence until, sixty-three years later, he was going through his mother's papers at the age of eighty-five.<ref>{{cite book|author=Will Durant|title=The Complete Story of Civilization: Our Oriental Heritage, Life of Greece, Caesar and Christ, Age of Faith, Renaissance, Age of Reason Begins, Age of Louis XIV, Age of Voltaire, Rousseau and Revolution, Age of Napoleon, Reformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CfGPAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT8662|date=2014-01-21|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4767-7971-3}}</ref>  As was normal at the time for actors, Lecouvreur was denied a proper Christian burial when she died and her body was disposed of in unconsecrated ground.  In 1786, fifty-six years after her death, d'Argental managed to located her burial place at what is new 115 rue de la Grenelle in Paris.  He placed there a marble tablet with a poem to her that he had written.<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles Collins|title=Great Love Stories of the Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-hl5sUZ9FYC&pg=PA137|date=2009-12-01|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=978-1-4344-0830-3|page=137}}</ref>

==Work==
It is believed by some scholars that d'Argenson was the true author of the ''[[:fr:Mémoires du comte de Comminge]]'' (1735) which was published by his aunt, Mme de Tencin. However Voltaire confirmed that d'Argenson himself never claimed to have been the author.<ref name=\"VS\"/>

==Death==
D'Argental died in 1788 after contracting a fever, which lasted only a few days.<ref name=\"VS\"/>

D'Argental knew nothing of this correspondence until, sixty-three years later, he was going through his mother's papers at the age of eighty-five.<ref>{{cite book|author=Will Durant|title=The Complete Story of Civilization: Our Oriental Heritage, Life of Greece, Caesar and Christ, Age of Faith, Renaissance, Age of Reason Begins, Age of Louis XIV, Age of Voltaire, Rousseau and Revolution, Age of Napoleon, Reformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CfGPAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT8662|date=2014-01-21|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4767-7971-3}}</ref>  As was normal at the time for actors, Lecouvreur was denied a proper Christian burial when she died and her body was disposed of in unconsecrated ground.  In 1786, fifty-six years after her death, d'Argental managed to located her burial place at what is new 115 rue de la Grenelle in Paris.  He placed there a marble tablet with a poem to her that he had written.<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles Collins|title=Great Love Stories of the Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-hl5sUZ9FYC&pg=PA137|date=2009-12-01|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=978-1-4344-0830-3|page=137}}</ref>

==Work==
It is believed by some scholars that d'Argenson was the true author of the ''[[:fr:Mémoires du comte de Comminge]]'' (1735) which was published by his aunt, Mme de Tencin. However Voltaire confirmed that d'Argenson himself never claimed to have been the author.<ref name=\"VS\"/>

==Death==
D'Argental died in 1788 after contracting a fever, which lasted only a few days.<ref name=\"VS\"/>

wikilink brevity,safe,CJK09,"The '''site of the [[Roman conquest of Britain#Landing to Thames battle|Claudian invasion of Britain]]''' in AD 43 is a matter of academic debate. Although it is generally believed that the force left from Gesoriacum ([[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]), it is possible that part of the fleet sailed from near the mouth of the Rhine. And while [[Rutupiæ]] ([[Richborough]], on the east coast of [[Kent]]) is often stated as the site of the landing (e.g. by [[Sheppard Frere]]),<ref>[[Sheppard Frere]] (1967), ''Britannia: A History of Roman Britain'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, London</ref> there are equally plausible arguments in favour of a landing further west along the south coast of Britain.

The only contemporary detailed account of the invasion comes from [[Cassius Dio]]'s ''Roman History'',<ref>[[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#19 60:19-22]</ref> written in the early 3rd century. He states that the main invasion force under [[Aulus Plautius]] sailed in three divisions, and George Patrick Welch<ref>George Patrick Welch (1963), ''Britannia: the Roman Conquest and Occupation of Britain''</ref> argues that there were three landing sites in Kent: [[Lympne]] furthest west (the [[Legio II Augusta]] under [[Vespasian]]), [[Dover]] in the centre (the [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix]] under an unknown commander) and Richborough in the east (the [[Legio IX Hispana|IX Hispana]] and [[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV Gemina]] under the overall command of Plautius). The three divisions would have then advanced from the coast and met at the [[River Medway]].

Other historians dispute that the Romans landed in Kent. Dio describes how the troops saw a [[meteoroid|shooting star]] whilst at sea and were cheered by this [[omen]]. He adds that it travelled from east to west and that this was the direction the Romans were sailing in. However, a voyage from Boulogne to Kent sails from south to north.

Taking Boulogne as the point of departure, historians such as [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]]<ref>[[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]] (1982), ''Londinium: London in the Roman Empire''</ref> and J. G. F. Hind<ref>J G F Hind (1989), The Invasion of Britain in AD 43, ''Britannia'', 20, 1-21</ref> have used Dio's account to suggest a landing point much further west along the south coast of Britain, around [[the Solent]] or [[Southampton Water]]. This is supported by Dio's stated reason for the Roman invasion, that [[Verica]], the king of the [[Atrebates]] who lived in the area of modern-day [[Hampshire]], had appealed for Roman assistance after he was expelled in a coup, and by [[Suetonius]]'s assertion that Vespasian conquered the [[Isle of Wight]].<ref>[[Suetonius]], ''Vespasian'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#4 4]</ref>

Similarly Dio writes of an early victory when the Romans received the surrender of a tribe he calls the \"Bodunni\". No tribe of this name is known, but it is very similar to that of the [[Dobunni]] who occupied [[Gloucestershire]]. In this case, a landing point in the region of [[Chichester]] or [[Portsmouth]] might be expected.

The remains of military storehouses dating to the appropriate period have been found under [[Fishbourne Roman Palace]], a 1st-century [[Roman villa]] near Chichester and, on the basis of this, and other archaeological evidence, archaeologist [[Barry Cunliffe]], formerly a proponent of the Kent hypothesis, has stated that he was becoming persuaded by the arguments in favour of a South Coast landing.<ref>[[Barry Cunliffe]] (1998), ''Fishbourne Roman Palace'', Tempus, Stroud, p 21</ref>

Other historians argue that, as the Roman invasion fleet may have numbered as many as 1,000 ships, mostly slow and ungainly troop transports, its commanders would have wanted to minimise the time spent at sea because of the risk of contrary winds, and that this favours the short route to Kent rather than the longer journey up the Channel to the Solent. Richborough had a large natural harbour (long since silted up) which would have provided a suitable anchorage for the landing (though its capacity to hold more than a small part of the fleet has been questioned),<ref>E W Black (2000), \"Sentius Saturninus and the Roman Invasion of Britain\", ''Britannia'', 31, 1-10</ref> and there are archaeological remains of earthworks, interpreted as defensive ditches, dug to protect the anchorage, dating to the period of the invasion. There is also evidence at Richborough of a ceremonial arch, which may have commemorated Richborough's role in the invasion, but as the arch was not constructed until c AD 80, by which time Rutupiæ was the major port of entry into Britain from the continent, its relation to the events of the invasion is uncertain.

The British defence was led by [[Caratacus]] and [[Togodumnus]] of the [[Catuvellauni]], an eastern kingdom with influence over Kent, and the Romans' immediate objective seems to have been to secure a crossing of the River [[Thames]] in order to reach the territory of the Catuvellauni. The Dobunni, who Dio says were tributaries of the Catuvellauni, could have sent troops eastwards to their aid, who then surrendered to Plautius in Kent. In this scenario, Vespasian's western conquests could have taken place after the Thames crossing was secured.

According to Suetonius, Claudius sailed from Boulogne,<ref>Suetonius, ''Claudius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#17 17]</ref> and it is usually assumed that the  main force under Plautius sailed from the same place, but it is possible that Plautius's forces sailed from the mouth of the [[Rhine]], which [[Strabo]] names as a point of departure used for crossings to Britain in the early 1st century; ships commonly sailed along the coast of [[Gallia Belgica|Belgic Gaul]] to the territory of the [[Morini]], before taking a relatively short open-sea crossing to Britain.<ref>[[Strabo]], ''Geography'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4E*.html#5.2 4:5.2]</ref> This would account for the westward journey in Dio's account. On the other hand, if the Rhine was the point of departure, and if the Catuvellauni were Plautius's objective, it could be argued that a landing south of the Thames would have been unnecessary and have entailed as much risk as a landing north of the river.

The three divisions mentioned by Dio also leave open the possibility that, while the main landing was in Kent, part of the force sailed to the Solent to aid Verica, or vice versa. Dio, of course, wrote about 150 years after the event, and his sources are unknown; the details of his account are uncorroborated and may be unreliable.
