The rest of ''The Hurdy Gurdy Man'' was recorded in April 1968, after he visited [[Rishikesh]] in India to study [[Transcendental Meditation]] under [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]. [[John Lennon]], [[Cynthia Lennon]], [[George Harrison]], [[Pattie Boyd]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Jane Asher]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Mia Farrow]], [[Prudence Farrow]] and [[Mike Love]] were there as well. Harrison wrote a verse for \"[[Hurdy Gurdy Man]]\" when they were in India, but it was cut from the studio version in order to ensure that the song was not overly long for a single.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leitch|first=Donovan|title=The Autobiography of Donovan: The Hurdy Gurdy Man|year=2005|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-312-35252-3|pp=210, 219|ref=harv}}</ref> On his 1973 live album ''[[Live in Japan: Spring Tour 1973]]'' and his 1990 live album ''[[Rising (Donovan album)|Rising]]'', Donovan explains the story and sings the previously omitted verse.
