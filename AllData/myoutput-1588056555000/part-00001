Although a [[live-action]] series, the series also includes [[animated cartoon]] sequences of Kirby's drawings. The series stars [[Jacob Bertrand]], Olivia Stuck, Mekai Curtis, Cade Sutton, and [[Tiffany Espensen]].\n\n== Plot ==\nKirby Buckets dreams of becoming a famous animator like his idol, Mac McCallister, and interacts with his cartoon creations. Similar to Nicholas Martin in ''[[McGee and Me!]]'', Kirby sees his drawings take shape as he and his two best friends, Fish and Eli, go on outrageous and unpredictable adventures.\n\nIn the third season, Kirby is sued by Dawn and forbidden from drawing ever again. During a trip to the principal's office he finds a small orb device which allows him to travel to alternate realities. Using it, Kirby accidentally sends his parents to an alternate dimension, and picks up their counterparts from a ''[[Mad Max (franchise)|Mad Max]]''-like universe. Now Kirby must find his parents, while having a little fun along the way.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Kirby Buckets episodes}}\n{{:List of Kirby Buckets episodes}}\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Jacob Bertrand]] as Kirby Buckets, a boy who dreams of becoming a famous animator\n* Olivia Stuck as Dawn Buckets, Kirby's older sister.\n* Mekai Curtis as Fish, Kirby's best friend alongside Eli.\n* Cade Sutton as Eli, Kirby's best friend alongside Fish.\n* [[Tiffany Espensen]] as Belinda, Dawn's best friend.\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"The main cast, dressed in character, on the ''Kirby Buckets'' set, in 2014\">\nFile:Jacob Bertrand on Red Carpet Report.jpg | Jacob Bertrand, \"Kirby\"\nFile:Tiffany Espensen and Olivia Stuck on Red Carpet Report.jpg | Tiffany Espensen, \"Belinda\", and Olivia Stuck, \"Dawn\"\nFile:Cade Sutton and Mekai Curtis on Red Carpet Report.jpg | Cade Sutton, \"Eli\", and Mekai Curtis, \"Fish\"\n</gallery>\n\n=== Recurring ===\n* Suzi Barrett as Mom, Kirby's mother\n* Michael Naughton as Dad, Kirby's father.\n* Stephen Kearin as Principal Mitchell, the principal at Kirby's school.\n* Jack Foley as Big Ricky, a student at Kirby's school.\n\n== Production ==\nDisney XD first developed and piloted ''Kirby Buckets'' in 2012 with producers Gabe Snyder and Mike Alber, [[David Bowers (director)|David Bowers]], and Kristofor Brown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2012/tv/news/disney-xd-orders-kirby-pilot-1118060182/|title=Disney XD Orders Kirby Buckets Pilot|work=Variety|author=Jon Weisman|date=October 2, 2012|access-date=September 13, 2014}}</ref> ''Kirby Buckets'' was picked up as a series in February 2014.
