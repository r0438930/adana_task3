Record producer [[Richard Perry]] had introduced the song to the Pointers by playing them a tape of Bruce Springsteen singing it,<ref>''Sioux Falls Argus-Leader'' 26 April 1979 \"Pointers Pleased With New Direction\" by Marshall Fine p.2C</ref> causing Anita Pointer to say: \"It's too low for me: I guess you want Ruthie to sing it\" to which Perry replied: \"No \u2013 I want you to sing it.\"<ref name=\"Bullseye with Jesse Thorn\" /> [[Knight Ridder]] music critic Christine Arnold cited \"Fire\" as \"''Energy'' 's [main] highlight<span style=font-size:65%\">......</span>Springsteen has created a song that might well have been done by [[the Ronettes]] in the '60s, and the Pointers inherit and develop the legacy nicely. Lyrically it's a simple song, but one that captures the indecision of a woman who wants and does not want a man all at the same time. And when the Pointers sing [the lyric] ''fire'' it's enough to sear your turntable.\"<ref>The Evening Independent (St. Petersburg) 20 January 1979, p.11-D</ref>\n\nRising to no. 2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine in February 1979 (behind [[Rod Stewart]]'s \"[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]\"), \"Fire\" was eventually tied by \"[[Slow Hand]]\" (1981) as the Pointer Sister's highest-charting single. A hit on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] and [[Adult Contemporary]] charts at respectively no. 14 and no.. 22, \"Fire\" also afforded the Pointer Sisters an international chart hit, reaching no. 1 in Belgium, the Netherlands, South Africa and New Zealand, and charting in Australia (no. 7), Austria (no. 10), Canada (no. 3), Germany (no. 35) and the UK (no. 34).\n\nAnita Pointer recalled, \"['Fire'] became [the Pointer Sisters'] first [[RIAA certification|gold single]]: we had had [[RIAA certification|gold albums]] before but I didn't realize what a difference a gold single made 'cause<span style=\"font-size: 60%\">...</span>that one song [is played] over and over all over the world.
