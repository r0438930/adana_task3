Popularly known as the \"Jelly Bean Lady\", she has promoted an [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] approach to medicine since being diagnosed with cancer herself. In the media, she has presented expos\u00e9s of unproven treatments, some of which have resulted in successful legal prosecutions. She was awarded the Medal of the [[Order of Australia]] for her service to health, and she has been \"[[Australian Skeptics#Awards and prizes|Skeptic of the Year]]\" three times.\n\n==Background==\n\nMarron was born in [[Hanover]], West Germany in 1951. Her family moved to the United Kingdom in 1954, and then to [[South Australia]] in 1959. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science from the [[University of Adelaide]] in 1972, with majors in Physics and Mathematics. She spent her career working as an [[information technology]] specialist.<ref name=AustDoctor20110916>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Paul|title=In the Hot Seat|journal=Australian Doctor|date=16 September 2011|page=19|issn=1039-7116}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. At her cancer support group, she was exposed to promotions for a range of alternative treatments, many of which urged her to reject conventional medicine and not to have surgery or chemotherapy.  However, her research revealed that there was a lack of evidence to support the effectiveness of those alternative treatments. Marron said she became horrified to see how charlatans were attempting to take advantage of her and fellow sufferers, offering treatments with no verifiable benefits, often while charging large fees, and this drove her to expose the worst practices of people who promote unproven, \"alternative\" approaches.<ref name=Corderoy_20130309>{{cite news|last1=Corderoy|first1=Amy|title=Having a bone to pick with natural medicine|work=[[The Age]] (Melbourne)|date=9 March 2013|page=19|publisher=John Fairfax Publications|ISSN=0312-6307}}</ref>\n\n\"It's understandable that people reach out for alternatives when they are ill.

Instead, she has worked with medical specialists, researchers, and practitioners to ensure her information is backed by evidence.

They were not able to tell which one had the magnets and which one had the jelly beans through the mattress - the results were the same. This trial was telecast on Channel Nine, and their journalist suggested the name \"Jelly Bean Lady\" which Marron stayed with. Her conclusion that the magnets were just as effective as jelly beans, was an effective way to communicate the results accurately to a non-technical audience, without using jargon about topics such as controls and blinding.<ref name=Hinde_20110925>{{cite news|last1=Hinde|first1=Suellen|title=Loretta on crusade for vulnerable|work= The (Brisbane) Sunday Mail|date=25 September 2011|pages=13}}</ref>\n\nShe further developed this persona of \"the Jellybean Lady\", including colourful clothing to play well on television, as a fun way to engage people's attention while being easily identifiable.

Marron's under-cover investigation was covered on national television, including showing the practitioner mixing up and injecting the mixture into Maria Worth, who was dying of breast cancer and paid $2000 for the \"treatment\". Four days later, Worth was in the emergency ward at Toowoomba Hospital with life-threatening blood clots.

Popularly known as the \"Jelly Bean Lady\", she has promoted an [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] approach to medicine since being diagnosed with cancer herself. In the media, she has presented expos\u00e9s of unproven treatments, some of which have resulted in successful legal prosecutions. She was awarded the Medal of the [[Order of Australia]] for her service to health, and she has been \"[[Australian Skeptics#Awards and prizes|Skeptic of the Year]]\" three times.\n\n==Background==\n\nMarron was born in [[Hanover]], West Germany in 1951. Her family moved to the United Kingdom in 1954, and then to [[South Australia]] in 1959. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science from the [[University of Adelaide]] in 1972, with majors in Physics and Mathematics. She spent her career working as an [[information technology]] specialist.<ref name=AustDoctor20110916>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Paul|title=In the Hot Seat|journal=Australian Doctor|date=16 September 2011|page=19|issn=1039-7116}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. At her cancer support group, she was exposed to promotions for a range of alternative treatments, many of which urged her to reject conventional medicine and not to have surgery or chemotherapy.  However, her research revealed that there was a lack of evidence to support the effectiveness of those alternative treatments. Marron said she became horrified to see how charlatans were attempting to take advantage of her and fellow sufferers, offering treatments with no verifiable benefits, often while charging large fees, and this drove her to expose the worst practices of people who promote unproven, \"alternative\" approaches.<ref name=Corderoy_20130309>{{cite news|last1=Corderoy|first1=Amy|title=Having a bone to pick with natural medicine|work=[[The Age]] (Melbourne)|date=9 March 2013|page=19|publisher=John Fairfax Publications|ISSN=0312-6307}}</ref>\n\n\"It's understandable that people reach out for alternatives when they are ill.

Instead, she has worked with medical specialists, researchers, and practitioners to ensure her information is backed by evidence. Initially she worked with her GP and <!--Geraldine Moses from -->the Adverse Medicines Advice service to create a brochure on how to get good advice, and then a website called ''Health Information'', aimed at helping other patients to get trustworthy\nmedical information that is based on reliable evidence.<ref name=AustDoctor20110916/><ref name=SkepticZone276/>{{rp|at=7:00}}\n\nMarron approached the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA) for assistance, but their policy was that if a product could claim \"traditional use\" then they would list it without needing any assessment of whether that product was safe or effective.

She started to refer to this role as a \"Jelly bean therapist\", complete with a range of mock jelly bean \"therapies\".<ref name=SkepticZone276/>\n\nMarron became known as \"the Jelly Bean Lady\" after she used jelly beans to test magnetised mattress underlays, which the makers claimed could cure a range of health ailments.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mccarty-O'Kane|first1=Roxanne|title=Ms Jellybean's sweet success|url=http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/ms-jellybeans-sweet-success-darryl-jones/767876/|accessdate=28 September 2015|work=Sunshine Coast Daily|date=12 February 2011}}</ref>  She substituted jelly beans for the magnets in one of the underlays, and had participants test them using a meter that measures magnetism.  They were not able to tell which one had the magnets and which one had the jelly beans through the mattress - the results were the same. This trial was telecast on Channel Nine, and their journalist suggested the name \"Jelly Bean Lady\" which Marron stayed with. Her conclusion that the magnets were just as effective as jelly beans, was an effective way to communicate the results accurately to a non-technical audience, without using jargon about topics such as controls and blinding.<ref name=Hinde_20110925>{{cite news|last1=Hinde|first1=Suellen|title=Loretta on crusade for vulnerable|work= The (Brisbane) Sunday Mail|date=25 September 2011|pages=13}}</ref>\n\nShe further developed this persona of \"the Jellybean Lady\", including colourful clothing to play well on television, as a fun way to engage people's attention while being easily identifiable.

A high-profile investigation on ''A Current Affair'' involved a beauty therapist who claimed that she could cure cancer by injecting sufferers with a [[Miracle Mineral Solution|mixture of citric acid and sodium chlorite]]. Marron's under-cover investigation was covered on national television, including showing the practitioner mixing up and injecting the mixture into Maria Worth, who was dying of breast cancer and paid $2000 for the \"treatment\". Four days later, Worth was in the emergency ward at Toowoomba Hospital with life-threatening blood clots.
