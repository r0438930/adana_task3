The team played its home games at [[Swangard Stadium]] in nearby [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]]. The team's colours were blue and white.\n\nOn March 19, 2009, an ownership group led by principal Greg Kerfoot was granted a [[Major League Soccer]] expansion franchise which began play in 2011 under the name [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]].\n\nIn addition to its men's side the Whitecaps also field a [[Vancouver Whitecaps Women|women's team]] in the [[USL W-League]], two developmental teams ([[Vancouver Whitecaps Residency]], in the [[USL Premier Development League]], and the [[Whitecaps FC Prospects]], in the [[Pacific Coast Soccer League]]), and four youth teams in the USL [[Super Y-League]] ([[Whitecaps FC Academy|Coastal WFC, Mountain WFC, Surrey WFC and Okanagan WFC]]) ranging in age from U13 to U17 for both boys and girls.<ref>[http://www.whitecapsfc.com/youth/teams/super_y_affiliates/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915075213/http://www.whitecapsfc.com/youth/teams/super_y_affiliates/ |date=September 15, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe team was previously known as the '''Vancouver 86ers''' of both the [[Canadian Soccer League (1987\u20131992)|Canadian Soccer League]], [[American Professional Soccer League]] (APSL), and later the [[A-League (1995\u20132004)|A-League]].

The 86ers went on to finish second in the Western Division standings that year before bowing out to inaugural league champions [[Calgary Kickers]] in the playoff semifinals. The 86ers played in the [[Canadian Soccer League (1987\u20131992)|Canadian Soccer League]] (CSL) winning four straight CSL Championships (1988\u20131991) and five consecutive CSL regular-season first-place finishes (1988\u201392).\n\nIn 1988\u20131989, the team, coached by [[Bob Lenarduzzi]], set a North American professional sports record by playing 46 consecutive games without a loss.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcsportshalloffame.com/inductees/inductees/bio?id=44&type=team|title=2004 Team Induction&nbsp;\u2013 1989 Vancouver 86ers|work=BC Sports Hall of Fame|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}</ref>  Also in 1988 the Vancouver 86ers and Calgary Kickers played six friendly matches each against the [[Western Soccer Alliance]] in the month of May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://a-leaguearchive.tripod.com/1988/resultswsa88.htm |title=WSA 1988 Season |publisher=A-leaguearchive.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, the Vancouver 86ers captured the North American Club Championship after defeating the [[Maryland Bays]] 3\u20132 in the final played in Burnaby. The game was played between the champions of the [[Canadian Soccer League (1987\u20131992)|Canadian Soccer League]] and the champions of the [[American Professional Soccer League]] (APSL).   The 86ers however came up short in the first round of the 1992 [[Professional Cup]] North American Club Championship. Facing APSL champions [[Colorado Foxes]] over two legs, Vancouver suffered a heartbreaking 3\u20132 defeat in the first leg in Colorado on August 3, 1992, before the Foxes advanced to the final, as a 2\u20131 second-leg win at Swangard on August 11, 1992, secured a 5\u20133 aggregate victory for Colorado.  Vancouver played in the CSL from its inception in 1987 until the league folded in 1992, and then moved over to the APSL in 1993 which was later absorbed into the USL hierarchy of leagues in 1997 becoming the [[American Professional Soccer League|A-League]], later renamed the [[USL First Division|USL]].\n\n===Vancouver Whitecaps (USL)===\n[[Image:Vancouver-Whitecaps-FC-Logo.svg|150px|logo|thumb|right|Vancouver Whitecaps USL]]\nIn 2001, the team began to use the old Vancouver Whitecaps moniker (signifying both the 'white caps' of the nearby mountains, and the waves of the [[Pacific Ocean]]). \nIn 2003, the name was again changed, albeit only slightly, to Whitecaps FC, which encompasses the men's, women's, and youth development teams within the organization. At this time, the Whitecaps logo changed slightly in colour (the light teal-green was replaced with a brighter blue) and the word \"Vancouver\" was dropped from the image.\n\nIn 2006, the Whitecaps organization won an unprecedented double-championship, claiming both the [[USL First Division|United Soccer Leagues First Division]] championship trophy, defeating the host [[Rochester Rhinos]] 3\u20130 at PAETEC Park, and winning the W-League women's trophy. The men's team also won the Nation's Cup, a new tournament established by their club as a way to feature the Whitecaps playing against international competition. The 2006 Nation's Cup tournament featured the Chinese and Indian U-20 National teams and [[Football League Championship|Championship]] Welsh club [[Cardiff City F.C.]] (the \"Bluebirds\"). The gradually added the \"Vancouver\" back into their name, changing it officially to \"Vancouver Whitecaps FC\".\n\nThe following season, the Whitecaps signed a deal to play an exhibition match against the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], which featured international [[David Beckham]], and promoted Director of Soccer Operations [[Bob Lenarduzzi]] to team president.\n\nOctober 12, 2008, they claimed their second United Soccer Leagues First Division championship with a 2\u20131 victory over the [[Puerto Rico Islanders]]. [[Charles Gbeke]] scored twice with his head in the second half to help secure the title. In 2009, they placed 7th in the league and were eliminated in the final by the [[Montreal Impact]] on a 6\u20133 aggregate.<ref>{{Cite news\n| url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/375255.html\n| title=Montreal wins USL-1 title\n| publisher=www.uslsoccer.com\n| date=October 17, 2009\n| accessdate=January 9, 2010\n| url-status=dead\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514205425/http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/375255.html\n| archivedate=May 14, 2011\n| df=mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2009 the Whitecaps, along with several other teams, announced their intent to leave the USL First Division to become the co-founders of a new [[North American Soccer League (2010)|North American Soccer League]], which was to begin play in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbyives.net/soccer_by_ives/2009/11/usl-outcasts-set-to-launch-new-league-in-2010.html |title=USL outcasts set to launch new league in 2010 |publisher=Soccerbyives.net |date=November 10, 2009 |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Molinaro |first=John F. |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/story/2009/11/10/sp-usl-new-league.html |title=CBC Sports: Whitecaps, Impact to form breakaway league |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=November 10, 2009 |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}</ref> On January 7, 2010 the [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S.S.F.]] announced that neither the USL nor the NASL would be permitted to have a second division league,<ref>{{Cite news\n| url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/66/united-states/2010/01/07/1731779/us-soccer-federation-to-oversee-combined-naslusl-league\n| title=US Soccer Federation To Oversee Combined NASL/USL League\n| publisher=Goal.com\n| date=January 7, 2010\n| accessdate=January 8, 2010\n}}</ref>\nand the USSF would administer a league where the NASL and USL are conferences within the league.<ref>{{Cite news\n| url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/soccer/2010/01/07/12384771-qmi.html\n| title=Impact, Whitecaps join new league\n| publisher=Toronto Sun\n| date=January 7, 2010\n| accessdate=January 8, 2010\n}}</ref>\n\nOn November 24, 2009 it was announced that [[Paul Barber (soccer administrator)|Paul Barber]], the former Executive Director of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], will become the Chief Executive Operations director of the Caps.<ref>[http://www.whitecapsfc.com/archive/feature11240902.aspx Whitecaps appoint CEO from EPL club]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\nWhitecaps played a 30-match regular season, with 15 home games and a 15 games away in the [[USSF Division 2 Professional League|United States Soccer Federation Division 2 Professional League]].<ref>[http://www.whitecapsfc.com/archive/feature02081002.aspx 2010 regular season announced]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\n===The Whitecaps and Major League Soccer===\n{{Main article|Vancouver Whitecaps FC}}\nOn July 24, 2008, the MLS announced they were seeking to add two expansion franchises for the 2011 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20080724&content_id=175344&vkey=pr_mls&fext=.jsp |title=Major League Soccer: News: Article |publisher=Web.mlsnet.com |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}</ref> One day later, the Whitecaps officially announced that they were pursuing one of the two expansion slots.

The new stadium was to be built over the railway tracks east of [[Waterfront Station (Vancouver)|Waterfront Station]] on Burrard Inlet.\n\nThis 16,000 seat stadium would have replaced [[Swangard Stadium]] as the home field for the [[USL First Division|USL]]'s Vancouver Whitecaps.\n\nThere was a fair degree of controversy with regards to this location; a Vancouver council session to debate the issue was extended to four nights to allow public input. Detractors viewed the proposed stadium as an incongruous addition to nearby historic [[Gastown]] that would block waterfront access and promote piecemeal development of the area. Proponents of the development felt that the stadium would attract new business to the downtown and Gastown areas, particularly since the soccer team tended to attract a family-oriented audience.\n\nOn July 11, 2006, [[Vancouver City Council]] voted unanimously to proceed with the stadium project, so long as the Whitecaps could meet certain conditions regarding land use. On January 22, 2007, the Whitecaps filed a new proposal shifting the proposed site for the stadium project to the current location of the SeaBus terminal, a short distance northwest of the previous site.\n\nWith the Whitecaps moving up to MLS, the franchise has signed to initially play at [[Empire Field]], and then [[BC Place Stadium]] from 2011 to at least 2015. It was hoped that the new facility would be completed by the 2016 MLS season. Due the hurdles of getting the new stadium approved, the project has been abandoned with the team committed to playing at [[BC Place Stadium]].\n\n==Club culture==\n\n===Mascot===\n\nThe Whitecaps' mascot was named Winger. He is a bird who wears a Whitecaps jersey and carries a large drum to encourage the crowd. He often uses signs to get fans in the grandstands to cheer.\n\n===Fans===\n{{details|Vancouver Southsiders}}\n\nThe Whitecaps have an independent supporters group known as the ''[[Vancouver Southsiders|Southsiders]]''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100224082627/http://www.whitecapsfc.com/matchday/supporters/ The Official Supporters Group of The Vancouver Whitecaps (USSF D2)]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversouthsiders.com |title=Vancouver Southsiders |publisher=Vancouver Southsiders |date= |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}</ref> Founded in 1999, the group is named for their preferred seating area in the south end of Swangard Stadium.

The name was changed to \"The Canterbury Chorus\" for the subsequent season, as the beer sponsorship had changed between seasons. To avoid changing names every time the sponsor changed, the group chose the name \"The Southsiders\".<ref>[http://www.vancouversouthsiders.ca/history.html/, The Southsiders Official Homepage.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722215059/http://vancouversouthsiders.ca/history.html/, |date=July 22, 2012 }} Retrieved on July 22, 2010.</ref>\n\n===Rival clubs===\nThe Vancouver Whitecaps have two historic rivals, the Pacific Northwest [[Portland Timbers (2001\u201310)|Portland Timbers]] and [[Seattle Sounders (1994\u20132008)|Seattle Sounders]]. These three teams competed in the yearly [[Cascadia Cup]] through 2008. In 2009, the Cup involved only the Whitecaps and Timbers because the Sounders were replaced by [[Seattle Sounders FC|an MLS team of the same name]].\n\nThe Whitecaps also compete on a yearly basis with the [[Montreal Impact]] and [[Toronto FC]] for the [[Voyageurs Cup]] or [[Canadian Championship]].

The team played its home games at [[Swangard Stadium]] in nearby [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]]. The team's colours were blue and white.\n\nOn March 19, 2009, an ownership group led by principal Greg Kerfoot was granted a [[Major League Soccer]] expansion franchise which began play in 2011 under the name [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]].\n\nIn addition to its men's side the Whitecaps also field a [[Vancouver Whitecaps Women|women's team]] in the [[USL W-League]], two developmental teams ([[Vancouver Whitecaps Residency]], in the [[USL Premier Development League]], and the [[Whitecaps FC Prospects]], in the [[Pacific Coast Soccer League]]), and four youth teams in the USL [[Super Y-League]] ([[Whitecaps FC Academy|Coastal WFC, Mountain WFC, Surrey WFC and Okanagan WFC]]) ranging in age from U13 to U17 for both boys and girls.<ref>[http://www.whitecapsfc.com/youth/teams/super_y_affiliates/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915075213/http://www.whitecapsfc.com/youth/teams/super_y_affiliates/ |date=September 15, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe team was previously known as the '''Vancouver 86ers''' of both the [[Canadian Soccer League (1987\u20131992)|Canadian Soccer League]], [[American Professional Soccer League]] (APSL), and later the [[A-League (1995\u20132004)|A-League]].

The 86ers went on to finish second in the Western Division standings that year before bowing out to inaugural league champions [[Calgary Kickers]] in the playoff semifinals. The 86ers played in the [[Canadian Soccer League (1987\u20131992)|Canadian Soccer League]] (CSL) winning four straight CSL Championships (1988\u20131991) and five consecutive CSL regular-season first-place finishes (1988\u201392).\n\nIn 1988\u20131989, the team, coached by [[Bob Lenarduzzi]], set a North American professional sports record by playing 46 consecutive games without a loss.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcsportshalloffame.com/inductees/inductees/bio?id=44&type=team|title=2004 Team Induction&nbsp;\u2013 1989 Vancouver 86ers|work=BC Sports Hall of Fame|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}</ref>  Also in 1988 the Vancouver 86ers and Calgary Kickers played six friendly matches each against the [[Western Soccer Alliance]] in the month of May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://a-leaguearchive.tripod.com/1988/resultswsa88.htm |title=WSA 1988 Season |publisher=A-leaguearchive.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, the Vancouver 86ers captured the North American Club Championship after defeating the [[Maryland Bays]] 3\u20132 in the final played in Burnaby. The game was played between the champions of the [[Canadian Soccer League (1987\u20131992)|Canadian Soccer League]] and the champions of the [[American Professional Soccer League]] (APSL).   The 86ers however came up short in the first round of the 1992 [[Professional Cup]] North American Club Championship. Facing APSL champions [[Colorado Foxes]] over two legs, Vancouver suffered a heartbreaking 3\u20132 defeat in the first leg in Colorado on August 3, 1992, before the Foxes advanced to the final, as a 2\u20131 second-leg win at Swangard on August 11, 1992, secured a 5\u20133 aggregate victory for Colorado.  Vancouver played in the CSL from its inception in 1987 until the league folded in 1992, and then moved over to the APSL in 1993 which was later absorbed into the USL hierarchy of leagues in 1997 becoming the [[American Professional Soccer League|A-League]], later renamed the [[USL First Division|USL]].\n\n===Vancouver Whitecaps (USL)===\n[[Image:Vancouver-Whitecaps-FC-Logo.svg|150px|logo|thumb|right|Vancouver Whitecaps USL]]\nIn 2001, the team began to use the old Vancouver Whitecaps moniker (signifying both the 'white caps' of the nearby mountains, and the waves of the [[Pacific Ocean]]). \nIn 2003, the name was again changed, albeit only slightly, to Whitecaps FC, which encompasses the men's, women's, and youth development teams within the organization. At this time, the Whitecaps logo changed slightly in colour (the light teal-green was replaced with a brighter blue) and the word \"Vancouver\" was dropped from the image.\n\nIn 2006, the Whitecaps organization won an unprecedented double-championship, claiming both the [[USL First Division|United Soccer Leagues First Division]] championship trophy, defeating the host [[Rochester Rhinos]] 3\u20130 at PAETEC Park, and winning the W-League women's trophy. The men's team also won the Nation's Cup, a new tournament established by their club as a way to feature the Whitecaps playing against international competition. The 2006 Nation's Cup tournament featured the Chinese and Indian U-20 National teams and [[Football League Championship|Championship]] Welsh club [[Cardiff City F.C.]] (the \"Bluebirds\").

The new stadium was to be built over the railway tracks east of [[Waterfront Station (Vancouver)|Waterfront Station]] on Burrard Inlet.\n\nThis 16,000 seat stadium would have replaced [[Swangard Stadium]] as the home field for the [[USL First Division|USL]]'s Vancouver Whitecaps.\n\nThere was a fair degree of controversy with regards to this location; a Vancouver council session to debate the issue was extended to four nights to allow public input. Detractors viewed the proposed stadium as an incongruous addition to nearby historic [[Gastown]] that would block waterfront access and promote piecemeal development of the area. Proponents of the development felt that the stadium would attract new business to the downtown and Gastown areas, particularly since the soccer team tended to attract a family-oriented audience.\n\nOn July 11, 2006, [[Vancouver City Council]] voted unanimously to proceed with the stadium project, so long as the Whitecaps could meet certain conditions regarding land use. On January 22, 2007, the Whitecaps filed a new proposal shifting the proposed site for the stadium project to the current location of the SeaBus terminal, a short distance northwest of the previous site.\n\nWith the Whitecaps moving up to MLS, the franchise has signed to initially play at [[Empire Field]], and then [[BC Place Stadium]] from 2011 to at least 2015. It was hoped that the new facility would be completed by the 2016 MLS season. Due the hurdles of getting the new stadium approved, the project has been abandoned with the team committed to playing at [[BC Place Stadium]].\n\n==Club culture==\n\n===Mascot===\n\nThe Whitecaps' mascot was named Winger. He is a bird who wears a Whitecaps jersey and carries a large drum to encourage the crowd. He often uses signs to get fans in the grandstands to cheer.\n\n===Fans===\n{{details|Vancouver Southsiders}}\n\nThe Whitecaps have an independent supporters group known as the ''[[Vancouver Southsiders|Southsiders]]''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100224082627/http://www.whitecapsfc.com/matchday/supporters/ The Official Supporters Group of The Vancouver Whitecaps (USSF D2)]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversouthsiders.com |title=Vancouver Southsiders |publisher=Vancouver Southsiders |date= |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}</ref> Founded in 1999, the group is named for their preferred seating area in the south end of Swangard Stadium.

The name was changed to \"The Canterbury Chorus\" for the subsequent season, as the beer sponsorship had changed between seasons. To avoid changing names every time the sponsor changed, the group chose the name \"The Southsiders\".<ref>[http://www.vancouversouthsiders.ca/history.html/, The Southsiders Official Homepage.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722215059/http://vancouversouthsiders.ca/history.html/, |date=July 22, 2012 }} Retrieved on July 22, 2010.</ref>\n\n===Rival clubs===\nThe Vancouver Whitecaps have two historic rivals, the Pacific Northwest [[Portland Timbers (2001\u201310)|Portland Timbers]] and [[Seattle Sounders (1994\u20132008)|Seattle Sounders]]. These three teams competed in the yearly [[Cascadia Cup]] through 2008. In 2009, the Cup involved only the Whitecaps and Timbers because the Sounders were replaced by [[Seattle Sounders FC|an MLS team of the same name]].\n\nThe Whitecaps also compete on a yearly basis with the [[Montreal Impact]] and [[Toronto FC]] for the [[Voyageurs Cup]] or [[Canadian Championship]]. The winner of this series advances to the [[CONCACAF Champions League]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|1=http://www.whitecapsfc.com}}\n\n{{Vancouver Whitecaps FC}}\n{{USSFD2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vancouver Whitecaps Fc}}\n[[Category:A-League (1995\u20132004) teams]]\n[[Category:American Professional Soccer League teams based in Canada]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1986]]\n[[Category:Canadian Soccer League (1986\u20131992) teams]]\n[[Category:Former USL First Division teams]]\n[[Category:United Soccer League teams based in Canada]]\n[[Category:Vancouver Whitecaps (1986\u20132010)| ]]\n[[Category:1986 establishments in British Columbia]]\n[[Category:2010 disestablishments in British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 2010]]\n\n[[da:Vancouver Whitecaps]]\n[[it:Vancouver Whitecaps]]\n", "name_user": "Jellyman", "label": "safe", "comment": "removed additional links from hatnote as perWP:HATEXTRA", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Whitecaps_(1986%E2%80%932010)"}
