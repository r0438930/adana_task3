It was announced at the company's [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|Worldwide Developers Conference]] on June 5, 2017, and released on September 19, 2017. It was succeeded by [[iOS 12]] on September 17, 2018.\n\n==Changes==\nAmong iOS 11's changes: the lock screen and Notification Center were combined, allowing all notifications to be displayed directly on the lock screen. The various pages of the Control Center were unified, gaining custom settings and the ability to [[3D Touch]] icons for more options. The [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] received a visual overhaul to focus on editorial content and daily highlights. A \"[[Files (Apple)|Files]]\" [[file manager]] app allowed direct access to files stored locally and in cloud services. [[Siri]] was updated to translate between languages and use a privacy-minded \"on-device learning\" technique to better understand a user's interests and offer suggestions. The camera had new settings for improved portrait-mode photos and utilised new encoding technologies to reduce file sizes on newer devices. In a later release, [[Messages (Apple)|Messages]] was integrated with iCloud to better synchronize messages across iOS and [[macOS]] devices. A previous point release also added support for person-to-person [[Apple Pay]] payments. The operating system also introduced the ability to record the screen, limited forms of drag-and-drop functionality, and support for [[augmented reality]]. Certain new features appeared only on [[iPad]], including an always-accessible application dock, cross-app drag-and-drop, and a new user interface to show multiple apps at once.\n\nOn June 4, 2018, at the Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced its successor, [[iOS 12]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Further|iOS version history#iOS 11}}\n\n=== Introduction and initial release ===\niOS 11 was introduced at the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] keynote address on June 5, 2017.<ref name=\"Announcement\">{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Welch |title=Apple announces iOS 11 with new features and better iPad productivity |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15732070/apple-ios-11-announced-iphone-update-new-features-wwdc-2017 |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 5, 2017 |access-date=June 8, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607065610/https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15732070/apple-ios-11-announced-iphone-update-new-features-wwdc-2017 |archive-date=June 7, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"9to5Mac announcement\">{{cite web |first=Zac |last=Hall |title=Apple unveils iOS 11 for iPhone and iPad |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/05/apple-unveils-ios-11-for-iphone-and-ipad/ |website=9to5Mac |date=June 5, 2017 |access-date=June 5, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606050633/https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/05/apple-unveils-ios-11-for-iphone-and-ipad/ |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Romain |last=Dillet |title=Apple introduces iOS 11 |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-introduces-ios-11/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 5, 2017 |access-date=June 5, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605182147/https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-introduces-ios-11/ |archive-date=June 5, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The first developer [[beta version]] was released after the keynote presentation,<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=First Beta of iOS 11 Now Available for Developers |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/05/first-beta-of-ios-11-now-available/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=June 5, 2017 |access-date=June 5, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607080121/https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/05/first-beta-of-ios-11-now-available/ |archive-date=June 7, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> with the first public beta released on June 26, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Releases First Public Beta of iOS 11 to Public Beta Testers |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/26/ios-11-first-public-beta/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=June 26, 2017 |access-date=June 26, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626202333/https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/26/ios-11-first-public-beta/ |archive-date=June 26, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\niOS 11 was officially released on September 19, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Releases iOS 11 With Revamped Lock Screen, Fresh App Store, New Siri Voice, and Updated iPad Interface |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/19/apple-releases-ios-11/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=September 19, 2017 |access-date=October 13, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001182547/https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/19/apple-releases-ios-11/ |archive-date=October 1, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Updates ===\n==== 11.0.1 ====\niOS 11.0.1 was released on September 26, 2017, as the first update to iOS 11.

Critics highly praised the application dock and new multitasking interface on the iPad, crediting them for renewing the user experience. Further praise was directed at the redesigned Control Center offering customizable toggles, though it was criticized for lack of third-party app support, lack of Wi-Fi network selection ability and for difficult usage on small screen sizes, along with its instability. Critics also noted the new augmented reality development tools, but said their impact would depend on third-party apps and how fast developers embraced them. Praise was also directed at the App Store's redesign and the new file-management tools. Shortly after release, it was discovered that disabling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections through the Control Center does not disable the respective chips in the device in order to remain functional for background connectivity, a design decision sparking criticism for \"misleading\" users and reducing security due to potential vulnerabilities in inactive open connections. The iOS 11.2 update added warning messages and a new toggle color to explain the new functions. iOS 11 has also received continuous criticism from critics and end-users for its perceived stability and performance issues, particularly on older devices; Apple has issued numerous software updates to address such issues and has dedicated [[iOS 12]] mainly toward stability and performance improvements in response.\nTwo months after release, 52% of iOS devices were running iOS 11, a slower adoption rate than previous iOS versions. The number increased to 85% of devices by September 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/apple-ios-11-adoption-rate-85-percent-ios-12-launch-1911726|title=iOS 11 Adoption Rate Reaches 85 Percent Ahead of iOS 12 Launch|author=Sumit Chakraborty|date=September 5, 2018|website=Gadgets360}}</ref>\n\nDieter Bohn of ''[[The Verge]]'' liked the new Control Center setup, including customizable toggles and 3D Touch-expandable options, writing that \"there are a few panels that I'm really impressed with\", specifically highlighting the Apple TV remote as a possible replacement of the normal remote. He did, however, note the lack of third-party access to Control Center, with a hope for support in the future, and a lack of Wi-Fi network selection ability. He praised the screen-recording functionality, calling it \"super neat\". Bohn severely criticized the notifications view, writing that he has a \"very serious disagreement\" with Apple on how to manage it, elaborating that he prefers to use that screen as much as possible while stating that \"Apple's philosophy is that I'm trying way too hard\" to control speedy notifications. Bohn liked the new Files app, new drag-and-drop functionality on the home screen enabling users to drag multiple apps at once, and significantly praised multitasking on iPad. Writing that \"Multitasking on the iPad is a near-revelatory experience\", he enjoyed the application dock and the ability to place up to three apps on the screen at once with more freedom on placement. Bohn conceded that \"It's not as intuitive nor as simple ''{{sic|nor}}'' as easy to manipulate as a traditional windowing system like you'll get on a Mac, PC, or Chromebook\", but still praised it for being \"radically more powerful than what has ever been available on an iPad before\".

He also praised the Control Center design, calling it \"a great upgrade\", though also highlighting the inability to easily switch Wi-Fi networks. Snell noted that the App Store's design had been unchanged for years, but received a full redesign in iOS 11, and wrote that Apple's commitment to editorial pages was \"impressive\", making the App Store \"a richer, more fun experience\". Regarding the introduction of augmented reality, he stated that most apps using it were \"bad\", though some also \"mind-blowingly good\", adding that the \"huge potential\" depended on how third-party apps were using it. Snell also praised improvements to the iPad experience, including multitasking and drag-and-drop across apps, the latter of which he stated \"actually surpasses my expectations\" due to ease of use.

He also praised the design overhaul of the App Store, calling it \"a huge improvement compared to the previous App Store\", and also highlighted design changes in other apps, including \"a huge bold header with the name of the app or section\". Although he acknowledged that \"Many tech friends have told me that they hate this change\", Dillet stated that \"I think most people will like it. It\u2019s visually pleasing and distinctive\". He stated that augmented reality will become more relevant in the days following the iOS 11 release as third-party developers incorporate features into their apps, and praised Apple for creating the ARKit development tools as it \"makes it much easier to implement augmented reality features\". In conclusion, Dillet wrote that \"Ten years ago, iOS started as a constrained operating system.

He had mixed feelings about the Control Center, writing that, on small phone screen sizes, it \"feels like a jumbled mess\", and adding that true comfort may only be present with larger screens, a troubling situation for owners of non-Plus devices. However, he praised the ability to customize the buttons, including removing those the user never uses, and the ability to quickly record the screen or enable accessibility features. He called the new app designs \"attractive\", and favorably pointed out the new app drawer at the bottom of conversations in the Messages app, referring to it as \"a big improvement over the messy interface of last year\".

Headers not being aligned properly between different apps, elements not being centered, and different colors and sizing caused Diaz to write that \"When it comes to software, Apple\u2019s attention to detail is crumbling away\". However, he also looked back in history, mentioning that Apple Music's original design, a lack of optical typography alignment in the Calendar app, and previously-fixed iOS design mistakes being ported to the [[macOS]] software had established that \"This inconsistency and lack of attention to detail are not new at Apple\". He firmly stated: \"Perhaps this is inevitable, given the monumental task of having to update the operating system every year. But for a company that claims to have an obsessive attention to detail, this is not acceptable\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Jesus |last=Diaz |title=iOS 11 Sucks |url=https://www.fastcodesign.com/90143457/ios-11-sucks |website=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |publisher=Mansueto Ventures |date=September 19, 2017 |access-date=November 22, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118103954/https://www.fastcodesign.com/90143457/ios-11-sucks |archive-date=November 18, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn November 2017, ''[[Gizmodo]]''{{'}}s Adam Clark Estes wrote extensively on [[software bug]]s and product imperfections experienced while using iOS 11. Estes pointed to issues such as keyboard covering up messages and a disappearing reply field in the Messages app, the letter \"i\" converting to a Unicode symbol, and the screen becoming unresponsive, writing that \"The new operating system has turned my phone into a bug-infested carcass of its former self, and the frustration of trying to use it sometimes makes me want to die, too\". He also wrote on the aspect of technology becoming more advanced and sophisticated, explaining that \"back when the iPhone 4 came out [...] smartphones were a lot simpler. The cameras were joyfully crappy. The screens were small. The number of apps we could download and things we could connect to was paltry compared to today. [...] We should expect some bugs, I guess. More complex pieces of technology contain more points of failure, and I\u2019m oversimplifying the issue\". He concluded by theorizing on technological development, writing: \"However, I am trying to understand exactly how my life with computers veered so dramatically from the days of Windows 95 when nothing worked right, to the golden age of the iPhone 4 when everything seemed perfect, to now when just a handful of iOS bugs make me feel like the world is falling apart.

It was announced at the company's [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|Worldwide Developers Conference]] on June 5, 2017, and released on September 19, 2017. It was succeeded by [[iOS 12]] on September 17, 2018.\n\n==Changes==\nAmong iOS 11's changes: the lock screen and Notification Center were combined, allowing all notifications to be displayed directly on the lock screen. The various pages of the Control Center were unified, gaining custom settings and the ability to [[3D Touch]] icons for more options. The [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] received a visual overhaul to focus on editorial content and daily highlights. A \"[[Files (Apple)|Files]]\" [[file manager]] app allowed direct access to files stored locally and in cloud services. [[Siri]] was updated to translate between languages and use a privacy-minded \"on-device learning\" technique to better understand a user's interests and offer suggestions. The camera had new settings for improved portrait-mode photos and utilised new encoding technologies to reduce file sizes on newer devices. In a later release, [[Messages (Apple)|Messages]] was integrated with iCloud to better synchronize messages across iOS and [[macOS]] devices. A previous point release also added support for person-to-person [[Apple Pay]] payments. The operating system also introduced the ability to record the screen, limited forms of drag-and-drop functionality, and support for [[augmented reality]]. Certain new features appeared only on [[iPad]], including an always-accessible application dock, cross-app drag-and-drop, and a new user interface to show multiple apps at once.\n\nOn June 4, 2018, at the Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced its successor, [[iOS 12]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Further|iOS version history#iOS 11}}\n\n=== Introduction and initial release ===\niOS 11 was introduced at the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] keynote address on June 5, 2017.<ref name=\"Announcement\">{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Welch |title=Apple announces iOS 11 with new features and better iPad productivity |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15732070/apple-ios-11-announced-iphone-update-new-features-wwdc-2017 |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 5, 2017 |access-date=June 8, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607065610/https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15732070/apple-ios-11-announced-iphone-update-new-features-wwdc-2017 |archive-date=June 7, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"9to5Mac announcement\">{{cite web |first=Zac |last=Hall |title=Apple unveils iOS 11 for iPhone and iPad |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/05/apple-unveils-ios-11-for-iphone-and-ipad/ |website=9to5Mac |date=June 5, 2017 |access-date=June 5, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606050633/https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/05/apple-unveils-ios-11-for-iphone-and-ipad/ |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Romain |last=Dillet |title=Apple introduces iOS 11 |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-introduces-ios-11/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 5, 2017 |access-date=June 5, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605182147/https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-introduces-ios-11/ |archive-date=June 5, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The first developer [[beta version]] was released after the keynote presentation,<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=First Beta of iOS 11 Now Available for Developers |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/05/first-beta-of-ios-11-now-available/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=June 5, 2017 |access-date=June 5, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607080121/https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/05/first-beta-of-ios-11-now-available/ |archive-date=June 7, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> with the first public beta released on June 26, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Releases First Public Beta of iOS 11 to Public Beta Testers |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/26/ios-11-first-public-beta/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=June 26, 2017 |access-date=June 26, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626202333/https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/26/ios-11-first-public-beta/ |archive-date=June 26, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\niOS 11 was officially released on September 19, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Releases iOS 11 With Revamped Lock Screen, Fresh App Store, New Siri Voice, and Updated iPad Interface |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/19/apple-releases-ios-11/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=September 19, 2017 |access-date=October 13, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001182547/https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/19/apple-releases-ios-11/ |archive-date=October 1, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Updates ===\n==== 11.0.1 ====\niOS 11.0.1 was released on September 26, 2017, as the first update to iOS 11.

Critics highly praised the application dock and new multitasking interface on the iPad, crediting them for renewing the user experience. Further praise was directed at the redesigned Control Center offering customizable toggles, though it was criticized for lack of third-party app support, lack of Wi-Fi network selection ability and for difficult usage on small screen sizes, along with its instability. Critics also noted the new augmented reality development tools, but said their impact would depend on third-party apps and how fast developers embraced them. Praise was also directed at the App Store's redesign and the new file-management tools. Shortly after release, it was discovered that disabling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections through the Control Center does not disable the respective chips in the device in order to remain functional for background connectivity, a design decision sparking criticism for \"misleading\" users and reducing security due to potential vulnerabilities in inactive open connections. The iOS 11.2 update added warning messages and a new toggle color to explain the new functions. iOS 11 has also received continuous criticism from critics and end-users for its perceived stability and performance issues, particularly on older devices; Apple has issued numerous software updates to address such issues and has dedicated [[iOS 12]] mainly toward stability and performance improvements in response.\nTwo months after release, 52% of iOS devices were running iOS 11, a slower adoption rate than previous iOS versions. The number increased to 85% of devices by September 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/apple-ios-11-adoption-rate-85-percent-ios-12-launch-1911726|title=iOS 11 Adoption Rate Reaches 85 Percent Ahead of iOS 12 Launch|author=Sumit Chakraborty|date=September 5, 2018|website=Gadgets360}}</ref>\n\nDieter Bohn of ''[[The Verge]]'' liked the new Control Center setup, including customizable toggles and 3D Touch-expandable options, writing that \"there are a few panels that I'm really impressed with\", specifically highlighting the Apple TV remote as a possible replacement of the normal remote. He did, however, note the lack of third-party access to Control Center, with a hope for support in the future, and a lack of Wi-Fi network selection ability. He praised the screen-recording functionality, calling it \"super neat\". Bohn severely criticized the notifications view, writing that he has a \"very serious disagreement\" with Apple on how to manage it, elaborating that he prefers to use that screen as much as possible while stating that \"Apple's philosophy is that I'm trying way too hard\" to control speedy notifications. Bohn liked the new Files app, new drag-and-drop functionality on the home screen enabling users to drag multiple apps at once, and significantly praised multitasking on iPad. Writing that \"Multitasking on the iPad is a near-revelatory experience\", he enjoyed the application dock and the ability to place up to three apps on the screen at once with more freedom on placement. Bohn conceded that \"It's not as intuitive nor as simple ''{{sic|nor}}'' as easy to manipulate as a traditional windowing system like you'll get on a Mac, PC, or Chromebook\", but still praised it for being \"radically more powerful than what has ever been available on an iPad before\". Finally, Bohn praised Siri for improvements to the voice, highlighted augmented reality allowing for \"incredible games\", and reiterated an earlier sentiment that iOS 11 is \"the most ambitious software update from Apple in a very, very long time\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Dieter |last=Bohn |title=iOS 11 review: 10 things to try |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16328404/apple-ios-11-review-iphone-update-control-center-how-to |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 19, 2017 |access-date=October 14, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929054334/https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16328404/apple-ios-11-review-iphone-update-control-center-how-to |archive-date=September 29, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n''[[Macworld]]''{{'}}s Jason Snell wrote that the hype surrounding iOS 11 is \"justified\". Snell praised the new \"smoother\" transfer mode of data and settings between an old iPhone and a new iPhone, referring to the previous experience of doing it manually as \"a frustrating exercise in entering in passwords repeatedly while tapping through a long series of questions about activating or deactivating numerous iOS features\". He also praised the Control Center design, calling it \"a great upgrade\", though also highlighting the inability to easily switch Wi-Fi networks. Snell noted that the App Store's design had been unchanged for years, but received a full redesign in iOS 11, and wrote that Apple's commitment to editorial pages was \"impressive\", making the App Store \"a richer, more fun experience\".

He also praised the design overhaul of the App Store, calling it \"a huge improvement compared to the previous App Store\", and also highlighted design changes in other apps, including \"a huge bold header with the name of the app or section\". Although he acknowledged that \"Many tech friends have told me that they hate this change\", Dillet stated that \"I think most people will like it. It\u2019s visually pleasing and distinctive\". He stated that augmented reality will become more relevant in the days following the iOS 11 release as third-party developers incorporate features into their apps, and praised Apple for creating the ARKit development tools as it \"makes it much easier to implement augmented reality features\". In conclusion, Dillet wrote that \"Ten years ago, iOS started as a constrained operating system.

He had mixed feelings about the Control Center, writing that, on small phone screen sizes, it \"feels like a jumbled mess\", and adding that true comfort may only be present with larger screens, a troubling situation for owners of non-Plus devices. However, he praised the ability to customize the buttons, including removing those the user never uses, and the ability to quickly record the screen or enable accessibility features. He called the new app designs \"attractive\", and favorably pointed out the new app drawer at the bottom of conversations in the Messages app, referring to it as \"a big improvement over the messy interface of last year\". He praised Siri for an improved voice, the Photos app for creating better Memories, and new social features in Apple Music, though noting the lack of people in his social circle using the service. Referencing [[IKEA]]'s \"IKEA Place\" app, which uses augmented reality to virtually place objects in a room, he significantly praised the performance of the augmented reality technology on iPhone, writing that \"It did a great job of rendering furniture in physical spaces using both the iPhone 8, and, even more impressively, it ran smoothly on my iPhone 6S\". Finally, Hardawar also enjoyed new functionality on iPad, calling multitasking, the application dock and drag-and-drop \"dramatic changes\", and highlighting the \"particularly useful\" experience of dragging Internet content directly from the web into the new Files app. In summarization, he recognized the significant strides made for iPad with iOS 11, writing that \"it's a shame that iOS 11 doesn't bring more to the table on the iPhone\", though acknowledging the rise of augmented reality.<ref>{{cite web |first=Devindra |last=Hardawar |title=iOS 11 review: A big deal for iPads, but not iPhones |url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/19/apple-ios-11-review/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[Oath Inc.]] |date=September 19, 2017 |access-date=October 14, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014182542/https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/19/apple-ios-11-review/ |archive-date=October 14, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn November 2017, Apple's App Store support page was updated to reflect that 52% of iOS devices were running iOS 11,<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Says iOS 11 is Installed on 52% of Devices |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/07/ios-11-installed-on-52-percent-of-devices/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=November 7, 2017 |access-date=November 8, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108114700/https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/07/ios-11-installed-on-52-percent-of-devices/ |archive-date=November 8, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> a slower migration rate than for the release of iOS 10 the year prior, which saw 60% user adoption by October 2016.<ref>{{cite web |first=Chaim |last=Gartenberg |title=iOS 11 adoption hits 52 percent, lagging behind previous versions |url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/11/7/16621020/ios-11-adoption-52-percent-lagging-10-9-iphone-ipad-operating-system |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 7, 2017 |access-date=November 8, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108021348/https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/11/7/16621020/ios-11-adoption-52-percent-lagging-10-9-iphone-ipad-operating-system |archive-date=November 8, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The number increased to 59% of devices by December 2017.<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Says iOS 11 is Now Installed on 59% of Devices |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/05/ios-11-installation-59-percent/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=December 5, 2017 |access-date=December 6, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206000005/https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/05/ios-11-installation-59-percent/ |archive-date=December 6, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Ranger |title=iOS 11: Here's how many iPhones and iPads are running it now |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-11-heres-how-many-iphones-and-ipads-are-running-it-now/ |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=December 6, 2017 |access-date=December 6, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103113647/http://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-11-heres-how-many-iphones-and-ipads-are-running-it-now/ |archive-date=January 3, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Design inconsistencies and software bugs ===\nIn September 2017, Jesus Diaz of ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' criticized design details in iOS 11 and Apple's built-in apps not adhering to Apple's user interface guidelines. Headers not being aligned properly between different apps, elements not being centered, and different colors and sizing caused Diaz to write that \"When it comes to software, Apple\u2019s attention to detail is crumbling away\". However, he also looked back in history, mentioning that Apple Music's original design, a lack of optical typography alignment in the Calendar app, and previously-fixed iOS design mistakes being ported to the [[macOS]] software had established that \"This inconsistency and lack of attention to detail are not new at Apple\". He firmly stated: \"Perhaps this is inevitable, given the monumental task of having to update the operating system every year. But for a company that claims to have an obsessive attention to detail, this is not acceptable\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Jesus |last=Diaz |title=iOS 11 Sucks |url=https://www.fastcodesign.com/90143457/ios-11-sucks |website=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |publisher=Mansueto Ventures |date=September 19, 2017 |access-date=November 22, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118103954/https://www.fastcodesign.com/90143457/ios-11-sucks |archive-date=November 18, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn November 2017, ''[[Gizmodo]]''{{'}}s Adam Clark Estes wrote extensively on [[software bug]]s and product imperfections experienced while using iOS 11. Estes pointed to issues such as keyboard covering up messages and a disappearing reply field in the Messages app, the letter \"i\" converting to a Unicode symbol, and the screen becoming unresponsive, writing that \"The new operating system has turned my phone into a bug-infested carcass of its former self, and the frustration of trying to use it sometimes makes me want to die, too\". He also wrote on the aspect of technology becoming more advanced and sophisticated, explaining that \"back when the iPhone 4 came out [...] smartphones were a lot simpler. The cameras were joyfully crappy. The screens were small. The number of apps we could download and things we could connect to was paltry compared to today. [...] We should expect some bugs, I guess. More complex pieces of technology contain more points of failure, and I\u2019m oversimplifying the issue\". He concluded by theorizing on technological development, writing: \"However, I am trying to understand exactly how my life with computers veered so dramatically from the days of Windows 95 when nothing worked right, to the golden age of the iPhone 4 when everything seemed perfect, to now when just a handful of iOS bugs make me feel like the world is falling apart.
