The show played several large cities before reaching [[New York City]]. In mid-November, Adelaide travelled from [[Chicago]] (where she'd been performing) to [[New York City]] in her [[Packard]] automobile with her husband Bert. When they arrived in New York, Adelaide was approached in 7th Avenue by a reporter who enquired about her career plans.<ref>''The Pittsburgh Courier'', Pittsburgh, 19 November 1927, front page \u2013 'They Always Come Back For More,\u2019 says Adelaide \u2013 Adelaide Hall report & photograph: https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=30987648&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjQwMDA3ODExLCJpYXQiOjE1NzE0ODQ5NTEsImV4cCI6MTU3MTU3MTM1MX0.vQF9B_O3GWoXhj74SJP8_ICp4wIHl4jUNTrlrvKpgf0</ref> Adelaide, however, declined to enlighten the reporter. Nevertheless, Miss Hall's reappearance in [[New York City]] garnered much speculation, as she was featured on the front pages of several newspapers, encouraging rumours she would soon be starring in a big [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show. In the meantime, Hall and Ellington appeared together in ''Dance Mania'' at the [[Lafayette Theatre (Harlem)|Lafayette Theatre]], Harlem from 14 November for one week before heading off with the show to play in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the Standard Theatre.<ref>[http://www.ellingtonweb.ca/Hostedpages/TDWAW/DropdownmenuDRAFT.html#dec27 ''Dance Mania'' dates] listed on Ellingtonweb.</ref> In ''Dance Mania'' Hall closed the first half of the bill and Duke and his orchestra performed in the second half. Duke had a new number \"[[Creole Love Call]]\", which he included in his set. When Adelaide first heard the number back in October, she recounted, \n<blockquote>I was standing in the wings behind the piano when Duke first played it (\"[[Creole Love Call]]\"). I started humming along with the band. He stopped the number and came over to me and said, \"That's just what I was looking for. Can you do it again?\" I said, \"I can't, because I don't know what I was doing.\" He begged me to try. Anyway, I did, and sang this counter melody, and he was delighted and said \"Addie, you're going to record this with the band.\" A couple of days later I did.<ref name=Voce /></blockquote> \n[[File:Cotton Club 1930.jpg|thumb|[[Cotton Club]], [[Harlem]]]]\nWhen Duke was recounting the incident to a reporter he explained, \"We had to do something to employ Adelaide Hall,\" and then added, \"I always say we are primitive artists, we only employ the materials at hand \u2026 the band is an accumulation of personalities, tonal devices.\"<ref>David Bradbury, ''Duke Ellington'', Haus Publishing Ltd, 2005 ({{ISBN|1-904341-66-7}}), p. 19.</ref> On 4 December 1927, Ellington and his Orchestra commenced their residency at Harlem's [[Cotton Club]] in a revue called ''Rhythmania''.

Plus it also talks about how she'd had a hard time growing up, because her sister \u2013 who she was very close to \u2013 had died tragically of an illness.... So anyway, there's a point in the story where she describes her close relationship with her father, which I think kind of resonated with me \u2013 where she talks about the conversations she had with him and how he used to say to her randomly 'Sing to the moon and the stars will shine', which kind of became her thing really that she just took with her everywhere.... And I don't know why, but for some reason it just struck some kind of chord with me \u2013 you know, it was just something I seemed to connect with at that time. And so because of that, it then became a saying that I liked to use myself....

The show played several large cities before reaching [[New York City]]. In mid-November, Adelaide travelled from [[Chicago]] (where she'd been performing) to [[New York City]] in her [[Packard]] automobile with her husband Bert. When they arrived in New York, Adelaide was approached in 7th Avenue by a reporter who enquired about her career plans.<ref>''The Pittsburgh Courier'', Pittsburgh, 19 November 1927, front page \u2013 'They Always Come Back For More,\u2019 says Adelaide \u2013 Adelaide Hall report & photograph: https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=30987648&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjQwMDA3ODExLCJpYXQiOjE1NzE0ODQ5NTEsImV4cCI6MTU3MTU3MTM1MX0.vQF9B_O3GWoXhj74SJP8_ICp4wIHl4jUNTrlrvKpgf0</ref> Adelaide, however, declined to enlighten the reporter. Nevertheless, Miss Hall's reappearance in [[New York City]] garnered much speculation, as she was featured on the front pages of several newspapers, encouraging rumours she would soon be starring in a big [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show. In the meantime, Hall and Ellington appeared together in ''Dance Mania'' at the [[Lafayette Theatre (Harlem)|Lafayette Theatre]], Harlem from 14 November for one week before heading off with the show to play in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the Standard Theatre.<ref>[http://www.ellingtonweb.ca/Hostedpages/TDWAW/DropdownmenuDRAFT.html#dec27 ''Dance Mania'' dates] listed on Ellingtonweb.</ref> In ''Dance Mania'' Hall closed the first half of the bill and Duke and his orchestra performed in the second half. Duke had a new number \"[[Creole Love Call]]\", which he included in his set. When Adelaide first heard the number back in October, she recounted, \n<blockquote>I was standing in the wings behind the piano when Duke first played it (\"[[Creole Love Call]]\"). I started humming along with the band. He stopped the number and came over to me and said, \"That's just what I was looking for. Can you do it again?\" I said, \"I can't, because I don't know what I was doing.\" He begged me to try. Anyway, I did, and sang this counter melody, and he was delighted and said \"Addie, you're going to record this with the band.\" A couple of days later I did.<ref name=Voce /></blockquote> \n[[File:Cotton Club 1930.jpg|thumb|[[Cotton Club]], [[Harlem]]]]\nWhen Duke was recounting the incident to a reporter he explained, \"We had to do something to employ Adelaide Hall,\" and then added, \"I always say we are primitive artists, we only employ the materials at hand \u2026 the band is an accumulation of personalities, tonal devices.\"<ref>David Bradbury, ''Duke Ellington'', Haus Publishing Ltd, 2005 ({{ISBN|1-904341-66-7}}), p. 19.</ref> On 4 December 1927, Ellington and his Orchestra commenced their residency at Harlem's [[Cotton Club]] in a revue called ''Rhythmania''.

Today, I am proud that I am more than an actress\".</blockquote>\n\nTyler continues by asking about her forthcoming American and Canadian concert tour, which will take her deep into the South: \"What do you think of such a tour, under the conditions that exist in the South?\" Hall replied:\n\n<blockquote>My experience of a couple of years ago while on a coast-to-coast tour should serve me well.

Plus it also talks about how she'd had a hard time growing up, because her sister \u2013 who she was very close to \u2013 had died tragically of an illness.... So anyway, there's a point in the story where she describes her close relationship with her father, which I think kind of resonated with me \u2013 where she talks about the conversations she had with him and how he used to say to her randomly 'Sing to the moon and the stars will shine', which kind of became her thing really that she just took with her everywhere.... And I don't know why, but for some reason it just struck some kind of chord with me \u2013 you know, it was just something I seemed to connect with at that time. And so because of that, it then became a saying that I liked to use myself.... So yeah, because it's become something I personally like to express, I just thought 'Sing to the Moon' would also make a good title for the album as a whole.<ref name=\"bluesandsoul.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/826/great_expectations/|title=Laura Mvula: Reflections of...|author=Stephen Clark \u2013 Design|work=bluesandsoul.com}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn 11 August 2014, Mvula released her second album, an orchestral version of her top 10 debut album ''[[Sing to the Moon]]'',<ref>[http://www.bowers-wilkins.co.uk/Society_of_Sound/Society_of_Sound/Music/Laura-Mvula.html \"Laura Mvula releases orchestral recording of 'Sing to the Moon'\"].
