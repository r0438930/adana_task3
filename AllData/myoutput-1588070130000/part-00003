Heavy gradients in the [[Western Ghats]] necessitated the introduction of electric traction on the GIPR to [[Igatpuri]] on the North East line and [[Pune]] on the South East line. On 5 January 1928 1500 V DC traction was introduced on the suburban section of the [[Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway]] between [[Colaba]] and [[Borivili]], and between [[Madras]] Beach and [[Tambaram]] of the [[Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway]] on 11 May 1931, to meet growing traffic needs.<ref name=\"ELECT\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.core.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,294,302,532 |title=Brief on Railway Electrification |access-date=1 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926072829/http://www.core.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,294,302,532 |archive-date=26 September 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The 3000 V DC electrification of the [[Howrah]]-[[Burdwan]] section of the [[Eastern Railway Zone (India)|Eastern Railway]] was completed in 1958.

Indian Railways decided in 1957 to adopt 25 kV AC as its standard, with SNCF their consultant in the early stages. The first 25 kV AC section was Raj Kharswan\u2013Dongoaposi on the [[South Eastern Railway Zone, India|South Eastern Railway]] in 1960. The first 25 kV AC [[electric multiple unit|EMUs]], for [[Kolkata]] suburban service, began service in September 1962. For continuity, the Howrah\u2013Burdwan section of the Eastern Railway and the Madras Beach\u2013Tambaram section of the Southern Railway were converted to 25 kV AC by 1968. Because of limitations in the DC traction system, a decision was made to convert the electric traction system of the Mumbai suburban rail network of WR and CR from 1.5kV DC to 25 kV AC in 1996\u201397. The conversion from DC to AC traction was completed in 2012 by Western Railway, and in 2016 by Central Railway. Since then, the entire electrified mainline rail network in India uses 25 kV AC, and DC traction is used only for metros and trams.<ref name=\"ELECT\"/>\n\nIndian Railways announced on 31 March 2017 that the country's entire rail network would be electrified by 2022.<ref name=\"indianexpress.com\"/><ref name=\"enincon1\">{{cite web|url=https://enincon.com/report/railway-electrification-market-opportunities-in-india-2018/|title=Railway Electrification Market in India 2018|date=20 February 2018|publisher=Enincon|access-date=20 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320230336/https://enincon.com/report/railway-electrification-market-opportunities-in-india-2018/|archive-date=20 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThough not a nascent concept, the electrification in India now has been committed with a fresh investment of {{INRConvert|35000|c}} to electrify the entire network and eliminate the cost of fuel under transportation which will amount to a massive savings of {{INRConvert|10500|c}} overall.

[[Locomotive]]s in India are classified by gauge, motive power, the work they are suited for, and their power or model number. Their four- or five-letter class name includes this information. The first letter denotes the track gauge, the second their motive power (diesel or electric), and the third their suitable traffic (goods, passenger, multi or shunting). The fourth letter denoted the locomotive's chronological model number, but in 2002, a new classification was adopted in which the fourth letter in newer diesel locomotives indicate [[horsepower]] range.\n\nA locomotive may have a fifth letter in its name, denoting a technical variant, subclass, or sub-type (a variation in the basic model (or series) or a different motor or manufacturer). In the new diesel-locomotive classification, the fifth letter refines the horsepower in 100-hp increments: A for 100&nbsp;hp, B for 200&nbsp;hp, C for 300&nbsp;hp and so on. In this classification, a WDM-3A is a 3100&nbsp;hp, a WDM-3D a 3400&nbsp;hp and a WDM-3F a 3600&nbsp;hp locomotive.{{efn|This classification system does not apply to steam locomotives, which retained their original class names (such as M class or [[Indian locomotive class WP|WP class]]).}} Diesel locomotives are fitted with auxiliary power units, which save almost 88 percent of fuel during idle time when a train is not running.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Technology allows Railways to save Rs 20 Lakhs Diesel per Engine|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2013/09/new-technology-allows-railways-to-save-rs-20-lakhs-diesel-per-engine/|accessdate=6 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908145226/http://news.biharprabha.com/2013/09/new-technology-allows-railways-to-save-rs-20-lakhs-diesel-per-engine/|archive-date=8 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Goods wagons ===\n{{see also|Wagon numbering system in India|label 2=Wagon numbering system}}\nAs of March 2017, IR fleet consisted of 277,987 [[goods wagon]]s.

For continuity, the Howrah\u2013Burdwan section of the Eastern Railway and the Madras Beach\u2013Tambaram section of the Southern Railway were converted to 25 kV AC by 1968. Because of limitations in the DC traction system, a decision was made to convert the electric traction system of the Mumbai suburban rail network of WR and CR from 1.5kV DC to 25 kV AC in 1996\u201397. The conversion from DC to AC traction was completed in 2012 by Western Railway, and in 2016 by Central Railway.
