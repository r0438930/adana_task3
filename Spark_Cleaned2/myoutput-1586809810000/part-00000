He is particularly known for his mature work with gold-tooled lines on black leather. His work is held in high esteem, entering many public and private collections around the world, and fetching good prices at auction. He was also an influential teacher of bookbinding. He was awarded an MBE 'For Services to Bookbinding.'\n\n== Personal life and biography ==\n\nRobinson was born and raised in Bournemouth (then Hampshire; now Dorset), England.
