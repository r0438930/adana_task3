A candle can also provide [[heat]] or a method of keeping [[time]].\n\nA person who makes candles is traditionally known as a [[chandlery|chandler]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/chandler|title=Chandler |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref> Various devices have been invented to hold candles, from simple tabletop [[candlestick|candlesticks, also known as candle holders,]] to elaborate [[candelabra]] and  [[chandelier]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/chandelier |title=chandelier |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref>\n\nFor a candle to burn, a heat source (commonly a naked flame from a [[match]] or [[lighter]]) is used to light the candle's wick, which melts and [[vaporizes]] a small amount of fuel (the wax). Once vaporized, the fuel combines with [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere to ignite and form a constant [[flame]]. This flame provides sufficient heat to keep the candle burning via a self-sustaining chain of events: the heat of the flame melts the top of the mass of solid fuel; the liquefied fuel then moves upward through the wick via [[capillary action]]; the liquefied fuel finally vaporizes to burn within the candle's flame.\n\nAs the fuel (wax) is melted and burned, the candle becomes shorter. Portions of the wick that are not emitting vaporized fuel are consumed in the flame. The incineration of the wick limits the length of the exposed portion of the wick, thus maintaining a constant burning temperature and rate of fuel consumption. Some wicks require regular trimming with scissors (or a specialized wick trimmer), usually to about one-quarter inch (~0.7&nbsp;cm), to promote slower, steady burning, and also to prevent smoking. Special candle-scissors called \"[[Candle snuffer|snuffers]]\" were produced for this purpose in the 20th century and were often combined with an extinguisher. In modern candles, the wick is constructed so that it curves over as it burns.  This ensures that the end of the wick gets oxygen and is then consumed by [[fire]]\u2014a self-trimming wick.<ref>[http://www.eca-candles.com/design.php?rubrik=29&topnav=6&sprach_id=en&SID=ksqhyfiz European Candle Association FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113154928/http://www.eca-candles.com/design.php?rubrik=29&topnav=6&sprach_id=en&SID=ksqhyfiz |date=2012-01-13 }}.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word candle comes from Middle English ''candel'', from Old English and from Anglo-Norman ''candele'', both from Latin ''cand\u0113la'', from ''cand\u0113re'', to shine.<ref name=Farlex>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/candle |title=Candle |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of candle making}}\n[[File:Roman oil lamp.jpg|thumb|Roman oil lamp]]\nPrior to the candle, people used [[oil lamp]]s in which a lit wick rested in a container of liquid oil.

Important characteristics of the wick include diameter, stiffness, [[Fireproofing|fire-resistance]], and tethering.\n\nA candle wick is a piece of string or cord that holds the flame of a candle.  Commercial wicks are made from braided cotton.  The wick's [[capillary action|capillarity]] determines the rate at which the melted hydrocarbon is conveyed to the flame.  If the capillarity is too great, the molten wax streams down the side of the candle.  Wicks are often infused with a variety of [[chemical]]s to modify their burning characteristics.  For example, it is usually desirable that the wick not glow after the flame is extinguished.

The blue color is due to [[chemiluminescence]], while the visible yellow color is due to radiative emission from hot [[soot]] particles.  The soot is formed through a series of complex chemical reactions, leading from the fuel molecule through molecular growth, until multi-carbon ring compounds are formed.

It is located around the base of the wick where there is insufficient oxygen for fuel to burn.  Temperatures are around {{convert|600|C|F}}.\n* Zone II - this is the ''blue zone'' which surrounds the base of the flame.  Here the supply of oxygen is plentiful, and the fuel burns clean and blue.  It is heat from this zone which causes the wax to melt. Temperatures are around {{convert|800|C|F}}\n* Zone III - the ''dark zone'' is a region directly above the wick containing unburnt wax.  [[Pyrolysis]] takes place here.  Temperature is around {{convert|1000|C|F}}\n*Zone IV - the ''middle'' or ''luminous zone'' is yellow/ white and is located above the dark zone.  It is the brightest zone, but not the hottest.  It is an oxygen-depleted zone with insufficient oxygen to burn all of the wax vapor rising from below it resulting in only partial combustion. The zone also contains unburnt carbon particles. Temperature is around {{convert|1200|C|F}}.\n* Zone V - The non-luminous  ''outer zone'' or ''veil'' surrounds Zone IV.  Here the flame is at its hottest, at around {{convert|1400|C|F}}, and complete combustion occurs. It is light blue in color though most of it is invisible.<ref>{{cite web|work=Ohio State University|title=FTIR STUDY OF COMBUSTION SPECIES IN SEVERAL REGIONS OF A CANDLE FLAME|url=https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/55436|accessdate=26 January 2019|author=Allen R.

The best way to avoid getting burned from splashed wax is to use a [[candle snuffer]] instead of blowing on the flame. A candle snuffer is usually a small metal cup on the end of a long handle. Placing the snuffer over the flame cuts off the oxygen supply. Snuffers were common in the home when candles were the main source of lighting before electric lights were available.  Ornate snuffers, often combined with a taper for lighting, are still found in those churches which regularly use large candles.\n\nGlass candle-holders are sometimes cracked by thermal shock from the candle flame, particularly when the candle burns down to the end. When burning candles in glass holders or jars, users should avoid lighting candles with chipped or cracked containers, and stop use once 1/2&nbsp;inch or less of wax remains.\n\nA former worry regarding the safety of candles was that a [[lead]] core was used in the wicks to keep them upright in container candles. Without a stiff core, the wicks of a container candle could sag and drown in the deep wax pool. Concerns rose that the lead in these wicks would vaporize during the burning process, releasing lead vapors \u2014 a known health and developmental hazard. Lead core wicks have not been common since the 1970s. Today, most metal-cored wicks use [[zinc]] or a zinc [[alloy]], which has become the industry standard. Wicks made from specially treated paper and cotton are also available.\n\n==Regulation==\nInternational markets have developed a range of standards and [[regulation]]s to ensure compliance, while maintaining and improving [[safety]], including:\n* Europe: GPSD, EN 15493, EN 15494, EN 15426, EN 14059, [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]], RAL-GZ 041 Candles (Germany), French Decree 91-1175\n* United States: ASTM F2058, ASTM F2179, ASTM F2417, ASTM F2601, ASTM F2326, [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|California Proposition 65]], CONEG\n* China: QB/T 2119 Basic Candle, QB/T 2902 Art Candle, QB/T 2903 Jar Candle, GB/T 22256 Jelly Candle\n\n==Accessories==\n[[File:Wick-Trimmer.jpg|thumb|Wick-trimmer]]\n===Candle holders===\nDecorative candleholders, especially those shaped as a pedestal, are called [[candlestick]]s; if multiple candle tapers are held, the term ''candelabrum'' is also used. The root form of ''[[chandelier]]'' is from the word for candle, but now usually refers to an electric fixture. The word ''chandelier'' is sometimes now used to describe a hanging fixture designed to hold multiple tapers.\n\nMany candle holders use a friction-tight socket to keep the candle upright. In this case, a candle that is slightly too wide will not fit in the holder, and a candle that is slightly too narrow will wobble. Candles that are too big can be trimmed to fit with a knife; candles that are too small can be fitted with aluminium foil. Traditionally, the candle and candle holders were made in the same place, so they were appropriately sized, but [[common market|international trade]] has combined the modern candle with existing holders, which makes the ill-fitting candle more common. This friction tight socket is only needed for the federals and the tapers. For [[tea light]] candles, there is a variety of candle holders, including small glass holders and elaborate multi-candle stands. The same is true for [[votive candle|votives]]. Wall sconces are available for tea light and votive candles. For pillar-type candles, the assortment of candle holders is broad. A fireproof plate, such as a glass plate or small mirror, can be a candle holder for a pillar-style candle. A pedestal of any kind, with the appropriate-sized fireproof top, is another option. A large glass bowl with a large flat bottom and tall mostly vertical curved sides is called a hurricane. The pillar-style candle is placed at the bottom center of the hurricane. A hurricane on a pedestal is sometimes sold as a unit.\n\nA [[bob\u00e8che]] is a drip-catching ring, which may also be affixed to a candle holder, or used independently of one. Bob\u00e8ches can range from ornate metal or glass to simple plastic, cardboard, or wax paper. Use of paper or plastic bob\u00e8ches is common at events where candles are distributed to a crowd or audience, such as Christmas carolers or people at other concerts/festivals.\n\n===Candle followers===\nThese are glass or metal tubes with an internal stricture partway along, which sit around the top of a lit candle. As the candle burns, the wax melts and the follower holds the melted wax in, whilst the stricture rests on the topmost solid portion of wax. Candle followers are often deliberately heavy or weighted to ensure they move down as the candle burns lower, maintaining a seal and preventing wax escape. The purpose of a candle follower is threefold:\n* To contain the melted wax, making the candle more efficient, avoiding mess, and producing a more even burn.\n* As a decoration, either due to the ornate nature of the device, or (in the case of a glass follower) through light dispersion or colouration.\n* If necessary, to shield the flame from wind.\n\nCandle followers are often found in churches on [[altar candle]]s.\n\n===Candle snuffers===\n{{main|Candle snuffer}}\nCandle snuffers are instruments used to extinguish burning candles by smothering the flame with a small metal cup that is suspended from a long handle, and thus depriving it of oxygen. An older meaning refers to a scissor-like tool used to trim the wick of a candle. With skill, this could be done without extinguishing the flame. The instrument now known as a candle snuffer was formerly called an \"extinguisher\" or \"douter\".\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Candle-making]]\n* [[Candle warmer]]\n* [[Candelabra]]\n* [[Julleuchter]]\n* [[Outdoor candle]]\n* [[Rushlight]]\n* [[Singing candle]]\n* [[Tealight]]\n* [[Trick candles]]\n* [[Trudon]]\n* [[Unity candle]]\n* [[Yahrzeit candle]]{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Candles}}\n{{CE1913 poster|Candles}}\n* {{Commons category-inline|Candles}}\n* [http://www.candles.org/ National Candle Association] of the [[United States|U.S.]]\n* [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14474 The Chemical History of a Candle] by Michael Faraday\n* [http://www.europecandles.org/ Association of European Candlemakers(AECM)]\n* [http://www.eca-candles.eu/ European Candle Association (ECA)]\n* [http://www.alafave.org/ Latin American Candle Manufacturers Association (ALAFAVE)]\n* [https://www.osmology.co/blog/candle-safety/ Guide To Candle Safety At Home - Osmology]\n\n{{Artificial light sources}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Candles| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n[[File:LA2 Skultuna kontorsljusstake.jpg|thumb|upright|A candle in a candle stick]]\n\nA '''candle''' is an ignitable [[candle wick|wick]] embedded in [[wax]], or another flammable solid substance such as [[tallow]], that provides [[light]], and in some cases, a [[Aroma compound|fragrance]].  A candle can also provide [[heat]] or a method of keeping [[time]].\n\nA person who makes candles is traditionally known as a [[chandlery|chandler]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/chandler|title=Chandler |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref> Various devices have been invented to hold candles, from simple tabletop [[candlestick|candlesticks, also known as candle holders,]] to elaborate [[candelabra]] and  [[chandelier]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/chandelier |title=chandelier |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref>\n\nFor a candle to burn, a heat source (commonly a naked flame from a [[match]] or [[lighter]]) is used to light the candle's wick, which melts and [[vaporizes]] a small amount of fuel (the wax). Once vaporized, the fuel combines with [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere to ignite and form a constant [[flame]]. This flame provides sufficient heat to keep the candle burning via a self-sustaining chain of events: the heat of the flame melts the top of the mass of solid fuel; the liquefied fuel then moves upward through the wick via [[capillary action]]; the liquefied fuel finally vaporizes to burn within the candle's flame.\n\nAs the fuel (wax) is melted and burned, the candle becomes shorter. Portions of the wick that are not emitting vaporized fuel are consumed in the flame. The incineration of the wick limits the length of the exposed portion of the wick, thus maintaining a constant burning temperature and rate of fuel consumption. Some wicks require regular trimming with scissors (or a specialized wick trimmer), usually to about one-quarter inch (~0.7&nbsp;cm), to promote slower, steady burning, and also to prevent smoking. Special candle-scissors called \"[[Candle snuffer|snuffers]]\" were produced for this purpose in the 20th century and were often combined with an extinguisher. In modern candles, the wick is constructed so that it curves over as it burns.  This ensures that the end of the wick gets oxygen and is then consumed by [[fire]]\u2014a self-trimming wick.<ref>[http://www.eca-candles.com/design.php?rubrik=29&topnav=6&sprach_id=en&SID=ksqhyfiz European Candle Association FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113154928/http://www.eca-candles.com/design.php?rubrik=29&topnav=6&sprach_id=en&SID=ksqhyfiz |date=2012-01-13 }}.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word candle comes from Middle English ''candel'', from Old English and from Anglo-Norman ''candele'', both from Latin ''cand\u0113la'', from ''cand\u0113re'', to shine.<ref name=Farlex>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/candle |title=Candle |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of candle making}}\n[[File:Roman oil lamp.jpg|thumb|Roman oil lamp]]\nPrior to the candle, people used [[oil lamp]]s in which a lit wick rested in a container of liquid oil.

Commercial wicks are made from braided cotton.  The wick's [[capillary action|capillarity]] determines the rate at which the melted hydrocarbon is conveyed to the flame.  If the capillarity is too great, the molten wax streams down the side of the candle.  Wicks are often infused with a variety of [[chemical]]s to modify their burning characteristics.  For example, it is usually desirable that the wick not glow after the flame is extinguished.

The zone also contains unburnt carbon particles. Temperature is around {{convert|1200|C|F}}.\n* Zone V - The non-luminous  ''outer zone'' or ''veil'' surrounds Zone IV.

The best way to avoid getting burned from splashed wax is to use a [[candle snuffer]] instead of blowing on the flame. A candle snuffer is usually a small metal cup on the end of a long handle. Placing the snuffer over the flame cuts off the oxygen supply. Snuffers were common in the home when candles were the main source of lighting before electric lights were available.  Ornate snuffers, often combined with a taper for lighting, are still found in those churches which regularly use large candles.\n\nGlass candle-holders are sometimes cracked by thermal shock from the candle flame, particularly when the candle burns down to the end. When burning candles in glass holders or jars, users should avoid lighting candles with chipped or cracked containers, and stop use once 1/2&nbsp;inch or less of wax remains.\n\nA former worry regarding the safety of candles was that a [[lead]] core was used in the wicks to keep them upright in container candles. Without a stiff core, the wicks of a container candle could sag and drown in the deep wax pool. Concerns rose that the lead in these wicks would vaporize during the burning process, releasing lead vapors \u2014 a known health and developmental hazard. Lead core wicks have not been common since the 1970s. Today, most metal-cored wicks use [[zinc]] or a zinc [[alloy]], which has become the industry standard. Wicks made from specially treated paper and cotton are also available.\n\n==Regulation==\nInternational markets have developed a range of standards and [[regulation]]s to ensure compliance, while maintaining and improving [[safety]], including:\n* Europe: GPSD, EN 15493, EN 15494, EN 15426, EN 14059, [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]], RAL-GZ 041 Candles (Germany), French Decree 91-1175\n* United States: ASTM F2058, ASTM F2179, ASTM F2417, ASTM F2601, ASTM F2326, [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|California Proposition 65]], CONEG\n* China: QB/T 2119 Basic Candle, QB/T 2902 Art Candle, QB/T 2903 Jar Candle, GB/T 22256 Jelly Candle\n\n==Accessories==\n[[File:Wick-Trimmer.jpg|thumb|Wick-trimmer]]\n===Candle holders===\nDecorative candleholders, especially those shaped as a pedestal, are called [[candlestick]]s; if multiple candle tapers are held, the term ''candelabrum'' is also used. The root form of ''[[chandelier]]'' is from the word for candle, but now usually refers to an electric fixture. The word ''chandelier'' is sometimes now used to describe a hanging fixture designed to hold multiple tapers.\n\nMany candle holders use a friction-tight socket to keep the candle upright. In this case, a candle that is slightly too wide will not fit in the holder, and a candle that is slightly too narrow will wobble. Candles that are too big can be trimmed to fit with a knife; candles that are too small can be fitted with aluminium foil. Traditionally, the candle and candle holders were made in the same place, so they were appropriately sized, but [[common market|international trade]] has combined the modern candle with existing holders, which makes the ill-fitting candle more common. This friction tight socket is only needed for the federals and the tapers. For [[tea light]] candles, there is a variety of candle holders, including small glass holders and elaborate multi-candle stands. The same is true for [[votive candle|votives]]. Wall sconces are available for tea light and votive candles. For pillar-type candles, the assortment of candle holders is broad. A fireproof plate, such as a glass plate or small mirror, can be a candle holder for a pillar-style candle. A pedestal of any kind, with the appropriate-sized fireproof top, is another option. A large glass bowl with a large flat bottom and tall mostly vertical curved sides is called a hurricane. The pillar-style candle is placed at the bottom center of the hurricane. A hurricane on a pedestal is sometimes sold as a unit.\n\nA [[bob\u00e8che]] is a drip-catching ring, which may also be affixed to a candle holder, or used independently of one. Bob\u00e8ches can range from ornate metal or glass to simple plastic, cardboard, or wax paper. Use of paper or plastic bob\u00e8ches is common at events where candles are distributed to a crowd or audience, such as Christmas carolers or people at other concerts/festivals.\n\n===Candle followers===\nThese are glass or metal tubes with an internal stricture partway along, which sit around the top of a lit candle. As the candle burns, the wax melts and the follower holds the melted wax in, whilst the stricture rests on the topmost solid portion of wax. Candle followers are often deliberately heavy or weighted to ensure they move down as the candle burns lower, maintaining a seal and preventing wax escape. The purpose of a candle follower is threefold:\n* To contain the melted wax, making the candle more efficient, avoiding mess, and producing a more even burn.\n* As a decoration, either due to the ornate nature of the device, or (in the case of a glass follower) through light dispersion or colouration.\n* If necessary, to shield the flame from wind.\n\nCandle followers are often found in churches on [[altar candle]]s.\n\n===Candle snuffers===\n{{main|Candle snuffer}}\nCandle snuffers are instruments used to extinguish burning candles by smothering the flame with a small metal cup that is suspended from a long handle, and thus depriving it of oxygen. An older meaning refers to a scissor-like tool used to trim the wick of a candle. With skill, this could be done without extinguishing the flame. The instrument now known as a candle snuffer was formerly called an \"extinguisher\" or \"douter\".\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Candle-making]]\n* [[Candle warmer]]\n* [[Candelabra]]\n* [[Julleuchter]]\n* [[Outdoor candle]]\n* [[Rushlight]]\n* [[Singing candle]]\n* [[Tealight]]\n* [[Trick candles]]\n* [[Trudon]]\n* [[Unity candle]]\n* [[Yahrzeit candle]]{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Candles}}\n{{CE1913 poster|Candles}}\n* {{Commons category-inline|Candles}}\n* [http://www.candles.org/ National Candle Association] of the [[United States|U.S.]]\n* [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14474 The Chemical History of a Candle] by Michael Faraday\n* [http://www.europecandles.org/ Association of European Candlemakers(AECM)]\n* [http://www.eca-candles.eu/ European Candle Association (ECA)]\n* [http://www.alafave.org/ Latin American Candle Manufacturers Association (ALAFAVE)]\n* [https://www.osmology.co/blog/candle-safety/ Guide To Candle Safety At Home - Osmology]\n\n{{Artificial light sources}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Candles| ]]\n", "name_user": "2600:1700:30c1:a10:88d3:1565:78ba:7524", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle"}
