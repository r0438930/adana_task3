The album presents a recording of the 1957 [[JATP|Jazz at the Philharmonic Concerts]]. This series of live jazz concerts was devised by Fitzgerald's manager [[Norman Granz]]; they ran from 1944 to 1983. Featured on this occasion, in 1957, are Fitzgerald and the leading jazz players of the day in an onstage jam session. The first half of the 1990 CD edition includes a performance that was recorded on September 29, 1957 at the [[Chicago Opera House]], whilst the second half highlights the concert recorded on October 7, 1957 at the [[Shrine Auditorium]], in [[Los Angeles]]. The original LP obviously included only the mono tracks (#10-18).\n\nThis album is typical of Ella's concert repertoire in the mid 1950s, singing swing standards, and songs referencing her recent 'Songbook' series, in this case, the [[Cole Porter]] and [[Rodgers and Hart]] songbooks.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 =[[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}} <ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Yanow |title= ''Ella at the Opera House'' > Review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id= r138687 |pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=June 28, 2011}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin|title=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|year=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|edition=4th|isbn=978-0195313734|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n}}\n\n#\"[[It's All Right with Me]]\" ([[Cole Porter]]) &nbsp;\u2013 2:32\n#\"[[Don'cha Go 'Way Mad]]\" ([[Jimmy Mundy]], [[Illinois Jacquet]], [[Al Stillman]]) &nbsp;\u2013 2:42\n#\"[[Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered]]\" ([[Richard Rodgers]], [[Lorenz Hart]]) &nbsp;\u2013 3:01\n#\"[[These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)]]\" ([[Jack Strachey]], [[Harry Link]], [[Eric Maschwitz|Holt Marvell]]) &nbsp;\u2013 3:46\n#\"[[Ill Wind (Arlen-Koehler song)|Ill Wind]]\" ([[Harold Arlen]], [[Ted Koehler]]) &nbsp;\u2013 2:47\n#\"[[Goody Goody]]\" ([[Johnny Mercer]], [[Matty Malneck]]) &nbsp;\u2013 1:54\n#\"[[Moonlight in Vermont (song)|Moonlight in Vermont]]\" ([[Karl Suessdorf]], [[John Blackburn (songwriter)|John Blackburn]]) &nbsp;\u2013 3:06\n#\"[[Them There Eyes]]\" ([[Maceo Pinkard]], Doris Tauber, William Tracey) &nbsp;\u2013 2:08\n#\"[[Stompin' at the Savoy]]\" ([[Benny Goodman]], [[Edgar Sampson]], [[Chick Webb]], [[Andy Razaf]]) &nbsp;\u2013 5:14\n\n''Tracks 1-9 recorded in [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] on the 29th of September 1957 at the [[Chicago Opera House]].''\n\n#<li value=\"10\">\"It's All Right with Me\" &nbsp;\u2013 2:45\n#\"Don'cha Go Way Mad\" &nbsp;\u2013 2:31\n#\"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\" &nbsp;\u2013 3:22\n#\"These Foolish Things\" &nbsp;\u2013 3:49\n#\"Ill Wind\" &nbsp;\u2013 2:53\n#\"Goody Goody\" &nbsp;\u2013 1:55\n#\"Moonlight in Vermont\" &nbsp;\u2013 3:15\n#\"Stompin' at the Savoy\" &nbsp;\u2013 7:15\n#\"[[Oh, Lady Be Good!]]\" ([[George Gershwin]], [[Ira Gershwin]]) &nbsp;\u2013 4:25\n\n''Tracks 10-18 recorded in [[Monaural|mono]] on the 7th of October 1957 at the [[Shrine Auditorium]], [[Los Angeles]].''\n\n==Personnel==\n===Tracks 1-16===\n* [[Ella Fitzgerald]] - Vocals\n* [[Oscar Peterson]] - Piano\n* [[Herb Ellis]] - Guitar\n* [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]] - Bass\n* [[Jo Jones]] - Drums\n\n===Tracks 17-18===\n* [[Ella Fitzgerald]] - Vocals\n* [[Oscar Peterson]] - Piano\n* [[Herb Ellis]] - Guitar\n* [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]] - Bass\n* [[Connie Kay]] - Drums\n* [[Roy Eldridge]] - Trumpet\n* [[J.
