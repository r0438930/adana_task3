The dialogue format allowed the reader to understand the respective perspectives of the various market participants and the intricacies of speculation and trading. There is evidence in Confusion de Confusiones of three major biases: [[herding]], [[overconfidence]], and regret [[aversion]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}.<ref>Teresa Corzo, Margarita Prat & Esther Vaquero (2014) Behavioral Finance in Joseph de la Vega's Confusion de Confusiones, Journal of Behavioral Finance, 15:4, 341-350, DOI: 10.1080/15427560.2014.968722</ref>  The book is written in Spanish; its original title is ''Confusi\u00f3n de Confusiones''.<ref>It is possible to read it in a full view mode here [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?view=1up;size=100;id=uc1.32106019504239;page=root;seq=1;orient=0] or buy here {{cite web |url=http://books.global-investor.com/books/247231/Josseph-De-la-Vega/Confusion-of-Confusions/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329174819/http://books.global-investor.com/books/247231/Josseph-De-la-Vega/Confusion-of-Confusions/ |archivedate=2014-03-29 }}.</ref>\n\n{{cns|date=May 2018|text=Joseph also came up with four basic rules of the share market that are still of the greatest relevance today:}}\n\n<blockquote>\n''The first rule in speculation is: Never advise anyone to buy or sell shares. Where guessing correctly is a form of witchcraft, counsel cannot be put on airs.''\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n''The second rule: Accept both your profits and regrets. It is best to seize what comes to hand when it comes, and not expect that your good fortune and the favorable circumstances will last.''\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n''The third rule: Profit in the share market is goblin treasure: at one moment, it is [[carbuncle (gemstone)|carbuncle]]s, the next it is coal; one moment diamonds, and the next pebbles. Sometimes, they are the tears that Aurora leaves on the sweet morning's grass, at other times, they are just tears.''\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n''The fourth rule: He who wishes to become rich from this game must have both money and patience.''\n</blockquote>\n\nConfusion de Confusiones remained little known until the German economist [[Richard Ehrenberg]] published an influential essay in the 1892 Jahrb\u00fccher f\u00fcr National\u00f6konomie und Statistik, \u201cDie Amsterdame Aktienspekulation un 17.
