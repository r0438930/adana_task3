In 1967, [[Holyoke Water Power Company]] (HWP) (formed in 1859) joined the NU System, and in 1992 the '''Public Service Company of New Hampshire''' ([[PSNH]], formed in 1926) followed.\n\nAfter some up-and-down growth under CEO [[Lelan Sillin]] (1970\u20131983) and his successor, William B. Ellis, PSNH declared bankruptcy in January 1988 due to problems getting a license for the completed [[Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/29/business/bankruptcy-filed-by-leading-utility-in-seabrook-plant.html |author=Lee A.

In 1999 the company divested all of the generating assets of WMECO and CL&P per requirements of the Massachusetts and Connecticut legislation. The company retained some of these assets by transferring them to a new subsidiary called Northeast Generation which functioned as a competitive supplier and sold the other assets entirely: WMECO's [[West Springfield Generating Station]] and several related hydroelectric and fossil fuel generating units were sold to Con Edison, while other assets (most notably the [[Northfield Mountain hydroelectric facility]]) were transferred to Northeast Generation.\n\nIn 2001, NU sold the assets and operations of its subsidiary, the Holyoke Water Power Company, to the [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|City of Holyoke]] including the HWP electrical distribution system and customer base and all generation with the exception of the [[Mount Tom Station|Mt. Tom coal-fired power plant]] which NU retained.

PSNH continued to operate regulated hydroelectric and fossil fuel generation assets to serve its default/basic service customers who did not choose an alternative competitive supplier.\n\nIn October 2010, Northeast Utilities announced that it would merge with [[NSTAR (company)|NSTAR]], the major electric and gas provider in [[Greater Boston]], with the resulting company retaining the Northeast Utilities name for the next several years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2010/10/northeast_utili_2.html|title=NStar and Northeast Utilities agree to merger|last=Ailworth|first=Erin|date=2010-10-18|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=2010-10-18}}</ref>  After government approvals, the deal closed in April 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nu-closes-nstar-merger-deal-223023927.html|title=NU Closes NSTAR Merger Deal|date=2012-04-11|accessdate=2013-05-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 the company (now known as Eversource) agreed to sell all of its New Hampshire generation assets in the same manner it sold its assets in Massachusetts and Connecticut between 2000 and 2006.

The first project was construction of the $350 million 345 kilovolt [[Bethel-Norwalk transmission line]] through the western part of the state, and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as Northeast Utilities.\n\nWith [[United Illuminating]], an upgrade to the 69-mile (112&nbsp;km), 345 kilovolt [[Middletown-Norwalk transmission line]] was energized in 2009 at a cost of $900 million.\n\nIn 2013, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, a component of the ongoing New England East-West Solution, was energized at a cost of $795 million. The project addressed numerous reliability issues with the Springfield, MA area's 115 kV transmission system by constructing two new 345 kV lines to the Agawam substation; one line north to Ludlow and the other south to North Bloomfield, Connecticut.\n\nThe new 345 kV corridor added a new strong interface between Massachusetts and Connecticut. The project also involved rebuilding all of the 115 kV lines along the transmission corridor between South Agawam and Ludlow to increase their capacities, building a new 115 kV transmission substation in East Springfield (Cadwell), replacing the Fairmont 115 kV transmission substation in Chicopee with a new substation across the street, and configuring a new 115 kV line from South Agawam to Southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former 115 kV path between Agawam and North Bloomfield. The new Cadwell and Fairmont switching stations allowed a number of three-terminal 115 kV lines to be broken up into two-terminal lines. Finally, the project allowed a problematic underground 115 kV transmission path through the city of Springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle. The underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the Breckwood substation in Springfield. A previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary. On November 20, 2013, cutover of 115 kV lines to the new Fairmont Switching Station was complete, marking substantial completion of the GSRP.\n\nIn May 2016, Eversource began an electrical infrastructure project in QueensBrook. The project involves replacing underground wire and transformers throughout the QB.\n\nEversource has taken action to support the use of [[electric vehicle]]s. Starting in 2018, the company began spending $45 million over five years to install over 400 electric vehicle charging stations in Massachusetts. The project is part of the company's Grid Modernization plan. The company has switched much of its power source from coal to [[natural gas]], wind, [[hydroelectricity]] and solar power.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.masslive.com/business-news/index.ssf/2018/08/eversource_rolls_out_electric_car_charge.html|title=Eversource begins rollout of 400 electric car chargers across Massachusetts; 'range anxiety' seen as enemy to emissions progress|work=masslive.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==HVDC transmission (\"Northern Pass\" Project)==\nAs Northeast Utilities the company signed on a joint venture with [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]] and [[NSTAR (company)|NSTAR]] to build a new [[High-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) line from [[Windsor, Quebec]] (connecting with the [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's electricity transmission system|Quebec grid]]) to a location in [[Franklin, New Hampshire]].  It is projected that the line will either run in an existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains.  This 180- to 190-mile line, projected to carry 1,200 megawatts, will carry electricity to approximately one million homes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rutlandherald.com/article/20081219/NEWS03/812190315/1004/NEWS03 |title=Utilities plan for N.E. expansion |work=Rutland Herald |first=Louis |last=Porter |date=19 December 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615232130/http://www.rutlandherald.com/article/20081219/NEWS03/812190315/1004/NEWS03 |archive-date=15 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The issue of buying hydropower from Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec had been an issue during the [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2010|Massachusetts gubernatorial election of 2010]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Beth |last=Daley |title=Canadian firm offers N.E. more hydropower |work=The Boston Globe |date=2010-10-23 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/10/23/canadian_firm_offers_ne_more_hydropower/?page=full |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> In November 2015, the [[Sierra Club]] of New Hampshire also expressed opposition for the new line, saying that it would not only benefit Connecticut and Massachusetts residents more than those in New Hampshire, but also the concern of the flooding of [[Boreal forest of Canada|Boreal forests]] during the construction of Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's dams in northern Quebec, disputes with the [[Innu]] First Nations, and the effects of tourism and the environment within the [[White Mountain National Forest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/quebec-is-facing-its-own-dirty-energy-problem/article27502571/?click=sf_globefb|title=Quebec is facing its own \u2018dirty\u2019 energy export problem|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn January 25, 2018, Massachusetts Governor Baker selected this \"Northern Pass Transmission\" (NPT) project<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://commonwealthmagazine.org/energy/baker-goes-eversources-northern-pass/|title=Baker goes with Eversource\u2019s Northern Pass - CommonWealth Magazine|date=2018-01-25|work=CommonWealth Magazine|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en-US}}</ref> as the winner for a clean energy procurement RFP.\n\nHowever, days later on February 1, 2018, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee voted unanimously to deny<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2018/02/01/committee-votes-against-northern-pass|title=N.H.

In 1967, [[Holyoke Water Power Company]] (HWP) (formed in 1859) joined the NU System, and in 1992 the '''Public Service Company of New Hampshire''' ([[PSNH]], formed in 1926) followed.\n\nAfter some up-and-down growth under CEO [[Lelan Sillin]] (1970\u20131983) and his successor, William B.

In 1999 the company divested all of the generating assets of WMECO and CL&P per requirements of the Massachusetts and Connecticut legislation. The company retained some of these assets by transferring them to a new subsidiary called Northeast Generation which functioned as a competitive supplier and sold the other assets entirely: WMECO's [[West Springfield Generating Station]] and several related hydroelectric and fossil fuel generating units were sold to Con Edison, while other assets (most notably the [[Northfield Mountain hydroelectric facility]]) were transferred to Northeast Generation.\n\nIn 2001, NU sold the assets and operations of its subsidiary, the Holyoke Water Power Company, to the [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|City of Holyoke]] including the HWP electrical distribution system and customer base and all generation with the exception of the [[Mount Tom Station|Mt. Tom coal-fired power plant]] which NU retained.

The first project was construction of the $350 million 345 kilovolt [[Bethel-Norwalk transmission line]] through the western part of the state, and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as Northeast Utilities.\n\nWith [[United Illuminating]], an upgrade to the 69-mile (112&nbsp;km), 345 kilovolt [[Middletown-Norwalk transmission line]] was energized in 2009 at a cost of $900 million.\n\nIn 2013, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, a component of the ongoing New England East-West Solution, was energized at a cost of $795 million. The project addressed numerous reliability issues with the Springfield, MA area's 115 kV transmission system by constructing two new 345 kV lines to the Agawam substation; one line north to Ludlow and the other south to North Bloomfield, Connecticut.\n\nThe new 345 kV corridor added a new strong interface between Massachusetts and Connecticut. The project also involved rebuilding all of the 115 kV lines along the transmission corridor between South Agawam and Ludlow to increase their capacities, building a new 115 kV transmission substation in East Springfield (Cadwell), replacing the Fairmont 115 kV transmission substation in Chicopee with a new substation across the street, and configuring a new 115 kV line from South Agawam to Southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former 115 kV path between Agawam and North Bloomfield. The new Cadwell and Fairmont switching stations allowed a number of three-terminal 115 kV lines to be broken up into two-terminal lines. Finally, the project allowed a problematic underground 115 kV transmission path through the city of Springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle. The underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the Breckwood substation in Springfield. A previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary. On November 20, 2013, cutover of 115 kV lines to the new Fairmont Switching Station was complete, marking substantial completion of the GSRP.\n\nIn May 2016, Eversource began an electrical infrastructure project in QueensBrook. The project involves replacing underground wire and transformers throughout the QB.\n\nEversource has taken action to support the use of [[electric vehicle]]s. Starting in 2018, the company began spending $45 million over five years to install over 400 electric vehicle charging stations in Massachusetts. The project is part of the company's Grid Modernization plan. The company has switched much of its power source from coal to [[natural gas]], wind, [[hydroelectricity]] and solar power.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.masslive.com/business-news/index.ssf/2018/08/eversource_rolls_out_electric_car_charge.html|title=Eversource begins rollout of 400 electric car chargers across Massachusetts; 'range anxiety' seen as enemy to emissions progress|work=masslive.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==HVDC transmission (\"Northern Pass\" Project)==\nAs Northeast Utilities the company signed on a joint venture with [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]] and [[NSTAR (company)|NSTAR]] to build a new [[High-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) line from [[Windsor, Quebec]] (connecting with the [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's electricity transmission system|Quebec grid]]) to a location in [[Franklin, New Hampshire]].  It is projected that the line will either run in an existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains.

I'm not happy with the lack of information my office has received.\" Golden, co-chairman of the Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, helped write the 2016 law that permits utilities to levy a new minimum monthly charge, and he told Eversource executives they were making it \"extremely, extremely difficult\" for him to continue to support them in the policy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lowellsun.com/breakingnews/ci_31633713/frustration-grows-over-eversource-solar-charge|title=Golden, Barrett upset over Eversource solar charge|access-date=2018-02-11}}</ref>\n\n== Price manipulation controversy ==\nIn 2017, an environmental group accused Eversource and Avangrid of driving up electric, gas rates over several winters<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/talking-points/2017/10/13/the-week-business/Eooyag6H74Q83W4JewxSvI/story.html|title=The week in business - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref> by buying up shipment capacity on a major pipeline that they ultimately did not use. The Environmental Defense Fund said both utilities routinely reserved big deliveries of natural gas on the Algonquin pipeline system for frigid days, but then sharply reduced those orders too late in the day for others to use that capacity. Those orders had the effect of driving up wholesale prices for natural gas during peak winter heating periods and in turn increasing the costs of electricity generated by gas-fired power plants. The two utilities \u201cengaged in behavior that would tend to have the largest impact on prices,\u201d said N.
