Barnett's grandson, Doug Barnett, gives the date 1884. He writes: \"In February 1883 he travelled north in a buckboard with four horses as far as the Red Deer River. The only source of supplies was by a wagon train running every week or so between Calgary and Edmonton. Ed came across a couple of drifters and the three of them built a log cabin by the Red Deer River where they remained over the winter of 1883-84. They survived the winter on a diet of rabbit and flour until spring brought a welcome addition of ducks and geese from the south. Barnett was still looking for a good place to start ranching and farming. He therefore moved farther north in the summer of 1884, across the Blindman River to the area where Lacombe stands today.\" See [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ed+Barnett%3A+from+mountie+to+rancher.-a0167508634 Barnett, Doug.

Barnett was a retired member of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (NWMP) who had served a mere three years. He left [[Fort Macleod]] in August 1881 at 23 years of age. According to his own diary and his official obituary in the RCMP Quarterly, spring 1940, on July 19, 1881, Barnett was among a small NWMP party that escorted Chief Sitting Bull and his people to the Canada\u2013US border. Along the Calgary-Edmonton Trail, he established a \"[[stopping house]]\" for travelers on a land grant given to him for serving his service in the NWMP. His family and friends from Ontario moved out and the community began to grow.

The only source of supplies was by a wagon train running every week or so between Calgary and Edmonton. Ed came across a couple of drifters and the three of them built a log cabin by the Red Deer River where they remained over the winter of 1883-84. They survived the winter on a diet of rabbit and flour until spring brought a welcome addition of ducks and geese from the south. Barnett was still looking for a good place to start ranching and farming. He therefore moved farther north in the summer of 1884, across the Blindman River to the area where Lacombe stands today.\" See [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ed+Barnett%3A+from+mountie+to+rancher.-a0167508634 Barnett, Doug.
